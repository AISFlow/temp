42427820,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL40Bh,1506375346,Ukrainian Central Banker: Bitcoin Is 'Definitely Not a Currency',"Ukraine does not recognize bitcoin as a currency or as a medium of exchange, an official at the country's central bank has said.  ""We can say that this is definitely not a currency, because there is no central issuer. And we cannot recognize this as a means of payment,"" said Oleg Churiy, deputy head of the National Bank of Ukraine, according to a report Friday by the Ukrainian website Financial Club, as translated by Google.  Echoing recent comments by senior financial services executives in the U.S., the Ukrainian central banker described bitcoin as a risky investment for consumers and a vehicle for fraud. But he downplayed any systemic concerns about bitcoin and its brethren.  ""World regulators are not concerned with any threat of cryptocurrency because of their small volume,"" Churiy said at the Ukranian Financial Forum. ""They are concerned only with the fact that people can lose money [by investing in them]. And fraud that can be [committed] with them.""  The Ukrainian central bank has been warning about the risks of bitcoin for several years, and last month it indicated it may soon regulate the use of cryptocurrencies.  Yet at the same time, Ukraine’s government has recently been testing the distributed-ledger technology that bitcoin inspired, in a novel use case: auctioning seized assets.  Bitcoin has even figured in Ukrainian politics in recent years, with separatists and other political dissidents using the permissionless, borderless system to raise and transfer funds.

42427816,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL409h,1506371732,Nigerian Central Bank Director: Cryptocurrency Wave 'Cannot Be Stopped',"The Central Bank of Nigeria is said to be taking a closer look at blockchains and cryptocurrencies.  According to a report in The Guardian this week, Musa Jimoh, a deputy director at the country's central bank, recently spoke at a cryptocurrency-focused conference in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city. There, Jimoh indicated that the Central Bank of Nigeria is preparing a white paper on the subject.  Perhaps most notable, however, was how Jimoh framed the reason for the study, noting the central bank ""cannot stop the tide of waves generated by the blockchain technology and its derivatives."" Such comments carry extra weight coming from the institution that oversees domestic monetary policy as well as banking sector regulation.  In his remarks, Jimoh also noted that the nature of the technology, which gives users autonomy over the private keys that access blockchain-linked data, enables the creation of forms of money that are ""beyond restriction and confiscation.""  Elsewhere, attendees surveyed at the conference painted a generally positive picture of how the technology is progressing domestically. Other topics addressed included how blockchains can help move payments across borders, and the investment risks associated with the nascent technology.  Dr. David Isiawe, president of the Information Security Society of Nigeria, also spoke to the general consensus, when he was quoted as saying the technology is a reality that must be faced by the country's leaders ""whether we like it or not.""  Such comments also coincide with a growing acknowledgment of the technology in Nigeria, and the issues with a relatively immature market. So far this year, domestic regulators, the Central Bank of Nigeria included, have issued two warnings about the technology.

42427823,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL40Hh,1506366904,Miner Argument Continues Over Ethereum's Byzantium Economics,"A dispute between some ethereum developers and miners is continuing to simmer over the specifics of a coming upgrade designed to improve the network's functionality.  The discussion, which has been underway since at least July, currently concerns an ethereum improvement protocol, EIP 649, intended to reduce the time it takes to ""mine"" a transaction block, a process for which miners are rewarded with the creation of new ether, the platform's native cryptocurrency.  Key to the dispute is that, after the migration, nicknamed ""Byzantium,"" blocks would be mined in about 10 seconds faster than they are today. But, to ensure that this does not deflate the value of ether, currently valued at around $300, the code patch also lowers the reward miners receive per block from 5 ETH ($1,200) to 3 ETH ($840).  Stepping back, the change can be seen as a response to long-controversial code in the ethereum protocol called the difficulty bomb.  An incremental increase of difficulty, pre-configured into the protocol, the difficulty bomb is designed to make blocks steadily less time-efficient to mine. But while the code is intended to incentivize miners to switch to a different chain in the case of a fork, critics fear that, combined with the decline in block reward, it could have the opposite effect.  As the change will impact different stakeholders in different ways, it's hard to get everybody on board with the idea. Some commentators have gone so far as portraying the EIP as an attack on miners with the resources to mine harder blocks with greater rewards.  At press time, the argument continues, though it remains unclear whether the posts represent a material number of stakeholders, and if they do, how their acknowledgment might shift the conversation around Byzantium, currently planned for late October.  The dispute can also be seen as a continuation of the conflict surrounding an older protocol update, named EIP 186. Detailed by CoinDesk earlier this year, the EIP suggested reducing the block award to combat inflation of the currency – a code patch which was widely accepted by the community, and as a result, informed the current EIP.  Still, such semantics could emerge as a topic of interest ahead given the mechanics of the Byzantium upgrade. At the time the new code is introduced as a hard fork, miners will be able to choose to switch to the new blockchain with the new rule set, or continue mining the older version of the blockchain.  Of note is that a similar split happened in 2016, when following a disagreement, certain miners refused to leave the old blockchain, continuing to mine a currency now called ethereum classic (ETC).

As a China-based project, neo (formerly antshares) perhaps bore most of the brunt of the decision by the country's regulators to ban initial coin offerings (ICOs), falling nearly 40% over the day's trading on September 4. However, neo appears to now be recovering, posting a strong 10% gain today amid a dull market.  A general purpose blockchain designed to run smart contracts, and available in languages C#, Java and Go, the neo token topped out at $58.50 in mid-August and fell to a low of $13 on September 15. The ensuing recovery in cryptocurrencies has helped neo, issued in a 2016 ICO, regain poise.  Week-on-week, neo is up 21%, and though lightyears from its record highs, this marks a notable improvement on its 36% decline over the last 30 days.  That said, volumes remain low and below the 30-day average. As such, the positive momentum seen today needs to be maintained as price rise would boost confidence among investors about neo's long-term viability. A sustained rise could end up being a self-feeding cycle.  Price action analysis says the rally seen today could be extended to $30 levels in the short-term.  Bullish falling channel breakout  Daily chart  A falling channel or a descending channel is the price action contained between two downward sloping parallel lines. An upside break is usually a confirmation of bearish-to-bullish trend change.  In neo's case, an upside break of the falling channel looks like a done deal.  The 14-day relative strength index [RSI] is nicely curled up in favor of the bulls.  The chart above also shows a nice higher lows formation along the 100-day moving average  View  Neo looks set to test the 50-day moving average level of $30. A break higher would open doors for $45.  On the downside, only an end of the day close below the 100-day moving average would abort the bullish view.

In a September 22 statement, the commission said that, from January 2018, a new framework will regulate companies using blockchain to ""store or transmit value belonging to others."" Further, it said initial coin offerings (ICOs) might also come under regulatory oversight in the near future, with the commission explaining it is ""considering a complementary regulatory framework covering the promotion and sale of tokens, aligned with the DLT framework.""  Currently, ICO investment schemes are unregulated, the watchdog said, meaning investors have no recourse to any financial compensation scheme or ombudsman.  The statement cautioned the public to ensure they are aware of the ""highly-speculative and risky"" nature of the token sale funding method.  It reads:  ""ICOs are an unregulated means of raising finance in a venture or project, usually at an early-stage and often one whose products and services have not yet been significantly designed, built or tested, yet alone made operational or generating revenue.""  Over the past month, several authorities from across the world have made similar statements warning of the risks of ICO schemes.

Conceived as a ""knowledge centre for the regional private sector"" and geared towards applied research, the so-called ""BlockLab"" is being set up in a joint effort between the Municipality of Rotterdam and the port authority to investigate blockchain's potential in organising port logistics and cargo flows more efficiently.  According to a press release, initial steps include the launch of a blockchain app – developed in partnership with cloud software company Exact and ABN AMRO bank – to assist stock financing in the port logistics sector.  Maarten Struijvenberg, Rotterdam's deputy mayor for economic affairs, commented:  ""There's this huge buzz about 'blockchain', but actually, there aren't that many fully functional applications. We'll be changing this with BlockLab. This is important, because we need real innovations to launch the next economy. And blockchain can help us realise them.""

The release also reveals an interest in exploring blockchain to give a boost to what it calls ""energy transition"" – for example, allowing firms to trade residual heat and the city's occupants to trade electricity.  This is not the first effort that the port has made within the blockchain space.

42427833,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL40Xh,1506344414,Wait and Watch? Bitcoin Prices Hover Near Make or Break Level,"What's behind bitcoin's recent lethargic price action?  Well, for one, investors appear to be waiting on the sidelines as they seek clarity out of China following news that the country's exchanges will shut down operations by October's end. Traders, it seems, are in no mood to take up big positions, as evidenced by the drop in the volumes.  But, coinciding with this decline has been lack of substance in the bitcoin-U.S. dollar (BTC/USD) exchange rate.  After a rally from the September 15 low of $2,908, bears made their presence felt but were reluctant to push the digital currency back to $3,000 levels. The weak selling pressure helped BTC regain some poise, although gains are now being capped at the key downward sloping trend line hurdle.  Since Friday, the BTC/USD exchange rate has been hovering in the narrow range of $3,600–$3,800. According to the CoinDesk BPI, the cryptocurrency has traded below $4,000 since September 14.  While China could be blamed for the lack of price action, one must not forget that the cryptocurrency rally was overstretched. Thus, a healthy correction and the current pause may be a blessing in disguise.  As per CoinMarketCap, bitcoin has added 2.2 percent in the last 24 hours, trading at $3,775 at press time. Week-on-week, bitcoin is down 7.92 percent and, for the month, the digital currency has lost 13.4 percent.  The price action analysis suggests the cryptocurrency is chipping away at the key trend line resistance, where a violation would open doors for a revisit to $4,200–$4,300 levels.  Make or break level  Daily chart  The trend line sloping downwards from the September 2 high and September 8 high is offering resistance around $3,830.  Scenarios  – Price breaks above the trend line and prices rise  Such a move would add credence to last week's bullish doji reversal and higher lows pattern, and may open the doors for $4,300.  A doji candlestick forms when a security's open and close are virtually equal and signals reversal, which depends on the follow through. In bitcoin's case, Friday's doji candle was followed by a positive price action on Saturday. Thus, a bullish doji reversal was confirmed.  – Trendline hurdle holds and prices drop below Friday's low  Failure at the trend line hurdle followed by a drop below $3,509 would signal a continuation of lower highs and lower lows pattern. This, coupled with the bearish daily relative strength index (RSI) would indicate a potential for a sell-off to $2,980 (September 15 low).

Revealed today, the London-based bank will now work alongside the group's other members, including JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of China, in a bid to bring new levels of efficiency and security to the forex settlements industry. First revealed last year, the CLS consortium specifically aims to use the open-source Hyperledger Fabric blockchain to create new channels for foreign exchange.  Demoed at Swift's annual Sibos conference last autumn, the group's blockchain platform is designed to be a new way for buy-side and sell-side institutions to exchange 140 global currencies that are now settled outside of the existing CLS settlement service.  According to Lee Braine, from the Barclays Investment Bank's CTO office, his institution became interested in the project partly because the CLS platform will operate side-by-side with the existing Swift solution – at least for now – rather than being forced on customers.  Braine told CoinDesk:  ""People can connect via Swift or via a new [distributed ledger technology] connection mechanism. So, you have a choice.""  In its initial incarnation, the platform, called CLS Net, is expected to let participants trade global currencies using six different kinds of blockchain-based products.  The netting services amount to a new line of business for CLS, which traditionally uses its own payment-versus-payment settlement service linked to the real-time gross settlement systems of 18 currencies.  A representative of CLS confirmed that progress on the expanded blockchain functionality is ""proceeding well.""  Blockchain evolution  Providing more detail about what attracted Barclays to the CLS consortium, Braine pointed to the desire for ""harmonious"" functionality with Swift's foreign exchange service.  Instead of what he called a ""Big Bang"" implementation of blockchain (wherein entire consortia of institutions convert to blockchain-based systems), Braine described a tiered system of integration he imagines might be useful to the group.  He breaks down this ""incremental roadmap"" into 10 layers, with the lowest level of blockchain adoption requiring only existing technology plugged into a third-party blockchain provider. The highest level, by contrast, would see transactions being fully reliant on distributed ledgers without a centralized backup system.  Braine hopes the lessons Barclays learns about how this work might play out in the real world will inform other blockchain projects.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We envisage banks could be at different levels of integration for particular use cases, and yet still being able to participate.""

42427818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL403h,1506337221,Centers for Disease Control to Launch First Blockchain Test on Disaster Relief,"For public health practitioners, the ability to quickly collect, analyze and take action on data is paramount to containing the spread of a deadly new virus or disease.  But despite the advent of big data technologies, collecting this information today remains a highly cumbersome and time-consuming process, explains Jim Nasr, chief software architect at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services tasked with combating the spread of preventive and chronic disease.  Now in search of a better solution, Nasr is eyeing a blockchain proof-of-concept he believes could facilitate the more rapid and reliable capture of epidemiological data in crisis situations.  The agency will discuss the concept, aimed at public health data surveillance, along with several other PoCs, at the Distributed: Health conference in Nashville on Tuesday.  ""It turns out that there's a lot of manual intervention involved and there's a lot of time lost in this whole process,"" said Nasr, adding:  ""Right now, this is a situation that could literally take months to happen, but with the blockchain it could be done possibly in hours.""  Real-time data  Though one of a number of recently announced blockchain trials within the US government, the CDC's announcement is nonetheless more notable due to high-profile operational struggles its seen in recent years. For example, the CDC was roundly criticized in 2014 for its sluggish response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa, when several unknowingly-infected patients were allowed travel back to the U.S.  To improve its ability to nip these types of crises at the bud, the agency sought to work toward more real-time data flows by breaking down data silos and developing more interoperability between systems.  ""What it comes down to from a software perspective is to get as close as possible to real-time data delivery,"" Nasr said. ""If we're at real time, or what I'd like to think of as 'near-real time,' then the results that we're getting are going to have an impact.""  But, Nasr explained, it turns out that achieving this real-time ""nirvana"" was far easier said than done:  “As we’ve done this, what’s become really evident is that the CDC was never designed to be a clearing house or some sort of Swift settlement area where the data comes in and we eventually sell [it off].""  So, instead of capturing and funneling disparate forms of data into a central registry to be pieced together, cleaned up, validated and then analyzed, the CDC is now looking to process this surveillance data by encrypting it directly from local sources onto a blockchain.  These transaction records would be made available to not just the CDC, but to other nodes – local public health agencies, hospitals, pharmacies – involved in the disaster relief efforts that would be involved in treating the at-risk patients.  ""If I'm in Houston and I’m exposed to standing water for two or three days and potentially exposed to some deadly virus, through this process it could be determined that I need to take some vaccinations and some medication, and I can then provide the consent for that,"" said Nasr.  Why blockchain?  Yet, at a time when many blockchain proofs-of-concept are still struggling to go live, the CDC believes there is real promise in its chosen use case.  The unique urgencies of a disaster response and the disparate nature of the actors involved – CDC staff, local governments, local health workers, contractors, etc. – means that a shared, decentralized and real-time record of truth has significant value over legacy alternatives.  Nasr said that experience has proven that his agency’s legacy data management systems aren't up to the task.  ""We have had Oracle and various other databases up the wazoo for many, many decades, and we've spent a tremendous amount of money on licensing and building these things,"" Nasr explained. ""And as you can tell, we're nowhere near [what a blockchain solution might provide].""  Micah Winkelspecht, chief executive officer of Gem, an enterprise blockchain provider that with a focus on healthcare, reckoned that the parallels between the decentralized nature of disaster relief operations and blockchain make it a strong use case for the technology.  ""I don’t know that a command and control solution really makes sense when we’re talking about real-time actors out in the field trying to work with immediate data,"" he said.  ""Ultimately, disaster relief is a distributed network,"" Winkelspecht continued. “It's a bunch of people on the ground who are really just trying to solve problems locally, and what they need is a really efficient way to share information and data with each other in order to do their jobs and to do it quickly.""  Gem has been in collaboration with the CDC on this and other blockchain PoCs, in addition to Microsoft, IBM and handful of others. The CDC hopes to make a final decision toward the end of the year as to which vendors it will partner with for the project.

According to the Japan Times, the increased scrutiny is aimed to ensure that the companies comply to the revised payment services law, passed in April this year, which set out operational standards for exchanges, as well as recognizing bitcoin as a form of legal tender.  An FSA executive reportedly indicated the surveillance is intended both to regulate the exchanges and to ensure the healthy growth of the cryptocurrency market, saying:  ""We pursue both market fostering and regulation enforcement. ... We aim for sound market development.""  The payment services law passed earlier this year established anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules for the exchanges. The law is also intended to enforce security standards aimed to protect the exchanges from the risk of cyberattack.  The law specifies that all exchanges must report to the authorities by the end of September to confirm they are compliant with the new rules. The FSA also has the remit to conduct on-site inspections if deemed necessary.  To monitor the over 20 cryptocurrency exchanges operating in Japan, the FSA last month established a specialised surveillance team, reportedly comprised of 30 staff members.  Japan is no stranger to cryptocurrency based fraud, with 33 cases, representing more than a half of million dollars-worth of loses, reported in the first seven months of 2017.  Further, in 2014, the now-notorious Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox collapsed, resulting in the loss of millions of dollars in customers' funds. Japanese lawmakers have previously cited the exchange's failure as a key driver in the move to regulate the cryptocurrency industry.

A patent application from FICO, published September 21, details a programmable system for detecting potentially illicit transactions and flagging them for future review. That information would then be used to develop ""threat scores"" to be utilized by bank anti-money laundering specialists, according to the filing.  Included in the document is a description of how the system could be utilized to track information from bitcoin exchanges as part of the scoring model.  The text states:  ""Because emerging payment systems such as mobile and cryptocurrencies may have limited interaction with traditional financial institutions, there are more limited opportunities to detect laundering which involves them. To improve detection, a cloud based data store integrates information from multiple sources, including: ... a) Entities associated with legal and illicit bitcoin exchanges [and] b) Entities associated with mobile payment and remittance networks.""  FICO goes on to state that ""it is important to collect and centralize information on legal exchanges and administrators (miners, etc.),"" indicating that the system could be applied to other parts of the bitcoin ecosystem beyond exchange operators.  Further suggesting that such information might be gathered covertly, the filing adds: ""Having information on legal bitcoin operators helps the AML Threat Score learn their behavior, and detect changes in their behavior that may signal new illicit use (without explicit knowledge of the operator).""

Announced Thursday, the two companies have reportedly agreed to test a system built on technology from the open-source Hyperledger blockchain consortium to determine whether they can use an immutable ledger to record orders, invoices and otherwise collect data about company operations.  The ultimate goal, according to the firms, is to develop a record of every transaction that can be accessible by anyone in the company, thereby streamlining the process needed to order an item.  Right now, Hitachi's process involves ordering an item, confirming the order, creating an invoice and approving the invoice. Due to technical limitations and reliability issues, however, this process does not always work as desired.  Hitachi intends to incorporate its Lumada Internet of Things platform into the test to aid its data collection efforts and continue to build commercial products.  Notably, this is not Mizuho's first time testing a blockchain platform for the use case, as the firm recently completed a trade finance trial with several organizations.

42427822,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL3vjh,1506326403,Payment or Asset? Bitcoin's Limbo Is Leaving Merchants in the Middle,"Word that South Africa's second-largest supermarket might accept bitcoin sent twitters of excitement through the cryptocurrency community last week – that is, until it emerged that, actually, they weren't going to.  At least not yet, and probably not for a while, if ever.  In a prime example of rapid reporting, headlines proclaiming mainstream adoption (in supermarket aisles at least) jumbled up the news. Pick n Pay was testing bitcoin acceptance, not rolling it out across its network.  In an interview with BusinessDay, the chain's deputy CEO Richard van Rensburg highlighted two interesting points that paint a much bigger picture.  One is that the authorities have yet to establish a regulatory framework to manage cryptocurrency risks. This is true for most jurisdictions. Earlier this year, Japan passed a law that recognized bitcoin as a legal method of payment. Since then, several large retailers in the country have announced that they will accept (or are considering accepting) bitcoin as payment.  That doesn't mean that a significant number of people are using it as such, however.  This brings us to van Rensburg's second point: there's not a clear business case for accepting bitcoin.  Window dressing  This may seem like a small detail, but it could end up guiding the development of the bitcoin market.  Why would stores accept bitcoin? Drawbacks include rising transaction fees, erratic confirmation times and the cost of retooling.  Advantages include the ""cool factor"" and the publicity that announced tests and implementation generates. Some retailers see it as an opportunity to broaden the market. And for bitcoin believers, there's the assumption that it's a currency and therefore should be accepted.  But its usefulness as a currency is debated.  Bitcoin was originally designed for ""electronic transactions without relying on trust."" Since its inception, however, it has evolved into a different type of financial instrument. It can be used for payments and transactions, but its limitations mean that it is not practical for most purchases, and expectations of it replacing fiat have dissipated.  On the other hand, the entrance of institutional funds and small savers into the market highlights its value as an investment vehicle. Its recent performance has attracted even more investors, which further consolidates its character as an ""asset"" rather than a ""currency.""  Meanwhile, after a flurry of bitcoin activity from merchants a couple of years ago, interest has dwindled. Several large retailers accepting bitcoin report that customer engagement is minimal. And regulatory uncertainty in most jurisdictions makes stores wary of investing in the process.  Store refit  Could the tide be turning?  Interest continues to trickle in from retailers and services, including some local governments. And the ""wealth effect"" theorizes that holders, emboldened by their new riches, will be more willing spend some of their bitcoin.  However, the concerns expressed by Pick n Pay's CEO – no doubt shared by many others – are likely to act as barriers to commercial adoption around the world.  While the number of purchases with bitcoin will probably increase as the sheer volume of transactions continues to climb, the bulk of the growth will most likely come from other use cases. Part of that will come from practical applications such as cross-border transfers. Nevertheless, the recent cultural emphasis on the investment potential does point to a change in perception.  A shift in focus from bitcoin-as-a-means-of-payment to bitcoin-as-an-investment could have longer-term implications for development. Lowering transaction costs and working on sidechains would become less of a priority, enhancing security and trading venues more so.  Regulatory clarity could gather pace. The multifaceted nature of bitcoin is difficult for regulators to get their head around – a more focused approach would make it easier to draw up specific protections, which in turn could further encourage a certain type of use.  And confusion amongst the mainstream media and general public could gradually give way to an understanding that this new technology is not a threat to the established system – it can complement it, become part of it and help it to evolve.
