42384085,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NBr,1594418435,"Telegram's Defeat Isn't 'Binding' in Kik Case, Judge Tells SEC","Kik's proverbial day in court may last a lot longer than Telegram's.      That’s the takeaway from a federal judge’s response to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during a hearing in its case against messaging platform Kik over the company’s 2017 initial coin offering, which raised $100 million.      Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein, senior judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, rejected the SEC’s argument that the token sale was similar to that of Telegram, another messaging company which raised money for a blockchain project, and should face a similar outcome. The SEC won a preliminary injunction against Telegram this year, ordering the company to halt the issuance of its gram tokens, and the firm later discontinued the TON project.      “I think that there is no binding precedent one way or another,” Hellerstein said.      Nearly 200 people dialed in to listen to Thursday’s hearing, which took place just over a year after the SEC filed suit. Both the SEC and Kik have filed for summary judgment, meaning they hope to end the lawsuit before it reaches a jury trial, either by a ruling that Kik violated securities laws (the SEC’s argument) or that it didn’t (Kik’s argument). It is now up to the judge to either grant a judgment or let the trial proceed, unless the parties settle.      When SEC counsel Stephan Schlegelmilch invoked the Telegram case as a very similar token offering to Kik’s, Judge Hellerstein interrupted. He noted that Judge P. Kevin Castel, who presided over the Telegram case, only found that there was a “likelihood of success” in the preliminary injunction ruling.      “Now with you, it’s different,” he told Schlegelmilch. “You’re asking for summary judgment. I understand that Judge Castel’s decision has a lot of reasoning that is comfortable to you. [It’s a] very well-reasoned decision characteristic of Judge Castel, but I think our issue is different.”      See also: Telegram Responds to SEC: Gram Tokens Are Not Securities    Common enterprise    The hearing quickly turned into a two-hour-long debate on the application of the Howey Test, a U.S. Supreme Court case used as a precedent to determine if a financial instrument is a security.      Schlegelmilch said the case against Kik rested on a single claim: that the entirety of Kik’s offering of 1 trillion kin was an unregistered securities sale that violated Section 5 of the Securities Act. The token sale, the SEC said, was an investment contract where the investor expected to profit off the efforts of others – in this case, Kik’s promise to build an ecosystem for the use of its kin token.      “Here, the economic reality is that Kik engaged in an old-fashioned capital raise using a new-fangled device, the blockchain,” Schlegelmilch said.      Shlegelmilch went on to allege that Kik continually promised it would give the kin token value, referencing Kik’s 2017 white paper, which laid out its plans for kin. Kik allegedly told investors it would “build fundamental value for the new currency by integrating kin into its chat app,” Schlegelmilch said.      “This was a thing that had no value whatsoever. What it had was Kik’s promises to give it value. And that is a quintessential security, that is a quintessential investment contract and why this matters, Your Honor,” Schlegelmich said.      One element of Kik’s defense is similar to that of Telegram, which insisted its gram token offering for the TON project was a currency and not a security.      Despite his disagreement with the SEC over the supposed similarities with the Telegram case, Judge Hellerstein sounded unconvinced by Kik’s argument the initial coin offering (ICO) did not violate securities laws because its token, known as kin, is used as a currency by its app users.      “I can’t see the difference between that and a stock,” Judge Hellerstein said, responding to Kik’s defense that under the Howey Test the kin offering did not qualify as a common enterprise where the purchaser was led to expect profits from the efforts of the promoter or a third party.    Kik’s defense    Kik, represented by Patrick Gibbs of Cooley LLP, argued there were no contractual obligations between Kik and kin purchasers, and that if one owner sold his kin for profit, that profit is not shared with other owners.      Judge Hellerstein pushed back on that statement. Any shareholder in a given company can “sell that share at a price and keep the profit for themselves,” he said. “That’s not what determines whether there’s a common enterprise.”      Gibbs said there were a slew of cases that showed ""where the buyer has control over the resale and doesn't share profits for resale with anyone else, there is not a common enterprise,” and that the SEC had not cited cases that applied to the current situation.      “The SEC has not cited a single case, not one where the alleged profit was going to come from capital appreciation only, resale of an asset at a higher price,” Gibbs said. “They've cited to you a bunch of cases ... where the profits take the form of a share of a stream of profits or dividends that are paid out over time for an ongoing business.”      See also: A ‘Howey Test’ for Blockchain? Why the SEC’s ICO Guidance Isn’t Enough      Gibbs also reiterated Kik’s position that it could not have known at the time of sale that kin would become a security.      “One of the cases that we think lays out a very useful framework for thinking about when the sale of an asset becomes an investment contract, and therefore security, is one that cited all of our papers,"" he said, referring to Rodriguez vs. Banco Central Corporation, heard almost three decades ago, where swamp land was sold to unsuspecting investors on the alleged promise that the area was ripe for future development. The land sales were not deemed securities.      Kik General Counsel Eileen Lyon told CoinDesk the legal team presented its arguments well, and the company is awaiting the judge’s decision.      ""Judging by the numbers of people who dialed in for the hearing, this continues to be an important case for our industry,” Lyon said.",NEUTRAL,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TON | TOKEN SALE,Sandali Handagama,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/10/telegrams-defeat-isnt-binding-in-kik-case-judge-tells-sec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/877ce70c76e951c096039cf6313f138f09f9cccb-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $9,240 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET), gaining 0.25% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $9,118-$9,245  BTC below 10-day and 50-day moving average, a bearish signal for market technicians.    The market at $9,200 per bitcoin erased gains earlier in the week when the world’s oldest cryptocurrency popped to $9,400 Wednesday.“Two days ago, bitcoin rallied 1.9% then dropped 2.1% and is now flat. Just another failed breakout,” said Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading firm ExoAlpha. Still, traders buying when prices dip isn’t providing enough momentum to significantly move the market higher, Le Rest added. “There’s less and less amplitude to move, so we should see in the next couple of days how this resolves.”      Several traders pointed to $9,400, where momentum might turn into a bullish market. “The price of bitcoin again returned to the range of $9,000-$9,200 after the asset again failed to pass a key level at $9,392,” said Constatin Kogan, a partner at cryptocurrency fund BitBull Capital. Indeed, since the start of July bitcoin has struggled to break out of $9,000-$9,200 territory.      Josh Rager, a trader and adviser of crypto brokerage LevelInvest, says it will be hard to get back to Wednesday’s $9,400 price range for the time being. “I think bitcoin drops short of $9,400 to make another lower high on the trend,” he said.      However, bets in the options market overwhelmingly favor bitcoin higher than $9,200, with options on $11,250 per BTC especially popular.      Nonetheless, options volumes continued to trend down, changing the trader profile, noted Vishal Shah, founder of Alpha5. “This is only traders that play options on the high-end of the risk spectrum,” Shah said.      Read More: Exchanges See Drop in Volumes as Bitcoin Volatility Approaches 2020 Low      ExoAlpha’s Le Rest predicted a wide range where price might head into the weekend and beyond. “We're pretty neutral as it could really go both ways – up to $9,450 on way to tackle $10,000 once again, or down to $8,200,” he said.    Bitcoin locked in DeFi up 200%    The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, ether (ETH), was flat Friday, trading around $239 and in the red 0.10% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). Ether is up 84% in 2020, outperforming bitcoin’s 28% year-to-date gains.      The amount of bitcoin on DeFi, which mostly runs on the Ethereum network, has risen from 5,000 to 15,000 BTC in the past month. That is a 200% increase, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      By locking bitcoin in DeFi, investors are able to earn a reward, or “yield,” without having to trade into another asset such as ether. In July’s low spot exchange volume environment, traders might be increasingly locking crypto rather than trading it.

After restructuring the bitcoin wallet product to fit Europe’s anti-money laundering directive (AMLD5), the British startup is offering an exchange wallet with social features on Reddit, Twitter and Discord. Bottlepay co-founder Pete Cheyne said there are over 1,000 people on the waitlist for the closed beta relaunch in August.      “Because we’re moving to an app-native product there’s a lot more we can do,” Cheyne said. “We’re also adding in the ability to have scheduled payments to buy more bitcoin.”      Read more: Bitcoin App Bottle Pay Shuts Down Over Impending EU Money-Laundering Laws      Square’s Cash App and others already offer this feature in the United States, but in Europe, where Bottlepay is focused, there’s even an added feature that forwards the bitcoin to another wallet address if desired. This means users may choose custodial or non-custodial services.      “Lightning works in the background, without users having to manage channels,” Cheyne added. “There will be a small fee for exchanging between fiat and bitcoin, and vice versa. ... There will also be tiers because people are interested in our app for different use cases.”      Bottlepay CEO Mark Webster said his team of 11 employees has “constant funding” from their angel investors, who previously traded equity for $2 million in 2019. Webster added the company won’t support tokens in the near future, although it might someday. This year it is all about bitcoin.      “I think Lightning is at the core of the strategy,” Webster said, referring to the bitcoin scaling solution. “As consumer demand increases we can open more channels.”      Read more: WikiLeaks Shop Now Accepts Bitcoin Lightning Payments      As part of this shift, Webster said he is hiring, not tightening his belt for the recession, hoping to grow the team to roughly 35 people by 2021. Cheyne said several of the hires so far have been for the marketing and legal teams, which did a vast restructuring of the product. The added hassle of know-your-customer requirements also created an opportunity for wallet features.      “You can store a fiat balance,” Cheyne said. “Scan a Lightning code and pay that from your pound or euro balance.”      For now, Bottlepay will only open the beta program to users in Europe. But Webster said the company hopes to open the beta to Americans and reactivate Telegram options by 2021. When it does, it may be one of the few fiat-friendly wallets that leverages Lightning without any hassle for the user. In some ways, this is comparable to the American Lightning-powered consumer app Strike.      “This time away has been valuable for the company to refine our strategy,” Webster said. “We’re still extremely focused on Lightning.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/10/bitcoin-app-bottlepay-is-back-from-the-dead-with-a-new-lightning-app,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c27a987e917bb58756adf653071671a8493d454-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384078,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NPh,1594401083,Bitcoin Reaches Record High Correlation to S&P 500,"Bitcoin’s one-year correlation to the Standard & Poor's 500 index hit record highs as the leading cryptocurrency continues to trade in lockstep with traditional financial markets.      The realized correlation, which measures the relationship between two assets, reached 0.367 on Thursday, up from -0.06 on January 1, according to data from Coin Metrics. Bitcoin’s correlation to the benchmark index of U.S. stocks has made new all-time highs for the past three consecutive trading days. Before this, the previous high was on July 5, which lasted for one day.      It’s worth noting that a coefficient of 0.367 is not overwhelmingly strong, but correlations on shorter-term bases are significantly higher. The closer a correlation coefficient is to 1.0, the more likely two things are to move in the same direction.      Bitcoin’s one-month correlation to the S&P, for example, reached a multi-year high of 0.79 on Wednesday, according to data from Skew, indicating a much stronger short-term correlation trend as levels of investor uncertainty and expected volatility remain high. Analysts expect the trend to continue and even strengthen.      Bitcoin’s strong performance from March lows has fueled demand to buy and trade bitcoin, even with the coronavirus pandemic battering the economy.

42384081,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NXF,1594399631,Money Reimagined: COVID-19's Crash Course in Exponential Math,"If there’s one thing we can thank the coronavirus pandemic for, it’s a math lesson.      Watching an infection lead to two, then four, then eight, then 16, then 32, then 64, then 128 and so on, people found a real-world reason to comprehend the phenomenon of exponentiality. Without such context, it has been historically hard for our linear-minded brains to appreciate how rapidly network-driven growth happens. It’s a failing we’ve had for centuries. (See: the legend of the emperor who had to hand over all the rice in the land to the inventor of chess.)      You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here.      Why bring this up in a newsletter about the changing world of money?      Because the successful emergence of any new currency, which by definition implies mass adoption, depends on similar moments of exponentiality. Money requires a network effect, helped by the self-reinforcing idea that “everyone’s using it because everyone’s using it.”      As we’ve seen in the internet age of network economics, the “hockey stick growth” enjoyed by successful social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter occurs when interconnections between users – nodes in the network – reach a critical mass. That’s when the Metcalfe’s Law-fueled network effect of all those interconnections enters an exponential phase. It’s no coincidence we describe these spectacular growth stories as “viral.”      Continuing with that analogy, we could say these moments arise when a network’s “R0” – the infection reproduction rate that epidemiologists have closely watched during the COVID-19 – exceeds one.    Incentives for penguins    So, what makes a currency’s “R0” get above 1.0? It’s not easy from scratch, partly because of a countervailing barrier to expansion that economists call the “penguin problem”: people’s reluctance to join something until other people do so.      For centuries, particularly throughout the 20th century, the solution to mass currency adoption was clear: wielding the power of the state. National governments essentially mandated a network effect for their sovereign currencies, primarily by requiring taxes be paid in them and by declaring them legal tender.      Sure, every now and then a government would lose the confidence of its people and its currency would collapse. (We can think of these hyperinflation crises as exponential events in reverse, as groups of people accelerate their exit from the currency for something of more lasting value.) But in such cases the citizenry has hitherto almost always fled to another government’s currency, mostly to the U.S. dollar. Money and the sovereign have long been inseparable.      As readers of this newsletter know, a growing number of us see real challenges to this system on the horizon. Sure, the dollar is king during the pandemic, but that unbalanced global dependence, ironically, exposes the system’s weakness. Economic and geopolitical stress, combined with the opportunities posed by new digital currency and blockchain technologies, are creating the conditions for alternatives to challenge the global monetary system’s dollar-centric sovereign structure. Author David Birch calls it the coming “currency cold war.”      The combatants in this war still include governments (China is offering the Digital Currency Electronic Payments, or DCEP, system), but also corporations (Facebook and its partners in Libra) and decentralized communities such as Bitcoin’s. We can analyze each one’s prospects for “R0>1.0” viral network effects as a way to define this war’s battle lines.      To varying degrees, the different currency issuers and/or advocates must think not about how the state can or cannot compel adoption but how to best incentivize people to use their currency of their own free will. They must also think about how to overcome whatever disincentives currently exist against adoption – how to get around the penguin problem.    Ready-made network effects    It helps to start with a pre-existing network effect, whether that comes from government compulsion or some other factor.      For example, China’s international aspirations for the DCEP are built on the analog, non-digital renminbi, which is already used by more than a billion people. In a different way, Libra enjoys pre-existing network advantages as Facebook brings its user base of more than 2.6 billion people to the table.      Still, a pre-existing network for one form of crowd behavior does not assure the viability of another type of behavior.      If China is to meet its international currency adoption ambitions, it must entice foreign businesses and individuals to the DCEP. They’re not like Chinese nationals: they can freely choose not to use the People’s Bank of China’s currency. To win them over, Beijing will tout the new digital currency’s high-tech, programmable benefits, including new efficiencies in supply chain management and other business processes. It faces a big challenge convincing outsiders to ignore a strong disincentive: fear of surveillance of their transactions, especially in the wake of China’s crackdown in Hong Kong.      For Libra, too, global connections on social media are no guarantee it will hit that exponential moment. Regulators are putting constraints on Libra. And, as with China, users have deep concerns about surveillance, given Facebook’s record of exploiting personal data. While it’s the independent Libra Association, not Facebook, that governs the digital currency, it remains unclear whether that structure is sufficient to assure the public’s trust. And trust is a prerequisite for a currency’s success.    The alternative    What, then, of bitcoin and other more decentralized competitors in the currency cold war? What incentives and disincentives give cryptocurrencies a shot at viral expansion?      On the negative side, the same old disincentives to adoption persist: a lack of education, mistrust and price volatility. To offset that, cryptocurrency advocates typically point to value propositions that digital currencies such as the DCEP or Libra don’t have, including protection from the surveilling, controlling eyes of a centralized, controlling organization.      Such arguments have had mixed success. In price terms, bitcoin has gained 11 million-fold in the 10 years since the founding of Mt. Gox, the first viable trading site. But even with an estimated 50 million bitcoin wallets now open worldwide, cryptocurrency is still far from a mainstream industry.      How best to incentivize true, world-changing viral adoption, then? Should crypto platforms offer bootstrapping dividends, such as those that newcomer Compound pays in “yield farming” opportunities, dedicating some of the supply of COMP, the platform’s governance token, to reward users who engage in borrowing and lending activity? Are airdrops the way to go? Or should the crypto community just lay low and keep waiting for the centralized system’s meltdown to demonstrate cryptocurrency’s advantages by default?      Ultimately, crypto’s success depends on its utility, whether as a tool for building decentralized financial services, or as a store of scarce digital value in times of uncertainty. Demonstrate utility and the world will come.    The credit hierarchy    If digital entrepreneurs in the crypto community or elsewhere are to build a new payment architecture, they must first see what the existing landscape looks like. For the U.S. picture, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s nationwide annual survey of consumer payments habits is a useful starting point. In providing a snapshot of how Americans pay for things, the report indirectly shows how our financial system defines a social hierarchy – from an “unbanked” underclass, to the “underbanked” working and middle class, to the credit-rich upper-middle and upper class. One problem with the Atlanta Fed’s survey, especially with this year’s recently released report, is that it comes out six months after the end of the survey year. The latest results capture nothing of the impact from COVID-19, which would have significantly reduced cash usage due to people’s concerns about banknote-transmitted disease and have increased online payments among the now working-from-home U.S. population. Nonetheless, the report reveals interesting long-term trends in different payment methods:      The past two years’ drop in cash usage, which now accounts for a lesser share of payments than credit cards, is important. The slide in checks usage is not surprising – along with the countervailing increase in bank account routing number payments (BANP) – but the very fact they’re used at all is noteworthy, given that consumer check payments have gone the way of the dinosaurs elsewhere. What’s most telling, I think, is the split among card payments, which have replaced cash: debit cards continue their dominance over credit cards and prepaid cards are picking up modest gains. This tells me that while a minority of Americans, including undocumented immigrants, remain unbanked and therefore dependent on cash or prepaid cards, a large number are underbanked. It suggests it is hard for people to maintain credit scores that would otherwise let them live their lives on a credit card.      Debit cards are a second-class way to pay for things. (Think of the deposit, sometimes as high as $1,000, that car rental companies require if you commit to pay with a debit instead of a credit card.) They provide the convenience of not having to carry cash around, but that’s all. Debit cards do not give their holders the lifestyle flexibility afforded to credit card holders, who can leverage the implicit backing of a financial institution that’s willing to make payments on their behalf. It speaks to how exclusion from, first, banking and, second, credit lines, imposes a burdensome “tax” on lower-income people and contributes to the United States’ ever-widening wealth disparity.      I hate to say it, but Bitcoin alone does NOT fix this. We must also lower barriers to credit, which means lowering the repayment risks that lenders perceive in servicing low- and middle-income people. Does DeFi fix that? Too early to say.

The Digital Dollar Project of former Commodity Futures and Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo got a solid endorsement from Karen Petrou, one of the most trusted analysts of federal finance policy. In her “Economic Equality” blog, a must-read chronicle of how finance impacts the kind of disparities described in the prior item, she first skewers the more centralized version of a central bank digital currency – the kind contained in China’s DCEP. She worries about financial inclusion. Whereas CBDC advocates tout the model as a way to “bank the unbanked,” Petrou argues it will hurt the poor. She offers two reasons: 1) The “digital divide” means the poor don’t have access to the online tools they’ll need, and 2) the centralized surveillance of transactions will be used in a discriminatory way against low-income users. She also worries the transfer of bank deposits to Federal Reserve-based CBDC accounts would undermine the autonomy of banks to offer credit, creating incentives for the politicization of the central bank as an arbiter of lending in the economy. The solution, she says, is an “open-source CBDC,” a more decentralized model in which banks and, potentially, tech companies would be approved to create reserve-backed tokens that track the value of the actual currency. In doing so, she explicitly cited Giancarlo’s June congressional testimony about the Digital Dollar Project’s tokenized model.      DEPPOR. The world of banking and credit depends on the core concept of benchmark interest rates. Without a benchmark against which to price rates and devise a proxy for measuring risk, it’s difficult for lenders to put a price on how much to charge borrowers. One of the world’s most important benchmarks is Libor, the London Interbank Overnight Rate, which measures the daily rates at which banks holding short-term surplus cash lend it to others with short-term shortages. The thing is, Libor is deeply broken. Corruption among Libor traders, who were found to have colluded to set the rate to their advantage in a major 2014 scandal, is a known risk. But little has been done to resolve a core problem the crypto community understands well: a centralized architecture that requires users to trust these entities. It’s one reason supporters of the American Financial Exchange’s new Ameribor project, which uses a permissioned version of Ethereum as an audit trail for banks’ submissions to the rate-setting process, were excited about a quasi-endorsement from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. But while that’s an innovative model and may boost trust in the system, it still leaves banks in the middle of the process.      So, it’s worth asking what a more decentralized finance model for rate benchmarking would look like. And on that, I was struck by a recent column by CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors, who took a DeFi lens to the rates industry. Looking at the business of yield farming, where people find interesting ways to leverage their idle crypto holdings by lending them out, Demirors exposed some parallels with the interbank lending market, where banks essentially use their surplus holdings of either cash or securities to extract value from other banks that need to borrow them for short-term needs. In a similar way, benchmark rates emerge from this short-term borrowing and lending process, though in this case across multiple assets. The really big difference is that you don’t need to be a bank to participate in a DeFi rate-setting market. DeFi has its own manipulation problems, of course, not least because of the risk that bigger crypto “whales” – the equivalent of the big Libor banks – can use their excessive holdings of the DeFi governance tokens such as COMP and MKR to skew rates in their favor. Maybe we need regulators to get involved, but a DeFi rate-setting model is certainly something to chew on. We just need an acronym to get started. How about DEEPOR – the Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Overnight Rate?      DOGE DEUX. Very wow.Obviously, they were made for each other: Dogecoin and TikTok. The incredible 1900% runup in the price of dogecoin this past week, all driven by a viral meme on the video-sharing app challenging people to get the previously dormant cryptocurrency’s price to $1, was reminiscent of dogecoin’s first hype-driven entry into public consciousness. In 2014, a vibrant community of meme and crypto enthusiasts successfully raised 67.8 million dogecoins (around $55,000 at the time) to sponsor ex-NASCAR driver Josh Wise’s car. That stunt and others helped drive the value of the coin, created for a lark by developer Jackson Palmer, to what was once sixth position in crypto market cap rankings. That’s why the return this week of another meme-infused dogecoin rally seemed so relevant.      Naturally, the price surge provoked hand-wringing about irrational investors and scammers creating bubbles. But somehow this whole thing goes beyond that. It has the feel of a collective art project. There’s no pretense about dogecoin actually being worth anything. It’s all about a community effort to make something happen. Now, those who started the mania will make out like bandits if they dump the coin at the top. But if everyone is on the game, are they actually bandits? We live in strange times.      Nathaniel Whittemore’s take on this – “Why TikTok Doge Is Everything About 2020 Finance in One Story” – for his CoinDesk Podcast Network show, The Breakdown, was excellent, by the way.      DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO. Nikhilesh De’s piece on all the crypto companies that received COVID-19 relief loans under the U.S. government’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small business prompted some tut-tutting on Crypto Twitter. All these entities promoting non-government money, now panhandling from Uncle Sam. How dare they! It’s a simplistic argument. If a loan program comes along that contains generous forgiveness terms for maintaining payrolls during an economic crisis, you could argue it would be unfair to your staff not to take up the offer. Also, many in the crypto business community long ago conceded to the reality of government power – just look at how many obtained money transmitter licenses and now proudly tout how compliant they are with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. Surely in the midst of a serious economic crisis, they’re now entitled to get some help in return. But I feel a little differently about PPP loans going to more mainstream conservative entities whose sole reason for being is to lobby against government largesse – organizations like the Ayn Rand Institute or outspoken fiscal hawk Grover Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform. In a tweet, CNBC’s Kayla Tausche pointed out that Norquist’s outfit, immediately after receiving $350,000 in fiscal relief, put its signature to a letter declaring that government spending “is inhibiting the fast recovery we want in jobs and incomes, not stimulating it.” Okaaaaaay.

42384069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NI9,1594399372,"Bitcoin Wallet Electrum Now Supports Lightning, Watchtowers and Submarine Swaps","One of the most popular Bitcoin wallets, Electrum, now supports Lightning Network payments.      The latest swathe of major changes was released in version 4.0, one of its biggest upgrades since the Bitcoin wallet launched in 2011. (Note: Since the 4.0 release, some bug fixes have been added.) Lightning payments are seen as the future of Bitcoin because they're cheaper and would allow many more users to make bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions at once.      This makes Electrum the oldest wallet to have adopted Lightning payments so far.      Lightning support in Electrum is a long time coming. Electrum founder Thomas Voegtlin first told CoinDesk last summer that Lightning would make it into the next release.      ""[We] decided to adopt Lightning because we see it as the way forward for Bitcoin. Lightning is quite complicated and not without its issues but ultimately it is the most promising currently known way of scaling Bitcoin. It also allows fast, cheap and more private payments,"" pseudonymous Electrum developer SomberNight told CoinDesk in an email.      Read more: What is Bitcoin's Lightning Network?      In order to support Lightning transactions, the developers actually wrote an entirely new implementation of the Lightning protocol ""from scratch,"" SomberNight said, instead of using a popular implementation, such as Lightning Labs' LND or Blockstream's c-lightning. That's one reason the release took so long.    An Electrum watchtower    In addition to support for Lightning payments, Electrum 4.0.2 now supports a number of other innovations with this new release that could make using Lightning more secure and less bumpy for users.      For one, Electrum has implemented its own Lightning watchtower, an important component of the Lightning Network, which scans the Bitcoin blockchain in order to detect and prevent fraud.      Read more: Bitcoin Lightning Fraud? Laolu Is Building a 'Watchtower' to Fight It      Though there are a few watchtower implementations out there now, they still aren't commonly used yet across the Lightning Network, despite being an important piece. In this way, Electrum's watchtower support is a step toward a better Lightning Network.    Submarine swaps    Then, there are ""submarine swaps."" Accepting payments is still a tricky part of the Lightning Network because users need what's called ""incoming capacity"" to receive payments, which means funds need to be placed in a certain part of a person's Lightning ""channel,"" which is sort of like an account .      The irony is users ""will not be able to receive payments until they spend some money,"" as SomberNight put it.      ""To solve this, we implemented 'submarine swaps,’ which are atomic exchanges of on-chain and Lightning bitcoins,"" SomberNight told CoinDesk. In other words, submarine swaps makes it possible to send normal bitcoin to a Lightning channel, offering one way for users to fill up their incoming capacity.      ""Electrum Technologies runs a central server that facilitates these swaps, for a fee. This allows users to buy incoming capacity to be able to receive Lightning payments,"" the developer added.    Hardware support for Lightning    Electrum also integrated Lightning with hardware support. Because hardware wallets store bitcoin offline beyond the reach of hackers they are considered one of the best ways of securing bitcoin.      ""You can [now] use Lightning directly with your hardware wallet: Channel-opens and channel-closes can directly pay from and to addresses backed by a hardware device. Your Lightning balance, while in channels, will not be secured by the hardware but all your on-chain balance will be, and it's very convenient to have a shared single wallet that you can use to pay both on-chain and Lightning,"" SomberNight told CoinDesk.      The Electrum team has been working on other features too.

Employment Kerfuffle Former Tron Foundation employees are challenging a court order allowing the foundation to settle a lawsuit through arbitration, rather than in court. The initial complaint centers around allegations of wrongful termination and hostile work practices at BitTorrent, a file-sharing service acquired by the Tron Foundation.      Appeal Denied Bitfinex will have to face allegations from New York State prosecutors that it lost $850 million in client and corporate funds and tried to cover this hole with funds from the affiliated tether stablecoin, according to a ruling by the State Supreme Court’s Appellate Division on Thursday. The exchange’s parent iFinex initially claimed the prosecutors didn’t have jurisdiction over the Hong Kong-headquartered firm, which the appeals court rejected. The court also dismissed the argument that tether was neither a commodity nor a security.

Venezuela is often a proving ground for do-gooding crypto companies and protocols. Payments network Dash, for one, famously made headway in the nation beset by hyperinflation.      AirTM distributed approximately $300,000 worth of crypto to Venezuelans, and while only 57% of recipients engaged with the funds, many were able to successfully use the donations to buy food and medicines. Others began treating the AirTM platform as a personal bank.      The bigger picture is coming into focus: Crypto only becomes a viable alternative to traditional financial systems if there is robust infrastructure to support it. “If Venezuela offers an example of bitcoin usage, then it appears there is user demand for bitcoin-friendly services provided by a regular fintech company,” CoinDesk’s Leigh Cuen reports.    Market intel    Balance Sheet Contractions. Bullish for Bitcoin? As the U.S. Federal Reserve begins to unwind its balance sheet, contracting $88 billion to $6.97 trillion (-1.5%) in the week ending July 8, some crypto observers are saying this could have negative consequences for bitcoin’s price. That’s because in recent months bitcoin has been positively correlated with traditional assets, which have rallied on the back of the Fed’s balance sheet expansion. But that’s far from the consensus view. “Zooming into the details of the Fed’s balance sheet reveals the reduction has been primarily driven by a drop in demand for emergency liquidity measures, a sign the coronavirus-induced stress in the financial system has eased,” CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole writes.    Opinion    Blockchain Credentials, Not Credentialism Blockchain certification can verify expertise and experience, making transferring schools and changing jobs easier. But certificate proliferation may be a bigger problem, argues Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist and founding economist at Prysm Group. “Non-degree credentials, such as badges and certificates, in particular are rapidly multiplying because they can now be digitally transmitted and verified at a minimal cost,” she writes.

42384065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0ND7,1594393187,Cardano Creator Compares Criticism of Project to 'Trump Derangement Syndrome',"In his most recent video, Charles Hoskinson frets that massive egos and bitter conflicts threaten to undermine the cryptocurrency community. But, with a touch of Trumpian hyperbole, he suggests that journalists and rivals are trying to keep his project down.      ""Are we being too overzealous with Cardano?"" the IOHK CEO mulls at the start of the YouTube talk.      He's in a cluttered home study. Tribal masks leer down from the walls and a six-foot reprint of Jean-Leon Gerome's ""Pollice Verso"" with its vanquishing gladiator hangs to the left.      Hoskinson leans forward on his desk, folding his arms: ""Let's be honest, as a community we've been really treated unfairly, we've been [urinated] on, [defecated] on, 'scam, scam, scam, scam, no working product' ... everything that could be said, has been said.""      ""In particular, crypto media has got it wrong a lot,"" he says, looking directly at the camera.      For the past year, the chief of IOHK, the developer house for blockchain platform Cardano, has used YouTube extensively to communicate directly to his followers. Sometimes these videos are basic protocol updates or ""ask me anything"" sessions (AMAs). Other times it's to hit back at perceived criticism.      This week's animus surrounds a video that made the rounds on social media last week, which showed a marketing group promoting the Cardano project in a rural province of China. Both the Cardano project and Hoskinson said they have no affiliation with the group.    Shelley-shocked    Similarly, Hoskinson talks about an article from industry news site Crypto Briefing that argued the upcoming launch of staking protocol Shelley would not suffice to give Cardano the edge it needs over rival blockchain platforms such as TRON or EOS.      Following the article's publication, he took to Twitter to call Crypto Briefing a ""dumpster fire of a publication.""      See also: Cardano Developer IOHK Launches $20M Fund for Ecosystem Startups      In this video, Hoskinson's head sways as he speaks, eyes still fixed on the camera. Journalists, podcasters and other influential figures, he says, have taken a definitive hard stance against Cardano; many of them won't retract what they've said because they're concerned about losing credibility with their audiences.      ""You know, this is where Trump derangement syndrome came from,"" Hoskinson says, pensively stroking his beard. The U.S. president is a ""horrible human being ... but everyone kinda just wrote him off and then, when he won, everyone went a little crazy about that and said we have to remediate this grievous mistake.""      Hoskinson goes on: ""Well, similarly there is a bit of a Cardano derangement syndrome in the cryptocurrency space. People said our ideas will never work, we'll never deliver, we'll never actually ship anything, we've never actually accomplished anything. They just sometimes misrepresent reality completely.""      The tempo rises. Cardano's been going for five years, he says. The critics have ignored everything the project has accomplished and a complex of rival project leads and media entities – he doesn't specify who – have never ceased calling it a scam or a fraud.    Close to home    Hoskinson's brows knit. The criticism is personal: ""How would you feel if someone came up to you and said: 'so when did you stop beating your wife? When did you stop being a child molester?'""      See also: Coinbase Custody to Support Secure Cardano Staking This Year      Still, he concedes, the digital asset industry has a serious problem with over-inflated egos and a lack of respect towards others. If this isn't addressed soon, he warns, then the Amazons and the Googles will swoop in and co-opt crypto for themselves.      In the spirit of reconciliation, he says Cardano will try harder to connect with other projects. Possibly even build some sort of cross-chain operability with Litecoin. ""It'll be fun project – they think about it, we think about it, why not?""      But that doesn't mean Hoskinson will ever stop speaking out publicly, especially when he feels ""my community"" is being attacked.      ""Every now and then I'm going to kick people in the teeth on Twitter, it's my style, I'm Italian, my grandmother's Italian. It's who I am, it's where I come from, it's how I think,"" he says.      ""I'll never apologize for kicking people in the teeth that call my community bad.""      Talking to CoinDesk about the use of such strong rhetoric, Hoskinson said, while he may have said and done things that are ""counter-productive or regrettable,"" these came from the strain of ""operating in a low empathy medium where people don't even attempt to understand each other.""      Plus, what he considered unfair media coverage over the years, ""does create a bit of bitterness and disappointment.""      In the end, Hoskinson said, ""You should never forget that these ecosystems aren't just protocols. They are people.""

42384079,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NUj,1594387306,First Mover: Kyber Token's Eightfold Increase Reveals Bet on Future Market-Share Growth,"In cryptocurrency markets, newfangled “decentralized exchanges” like Kyber are piddling compared with more-established and centralized venues like Binance.      But in the eyes of traders, it’s the upstarts who are winning lately – at least based on the year-to-date performance of digital tokens affiliated with the various exchanges.      Take Kyber Network Crystal (KNC), which is used to pay trading fees on the decentralized exchange Kyber. The token’s price has surged eight-fold in 2020. That compares with a 21% gain for Binance Coin (BNB), which customers of the exchange can use to pay trading fees, at a discounted rate.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Part of the performance gap is due to the fast growth in usage of Kyber, one of the biggest players in the white-hot arena of decentralized finance, or DeFi. Daily transactions on the Kyber network so far in July are averaging more than double their June level, according to CryptoCompare.      The price moves are also driven by speculation over future growth, and cryptocurrency traders are betting that decentralized exchanges could gain market share over time. In the meantime analysts are crunching the numbers and realizing that the KNC tokens might provide more ongoing yield than the Binance coins.      BNB is often categorized by crypto-market taxonomists as a utility token, whereas KNC is often lumped in with other DeFi coins.      But Michael Gord, CEO of Toronto-based trading firm Global Digital Assets, says he looks at them side by side, as rivals in the exchange business.      “Kyber is actually competitive to exchanges like Binance,” Gord said in a phone interview.      Just this week, Kyber announced a protocol upgrade known as Katalyst that will allow KNC holders to earn so-called staking rewards – essentially like earning interest denominated in more of the same tokens – starting in a few weeks.      Those staking rewards will come from a cut of the trading fees borne by users of the decentralized exchange. At the current rate, the platform charges trading fees of 0.20%, some 65% of which go directly to stakers. But KNC holders also can vote to change the fee rates and payout mix.      Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Kyber are trading platforms constructed atop the Ethereum blockchain, with built-in programming known as “smart contracts” that allow trading to take place without a middleman to hold funds and match orders. Binance, by contrast, has embraced the middleman role since it was set up in 2017 (though it also launched a DEX in 2019).      Here’s where the centralized exchanges are winning: first-mover advantage, reflected in their dominant share of trading volumes. According to the data aggregator Dune Analytics, decentralized exchanges are averaging a combined daily volume of about $60 million in July. And Binance alone, according to CoinGecko, has $2.1 billion in volume per day.      “DEXs are a great development within the digital-asset ecosystem to trade crypto to crypto,” David Lifchitz, chief investment officer for the Paris-based trading firm ExoAlpha, told First Mover in an email message. “But it’s not a scalable infrastructure, with the current trading volume, for an active trader.”      Jake Brukhman, managing director at token asset manager CoinFund, said that because DEX volumes are low, there’s “slippage,” the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it’s actually executed.      “While I can exchange an asset instantly, I might actually pay a lot of slippage to do that,” Brukhman told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Comparing the economics of the tokens requires some work. Kyber’s KNC token gives holders a return, or “yield” for providing liquidity, or “staking” by sending crypto to the KyberDAO smart contract.      Binance, in addition to providing discounts for fees paid in BNB tokens, occasionally “burns” some of the tokens or eliminates them from the outstanding supply, offering an additional reward in the form of anti-dilution.      Gord acknowledges Kyber’s network liquidity is still pretty paltry compared with Binance, and that makes it a non-starter for large trading volumes. But he sees the price jump in the KNC tokens as a bet that decentralized exchanges will continue to grow.      “Once Kyber has much deeper liquidity it would impact our trading business more,” he said.    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $9,192 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $9,441 | 24-Hr Low: $9,133      Trend: Bitcoin fell below $9,150 early Friday, reversing most of the gain from $9,060 to $9,480 seen in the first half of the week.      The pullback has invalidated the bullish view put forward by Wednesday’s upside break of a falling channel represented by trendlines connecting June 1 and 22 highs and June 2 and 15 lows.      Essentially, it's a case of failed breakout, which chart analysts consider a powerful bearish signal. In addition, the 3% decline seen in the past 24 hours has established another bearish lower high on the daily chart, as noted by popular analyst Josh Rager.      Even so, it is still too early to say the bears have regained control because the cryptocurrency is holding above $9,000. Sellers have failed multiple times in the last four weeks to establish a strong foothold below that psychological support.      As such, the immediate outlook would remain neutral as long as prices are trapped in the range of $9,000 and $9,480 (Wednesday’s high). Acceptance under $9,000 may prove costly – so much so that the cryptocurrency may end up falling to $7,100, according to crypto market analyst Josh Olszewicz.      Meanwhile, a move above $9,480 would put the focus on the psychological hurdle of $10,000 once more. Option traders are betting on a bullish breakout, as discussed Thursday.

42384073,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NNB,1594386000,"Blockchain Tech Can Verify Credentials, but Beware Credentialism","Stephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard.      As the world prepares to return to work and school following the coronavirus crisis, the essential role that credentials play in the labor market is coming into view. Millions of workers who permanently lost jobs and thousands of students attending colleges that may close forever will be in search of new opportunities. And they will rely on credentials to attest to their skills and experience.      Credentials can be almost anything: degrees, diplomas, certificates, licenses and so on. What they have in common is that a known third-party issues them, and they indicate the credential holder has specific qualifications or authorizations. This can include passing a test, earning a degree, completing a project or program or having been accepted as a member of a profession.      See also: Christopher Allen - The Path to Self-Sovereign Identity      People acquire credentials because they believe the credentials will improve their job or school opportunities. For a credential to be effective in doing so, it must meet three criteria. First, some set of decision-makers (schools, employers, etc.) understand the skills or experiences the credential represents. Second, the information conveyed by the credential causes these decision-makers to offer a better job, admission to a program, more money, an interview instead of a rejection and so forth. Third, the decision-makers should be able to verify the credential is legitimate.      If you’re here on CoinDesk, you may already see where blockchain adds immediate value to credentials: verification. Many credentials still require painful and time-consuming processes to certify their authenticity, such as calling colleges and universities on the phone, tracking down former employers or waiting for embossed paper copies to arrive in the mail. Former students of defunct colleges rely on an ad-hoc network of third-party clearinghouses, state school boards, law firms and other universities to validate their degrees.      With blockchain, there is no need for the intermediary. The credential holder shares an electronic record with whomever they want, and the recipient uses software to verify that it’s legitimate. A distributed ledger reduces the risk that records will suddenly disappear because the database custodian goes out of business. Cryptographic solutions like zero-knowledge proofs can enable credential holders to specify which documents to reveal to whom.      Blockchain creates unambiguous value for employees and students: it can decrease the cost of verification, reduce administrative delays, prevent fraud and make applying for jobs and additional schooling that much easier.    There is a significant need to make transferring schools and changing jobs as seamless as possible.    But the introduction of blockchain-based credentials also allows a dangerous temptation: credential proliferation.      Non-degree credentials, such as badges and certificates, in particular are rapidly multiplying because they can now be digitally transmitted and verified at a minimal cost. For example, Central New Mexico Community College introduced blockchain-based micro-credentials in eight “21st Century Skills,” including initiative and empathy.      The United States labor market is in a disastrous state, and the impulse to go all-in creating new credentials that might help displaced students and workers is understandable. However, introducing an avalanche of new badges and certificates may perversely result in credential providers destroying their own business.      Consider the rise and deflation of coding bootcamps. Introduced in the early 2010s, coding bootcamps promised to help remedy the shortage of coders through intensive, three- to six-month training programs. And many did. App Academy, General Assembly and Hack Reactor provided quality instruction, complimentary resume coaching and job search support.      Because of these early successes, the number of bootcamps exploded. But many of these new entrants were low quality, riding on the coattails of the pioneers, and soon skepticism grew about the quality of training these programs provided. Employers, unsure which bootcamps were good or bad, sometimes refused to hire graduates of bootcamps at all.      See also: COVID-19 ‘Immunity Passport’ Unites 60 Firms on Self-Sovereign ID Project      Similar pitfalls await those who plunge too quickly into inventing and issuing a large number of blockchain-based credentials. Studies of the value of credentials show the economic benefit varies widely. Often employers are unaware of which non-standard credentials are available, how they are relevant to the workplace and why they would be useful for hiring. Bombarding employers with credentials that they aren’t familiar with and don’t understand is most likely to result in the lot being summarily ignored.      Even more concerning, allowing credential proliferation opens the door for predatory practices similar to those conducted by for-profit colleges and universities.      Despite the risks of credential proliferation, I am hopeful about the potential value of blockchain-based credentials. There is a significant need to make transferring schools and changing jobs as seamless as possible.      However, to maintain credibility, blockchain-based credential providers will need to make some careful economic choices. Here are three recommendations:    Focus first on credential verification    Jumping straight from introducing blockchain to creating new credentials misunderstands the value that blockchain provides. Blockchain itself does little to help decision-makers understand what a credential signifies or manage how that information is used in hiring and admissions. Using a blockchain doesn’t reduce the need for the long, involved advocacy process, undertaken by Opportunity@Work and other organizations, of working with employers to expand the set of credentials that are valued in the hiring process.      In contrast, enabling verification of existing, high-value credentials such as bachelor’s degrees and legally required licenses provides value almost immediately, as high-value credentials are the most likely to be falsified. The process of creating new credentials can then proceed slowly, taking advantage of emerging data to establish new credentials’ value and communicate this in a sustainable way to employers.    Regulation is not the enemy    The coding bootcamp industry, facing the significant reputational damage discussed previously, voluntarily embraced regulation. A consortium of bootcamps pledged to regularly report standardized data of their graduation and job placement outcomes. General Assembly, an industry leader, publicly spoke about how oversight by the State of California improved its operations.      See also: Lex Sokolin - DeFi Protocols Should Act More Like Fiduciaries      Blockchain-based credentialing services face similar systemic risks, and thus may also need to embrace regulation strategically. A credential provider that falsifies data in exchange for bribes, or provides misleading information about the value of credentials, will damage the reputation of the industry as a whole. Establishing industry-wide best practices can lessen the impact of these bad actors and improve the prospects of the industry as a whole.    Embrace the opportunity to create social good    Simplicity and usability need to be a priority in product design. The mental and physical stresses on those who have lost jobs or had to leave school due to the coronavirus are significant. According to research by the Hope Center for College, Community and Justice at Temple University, more than 10% of college students have experienced homelessness during the COVID pandemic and approximately 40% have experienced food insecurity. The last thing anyone wants to do when navigating the current economy is to keep track of public-private keys.      Monetization strategy also needs to take a long-term view. The organizations and individuals that will need the most help managing credentials – bankrupt schools, individuals let go from jobs, businesses closing – will have least money to spend on new technologies. Being creative with funding, delaying the requirement for profit, and investing in partnerships can provide genuine social good while setting the stage for network growth.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Stephanie Hurder,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/10/blockchain-tech-can-verify-credentials-but-beware-credentialism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e064fe1e8412fd25d828ae517d808763882a71f3-2400x1665.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384077,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NTT,1594382780,The Federal Reserve's Declining Balance Sheet Is Bearish for Bitcoin. Or Is It?,"The U.S. Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is contracting, but despite popular opinion that's not necessarily bad news for bitcoin.      The central bank’s balance sheet declined by $88 billion to $6.97 trillion (-1.5%) in the week ending July 8, having hit a record high of $7.16 trillion in early June, according to the data source Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The decline is the largest in 11 years.      The drop is a sign of the Fed starting to unwind the liquidity-boosting measures rolled out over the past four months to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus crisis. Some have anticipated a pullback in bitcoin prices as a result.      That's because the leading cryptocurrency by market value has recently developed a relatively strong positive correlation with the S&P 500. And Wall Street’s equity index has rallied by over 40% since a slump in March, largely on the back of Fed’s balance sheet expansion.      Also read: Bitcoin’s Price Correlation With S&P 500 Hits Record Highs      As such, a contracting balance sheet could portend a pullback in stocks, and perhaps bitcoin.      However, zooming into the details of the Fed’s balance sheet reveals the reduction has been primarily driven by a drop in demand for emergency liquidity measures, a sign the coronavirus-induced stress in the financial system has eased.      ""Less emergency funding being used is a healthy sign,"" said Richard Rosenblum, co-founder of GSR. ""Markets might not be able to stand completely on their own two feet, but they are at least a bit further from code red emergency mode.""    Goldilocks scenario?    Notably, dollar swap lines – reciprocal agreements between central banks to keep currency available for their commercial banks – have fallen by over $40 billion, as noted by Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy.      The Fed opened dollar swap lines with other central banks after the coronavirus crash caused a dollar shortage in the international markets. Therefore, the latest decline in the dollar swap lines could be considered good news.      Meanwhile, the balance of outstanding repurchase agreements, or repos, slipped to zero from $61.2 billion seen in the week ended July 1. Repos are a source of short-term funding for commercial banks. The Fed began injecting liquidity in the repo market in mid-September 2019 and ramped up the effort following the market crisis in March.      As such, the decline in repos to zero indicates that the coronavirus-induced stress in the funding markets has eased significantly.      However, the Fed is still injecting liquidity into the U.S. economy via purchases of U.S. treasuries at a faster pace. The central bank accumulated treasuries worth $18 billion during the past week, pushing the overall bond holdings to a new high of $4.23 trillion.      All in all, the Fed’s balance sheet contraction and drop in repos and swap lines appear indicative of a Goldilocks scenario for equities, given the ongoing crisis at least, and seems unlikely to pose a threat to bitcoin's price.      The cryptocurrency would still face stronger selling pressure if stocks once more collapse on adverse coronavirus news. But the market is still showing resilience with a measured drop, even though U.S. registered 65,551 new coronavirus cases on Thursday, a new daily record, according to John Hopkins University.      At press time, futures tied to the S&P 500 are reporting a 0.33% decline, while bitcoin is changing hands near $9,170, having faced rejection above $9,400 on Thursday.

The truth on the ground is much more nuanced.      The fintech startup AirTM distributed roughly $300,000 worth of cryptocurrency donations to 60,829 ID-verified Venezuelan e-wallets throughout 2019. The donated crypto came from entities like GiveCrypto, the Electric Coin Company and the artist Cryptograffiti.      “To incentivize donations, the largest donor did receive a piece of the mural,” Cryptograffiti told CoinDesk, describing the crowdfunded mural project.      Read more: Bolivars to Bitcoin: Activists Take Down Venezuela’s Maduro in Crypto Art Exhibit      The muralist’s crowdfunding campaign made up the bulk of bitcoin (BTC) donations, which in total represented less than 12% of funds donated to AirTM’s Venezuelan users. The bulk of donations were assets such as bitcoin cash (BCH), zcash (ZEC) and dai (DAI) and amounted to roughly $5 per donation. AirTM’s data shows few users chose to withdraw the crypto donations, opting instead to keep it inside the AirTM system.      According to an AirTM user survey, only 57% of recipients engaged with the funds. For some, even converting crypto to AirTM credits (AirUSD) inside a custodial user account was too much hassle.      For those who did access the funds, more than 2,000 Venezuelans said it was helpful for buying food. (You can see the full survey results here.) They typically did this by using AirTM to cash out bolivars as needed, using the digital wallet provider like a bank. Others used it as savings.      “So far I only use this crypto in AirTM,” one such user, Neysa Hurtado, said in an interview.      Read more: Crypto Exchange AirTM Targets Troubled Markets With $7 Million Raise      Even bitcoiners like freelance engineer Geraldo Meneses, who does hold a small amount of crypto in his own wallet, preferred to use most of the donated crypto as AirTM credits.      “Bitcoin is a way to charge for my work,” Meneses said via WhatsApp. “AirTM is my exchange platform and personal bank.”    Future banks    Meneses said he used the extra bitcoin from this charity campaign to buy medicine for his mother, which was expensive and had to be shipped from abroad.      Before the coronavirus crisis, he said it was possible to ship medicine from Europe within roughly two weeks, but now it can take up to a month. So having the capital to order in advance is important.      “Many people are looking for ways to exchange dollars and cryptocurrencies,” he said. “The most cunning [exchangers] try to defraud innocent people.”      This was the benefit AirTM offered. Customers trusted the platform and knew how to use it, although few know how to operate zcash or bitcoin wallets. One new AirTM user, attorney Michael Barráez, said this was his first time learning about cryptocurrency. He said he might buy some bitcoin to hold for himself, as savings.      Read more: Brazil’s Ailing Economy Is Helping Dollar-Pegged Stablecoins Find Traction      “When democracy is back and the U.S. sanctions are over, our economy will flourish again,” Barráez said.      Even if users have the skills to use cryptocurrency, some of them still prefer to manage most of their money with the option for recourse that a company provides. Others don’t want to hold a highly volatile asset at all.      “I could see that the money [AirUSD] did not devalue,” first-time crypto user Jannet García de Rivas, an experienced engineer who works in the tech industry, said about why he converted the crypto donation.    Bottom line    If Venezuela offers an example of bitcoin usage, then it appears there is user demand for bitcoin-friendly services provided by a regular fintech company.      In short, people trust the service provider, even if they may occasionally choose to hold a small amount of bitcoin themselves. The service provider makes it easier for them to transact with bitcoin across borders or liquidate it. Other users, with specific needs, require lots of planning and preparation in order to use bitcoin directly and be their own proverbial banker.      “There is still so much work to be done in order to have bitcoin adoption in the region,” Cryptograffiti said. “For example, we had a random selection of refugees participate who just happened to be in the area, many of whom didn’t even have email addresses. In order to be the most effective, we could have tried to target a particular subset ahead of time.”",NEUTRAL,BCH | ZEC | DAI,BCH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | ZEC | DAI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/10/a-rare-glimpse-into-how-crypto-is-really-used-in-venezuela,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/09e545dd651a61747905309ea8d58563408e3a39-1500x845.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384066,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0NEN,1594368838,Ethereum and EOSIO Square Up Over Enterprise Blockchain Business in Latin America,"There may be an enterprise blockchain arms race brewing in Latin America.      LatamLink, an alliance of three organizations involved in the launch of the EOS public blockchain in 2018, is now busy integrating the EOSIO software for enterprise uses. The group seems to be competing for business in the region with ConsenSys, a globally distributed outfit focused on all things Ethereum.      Up for grabs is LACChain, a blockchain framework that has the backing of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and a host of public and private entities across Latin America and the Caribbean.      ConsenSys set up a Besu testnet for LACChain early last year, to create infrastructure that is both public and permissioned, where necessary, to accommodate digital identity and tokenized fiat money. It’s meant to enable use cases in government procurement, land registry programs, social impact projects and so on.      Read more: CoinDesk 50: Besu, the Marriage of Ethereum and Hyperledger      The Latin American EOS contingent is a voluntary alliance put together by EOS Costa Rica, with EOS Argentina and EOS Venezuela as founding members. All three organizations have experience running EOSIO infrastructure and were genesis block producers during the EOS mainnet launch, for which EOSIO creator Block.one raised over $4 billion in a protracted token sale.      Now EOS Costa Rica is set to unveil a testnet for LACChain, setting off a blockchain beauty contest of sorts between the two technology tribes – one that may ultimately lead to the beginnings of EOSIO-Ethereum interoperability.      The choice is LACChain’s.      “They [LACChain] can see if there is interoperability between the protocols, or choose one over the other,” said EOS Costa Rica co-founder Edgar Fernández. “You can see them side by side.”    ‘Not a competition’    For his part, Fernández said it’s not going to be a “winner takes all” battle to see which will be the preferred mainnet option. Certain apps or use cases may be better suited to Ethereum; others might work best on EOSIO.      Something both sides agree on, though: The project could be a big deal.      “If LACChain becomes the gold standard, given the IDB’s deep relationships with governments, the private sector and international organizations, ConsenSys technology has the potential to serve billions of people across the world,” ConsenSys spokesperson Kara Miley told CoinDesk via email.      ConsenSys added that it had not yet entered into any discussions about interoperability with EOSIO in the context of LACChain.      Read more: Inter-American Development Bank to Pilot Land Registries on Blockchain      LACChain tech lead Marcos Allende was at pains to point out the project was set up to be “tech agnostic” and is not a competition or a race between protocols.      “We are not launching the EOSIO network because there is anything wrong with Besu,” said Allende. “It's not a competition between Besu and EOSIO to see which one is better or worse. It’s not a race to see which one has more transactions per second or better privacy. LACChain is about collaboration.”      Being careful not to protest the case too much, IDB Lab Principal Specialist Alejandro Pardo reiterated the project’s original “agnostic, multiplatform” mission.      “As part of our learning and exploration, we welcome LatamLink and EOS as part of LACChain, as we are fully aware of the exceptional value they bring,” Pardo said.    Enterprise shakeup    EOS Costa Rica recently demonstrated just how it could shake up the enterprise blockchain world. In May of this year, the group fielded an audacious winning bid to provide accountancy major Grant Thornton with a blockchain for intercompany transactions. Speed and scalability were deciding factors, the accounting firm said.      Fernández of EOS Costa Rica said the Grant Thornton team had weighed Ethereum and Hyperledger before choosing EOSIO.      LACChain has also gone through a process of tire-kicking, he said, starting out with Quorum – the Ethereum-based enterprise client built by JPMorgan Chase – and then also testing Linux Foundation-affiliated Hyperledger Fabric, the preferred enterprise blockchain platform of IBM.      Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming      “IDB Labs started out with Quorum but it didn’t really work, it had too many problems,” Fernández said. “Then with Hyperledger Fabric, they found it wasn’t exactly what they were looking for either.”      Allende said LACChain has done tests with Hyperledger Fabric but is yet to launch a Fabric network. “We are interested in [Fabric], but we found it easier with Ethereum-based tech, and now with EOSIO, to get what we were looking for,” Allende said.    LatAm fam    One thing that’s clear is the LatamLink team has had its sights locked on LACChain since its inception. The group made “a very interesting” presentation to IDB and LACChain around November of last year, according to Allende.      In the opinion of Fernández, bringing in some homegrown engineering talent is another important factor when it comes to LACChain.      Read more: Bitcoin in Emerging Markets: Latin America      “We know what EOSIO can do, and we wanted to show that Latin American talent can also build on this Latin American blockchain,” said Fernández. “We don’t need to rely on North America or Europe or Asia. We have the ability and talent to run this infrastructure from three Latin American tech companies.”      That said, LACChain’s Allende wanted to qualify this point, which he said had no bearing on the decision to run the EOSIO network.      “It’s great that we are bringing in more Latin American talent. But that is not the reason we are launching EOSIO. If the developers from LatamLink were from the U.S., we would be doing exactly the same thing,” Allende said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/10/ethereum-and-eosio-square-up-over-enterprise-blockchain-business-in-latin-america,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a016a6ba25261244fedf380f1848a07c8b3508b3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384050,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA0Jp1,1594343142,Coinbase Plans First-Ever Investor Day Amid Talk It May Go Public,"Coinbase has scheduled its first-ever investor day for Aug. 14, amid rumors that the crypto exchange is exploring a public stock listing.      It is unclear, however, whether the virtual event is related to the rumored efforts to go public. A Coinbase spokesperson confirmed the meeting is coming but said it was meant simply “to facilitate a wider understanding of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.”      “This will not be a traditional investor day, but rather an opportunity to hear our perspective on the cryptoeconomy and learn about Coinbase’s role in the ecosystem,” said the spokesperson, Daniel Harrison, in a prepared statement. He declined to provide further details.      Reuters reported earlier Thursday that Coinbase was seeking legal teams in advance of filing for a public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ahead of a direct listing. In a direct listing, shareholders in the private market are able to sell their holdings though the company itself does not issue new shares or raise additional money.      An investor day can often be a harbinger of a planned direct listing, as Jamie McGurk, a former operating partner at Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), wrote on the venture capital firm’s blog lost year.      ""The company will invite investors to their Investor Day, where they will publicly talk about the company and financial results – though still only about historical performance,"" wrote McGurk (now a managing partner with Coatue Management), noting that this takes place about five weeks prior to the first trading day.      A16z, it should be noted, is one of Coinbase’s investors, including leading its $25 million Series B round in December 2013.    Decentralization and direct listings    Direct listings allow existing shareholders, such as venture capitalists, to trade their equity in a public market without the company itself selling any new shares. Silicon Valley darlings Slack and Spotify previously followed this route, which minimizes the use of traditional Wall Street middlemen.      Such a route does not preclude a later public offering. In fact, it can make them more successful.      ""If further financing is needed in the future, the company now has access to the public capital markets as a seasoned issuer, which is one of the primary benefits of being public anyway,"" McGurk wrote.      One person with knowledge of the upcoming meeting said a direct listing would make sense for Coinbase now, with many people in crypto anticipating an upward trajectory to the market soon.      As newer companies like Compound and Kyber use innovative methods to extend ownership of their platforms to users, a direct listing would be the most cost-efficient way to provide Coinbase users with access to shares in the company, the source noted, while still adhering to its legal structure.      Since its founding in 2012, Coinbase has raised a total of $547 million, according to Crunchbase. Its Series E round, in October 2018, valued the company at $8 billion. The San Francisco-based company boasts more than 35 million users and would be the first major U.S. crypto startup to go public, if it were to pursue a listing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/10/coinbase-plans-first-ever-investor-day-amid-talk-it-may-go-public,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e5b87764f9ea0bef5085b13f17a20bea6350c3a6-1311x874.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
