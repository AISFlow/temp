42399535,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh3N,1484002261,Bitcoin's Price Volatile at $900 as China Concerns Linger,"Bitcoin prices experienced intense price volatility on 9th January, continuing a trend that's been the new normal since late last week.  Prices fell nearly 5% in less than two hours across global exchange today, declining from an opening price of $913 to a daily low of $878, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data. After falling, bitcoin prices rose roughly 3.4% to $908.37, before tapering off again below $900.  The continued market volatility comes in the wake of new concerns that the Chinese government may impose further restrictions on the digital currency.  Recently, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) met with representatives of Chinese exchanges OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC, though the details of what was discussed in the meetings, as well as the history between the two camps, remains largely veiled.  What we do know is that the PBOC released two separate statements to the public on 6th January, which both quoted a 2013 government document warning that bitcoin is not a currency and that interested investors should be sure to weigh all relevant risks.  Separate reports have stated that the PBOC may have imposed (or otherwise reinforced) their desire that the exchanges limit marketing and enforce know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules.  These moves have provoked memories of 2013, when bitcoin's sharp price gains prompted China to tighten restrictions on the digital currency.  New confusion  Causing confusion is now what appears to be a divide between what is being reported by local Chinese news sources and the exchanges themselves.  China Securities Journal, for instance, reported today that domestic regulators were considering a ""third-party hosting platform"" to protect investors, according to a prominent local Twitter news feed.  Representatives from major bitcoin exchanges, however, continue to indicate that the meetings were ordinary, with one exchange employee calling the articles ""conjecture"".  In comments to CoinDesk, Star Xu, CEO and founder of bitcoin exchange OKCoin, confirmed that he was present at the 6th January meeting, but stated that the exchange would not be making changes to its operations based on the conversations.  Xu told CoinDesk:  ""OKCoin conducts multiple risk-based measures, including screening users, seeking proof of funds, attesting proper use of the trading platform, verifying ownership of their bank account, and when necessary, rejects their trading capabilities of users who do not satisfy OKCoin's risk-based controls.""  Elsewhere, both OKCoin and BTCC distanced themselves from reports that suggested they were under additional scrutiny due to the potential of capital flight.  Mixed reactions  As for how the the developments will impact markets ahead, market participants seemed uncertain.  Angel investor Chandler Guo, for instance, said that he believes this is ""just a start"" to what could be other activities from the Chinese government to crack down on bitcoin trading, though he did not add any perspective on his opinion.  ""Winter is coming,"" he said, without elaborating further.  Other traders, include Bitcoin Core developer BTC Drak spoke to their general distrust of the Chinese government, noting that the actions seem to have occurred during a particularly positive period for the digital currency and its outlook.  ""The timing was no accident. The price was going crazy, over $1000 [and it was] covered on Chinese state TV,"" he said.  The comments, while unsubstantiated, speak to the general perception in the market regarding developments in China and the practices of China-based exchanges, which have previously come under fire for volume reporting practices.  Outlook unsure  Amid this environment, it's unclear what might happen next.  Bitcoin prices alternate between periods where they are either rangebound or experiencing wild volatility, cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk.  ""We're still in the wildly volatile mode, where minor news can trigger large moves. Sometime soon it will stabilize a bit and we should see the wall of bids and offers building up on both sides, helping stabilize the price.”  Cryptocurrency hedge fund director Tim Enneking also emphasized the key role of market dynamics, noting the sharp price gains enjoyed over the last several sessions. He asserted that bitcoin's prior resistance levels became support because of these rallies.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

The move comes after Anthony Murgio had previously plead not guilty to money transmitting charges, first filed last year. The case has been connected by federal prosecutors to the hacking of major US companies, including JPMorgan Chase.  Murgio changed his plea to guilty on three charges, including the operation of an unlicensed money transmission service, Reuters reports. He now faces sentencing in June.  Attorney Brian Klein, who represents Murgio, confirmed the plea.  He told CoinDesk by email:  ""By pleading guilty, Anthony Murgio accepts full responsibility for his conduct. Today, he was able to start the process of putting what happened behind him. In connection with his sentencing, we look forward to letting the judge know the many positive things about Anthony.""  Coin.mx was a Florida-based exchange that federal prosecutors allege acted as a money conduit for the cybercrime ring behind the JPMorgan hack.

42399525,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgvV,1483986938,India's Axis Bank to Launch Ripple Payments,"India-based Axis Bank will soon begin leveraging distributed ledger tech.  Announced this week, Axis will use Ripple's network for cross-border transactions. As reported by regional news source The Economic Times, the solution's underlying technology will enable real-time settlement for cross-border payments – an area the bank is targeting for future growth.  ""We are committed to using innovation in technology to make banking simple and convenient for our customers,"" deputy managing director V Srinivasan said in a statement, according to the paper.  The launch comes just a few months after Axis partnered with Kotak Mahindra Bank, another Indian banking institution, to test blockchain for new client-facing services. In October, media sources reported that Axis officials were looking ahead to potential product launches utilizing the tech but demurred when asked about any potential launch dates.  ""We will come out with solutions for our customers soon, but we don’t want to commit to any time frame,"" the bank’s president and CIO, Amit Sethi, said at the time.  It was in the middle of last year that Axis's work with blockchain first began to come to light, as reported by The Economic Times. Over the summer, the bank had launched a new FinTech accelerator aimed, in part, at exploring new services for blockchain.  But Axis isn’t the only bank in the region pushing ahead with blockchain.  Fellow Indian banking institution Yes Bank earlier this month announced that it had developed a blockchain-based vendor financing solution, leveraging the open-source Hyperledger code as a basis.  The developments suggest India could emerge at the forefront of enterprise blockchain testing this year should these developments continue to build momentum.

42399530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgyS,1483983018,US Treasury Advisors Weigh Blockchain Insurance Impact,"An advisory council to the US Treasury Department met last week in Washington, DC, to discuss the application of blockchains in the insurance market.  While the discussion itself was relatively brief (taking place in the middle of a nearly three-hour meeting), it did offer a window into the perspective being taken by some of the stakeholders on the council, as well as the government department itself.  Matt Higginson, an associate partner for management consulting firm McKinsey, led a presentation at the hearing during which he offered an expansive view of the technology as well as a bird's-eye view of the insurance industry’s experimentation with blockchain to date. McKinsey released a report on its insurance industry findings last summer.  One key takeaway – for now, is that many insurers remain in that testing phase. The past few months have seen a range of initiatives launched by insurers, particularly based in Europe, centered around collaborative efforts and research.  As Higginson told panel members:  ""There’s a lot of experimentation going on, zero commercial grade. And when we look at what applications they’re being used for today, the biggest are in the reduction of risk and cost.""  During a brief question-and-answer session, panel members asked about areas like competition among insurers in a blockchain environment, as well as the steps taken to shore up privacy among network stakeholders.  On that last point, Higginson went on to say, is that the technology’s nature leaves control of information in the hands of those who are supposed to have it.  ""If I don't know where to look, I don't know where to find it,” he said. ""You need the right cryptographic key to go look at the right information.""

42399534,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh0Q,1483974921,How Barclays Stole the Blockchain Spotlight in 2016,"After keeping its projects to itself in 2015, 2016 may have been Barclays's year – at least, when it came to blockchain tech.  According to industry analysts, there's a strong case the bank is at the forefront of the increasingly large group of incumbents seeking to harness the ""technology behind bitcoin"" heading into 2017.  As noted by Patricia Hines, a senior analyst with Celent's banking practice, a key distinction is that, while other banks may have primarily sought PR pickup, Barclays was able to use its blockchain efforts in 2016 as a competitive differentiator.  From performing the first live trade finance transaction with real customers to expanding smart contract templates, Barclays seems keen on the future of blockchain, she said. It has even been enthusiastic about bitcoin, electing to bank Circle Internet Financial in April.  To some, however, Barclays has only been the most transparent in terms of what it's working on with distributed ledger technology.  Simon Taylor, director of blockchain at 11:FS, who until six months ago headed the bank's blockchain R&D, told CoinDesk:  ""That's the strategy with Barclays, if there's something to show they’ll show it. Others do more stuff under the hood.""  The narrative that Barclays burst onto the scene this year, though, has only some truth, as members of the bank's blockchain group indicate 2016 was the product of early interest.  ""In 2015, there was a lot of activity in the public space and a lot of people wondered why we weren't doing anything yet,"" said Anthony Macey, head of blockchain research at Barclays. ""But we were just playing with toys then.""  Today, the bank continues to experiment – most recently running an equity swaps test organized by Axoni with five other banks in October.  But its chief contribution may be that it has showed the industry some real-world applications for distributed ledger tech.  Cutting costs on trade finance  Probably the most tangible project Barclays completed this year was its trade finance test with blockchain startup Wave.  A member of its own incubator program, Barclays teamed up with the startup to use a blockchain to transfer trade documentation between Oruna, an Irish food co-operative, and Seychelles Trading Company, a product distributor based in Seychelles, an island off the African Coast.  The blockchain platform was able to save Barclays time and money on the transaction, but Macey said, it was easier since the transaction was done in house. Barclays UK sent the payment and Barclays Africa received it.  The live customer test was all about digitizing documentation to produce a unique representation that could be sent far quicker than the 10 days it typically takes to move a physical piece of paper for a trade finance transaction, Macey said.  ""That took us four hours with blockchain,"" he said. ""And removes a lot of vulnerabilities like loss and fraud.""  And really, the platform could have worked much faster had it not been for Seychelles unstable Internet infrastructure, he continued.  Heading into 2017, Barclays wants to expand its blockchain trade finance work, scaling the system by educating stakeholders, even carriers, customs officials and port authorities.  ""All these delays, we understand the reasons why banks should adopt [blockchain] as it reduces time and cost. There's all these little things we can actually tag monetary gains too,"" Macey said. ""But for port authorities and other government officials, that might not be the case.""  Going forward, the bank will need them on board to take full advantage of blockchain’s potential.  Sticking it out with R3  Speaking of collaboration, Barclays also remained a part of enterprise blockchain consortium R3CEV, staying in the union after at least two banks bailed on the project and the startup’s newest funding round.  Barclays was one of nine founding members of R3 and, according to Macey, the bank is still ""strategically aligned"" with the startup.  To date, Barclays seems most interested in developing smart contract templates as it relates to their work with R3, and advancing this learning that is expected to form a large part of its plans in the year ahead.  Looking at The DAO debacle for instance, Macey is optimistic that the bank's work can harness the same technology that enabled it, while infusing it with added stability.  ""It speaks to the reasons we’re very cautious and protective over the infrastructure we utilize for these things. We can’t work with 'code is law,'"" Macey said, adding:  ""That might work online but at some point we’re going to need a lawyer and a structure around these standard contracts that you can codify.""  Banking bitcoin  But while Barclays is moving away from the open-source projects that bootstrapped the blockchain movement, it's not leaving them behind.  For instance, Barclays decided to offer Circle Internet Financial a bank account in 2016, a move that was heralded as progressive even though the startup has scaled back its work with bitcoin a bit.  ""One of the things we’ve worked very hard to try and do is figure out where we have acceptable amounts of risk in providing accounts to new clients,"" Macey said.  And that risk is more about money services businesses (MSB) in general than the use of bitcoin, he noted.  ""The narrative gets lost in the bitcoin community which is why they had problems getting bank accounts early on,"" Macey said. ""If you’re an MSB, it doesn’t matter if it’s bitcoin or not; it’s the same requirements and a very high bar for those that want to play in that space.""  Circle had the controls and governance Barclays needed to see, he said.  Poker face  Yet, it remains to be seen if Barclays can keep up with the pack.  Taylor thinks what's going on behind the scenes at banks like UBS, Citibank and Goldman Sachs might be even more impressive than what he saw at his old firm.  ""Not all banks are chasing the same piece of the pie … so it's apples and oranges to say someone won blockchain this year,"" he said. ""Some of these banks could have great poker hands but they’re not showing it.""  Although, Barclays will stay in the limelight for some time because of its openness with the press, next year, more banks are expected to go live with blockchain products, and real-world tests are ahead.  Already, the DTCC today unveiled how it could move a $11tn derivatives processing workflow to a distributed ledger system.  Barclays with its willingness to test the waters was a standout in 2016, but that might be enough to fend off potentially eager competition.  Shedding light on challenges ahead, Taylor concluded:  ""There’s a huge gulf to cross with using the service once and then scaling it. Getting a service to scale especially in banking is incredibly hard.""

42399539,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh6K,1483971903,Why 2017 is Blockchain's Make or Break Year,"Eric Piscini, a principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP, leads the firm's digital transformation and innovation efforts in the financial services industry, and is the global blockchain leader for financial services.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Piscini argues that 2017 could be the year that blockchain needs to prove its worth in the boardroom – or else risk 'enterprise fatigue'.  2017 could be the make-or-break year for blockchain technology.  That may sound dire, but poll anyone in the financial services industry and they will likely tell you that the technology is still in need of its break-out moment. If significant headway isn't made – or real value delivered, whether in cost savings or new revenue generation – by the end of 2017, I suspect the technology will risk developing fatigue in executive suites.  A key part of the issue is that while progress has been made, the technology has not yet reached widespread adoption – the market is crowded with proofs-of-concept (PoCs), but not enough live implementations.  And while some successes have been achieved, nothing with significant volume, staying power or appropriate scalability has emerged. As a result, the small size of existing applications means that the cost of running blockchain platforms might still be greater than the value derived from them.  Urgency and progress, rather than more of the same, will be essential to move forward.  Upside remains  Yet, it's not all doom and gloom. 2017 will potentially be a banner year for blockchain. In fact, we at Deloitte are quite bullish on our outlook.  Why? Financial institutions have the power and ability to move blockchain to the next level. To get there, companies will likely need to do two key things.  First, they will need to move away from churning out proofs-of-concept, shifting instead toward full-blown solutions.  Second, it will be critical for them to come together and further form industry consortiums to unlock mass-scale value. For blockchain to remain relevant, the entire industry should come together.  And, with more than 20 consortia in place already, we are on our way to success.  In addition, in a recent Deloitte survey of blockchain-knowledgeable executives, just 12%https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/deloitte-survey-blockchain-reaches-beyond-financial-services-with-some-industries-moving-faster.html of financial services executives said their company has deployed blockchain in production. But they are aiming to pick up the pace: 24% say their companies plan to go live with blockchain in the coming year.  Saying goodbye to PoCs  So, how do we ensure a successful future for blockchain? There are two main factors that can help propel blockchain forward in 2017.  First, the industry needs to show that real-world implementation. That can help avoid this proof-of-concept stagnation, while also getting firms excited about blockchain and its actual uses. This is easier said than done and it requires to think differently about blockchain. The proof-of-concept is not the endgame anymore!  The second critical success factor is for firms to come together to form smaller blockchain consortia specific to relevant use cases. These smaller consortia are critical for one simple reason: if you are on your own in blockchain, the value is extremely limited.  They should include a small subset of key players at first, what we call the ""minimal viable ecosystem"". These players should represent all key functions and be represented by financial institutions, technology companies, regulators and consultancies to make them real.  Looking to the future  In addition to moving on from PoCs to real-world implementations and fostering industry partnerships, there are a few additional hurdles for blockchain in 2017.  These include:  Performance and scalability: As an industry, we need blockchains with better performance and scale. We also need an independent way to compare performance across blockchains – a benchmark of some sort.  Regulatory and legal framework: As is often discussed, the regulatory and legal actors need to embrace blockchain technology. And they have done that in a big way in financial services, at least in the US.More progress is clearly needed, however, so other industries regulators such as healthcare, telecommunications or supply chain must follow suit.  Security: While the technology was originally designed to address specific security concerns such as integrity and availability, other security aspects need to be improved. Privacy and confidentiality, especially among the blockchain participants, is still a really important aspect to understand and improve upon.More education is also required on data quality. Blockchains are by default to protect against modifications of data and transactions, not to improve the quality of this data. The “garbage in, garbage out” mentality still applies in blockchain world.  Education: More education is still needed to explain blockchain to industries outside of financial services and to highlight the value that blockchain can bring to an organization.This can help organizations realize the importance of forming smaller blockchain consortiums to tackle larger problems and avoid PoC fatigue. More importantly, we must continue to explain why and when blockchain is not applicable, in order to bring credibility.  Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017?

42399520,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgsY,1483969704,Indonesia's AML Watchdog Links Bitcoin to Islamic State,"Indonesian authorities say they have evidence that Islamic State (IS) militants are using online money services such as PayPal and bitcoin to send money to domestic operatives.  Officials with Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan (PPATK), an independent agency established in 2002 that enforces the country's anti-money laundering (AML) laws, gave the remarks at a public hearing today centered on the agency's performance in 2016.  There, Ivan Yustiavandana, director for examination and research at PPATK, said he believes the use of bitcoin is linked to the preference these groups have shown for technologically sophisticated payment methods.  As quoted by Singapore-based newspaper, The Straits Times, he said:  ""Today we are talking about PayPal, bitcoins. Two to three years from now, we may talk about other means, new ways. The more sophisticated we are at getting them, the more they will try to look for new ways.""  PPATK chairman Kiagus Ahmad Badaruddin added that the agency believes terrorists are using the tools because it makes it ""harder"" for authorities to track the transaction.  Notably, the agency also reported that IS operative Bahrun Naim had been using these means of sending money to IS colleagues. Naim is the man the authorities believe is behind recent attacks in Jakarta in which two civilians were killed and 24 were wounded, according to figures from CNN.  At press time, the statements have also been given additional attention via reporting by The Wall Street Journal.  Terror links  While no data was provided by the agency, the statements are likely to continue the narrative that bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital currencies are becoming an attractive tool for terrorist funding.  Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, for example, the European Union sought to take measures that would enhance the supervision of exchange startups that enable bitcoin to be traded for government-issued money.  However, there is evidence that such claims may be overblown.  The US Treasury Department noted in a risk assessment in 2015 that while the technology may be vulnerable to abuse, it remains unclear how widespread this illicit use of bitcoin has become.  Adding to the perceived prominence of the digital currency, is that bitcoin has emerged as a way for the media to bring added attention to government actions against a broad selection of payment tools given its strong online community and following.

42399524,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjguW,1483966766,$11 Trillion Bet: DTCC to Process Derivatives With Blockchain Tech,"The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has selected a series of firms to help integrate distributed ledger technology into its first large-scale, real-world application.  In the single, complex deal involving a distributed ledger consortium, a stock exchange, a tech startup, a legacy computer firm and an international collection of bulge bracket banks, the post-trade financial services company has begun the process of moving a significant part of its $1.5qn-worth of transaction workflow to a distributed ledger network.  With a contract announced today, IBM will help manage the process of moving $11tn worth of credit derivatives to a custom distributed ledger built by VC-backed startup, Axoni, under the advisement of banking consortium R3CEV.  The CEO of the DTCC's derivatives service subsidiary, Chris Childs, explained to CoinDesk how a network of nodes run by the counterparties of a transaction will be linked together to not only streamline post-trade processes, but save money as well.  He said:  ""We believe our own internal savings will cost-justify the project. There are additional savings to the industry ... the estimates vary from one institution to another.""  Over the course of the next year, the partners will work collaboratively to ""re-platform"" the DTCC's existing Trade Information Warehouse (TIW) for post-trade processing to a distributed ledger custom-built for cleared and bilateral credit derivatives.  For an idea of the scale of this operation, the TIW covers all major global derivatives dealers and 2,500 buy-side firms in 70 countries, according to DTCC data.  The DTCC hasn't shared the exact amount of money it believes could be saved by moving the transactions to a blockchain or distributed ledger, but a 2015 report by Santander estimated the global savings to banks more generally speaking could be as high as $20bn a year.  If this first large-scale implementation of a distributed ledger proves successful, there’s plenty of room to expand. The entire global credit derivatives market in 2016 was $544tn, according to the Bank for International Settlements, much of which is processed by the DTCC.  'Serious solution'  The distributed ledger technology being used for the project is called the AxCore protocol, created by New York-based Axoni, which last month raised $18m in venture capital.  Large participating firms will run their own individual ""peer nodes"" on the private ledger, with smaller DTCC clients being given the option to tap into DTCC’s own node.  Axoni founder and CEO Greg Schvey described the AxCore protocol as ""widely deployed"", revealing to CoinDesk that this same technology is currently being implemented to move $2tn worth of foreign exchange transactions for ICAP, which also participated in his startup's most recent round of venture funding.  Schvey explained that while the ledger itself is permissioned, it will not be exclusively controlled by the companies implementing the protocol.  ""It enables a distributed network to be built on this where, ultimately, participants could have nodes in-house,"" said Schvey.  When the AxCore protocol goes live in early 2018, the startup intends to submit the software to Hyperledger, the business blockchain consortium that has taken on the role of overseeing the infrastructure for a range enterprise distributed ledger codebases.  Current market participants, including Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, UBS and Wells Fargo, helped develop the technology by providing workflow guidance. Infrastructure providers IHS Markit and Intercontinental Exchange also participated.  In conversation with CoinDesk, IBM research vice president of blockchain solutions Ramesh Gopinath described the partnership:  ""If you think about where we were a year ago on blockchain, this is a serious industry-scale blockchain production solution. And guess what, the big kahunas in banking will be on this platform.""  Everything in its right place  Though the scale of this project makes it the first of its kind, the team behind it has been coming together for over a year.  In December 2015, the DTCC, IBM, JP Morgan, and R3CEV were all founding members of the Linux Foundation-led blockchain consortium that would eventually be called Hyperledger.  Just a few months later, in February 2016, IBM unveiled its own blockchain strategy to help a wide range of businesses across industries capitalize on potential efficiencies provided by using a common, shared ledger.  By mid-2016, the DTCC submitted a request for proposal (RFP) for interested parties to ""re-platform"" the warehouse and cut back on reconciliation costs.  Now, IBM is the primary contract holder for the DTCC implementation, with ""backing contracts"" held between Axoni and IBM, and R3 and IBM, Gopinath said.  Gopinath noted that by the time the Axoni technology is fully implemented, the entire life-cycle of a credit derivative will be captured as a smart contract or a ""suite of smart contracts"".  ""This is the ultimate in terms of capturing the entire business process – like we’ve always been talking about – on the blockchain,"" he said.  Send in the startups  But it won't just be the giants of banking involved.  Shortly after IBM unveiled its own blockchain strategy, the little-known Axoni emerged onto the scene, rather discreetly taking a leadership role in the construction and testing of a blockchain-based credit default swaps service with the DTCC, and test members the Bank of America, Merrill Lynch, Citi, Credit Suisse and JPMorgan.  Even at that early phase, Markit, which will also help craft the DTCC blockchain solution, was also participating.  The DTCC project will also move forward under the advisement of blockchain consortium R3CEV, which first emerged in July 2015 to help coordinate global banks looking to capitalize on blockchain and distributed ledger efficiencies.  Since then the consortium has grown to include 77 of the largest banks in the world, and through the development of its Corda protocol, overcome a series of obstacles to become one of the most recognizable names in blockchain.  R3 CEO and founder David Rutter positioned his company’s role as advisor to the DTCC project from both a technological perspective and from a banking workflow perspective.  Rutter told CoinDesk:  ""It’s a combination of really helping validate that the architecture is sound, but also making sure that the feedback from this big R3 global network is heard.""  'Goodbye, blockchain tourism'  Deployment of the AxCore protocol will be done in phases, and even after it goes live next year, may only be adopted slowly.  Initially, the distributed ledger will run in parallel with the existing settlement infrastructure, which can take as long as a week to close compared to the nearly instant settlement times expected from the blockchain solution.  But the goal is to eventually ""retire"" the existing TIW technology, according to Childs.  However, the CEO of DTCC’s derivatives service subsidiary added that one of the most desirable potential aspects of DLT might not be available early on.  In addition to providing streamlined processing by supporting self-executing code, or smart contracts, it is widely heralded as a bastion of transparency.  Since the distributed ledger's record is immutable, a regulatory node has the potential to give government observers access to real-time data about transactions, instead of having to wait for reports from market participants.  But in the DTCC’s current Trade Information Warehouse, regulators might not get reports at all. Disclosure is voluntary, according to Childs.  Opening up the fire hose of data to government controllers, he said, may not be so appealing to all involved.  ""Clearly the capability of them being established as a node on the network exists with blockchain,"" said Childs. ""But it's still very much to be determined.""  Regardless of the progress still yet to be made, IBM’s Gopinath minced no words about what the complicated, multi-party partnership means to anyone building on a distributed ledger.  Gopinath concluded:  ""Goodbye, blockchain tourism and hello blockchain systems that are large-scale. That turning point has happened.""

42399526,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjgxT,1483962759,"Bitcoin is Still Volatile, But That Doesn't Mean It's Not Viable","Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  After teasing us for most late 2016, bitcoin *almost* reached a new all-time high in the first week of 2017. That is, before startling everyone with a sharp crash, rally and correction.  The headlines were gripping, and transmitted that edge-of-your-seat feeling that something big was going on.  But was there?  I don't want to imply that price movements aren't important. A steady increase sends a message, as does a sharp plunge. But the messages sent mask the real news – bitcoin is becoming a valid alternative to fiat currencies, not because of its price, but because of its relative lack of volatility.  Outlook unchanged  Yes, I do mean ""lack of"".  A 20% slump in one day is severe, certainly, and has no doubt caused short-term traders considerable stress. But, in the big picture, it's not material.  We need to remember that, after the initial slump, bitcoin’s price ended up roughly where it was at the beginning of the week. No one can deny that bitcoin has performed well.  Whether the performance is due to fundamentals such as geopolitical uncertainty or monetary turbulence (neither of which are going away any time soon), or to market dynamics (which fluctuate, as always), the outlook of bitcoin is still the same as it was a week ago.  Sure, China accounts for most of bitcoin’s trading volume, and so has a strong influence on price movements, but the fundamentals are still there.  Sentiment is still bullish. Experts polled by CoinDesk at the end of last year predicted end-of-2017 prices of between $1,400 and $3,000.  While the eventual performance is not that relevant for bitcoin fundamentals, it does signal enough robust support to withstand short-term fluctuations.  Volatility, in context  Much more important than the price is bitcoin’s volatility.  Over the past few months it has fallen to levels generally considered ""acceptable"" for fiat currencies. This week's performance will no doubt push bitcoin's volatility index up a notch, but it's still less than half of what it was six months ago.  Over the past three months, bitcoin's volatility (30-day vs the US$) has on occasion been lower than the South African rand, the Brazilian real and even gold. It has been close to that of the yen, the British pound and the euro.  And here’s the kicker: it has achieved this without central bank intervention.  This is what we should be focusing on: bitcoin’s volatility, in spite of this week's movements, is approaching that of supposedly stable fiat currencies. And it’s doing so on its own.  No fiat currency can say that.  Stability ahead  And so, whatever the price movements, bitcoin is successfully showing the world that its value as an independent alternative is strong.  As any economist will tell you, one of the basic requirements of ""good money"" is that its value be relatively stable.  Low volatility does not produce dramatic headlines, but it is a much more important metric for investors, entrepreneurs and developers. And as new entrants join the market, volumes will continue to increase, sources will diversify, and bitcoin’s volatility will continue its downward trend.

42399537,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjh4M,1483959539,2017: When Ethereum Will Go From IT to Enterprise,"Jeremy Millar began his career as one of the first Java architects at Oracle, and is now the chief instigator at blockchain firm ConsenSys, where he plays a lead in its evolving enterprise strategy.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Millar discusses how he believes the community galvanizing around the ethereum blockchain will continue to grow – and gain big business support – in 2017.  Enterprise use of blockchain technology has evolved at an almost unfathomable rate over the past 24 months.  From early bitcoin experiments, to senior bankers joining startups, to the launch of the public ethereum decentralized application platform, to the many private, permissioned systems using the technology, blockchain has emerged as one of the top enterprise IT trends entering 2017.  Yet, the market has already moved beyond the incubation phase where innovators effectively build the technology along with their initial applications, and possibly beyond the early adopter phase, too.  Increasingly, mainstream enterprise IT organizations are not only educating themselves and experimenting with blockchain, they are also aiming to tackle novel use cases and complex IT challenges with the technology.  More and more frequently, our clients are asking for assistance building MVPs not PoCs, or hardening environments for production readiness.  With this whirlwind of adoption, it is also clear that certain key technologies are emerging as potential de facto standards as blockchain platforms.  Why IT loves ethereum  Ethereum is, arguably, the most commonly used blockchain technology for enterprise development today.  With more than 20,000 developers globally, the benefits of a public chain holding roughly $1bn of value, not to mention an emerging open-source ecosystem of development tools, it is little wonder that Accenture observed ""every self-respecting innovation lab"" is running and experimenting with it.  Cloud vendors are also supporting ethereum as a first-class citizen: Alibaba Cloud, Microsoft Azure, RedHat OpenShift, Pivotal CloudFoundry all feature ethereum as one of their, if not their primary, blockchain offering.  Why? The software is widely available and its simple to download an ethereum client; pick your favorite development environment and get going.  Ethereum is general purpose and easy to program – full stack and web developers can pick up the basics of the Solidity smart contract programming language in a matter of hours and develop initial applications in days.  Documentation is plentiful, as are code samples, deployment frameworks and training. Little wonder that so many companies are using ethereum as their blockchain of choice.  Today, enterprises are deploying private ethereum networks in or near production in areas as diverse as supply chain tracking, payments, data privacy, compliance and asset tokenization just to name a few.  Three challenges  Now certainly, we are some time away from seeing investment banks fully migrate securities clearing and settlement to ethereum networks.  That said, however, we already do see private ethereum blockchain networks in production – even in financial services.  Enterprises adopting ethereum face a number of challenges, notably:  Ethereum was developed initially for public chain deployment, where trustless transaction requirements outweigh absolute performance. The current public chain consensus algorithms (notably, proof of work) are overkill for networks with trusted actors and high throughput requirements.  Public chains by definition have limited (at least initially) privacy and permissioning requirements. Although ethereum does enable permissioning to be implemented within the smart contract and network layers, it is not readily compatible 'out of the box' with traditional enterprise security and identity architectures, or data privacy requirements.  Naturally, the current Ethereum Improvement Process is largely dominated by public chain matters, and it has been challenging for enterprise IT requirements to be prioritized within it.  As a result, many enterprises who have implemented private ethereum networks have either 'tweaked' or forked open-source implementations, or relied on proprietary vendor extensions to meet their requirements.  Some of these are extremely sophisticated and are on the cutting edge of computer science; for example: BlockApps STRATO, Hydrachainhttp://www.brainbot.com/hydra,Quorum, Parity, Dfinity and Raiden.  While understandable, and in fact until now, the only effective approach, the downsides are obvious: lack of application portability, code base fragmentation, and vendor lock-in.  Historical parallels  Not surprisingly, this has been a point of conversation for some months between enterprise tech vendors, corporate users and ethereum startups.  These discussions have expanded, with the blessing and involvement of ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the non-profit Ethereum Foundation, into a dedicated group of vendors where the largest corporate users and ethereum infrastructure leaders are collaborating to define a roadmap, legal structure, governance and initial technical developments.  To some extent, this parallels the paths of other significant platform technologies, such as TCP/IP and HTTP and perhaps (from a software perspective) more relevantly Java and Hadoop.  Java was never intended to be a broadly used enterprise development tool; it was in fact developed originally for interactive television (specifically set-top boxes and smart cards – who remembers Java Card?).  However, Java had many advantages for web development with database back-ends (known as web client-server or three-tier architecture): it had comprehensive web and database APIs, it provided 'write-once, run anywhere' platform portability, simplified object-oriented programming constructs with familiar syntax, and a rapidly development ecosystem.  Indeed, it was not even Sun that created Java Enterprise Edition (at that time, J2EE); it was a plucky startup (WebLogic) and a group of enterprise customers and other vendors. Similarly, Hadoop was originally created to index the web and for advertising serving.  And who knew TCP/IP would emerge into a protocol that today, literally exists everywhere?  Solutions on the way  In this way, I would argue ethereum is one of the few, indeed perhaps the only, blockchain technology with a similar trajectory and potential.  Even the early ""public permissionless"" vs ""private permissioned"" differentiation strongly echoes the Internet vs intranet deployment considerations that were so prevalent before businesses became comfortable with security and scalability issues of public infrastructure.  By banding together the key adopters, supporters and shapers of enterprise usage of ethereum, we are seeking to provide a platform not only for the technology, but also to provide the governance and tools to create a standard for 'Enterprise Ethereum'.  It is a group of builders and doers, developing sufficient governance for enterprise requirements, but not 'death by committee' and without 'pay to play'.  Some of our collaborators have noted the refreshing nature of this approach and the pace of technical progress that is achievable from working off a single standard and open-source code base.  Moreover, Enterprise Ethereum will build upon the current ethereum scaling roadmap and maintain compatibility and interoperability with public ethereum. In fact, we believe Enterprise Ethereum will soon contribute significantly to the overall development of ethereum.  Stay tuned… the best is yet to come.
