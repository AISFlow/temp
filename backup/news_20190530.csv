42402945,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtWl,1559249944,"State Farm, USAA to Pay Each Other Insurance Claims on Blockchain by 2020","U.S. insurance giants State Farm and USAA have entered advanced testing of a blockchain to automate the time-consuming and paper-heavy processing of automobile claims.  Announced Thursday, the companies developed this system using Quorum, the private enterprise version of ethereum created by JPMorgan Chase.  State Farm and USAA began working on the joint platform (which is yet to be named) in early 2018. State Farm disclosed the project was in early trials in December, but kept USAA’s involvement under wraps at the time.  Now, the firms are using real claims data and expect to go into production around the end of this year.  The ledger shared by the two companies is designed to replace existing systems for subrogation. This is typically the last phase of the claims process when one insurance company recovers claim costs it paid to its customer for damages from the at-fault party’s insurance company.  In simple terms: if Bob dents Alice’s car, Alice’s insurer pays her to repair it and then bills Bob’s insurer.  Today, these business-to-business payments are handled consecutively, often requiring paper checks to be mailed on a claim-by-claim basis between insurers. Subrogation payments totaled about $9.6 billion across all U.S insurance carriers last year, according to Mike Fields, an innovation executive at State Farm.  To streamline this process, the new blockchain nets out the balance of these payments (which run into the thousands each month) and facilitates a single payment on a regular basis between insurers.  Fields told CoinDesk:  “For now, it’s two companies on the distributed ledger but we could have many carriers participating. The blockchain keeps track of every individual instance and these can be netted at different intervals; weekly, monthly, whatever time frame you want.”  Blockchainers in the public space working with cryptocurrencies and tokens might think this is a relatively modest innovation, but Ramon Lopez, vice president of innovation at USAA, emphasized the challenge of simply getting two large competing firms to collaborate, adding:  “I think innovation is hard already, but the ability for two very large companies like State Farm and USAA to partner their innovation teams to bring something to light is worth mentioning as well.”  Why Quorum?  Quorum is a somewhat surprising choice of platform for State Farm and USAA.  That’s because both are members of the RiskStream Collaborative, the insurance blockchain consortium, which last year announced R3’s Corda platform would be its distributed ledger technology (DLT) of choice.  The re-insurance blockchain consortium B3i has also opted for Corda, suggesting an interoperability play across the insurance industry.  According to State Farm’s Field, Quorum’s focus on data privacy was a factor in the decision.  “When we were starting out on this journey, we looked at them [DLTs] all. We wanted a private permissioned network that we could invite others to join with strong privacy and security.”  State Farm and USAA did look at Corda, Field said, adding that it too would have been a suitable platform.  “Corda has a lot of good attributes,” he said.  Lopez stressed that both firms had embarked on a learning curve involving four phases of testing.  “We are at phase two right now and continue to learn from this technology and from one another,” he said.  Field said both State Farm and USAA are actively participating in the consortium use cases being built at RiskStream, but hinted at the need to get out there and innovate, concluding:  “We just saw this as an opportunity to go faster with a narrower focus.”  USAA image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/05/30/state-farm-usaa-to-pay-each-other-insurance-claims-on-blockchain-by-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/81f30077bd16fb0afe7103e7796d8a2e9ac8d3e4-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42402946,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtXk,1559248581,Ethereum Classic May Delay Upcoming Hard Fork 'Atlantis',"Ethereum classic's open-source developer team failed to reach a consensus Thursday on whether to move forward with a forthcoming system-wide code upgrade as outlined, effectively sending the planned batch of upgrades back to a drafting stage.  Developers have been deliberating on a set of 10 proposals to be integrated into the protocol since February, an upgrade colloquially called ""Atlantis."" A continuation of the original ethereum blockchain, ethereum classic (ETC) effectively broke away from the project in 2016, subsequently rising to a near $1 billion valuation, according to CoinMarketCap.  Still, while ethereum classic has strived to carve out a unique value proposition (based on an altered monetary policy among other differences), its community has also been making greater efforts to introduce changes to the network that would make interoperability between the two blockchains easier.  In fact, Atlantis is the first of two protocol upgrades or hard forks aimed at incorporating the EIPs that have already been activated on ethereum in recent years.  ""These upgrades would bring ETC up to date with ETH's latest protocol, making migration of dapps between the networks much easier,"" wrote Bob Summerwill, the executive director of Ethereum Classic Cooperative in an email newsletter back in May.  Today, it was expected that the community would come to a final decision about the contents of the upgrade and its planned activation for mid-September. However, some developers expressed hesitation about including one particular proposal – EIP 170 – into the Atlantis upgrade.  Summarizing his thoughts on the proposal in a GitHub comment, ethereum classic developer Anthony Lusardi wrote:  ""These rules can simply be applied to transaction validation rather than block validation, making it a soft fork rather than a hard fork... It's vitally important to stick to pre-agreed rules when they're defined.""  EIP 170  As background, EIP 170 if implemented would put a fixed cap on the size of smart contract code that can be run in a single transaction. This idea was originally conceived by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin who explained at the time that a cap was necessary to prevent certain attack scenarios on the blockchain.  However like Lusardi, ethereum classic community member ""MikO"" argues this change doesn't have to be a hard fork (i.e. backwards incompatible).  ""I don't like the idea of having to change a hard limit in the future if we desire more complex contracts,"" wrote MikO on the ethereum classic Discord channel.  At the same time, both Lusardi and MikO emphasize their disagreements with EIP 170 should not delay or in any way obstruct the progression of the Atlantis upgrade.  MikO highlighted:  ""If everyone feels setting this limit in this way is the way to proceed, then I agree with the majority.""  Lusardi added that outside of not wanting to delays the Atlantis upgrade, he doubly doesn't believe that ""any one person should be able to halt the [upgrade] process.""  For now, no decision has been made on the timeline or content of the Atlantis upgrade as a result of the comments shared in today's developer call.  ""Let's just acknowledge there's discussion around EIP 170 and take this time, another one or two weeks [to discuss] what's the problem with a maximum code size limits and how to move on,"" concluded ethereum classic developer soc1c.

We tracked him down in Beijing to get clarity on his attempt to wrest to control or, most likely, comment on Craig S. Wright's white paper registration.  Liu is a crypto entrepreneur from China and said his goal in registering the document was to point out that copyright is technically meaningless in this context. To be clear, Liu chose not to answer whether or not he is Satoshi Nakamoto when asked by CoinDesk.  He said:  “I filed it just to let people know anyone can register a copyright. Everyone can be Satoshi Nakamoto.""  ""Now we can both show our credentials and see who ends up wearing an orange suit!"" Craig Wright told Decrypt in response to our initial story.  Liu was the former COO of F2Pool and started bitcoin mining in 2011.  Liu's filing is dated May 24, a few days after Wright registered his copyright. Liu retweeted a Weibo post on Thursday to clarify it was him who filed the second copyright registration after some Craig Wright supporters indicated online that ""only CSW can register a copyright, no one else can.""  Clearly, as we see, someone else can.  Wolfie Zhao contributed reporting.

Livio Weng, CEO of Huobi Global, told CoinDesk through a spokesperson that the exchange ""is not involved in any wash trading,"" and any such actions would go against the exchange's ""core values.""  A report by Bitwise Asset Management which implied that Huobi reported inflated trading volume ""surprised"" its team, he said, and the exchange ""subsequently did a thorough check and review of our system.""  Huobi did not find any evidence of systematic abuse, he said, but added:  ""We did identify a few of our market makers conducting what we suspect may have been wash trading for the sake of performance and marketing purposes. We have already communicated with these market makers and they have discontinued the strategies in question.""  Huobi is now in the process of updating its policies so as to avoid potential wash trading issues going forward, he added. Huobi did not immediately respond to a request for further details.  Wash trading occurs when participants collude to sell an asset back and forth to each other at ever-higher prices, creating the illusion of a rising market.  'Anomalous pattern'  In a report published in March, Bitwise said that Bitfinex, bitFlyer, Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit, Kraken and Poloniex were the only exchanges that appeared to report genuine trade volumes, citing low arbitrage across these exchanges, as well as their reported volumes in comparison with the overall market.  The asset management firm, which is seeking the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) approval to launch a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), published another report on Friday, where it noted that at least one exchange – Huobi – had begun reporting different trade volumes within a few weeks of its initial report.  Huobi had an ""anomalous pattern"" according to an analysis of its reported trades, which indicated a ""resurgence of large trade sizes,"" the new report said.  This pattern was ""consistent"" until the initial Bitwise report was published. ""Then it completely disappeared within three weeks.""  Bitwise could not explain why the reported trade volume shifted, though the new report suggested that ""those engaging in wash trading at Huobi changed their trade size signatures to be more in line with our detection methods.""  ""We also recognize that Huobi might have taken action to clean up wash trading on their platform within that time frame, but that view is challenged by the fact that Huobi's reported bitcoin trade volume did not meaningfully drop during that time,"" Bitwise added.

As part of the arrangement, California-based Cred will migrate a portion of its native ""LBA"" token to Binance’s blockchain network, Binance Chain, according to an announcement Wednesday.  Binance chief growth officer Ted Lin said that as Binance Chain has a “one-second block time,” it will help Cred scale its operations to more markets and users, and ensure transactions are “fast, efficient and effortless.”  Cred offers two services: “Borrow” and “Earn,” according to information from its website. The former allows users to borrow fiat currencies with cryptocurrencies as collateral, while the latter offers interest rates on deposited cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.  The firm is backed by investors including Binance Labs and Arrington XRP Capital, and claims to have already secured over $300 million in lending capital, according to the announcement.  Earlier this year, Cred also formed an alliance with cryptocurrency exchange Bittrex and four other blockchain firms, to launch a euro-pegged stablecoin called the “universal euro.” The stablecoin can also potentially offer holders an annual rate of return if deposited with Cred, the group said at the time.  The addition is the latest new offering from Binance. Last week, the exchange confirmed that it will be launching a margin trading service in the near future.  It's also recently launched its decentralized exchange, set up a fiat-to-crypto exchange in Singapore and unveiled a new platform in Australia that allows users to buy bitcoin with cash from newsagents.

42402943,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtUn,1559220300,Australian Securities Watchdog Updates Guidance on ICOs and Crypto Assets,"The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has issued updated regulatory guidance for businesses involved with ICOs and crypto assets.  Announced  Thursday, the guidance details the legal obligations for cryptocurrency firms under the country’s Corporations Act, the ASIC Act and other laws.  “These regulatory requirements are in place to maintain the integrity of Australia’s financial market and ensure consumer protection,” the regulator said.  ICOs and crypto assets in many cases are financial products or involve financial products that are regulated under the Corporations Act, according to ASIC. Therefore, if a firm is issuing a token that falls within the definition of a financial product (such as an interest in a managed investment scheme or a security), laws will apply, including the requirement to hold an Australian financial services (AFS) license.  Laws also cover those giving advice, dealing, or providing other intermediary services for crypto-based financial products.  Cryptocurrency wallet and custody service providers, on the other hand, need to ensure they hold the appropriate custodial and depository authorizations. Cryptocurrency miners, if assisting the clearing and settlement of tokens that are financial products, are also bound by Australian laws.  Cryptocurrency exchanges and trading platforms also need to comply with applicable rules, including holding an Australian market license, while cryptocurrency payment and merchant service providers are required to apply for an AFS license if they are providing “non-cash payment facility,"" as well as complying with a number of laws.  John Price, ASIC commissioner, said:  “Australian laws will also apply even if the ICO or crypto-asset is promoted or sold to Australians from offshore. Issuers of ICOs, crypto-assets and their advisers should not assume the use of these structures means that key consumer protections under Australian laws do not apply or can be ignored.""  For ICOs and crypto assets that are not financial products, promoters must ensure that they do not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct or statements, ASIC said.  ASIC first issued regulatory guidance for ICOs in 2017. At the time, rules were mainly focused on Australian consumer law and the country’s Corporations Act.

42402957,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtfc,1559215506,Bitcoin Remains on Hunt for $9K After Defense of Key Price Support,"View  Bitcoin bounced up from $8,420 on Wednesday, forming a bullish higher low. The 4-hour chart now shows a bull flag breakout. As a result, a rally to $9,000 looks possible.  A pennant breakout confirmed on Sunday has already created room for a rally to $10,000. On the way higher, BTC may face selling pressure near the key Fibonacci retracement level of $9,442.  The short-term bullish case would weaken if BTC finds acceptance below the former resistance-turned-support at $8,390. A bearish volume divergence on the daily chart does indicate scope for a price pullback.  Bitcoin (BTC) remains on the hunt for $9,000, having established a bullish pattern at key price support in the last 24 hours.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization is currently trading at $8,730 on Bitstamp, representing a 0.8 percent gain on the day. Prices hit a high of $8,785 earlier today.  Trading kicked off on a pessimistic note on Wednesday, with prices falling below the former resistance-turned-support of $8,500 (July 2018 high) in the Asian trading hours.  However, the drop to levels close to the May 16 high of $8,390 – also a former hurdle-turned-support – was short-lived and prices bounced back to $8,663 by UTC close, according to Bitstamp data.  Essentially, BTC established a bullish higher-low pattern in the key support zone yesterday, strengthening the bullish case put put forward by Sunday's pennant breakout.  The path of least resistance, therefore, is to the higher side. Even so, buyers need to observe caution, as the cryptocurrency has already rallied more than 60 percent this month. Sudden price pullbacks are usually seen after such stellar rallies.  4-hour chart  BTC witnessed a bull flag breakout – a continuation pattern known to accelerate the preceding bullish move – on the 4-hour chart earlier today, creating room for a rally to $9,940 (target as per the measured move method).  The pennant breakout confirmed on Sunday has already opened the doors to $10,000.  On the way higher, BTC may face resistance at $9,442 – the 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of the drop from the December 2017 high to December 2018 low.  It is worth noting that BTC created a doji candle with a long upper shadow – a sign of buyer exhaustion – in the four hours to 08:00 UTC, marking a weak follow-through to the bull flag breakout.  Should the doji candle’s high of $8,785 prove a tough nut to crack over the next few hours, a price pullback could be seen.  The case for a rise to $9,000, however, would weaken only if the newly established higher low at $8,420 is breached.  Daily chart  The daily trading volume bars continue to produce lower highs, contradicting the higher highs on price.  That bearish volume divergence takes the shine off the pennant breakout confirmed Sunday and indicates that the rally to $9,000 or above could be short-lived or may be preceded by a correction to $8,000.  Trading volumes need to pick up for a sustained move above $9,000.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42402956,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtcf,1559214023,Who Is Wei Liu? Second Copyright Filing Appears for Bitcoin White Paper,"Craig Wright, the Australian entrepreneur who recently and controversially filed copyright registrations for the bitcoin white paper and original code, now has a legal rival.  A second copyright registration (number TX0008726120) for the white paper has appeared on the public catalog of the United States Copyright Office, indicating that a certain Wei Liu is also claiming to have originated the work under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.  The filing is dated May 24, 2019, while Wright's is dated April 11, 2019.  Currently, it is not clear who Wei Liu is or why the registration was filed. However, it may well be that it is a counter to Wright's move to assert ownership of fundamental bitcoin property. That came amid a flurry of legal threats from Wright against those who claim he is not Satoshi as he has claimed on various occasions – though he has yet to provide indisputable proof, such as a movement of Satoshi's bitcoin.  Wright is also a key mover behind the cryptocurrency Bitcoin SV (for ""Satoshi Vision"") and said he would put the copyright registration in the hands of the foundation managing the token.  A press release sent to CoinDesk at the time reads:  “In the future, Wright intends to assign the copyright registrations to Bitcoin Association to hold for the benefit of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Association is a global industry organization for Bitcoin businesses. It supports BSV and owns the Bitcoin SV client software.”  To be clear, a registration is not recognition of a work's authorship by the U.S. Copyright Office. The copyright process allows anyone to register a work, often in relation to lawsuits associated with ownership.  Indeed, the office said in a press release after the Wright registrations stirred up something of a storm, that it has not “recognized” anyone as the inventor of bitcoin.  “As a general rule, when the Copyright Office receives an application for registration, the claimant certifies as to the truth of the statements made in the submitted materials. The Copyright Office does not investigate the truth of any statement made,” the Copyright Office wrote.  “In a case in which a work is registered under a pseudonym, the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author,” it clarified.  The same will apply to the registration by Wei Liu.

The Bank of Ireland, AIB and Ulster Bank are using a blockchain solution from Deloitte for the pilot initiative, news outlet Fora reported Thursday.  The solution, said to be the “first of its kind"" in the European financial services industry, has been built using ethereum by Deloitte’s EMEA Financial Services Blockchain Lab in Dublin to verify and track staff credentials and qualifications data, according to the report.  Staff will have their credentials held in a digital wallet, which will be used to help banks comply with Central Bank of Ireland regulations for meeting specific standards for senior staff.  Ireland’s Institute of Banking – which holds professional certification data on 23,500 banking employees currently – is also a participant in the project, which is expected to run until the end of the summer. A full live launch expected by mid-2020 for the institute’s members, according to the report.  Blockchain-based verification of credentials is a growing use case for the technology.  Earlier this year, financial services giant PwC launched a similar blockchain-based platform called Smart Credentials allowing company employees to be issued digital copies of professional qualifications.  Malaysia’s education ministry has also launched a blockchain platform called e-Scroll for the issuance and verification of university degrees. While U.S. Customs and Border Protection also recently began a blockchain trial to verify North American Free Trade Agreement and the Central American Free Trade Agreement certificates.  The three Irish banks have been trialing blockchain tech in other areas, too. As far back as 2016, AIB and Ulster Bank participated in a blockchain payments trial, also organized by Deloitte.

A state-owned newspaper in Sichuan publishedhttps://e.thecover.cn/shtml/hxdsb/20190530/107311.shtml a front-page article on Thursday saying the land-resource bureau in Sichuan's Garze county has found bitcoin mining farms with no prior approval built at the sites of hydropower stations.  The article added that the Economic and Information Bureau in Garze – a mountainous area with abundant water resources – has formed a committee with other agencies to probe into the illegal construction issue.  ""We are still investigating on the issue and can't disclose more details on the overall situation,"" one official from the Economic and Information Bureau was quoted as saying.  The issue at hand is that bitcoin mining farms were found being built at hydropower stations along the Dadu river in northwestern Sichuan to make the most of the cheap electricity in the area, but did not obtain authorization for construction beforehand.  The article identified one specific bitcoin mining facility within a hydropower plant called Ginkang station, which has the capacity to host 50,000 units of bitcoin mining equipment, of which 60 percent are already operating.  ""If [a bitcoin mining farm] is built within the authorized area of a power station for electricity consumption, we need to verify if their usage is legal. If it's outside the authorized area, then it needs to be dealt with as the construction was not approved,"" an official from the local land resource bureau said in the report.  As the summer rainy season approaches in China, miners have been investing again in Sichuan's mountainous areas including the Garze and Aba counties, hoping to boost ROI with the regions' cheap power.  In a report published last November by blockchain research firm Coinshare, nearly 50 percent of the global bitcoin network's hash rate came from facilities located in Sichuan at the time.  Recently, the bitcoin network's total hash rate has climbed to nearly 58,000 petahashes per second – that's up about 80 percent from last December, when more than 600,000 mining machines were estimated to have shut down amid bitcoin's bear market prices.  The official from the Economic and Information Bureau further indicated that Garze county does not allow bitcoin mining projects.  They said:  ""We don't allow outside investment in the area to be involved in bitcoin. Even for big data projects, we will conduct an investigation into the nature of the data involved before making a decision.""

42402952,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAddtbg,1559203243,New Game From 'CryptoKitties' Creator Nets $275K in First-Week Spending,"Thousands of cheese-shaped cartoon wizards will soon duel online for a grand prize of ether tokens.  Dapper Labs, the company behind the 2017 CryptoKitties craze, unveiled its newest ethereum-based gaming experience – “Cheeze Wizards” – last Friday. The game has already attracted 973 players who purchased 4,470 fighters, according to Dapper Labs head of communications Bryce Bladon.  Most of the ether spent on these digital wizards goes toward prizes, with 607 ETH going to the game's grand prize. A total of 1,013 ETH has been collected so far, for roughly $275,000 at current prices.  Bladon told CoinDesk the first tournament, where all these wizards duel until just one is left with “the big cheese,” will take several weeks and kick off later this summer.  “Players summon wizards, each of which is a non-fungible token (NFT),” Bladon said. “The winner gets a portion of the losing wizard’s power. ... Using rock-paper-scissors logic, a winner is picked for each of the five spells cast.”  Since this online game involves monetary prizes, users from Canada, Arkansas, Arizona, Kentucky, Maryland, South Carolina and Tennessee are unable to participate in tournaments because the relevant regulations in those jurisdictions are unclear. However, gamers from these areas have already found ways to develop external applications so they can participate in the ecosystem. At least five different projects have already been built on the cheesetastic game, from a prediction market to a decentralized exchange platform for trading wizards.  Dapper Labs itself attracted more than $15 million in investment last year from funds like Venrock, Google’s GV, Samsung Next and Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures. Like the studio’s debut game CryptoKitties, the self-custodied NFTs in “Cheeze Wizards” are designed to acquire unique traits that could provide opportunities for usage beyond the Dapper Labs tournament itself.  One Canadian player, Glenn Eggleton, has already created a leader board and external battle game in order to experiment with the partially open-source project.  “Building decentralized applications [dapps] is extremely time-consuming because the industry is so very young,” Eggleton told CoinDesk. “With each new dapp the technology gets better and better. As a community we are funding the development of that technology by playing, which I think is super cool.”  Bladon agreed that extensibility – meaning the ability to take the asset away from the original game and use it elsewhere – is the determining factor for Dapper Labs’ crypto games. “Cheeze Wizards” uses the startup’s ethereum wallet, Dapper, yet is also compatible with most crypto wallets.  He said the most salient lesson the gaming startup learned from CryptoKitties was the importance of fostering a community that will build on and contribute to a robust ecosystem. This is what distinguishes dapps from other gaming experiences.  As such, Bladon said Dapper Labs plans to create opportunities and support for developers who want to build tools, features and parallel experiences related to “Cheeze Wizards.”  “[Community] is the one thing you can’t really fake at scale,” he said, adding:  “A lot of blockchain games are trying to appeal to the mass market by sacrificing the decentralization and using side chains or hosted solutions. We want to go to the other side of the spectrum and create a game with the community for an experiment with user behavior in crypto networks.”  Correction (May 30, 15:45 UTC): “Cheeze Wizards” users spent 1,013 ETH in the first week, not 607 ETH. The previously reported 607 ETH is the amount from the total pool directed toward the game's grand prize. The story and its headline have been updated with the correct values (""Nearly $200K"" was the amount previously listed in the headline).  “Cheeze Wizards” image via Dapper Labs",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/05/30/new-game-from-cryptokitties-creator-nets-275k-in-first-week-spending,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be8542a4cd0a2375160a2b3d96a89c5da54bc5a0-1500x844.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381978,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9qNX5,1559179629,"In First, Tezos Blockchain Activates Upgrade By Token Holder Voting","The Tezos blockchain has officially been upgraded.  In a first for Tezos, two separate backwards-incompatible changes have been activated on the network after three months of on-chain voting by stakeholders. The Tezos self-amendment process which began for this first time back in February came to a close late Wednesday with the successful activation of an upgrade proposal, dubbed Athens A, just after 9 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.  Proposed by a Tezos developer group called Nomadic Labs, Athens A reduces the minimum amount of tokens called rolls required for a user to become a baker on the network from 10,000 XTZ to 8,000 XTZ. Bakers are the equivalent to miners on a proof-of-work blockchain and are tasked with responsibilities such as verifying transactions and creating new blocks.  ""The reduction will result in a bigger amount of XTZ staked,"" emphasized CMO of Everstake – a staking-as-a-service provider on Tezos – Alexandr Kerya to CoinDesk. ""Now if a baker has 16k, only 10k is staking while after the upgrade the baker will have 2 rolls engaged in staking. There will be fewer 'leftovers' so to speak which is particularly important for small bakers.""  Athens A additionally increases computation limits on Tezos blocks to allow for larger transaction throughput.  Speaking to the full process of on-chain governance that led up to today's successful upgrade activation, Arthur Breitman, the creator of Tezos, told CoinDesk:  ""The Athens activation demonstrates that cryptocurrencies do not have to choose between being stuck with early technological choices or protecting themselves against interference. Upgrades can be automated, decentralized, and self-funding.""  Breitman added that ""participation was a huge success with over 80 percent of the votes cast, twice, in a period of a few months.""  Agreeing with this sentiment, Awa Sun Yin, founder of the second most popular public baking service on Tezos Cryptium Labs, noted that Tezos' on-chain governance process is ""conservative,"" requiring high levels of participation and lengthy periods of repetitive voting rounds.  ""Thus, we were concerned about voter apathy and voter fatigue,"" said Sun Yin. ""Yet, we managed to surpass quorum requirements in every phase and I am impressed by how closely the community has been relentlessly following through the entire process, actively reminding all bakers to participate.""  Automatized upgrades  Tezos' on-chain governance process, while mainly for the purposes of gathering community sentiment, also automatizes the process of testing and ultimately rolling out software upgrades on the blockchain.  Rather than requiring users to manually upgrade computer servers – called nodes – in the Tezos network, the upgrade is pushed to all bakers at a specified block number.  ""It's similar to how Constantinople happened at a given time,"" explained Jacob Arluck from the Tocqueville Group – a for-profit business development entity funded by the Tezos Foundation – to CoinDesk. ""But instead of everyone updating their software, [the upgrade] gets pushed to everyone's computers.""  Speaking to what could be improved in future for Tezos' self-amendment process, Breitman added that more could be done to strengthen communication about vote proposals ""off-chain.""  ""Some confusion about the proposals highlighted the need for better off-chain governance rules prior to ratification of an amendment,"" Breitman told CoinDesk. ""One thing I've learned in the process is that it's more enlightening to look at the ratification of an amendment as a decentralized oracle for existing consensus than as a voting mechanism per se.""  Additionally, in future, the robustness of this governance process will likely be tested as more polarizing proposals are input into the system.  As Andrew Paulicek, founder of HappyTezos – another public Tezos baking service – told CoinDesk:  ""I think people will be more inclined to change bakers in case there will be two very different proposals.""
