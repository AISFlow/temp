It's no secret cars have become more connected, but a new concept from a trio of big-name institutions is taking today's futuristic ideas further with a new blockchain prototype that envisions how transportation could be driven by automated payments.  That's the vision behind a new blockchain project called Car eWallet, developed jointly by German auto parts maker ZF Friedrichshafen, the innogy Innovation Hub (a spin-off of german utility giant RWE) and Swiss Bank UBS.  Car eWallet, announced earlier this month, is envisioned as an elaborate network for electric vehicles, one in which cars would pay for tolls, parking spaces and electrical charging via machine-to-machine transactions – all with a blockchain network at its core.  As explained by innogy decentralized technology lead Carsten Stocker at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) earlier this month, the idea is to marry a number of ideas to facilitate the development of automotive networks.  It starts, according to Stocker, with the vehicle itself.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It's an autonomous car. The cars can make the decisions, where to charge, what kind of lease it uses, what kind of service. The idea is it can independently interact with the services.""  The Car eWallet would be embedded in the car's electronic control unit (ECU) and connected to a private blockchain. The wallet would then be pre-loaded via a computer or smartphone application, which would allow transactions between users.  Nodes, in turn, would be placed in charging stations, facilitating and securing the network.  Apart from charging or parking, the companies explained, such wallets could even be how ridesharing firms come to transact with their customers in the years ahead, he said.  Elements of design  While this may sound like another far-fetched use of blockchain, Stocker disagrees.  To him, the idea utilizes core features of a blockchain network that make it an ideal technology for this use case. For one, he said, it allows for a decentralized system, meaning that it can include a wide network of users, some of whom don't necessarily have trusted relationships.  Stocker explained that gas station users who pay in cash today have an untrusted relationship with the station, a relationship that could be recreated on a blockchain.  ""It's about economically viable nano-transactions. It's about secure business logic, there's no credit risks in terms of the transactions,"" he said.  Likewise, each partner on the network will contribute a unique function to the whole project.  UBS, Stocker said, is looking more deeply at the customer experience, while ZF is handling application of the technology within the vehicle, and innogy is seeking to answer questions about connecting IoT (Internet of Things) devices to the blockchain itself.  This includes notable challenges, like examining how text changes to a smart contract may be adjusted on the wider network (a strong area of focus for many enterprises entering 2017) and also the handling of taxation and regulatory requirements.  User convenience  Stocker sees the concept as more than a novel technology being developed for the sake of it.  A main feature of the idea is convenience. Users can customize the amount of money that the eWallet can spend automatically, allowing drivers to save time and avoid some some of the hassles often encountered while driving.  ""For example, on the morning drive to the office, the car will automatically pay a toll, thus saving the driver the trouble of waiting in line at a tollbooth,"" ZF stated in a press release.  ""The driver is then notified while still in transit and the user receives updates online of every payment transaction made by the Car eWallet.""  Another problem that ZF hopes to solve is the sometimes convoluted payment systems at electric vehicle charging stations.  The company notes that different charging stations use varying forms of payment, such as using their own charge cards. However, the eWallet has the potential to standardize payments, automatically transferring funds while the car is plugged in.  Momentum building  Right now, the effort is being piloted and tested on a private blockchain, but Stocker hinted that a larger, consortium blockchain could be forthcoming.  Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), or firms that build car components for another company, could be among the participants in broader testing, he suggested.  While this may sound far-fetched, Stocker said it's an idea whose time is soon to come, citing as evidence Project Oaken – an ethereum blockchain app designed to be integrated into a Tesla vehicle, thereby allowing drivers to pay for tolls.  Other recent news events, he argued, are building momentum for the idea in the auto industry, including an acquisition by car maker Daimler AG that found it purchasing a digital payments company that also offers bitcoin services.  Stocker said:  ""It's clearly on the agenda.""

42427306,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1F7h,1485090120,Blockchain for Journalism: How a Big Funding Idea is Starting Small,"Journalism funding is in crisis. As the industry shifts to digital and its meagre click-based ad revenues, something in the model needs to change if quality news sources are to survive.      Alternatives are emerging, however.      New attention, for example, is being paid to alternatives to traditional ad models. Major publishers including Time and The New York Times are increasingly keen on accessing the feasibility of micropayments models.      Amidst the rising demand for blockchain projects, the two ideas are now becoming more intertwined.      CoinDesk recently inked a partnership with bitcoin-powered browser called Brave. The startup is seeking to take significant steps towards implementing a cross-platform micropayment system for news content – an idea that has been mooted since the 2000s and before, but never implemented.      Less well-known is another more niche use of cryptocurrency as a new media strategy: the issuance and trading of custom tokens as a way to raise funds, reward audience engagement and grant privileged access to premium content.      This technique is already being pioneered by bloggers and blockchain enthusiasts on a smaller scale.      Koji Higashi, author of the Japanese language Coin And Peace blog, went so far as to create a custom token – CNPCoin – using a blockchain protocol called Counterparty. He is now distributing the token to readers who comment on his blog or share its links on social media.      Higashi explained the idea:      ""Say I write an article, update my blog and tweet about it. If someone retweets it I follow up and say, 'You retweeted my article – if you can create a Counterparty wallet and tell me your address, I can give you X amount of my coin.'""            Valued content    The attention received from this idea has helped Higashi to bootstrap the blog, even though the token had no real-world value at first.      However, as readership and interest in the blog grew, he started to create premium content that could only be accessed by readers holding more than a certain amount of CNPCoin.      From then on, CNPCoin started to take on a demonstrable value as an access token, which let Higashi move into the next phase: setting up a system where readers could tip him in bitcoin if they enjoyed his blog posts – and receive CNPCoin in exchange.      “It started off as a pure experiment, just to see what would happen, but I actually got quite a lot of tips from it,"" Higashi said.      Higashi said one unknown reader even tipped him 1 BTC, a significant amount no matter when it might have been sent over the last few years.    The cost of 'free'    The idea has other proponents as well.      As an early mover in the field of using tokens as a media promotion strategy, Adam B Levine, CEO of Tokenly and creator of the ""Lets Talk Bitcoin!"" podcast, began distributing a currency token called LTBCoin to contributors and participants of the LTB network in 2014.      Levine said that underpinning LTBCoin was an initial idea that whatever is valuable in the currency ecosystem should be rewarded with a payout, but this could extend beyond the process of mining, the method by which contributors to the bitcoin protocol earn for participation.      ""I realized that if you didn't need to pay miners, you could reward people for other things. So, in our case that was podcasting, commenting, participating in the forums,” he said.      Each week, new LTBCoins are created and distributed, up to a limit of 510 million coins over a total time span of 260 weeks.      But rather than computational hash solving, 'mining' is done through content creation, audience participation and platform development.      LTBCoin has been popular with the show's following (as product marketers have long known, giving any kind of free tokens or coupons is a great way to build interest), but in some cases it can also be a double-edged sword.      ""What we learned from the rewards programme is that it's hard to get people to value something when they're used to getting it for free,"" said Levine.      The initial problem was that LTBCoin was trying to create value, while being perceived as 'free money', he said.      Levine explained that some recipients of the coin, particularly those based in poorer countries, would try to immediately sell up on exchanges, creating a negative feedback loop that depressed the value for other holders of the coin who wanted to keep a vested stake.      To combat this, it became clear that what was needed was a supporting ecosystem that allowed coins to be used in a broader range of settings than just direct monetary exchange.      Levine said:      ""At first we couldn’t do e-commerce with it, we couldn’t do anything with it ... Over time, that's what I've spent the last several years of my life doing, building out the infrastructure and the different end user applications that you can easily make tokens valuable in.""              In practice, that meant developing services like Swapbot, a system that creators of a custom token can use for automatically issuing and redeeming tokens against other forms of cryptocurrency (an example is the Tokenly bot).      But even with additional services, developing a community token is fraught with problems.    Recently, LTBCoin holders were disappointed by the decision of Poloniex to delist the coin from its exchangehttps://letstalkbitcoin.com/forum/post/ltbcoin-delisting-from-poloniex due to low trade volume, adding more friction to the process of conversion to and from other cryptocurrencies.  Bigger picture    For media producers outside of specialist cryptocurrency circles, distributing custom currency tokens is unlikely to be a big revenue stream for now.      The fact of the matter is that cryptocurrency as a whole remains obscure to much of the mainstream media – as an illustration, consider that even in a time of declining revenue, most major news organizations have not made any progress toward accepting bitcoin donations.      But success stories from solo entrepreneurs like Koji Higashi suggest that tokens could be a better fit for independent bloggers or small networks, which are often more open to experimentation beyond conventional channels.      Cryptocurrency alone won’t provide a big enough patch for holes in revenue left by the decline of print publishing, but it’s still one of many possible income streams that have been underexploited by the mainstream so far.      As with many applications of blockchain tech, time may tell how it will come to fruition.
