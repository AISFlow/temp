42382262,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r2vX,1562105612,4 US Lawmakers Join Call to Freeze Facebook's Libra Project,"U.S. lawmakers are formally calling on Facebook to cease all development of its Libra cryptocurrency in a new letter sent to executives at the social media giant.  Democrats from the U.S. House of Representatives wrote an open letter to Facebook Tuesday, calling on a moratorium to all libra development while the Financial Services Committee and affiliated subcommittees hold hearings to determine how it would operate and what protections would be implemented to protect user privacy.  Representatives Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee; Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Chair of the Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets Subcommittee; William Lacy Clay (D-MO), Chairman of the Housing, Community Development and Insurance Subcommittee; Al Green (D-TX), Chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee; and Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA), Chairman of the Task Force on Financial Technology all signed onto the letter, which was addressed to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, COO Sheryl Sandberg and Calibra CEO David Marcus.  Waters has repeatedly called on Facebook to pause development of libra, though this is the first time she has done so as part of a formal letter to the company.  The letter described concerns with Facebook's track record, a well as the potential for libra to act as a new global currency system.  ""It appears that these products may lend themselves to an entirely new global financial system that is based out of Switzerland and intended to rival U.S. monetary policy and the dollar. This raises serious privacy, trading, national security, and monetary policy concerns for not only Facebook’s over 2 billion users, but also for investors, consumers, and the broader global economy,"" the lawmakers wrote, adding:  ""While Facebook has published a 'white paper' on these projects, the scant information provided about the intent, roles, potential use, and security of the Libra and Calibra exposes the massive scale of the risks and the lack of clear regulatory protections. If products and services like these are left improperly regulated and without sufficient oversight, they could pose systemic risks that endanger U.S. and global financial stability. These vulnerabilities could be exploited and obscured by bad actors, as other cryptocurrencies, exchanges, and wallets have been in the past.""  Privacy concerns  The letter references recent privacy issues involving Facebook, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal, where a political consulting firm gained access to the data of more than 50 million Facebook users. Facebook is already expecting to pay a $5 billion fine to the Federal Trade Commission as a result of its involvement with Cambridge Analytica, and remains under a consent decree ""for deceiving consumers and failing to keep consumer data private.  ""Because Facebook is already in the hands of a over quarter of the world’s population, it is imperative that Facebook and its partners immediately cease implementation plans until regulators and Congress have an opportunity to examine these issues and take action,"" the letter said. ""During this moratorium, we intend to hold public hearings on the risks and benefits of cryptocurrency-based activities and explore legislative solutions. Failure to cease implementation before we can do so, risks a new Swiss-based financial system that is too big to fail.""  Libra was first unveiled in June, though the social media giant was rumored to have been developing it for months. The company lined up 27 launch partners, including crypto exchange Coinbase, and intends to have at least 100 members for the Libra Association, which will act as the cryptocurrency's governing council, when the token goes live.  The House Financial Services Committee has already scheduled a hearing to examine libra on July 17, a day after the Senate Banking Committee is set to hold its own hearing.  Since the project's formal announcement, regulators and government entities worldwide have expressed caution or alarm, with members of the G7 forming a task force to look into the project and various ministers calling for Facebook to share more details, or otherwise cease development.  Libra briefing  The letter comes days after Facebook reportedly briefed Congressional aides about the project.  In a contributed piece to liberal political and public policy magazine The American Prospect, an anonymous House Democratic aide wrote that the legislative aides met with Libra's head of policy (left unnamed, but presumably Dante Disparte), who outlined different aspects of the project, including Facebook's aim to have libra go live by next year and to maintain its value using a basket of fiat currencies.  According to the Prospect article, Facebook's representatives ""kept suggesting"" that the 2020 launch target was ""prolonged,"" meaning conservative, though other participants in the room did not agree with this assessment.  Other topics ranged from how libra would be regulated – ""Facebook said that they assumed the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) or the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) would regulate Libra"" – to how exactly the stablecoin's peg would operate.  Indeed, the staffer wrote:  ""They kept selling Libra as a means of providing banking services to 1.7 billion unbanked people around the world. When challenged on how they were going to do that, and asked directly whether they’d figure out how exactly a digital currency would be an answer for people who can’t access credit currently, they said, 'The short answer is no.' The phrase 'the miracle of blockchain' was used at one point.""  Sensitive data  The Congressional staffers present at the briefing also apparently asked what information Facebook would have if users transferred libra using WhatsApp or Messenger, two of the instant messaging apps Facebook owns and operates.  ""We were assured that ... Facebook would not access specific information about [users'] transactions beyond that they were interested in or using Libra,"" the author wrote. ""That would, of course, be enough information to know a lot more about the users.""  Staffers were also concerned with how Facebook could prevent its governing council partners from colluding with each other, though the response appeared to be that ""the partners were well aware of the 'reputational risks' they might incur should they violate privacy laws, etc.""  ""It was also pointed out that some of the partners are direct competitors, as if that has ever prevented them from colluding in the past,"" the aide wrote.

In a letter  posted by Public Citizen, the group details a list of issues they have with Facebook's cryptocurrency. The more than 30 signers include the Center for Digital Democracy, Consumer Reports, and the Service Employees International Union.  ""We call on Congress and regulators to impose a moratorium on Facebook’s Libra and related plans until the profound questions raised by the proposal are addressed,"" they write, echoing similar demands by House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters. Her panel and its Senate counterpart are scheduled to hold hearings on Libra this month.  Primarily liberal-leaning, these groups are concerned with the effect Libra will have on the world economy, especially in the lives of the unbanked. The signers are also concerned with the currency's governance and its effect on national sovereignty, asking questions like ""What impact might Libra have on monetary policy in smaller and developing countries?""  The questions, though thorough, suggest the writers are unaware of the extent to which cryptocurrency business already comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) regulations.  For example, the group asks:  ""Wouldn’t Libra provide an easy mechanism for money laundering? Would the Libra Association apply the anti-money laundering rules imposed by many nations? Would its technology even permit 'know your customer' type standards? Will all wallet providers be required to adhere to such rules? Should a private association be in the business of applying such standards?""  ""We have too much recent experience with insufficiently regulated financial markets spinning out of control to let this happen again,"" the consumer groups add, likely referring to the 2008 crash. ""The Facebook proposal must be put on hold until these numerous and fundamental questions are resolved.""  Obviously, this is not a binding document, but that these groups – and their associated constituencies – are concerning themselves with Libra shows just how far Facebook's tendrils are reaching into daily life.

Although Facebook reportedly spoke with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), executive director of strategy and competition Christopher Woolard raised a few points of contention about the social media company’s efforts to introduce a frictionless, global tender through the Libra network by June 2020.  Libra’s “size and scale will pose questions for society and government more generally about what is acceptable and desirable in this space,” Woolard said, according to Reuters.  “Historically, this may have been a sector that has lived by the mantra of ‘move fast and break things,’ but the issues raised here require deep thought and detail,” he said. Woolard's thrust being that Facebook's infamous policy of moving quick to gain market dominance and sabotaging competitors is not an acceptable strategy when deploying global financial services.  The 28 corporate and non-governmental backers of Libra maintain that they are attempting to expand financial access to the global unbanked population, or, to essentially make it as easy to move money as it is to share a photograph on Facebook's ecosystem.  The regulatory agency Woolard represents is said to take take digital assets into consideration singularly, rather than as representing an entire asset class, in order to determine the individual market effects on competition and consumers.  “It is crucial that we also think about the reality – the technical details, the technology; and the legal position,"" he said, referring to Libra.  From the viewpoint of consumers, the agency will consider such things as the harm done by increasing transactional complexity and the potential for exploitation, if applicable. The agency’s other mandate – to protect competition – will determine the effects on market integrity as well as how Libra may impact competitive entry. The FCA also reserves the right to introduce fees to dissuade monopolistic behavior.  Announced on June 18, Libra has already seen a mounting regulatory effort against it, with financial and governmental authorities the world over calling for close scrutiny of the project.

The firm partnered with OpenSC, a blockchain platform, to develop the distributed ledger system which will be separate and distinct from Nestlé’s ongoing participation with IBM Food Trust blockchain.  The pilot will last six months, and success will be determined by the “feasibility, viability and scalability of the system,” as well as how well the system verifies data, according to a Nestlé representative. Once rolled out, the service may involve a QR code, mobile app, and web portal.  “For us, it is key that the access to the information is as seamless and easy as possible in order to have participation and traction with stakeholders and consumers,” the spokesperson said.  The company said the initiative is to drive the market towards transparency by providing independently verifiable data to the conglomerate’s consumers. They also believe the mechanism will improve food safety and quality control.  “We want our consumers to make an informed decision on their choice of products – to choose products produced responsibly. Open blockchain technology might allow us to share reliable information with consumers in an accessible way,” said Magdi Batato, Nestlé Executive Vice President in a statement.  The program will initially track milk from farms in New Zealand to Nestlé facilities in the Middle East, and will expand to include palm oil production in the Americas. Nestlé will then determine how scalable the application is, noting that some retail items will take time to integrate.  “With the palm oil supply chain in the America, we can experiment the system at local level. Furthermore, the product itself, being liquid, it adds more complexity to the traceability,” a company representative said to CoinDesk.  The data will be collected through each step of the value chain and recorded on an open platform. The company may plan to include data from other monitoring systems, such as satellite imaging of farms, according to the company representative.  “With the open platform, any update or change made in the system can be seen by all users as it retains the original data, which cannot be deleted,” they said.  Nestlé began experimenting with blockchain in 2017 when it joined IBM Food Trust as a founding member. In April, Nestlé announced that it had begun working with Carrefour to use blockchain to track Mousline potato puree from Nestlé factories to the French retail giant’s stores.  In June, Carrefour attributed an increase in sales to its use of transparent tracking.  “We want to offer consumers what they want. Consumers are more and more demanding for information related to their food. They are eager to understand where the ingredients come from, whether it has been sourced responsibly and how the food is made. Blockchain helps provide consumers trusted data collected throughout the value chain,” said the spokesperson.  “This open blockchain technology will allow anyone, anywhere in the world to assess our responsible sourcing facts and figures,” said Benjamin Ware, Global Head of Responsible Sourcing for Nestlé.  IBM Blockchain uses a QR barcode on a product that when scanned provides information such as date of harvest, farm location and owner, packing date, how long the item in transport, and tips on how to prepare it.

42382268,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r2lT,1562093106,Ethereum Leaders Are Slowly Courting Persian Gulf Royals and Investors,"Ethereum’s leaders are pursuing a “moonshot” in the Middle East.  The Ethereum Foundation’s head of special projects, Virgil Griffith, told CoinDesk the nonprofit is partnering with finance experts in the Persian Gulf to show that the world’s second largest blockchain is compatible with Islamic law. Islamic finance customs adhere to certain beliefs, including the prohibition of earning interest on loaned funds.  The move is seen as a first step toward potentially securing investment from the region’s plutocrats.  “My job is to keep rolling dice,” Griffith told CoinDesk about work to certify ethereum’s Sharia compliance. “Probably nothing will happen. But there’s a hypothetical case where say, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund invests, like, a trillion dollars [in ethereum projects], which would be a real boon. That would be really great.”  Wan Hafizi Halim, an Islamic finance expert at Amanie Advisors in Dubai, told CoinDesk his firm issued a paper saying ethereum smart contracts can be halal, or compliant with Islamic banking rules. Wan Hafizi said the research was conducted at the behest of the Ethereum Foundation, which is spearheaded by ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin.  “What we did with ethereum was just to provide the guidelines,” Wan Hafizi told CoinDesk. “Any companies that wish to fundraise in Muslim countries, they can also approach Sharia scholars to assess their projects to see if they are compliant from end-to-end. … With the Sharia certification they obtain, that could provide some clarities and convince Muslim investors to participate and invest.”  Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF)https://www.pif.gov.sa/style%20library/pifprograms/PIF%20Program_EN.pdf, led by controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reportedly manages investments worth $300 billion. Griffith called this certification effort a “moonshot” with high upside if it works and low downside if it doesn’t. Yet it may not be far-fetched to imagine Middle Eastern royals investing in ethereum projects.  A cryptocurrency trader in Saudi Arabia with knowledge of the local regulatory authorities, who asked to remain anonymous because trading is currently forbidden in the Kingdom, told CoinDesk that Saudi leaders are interested in using ethereum for “national projects that will help the economy.”  “Most blockchain development here happens on ethereum,” he said. “People are still pretty cautious and only testing things out.”  ConsenSys ties  In the meantime, venture studio ConsenSys, which is led by ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, has been establishing connections with governments in the Persian Gulf as well.  PIF, the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, has been in touch with ConsenSys, according to a source with knowledge of the matter. Still, it remains to be seen if Saudi royals will invest directly in any ethereum project.  ConsenSys also confirmed that talks with the PIF explored opportunities to invest in ConsenSys through the purchase of equity as part of the company's effort to raise $200 million in venture capital.  ConsenSys has existing projects in the region outside of Saudi Arabia. In Dubai, ConsenSys partnered with local authorities on plans to help Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum make Dubai ""the first city fully powered by blockchain by 2021."" Through a partnership with the Emirates Integrated Telecommunications Companyhttps://content.consensys.net/wp-content/uploads/dus-BPaaS-based-Use-Cases-Lead-the-Blockchain-Technology-Revolution-in-the-UAE.pdf, ConsenSys explored opportunities for digital permits and an automated “process of attesting any document by governmental entities.”  Rami Maalouf, the ConsenSys director leading efforts in the Middle East and North Africa, told CoinDesk there are currently 30 staff members in Dubai working on Smart Dubai projects, which are scheduled for launch by the end of 2019.  ""Several conversations are underway with both private- and public-sector players in Dubai and the Gulf Cooperation Council as well,"" Maalouf said. ""The traction we are seeing is very encouraging as the understanding and appetite for investment in blockchain technology is accelerating.""  Ethereum Foundation liaison Atif Yaqub, partner at the London-based crypto and real estate firm UKP Assets, told CoinDesk that ConsenSys isn’t involved in his current partnership with Amanie Advisors to develop an ethereum platform for issuing Sharia-compliant financial products and services.  Yaqub’s project, which he plans to spin out into a separate startup later this year, involves cooperation with the foundation and Griffith’s blockchain industry contacts but is not currently funded by the EF. Regardless, Yaqub said the work he’s doing with Griffith could benefit other startups, including Lubin’s ConsenSys investments, down the road.  “An Islamic institute or a government, if they were to engage and create a product, first they would look to see about this ethereum thing, what is it? Is it permissible for us to use within our structure? That part is already there,” Yaqub said, adding:  “If they [Muslim leaders] were to engage with ConsenSys, or anybody … if there’s already an ecosystem, or somebody developing a [compliant] ecosystem, it’s much easier for them to engage.”  Update (July 3, 17:10 UTC): This article was updated to include statements from ConsenSys.

Though approved by the UK watchdog, the firm will abide by European regulations. Under these guidelines the firm will be allowed to hold more than 100 million euros in assets under management. It is the first agency to be approved to invest exclusively in the cryptocurrency asset class.  The founders believe that by focusing on a single asset class, even one that carries market distrust, they will surge ahead of their global competitors and become the trusted authority in crypto investing.  “Most vehicles for investing in cryptocurrencies are outside the scope of regulators and that’s a big problem in a market that has such a bad reputation,” Adam Grimsley, Prime Factor’s chief operating officer, told Bloomberg.  Prime Factor is required to appoint a custodian under EU regulations to ensure and validate investors’ returns and the fund’s holdings.

Bitfinex borrowed as much as $700 million from the stablecoin issuer through a line of credit in early 2019, according to legal filings by the New York Attorney General (NYAG)'s office. The exchange needed the cash to make up for an $850 million hole which resulted from its payment processor, Crypto Capital, having its funds seized by authorities in three separate nations.  On Tuesday, the exchange said it had transferred $100 million from its account to Tether's.  ""Bitfinex made this payment in fiat wired to Tether’s bank account,"" the announcement read. ""This amount was not yet due to be paid to Tether under the facility, but Bitfinex has made the prepayment based upon its financial position at the end of the second quarter of 2019.""  ""Also on July 1st, Bitfinex fully prepaid all interest accrued under the loan facility to Tether up to the end of day on June 30, 2019, also in fiat,"" the exchange added.  Bitfinex and Tether have long shared key executives and shareholders, though both companies maintain that they are distinct entities. Tether's USDT token, which usually trades around $1, is supposed to be backed 1-for-1 with U.S. dollars or cash equivalents, but the Bitfinex loan meant a portion of that collateral was replaced with the debt of an affiliated company.  Legal battle  IFinex, Bitfinex's parent firm, and other affiliated entities are embroiled in a legal fight with the NYAG's office over the alleged cover-up of its $850 million loss.  The company has filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the NYAG has neither the jurisdiction nor sufficient evidence to back up its claims.  The NYAG's office has until July 8 to file its opposition, and iFinex and its affiliated companies will be able to file their own response by July 22.

42382255,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r2nz,1562076033,Gemini to Apply for Broker-Dealer License in Bid to Trade Crypto Securities,"The Winklevoss-owned cryptocurrency exchange Gemini will apply for a broker-dealer license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), CoinDesk has learned.  This is the first step toward becoming an approved Alternative Trading System, where customers can lawfully swap digital securities.  Gemini previously partnered with the tokenized securities platform Harbor, which allows institutional investors to buy securities with Gemini’s GUSD stablecoin and to also receive dollar-denominated dividends via GUSD. It stands to reason that Gemini would also want to facilitate the trading of such securities on its own platform.  In February, Harbor CEO Joshua Stein told CoinDesk that brokers, family offices and investment banks are still “interested at a significant level” in tokens, even though the more stringent regulatory climate subdued 2017’s broader market frenzy. So far, the platform has focused on the potential for fractionalized real estate and startup equity, though it's sole real-estate deal fell through in April.  “The [Gemini] team is very easy to work with and we are aligned in terms of taking a proactive regulatory approach and addressing the needs of the institutional players in the market,” Harbor’s marketing lead, Kevin Young, told CoinDesk.  A source with knowledge of Gemini’s operations told CoinDesk the plan is to permit securities from external platforms such as Harbor to eventually trade on Gemini. However, winning the necessary approvals may take time.  FINRA has so far appeared reticent to approve broker-dealer applications by companies interacting with cryptocurrencies, even as security tokens. The self-regulatory organization is reportedly sitting on roughly 40 applications for these approvals, with companies waiting as long as 14 months. Only time will tell if Gemini will also become a trading platform for tokenized securities.  Gemini is already a qualified on a state-level to custody digital assets, an approval the company received in 2015 through the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).

CipherTrace is teaming up with Shyft, a firm developing blockchain-based identity and attestation platform, on the initiative, which the firms say is planned to enable compliance with the FATF ""Travel Rule,"" while still maintaining user privacy.  Specifically, according to an announcement Tuesday, the firms will build know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) ecosystem ""in which participating exchanges can securely transfer Proof of Knowledge without disclosing personally identifying information.""  FATF announced in late June that it had finalized its recommendations on regulating cryptocurrencies for its 37 member countries.  The new standards included a controversial requirement that “virtual asset service providers,” including crypto exchanges, pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms. FATF gave member countries 12 months to adopt the guidelines, with a review set for June 2020.  Currently, crypto exchanges lack a compliant way to share KYC data or alert other firms over suspicious activity, according to the release.  To address that shortfall, CipherTrace and Shyft will launch a pilot program to develop a ""shared smart-contract and cryptographic access controls"" allowing cryptocurrency exchanges to manage access to users' private details.  The ultimate aim is to make KYC and AML ""faster, more efficient and open,"" while maintaining a ""high level of privacy."" The solution would only reveal identity information when ""compelled to do so by legal authorities,"" the firms said.  CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans said:  “With cryptographically controlled privacy mechanisms, it is possible to have both anonymity and responsible disclosure of the source of funds for legitimate purposes such as criminal or terrorist investigations and AML compliance. This is the direction that CipherTrace is working on for the future growth of cryptocurrencies globally. We believe that there are technological and regulatory solutions that can preserve privacy while enabling security and compliance.”  Paper people image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/02/blockchain-solution-for-fatf-travel-rule-to-keep-user-data-private,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22704ba8362cf2fede1a55987e9f52fe48dcc1cd-1500x872.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Huobi said:  ""Among other applications, the project will have the potential to host lending services, debit services, stablecoins, security token offerings (STOs) and other means of asset issuance, decentralized exchanges (DEXs), real-world payment services, and more.""  For the tech side of initiative, the firm is teaming up with blockchain network Nervos, which offers a base proof-of-work blockchain, over which sits a protocol layer aimed to support scaling and other solutions.  The joint project will be made open source, and will provide support for multiple assets, as well as smart contracts, allowing third-party developers to ""build and deploy a wide range of DeFi services."" Also support will be multi- and side-chain architectures.  Kevin Wang, co-founder of Nervos, said:  ""The recent wave of high-profile blockchain projects from traditional institutions such as Libra and JPM Coin is a sign of a bigger shift looming in the financial services industry. As more financial institutions and enterprises realize the potential of blockchain technology, we want to provide the secure and trust-driven infrastructure they'll need to issue their own decentralized assets and deploy DeFi services in a compliant and ""low risk"" environment.""  ""This project is an important undertaking for Nervos because of the sheer impact it will have. Not only will decentralized finance transform the way we bank and improve access for millions of the unbanked, but it will also accelerate blockchain adoption into the mainstream,"" he added.  Aimed to be ""regulator-friendly,"" Huobi Finance Chain will also support decentralized identifier (DID) and offer identity protocols such as know-your-customer (KYC) verification to allow projects to comply with anti-money laundering rules. Huobi is further enabling regulators to contribute to the network as validators.  The open source code is expected to be made available in Q3 2019, followed by a testnet launch in Q1 2020 and a full mainnet launch in the second quarter.  Leon Li, CEO and founder of Huobi Group, said:  “The mission of Huobi Group is to make finance more efficient and make wealth accessible to all. This project is not only in line with Huobi's overall strategy, but it also fulfills our core mission. From a strategic point of view, decentralized financial services are still in an early stage of development.

Over the course of last year, IBM’s TradeLens struggled to sign up Maersk’s competitors; as CoinDesk reported, rival carriers were put off by IBM and Maersk essentially owning the platform.  One way or another, those concerns seem to have dissipated as far as competing shipping lines are concerned. TradeLens now boasts 15 ocean carrier lines, including ZIM, KMTC, Safmarine, Sealand, Seaboard Marine, Namsung, Boluda and APL.  Todd Scott, vice president of supply chain solution sales at IBM Blockchain, said a lot of work had gone into getting the governance right, ensuring data privacy, publishing APIs, and aligning with common standards, known to the shipping and supply chain industry.  Asked if there had been any other fundamental changes to the ownership of the platform, Scott told CoinDesk:  “The ownership has not changed. TradeLens is still a jointly-owned product, asset, IP etc between IBM and Maersk. That has not changed at all.”  In a statement, Martin Gnass, managing director information technology at Hapag-Lloyd, said: “TradeLens has made significant progress in launching a much-needed transformation in the industry, including its partnership model.”  A spokesman for Hapag-Lloyd told CoinDesk via email:    “Concerning TradeLens, we (like other major carriers) were not happy with the initial governance model proposed by IBM and Maersk. In the meantime, they have changed their approach and made it acceptable for us (and other major carriers like CMA CGM, MSC) to participate in the platform.”    The spokesman said he could not comment on the details of the new approach as they are “commercially confidential”.  Pilot fishing  Scott offered another theory behind Tradelens’s recent growth spurt.  He said players in the shipping and logistics world may have kicked the tires of other proposed solutions and seen that IBM’s Blockchain Platform (built on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain foundation) offered the best results.  “There were some other projects that I think that some of the carriers had engaged in that may not have produced the same kind of results [as TradeLens]. So I think that may have played a role as well,” said Scott.  An obvious example of this could be the shipping blockchain pilot run by Accenture, which included Singapore-based shipping carrier APL (American President Lines, 12th largest by cargo volume) and freight forwarding giant Kuehne + Nagel.  APL and its parent company CMA CGM have both now chosen to join TradeLens. (Neither CMA CMG, APL nor Accenture replied to requests for comment by press time.)  Now that IBM’s major supply chain distributed ledgers – Walmart-backed Food Trust and TradeLens – are both live and processing a ton of data, when will the effort start pay off with revenues for Big Blue?  “The expectation is that we will start to turn the corner on this,” Scott said. “Without getting into specifics and timing, we believe that as the ecosystem sees value, commercialization will come – certainly in the not too distant future.”  Shipping port image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/02/ibm-maersk-shipping-blockchain-gains-steam-with-15-carriers-now-on-board,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/755bc1ae40f9fb3b8941af3c07f0ef85a0184da3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382267,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r31p,1562058044,Bitcoin Price Dips Below $10K With Deeper Losses Likely,"View  Bitcoin has dropped below $10,000 for the first time in 11 days, reinforcing the buyer exhaustion signaled by the weekly chart, as discussed yesterday.  The daily chart indicators have turned bearish, while the 4-hour chart is reporting a bearish lower-highs, lower-lows pattern. As a result, the price could slip further toward the former resistance-turned-support of $9,097 (May 30 high) in the next couple of days.  A UTC close below $9,097 would invalidate the bullish setup on the daily chart.  A high-volume break above the falling trendline on the 4-hour chart, currently at $11,100, would shift risk in favor of retest of the recent high of $13,880.      Bitcoin (BTC) was trading below $10,000 on exchanges for the first time in 11 days on Tuesday morning (UTC), and may face further losses ahead.  The top cryptocurrency by market value hit a low of $9,713 at 06:00 UTC – a level last seen on June 21 – before regaining some ground. At time of writing, one BTC is worth $10,200, down around 7 percent on a 24-hour basis, as per Bitstamp prices.  The drop saw BTC retrace more than 30 percent of gains from its 17-month high of $13,880 hit on June 26, and more than 60 percent of the four-week rally from lows near $7,500.  Bitcoin's price drop is hurting the broader market as well. Only seven out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are reporting gains at press time, according to CoinMarketCap.  That said, most of the losers are outperforming bitcoin, which was the 11th worst performing top-100 cryptocurrency of the last 24 hours, at 09:00 UTC. For instance, EOS and bitcoin cash (BCH) were down 3 percent, while cryptos like ether (ETH) token and XRP reported 6 percent and 4.5 percent drops, respectively.  As a result, a majority of alternative cryptocurrencies are reporting gains in BTC terms. The cryptocurrency market performance of the last 24 hours indicates the investors have likely begun rotating money out of bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies.  With bitcoin's technical charts signaling scope for a deeper drop toward key support at $9,097, altcoins may continue to shine bright in BTC terms.  BTC daily chart  With the 5- and 10-day moving averages reporting a bearish crossover and the 14-day relative strength index reporting bearish conditions with a below-50 reading, bitcoin appears on track to test support at $9,097 (May 30 high).  Supporting the bearish case is the recent drop in the Chaikin money flow index from 0.37 to 0.13 – a decline indicating weakening buying pressure.  The outlook as per the daily chart would turn bearish if the cryptocurrency prints a UTC close below $9,097, violating the bullish higher-lows and higher-highs pattern.  The case for deeper losses would weaken if the price finds acceptance above the June 27 low of $10,300, although as of now that looks unlikely.  4-hour chart  The previous 4-hour candle closed well below $10,300 (see yellow line), confirming a bearish lower-highs and lower-lows pattern.  The breakdown is backed by high sell volume (red bars). In fact, sell volumes have been consistently higher than buy volumes ever since BTC topped out at $13,800. As a result, a drop toward $9,097 looks likely.  The Chaikin money flow has turned negative for the first time since June 10 – a sign the cryptocurrency is now facing increasing selling pressure.  The outlook would turn bullish if the price clears the descending trendline hurdle at $11,100 on the back of strong buy volumes. That would open the doors to a retest of the recent high of $13,880. After all, the long-term charts are still biased bullish.

42382264,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r2wn,1562054438,"'Disappointed' by Central Bank Blockchain, Russia's Largest Bank Eyes Alternatives","The Takeaway  Masterchain, a blockchain project backed by Russia's central bank, is falling behind on its goals two years after inception.  Sberbank, the leading bank in Russia, is unsatisfied with the system's speed, security and overall efficiency after testing it.  The bank is looking to shift its work to other enterprise platforms, Sberbank's blockchain lab head said.      Masterchain, the bank blockchain project developed under the auspices of the Russian central bank, is missing the mark, the project’s key participant told CoinDesk.  Sberbank, Russia's largest bank, has decided to wind down its participation in Masterchain, said Oleg Abdrashitov, head of the institution's blockchain lab. Calling the system inefficient, insecure and slow, Abdrashitov said his bank will shift its blockchain work to other, more widely used enterprise platforms.  ""Masterchain does not satisfy the requirements for Sberbank's use cases, so for all future exploration we will use enterprise blockchain platforms such as Hyperledger Fabric or Quorum,"" Abdrashitov said. To be clear: Sberbank will finish what it started with Masterchain, but won't initiate any new work.  In an interview last month, Abdrashitov offered a rare window into the discreet world of enterprise blockchain projects, where dissatisfied participants usually exit projects quietly. His candor is especially notable coming from such a large player: Sberbank commands a 50 percent share of the Russian mortgage market, the focus of Masterchain's initial use case.  Masterchain was launched in 2017 by the FinTech Association (AFT) — an entity itself founded that year by the Bank of Russia, the country’s central bank. The blockchain project had the support of the five largest banks in the country: Sberbank, Alfa Bank, VTB, Raiffeisenbank Russia (a subsidiary of the Austrian Raiffeisen) and Otkritie.  The cost of Masterchain's development is not public. However, according to earlier public disclosures, the 13 members of the Fintech Association are paying $120,000 to $230,000 a year to participate, which means the project may have burned through a couple million dollars over the last two years.  Neither the Bank of Russia nor the AFT responded to requests for comment by press time.  Launch delayed  Masterchain's trial use case – a decentralized depository system for digital mortgage bonds – makes a lot of sense for banks, Abdrashitov said. The National Settlement Depository (NSD) is charging a fraction of a percent of the value of every mortgage bond it’s keeping as a custodian, but for Sberbank it means millions of dollars every year.  A decentralized system, on the other hand, requires investment at the stage of building, but once working, it would be much cheaper to use, Abdrashitov said.  Just not this system.  For starters, the Masterchain mortgage pilot, started last fall, was supposed to go into production, or real-world deployment, next month, but it’s unlikely to be ready that soon due to slow technical development on the part of the FinTech Association, Abdrashitov said.  “We have not received a new release of the Decentralized Depository System from AFT yet and haven't tested it, so the proposed July start date is in question,” he said.  Eugenia Ovchinnikova, Raiffeisenbank Russia’s head of tech research and digital innovation, confirmed that there is no date for the production launch currently because Raiffeisen is ""closing infrastructure, legal and technical questions with AFT and inside the bank.""  Too centralized  Part of the problem, according to Abdrashitov, is that Masterchain is not, to borrow a phrase from U.S. regulators, sufficiently decentralized.  Supervised by the central bank, Masterchain is private and permissioned by design. In other words, the blockchain is visible only to participants and only approved parties can run a node to verify transactions, unlike bitcoin or ethereum, where the ledger is public and anyone can download the software.  That in itself wasn't an issue for Sberbank, but Masterchain became too centralized even for this format, Abdrashitov said, as ""its operation fully depends on the FinTech Association's central server that controls mining and consensus.""  Like ethereum, Masterchain requires participants to pay gas, or small amounts of the native digital currency, for transactions, which isn’t the case on the major enterprise platforms Sberbank is now gravitating toward.  But in Masterchain, tokens for paying gas are distributed by the association’s node, Abdrashitov said, and if Sberbank’s node needs more and starts mining itself, it gets switched off the network. Nobody ever explained to him why or by what principle this happened, he said.  Raiffeisen's Ovchinnikova said the tokens for paying gas have been distributed among participants for free, and the wallets are refilled from time to time automatically. However, she said, network participants don't have to rely on AFT for tokens, as they can share them with each other.  Slow and insecure  The system is also very slow, Abdrashitov said. One mortgage bond, in the form of a 30-kilobyte zip file, takes three minutes to upload into Masterchain.  ""Business people are not used to dealing with something where you push a button and then you go take a break [until it works],"" he said. ""The leadership is looking at that and gets disappointed in the blockchain tech. We are spending shareholders’ money [on blockchain exploration]. We need solutions that are practical.""  The reason for this sluggishness, according to Abdrashitov, is that Masterchain is basically public ethereum’s architecture put in a permissioned environment for a closed network of five participants.  Further, the system is not secure for a small network of just a handful of nodes, Abdrashitov said. ""Proof-of-work systems are good for thousands of participants, but if there are only five, it’s easy for one of them to rewrite the ledger.""  The product is so unreliable that when it enters the production phase, Sberbank plans to use both Masterchain and the legacy system, so that the experimental tech layer has a secure backup and the operation doesn’t collapse.  It also turned out that it’s impossible to use Masterchain for several purposes at once: for every use case, a new network has to be rolled out, Abdrashitov said. It’s frustrating the project is in such a condition, he said, as the system would be viable if the developers did just one thing from the very beginning: replace the proof-of-work consensus with an enterprise-friendly one.  Alternative options  Sberbank, which is about 50 percent owned by the Bank of Russia, is examining enterprise platforms like Hyperledger Fabric and Quorum (initially developed by IBM and JPMorgan, respectively) for future exploration of use cases like over-the-counter trading, trade finance, payments and mortgage lending, Abdrashitov said.  The bank has conducted several pilots on Fabric: it issued bond certificates for the Russian telecom company MTS; repurchase agreements, starting with one for the investment company Interros; and a trade finance project with electronics retail chain M-Video and its suppliers.  Raiffeisen is also trialing multiple platforms in parallel with Masterchain, Ovchinnikova said, including Fabric, R3'S Corda and Raiffeisenbank’s proprietary ethereum-based framework, dubbed R-chain. She wouldn't say whether the bank is prioritizing any platform.  As for Masterchain, Ovchinnikova sounded more sanguine than Abdrashitov about the initial setbacks, concluding:  “We’re ok with the fact that the very first trials of the new technologies don’t look close to what’s required on the production stage.""  Edit (13:16 UTC, July 2 2019): The original headline for this article overstated the situation by saying Sberbank was “quitting” Masterchain. Sberbank won’t initiate any new work with the project, but it will finish what it started.
