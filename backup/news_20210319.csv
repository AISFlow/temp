42406115,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerz4s,1616190541,Coinbase Settles With CFTC for $6.5M Over Old Trading Practices,"Crypto exchange Coinbase will pay $6.5 million in a settlement with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) over allegations the exchange “self-traded” digital assets.      According to a consent order published by the commodities regulator Friday, Coinbase self-traded a small amount of cryptocurrency between 2015 and 2018 through two of its automated trading programs. A now-former employee of the exchange also allegedly ""wash traded"" litecoin during that time period, as well.      One of these programs was designed to project how much of any given cryptocurrency Coinbase was expected to sell on its retail brokerage app. The system would then purchase the suggested amount of cryptocurrency through its professional trading division (GDAX, now known as Coinbase Pro) and hold it in the exchange’s treasury.      Self-trading is when “the same entity takes both sides of the trade,” a report by the U.S. Treasury Department and several financial regulators said in 2014. This type of market activity could be likened to wash trading, where an entity might artificially pump up the trading volume of an asset.      Importantly, the CFTC is not alleging that any Coinbase customers were harmed or that any wrongdoing occurred. Rather, it’s describing the activity as reckless but not intentional. This activity is no longer occurring, the CFTC said Friday.      Coinbase disclosed the investigation’s existence in its Form S-1, which the company filed ahead of its planned listing on Nasdaq.      The CFTC began investigating “trades made in 2017 by one of the company’s then-current employees,” according to the S-1. The investigation also included “the design and operation of certain algorithmic functions related to liquidity management on the company’s platform.”      While the CFTC has conducted other investigations into Coinbase, according to the S-1, including into an Ethereum “market event” and the bitcoin cash listing, this is the only investigation the exchange anticipated would have a “material adverse effect” on its operations.      In a concurrent statement published with the settlement, CFTC Commissioner Dawn Stump wrote that while she agreed with the regulator's findings, she wanted to ensure the public is aware that the CFTC doesn't regulate spot exchanges.      Coinbase doesn't offer any derivatives products and is therefore not registered with the agency, she wrote. The activity at the heart of Friday's enforcement action also doesn't affect any derivatives covered by the agency.      ""The settled charges are based largely on conduct that is several years old, has not been repeated, and in the case of the charge of secondary liability, is based on conduct by an employee who left Coinbase years ago and who is not being charged,"" she added.      In a statement shared with CoinDesk, a Coinbase spokesperson said the company neither admits nor denies the findings, but said the order does not find any Coinbase customers were harmed.      ""We believe clear, common-sense regulations are needed to provide a stable trading environment for all market participants. Because of this, we proactively engaged with the CFTC throughout their investigation, and we believe that our conversations were constructive and contributed to an outcome that is satisfactory for both parties,"" the spokesperson said.

Authors Raphael Auer, Philipp Haene and Henry Holden charted one road for cross-border CBDC finance in a detail-heavy research note. They offered a handful of potential mechanisms for multi-CBDC and took some pot shots at the public sector's inevitable competitor.      The biggest benefits will come only if countries collaborate to eliminate traditional banking frictions for their new, interoperable form of money, the BIS researchers said.      The paper balked at libra's (now diem's) plans to unite the digital payments world under a private entity's cross-border global stablecoin. Interoperable CBDCs ""are preferable"" to the Facebook-led Diem project, the authors said, arguing convertible national cryptos ""strengthen monetary sovereignty in the digital age"" while private cryptos would simply shift the cross-border risks elsewhere.      Nevertheless the paper's authors empathized with Diem's desire to simplify cross-border finances. They said an interoperable, central banker-approved system for switching disparate CBDCs about would do a better job.      First, they would have to convince central bankers that international collaboration on CBDC is worth the trouble. They foresee a long road ahead as few countries have finalized their digital currency plans and competing interests abound.      Central banks would have to coordinate on policy, technical standards, data requirements and regulation to establish a viable, linkable system. The authors pointed out that's easier said than done; establishing the euro payments system took years.    Read more: BIS Chief Blasts Bitcoin’s Viability, Prompting Blowback From Advocates    Monetary wonks could opt to build a ""common distributed ledger"" that houses multiple CBDCs. That's an even harder lift, though. Multi-currency systems, which typically presage currency unions, are historically tricky beasts made no simpler by thorny issues of governance and access that come with DLT (distributed ledger technology), a digital system of recording transactions in which transactions are recorded in multiple places at the same time.      The authors said central banks have an opportunity to collaborate on these issues before launching otherwise walled-off CBDC systems.

42406129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerzGg,1616185515,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Near $59K as Worries on Bond Yields Increase,"Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $58,882.38 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 2.52% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $56,327.79-$59,242.58 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price struggled to push higher after briefly touching $59,000 when markets opened in the U.S. on Friday.      Investors continued to monitor the potential fallout from U.S. Treasury bond yields, which some analysts warn could lead to a correction in risky assets from bitcoin to stocks.      The 10-year Treasury note yield went as high as 1.74% on Friday, the highest since January 2020, after the Federal Reserve signaled Wednesday it would keep loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future.      “If we continue to see the U.S. bond market questioning the Fed forward guidance, it could lead to more downside pressure in risk assets and start to weigh on bitcoin by extension,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. “We think this is a risk worth considering, especially with bitcoin already having moved so far and fast in 2021 thus far.”      Price charts also are sending signals the oldest cryptocurrency might be losing steam, with patterns appearing that suggest the market is reaching an overbought condition, according to analysts with Cryptowatch, a unit of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.      Read More: Bitcoin Price Gets Fed Boost but Bond Yields Could Play Spoilsport: Analysts      The Fed’s reaffirmation of its pledge to keep monetary policy loose theoretically should benefit bitcoin’s price in the short term. A growing number of investors are betting bitcoin might act as a hedge against inflation. Many Wall Street economists expect inflation will escalate once more people start going out and spur an economic recovery thanks to the coronavirus vaccine. But rising U.S. Treasury bond yields could create extra selling pressure for bitcoin along with traditional risky assets.      “If rates go higher, it will force investors to rethink their long equity exposure and could open a big sell-off in stocks,” Kruger said. “And as things stand in the short term, because bitcoin is still a maturing asset, it still shares correlations with risk sentiment. So bitcoin would be somewhat exposed if something like this played out.”      In the bitcoin derivatives market, options open interest remained high above $14 billion after reaching an all-time high on Wednesday.      It “indicates that this week’s price rally could be more speculative,” said Yves Renno, head of trading at Wirex, who also noted that the bitcoin December’s futures contract is currently quoted at a much higher price than bitcoin’s spot price.      Read More: Brazil Becomes Second Country in the Americas to Approve a Bitcoin ETF      “If there are no significant events that take place and shake the market again, such as new legislation that would favour the issuance of the first U.S. exchange-traded fund (ETF), or a new large tech player entering the crypto economy, then there seems to be very little fundamental support for a new bitcoin rally in the short-term,” Renno said.    Ether outperforms bitcoin as more BTCs are locked on Ethereum    Ether (ETH) was up on Friday, trading around $1,828.06 and climbing 3.20% in 24 hours as of 20:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Alternative coins (altcoins) tend to see more price action after bitcoin logs new record high prices.      That happens because some traders and investors try to rotate into altcoins when bitcoin isn’t popping, in pursuit of potentially higher returns.

The dynamic might hold if bitcoin stays in a bull market, the firm predicts.    “Bitcoin and the wider crypto market are the modern-age digital gold rush,” wrote FundStrat, which means crypto mining stocks could see further upside.  Because ""miners play such a critical role in ensuring the Bitcoin network functions properly, investors have sought opportunities to gain exposure to mining companies,” which generate revenue in the form of mined bitcoin.  The largest publicly listed mining companies include Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ: RIOT), Hive Blockchain (OTCMKTS: HVBTF), and Marathon Patent Group (NASDAQ: MARA).  As the bitcoin price increases, miners spin up new rigs or upgrade hardware in pursuit of higher block rewards. And FundStrat expects more-efficient mining machines will help some firms remain competitive, which could boost profit margins.

42406122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerzAm,1616178065,Artists Back 'Green' NFT Sale Citing Concerns Over Crypto's Environmental Impact,"This Saturday sees the first drop of “green” non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      A group of digital artists, including the scene’s leading celebrity, Beeple, will showcase a selection of blockchain-backed works that have been specially formatted so as to reduce their environmental footprint.      All proceeds from the CarbonDrop sale go towards the Open Earth Foundation, a project spun out of Yale University that uses a range of technologies, including blockchain, to begin to realistically account for carbon in our atmosphere.      This collaborative effort also involves input from RNDR, a system that incentivizes idle compute power to help render digital media effects like CGI, and Nifty Gateway, an NFT marketplace owned by Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss.      It has not taken long for the explosion of interest in NFTs (title deeds to certain digital artifacts created using shared ledgers) to spotlight the putative environmental impact associated with mining crypto tokens.      Within the cryptocurrency community, questions about the environmental damage caused by algorithmic mining invoke eye-rolling, from Bitcoin and even some Ethereum fans. Indeed, to many crypto purists “green NFTs” combine the sort of misplaced environmental whinging they would rather ignore.      The reality, like much else in the climate debate, is complex and nuanced.    Read more: The Frustrating, Maddening, All-Consuming Bitcoin Energy Debate    For Martin Wainstein, founder of the Open Earth Foundation, the fact that NFT artists have taken a firm and immediate stand provides a great way to raise awareness, and also to drive collaboration.      NFT art creation has highlighted the problem, but it’s not the problem per se, Wainstein points out. Rather, that’s the computational load of running smart contracts on Ethereum or the very large-scale proof-of-work mining that secures Bitcoin.      “I think it's fascinating that for the last four years, you haven't seen a single investor or innovator saying, ‘Oh, I love this, but I'm not going to touch Bitcoin because of the energy consumption,’” Wainstein said. “But as soon as it touches art, it kind of blows up.”      The relationship between NFTs and Ethereum with regards to energy consumption seems to be a source of confusion.      “The thing that’s not really being talked about is that the Ethereum blockchain is gonna move with or without you. Like blocks happen and they're full 100% of the time,” said RNDR Project Lead Joshua Bijak, whose background is in environmental electrical engineering. “It doesn't matter if those are NFT transactions, it can be ERC-20 tokens or whatever. So it's unfair to blame NFTs specifically for that.”    Open Earth's approach    The steps being taken by the collaborators behind Saturday’s carbon-neutral NFT sale include lessening the number of Ethereum blockchain events needed to individualize each digital artwork, meaning less computational workload in the NFT minting process.      ""For the purpose of this auction, we're trying to minimize how many deployments there will be,"" Bijak said, explaining that switching out from the “open editions” variety of NFT contracts removes the tendency to mint tokens ad nauseam.      Additionally, each NFT artwork (there are six digital artists featured in the show), will have another one-of-a-kind token pinned to it, and this second NFT represents carbon credits from a voluntary registry of a Peruvian deforestation project.      It’s worth noting that Nifty Gateway came under pressure to streamline its minting process, which is now being addressed.      Bijak points out this is now a highly sensitive area and even clear and reasonable attempts to minimize the relationship between NFTs and carbon emissions can cause consternation.      An example would be the tweeted medium post from NFT platform SuperRare, which was welcomed by many but also resulted in some backlash and artists saying they would be leaving the platform.    The artists    Nature-inspired artist and composer Sara Ludy, whose work forms part of CarbonDrop, said she has been conscious about the cost of rendering digital work before the recent NFT wave highlighted artists’ concerns.      “Ecological concerns have been a part of my work for quite a while,” Ludy said. “It’s an awareness that I try to implement in my own practice, and also when I was teaching experimental 3D virtual reality applications, to be ecologically aware of your computer usage.”      Award-winning multi-disciplinary artist Kyle Gordon, who is also part of the show, said he expects to see NFT platforms coming under pressure in the coming months to implement other systems that will help with energy use.      “At the end of the day, minting NFTs might not directly be the source of the energy usage, but by facilitating and encouraging the energy usage, it is part of the problem, part of a larger problem,” said Gordon. “While it’s really complicated, the key is collaboration.”",POSITIVE,RNDR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINING | RNDR,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/19/artists-back-green-nft-sale-citing-concerns-over-cryptos-environmental-impact,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7968f3d885f01177bd7349e3883ad562beb90082-2500x1250.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406125,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerzFh,1616177950,Money Reimagined: Bitcoin's Green Imperative,"Welcome to Money Reimagined.      It’s an all-bitcoin newsletter today, with a deep dive into the resurgent discussion around the leading cryptocurrency’s energy consumption (brought about by a rising price, ballooning hash power and interest from ESG-minded investors).      Because it’s such a rich, important topic, you get a twofer.      Our weekly “Money Reimagined” podcast is also about the energy debate. Sheila Warren and I talk to the always interesting Meltem Demirors, who made the case earlier this year that bitcoin can be thought of as a “money battery.” And we added in Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at GRIID, which is co-locating mining operations with renewable energy providers, increasing their revenue and helping develop their wider businesses.      Have a listen after reading the newsletter.    Bitcoin can go green and help fund clean energy    However much regulators and crypto advocates might wish the other didn’t exist, neither governments nor Bitcoin will disappear in our lifetime. It’s time they started working together on the planet’s most urgent issue: a sustainable global energy system.      Contrary to those who see it as “a giant smoldering Chernobyl,” there’s an alignment between Bitcoin’s underlying economics, which drives miners to low-cost energy sources, and the ongoing efficiency advances in renewable energy technologies.    You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    As we’ll see, market dynamics are already making that alignment happen. But to accelerate it to the pace needed to beat the climate crisis requires proactive measures at national, regional and city levels, as well as inside corporations. Society needs a deliberate strategy to incorporate bitcoin mining into a system-wide framework for renewable energy development.      The crypto industry’s free market purists might disagree but policy-based intervention is needed, precisely because energy markets are already plagued with distortions: misguided subsidies, illegal power access, inefficient electricity grids and geographic factors that hinder the integration of renewable sources.      Miners will go where they can make money. Without incentives that counter those market distortions, too many will continue contributing to a frightening acceleration in climate change.      Thankfully, lots of smart ideas are emerging to address this.    Carbon-heavy, but compared to what?    Although a 2019 CoinShares survey found an impressive 73% of all bitcoin mining powered by renewable energy, there’s no denying that Bitcoin, in its current state, contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions.      Cambridge University’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index’s midpoint estimate puts total energy consumption at 129 terawatt hours, accounting for 0.7% of total world consumption. Assuming the proportion from non-renewable sources remained at 27%, that means the network is still gobbling up 35 tw/h of carbon-intensive electricity, more than Denmark consumes from all sources. (See further discussion on these assumptions in the section below.)      On its own, the overall size of bitcoin’s consumption is meaningless. With the possible exception of geothermal-powered Icelanders, all communities using on-grid energy are by, default, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. The real question is: What value is derived from the activities for which that energy is used?      In the case of Bitcoin, the answer hinges on a subjective cost-benefit analysis of two alternative financial systems. We could phrase it as: How much value per kilowatt hour do you place on a decentralized, censorship-resistant system for exchanging provably scarce digital assets versus your per-kw/h value for the traditional, centralized financial system?      The global financial sector’s energy use is impossible to calculate. But we know it employs more than 20 million people, relies on sprawling, inefficient legacy computing systems and deploys extensive physical and cybersecurity measures. One can argue those measures include the U.S. military because its protection of global trade is fundamental to the dollar’s dominance.      How much energy does all that consume? And is it worth it?      Even without knowing the energy number, critics will argue, with sound logic, that the traditional system delivers much greater utility if you measure its value solely in dollar terms. The international payment system SWIFT, which forms just one part of that global financial system, averaged around $6 trillion a day worth of transactions in 2019, a thousand times the current average daily amount processed by the entire Bitcoin network.      But a future, massively scaled Bitcoin transaction network would not be nearly as energy-intensive, as it would incorporate more computationally efficient “layer 2” solutions such as Lightning.      More importantly, the dollar assessment doesn’t take into account the externalities of the traditional, gatekeeper-controlled system that Bitcoin’s open-access model seeks to overcome. These include barriers to innovation, financial exclusion and, arguably, the human cost of U.S. wars funded by it. Your view on relative energy value will vary depending on how you feel about these.    Proactive policy    Regardless of who’s right, mainstream concerns about Bitcoin’s massive energy “wastage” – a gross misnomer for an activity best described as the cost of securing the system – cannot be ignored.      As the price rises, along with hashrate and energy usage, Bitcoin’s ballooning carbon footprint is sowing nervousness among prospective investment institutions that are bound by ESG (environmental, social and governance) compliance. Pressure will grow for change or regulatory action.      To respond solely by highlighting the legacy system’s own energy intensity – as I did above – can look like “whataboutism.” Bitcoiners should instead engage with these concerned investors to promote Bitcoin-focused energy governance that serves everyone’s interest. They should enlist their help to persuade policy makers to take an outside-the-box, system-wide view of our energy challenges and of Bitcoin’s place in it.      The alliances already forming between the bitcoin mining industry and developers of green energy infrastructure pose a useful starting point for those discussions.      Speaking on the latest episode of our “Money Reimagined” podcast, Harry Sudock, vice president of strategy at mining infrastructure company GRIID, said his company is getting requests from developers of wind farms, large and small hydro dam generators, nuclear plants and other renewable providers to colocate bitcoin operations with their plants. “Everybody is looking for revenue-enhancement strategies that will support the growth and resilience of the energy they produce,” he said.      There are various ways in which governments, grid operators and municipal authorities could accelerate this trend, whether via subsidies or power purchase agreements.      Such policies would be doubly effective when contracts between cities and bitcoin miners are designed to help grid operators manage the peak-to-trough inefficiencies of base load energy production. Miners like Layer1 have struck deals where they’re paid to stop mining during demand peaks to free up electricity for consumers.      This model can be applied to solar energy’s “duck curve” problem, essentially a misalignment between power production and consumption. Miners act as natural buyers of the abundant power produced during daylight hours and sellers during high-demand early evenings. Indeed, miners that sold unused power back to the grid played a small but noteworthy role in helping Texas mitigate its recent storm-induced blackout.      Now, add to this a role for sustainability-conscious investors.      They can buy carbon credits to offset the impact of their bitcoin purchases, driving sustainable energy development in the process.      “Shark Tank” star Kevin O’Leary is being even more direct. He recently told CoinDesk TV he is choosing his bitcoin carefully by investing in the rewards earned by select bitcoin miners so “I can know that my coin is clean.” O’Leary suggested such strategies would help the growing ranks of ESG-driven investors assuage their concerns about Bitcoin’s carbon footprint.      Investors can go one step further by spending the purchasing power of their “clean bitcoin” on other renewable energy resources. This partly explains the decision of Aker SA, a Norwegian conglomerate, to go all-in on bitcoin.    Firing up the money battery    Meltem Demirors, the other guest on this week’s podcast episode, offers an outside-the-box analogy for how all this is coming together. She says Bitcoin is a “money battery.” It stores energy produced in remote places with abundant renewable energy, such as the windy regions of Morocco, in the form of digital money. The holders of that money can then seamlessly transport it to other locations, effectively making an energy transfer without the need for costly transmission lines.      That functionality is a result of bitcoin mining’s unique geographic-agnostic approach to energy usage, an idea whose sweeping potential Stone Ridge Asset Management founder Ross Stevens laid out in his widely cited 2020 shareholder letter.      “Imagine a future with Bitcoin mining firms, unsubsidized, in extraordinarily isolated locations – visualize a waterfall in a largely population-free part of an African country suffering from abject poverty – easily connected to the Bitcoin network, building serious energy infrastructure to monetize the local clean energy source for mining,” Stevens wrote.      Mining revenue could even help build roads, schools and housing, he argued.      It’s an appealing vision. But it won’t happen organically, at least not fast enough. To beat the climate time bomb, we need policy makers on board.    Rising price, rising energy bill    Here, courtesy of CoinDesk’s Shuai Hao, is our own chart of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance’s bitcoin consumption index. The Cambridge team first calculates upper and lower bound estimates by multiplying the Bitcoin network’s total hashrate by the per-hash electricity consumption of the most efficient machines available and by that of the least-efficient. Then it produces an estimate in the midpoint of the two extremes.      The Centre’s midpoint estimate of Bitcoin’s energy intake has increased, relatively steadily, over time. That tells us that, although mining rigs have become increasingly energy-efficient, with their core application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips able to calculate ever more hash functions at a faster pace, the overall growth of mining activity has outpaced that. That’s a direct result of the rising price, which draws waves of miners into the business.      However, the most striking element of the chart is the volatility of the upper bound estimate, a metric that assumes the network is using the most inefficient mining hardware available. (The lower bound assumes the network is running solely on the three most efficient machines.) Note that the spikes in the upper bound estimate coincide with periods of rising prices: in 2017, from mid-2019 through to March 2020, and, most notably, over the past four months to currently stand at 443 tw/h – six notches below France’s energy consumption in 2019.      This mostly just tells us that the hashrate is surging as miners fire up rigs to earn higher-priced bitcoin and that, if they were to meet that solely with work done by the oldest, least efficient mining rigs available, it would equate to a massive electricity drain. Clearly, that is not the case. Most are likely using more modern, efficient machines.      However, it’s worth speculating that, in this rising price environment, the network is more inefficient than normal and therefore that total energy consumption is higher than the midpoint estimate – maybe not at France’s 449 tw/h, but perhaps in line with Italy’s 242 tw/h.      Higher margins encourage miners to tap older, less-efficient ASIC machines, boosting their hashing power in search of bitcoin rewards. Supply delays from leading ASIC chip-makers such as Bitmain and Canaan, which struggle to meet surging demand for new machines, will further compel many to revive their older machines.      The bottom line: Bitcoin is an energy-gobbling colossus and rising prices will naturally increase that footprint. We must drive more of it to renewable sources.    The Conversation: Powell’s Soothing Message    In the most important economic event of the week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a post-rate decision press conference that took markets back from a knife edge and boosted a bunch of risk assets, including bitcoin.      It was a lesson in the nuances of the Fed’s expectation management strategy and it underscored how financial conditions have become especially sensitive to Powell’s utterances.      The discussion around bitcoin’s response also illustrated how the cryptocurrency has been mainstreamed this year. It is now an asset class worthy of consideration as part of a wider conversation about how Wall Street responds to macro policy matters.      The markets were relieved that Powell went out of his way to pre-emptively warn markets not to overreact to early signs of a post-pandemic bounce in economic growth and inflation.      For Craig Torres at Bloomberg, the clincher was not just what the Fed chief said. It was also that he made it abundantly clear that stronger economic data would notprompt the Fed to consider tightening rates. The Fed is working to a longer time frame so it can assess more “tangible” evidence of a post-COVID recovery before doing so.      The FOMC’s statement on keeping rates steady contained no surprises. If anything, the committee members’ forecasts of a future post-COVID rebound might have signaled a more hawkish stance toward tighter policy.      And yet, market expectations were leaning toward something more negative on the rate outlook. So as investment strategist Lyn Alden pointed out, the net effect was a “dovish tilt” that shifted all risk assets into the black while the dollar fell. And there it is: bitcoin in there with the big boys.      If Lyn Alden is a macro strategist who has discovered that bitcoin is relevant to macro analysis, Avi Felman of BlockTower is a crypto analyst who is finding his earlier thesis on bitcoin’s lack of correlation with other asset classes might need some tweaking. To him, bitcoin’s price behavior after the Fed news looked decidedly “macro” – a “pure rates play.”    Relevant reads (and listens): Bitcoin stimulus    The recent passage of the Biden Administration’s massive $1.9 trillion stimulus package was big news for everyone, including the Bitcoin community. It feeds into the crypto thesis that when the COVID-19 bill falls due for the U.S. government, and for others, policy makers will ultimately decide that the only way to cover the cost is through inflation – repaying debts denominated in today’s dollars with the lesser-valued dollars of the future. It also sparked a narrower but intriguing discussion in our coverage about whether people would literally invest their $1,400 stimulus checks into bitcoin.    The discussion first arose on the “Breakdown” podcast. In his show last weekend, NLW explored the package’s wider crypto implications – including the rather extreme thesis that it’s a precursor to full-blown modern monetary theory (MMT) – and flagged evidence from the last stimulus package.   On our “All About Bitcoin” TV show, CoinDesk’s director of data and indexes, Galen Moore, explored that evidence, which stems from data out of Coinbase, which saw an unusually large number of bitcoin purchases during the last stimulus distribution that exactly matched the size of the checks.   It turns out this is a serious enough possibility that Mizuho Securities conducted a survey on the matter, finding about $40 billion worth of stimulus checks would be spent on bitcoin and stocks, with about 60% going to the former. Jamie Crawley reports the investment bank estimates this would add about 3% to bitcoin’s value. (Don’t get too excited about that; we’re regularly seeing daily moves of that size.)",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Michael J.

42406118,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerz9n,1616177414,On Covering the NFT Hype,"The Lindsay Lohan NFT is the kind of story we at CoinDesk approach with a bit of trepidation.      On its face, it seemed tawdry and inconsequential: A tabloid celebrity cashing in on this bull market’s version of the 2017 initial coin offering bonanza, in partnership with a blockchain project known mainly for its marketing stunts. Plus, by simply writing about it, we risked abetting an endeavor that was, at best, silly. In a field where attention is almost as valuable as money, merely pointing out to our readers that something exists is often misperceived as “pumping” it.      But cover the story we did. Reporter Danny Nelson held his nose and did a yeoman’s job of spelling out how the auction of a non-fungible token by a former Disney moppet was a sign of the zeitgeist and market froth. He asked the right questions (was Tron paying Lohan? What exactly did the NFT entitle its holder to?) even if he couldn’t answer them with the limited information provided by Justin Sun’s PR team. When the pandemic is over, I will be buying Danny many drinks.      Why cover it at all, though? It’s a fair question. Not for clicks. Well, not just for clicks.    Marc Hochstein is CoinDesk's executive editor. This post originally appeared in The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal news stories on the future of money and Web 3.0. Subscribe to get the full email newsletter here.    In my book, Lohan’s NFT was far less important in the scheme of things than, say, the progress of Bitcoin’s Taproot upgrade or the return of BTC micropayments to Twitter (alas, poor ChangeTip!), both of which we covered the same day.      Still, a quick Lohan write-up was worth doing for the same reason other circuses sometimes merit a few paragraphs. As noted, it’s a bull market, and every day tens of thousands of new readers who normally don’t give a thought to cryptocurrency are coming to CoinDesk. When normies hear that Lindsay Lohan is hawking some weird investment, or that Elon Musk is tweeting about an electronic currency with a cute dog mascot, they are going to seek out information about these things whether we like it or not.      So the question is: What do you want them to find?      Hence, last month, when dogecoin was trending, tech reporter Colin Harper wrote a deep dive showing how the canine cryptocurrency’s codebase had until recently been neglected like a stray mutt. And last week, as numbers kept going up, CoinDesk Research analyst Christine Kim and Research Director Noelle Acheson penned a 41-page report (and a shorter article) detailing the risks of investing in two more-serious assets, bitcoin and ether. (They also co-hosted a webinar on the topic.)      To be clear: These pieces did not engage in fearmongering, as so much mainstream coverage of our industry does. They treated the audience as adults. Educated investors assess risks before making decisions, and we are trying to give readers some of the rudimentary tools to do their own research. I’m proud of those articles, and I’m proud of the way we handled the Lohan story – with context, skepticism and merciful brevity.      All the same, I’m glad we skipped the Charmin toilet paper NFT.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | TOKEN SALE,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/19/on-covering-the-nft-hype,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a5be347edfea2fd56c03d10e094342cc29632a24-1200x804.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerzBl,1616176588,Bitcoin Price Chart Shows Bull Fatigue as Analyst Sees 'Rising Wedge',"Bitcoin (BTC) appears set to challenge record highs in the wake of this week's dovish Federal Reserve meeting.      One expert, however, is calling caution, based on his observation of price charts as bitcoin rose from lows near $43,000 seen earlier this month. The chart pattern has taken the shape of what's known as a rising wedge, a sign of uptrend fatigue.      ""My concern is growing that we might run into a rising wedge scenario,"" Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. The wedge's support line is pretty strong, with more than four touchpoints, and that does give me some confidence, though, if we break lower through the trendline, which is when things could get ugly.""      The rising wedge comprises converging trendlines connecting higher lows and higher highs. The converging nature of the trendline indicates the waning of upside momentum. Hence, a breakdown – a move below the lower end of the rising wedge – is considered a sign of bullish-to-bearish trend change.      According to Heusser, a move below $54,000 would confirm the rising wedge breakdown and open the doors for a drop to $47,000. The immediate bias will remain bullish while the wedge support is held intact.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $58,900, having put in lows under $56,500 early Friday, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The cryptocurrency jumped from $55,000 to $60,000 earlier this week after the Fed signaled no interest rate hike until at least 2024, pushing back against growing fears of an early unwinding monetary stimulus.      Also read: Nexo: $100K BTC Is Inevitable but Won't Be a Smooth Ride      Some analysts say the Fed's dovish tone has put the cryptocurrency on the path to new record highs above $62,000. Patrick voiced similar opinion, while pointing to the rising wedge.      ""In terms of the bigger picture, I see no change. We are still in a bullish scenario, but the consolidation phase will take a little longer and that is not a bad thing,"" Heusser said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/19/bitcoin-price-chart-shows-bull-fatigue-as-analyst-sees-rising-wedge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/860cd18d2a4a6d3e8b8fa942878e6e6758a91797-1484x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the report, ByteTree Chief Investment Officer Charlie Morris wrote that 81% of institutional inflows to bitcoin have come via GBTC. (Grayscale is owned by CoinDesk parent company Digital Currency Group).      From alternatives like Osprey’s bitcoin fund to Bitwise’s cryptocurrency index to Canadian bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investors now have more choices for hassle-free bitcoin exposure. The once-sizable premium over the price of bitcoin for GBTC has flipped to a discount, reflecting a drop in demand for the vehicle.      With GBTC offering no premium, institutional inflows will likely slow further, which means GBTC won’t buy more BTC, which would remove a support for the market, ByteTree said.      “With luck, this is a GBTC problem and does not spread,"" Morris wrote. “Exchange-traded funds solve this problem. With many applications filed, I imagine they will come to market sooner or later. Like the European [exchange-traded products], they will trade at [net asset value], which is what investors want. Their fees will be lower, and all in all it will be a more attractive package. When they come, the only reason investors will stay in GBTC is capital gains tax.”      ByteTree says Digital Currency Group’s pledge to purchase up to $250 million in GBTC shares is not enough to keep the discount from falling further.      “To be taken seriously, they need to pledge to buy back that quantity each week,” Morris wrote.

The temporary measure was enacted last year when the coronavirus hit.      The Fed had been letting banks exclude cash and government bonds on their balance sheet when calculating their Supplementary Leverage Ratios (SLR), a gauge of capital adequacy. That rule will not be extended and will expire at the end of March, the Fed said in a statement.      The Fed added that it would “seek comment” on adjusting the SLR exemption and will take action to make sure that the changes “don’t erode the overall strength of bank capital requirements.” In April 2020, the exemption allowed banks to support the Treasury market, and expand the size of their balance sheets.      The Fed's announcement ""is causing a dollar pop and a bit of a dump in risk assets as it reduces bank liquidity,"" CrossTower Head of Trading Chad Steinglass said in an emailed statement.      Bitcoin, while often cast by cryptocurrency analysts as a potential hedge against inflation, is still considered by many Wall Street investors to be a risky asset, and it often ends up trading in sync with stocks rather than safer plays like bonds.

42406106,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerxEk,1616165501,This Ether Options Play by Institutions Has Lottery Ticket Potential,"Is it a lottery ticket on ether's (ETH) mooning? Or just a small part of a super-sophisticated trade?      A pair of wildly speculative options trades this week on the over-the-counter institutional cryptocurrency trading network Paradigm has analysts’ tongues wagging. If the option ""bet"" is correct, the profit can be huge if ether's price rises.      According to the tape, on March 14 two block trades crossed for a total of 1,644 call options contracts on ether, with a strike price of $25,000 and an expiration date of Dec. 31. In plain English, that means the buyer of the options stands to reap a massive profit if ether’s price jumps by a four-digit percentage by the end of this year. The Paradigm trades were booked on Deribit, the world’s biggest crypto-options exchange.      The trades, which came at a total estimated cost of about $82,200, have such farfetched odds that Skew, one of the top suppliers of data on the crypto options market, doesn’t even calculate them for a strike price that high. According to the firm’s charts, the odds of ending this year at a mere $2,500 are roughly one in five.      Read more: Trading Hall of Fame: The Bitcoin Options Bet That Made $58.2M Profit on Just $638K      However, if the position is held open till expiry and the cryptocurrency settles below $25,000 on Dec. 31, the buyer gets nothing, the premium for nought.      Buying these deeply out-of-the-money call options is akin to purchasing lottery tickets. The maximum loss is limited to the premium paid. But profits can be huge relative to the cost.      In December, CoinDesk reported on an options trader in the bitcoin market who made millions by buying several thousand contracts with a $36,000 strike price. At the time the trades were initially placed in October, the cryptocurrency was trading near $15,000.      Paradigm, an institutional-grade communications platform, automates price negotiation and settlement workflows for OTC digital asset traders.      ""Two counterparties, who have opposing interests can find each other and trade. All price agreement is via a bilateral request for quote process embedded within the Paradigm platform,"" Paradigm's co-founder, Anand Gomes, told CoinDesk.      Paradigm doesn’t comment on trade flows, so it’s not clear what was on the mind of the trader, or traders, who bought the deeply out-of-the-money options contract.      One possibility is the expectation the second-largest cryptocurrency will rise above $25,000 by the end of the year.      Another possibility is the investor is just betting ether’s price will push ever higher in the coming months, making that $25,000 strike price seem, well, not so farfetched. If that happened, the person could probably sell the options contract in the market, likely for a profit.      ""The buyer could be betting that the probability of ether rising above $25,000 by the end of December will go much higher than its current level, rather than betting on ETH actually crossing above that level,"" Samneet Chepal, quantitative analyst at the quantitative and systematic digital asset investment firm Ledger Prime, told CoinDesk.    Who sold the $25,000 call?    Then there’s the question of the options contract seller’s motive. The risk calculus is very different: While an options buyer gets massive potential upside with very small odds at the cost of the premium paid, the seller gets a guaranteed payout – that premium – but with a massive potential loss on the overall trade.      Also read: Ethereum Co-Founder: 'Right Now, I Don't Think There Is an Ethereum Killer Out There'      It's hard to imagine a sophisticated trader would sell a naked position in large quantities on these deep OTM calls,"" Chepal told CoinDesk. ""Although a trader would collect premium from selling the calls, these far-out-of-the-money options have the potential for significant mark-to-market losses, especially if there's a change in sentiment.”      The seller could be another institution selling the far-out-of-the-money call against a long position in the spot market or a market maker – an individual or a company ensuring that the market runs smoothly by enabling traders to buy and sell options even if there are no public orders to match the required trade.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/19/this-ether-options-play-by-institutions-has-lottery-ticket-potential,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71533dcfbe0a9a04710b2954b64bac32c47d9eed-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406084,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAerwy1,1616158800,Tau Protocol Debuts Hashrate Token Staking for Bitcoin Rewards,"Tau Protocol – a staking platform for Bitcoin hashrate tokens – is now live, offering an alternative way to invest in bitcoin mining.      Standard Hashrate Group’s newest project enables staking of the Bitcoin Standard Hashrate Token (BTCST) on the Tau Protocol for staking rewards in either bitcoin or the synthetic tBitcoin. The latter is equivalent in value to the top cryptocurrency by market value, according to the startup.      BTCST first launched in December and is backed by Genesis Mining, Binance Pool, Atlas Mining and others, comprising a claimed 12% of the global hash rate, the processing power on the Bitcoin network.      Similar to other hashrate tokens, BTCST is a synthetic asset which derives its value from a portion of Bitcoin's mining hash power. Each BTCST currently represents 0.1 TH/s of mining power and garners real cash flows from bitcoin mining. It enables hash power to be traded on BSC-based exchanges like 1Inch.      Now, those tokens can also be staked on Tau Protocol for further earnings in synthetic assets.      “We believe BTCST has connected bitcoin mining to the [decentralized finance] world,” Atlas Mining CEO Tony Ma said in a statement. “With BTCST, we can first earn real BTC via DeFi-native staking. Now, we can stake BTCST to earn synthetic proof-of-work assets. This is a logical step for BTCST as the bridge for Bitcoin to enter DeFi.”      See also: Valid Points: Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake May Happen Sooner Than You Think      The hashrate token market remains immature overall, according to a recent report from Galaxy Digital Mining. Only a few mining pools have hashrate tokens, such as Poolin and Binance Pool, and they remain only a drip in the crypto market bucket.      For example, the Poolin token, pBTC35a, has a market cap of only $23.4 million at press time, according to CoinGecko. Yet, a “clear trend” of crypt mining financialization is underway, the report adds, such as with the BTCSH token and hashrate token staking.      “BTCST expands the bitcoin ecosystem and ... has the potential to add a lot of value to the DeFi universe,” Genesis Mining COO Rene Hennen said in a statement.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | BNB,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/19/tau-protocol-debuts-hashrate-token-staking-for-bitcoin-rewards,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b329b717998af17f8ad2641769ea8290fd122901-1500x952.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The joint venture will be 50-50 with both firms splitting costs and revenue.  The new mining facility will be built in Alberta, where Link Global operates a majority of its bitcoin facilities. The 5-megawatt site will be solar-, wind- and natural gas-powered.  The agreement comes amid rising criticism for the energy used by the crypto mining industry and its impact on climate change.  ""We expect there to be substantial global pressure to develop sustainable bitcoin mining operations around the world, said Cale Moodie, Neptune CEO. ""We hope as a team to become a major powerhouse in low-cost, carbon-neutral mining and tapping available carbon credits for exchange in that burgeoning marketplace.”  On March, 4 the two firms partnered for Link to procure and operate 1,500 ASIC mining machines on behalf of Neptune.

Compared to prices a year ago, the crypto asset has increased more than tenfold and doubled since the beginning of the year.      While bitcoin owners are happy about these prices, financial analysts, econometrician, and value investors are still having a hard time valuing bitcoin as well as other cryptocurrencies. With bitcoin there is no interest or cash flow generated, making it difficult to apply quantitative valuation models.    Pascal Hügli is the chief research officer at Schlossberg & Co, in Switzerland, an accredited lecturer at HWZ and CCFE, and author of the book “Ignore at Your Own Risk: The New Decentralized World of Bitcoin and Blockchain.”  In search of a valuation model    By now there are numerous approaches. Probably the most controversial attempt was launched by a Twitter user going by the name of PlanB. His model is based on the so-called stock-to-flow ratio. This measures the relationship between the existing supply (stock) of any commodity – gold, silver, platinum, oil and bitcoin – and its annual production (flow).      As such, the stock-to-flow ratio is primarily an economic concept. It was used by PlanB to model bitcoin’s price trajectory to be able to make statements about future price developments. After criticism, the pseudonymous financial analyst doubled down and published an adapted version of his stock-to-flow model. With price predictions of up to $288,000 by the end of 2024, he told bitcoiners exactly what they wanted to hear.      See also: Pascal Hügli - Hyper-Stablecoinization: From Eurodollars to Crypto-Dollars      But even his adjustments failed to convince critics. They insisted his model was flawed and incoherent. Others believed they had made the model more coherent and thus more convincing by adding their own revisions. But the debate about whether there is any merit in applying the stock-to-flow model to bitcoin remains highly cloudy.    Tautology of money    One is tempted to ask: What predictive power does the stock-to-flow ratio have? Monetary theory at least, where the stock-to-flow concept originated, is clear on one thing: The ratio measures the ""hardness"" and thus suitability of a thing as (commodity) money. This is because (commodity) money is by definition the most marketable good and therefore has the highest exchangeability.      The term “commodity money” was originally introduced by the Austrian-American libertarian monetary economist Ludwig von Mises in his monumental work “The Theory of Money and Credit,” where he distinguishes it from two other forms of money: credit and token money.      Another monetary economist, a Hungarian-Canadian named Antal Fekete, expanded on von Mises’ ideas and described money as having the lowest marginal utility compared to any other good. Thus, one is happy about every additional unit of money, while one feels saturated with other goods at some point. As Fekete argued, the reason for this is the high marketability of money, which is universally exchangeable against all other goods.      So, the more marketable and thus exchangeable a thing is, the more worthwhile it is to hold on to it. But this has us run into the tautology of money: a good is hoarded because it is easily exchangeable and it is easily exchangeable because it has high hoardability.      In monetary theory, there are prominent attempts to resolve this circular argument, starting with von Mises himself. In practice, it is always paradoxical market processes that resolve such contradictions. In reflexive situations, where investors impact the assets they’re focused on, cause and effect fuel each other.    Scarcity is relative    The hoardability of money is thus expressed in a high stock-to-flow ratio, as large quantities of it are hoarded and relatively few new units enter circulation. The ""perfect"" commodity money also shows increasing marginal costs in production. This means the more of it one wants to produce, the more cost-intensive marginal production becomes. This circumstance is often described by the term “scarcity.”      A high stock-to-flow ratio can be translated into everyday language as follows: Due to a high stock, i.e., inventory, it can be assumed that all units of a good ever created are potentially still available somewhere. This is because the good is unlikely to be consumed or used up, but any stock is potential supply (see gold). At the same time, the flow can only be expanded with difficulty due to rising marginal costs in production.      Based on this, we can conclude goods with a high stock-to-flow ratio are only relatively scarce. Absolute scarcity does not actually exist. This is because scarcity is always determined by the relationship between supply and demand, i.e., stocks to flows.      See also: Nico Cordeiro - Why the Stock-to-Flow Bitcoin Valuation Model Is Wrong      Supply or selling volume, in turn, results from new production (flow) and existing stocks (stock). If scarcity prevails, supply and demand are not in ""equilibrium."" The stock of the commodity (money) in question is heavily hoarded and not brought onto markets for whatever reason. Because the flow component can hardly be influenced by trying to produce more, hardly any flow can be added to the market through new production, and so balance the ""scarcity."" This translates into hardness that is typical of any good with a high stock-to-flow ratio.      In that sense, a high stock-to-flow ratio is a necessary but not sufficient condition for (commodity) money. Also, a high stock-to-flow ratio is a necessary characteristic for a good to serve as hard money. At the same time, however, the ratio says nothing about how market participants value the good in question.    Inapplicable by definition    But what does the above have to do with bitcoin? Bitcoin's high stock-to-flow ratio is indicative of its hardness as money. Due to its high divisibility, uniformity, durability, transportability and ""scarcity,"" the crypto-asset also possesses characteristics that make it suitable as (commodity) money. It is these characteristic facts about the crypto asset that are currently making people discover bitcoin as money-like.      This discovery process may still be far from complete. The more people discover bitcoin as a monetary alternative, the higher the price is likely to rise. However, by definition, it’s impossible for the stock-to-flow model, in whatever version, to correctly predict future price developments based on past data points. Past results can never be translated into future returns with absolute certainty.      Ultimately, this is probably not the intention behind such models rightly understood. Rather, they serve to give investors (hopeful) indications. It can also be assumed the model will be confirmed here and there in the sense of a self-fulfilling prophecy, as the past correlation shows.    Stability comes after monetization    The following will be interesting to observe: In monetary theory, a high stock-to-flow ratio should gradually translate into low volatility. A convergence in hoarding means the market depth of bitcoin (stocks) will have grown to a considerable size compared to new (in-)flows.      Due to high stocks, the probability is higher, with other conditions remaining the same, that negative supply shocks or positive demand shocks can be offset in price. Potential supply in the form of stock can leave the hoards at any time and have a stabilizing effect on the price.      Oil and gold provide an example as well as a counterexample. The stock-to-flow ratio of crude oil is very low, hence the large price fluctuations when supply-side disruption occurs. For gold, on the other hand, the high stock-to-flow ratio has a price-damping effect.      For bitcoin, this could mean concretely. Once its monetization phase following an S-shaped adoption curve is ""completed,"" the bitcoin price should thus also become less volatile due to the steadily growing stock-to-flow ratio.      So does bitcoin's high stock-to-flow ratio prophecy price stability in the long run? A thorough understanding of monetary theory and its concepts would suggest that will happen.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Pascal Hügli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/19/if-stock-to-flow-is-right-bitcoin-volatility-should-wane,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67b9b403d417c8384b4f2a7867a1435a9d9df629-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In an announcement posted Thursday, Ripple said Entwistle has been appointed as the new managing director of its Southeast Asia business headquartered in Singapore.  Prior to joining Ripple, Entwistle worked for three decades in finance and technology firms, most recently at Uber, where he was chief business officer (international). Before that he spent more than 20 years at Goldman, including a stint as chairman of the bank's Southeast Asia business.  The appointment comes as Ripple is expanding its presence across Southeast Asia which includes 14 countries for its RippleNet and has seen transactions in the region grow 10 times in 2020.  Growth in Asia is particularly important to the company in light of its legal woes in the U.S. Ripple was sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in December 2020 which alleges the firm violated securities law, arguing the company failed to register its XRP token as a security or seek an exemption before the company began selling it seven years ago.  “The adoption of RippleNet among the region’s many fintechs, payments service providers and SMEs makes Southeast Asia our biggest market for both customer demand and transaction growth,"" said RippleNet general manager Asheesh Birla.
