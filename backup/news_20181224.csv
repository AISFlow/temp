42381438,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95liZ,1545661800,Nevermind the Bears: 2018 Was the Rude Awakening Crypto Needed,"Han Yoon is the CEO of Lunar Digital Assets, a project consulting and marketing firm focused on blockchain.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  The brutal bear market we faced this year was not only necessary, it's beneficial for the long-term outlook of this rapidly growing industry. Yes, I know – you've heard this a million times already. But honestly, this bear market was the best thing that happened for our company.  I say this with humbleness, because we had great leadership and advisors to guide us along the way – this market has made our company more resilient than ever, forced us to be more innovative, and will give a huge sense of pride and accomplishment when we come out of it alive and striving.  Not a lot of blockchain-related companies, whether it be projects, funds, agencies or even miners can say the same. This is Darwinism at work. Regularly, I hear about investment groups having no more money to invest, crypto funds being down more than 80 percent since the beginning of the year and ICOs that were swimming in cash that are now broke and bootstrapping to stay alive.  2019's theme, it seems, will be survival of the fittest.  Welcome Back to Reality  2018 was a wake-up call, a rude awakening from the dream-like bull run of 2017 where shady entities could raise $30 million with an idea, a white paper and a website.  Welcome to reality. Fiat still rules, investors want returns and the government can easily impose regulations to scare off investors. Unlike the financial world, however, there are no government bailouts. Ironically, also unlike the financial world, many people will go to prison -- for frauds, scams, and even ""crimes"" defined by archaic laws that should not apply to this new asset class.  Decentralization, a word that we throw around ever so often now, is a very powerful – and dangerous – ideology. We have become so desensitized to the word and its potential implications for the future of the world that most people forget how this entire blockchain industry was incepted. A single, powerful white paper gave birth to this movement.  No one thought that it was going to be easy or quickly met with mainstream adoption. Decentralization is in essence, a proxy war against the government, the oppressive financial systems and irresponsible or greedy corporations.  And Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin's creators, knew the dangers and risk that it could bestow upon his livelihood and family. Can you really blame him for remaining anonymous?  2017: More Harm than Good?  The truth is, 2017 was absolutely unwarranted. I'm not talking about Bitcoin, because if there is one thing that was warranted, its the Bitcoin bull run. It's simply how the market cycle works.  Those in cryptocurrencies long enough know this very well. So-called ""experts"" on mainstream media can say what they want, but Bitcoin is not going anywhere. It is the most thoroughly tested network for security and resiliency, and believe it or not, adoption is growing faster than ever.  What was not warranted, however, was the ICO craze that we allowed to happen.  It has irreparably harmed the connotation that comes with the three letters ""ICO."" People are getting creative now – PTOs, IEOs, MNOs and everything in between... just to distance themselves from the words ""initial coin offering."" And we sat there watching it happen, knowing well that 90 percent of projects would utterly fail. But how can we say anything when projects were doing 5x, 10x, 25x, 50x, 100x and people are happy?  I won't lie and say that I never had temptations to write a quick white paper and make a fancy website with trendy buzzwords to make a quick million. I also won't lie and say that I didn't lose a lot of money by holding. Everyone laughed and mocked litecoin creator Charlie Lee when he sold the top, but I wonder who's the one sitting comfortably now.  The ICO craze just happened so fast and intense that regulators were not given the opportunity to even consider creating a new asset class for the modern world. Hopefully some good news will come out of Congressman Davidson's plan to introduce legislation to re-classify digital assets.  Looking Forward into 2019  Price is almost irrelevant for altcoins right now. We can think of 2018 as the year those ""AOL CDs"" were ""airdropped"" into peoples mailboxes. Thousands of the world's smartest cryptographers, engineers and developers are building the infrastructure needed for the decentralized web, which many call ""web 3.0.""  If you're trying to build a business, there's a saying: ""follow the money."" If you're trying to be involved with the next world-transforming technology, I like to say ""follow the nerds"" (that's a compliment, not an insult).  2019 will definitely be an interesting year, with a lot at stake. Billions of dollars are still being poured into blockchain R&D and projects, it's not just about Bitcoin anymore. The race is on for mainstream adoption. Which protocol will be the next IPv4, HTTP, SMTP? Who will build the first MySpace? Which network will blow our minds with fiber optic-like transfer speeds? Who's novel idea will one day dethrone Reddit, as it did to Digg?  There doesn't have to be a single standard protocol or platform – that's not my point. My point is, the infrastructure is now barely being laid out and tested – some obviously outperforming others.  We are deviating from being a speculative market at such a fast rate that, quite honestly, caught me off-guard. Retail investors are actually performing due diligence before investing now! What a lovely sight to see.  For the past six months, we've received tens of hundreds, maybe thousands, of emails and requests from ""projects"" with no working product, no experience in the blockchain and had no reason to create a token for their idea. On average, we take on less than 20 percent of clients seeking help after performing due diligence, and invested in less than 1 percent of those seeking funding.  We were blessed enough to be able to almost 'choose' which projects we want to work with, thanks to all the word-of-mouth referrals from friends, partners, advisors and old-school networking. We welcomed the bear market with open arms because we were able to help projects achieve their goals. And through that process, we learned a lot.  Closing Thoughts  Blockchain projects, obviously, can not be evaluated in the same way as traditional companies.  Bitcoin started off as a grassroots movement, with a small group of cryptographers. This core principle has not changed, and we stress that to all our clients. The single most important factor for a project's survivability is its community. Without community, there is no network. Without a network, there is no value.  I will argue that 2018 was the most important year thus far in decentralization. Yes, many people lost a lot of money. Yes, there were scams and money-grabs. Yes, we could have done a better job at attempting to protect consumers and ultimately the industry. But the industry is stronger and growing faster than ever, despite what the prices say.  For those in it for the long run, and for those that want to build an empire, this year's bear market was just a prime opportunity to really focus on building. If you're thinking ""it's too late for me,"" you are completely wrong. You're not seeing the big picture. We're still on AOL dial-up internet. The canvas is 99.9 percent still untouched. Draw something with pencils until paintbrushes are available. You don't have to hold an ICO to draw – to add value and ideas to this toddler-stage industry.  2019 will be the year where we truly find out which teams are capable, which tech is scalable and flexible, and which 'novel' ideas that we see popping up every day are applicable.

Price action briefly halted along the primary Fibonacci extension point at around $4,159 before continuing a slow incline according to CoinBase data and has been presented with an opportunity to continue its momentum to $4,440, post-consolidation.  Volume for the period has also shot up substantially, with the move being backed by the largest injection since Dec. 20.  Weekly Chart  Evidence of the move can also be found on the weekly chart, where the price of bitcoin has risen above the Nov. 26 closing price at $4,103, emboldening the bulls to push higher on the week as the new session begins today.  The last crypto Christmas was marred by a continual sell-off, exemplified by bitcoin’s breakdown from $16,490 to $12,500 by Dec. 25 (after running up to an all-time high of $19,891 on Dec.17).  But the weekly has demonstrated a potential turnaround, with a large bullish candle accompanied by growing volume.  Here's what we see ahead:  Bitcoin has pushed above an ascending triangle breakout (continuation pattern) to the primary Fibonacci extension line, with accompanying volume.  The 4-hour chart has turned bullish on the CMF and OC and needs to clock higher highs in order to see a continuation in bullish price action.  Likely to consolidate before pushing to $4,440 as traders engage in a short-term sell-off.  The weekly chart shows a recovery bounce by the bulls has tipped the scales and we may be looking at a reversal of the primary bearish trend.  A break below $3,650 (Dec. 20 major swing low-swing high) would invalidate the bullish bias.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381432,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX95lb1,1545655220,Beyond CryptoKitties: 10 Trends That Defined the Year in Crypto Gaming,"Brian Flynn is a product designer and writer, who publishes NIFTY News, a newsletter on crypto collectables.  The following is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk’s 2018 Year in Review.  While the digital asset market has been volatile this year, a new set of digital assets emerged: non-fungible tokens.  Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are digital sound goods that are unique and openly programmable by nature. Here’s a list of the top headlines and stories affecting non-fungible tokens this year, followed by a list of predictions for 2019.  New standards — Non-fungible tokens came with a whole bundle of ways to construct game assets. Standards must be enforced and adopted to ensure tokens can talk to one another. Non-fungible tokens on Ethereum were birthed with the ERC-721 standard, but evolved quickly over the past year. Standards like Enjin’s ERC-1155 and ERC-998 allowed tokens to own other tokens and save on gas costs.  Non-Fungible Token Marketplaces — New non-fungible tokens started to appear after CryptoKitties launched. OpenSea and RareBits came onto the scene in the first quarter of the year allowing users to sell their game assets directly outside of the game’s environment. New tools started to arise like FanBits so users can make their own unique digital assets. These user-generated platforms have failed to attract buyers because of the value uncertainty, similar to many ICOs.  Digital Art Market — The user-generated market was most popular with artist platforms. New platforms such as Rare Art Labs, SuperRare and dada.NYC emerged that ascribed true digital scarcity and authenticity to the art market. With programmable contracts, artists can earn fees on secondary-market sales and even split it between multiple parties, unlike traditional physical art.  Record-setting sales — Despite the fluctuating market volatility, some NFTs sold for extraordinarily high prices. This includes the Gods Unchained card that sold for $60,000, the CryptoKitty that sold for $170,000 and virtual real estate in Decentraland selling up to $200,000.  Second-Layer Experiences — One of the biggest selling points of NFTs is the permissionless programmability component; being able to build on top of others’ platforms. CryptoKitties created and promoted the KittyVerse to promote third-party developers to create these experiences. This brought about KittyRace, KittyHats and more but they failed to gain any significant traction.  Intellectual Property – In March, CryptoKitties announced the launch of “celebrity kitties” with Curry Kitty (Steph Curry) as the first in the lineup. After some confusion and miscommunication, Axiom Zen, the creator of CryptoKitties, was threatened with a lawsuit over breach of NDA. Axiom Zen hoped to clear up the third-party open programmability component and preserve value capture of NFTs with the launch the NIFTY license. This caused some uproar in the community and eventually led the team to explore other methods of value capture.  What’s next for CryptoKitties? – Just recently the team behind CryptoKitties raised an additional $15 million. Dapper Labs (the new entity behind CryptoKitties) will now be building out new blockchain game experiences and tools with their new funding. Some of the investors on the list include Samsung Next, aXiomatic Gaming, and William Morris Endeavor, a talent agency.While the team hasn’t released exact details on their plan, given the list of investors we could expect partnerships with major brands. Niantic Labs, the studio behind Pokémon Go also announced a $200 million Series C, also had aXiomatic Gaming and Samsung as part of the raise, similar to Dapper Labs’ raise. This might be foreshadowing something much larger to come.  Better user experiences tools – The most pressing problem of dapps and non-fungible tokens was the need to use MetaMask and have ethereum on-hand to complete transactions. Others took notice, like Bitski, creating a lockbox for users’ digital goods without them needing to manage their private key. Coinbase Wallet, Vault, Opera and Trust Wallet (owned by Binance) also released dApp browsers to play blockchain games from a phone.  Developers flock to scalability – As users suffered from a lack of Ethereum scalability, EOS and WAX were able to take developer share. Mythical Games announced a $16 million raise to build blockchain games on EOS and their first title, Blankos. Meanwhile, some blockchain game studios are banking on Plasma like Loom Network and Blockade Games. Blockade Games announced $13 million in funding to build out their flagship title Neon District on top of Loom’s plasma implementation.  Title to watch: Gods Unchained – Coinbase-backed blockchain game Gods Unchained came out of the woodwork this year from game studio Fuel Games. The studio dipped its toes in the water with a game called EtherBots in the beginning of the year, but quickly realized the limitations of on-chain gameplay without scalability.Gods Unchained is a trading-card game utilizing NFTs but with off-chain gameplay. Users can still truly own their digital goods while not having to worry about “nerfing” or “buffing” cards in the game. Every time a player purchases a pack, some funds are sent to the tournament prize pool. The prize pool is already greater than $300,000 for the yet-to-be-release game.  2019 Predictions  Stablecoins will hide the blockchain – Next year is shaping up to be a battle between centralized and decentralized players. It’s going to be more than likely that stablecoins like the CENTRE Foundation's USD-C and MakerDAO’s Dai become fundamental to the Ethereum blockchain gaming ecosystem.As users start to earn in platforms, users will cash out in stablecoins. All digital goods will be priced in US dollars instead of ETH or other currencies for easier conversion.  Intersection of Play and Work – Consumer mining and staking services will blur the lines between play and labor. Users will know how much they can earn within a specific time frame. As liquidity starts to build in blockchain games, users will exactly know how much they can earn for playing a game for a specific amount of time.  Celebrities and digital merchandise – The consumer tech space has seen an influx of avatar apps this year. Snapchat doubled down on Bitmoji, Genies raises $10 million, and Zepeto reached the top of the app store. Celebrities and sports players will issue their own digital merchandise to fans which will grant VIP access and feature discounts.  It may be a while before digital merchandise lives on a blockchain — but it shouldn’t be long from now.  Have an opinionated take on 2018? CoinDesk is seeking submissions for our 2018 in Review.
