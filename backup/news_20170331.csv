42379363,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87bvD,1490992600,Bitcoin Mining Fraud Lawsuit Moves Forward in New Jersey,"A federal lawsuit filed by investors of a US-based bitcoin mining operation is moving ahead after months of little movement.  In mid-2014, investors in Lab Rat Data Processing alleged breach of contract, misrepresentation and fraud against the mining operation and its owner, Zachary Dailey. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, with miners racing for the chance to mint new bitcoins as a reward.  The ten plaintiffs alleged losses of over 2,000 bitcoins, an amount worth more than $2m at press time. Yet they hit a roadblock last year, after US District Judge Joseph Rodriguez questioned whether the New Jersey court actually had jurisdiction in the matter.  As reported at the time by the New Jersey Law Journal, the judge focused on the question of whether mining contracts sold by Lab Rat constituted ""bonds"" as argued by the plaintiffs. Rodriguez also moved to deflect a bid by the defendants to have the suit dismissed.  A new court order indicates that the years-long legal effort is now progressing.  On 30th March, Rodriguez sided with the plaintiffs, stating in an opinion that they had successfully argued that the court does, in fact, have jurisdiction over the case.  ""In light of the allegations set forth in the chart and the additional details provided in the proposed Second Amended Complaint, the Court is satisfied that it has diversity of citizenship subject matter jurisdiction and the amendment is not futile,"" Rodriguez wrote.

42379374,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87cAJ,1490983932,"Despite Reports, India's Bitcoin Policy Hasn’t Changed","Media sources in India reported this week that the government had deemed bitcoin illegal, causing a stir that appeared to be overblown.  Newspapers such as The Economic Times of India declared that, according to a statement from Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal, use of the digital currency was ""illegal"" and exposed users to potential violations of anti-money laundering rules.  Initially greeted as a shift in policy for India, which is home to a range of companies working on both bitcoin and blockchain-related projects, the statement has since come to be seen as merely a reiteration of an earlier position taken by officials in the country.  Indeed, the statement was nearly identical to one issued by the Reserve Bank of India in late 2013, which was largely a warning about price volatility and theft risks.  ""The absence of information of counterparties in such peer-to-peer anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws,"" the central bank said at the time.  A published copy of the question posed to the Indian government bears out these similarities:  ""The absence of counter parties in usage of [virtual currencies] including bitcoins, for illicit and illegal activities in anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws.""  Regardless of its interpretation, the controversy sparked by the misconstrued statement has led to calls for the Indian government to clearly outline its position on the legality of bitcoin.  A petition created on Change.org has attracted just over 7,600 signatures. A second one, similar in scope, has drawn more than 1,110 supporters.

42379380,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87cFL,1490976238,Ripple Prices Rise to Hit 2-Year High,"The price of XRP, the cryptocurrency underlying the Ripple network, hit a two-year high earlier today.  XRP rose to as much as $0.021 at 04:05 UTC, according to data from CoinMarketCap, representing a more than 100% gain over the last 24 hours and the highest level since January 2015. At press time, the average price of XRP is about $0.018.  Prices in that market advanced last week amidst broader speculation in the markets for alternative asset protocols. Miguel Vias, head of XRP markets for Ripple, commented on this development.  ""I think the rally last week was largely BTC inspired,"" he told CoinDesk.  Some of those markets (including, for example, litecoin) have risen in recent days, though observers are split as to what is driving trader interest beyond a chase for potential gains. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, echoed that sentiment when reached.  ""It's almost starting to look like a rotation from one altcoin to the next,"" he said.  It's not just XRP markets that are up today. Bitcoin prices have risen more than 4% at press time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), averaging $1,085.92 at press time after the day opened at $1,037.53.

42379373,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87c6X,1490972902,Arizona Governor Signs Blockchain Bill Into Law,"A bill in Arizona that recognizes blockchain signatures and smart contracts has officially become state law.  The measure was first introduced in early February, seeking to enshrine signatures recorded on a blockchain and smart contracts – self-executing pieces of code – under state law. Specifically, the bill aimed to make those types of records ""considered to be in an electronic format and to be an electronic record"".  That effort is complete, public records show. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey signed the bill on 29th March, just two days after it was sent by the state's Senate. Senators cleared the bill on the 23rd by a near-unanimous vote, after Arizona’s House of Representatives advanced the bill in late February.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the new law focuses on any ""record or contract"" tied to the tech.  The text states:  ""A signature that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in electronic form and to be an electronic signature ... A record or contract that is secured through blockchain technology is considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic record.""  The law mirrors, in some respects, a measure passed in Vermont last year that would make blockchain data admissible in court. Like the Arizona law, the Vermont bill focused specifically on data that would be a ""fact or record"" tied to a blockchain.

42379377,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87cBZ,1490968891,Japan's Bitcoin Law Goes Into Effect Tomorrow,"Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow.  The country's legislature passed a law, following months of debate, that brought bitcoin exchanges under anti-money laundering/know-your-customer rules, while also categorizing bitcoin as a kind of prepaid payment instrument.  It's a debate that began in the wake of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that shuttered after months of growing complications and, in the end, revelations of insolvency and alleged fraud.  According to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, that law goes into effect on 1st April, putting in place capital requirements for exchanges as well as cybersecurity and operational stipulations. In addition, those exchanges will also be required to conduct employee training programs and submit to annual audits.  Yet there may be more work to come in this area.  For example, Nomura Research Institute's Yasutake Okano indicated in a May 2016 report that other Japanese laws may need to change to account for the tech, including the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.  Reports indicate that other groups in Japan are moving to plug some of those gaps as well.  According to a report from Nikkei, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan decided earlier this week to begin developing standards for digital currencies like bitcoin. Its work mirrors other efforts being undertaken elsewhere, including Australia, which began pushing for such standards late last year.

42379364,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87bxj,1490965726,"MUFG, Standard Chartered Plan Blockchain Payments Launch for 2018","A group of international banks is reportedly planning the launch of cross-border payment services backed by blockchain.  According to Nikkei, the group – which includes Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Standard Chartered, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Banco Santander, the Royal Bank of Scotland and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce – is eyeing a 2018 launch, with a focus on both retail and commercial customers. Distributed ledger startup Ripple will provide the underlying technology, the paper said.  The past year has seen a number of banks worldwide test blockchain tech for cross-border payment purposes, including some who have trialed Ripple’s platform for this purpose. These include banks in India, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.  Bank-to-bank  payments have emerged as an appealing use case in the financial industry, even drawing the attention of some central banks.  Yet, the new service being envisioned by the group could see use beyond just cross-border payments, according to Nikkei.  The institutions are said to be weighing additional resources utilizing blockchain, including mechanisms that would enable the settlement of inter-bank agreements.  ""The seven banks are also mulling taking that innovation beyond wiring money. This could pave the way for integrating sales agreements with payment settlements at banking institutions,"" the paper said.

42379366,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87byz,1490961613,Second Life? Failed DAO Creators Are Making a Comeback Bid,"The last time the folks behind Slock.it needed to raise money they reimagined the way venture capital worked, and in the process raised the largest crowdfunding round in history.  Then everything came tumbling down in one of the most definitive moments of the early years of ethereum: The DAO, and its subsequent failure.  Instead of raising a round of traditional venture capital or going to centralized crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo that would have helped the Slock.it founders collect investments in exchange for a fee, the team wrote open-sourced code for decentralized funding platforms based on ethereum that could, in theory, never be shut down.  Things did not go as planned, however, and approximately $60m-worth of ether was drained from the The DAO by a hacker. Finally, the lost funds were returned via a controversial hard fork of the ethereum blockchain that resulted in what appears to be a permanent schism in the community.  Now, Slock.it has pivoted its business model. In some ways, the goal is even more lofty than before, but in others, namely the way it is raising capital, the polarizing startup has taken a much more conservative approach.  Mystery investor  Revealed yesterday, a single, unidentified entity is said to have invested a $2m seed round in Slock.it to hire at least five new people and build out a Universal Sharing Network (USN) that uses smart contracts to monetize the Internet of Things (IoT).  Slock.it chief operating officer Stephan Tual told CoinDesk:  ""The smart contracts that we’re going to write as part of the USN are going to be written keeping in mind all the lessons that we’ve learned from The DAO, both in terms of how to write smart contracts, how to keep them safe.""  CoinDesk was unable to independently confirm the investment as a result of the conditions of anonymity Tual said surround the investment.  But the COO also described a due-diligence process as part of the investment that included the verification of intellectual property ownership, and an ongoing financial auditing process related to how the company is spending funds and what the founders have accomplished.  With the new funding, the startup indicated it intends to hire at least one mobile app developer, a software engineer with IoT experience and a business manager to sell products and build relationships with manufacturers of locks, bikes, automobiles and more.  Discussions over the investment began in earnest about six months ago, according to Tual, who added that the unnamed investor also wished not to be identified as either a firm or an individual, but that details would likely be revealed as part of a larger unveiling in the future.  Tual said:  ""They wish to conduct their business in a way that will be part of a much greater strategy when it comes to blockchain and other fields.""  Life after The DAO  While it’s been a while since Slock.it was regularly in the headlines, the team has remained active behind the scenes.  According to Tual, the company has even been profitable since the collapse of The DAO, and has been charging consulting fees, including for projects such as a 'Democratic Mobility System' for German utility company Innogy SE.  The two firms have also partnered with the Oxygen Initiative, EBG Compleo, and Wallbe to build Share&Charge, a sharable charging station set to launch in April on both Apple and Android.  However, the revenue generated from the partnerships has not been sufficient to allow the company to build out its own flagship product, the USN –aimed to let users write elaborate leases for a wide range of internet-connected objects, in a similar way to how Airbnb lets users sublet their own property.  The startup isn't only concerned with raising funds, though, and Slock.it CTO Christoph Jentzsch last year revealed his plans for Charity DAO, designed to be a philanthropic implementation of The DAO concept.  According to Tual, the team learned lessons from the collapse of The DAO, and will build the resulting improvements into the USN. These include the implementation of what has been described as 'backdoors', but which Tual called ""escape mechanisms"", designed to cease the execution of a smart contract in certain extreme cases.  Panels of ""guardians"" will also be implemented to help oversee contract credentials and problems with the smart contract compiler or even with the programming language itself.  Tual took pains to provide assurance that security was at the top of the development check list, telling CoinDesk:  ""There’s going to be top-notch security around the stuff and who’s in a better place to do it than [us]?""  Philosophy shift  Prior to the rise of smart contracts, systems engineers tended to embrace the philosophy of 'fail-fast', meaning that products should be released early and frequently to test them 'in the wild'.  But, as The DAO perfectly illustrated, the intended immutability of the ethereum blockchain is not compatible with learning as you go.  The collapse of The DAO ultimately led to the creation of 'ethereum classic', a rival currency to ether, and built up some resentment of the team in the ethereum community.  Shortly after the collapse, some leading figures in the space even called for the Slock.it team to be ostracized. However, others did credithttps://blog.simpleblend.net/dao-attack-whos-blame/ the team for sticking around to help pick up the mess that ensued.  Tual is pragmatic about the criticisms, and again stressed the lessons the team has learned in areas ranging from building on blockchain more generally, to writing smart contracts and trusting (or not) the compilers that process them.  He concluded:  ""There will always be some people who make trollish comments about stuff online, and that’s the fun of the internet. The reality is there was a huge amount of work that we did to get this project.""

42379362,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX87btx,1490954454,Private Blockchains for Bitcoin Maximalists,"Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast, project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.  In this opinion piece, Hagelstrom takes on the private vs public blockchain debate, arguing that, while bitcoin may be a more interesting technology, private blockchains offer real business utility.  I'm sure reading the comments on this piece won't be pretty...  There are countless blog posts describing what a blockchain is, and particularly what private blockchains are, but you may notice the funny fact that none of them agree with each other.  I won't try to give another definition. Instead, I will try to add some more fuel to the fire. Private blockchains make sense, and yes, I intend to argue that point even though I consider myself a bitcoin maximalist.  Now, let me address some of what I expect will be your key arguments:  'Private blockchains are not as secure as the bitcoin blockchain'  Sure, so what?  Have you ever thought that the level of security needed for an open and anonymous network is not the same needed for one where all the participants are known and have some level of trust between each other?  'You need a token to incentivize miners to secure the network'  Of course, but only if you want to use proof of work. When transactions are not anonymous, you might want to use a simpler consensus mechanism.  After all, you only want to keep the data consistent between nodes and be able to detect if someone doesn't follow the rules.  In bitcoin, miners need an incentive to invest resources independent of the transactions they will be validating and securing. After all they don't even know who is transacting and what those transactions are for.  On the other hand, in a private blockchain, participants are incentivized by the goal established on that particular business network. If they think that by achieving multi-organization integration on a particular process will bring them cost reduction, that is incentive enough to play their role on the network.  'There isn’t real immutability without proof of work'  We agree again. But, we need to distinguish between tamper-proof and tamper-evident systems.  If grouping data in blocks and chaining them through hashes makes it possible to detect that someone changed history, it might be enough if I am able to identify the one who did.  Remember, we are not talking about anonymous members, so things might be easier when there are contracts in place that govern what happens when someone cheats.  'Those use cases can be solved by traditional databases'  Technologically speaking, probably.  But, governance is usually the hardest issue to tackle on intra-organizational integration projects. Implementing a traditional database, even a distributed one, means that the organizations need to agree on:  Who will own the data  Who will be the central authority to change or delete that data  Who will own the application layer that runs the business logic that validates the transactions when recorded.  Good luck with that.  But, if we can have a decentralized system where everybody can have a copy and only append new data validated by the rest of the members of the network, a very big obstacle is removed.  'That technology is not really interesting'  OK, but big companies don't implement new tech because it is 'cool' or 'interesting'. The whole point of investing in technology is to achieve some kind of efficiency in their business.  If running a multi-company business process can help them to reduce manual steps or validations, costs and risks, or even create new revenue streams, it might be enough to go for it.  In fact, their duty to their shareholders is to improve their bottom line, not having the coolest technology on the block.  'Do you think that private blockchains are as revolutionary and world-changing as bitcoin?'  Definitely no.  But, as I said before, as long as we can achieve efficiencies or an interesting return of investment, it is still a very attractive technology for enterprises.  In the meantime, we can all keep learning about the technology, test new functionalities and grow the ecosystem with human and monetary resources.  You never know, some of that, directly or indirectly, might even end up benefitting bitcoin.
