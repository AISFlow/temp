14063063,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539047,1687388434,"Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Files for Chapter 11, Seeks Restructuring Amid Crypto Winter","Core Scientific, a prominent Bitcoin mining company, has recently made headlines as it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The move comes as the crypto industry grapples with the enduring effects of the ongoing crypto winter, impacting various firms in the sector. Core Scientific’s decision to seek bankruptcy protection is part of its strategy to implement a comprehensive restructuring plan to navigate the challenging market conditions. Amid a comprehensive review of potential alternatives and extensive discussions with stakeholders, Core Scientific has taken the step of filing for bankruptcy protection to enable the execution of a restructuring support agreement (RSA). Related Reading: Bitcoin Cash Surges 20% In One Day As Market Rebounds, What’s Next? The company aims to swiftly address its financial challenges and emerge stronger from the restructuring process. As part of its commitment to transparently communicate its intentions, Core Scientific has filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. The Bitcoin miner has now joined a growing list of crypto firms seeking similar measures. However, the decision reflects the company’s dedication to implementing a comprehensive restructuring plan to address its financial situation amidst the crypto winter. Core Scientific Pursuing A Comprehensive Restructuring Plan To facilitate its restructuring efforts, Core Scientific has filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code. With an estimated range of $1 billion to $10 billion in assets and a considerable number of creditors, the company is committed to swiftly navigating the restructuring process. During the Chapter 11 process, Core Scientific remains steadfast in its commitment to operating its existing self-mining and hosting operations, which have demonstrated positive cash flow. The company aims to leverage its state-of-the-art data centers to provide uninterrupted hosting services and self-mining capabilities while undergoing the restructuring process. Core Scientific first filed for bankruptcy in 2022 following the widespread contagion triggered by the FTX exchange collapse. Bitcoin miners suffered severe losses leading to the bankruptcy of multiple mining firms including Celsius Mining and Compute North. However, as the market has begun to recover and BTC’s price has moved above $30,000 once more, the headwinds for miners are starting to look better. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On? Core Scientific has already reported an increase in its BTC mining activities as prices have recovered, which has further propelled its ability to move through its current debt issues. The company already produced 1,314 BTC in the last month, a 16% increase from the prior month. As for its stock prices, Core Scientific’s stocks have suffered massive losses in the last two years. The company was valued at around $4 billion when it went public back in 2021 with its stock price reaching as high as $15. However, it has since lost most of its value with the stock price now sitting at $0.4455 and the company value at around $70 million.

14061528,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539026,1687384836,"Bitcoin Faces Tough Resistance At $30,000 – Can It Overcome The Hurdle?","Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency in the market, has demonstrated a strong shift in investor sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, BTC has surged by an impressive 9%, currently trading at $29,300. However, Bitcoin still faces significant hurdles, with a resistance line placed at $29,500, as well as a key psychological level at $30,000 that has not been reached since April 19th. BTC’s Moment Of Truth Material Indicators, a cryptocurrency data analysis firm, has identified a substantial resistance level for BTC at $30,000. This resistance level has been building and may impede the cryptocurrency’s upward momentum, potentially causing it to become range-bound, as has occurred several times this year. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Investor Trading Volume Rises, Stage Set For Another Massive Rally? If BTC fails to break through this resistance level, it could become trapped in a narrow trading range, limiting its potential for further growth. However, if it manages to overcome this hurdle, it could provide a strong bullish signal for investors and potentially lead to further price increases. One key factor that Material Indicators is watching is bid liquidity in the active trading range. Bid liquidity refers to the amount of buying power in the market and is a crucial indicator of investor sentiment and confidence in a particular asset. The company is closely monitoring how much bid liquidity moves into the active trading range to serve as support for BTC. In addition, Material Indicators is anticipating the testimony of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which could impact the cryptocurrency markets. While the company does not expect any major surprises from Powell’s testimony, they recognize that these events can often lead to increased volatility and uncertainty in the markets. However, Bitcoin needs to maintain its bullish momentum and overcome the nearest resistance level of $29,500 to have a chance at breaching the crucial $30,000 line. On the other hand, if this attempt fails, it will be crucial for BTC to consolidate above $29,000 and prevent any further downside movements. Bitcoin Set For Major Rally? Ted Talks Macro, a well-known cryptocurrency trader and host of a popular podcast has recently updated his macro view for BTC, highlighting several bullish factors that could drive the cryptocurrency’s price higher in the coming months. According to Ted, the market has now accepted above February’s highs and is forming a higher low on the weekly timeframe. This is a bullish signal that suggests BTC is on track for further gains. In March, Ted noted that the high-timeframe bull idea would be invalidated if BTC dropped back into the range below $24,500. However, this did not happen, and the bulls showed up to support the price of BTC. In addition to these technical factors, Ted identified several narratives that could drive sentiment over the coming quarters. These include the upcoming BTC halving, the launch of the Blackrock spot ETF (and other similar products), the Federal Reserve’s pause on interest rate hikes, and the launch of crypto exchanges by traditional finance giants. Related Reading: MATIC Price Gains Momentum, But Bulls Face Uncertainty Without Breaking Vital Resistance Based on these factors, Ted Talks Macro has set a target of $35,000 for BTC, which is now in play. This target represents a significant increase from BTC’s current price and suggests that the cryptocurrency market could be poised for a major rally in the months ahead.

The “GutterMelo MB.03” digital sneaker collection will open its mint on NFT marketplace OpenSea on June 29.  According to its website, the sneaker collection welcomes a “new era for hoops apparel and fashion,” and was designed by Ball as a part of MB, his fashion collaboration with Puma. Each buyer that purchases the NFT sneakers will also receive a physical counterpart they can flex in real life.  “This collaboration pushes the boundaries of innovation by empowering hoopers to express their unique style both on the court and online, while bringing more mainstream awareness to web3 technology and digital collectibles,” reads the site.  Eager buyers can now register to purchase on allowlist platform Premint, though the site has already claimed it’s over-allocated and not all buyers will be able to mint into the collection. Collectors who get on the early access allowlist can purchase the GutterMelo MB.03 sneakers for $175, while those on the early access waitlist will pay $195.

Bitcoin has entered into overbought territory, which historically has been good for BTC prices  Bitcon is ringing several bullish technical indicators, as the “BlackRock Pivot” extends into day seven. The question facing investors is whether the improvement represents a long-term change, or a brief correction before turning down again.  Bitcoin recently rose more than 7% on Wednesday, breaching the psychologically important $30,000 price level, last reached in April. Bitcoin also breached the upper range of its Bollinger Bands, for the second consecutive day, a bullish signal.  Trading volume in BTC was above its 20-day moving average for the third consecutive day, while Bitcoin as a percentage of overall crypto market capitalization reached 51.6%.  The upswing follows what will likely rank as two of the most significant events in crypto this year – the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuits versus Binance and Coinbase on June 5 and 6, and financial services giant BlackRock’s filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF last week.  Event one led to a 5% decline in BTC’s price over two days, completing a 16% drop that began in April. Event 2 led to an about-face, with prices rising 1.3% on the announcement and an additional 17% since.  What happens next will be intriguing to watch. Blackrock’s ETF application may serve as a significant pivot event in 2023 crypto, and possibly beyond. Three areas stand out.  Reputational risk for bitcoin improves with BlackRock entering the fray. Writing off BTC’s merits when the world's largest asset manager is expanding its crypto presence becomes more challenging.  An approval of a BlackRock ETF adds a large buyer to the market, as the ETF will need to acquire BTC in order to provide investment exposure.  A successful approval outlines a framework for similar projects by large asset managers, creating the potential for repeated successful filings. While not ETF related, the announcement of Fidelity and Schwab’s crypto exchange intentions, and Deutsche Bank’s plan’s for crypto custodianship, over additional evidence of TradFi’s a creeping flow into crypto.  Bitcoin’s price spike has led to its Relative Strength Index (RSI) surpassing 70, traditionally s a signal that the asset is “overbought.” This has not been the case for bitcoin historically however.  Since 2015, bitcoin’s RSI has surpassed 70, 416 times. In the 30 days ensuing, BTC’s price has risen 13.5%. On the 65 occasions since 2015 when the RSI has ranged between 72-74, the price has climbed 12.9%.  By comparison, ETH's average 30-day gain following a 70+ RSI reading is just 3.3%. The data indicates that bitcoin has a tendency for prolonged moves higher, even when technically overbought.  Bearish investors who do not expect history to repeat itself may be eyeing $27,000 as a target price, as it coincides with BTC’s 20-day moving average.  The weight of BlackRock’s announcement, increased trading volumes’ and BTC’s penchant to trend when overbought may prove challenging for bearish investors however.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/blackrock-pivot-continues-as-bitcoin-rises-on-increased-volume,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0bedfa62fa5104ffe2b85562c4ba77e43bf38a4c-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap are experiencing profits, but BTC is outperforming other assets in the sector. Bitcoin Next Bull Run, Bad News For Tesla And Tech? The key to tracking Bitcoin’s next bull run could be its correlation with tech equities. The nascent crypto industry has been moving in tandem with this sector since 2021. At that time, the price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of around $69,000. The correlation with tech equities, as measured by the performance of the Nasdaq 100, has been decreasing over time and could continue this trajectory. According to the former hedge fund manager for Goldman Sachs, Raoul Pal, Bitcoin, and crypto are on track to outperform tech equities and “all other equities.” Despite the short-term turmoil in 2023, BTC’s price experienced a 75% increase year-to-date (YTD). In that sense, Ethereum (ETH), Tesla (TSLA), and other tech stocks have been rallying and will likely see further profits. As of this writing, ETH and TSLA experienced 50% and 160% profit, respectively. However, Pal believes BTC will take the crown in the short term as the cryptocurrency extend its “bull market.” According to Pal, the bear market for BTC ended in October 2022 as liquidity across the financial sector bottomed out. As seen in the chart below, liquidity and financial conditions have been improving, according to Pal. In the past, whenever liquidity increased, BTC and equities followed.

42420176,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa26X,1687380300,Reviewing the Tether Documents,"Last week, CoinDesk received documents in response to a New York state Freedom of Information Law request about the details of Tether’s reserves. These documents were released two years after our original filing in 2021 and only after a full-blown legal fight with Tether, which CoinDesk won in February.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Commercial paper trail  The narrative  Tether had billions of dollars’ worth of commercial paper issued by financial institutions worldwide. It tapped a number of banks to hold its funds, and it had to detail its procedures with the New York State Attorney General’s office (NYAG) even after settling the regulator’s inquiry into the company.  Why it matters  Whether the Tether stablecoin (USDT) has been fully backed with reserves has been a question for years. In 2019, skeptics were vindicated after the New York Attorney General’s office announced there was a roughly $850 million hole caused by Tether loaning funds from its reserve to Bitfinex, its sister company. Still, Tether claimed it had patched the hole and was fully backed again in the years following that announcement.  Breaking it down  On the morning of June 15, CoinDesk’s counsel with Klaris Law emailed a handful of editors (including yours truly) to let us know the New York State Attorney General’s FOIL officer had finally emailed us documents responsive to a request filed in June 2021.  Among these documents were details about the commercial paper and securities issued by an international suite of banks to Tether; portfolio reports from banks that held Tether’s funds and letters from Tether’s counsel to the NYAG detailing the company’s know-your-customer (KYC) and other protocols.  In the FOIL request, CoinDesk asked for “a copy of the asset reserve composition details backing the stablecoin Tether ($USDT) for Tether Operations Limited. These details should have been provided to the OAG as part of the investigation into iFinex which was settled earlier this year. I'm specifically only looking for information about what is backing Tether's reserves, including the document Tether claims to have sent OAG in May 2021.”  I don’t really have a lot more to add at this point than what we’ve already published so I’ll just send you to that article.  One interesting detail is Tether’s response. The company published a statement before any CoinDesk reporters even had a chance to dig into the documents we received, and published a second one on Friday after Bloomberg published a story on the documents (also prior to CoinDesk publishing anything).  As of press time for this newsletter, Tether has yet to respond to an initial list of detailed questions sent to the company on Friday through external spokespeople as of time of writing.

42420163,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa1wD,1687380253,A Straightforward Explanation for Why Financial Giants Want to Issue a Spot Bitcoin ETF,"The institutions are taking a fresh look at crypto and they’re flooding in.  Last week, BlackRock (BLK) applied for a spot bitcoin exchange-trade fund (ETF). This week, another comically large asset manager in Invesco (IVZ) reapplied for approval to offer a spot bitcoin ETF. The less-comically large ETF-sponsor WisdomTree also refiled for a spot bitcoin product yesterday (WisdomTree’s filing was initially rejected by the SEC in 2022).  Elsewhere in non-bitcoin crypto, a crypto exchange backed by Fidelity, Schwab and Citadel Securities launched in the United States and Deutsche Bank applied for a digital asset license in Germany.  Read more: George Kaloudis – BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Would Be a Big Deal | Opinion  So yes, the institutions are back. But why did $10 trillion asset manager BlackRock and $1.5 trillion asset manager Invesco decide it was time for the spot bitcoin ETF again? Many have offered convoluted and tinfoil-hat theories (some which I quite like).  Theories like BlackRock is scrambling to backstop Coinbase for some reason or the big firms are acting on behalf of three letter agencies to keep self-custodied bitcoin away from everyday people or that Wall Street can’t let the crypto crowd get too far ahead of them.  There are more theories out there, but here’s a much simpler one: Financial institutions like making money and offering a spot bitcoin ETF is a way to make money.  Let’s focus on BlackRock for a second. If you operate under the assumption that BlackRock has clients (it does) and those clients have money they want to give to BlackRock (they do) and those clients are willing to pay BlackRock to take care of that money (they are) and that BlackRock listens to clients (it mostly does), then it doesn’t take a massive leap of faith to believe that there is some amount of client demand for “crypto exposure” that would make offering customers exposure to crypto worth it. In exchange, of course, for a fee.  The fact that BlackRock sees a spot bitcoin ETF as the path of least resistance in offering that exposure to its clients is a different story. BlackRock will only make money on this ETF if approved. So far about a dozen spot bitcoin ETF applications have been rejected by the SEC (though there are reasons to believe BlackRock's latest application will satisfy the market surveillance and disclosure requirements demanded by the SEC).  Read more: George Kaloudis – 'Wall Street’ Doesn’t Need Bitcoin; Bitcoin Doesn’t Need ‘Wall Street’ | Opinion  To be sure, the path of least resistance for crypto exposure is that way since the SEC has committed to, as CoinDesk’s David Z. Morris puts it, “burning the earth and salting the fields of the cryptocurrency industry.” This makes it abundantly clear that the SEC doesn’t really have an issue with bitcoin and that its issue lies with other alleged securities masquerading as cryptocurrencies.  Also, it’s not that BlackRock specifically likes bitcoin or crypto overall. In fact, BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink once called the Bitcoin protocol an “index of money laundering.” So if the spot ETF is approved I’d expect other BlackRock-sponsored crypto products in the future.  I, for one, don’t think that BlackRock would apply for this spot bitcoin ETF if it didn’t think that it, arguably the most powerful company on Wall Street, could get the ETF approved. If I had my tinfoil hat on, then maybe there is a secret plot to make bitcoin look completely unappetizing to the world since even BlackRock couldn’t get a spot ETF through. I don’t think this is the case.  Perhaps that’s a bit naïve and there is an insidious reason behind the recent influx of spot bitcoin ETFs, but in the end you can point to one simple explanation for it all.  Financial institutions want to make money and this is a way to make money.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,George Kaloudis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/06/21/a-straightforward-explanation-for-why-financial-giants-want-to-issue-a-spot-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/42e9dd7f5ba5a9d2fa1240ee35dac638bf27f52d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Raft’s TVL has increased 4,595% since June 5, growing even as other protocols building stETH-backed stablecoins have stalled, such as Lybra, whose TVL around $180 million remains basically unchanged for the month, per blockchain statistics firm DefiLlama. Lybra’s eUSD stablecoin has a market cap of $84 million, while Raft’s R sits at $29 million.  The surge in Raft, an alternative stablecoin issuer, highlights the booming market for liquid staking tokens, which enable users to main liquidity, despite locking their ether to earn rewards for securing the Ethereum blockchain.

However, to sustain the momentum, it is crucial for SOL to surpass a significant resistance level. In the past 24 hours, SOL has experienced a 4% increase in value. Over the course of the past week, the altcoin has displayed notable upward movement, gaining over 9%. Despite the recent price rise, the technical outlook for SOL still leans towards a bearish influence. Both the demand and accumulation for SOL have remained low, indicating a bearish sentiment. The volatility of Bitcoin, with its price reaching $28,900, has affected the overall market, including altcoins. Although some major altcoins have seen price appreciation, they are still struggling to break through immediate resistance levels. Related Reading: US Bitcoin Investor Trading Volume Rises, Stage Set For Another Massive Rally? The stability of the broader market is crucial for the future performance of SOL. The market capitalization of SOL has declined, indicating a higher selling strength in the market Solana Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $16.74. The altcoin has rebounded from the price level of $14.40 and is currently showing a steady appreciation on its chart. However, in order for the bullish momentum to strengthen, SOL needs to surpass the immediate resistance level of $17.20. If buyers fail to step in and drive the price higher, there is a possibility of a retracement in the chart. The local support level for SOL is situated at $15.21. If the coin is unable to sustain its position above this support level, it may further decline below $14.40. Technical Analysis Although SOL has recovered from the oversold territory, the buying strength remains relatively weak despite a slight improvement. This is evident from the Relative Strength Index (RSI) being below the half-line, indicating that sellers maintain control over the price action. Additionally, SOL has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, suggesting that demand is still low and sellers are the driving force behind the market momentum. For a more positive outlook, it is essential for SOL to successfully surpass the $17 price level. This breakthrough would potentially attract renewed demand to the market. On the one-day chart, SOL has displayed mixed signals, including the emergence of buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), which indicates momentum and potential shifts, has started forming green histograms associated with buy signals. This suggests the possibility of a positive price change for SOL in the future.

Lawyers, advisers and other professionals attempting to transform a ""smoldering heap of wreckage"" have garnered almost 35K billable hours by January 31. “These proceedings appear on track to be very expensive by any measure,” said bankruptcy attorney Katherine Stadler, noting the billed total for the first seven months of the case represents over 2% of reported estate assets and 10% of reported cash. Recall that FTX ( FTT-USD ) filed for Chapter 11 on Nov. 11, 2022, roiling the crypto industry and prompting increased regulatory scrutiny of the space, especially trading platforms. Since then, the company's new management, led by John J. Ray III, has been trying to settle its affairs and refund customers. “What makes these cases extraordinary, however, is the largely unregulated financial system in which the debtors (and other similar financial technology companies) operate, combined with their global scope, the complete absence of corporate records, and the non-existence of even the most basic corporate governance,” Stadler said. The 47-page filing showed that law firm Sullivan & Cromwell charged about $42M in fees and expenses over the first interim fee period of the case. And restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal North America charged more than $28M. Firms that counsel other struggling crypto companies like Three Arrows Capital and BlockFi also stand to collect outsized legal fees.

Could this be the start of a rally to $45,000? Bitcoin defies the odds Bitcoin is unstoppable. It’s a rocket ship; a turbo-charged dynamo; an asset that can save anyone who has the nouse to climb onboard. The SEC and the US government can do what they may but bitcoin is sound money, something all fiat currencies completely lack. The king of the cryptocurrencies is saying no to censorship, no to being taken down, and no to the madness of central banks and their attempt to gain full control over the citizenry with the eventual imposition of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Over the last couple of days bitcoin has proved the doubters wrong, and not only that, it has given the powers that be plenty to think about. SEC chairman Gary Gensler must have thought that he had put the stopper back into the bottle when he unleashed his attacks on the top crypto exchanges, but bitcoin has other ideas. Blackrock, Fidelity, and others' entry into the crypto space might also have something to do with it. What next? Of course, this particular pump may now be rejected from the $30,000 resistance. It will need some power behind it indeed if it is to somehow blast its way through. However, bitcoin has a history of doing the unexpected, and now the calvary, in the form of the big institutions, looks as though it is arriving and who knows now what might happen. The next step for bitcoin, if it can maintain the momentum, is to make a new local high of around $31,000, which will surpass the one made in mid-April. From there it will be a case of also making a higher low than $24,800, although it might be hoped that $27,000 or even $30,000 can be the new support. So far infallible signal indicates upside One little known indicator in bitcoin’s favour is the NVT & HV Combo. This indicator flashed today as the signal line crossed the 40 level and maintained its green colour on the 5-day and the weekly time frames. Green means that price should continue to the upside, while red would signal the opposite. This particular indicator has flashed only 7 times previously since 2017 without any false signals. Today’s signal is the eighth time, and many will hope that this signal is a particularly fruitful one. $45,000 beckons. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42420169,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa22P,1687374126,Bankrupt Hedge Fund 3AC's Return as a VC Stirring Up Crypto Community,"Three Arrows Capital (3AC)is stirring up the crypto community again, this time with a surprise comeback using the same name, only in the guise of a venture capital (VC) firm.  On Wednesday OPNX, the bankruptcy claims exchange co-founded by CoinFLEX executives and two people behind the defunct hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC), announced that they have a new partner: 3AC Ventures. The partners will “invest in projects building in the OPNX ecosystem and working toward a decentralized future,” OPNX tweeted.  3AC Ventures even has a website that says the new firm ""is focused on superior risk-adjusted returns without leverage.” The hedge fund 3AC collapsed last year after suffering heavy losses during the implosion of Terra’s LUNA stablecoin.  OPNX, the new exchange where users can trade debt claims on bankrupt companies like FTX and Voyager, went live in April and counts 3AC veterans Kyle Davies and Su Zhu among its founders. Even during the fundraising round, the exchange – then named GTX – faced scrutiny by the crypto community. Large players like Wintermute distanced itself from GTX immediately.  The exchange also stumbled during its rollout that initially saw low volume. Volume on the exchange has since risen, although a large portion of the crypto community has remained skeptical of the exchange and its backers.  So when it announced the partnership with freshly minted 3AC Ventures, the crypto community weighed in again doubtfully. Twitter influencer LilMoonLambo summed up the vibe, tweeting, “holy shit this is a real tweet.”  Even Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, got involved in the Twitter discourse. He retweeted Davies’ 3AC Ventures announcement, asking, “Why did 3AC die, please enlighten us?”  Su Zhu previously obtained a restraining order against Hayes from a Singapore court.  However, the skeptics haven’t deterred Davies from promoting the new VC firm’s goal.  ""3AC Ventures aims to provide support for projects that are building for a decentralized future. We are keen to collaborate with those brave enough to tackle the most significant challenges and create cutting-edge products,” Davies told CoinDesk.  The token for the OPNX exchange, OX, rose over 12% in the last 24 hours, while the overall crypto market also rallied as bitcoin traded above $30,000 on Wednesday.

14057168,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538985,1687374028,"Bitcoin Rally Appears To Be Fueled By Derivatives, Will It Last?","On-chain data shows that derivative exchanges have observed elevated activity as Bitcoin has rallied towards the $29,000 level. Bitcoin Spot Vs Derivative Trading Volume Ratio Has Been Quite Low Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the latest price increase is mainly driven by the derivatives. The indicator of interest here is the “trading volume ratio,” which measures the ratio between the Bitcoin trading volume on the spot exchanges and that on the derivative exchanges. The “trading volume” here naturally refers to the total amount of the cryptocurrency that investors are transacting/moving around on a platform or a group of platforms. When the value of the trading volume ratio is high, it means that the spot exchanges are observing a high amount of activity when compared to the derivative platforms. On the other hand, low values of the indicator imply the derivative exchanges are the ones seeing a relatively high volume at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin trading volume ratio over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have been quite low in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin trading volume ratio had taken a plunge back in March and has since moved mostly sideways around pretty low levels. This would suggest that there has been little spot activity in the market during this time, at least when compared to the volumes that the derivative exchanges have been observing. Interestingly, despite the price of the asset registering a sharp jump towards the $29,000 level during the past day, the ratio has failed to show any uptick, implying that the spot volumes continue to remain low relative to the derivatives activity. This fact would suggest that the latest rally may have in fact received its fuel from the derivatives, rather then the spot market. Historically, rallies that have started along with rising spot trading volumes have been the ones more likely to sustain for longer durations. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Deposit To Exchanges, What Does This Mean? From the chart, it’s visible that the Bitcoin price surge back in January of this year had kicked off when the trading volume ratio had been at relatively high levels. Similarly, the recovery rally back in March had also started when the indicator had seen an uplift (although a much smaller one). As mentioned earlier, the metric had plummeted shortly after this rally had occurred and has been at low levels since then. In this time, BTC has been unable to record any sustainable move. In the past day, however, things have obviously looked different, as the rapid price surge has been unlike anything the asset has displayed recently. Still, the fact that the spot volumes are still low means that the rally “appears weaker when compared to the solid rallies led by spot market at $16,000 and $19,000,” according to the quant. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue To Accumulate As BTC Makes Recovery Push It now remains to be seen if the ratio will continue to be low in the coming days, or if an uptick in spot activity would appear after all.

42410343,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJiKE,1687371125,Circle Restarts U.S. Treasury Purchases in BlackRock-Managed USDC Reserve Fund,"Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Financial has started buying U.S. Treasury bills as a reserve asset for its $28 billion USD Coin (USDC) after ditching all holdings amid the U.S. debt ceiling standoff last month.  The Circle Reserve Fund (USDXX), which is managed by asset management giant BlackRock (BLK), has started “building up our direct holdings of Treasuries,” chief financial officer Jeremy Fox-Geen said Wednesday during a company call that CoinDesk attended.  The fund will also keep repurchase agreements (repos) as part of the reserves, Fox-Geen added.  The development came after Circle reshuffled the backing of its stablecoin last month to protect USDC from a potential fallout if the U.S. government failed to increase its ability to borrow and default on its debt.  CEO Jeremy Allaire said in early May that the firm would not hold bonds maturing beyond the end of the month. By June, CoinDesk reported that the reserve fund rotated all holdings into tri-party repos involving systemically important banks such as Goldman Sachs, BNP Paribas, Bank of America and Royal Bank of Canada.  Eventually, U.S. lawmakers struck a deal to increase the nation’s debt limit and President Joe Biden signed the legislation on June 3, averting calamity on financial markets.  As of June 20, Circle added $2.2 billion of T-bills to the fund, while repos constituted some 90% of the fund’s $24.7 billion in assets, according to BlackRock’s website.

42410344,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJiNX,1687370978,"Bitcoin, Ether Fall Outside Howey Test Criteria","Will the application of the “Howey Test” spark the next bullish move in cryptocurrencies?  There’s always something worth examining within the digital asset landscape. One day the topic du jour may be market structure, while the next day, it may be the underpinning technology and on other days…like Wednesday, securities law may engage you.  During my past life as an equity research analyst, 99.9% of what I considered daily, was “security.” With crypto assets, it hasn’t been that straightforward. And with the growing regulatory scrutiny targeting the sector, the definition of what is and is not a security has taken center stage.  In my opinion, a public, transparent definition and application of what constitutes a security is a net positive for crypto markets.  Clarity is paramount, and more of it will benefit all involved, most notably holders and potential holders of crypto assets.  What is the Howey Test? While straightforward on the surface, it can also present as a Rorschach test, its interpretation being left to the individual making the evaluation. Ultimately the Howey test determines what is and is not a security, using four prongs.  An investment of capital  In a common enterprise  With the expectation of profit  Driven by the efforts of others  If an asset meets all four prongs of the Howey Test, then it’s a security, and is thus required to register with the SEC, under requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. If an asset does not meet those prongs, then it’s not. And from those four prongs, millions of dollars in legal fees will accrue.  The test has grown increasingly important lately, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has placed the securities label on a number of cryptocurrencies.  Doing so puts those assets and any group facilitating their transfer under the SEC’s jurisdiction..  The SEC’s “Framework of Investment Contract Analysis of Digital Assets” whitepaper implies that digital assets satisfy the first two prongs. First, investors can purchase and/or acquire digital assets in exchange for something of value. Second, the SEC argues that in evaluating digital assets, a “common enterprise typically exists.”  Because cryptos meet these criteria, the SEC can now target them, particularly those connected to a central entity, and/or issued for the purpose of raising capital.  For example, the SEC likely considers Solana’s SOL a security partly because of the existence of the Solana Foundation, and its board of directors. The Solana Foundation has rejected the SEC’s characterization.  The third and fourth prongs are where things get interesting, particularly for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). In many ways, these criteria appear to differentiate bitcoin from ether and other tokens.  The SEC’s white paper on digital assets carves out “responsibilities performed and expected to be performed by an associated person (AP), rather than an unaffiliated, dispersed community of network users”.  The SEC also stated that AP’s of securities create or support a market for or the price of the digital asset, including its creation or issuance, or control of supply.  Bitcoin and ether maxis should find comfort within these areas.  While some market observers believe that the SEC’s latest regulatory push is targeting crypto as a whole, bitcoin and ether – the two largest cryptos in market value appear to fall outside this growing scrutiny, if applying the Howey test. And the SEC conspicuously omitted both assets from any lists potentially catergorizing them as securities. Indeed, the decentralized nature of governance and issuance makes them more akin to commodities than securities.  Bitcoin and ether currently account for close to 70% of all of the cryptocurrency market’s capitalization. Since the SEC’s announced suit against Binance, BTC’s market cap dominance has increased 3%.  ETH’s market share has fallen from 20.52% to 20.1% with bitcoin fueling the decline. In the aggregate their combined market cap dominance increased by approximately 2%, while their correlations between each other rose 6%.  While bitcoin has been labeled digital gold and ether digital oil, a better term for both may be digital water. The immutable nature of their code would represent its solid state, and its ability to adapt and adjust to multiple regulatory scenarios represents its liquid state.  In an odd way, the Howey Test seeming inapplicability is what may ultimately provide confidence for newer investors and leave the SEC focusing on a shrinking piece of the pie.  -Glenn Williams Jr.  Time to Monitor Crypto Liquidity  In crypto markets, a lot of the attention is focused on scrutinizing price gyrations, sometimes overshadowing the significance of underlying liquidity trends. Adding such lenses can allow market participants to navigate the market better and understand where we stand in the cycle.  Price movements on thin volumes generally indicate a lower-quality signal than those accompanied by higher trading volumes. Thin volume signifies limited market participation at a specific price level, potentially leading to increased price volatility and reduced market depth. Conversely, higher trading volumes reflect broader market participation that indicates a more robust consensus and provides a more reliable foundation for price movements, thus enhancing the credibility of the signal.  As shown below, crypto trading volumes have generally been trending south for spot (left) and futures (right).  Some cases are related to changes in market structure and not investor preferences, including the significant decrease in BTC volumes in March 2023 after Binance ended its zero-fee trading policy for some key market pairs.  Other cases reflect a shift in market preferences. With few exceptions, trading volumes of assets aside from BTC and ETH have dropped most sharply, as investors rotate to the more battle-tested investment cases. Among the more prominent names, the shrinking liquidity trend has been especially evident for DOGE, Litecoin (LTC) and SOL.  Interestingly, however, these liquidity trends are showing early signs of stabilization or even reversal in some cases.  Spot trading volumes, the segment hardest hit in 2023, have been practicing a slight recovery and now stand a tad above 2022 volume lows. Still, that’s an improvement from the recent volume prints that marked the lowest levels since late 2020.  This slight recovery in spot volumes has been accompanied by market depth. Orderbook depth, another critical liquidity metric, has improved since the beginning of May for BTC and ETH (more so for the latter than the former). This recovery is noteworthy because it follows extensive reports of two top crypto liquidity providers curtailing their U.S. trading activity, which would, all else equal, imply a deterioration of order book depth instead of the improvement we have seen.Among non-BTC and non-ETH assets, the market's focus on liquidity is related to the impact on some of the assets mentioned in the SEC charges against Coinbase and Binance. Two weeks since the news broke, trading volumes in the five most prominent assets by market capitalization (SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, and ATOM) have not changed significantly. The most notable shift in these assets has been how trading activity seems to have moved from the U.S. to international markets since the beginning of the year, as the chart below shows.  Bear markets tend to end not with a bang but with a whimper. Indifference and apathy are the typical defining signatures of the last stage of the bear market psychology framework –denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance –that we borrowed from psychologists.  Judging from the state of crypto market liquidity, we’re deep in the fifth stage of grief territory. But some of the early signals of potential stabilization, or even a timid reversal, are interesting. Sustained recoveries in crypto market liquidity have been early confirmation signals of bull markets in the past two cycles. We are not seeing such signals just yet, but the time to start keeping monitoring them could be now.  -David Lawant, FalconX  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Managing Editor Markets The Americas James Rubin, here’s some news worth reading:  THE SURGE: Bitcoin broke $30,000 for the second time this year amid bullish sentiment in the market following a number of traditional finance (TradFi) players pushing further into crypto.

Conflux (CFX), one of the trendiest assets of 2023, has gained by 20.17% in the last 24 hours, emerging as the second biggest daily gainer, according to CoinMarketCap data. Prior to its price boost yesterday, Conflux had been on a bearish trend for most of the month, from $0.280 on June 1 to trade as low as $0.170 on June 16. Since the start of the month, the “Chinese MATIC” has lost about 33.33% of its market value.

Thereafter, the token witnessed a slight re-correction falling to a price of $0.213, and has remained around that price region since then. As of this writing, CFX changes hands at $0.217, with a 24-hour trading volume of $203 million – a result of a 387.97% trading volume surge in the past day. The cryptocurrency boasts a total market cap of $646 million, making it the 60th biggest token by market capitalization. CFX Trading At $0.217 | Source: CFXUSD Chart On Tradingview.com Conflux In 2023 So Far Conflux began the year slowly, showing little to no significant price movement in January before commencing an impressive bullish run in mid-February, gaining over 500% in value to trade at $0.32 on February 22. Thereafter, the Chinese no. 1 cryptocurrency experienced a significant price dip, sliding to a market price of $0.160 on March 12. This was followed by another upswing, which saw CFX hit its 2023 peak – so far – at $0.457 on March 20. Subsequent to these price movements, CFX recorded additional weighty gains and losses. However, since mid-April, the CFX market has been rather bearish, losing over 95% of its value between April 12 and till date. The Conflux Network aims to leverage blockchain technology, becoming a catalyst for the borderless economy. Founded in 2018, Conflux’s popularity mainly revolves around its prominent status as China’s only public blockchain. Asides from its interesting price history, Conflux has also captured news headlines in 2023 due to its strategic partnerships, most notably its collaboration with China’s second-largest telecommunications company – China Telecom – to produce Blockchain-enabled SIM cards. Could A Market Recovery Be On For Conflux? Following CFX’s current surge, it appears the token could be attempting a market resurgence and perhaps attain the high price levels seen at the beginning of the year. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breaks Through Crucial Resistance Point With 10% Climb According to the prediction site Coincodex, the current sentiment surrounding the CFX token is neutral, while its Fear & Greed Index is set to 59.

42410338,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJi0O,1687367677,Why Short Sellers May Have a Hard Time Betting Against Tether,"With the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seemingly committed to burning the earth and salting the fields of the cryptocurrency industry, the stablecoin tether (USDT) could face serious pressure. Whether out of worry of a direct regulatory attack by U.S. authorities, or of stress on related entities, the market is showing signs of concern about tether’s health.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.     Those concerns manifested in a minor depegging last week, with the asset-backed token dropping from its U.S. dollar face value to $0.0996.  Tether is crucially distinct from the so-called stablecoin TerraUSD, which imploded spectacularly a little over a year ago along with the underlying Terra blockchain. TerraUSD was proudly unbacked, relying instead on what turned out to be a fatally flawed “algorithmic” system.  Tether, by contrast, purports that its dollar-denominated tokens are fully backed by assets, including U.S. Treasury bonds, held by tether’s parent company. But a pattern of questionable attestations and activity over the years has built up a well of skepticism towards Tether, too. Most recently, a CoinDesk investigation showed seemingly misleading claims about the token’s backing assets circa 2021.  The worst-case scenario would be that Tether’s assets on hand don’t match the face value of outstanding tether tokens, currently just over $83 billion. That would mean some tether holders couldn’t redeem their tokens for real dollars in the event of a surge of redemptions.  As crypto winter grinds on, large tether holders may want to insulate themselves from that risk by taking a “short” position in the token that would pay out if tether lost its one-dollar peg. Some traders might also simply hope to profit from a short position in tether. It wouldn’t be the first time - last March, the hedge fund Fir Tree publicly shorted tether at significant scale, betting that its issuer Tether’s commercial paper holdings were fragile.  Some metrics could indicate increasing interest in shorting tether in recent days. For instance, the tether borrowing interest rate on the Compound decentralized lending platform spiked as high as 7.7% on June 20, after ranging between 4% and 4.4% over preceding weeks, reflecting higher borrowing demand. Curve’s 3Pool last week saw a huge spike in borrow interest in tether, largely from a single address that reportedly swapped the borrowed tether to USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. That transaction helped nudge tether slightly off its peg in the Curve market, and more broadly. Borrow and lending activity on the Aave V2 platform has also spiked in recent weeks to levels not seen since April, according to data from Parsec (account logins required).  But it turns out tether is a funny beast. While it’s not exactly difficult to short, the process is both technically complex and financially risky. The overall level of short interest is also hard to gauge considering how widely integrated USDT is in the crypto economy and in crypto trading pairs. A rising annual percentage yield (APY) cost for tether borrowers, for instance, could reflect several contributing factors including rising open interest in short positions or greater demand to take leveraged long positions in other assets, such as bitcoin.  That challenge and opacity may make the stablecoin more robust against even big-money skeptics.  There are also conflicting indicators. While Tether the company may be at regulatory risk, it seems to be thriving operationally. The firm reported $1.48 billion in profits in the first quarter of 2023, and has said it is investing some of those profits in assets including bitcoin. That might form an additional layer of stability, and defense against shorts.  See also: DeFi Needs More Than 'Synthetic High-Yield Products' | Opinion  You wouldn’t short a tether, would you?  In principle, shorting tether is straightforward.  “The easiest way to short tether is to do it on-chain – borrow tether, then sell it,” says Austin Campbell, a stablecoin veteran and founder of Zero Knowledge Consulting. “[Borrow it on decentralized lending protocols] Compound, Aave, whatever, then buy another stablecoin if you don’t want price pressure.”  This kind of short would pay off if tether crashed, making it cheaper to repay the initial loan. But there are a variety of obstacles to the trade, some unique to tether.  For one thing, there are relatively few trading venues outside of decentralized finance (DeFi) that make shorting tether straightforward, particularly for U.S. firms.  “A lot of the firms that want to short tether are not [crypto] natives, they’re traditional finance,” says Campbell. “They wind up going through broker-dealers, and it’s more expensive.”  That is, many of the firms who are skeptical of tether’s value, and with enough capital on hand to make the trade at scale, may not have the technical expertise to do so profitably via direct on-chain methods.  Going through a broker-dealer, though, increases the cost of the underlying trade, normally made up largely of the borrowing interest rate. As with all shorts, this carrying cost must be borne until the short pays off, nibbling away at potential profits with each passing day tether doesn’t depeg.  And the profits themselves might not be that great, since even a tether depeg would likely be confined to a tight band. Even tether skeptics would accept that the token is substantially backed by real assets.  See also: Tether Reports $1.48B Profit in Q1, Reveals Bitcoin, Gold Holdings  “Even if you short tether, it’s not going to zero, so what’s your risk reward?” asks Campbell. “If you want to make eight cents [on the dollar], is that worth it?”  Known unknowns  This limited upside only accentuates the significant risks in a tether short position. In particular, it’s uncertain when or if an SEC action against the Tether corporation, which would likely catalyze a significant depegging, might happen – if at all.  Jurisdiction is one factor. While the SEC was able to go after Binance because of the exchange’s U.S. subsidiary (among other factors), Tether has a less obvious operational footprint in the U.S. That’s not airtight protection from regulatory action, but it is an additional source of uncertainty for anyone considering a big short.  The level of short interest in tether is also difficult, if not impossible, to accurately measure. Much of the secondary market activity in the token takes place over-the-counter in private trades. And because one leg of the tether short involves simply borrowing the token, it can be difficult to distinguish even publicly visible shorts from other kinds of on-chain leverage.  This matters because shorting is often a collective activity – that is, traders may be more likely to short when they see others doing the same thing. This seemingly played a role in the TerraUSD depegging, for instance, which was closely observed on-chain.  There is a final sardonic twist to Tether’s strange defensive position: while regulatory anxiety may be driving some short interest, regulators are also partly responsible for making shorting tether harder.  “Ironically, one of the biggest forces protecting tether is the SEC,” Campbell argues. “By making it so hard for U.S. firms to interact with crypto at all, they have prevented price discovery, and prevented the largest players from coming in and doing these trades.”",NEGATIVE,USDT,MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | USDT | BTG,David Z.

Speculations and anticipation around BlackRock’s spot BTC application, and the recent WisdomTree and Invesco filing, could be driving the surge. Also, the just-launched Wall Street-backed crypto exchange EDX must have contributed, to a large extent, to the improved market sentiment. The total crypto market cap has already increased 5.74% in the last 24 hours as Bitcoin tallies a 7.94% gain over the same time frame, propelling its weekly gain to 11.73%. BCH Price Outlook Following the brief consolidation and sporadic price action triggered by heightened regulatory uncertainty, the bulls are leading the market. Assets prices ticked positive in the last 24 hours. As Bitcoin fights to break the $29,000 mark, its close relative, Bitcoin Cash, has put on an incredible performance in the background. Related Reading: Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) price has surged over 21.20% in the last day with the recent bullish momentum. The asset’s remarkable performance pushed it atop the chartsand it is now the top-gaining coin of the day, June 21, with a 22.10% price gain in the last seven days. Bitcoin Cash’s appearance on the EDX exchange boosted social sentiment, massively pushing network activity. The token trading volume has increased massively from $76.86 million, recorded yesterday, June 20, to $382 million today. The increase represents over 493% in 24 hours. Also, BCH trades at $129.21, with a 21.20% price increase over the past 24 hours. What’s Behind The Price Rally? One of the reasons for BCH’s performance is the newly launched crypto exchange, EDX, backed by Fidelity Investments, Charles Schwab, and other Wall Street market leaders. The crypto exchange went live today, June 21, and currently, it supports only Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). A crypto exchange supported by top Wall Street participants suggests more institutional investors and mainstream crypto adoption is underway. Now, investor sentiment has turned bullish following spot BTC ETF applications by three leading asset managers. According to reports, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF application encouraged two others (WisdomTree Investment and Invesco) to step forward. The world’s largest asset manager filed for a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 15. Related Reading: Why Are Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? You Need To Know This The SEC had previously denied the approval of other firms’ BTC ETF applications. However, many believe BlackRock would succeed due to its reputation and connections. This is also because BlackRock has a high success rate in previous ETF applications, hence the market’s optimism. An approved BTC spot ETF would boost Bitcoin’s legitimacy and encourage institutional investment, improving the asset market outlook. As such, the market sentiment rapidly shifted. On June 20, the Fear & Greed Index pointed towards “Neutral” but now flags Greed after today’s market rebound.

The BIS, which is regarded as the central bank of central banks described in a report detailing the future of the monetary system, that tokenization, or converting money and other assets into digital tokens that can be traded on programmable platforms, says it offers a “major leap” in the financial system. While advocating for a centralized option, the BIS described decentralized cryptocurrencies as a “flawed system.” Moreover, the report said: Crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) have offered a glimpse of tokenization’s promise, but crypto is a flawed system that cannot take on the mantle of the future of money. The BIS also further argued that “crypto has collapsed” and said the successful use of tokenization relies on the trust provided by central banks. The collapse of crypto and the faltering progress of other tokenization projects underline a key lesson: tokenization’s success rests on the foundation of trust provided by central bank money and its capacity to knit together key elements of the financial system. Tokenization is “The Next Logical Step” The bank further asserts that tokenization is “the next logical step” in asset transfer and digital record keeping. It said: Tokenization could dramatically enhance the capabilities of the monetary and financial system by harnessing new ways for intermediaries to interact in serving end users, removing the traditional separation of messaging, reconciliation and settlement. BIS Identifies Smart Contracts as a Significant Use Case of a Unified Ledger In making its case for a unified ledger, the BIS identified its potential use case. The bank identifies smart contracts which could open the door to new types of “arrangements and transactions that “could expand the universe of possible contracting outcomes.” The report outlines that smart contracts can overcome coordination problems frequently occurring in joint ventures. It states blockchain technology could add to the stability of bank funding and eliminate free-riding. A smart contract could specify that each participant contributes only a certain amount to a joint venture if all other participants also contribute, this way, free-riding is eliminated.

42410341,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJiDc,1687366182,Crypto and AI: Save Us From the Hype,"We’ve seen this before. A radical technological breakthrough spins off applications that promoters insist will revolutionize whatever industry they happen to be targeting. Breathless conferences promise that nothing will ever be the same again. Funding floods in at back-of-the-envelope valuations based on exponential growth. I could be talking about the crypto circuit circa 2016-17. But today, I’m talking about artificial intelligence (AI).  It’s hard to not be mesmerized by the AI attention is getting, and perhaps motivated by the inflated promises. The impact, even at this early stage, is exciting: The ability to interface with computing power using natural language is a massive productivity unlock, and the creativity boost through almost instant images and prose is both helpful and entertaining. And that’s just scratching the surface.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  But the hype we’re hearing around AI now is reminiscent of the hype we heard around crypto and blockchain years ago. That exuberance was misplaced, as is today’s. The impact of crypto and blockchain is real and will continue to evolve; it’s just not what some tried to sell the public in the early days. The same will happen with AI – the impact will be considerable, but the hype is setting the field up for disappointment.  Earlier this month, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) published a document on the topic, written by Marc Andreessen himself. He’s smart – I thought his January 2014 New York Times article titled “Why Bitcoin Matters” was an excellent meditation on how the technology combines with market forces, which laid out the potential at hand while not ignoring the risks.  But his latest AI piece has many cringe moments.  Here are some choice quotes:  “An even shorter description of what AI could be: A way to make everything we care about better.”  Am I the only one that sees the possibility that AI could get involved in everything we care about somewhat dystopian? And what does he mean by “better”? Better for whom?  “The AI tutor will be by each child’s side every step of their development, helping them maximize their potential with the machine version of infinite love.”  Oh my. This is scary.  “Every leader of people – CEO, government official, nonprofit president, athletic coach, teacher – will have the same. The magnification effects of better decisions by leaders across the people they lead are enormous, so this intelligence augmentation may be the most important of all.”  I’m crying.  “I even think AI is going to improve warfare, when it has to happen, by reducing wartime death rates dramatically.”  The internet was going to do that by moving warfare online. That didn’t work out, and let’s fervently hope no authority walks up to red lines thinking it's OK because there will be fewer deaths.  Echoes of blockchain buzz  Other claims I’m hearing attributed to AI that echo those bestowed upon blockchain and even the internet back in the day:  AI will ""permanently disrupt"" education. The internet arguably did this, but are people happy with the state of education these days?  AI will predict medical problems before they happen. Obviously, this would be amazing, but would better predictions improve diagnoses, or could they introduce more risks? If AI-powered medicine can save even one life then I’m all for it, but I worry about the general anxiety cost and the missed diagnoses because the predictive algorithm didn’t flag anything.  AI can help fight climate change. Faster information processing could help focus global prevention efforts. But what about all those guzzling data centers?  AI combined with nuclear fusion will make us a super-species. And facilitate intergalactic travel. No comment.  We will never have to worry again. This is from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI.  I could go on…  Perhaps I sound like a crypto enthusiast who hates the idea of another hot technology stealing our ecosystem’s thunder. Far from it – I hated the early-stage crypto hype as well, the promises that “blockchain will change everything!” and that “everything will be tokenized!” (And yes, I know that we’re still hearing some of these claims.)  Rather, I’m excited about AI. I see the problems as opportunities, and am looking forward to experimenting more over the summer to see how it can help with my newsletter.  See also: Why Web3 and the AI-Internet Belong Together | Opinion  Even more, I’m supportive of the migration of VC [venture capital] attention. You’ll probably have seen some of the tweets, quotes and interviews of prominent Silicon Valley representatives saying things like “If you’re in crypto, pivot to AI.” By all means, those venture capitalists that chase the latest technology should definitely do that. This would significantly reduce funding in the crypto ecosystem, but the crazy money that was being flung around a couple of years ago led to unrealistic valuations, unsustainable structures and some atrocious behavior.  A tighter funding environment will hopefully mean that startups or later-stage operations that do get funding will have a stronger product-market fit, run a leaner operation and as a result have a better chance of survival while not burning through easy VC cash.  The AI field has its pick of hypesters as well: the techno-utopians convinced that technology brings out our better natures, the visionaries who believe funding should be based on faith rather than utility, the consultants who want to frighten you into paying for their services.  If AI refuses the “hot” funding, plugs its ears to the hyperbole and casts off those only in it for the money, the crypto ecosystem will be stronger for it. The two technologies have their affinities. Blockchain promises will become more focused. The expected value can get more real.  The crypto ecosystem will benefit from the potential overlaps with AI, and there are many. These include easier coding for blockchain-based apps, decentralized storage for vast pools of data, shared incentives for sustainable power solutions for data centers are just the tip of an exciting pyramid of possible synergies.  See also: 10 Ways Crypto and AI Can Make Each Other Better  And crypto has a lot to offer AI. In particular, I venture applying lessons learned from the crypto hype could save founders and developers working with artificial intelligence from venturing into dead ends and overstatement. Vast opportunity is exhilarating, and if we don’t reach high, we’ll never know how high we can go. But too many broken promises weakens credibility, disillusions investors and gives detractors plenty of fuel.  The AI field probably has to go through its own trial by fire, though, and learn this for itself.  I applaud genuine excitement for the motivation it spreads and the hope it delivers. My concern is when that excitement becomes opportunistic and manipulative.

14053735,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=539035,1687365500,"Bitcoin Price Breaks Above $30,000: Is The Bull Run Back On?","Bitcoin price is back above $30,000 for the second time in 2023, with bulls hoping it not only holds this time, but leads to renewed confidence in the crypto market. Is this a sign the bear market is over and the bull run is back on? Or is this just a bear market rally that will result in new lows eventually? Let’s take a closer look at the latest price action. Bitcoin Price Reclaims $30,000 Following Shift In News Cycle Just a week ago, the SEC was waging a war against altcoins, and there was negative news around every turn for the crypto market. In a flash, the news cycle turned positive with a slew of Wall Street brands making their presence known in the crypto space. Names include BlackRock, Charles Schwab, Sequoia Capital, Fidelity, and others. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out Of Ichimoku Cloud, Storms Toward $28,000 Within days of the news making rounds, Bitcoin price is already back above $30,000 per coin, leaving bears who expected new lows bewildered and in disbelief. Bitcoin has reclaimed $30,000 | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Why $31,000 Is The Level To Watch With $30K Broken Not only is BTCUSD back above $30,000 per coin, but it is already quickly approaching $31,000. A higher high on any timeframe could send further confirmation to investors that a bottom is in for cryptocurrencies. Investors and traders who were too fearful to buy lower might finally see these levels as a safer entry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above Critical Level, Why Bulls Could Be Ready To Charge But Bitcoin isn’t yet out of the woods. $31,000 is the current local high for 2023, and that level must be taken out to further confirm an uptrend. An uptrend, by definition, is a series of higher highs and higher lows. With a higher low made at precisely $25,000 – the only thing that is missing is this higher high above $31,000.

However, companies like WisdomTree, Grayscale, and One River Asset Management only received the SEC’s rejection. However, the SEC’s denial didn’t deter WisdomTree as a June 21 Bloomberg report revealed that the asset manager filed another application with the SEC to launch its spot BTC ETF. The firm’s application comes a few days after BlackRock submitted its own, seeking approval for the same product. WisdomTree Reapplies For Spot BTC ETF Approval Despite Previous Rejections WisdomTree Investments had previously proposed to launch a spot BTC ETF with the SEC in 2021. However, the commission denied the company’s application in December 2021 after a prolonged delay in taking action. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Breaks Through Crucial Resistance Point With 10% Climb After the denial, WisdomTree, alongside One River, made changes to its proposal and resubmitted it to the SEC. However, in March 2022, the commission announced designating a longer period to decide on the proposed rule change. It noted that it needed ample time to consider the proposed change, including the accompanying comments. One would have expected WisdomTree to surrender after the prolonged delay and denial, but the latest development suggests otherwise. The Tuesday filing disclosed that the asset manager’s Bitcoin Trust would list on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the name BTCW if approved. The SEC has previously refused to allow such Bitcoin-based investment products, rejecting or ignoring applications from firms such as Grayscale, One River, and VanEck. It cited fraud and BTC spot market manipulation as reasons for not approving the spot-based BTC ETFs. Instead, the SEC allowed futures-based BTC ETFs. Notably, the manager of the largest Bitcoin Trust fund, Grayscale, had applied with the SEC to convert its private spot Bitcoin trust to spot ETF. But the commission rejected the move, enraging the firm to sue it for denying the application. BlackRock Raises Hope In Spot BTC Approval Last week, US’ leading asset manager BlackRock applied for the SEC’s approval to launch iShares Bitcoin Trust spot ETF. It appears that BlackRock’s application restored hope among previous applicants. Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, ETF analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, said: BlackRock’s spot BTC ETF filing “has restored hope in approval thanks to the company’s size, stature, and reputation.” Interestingly, some Bitcoin proponents threw weights behind BlackRock’s political affluence and power in the United States as an advantage. Related Reading: TUSD Emerges Strong: 1 Billion Injection Bolsters Supply Amidst Declining Stablecoin Market In a June 12 tweet, a notable Bitcoin proponent, Paine, while cheering BlackRock, expressed optimism that the firm would receive the SEC’s approval to launch its spot BTC ETF.

He also said the SEC’s stalling the approval of other firms’ applications was to ward off “undeserving frontrunners” and “let the anointed [BlackRock] have their due.” Featured image from Pixabay and chart from TradingView.com",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | SHIB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/wisdomtree-investments-joins-blackrock-files-for-bitcoin-etf/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Atrium, a network of independent Web3 artists and creators, has released the pilot for its episodic series ""Nouns: A Movie,"" turning the popular non-fungible token (NFT) collection into entertainment.  Led by former animators for Pixar, Netflix and Marvel, “The Rise of Blus: A Nouns Movie” is said to be the first animated film funded by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). The project has a budget of $2.75 million, given in tranches provided the team meets its goals.  According to a press release, the action comedy ""is set in the bustling, floating cloud city of Blus, where an audacious 13-year-old Noun discovers the plot of aristocrats to enslave its citizens and must team up with an unlikely band of misfits to save the ones they love.""  The NounsDAO community passed a proposal to fund the film in March. Atrium creatives William Yu, HKJay, Zen Doubt, 3DPrint Guy and Meta Ent are helping to write, produce and animate the film. The movie has been created by an entirely remote team, speeding up processes that would otherwise take months.  ""We are 10x-ing the speed of traditional studios because we can make decisions quickly and move forward in a more agile manner,” said Zen Doubt, who is also co-directing the movie, in a press release. One of the factors credited for the speed was that the production of the movie is fully remote, which also allows it to be produced at a lower cost than traditional methods.  Zen Doubt has been posting regular updates on the process on Twitter, including sharing information on which other projects influenced the film's animation style as well as inside information such as the Rorschach tests shown in the pilot were generated with AI.  Supriyo Roy, founder and CEO at Atrium, told CoinDesk that because the Nouns project has been released as open-source, the film's creators had the freedom to craft an entire world and storyline for the 8-bit characters without limitations.  ""There is no 'canon'"" said Roy. ""Nouns are an infinite brand machine. There is no official top-down directive of how things should be done.""  The pilot segment for the movie is available to watch through the Nouns Movie website.  The NounsDAO community continues to fund creative projects to expand its ecosystem, recently approving proposals for a comic book series with book publisher Titan Comics and NFT community ComicsDAO, along with a second ArtBall NFT collection with the Australian Open tennis tournament, OnCyber and Vayner Sports Pass.

EDX Markets launched its operations on Tuesday after it completed an investment round which saw it onboard new equity partners to join its founding investors Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets, Sequoia Capital, and Charles Schwab. EDX Will Allow Trading In BTC, ETH, LTC, and BCH In a press release, EDX explained that it offers a “non-custodial” model, meaning it does not hold clients’ digital assets. The platform instead works with a third-party custodian, said Chief Executive Officer Jamil Nazarali. The exchange also said it successfully conducted an investment round to add investors such as Miami International Holdings, DV Crypto, GTS, GSR Markets LTD, and HRT Technology. Nazarali said: EDX’s ability to attract new investors and partners in the face of sector headwinds demonstrates the strength of our platform and the demand for a safe and compliant cryptocurrency market. EDX further stated it aims to bring elements of traditional finance over to crypto, focusing on compliance and mitigating conflicts of interest. We are committed to bringing the best of traditional finance to cryptocurrency markets, with an infrastructure built by market experts to embed key institutional best practices. Unlike other crypto exchanges, EDX will only allow investors to trade four top cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). The platform’s CEO said EDX would soon launch a clearing house. With the endorsement of our new and growing list of investors and customers, we’re proud to launch trading and look forward to further enhancements to our offering. Looking ahead, EDX Clearing will be a major differentiator for EDX -- and resolve an unmet need in the market – by enhancing competition and creating unparalleled operational efficiency through a single settlement process.

The purchase was the latest step in Maker’s strategy, encapsulated by founder Rune Christensen’s “Endgame Plan,” to diversify the assets backing the $4.5 billion dollar-pegged stablecoin by increasing the role of traditional financial assets such as government bonds in the reserve.  The acquisition was part of a proposal approved in March to increase the upper limit of a real-world asset (RWA) vault that invests in short-term government bonds to $1.25 billion. The vault, one of the facilities that ensures DAI keeps its $1 price peg, is managed by asset manager Monetalis.  The platform is undergoing a restructuring that includes breaking up its structure into smaller, autonomous units called SubDAOs and investing in yield-generating, real-world assets to boost protocol revenue at a time when demand for crypto lending is modest.  “Through the diversification of its collateral pool with this U.S. Treasury ladder strategy, Maker is taking advantage of the current yield environment and putting its assets to work,” Monetalis CEO Allan Pedersen said in a statement.  The community recently approved the onboarding of a new RWA vault managed by crypto asset manager BlockTower, marking the first step towards an additional UST purchase of up to $1.28 billion in the future. Voting members also favored ditching $500 million of Paxos Dollar (USDP) and $390 million of Gemini Dollar (GUSD) from the reserve to pursue better yielding investments.",POSITIVE,DAI,FIAT | MKR | REGULATION | SPONSORED | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/makerdao-boosts-us-treasury-holdings-by-700m-to-back-dai-stablecoin-with-real-world-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f777d550860e854761387f613ba0d6231cb0dc81-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410336,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJhx5,1687361927,German Intelligence Agency Releases NFT Collection to Recruit Talent,"German Intelligence Agency Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) has released a non-fungible token (NFT) collection to recruit talent through a gamified blockchain treasure hunt.  The agency released “Dogs of BND” earlier this month, a collection of 999 generative dog-themed profile pictures (PFPs) donning cyber security-themed wearables. The NFTs can only be acquired by completing a cyber quest and locating a hidden string of characters in order to mint into the collection.  According to its website, German citizens who opt to hunt for the Dogs of BND collection must locate a strong of characters (in this case, a wallet address, transaction hash, block or token number) hidden by the federal agency as a clue. Once players find the correct data, they are given access to mint into the collection.  While the NFT costs less than 1 cent to mint (excluding gas fees), the collection’s floor price on secondary marketplace OpenSea is currently 0.045 ETH, or about $82. There are 999 NFTs in the collection, but only 987 are available for players to mint. The treasure hunt will end when all 987 tokens have been minted.  According to German cryptocurrency publication BTC Echo, the goal of the treasure hunt is to seek out young talent who are fluent in blockchain technology to help mitigate cybercrime. It's also tapped its Instagram following to do so, aiming to court users who are social media savvy and interested in NFTs.  “We are also looking for talents in the field of cyber security in the future,” the agency told BTC Echo. “So an NFT collection was an obvious new offering for our Instagram community.”  While the BND is integrating NFTs into its recruitment strategy, not all government agencies are suited to incorporate tokenized assets into their strategies. In April 2022, the U.K. government made plans to create an NFT through the Royal Mint. However, in March of this year, it canceled its plans to move forward with the NFT out of concern for speculation and financial risk.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/06/21/german-intelligence-agency-releases-nft-collection-to-recruit-talent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/30b5dd77b2294c205ec5e2226de35cba40000cdd-1280x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency has gained more than 10% over the past 24 hours. The last time bitcoin reached above $30,000 was on April of 2023, according to TradingView data.  ""It seems that the crypto market is going to be completely restructured in the country by the biggest investment firms in the near future,"" Ruslan Lienkha, chief of markets at Web3 crypto and fiat service provider YouHodler, wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""More investors will have access to crypto investments with much lower risks. Important to notice that a very small percentage of BlackRock or Fidelity clients interested in spot BTC ETFs are enough to move the price further north.""  The cryptocurrency's rally comes as several TradFi giants including BlackRock, Invesco and WisdomTree filed for spot bitcoin ETF applications. Meanwhile, EDX crypto exchange, which is backed by major TradFi players, also launched on Tuesday. The exchange is backed by Fidelity Digital Assets, Charles Schwab and Citadel Securities and will offer four tokens in the U.S., including bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash and litecoin. Bitcoin cash (BHC) has also rallied following the news, gaining 25% on the day.  Other developments include banking giant Deutsche Bank announcing Tuesday that it had applied for a digital asset custody license in Germany.  TradFi players appear not to be deterred by a regulatory crackdown from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against crypto exchanges.  In an email to CoinDesk, Leo Mizuhara, CEO of digital asset management platform Hashnote, wrote that the upswing ""surprised a lot of observers"" immersed in the ""regulatory doom and gloom"" that included Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuits earlier this month.  ""We’re experiencing a confluence of events that is shaping up to be bullish for Bitcoin and digital assets more generally,"" Mizuhara wrote. ""You now have institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity getting into the space in a significant way, and these moves appear not to have been priced in.""  Mizuhara added that ""the macro backdrop is shifting away from monetary tightening to one of loosening more generally, particularly in China but also, it seems, in the United States.

42410332,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJhjr,1687361400,‘Storage Proofs’ Touted as Alternative to Hack-Prone Bridges in Multichain World,"As new blockchains proliferate, users who want to swap assets between chains are dependent on bridges prone to problems and attacks.  Chainanalysis estimates that bridge attacks accounted for 69% of all cryptocurrency stolen in 2022, with over $2 billion siphoned from buggy cross-chain bridge platforms.  As blockchain developers increasingly recognize the problem of vulnerable bridges, some, like the Ethereum layer 2 network Starknet, are turning to “storage proofs” for help.  Storage proofs are a cryptographic method to allow users to “prove” that certain data, transactions or assets on a blockchain are true or valid, without having to rely on a third party.  “Today, you hand over money to third parties to transport over a bridge. Anyone can be lurking, waiting to ambush you and steal money,” Eli Ben-Sasson, co-founder of Starkware, the company behind the Starknet blockchain, explained in a statement. “Storage proofs will let you just press a button and more-or-less teleport liquidity from chain to chain. It’sa dramatic difference.”  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  According to Starknet, they will be the first network to have storage proofs natively integrated, after it goes through a security audit later this year. Currently, Starkware’s Goerli testnet has storage proofs built on it by a team called Herodotus, so project developers can experiment with the new setup.  Starkware is betting that rising demand for cross-chain transfers will soon bring storage proofs to more platforms.  How do Storage proofs work?  Storage proofs aim to enable “trustless”' cross-chain bridges, using cryptography to eliminate the need for third-party “oracles” to track assets between chains.  The method could be particularly useful for tracking assets between Ethereum and its growing community of “layer 2” chains – faster, cheaper networks that operate alongside Ethereum and rely on bridges to communicate with it and between each other.  With storage proofs, “You're basically proving mathematically – and using the integrity of math – to assert that you indeed own this asset on Ethereum,” Ben-Sasson told CoinDesk.”You don't need intermediaries, you just need the power of math.”  Ben-Sasson contends that storage proofs can, in some cases, even eliminate the need to transfer assets across different chains. Instead, users could use storage proofs to simply show on one chain that assets exist on another.  For instance, say a user has vote-bearing tokens on one blockchain, but a platform’s governance process takes place on another chain. The user can use a storage proof to show their assets on the first chain, and then vote on the second one, without having to move over the assets and pay high gas fees.  Why now?  One team working on storage proofs is Herodotus, which is focused on bringing them to Ethereum’s layer 2 platforms.  Cryptographic proofs, like storage proofs, can be quite large and complex for computers to verify, making them difficult for space-constrained blockchain networks to handle. Previously, “what really made storage proofs economically unfeasible, is the fact that all the computation had to happen on the blockchain,” said Kacper Koziol, co-founder of Herodotus.  Starkware turned to zero-knowledge (ZK) cryptography to address this issue when building its storage proofs, allowing for smaller and more efficient computation.  “We can simply prove that it was computed in a valid manner and just do the verification of the computation,” Koziol said.

""We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money, and in all advanced economies, the ultimate source of credibility in money is the central bank,"" Powell said in testimony today at a twice-yearly hearing on monetary policy. ""We believe it would be appropriate to have quite a robust federal role.""  Powell also noted that the Fed's staff has been involved in talks with lawmakers from both parties on the crypto legislation members of the committee have been working on. He observed in his testimony that the industry ""appears to have some staying power,"" though Powell also suggested the market has fallen sharply since last year.  The panel, led by Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), will be marking up two crypto bills in late July, McHenry said at the opening of the hearing. A markup is an open session that invites debate or edits to the details of a bill before it gets a committee vote, and McHenry said he’s scheduling the much-debated stablecoin legislation and a wider bill that would set the overall market structure and oversight for cryptocurrencies in the U.S.  Significant crypto legislation hasn’t yet cleared a committee in either the House or Senate in the years such efforts have been discussed.  In questioning Powell, the committee’s ranking Democrat, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), said the latest legislative proposal from Republicans would leave the Fed “severely hamstrung” and that it needs to establish a strong federal floor for oversight of nonbank stablecoin issuers. That’s been a sticking point since negotiations began in earnest last year, because Republicans have sought to ensure a major role for states as stablecoin watchdogs.  Powell also addressed the debate over whether the U.S. should establish a central bank digital currency, saying ""We're a long way from this.""  If the Fed were to set up a digital dollar, Powell said the central bank has no interest in managing retail accounts.  ""We would not support accounts at the federal reserve by individuals,"" he said. Instead, such accounts would be managed through the banking system, Powell said.

42410340,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJiAJ,1687359616,Struct Finance Rolls Out Customizable Interest Rate Product for DeFi Users,"Struct Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that allows investors to trade tailored structured financial products linked to crypto, has released its interest rate vault and “tranching” mechanism.  The firm will include different tokens, tokenized derivatives, vaults, pools in a permissionless manner to craft new products tailored to the investor’s risk appetite, according to a press release.  “The new interest rate products allow anyone to split and repackage the risk of any yield-bearing DeFi assets in different parts to fit their risk profile through an innovative process called ‘tranching’,” said the press release.  The products are a single vault split into two portions, or tranches that have different returns. Firstly, a fixed-return tranche for conservative investors looking for consistent returns. Secondly, a variable-return for investors with higher risk appetite.  The yield from the underlying asset flows into the fixed tranche to ensure predictable returns, while the remainder is allocated to the variable tranche, which gets enhanced exposure to the underlying yield-bearing asset, said the press release.  “The lack of fixed-yield returns in crypto has been a deterrent to entry of both larger institutions and smaller players with more conservative risk appetites,” said the press release. “Considering the Struct Factory allows permissionless tranching of liquidity pools, fixed rate returns may become commonplace enough to tame the wild and volatile returns of Web3.”  Struct Finance is currently available on layer-1 protocol Avalanche.

14051380,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538940,1687359611,"MATIC Price Gains Momentum, But Bulls Face Uncertainty Without Breaking Vital Resistance","The price of MATIC has experienced an increase in recent trading sessions, surpassing its important support level. In the past 24 hours, the MATIC price has risen by approximately 6%. However, when considering the weekly chart, the altcoin has not shown significant value growth. The technical outlook for MATIC remains bearish, indicating negative sentiment. Both the demand and accumulation for MATIC have remained relatively low, indicating a prevailing bearish influence. The volatility of Bitcoin has had a negative impact on the stability of most altcoins in recent trading sessions. So for MATIC to continue appreciating in future trading sessions, there needs to be a recovery in demand for the altcoin, and its price must trade above the resistance level of $0.70. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal Moreover, the overall strength of the broader market is also crucial for MATIC. The market capitalization of MATIC has declined, suggesting that sellers currently have control over the price. MATIC Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, MATIC was trading at $0.64. Following its drop below the $0.90 price level, the altcoin has been experiencing a downtrend, but there have been attempts by the bulls to reverse this trend. The key resistance level for MATIC is currently set at $0.70, and if the price manages to surpass this level, it would provide an opportunity for the bulls to gain control. However, if the price fails to breach the $0.70 resistance, it could weaken the momentum and potentially cause MATIC to fall below its immediate support line. The nearest support levels are located at $0.60 and then at $0.57. It is worth noting that MATIC has formed a symmetrical pattern, and recently broke out from it, indicating a potential incoming bullish trend. Technical Analysis Despite a slight increase in demand, MATIC is still under the influence of bearish market sentiment. This is evident in the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which is below the 50-mark and only slightly above the 30-mark. These RSI levels indicate a strong selling influence in the market. Furthermore, the altcoin has dropped below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which suggests that demand for the altcoin is still low. This decline below the SMA line also indicates that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. On the daily chart, the altcoin has shown mixed signals, including some buy signals. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator indicates momentum and potential shifts. It has recently formed one green signal, which is tied to a buy signal for the altcoin. This suggests a possibility of bullishness in the near term. However, for the bullish scenario to strengthen, the altcoin needs to reclaim the $0.70 level. This price level is important for the altcoin to gain upward momentum. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands, which measure volatility and price fluctuation, are currently wide apart. This indicates an expectation of increased price volatility in the market.

In a significant development, the company has introduced a notable 10% burn mechanic designed to enhance the deflationary attribute of its native 3ULL coin strategically. This move guarantees to increase the coin's scarcity over time. All in-game assets in the PLAYA3ULL GAMES ecosystem are held in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The burn mechanic will apply to all NFTs sold from the PLAYA3ULL GAMES Marketplace, encouraging a cycle where heightened community activity expedites the 3ULL coin burn, boosting its rarity and value. Transitioning to the Avalanche Subnet allows PLAYA3ULL GAMES to maintain the robust security of the Avalanche Blockchain while implementing its new blockchain. This independent blockchain will host all nodes essential for the daily production of 3ULL coins and will serve as the bedrock of the PLAYA3ULL GAMES ecosystem. With 4,400 nodes already sold out of a total of 50,000, each node delivers a daily reward of 1,500 3ULL coins, a substantial incentive for potential node operators, strengthening the network. This movement to an Avalanche Subnet, coupled with the introduction of a deflationary coin-burn mechanic, marks a new era of growth for PLAYA3ULL GAMES. These pioneering moves reinforce PLAYA3ULL GAMES' commitment to reshaping the gaming industry by offering exceptional opportunities to its expanding community.

42410334,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJhqT,1687359600,Bitcoin Custody Firm Casa Rolls out Ethereum Support,"Casa, a popular cryptocurrency self-custody firm historically focused exclusively on the Bitcoin blockchain, added support for Ethereum on Wednesday, completing an expansion plan announced late last year.  The fully revamped Casa app now provides private key management services for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), with support for other Ethereum-related assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), ERC-20 tokens and stablecoins, in the cards for future rollouts.  Large centralized platforms have historically been the go-to custody solutions for crypto consumers due to their ease of use. But last year’s collapse of entities such as Celsius, BlockFi, FTX, along with the current legal woes besetting two of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges – Binance and Coinbase – have left those consumers skittish, with billions being withdrawn from centralized platforms after each scandal.  Read more: SEC Clampdown Spurs $4B Deposit Flight From Binance, Coinbase and Binance.US  Companies like Jack Dorsey’s financial-technology firm Block (SQ) have started moving into the self-custody space, and now Casa, a five-year veteran of the area, is reasserting its position in digital self-custody by offering private-key management services – previously only available to bitcoin customers – to ether holders as well.  “Securing ETH has consistently been our most frequent customer request,” Casa CEO Nick Neuman told CoinDesk. “That was the core driver behind the decision to build Ethereum support in the first place.”  Casa’s services primarily rely on multisignature or “multisig” functionality. Multisig crypto wallets require more than one signature to spend funds. A Casa user holding ether in a 2-of-3 multisig would have three potential keys that could sign transactions but only two would be required to sign at any given time.  That means a user could keep and use two keys, hand off the third to Casa for safekeeping, and if that user loses one key, Casa would help sign transactions with the third key in its custody, ensuring the user’s funds remain accessible.  “We've seen all the problems that come from using centralized custodians,” Neuman said. “We've seen how important it is to get the average person holding their own keys. We're just providing the software to make it easier to use those keys.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BNB,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/06/21/bitcoin-custody-firm-casa-rolls-out-ethereum-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2663c2541951fe57835b5c63bb7c033a10025b0a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Gates has already warned that the world should expect to see many major changes within a few years. The InQubeta presale is attracting lots of global investors as it’s the first platform to create a simpler yet secure way for anyone, anywhere to buy equity in artificial intelligence startups. InQubeta isn’t the only AI-linked altcoin that has been getting lots of attention lately. Others like Fetch.ai and Singlularity.NET are also seeing an influx of bullish investors. Even mainstream corporations that help to push innovations like Nvidia, which provides chips for AI software, have also seen a substantial increase in investment funds. Nvidia recently became a trillion-dollar corporation after announcing that the demand for chips that power AI software has increased by over 50%. InQubeta emerges as leader of AI cryptocurrencies Also known as machine learning, artificial intelligence is a type of software system that’s based on neural networks. The technique was created decades ago, but couldn’t be used to its full potential until new computing resources were developed. Thanks to AI, vehicles with self-driving capabilities are already being mass-produced and many people have smartphones with effective image and voice recognition tools. Companies like Tesla® are already working on humanoid robots that can perform manual labor and domestic tasks. Even Wall Street has been firmly behind the AI revolution, with investments in the sector rising by over $100 billion from 2015 to 2022. Total investments in firms linked to AI are predicted to exceed $1.5 trillion by 2030. A large portion of these funds will go into AI-linked cryptocurrencies. The top ten ones are: 1. InQubeta (QUBE) InQubeta (QUBE) provides a platform that allows startups that focus on artificial intelligence to connect with potential investors. It bypasses the barriers associated with conventional investment channels like needing Silicon-Valley-type connections or being able to afford minimum account deposits that exceed the average person’s annual income. Firms raise money on the InQubeta platform by creating non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that denote equity and other bonuses in their companies. The NFTs are fractionalized, allowing investors to invest as little or as much as they want. They become equity-owning associates, while the company gets the capital it needs to innovate. Transactions are done with the platform’s native currency, $QUBE tokens. AI is expected to be, at the very least, as disruptive as the Internet revolution was. Those who invested in companies that quickly capitalized on the new opportunities created by the internet have made substantial returns on their investments since. For example, a $10,000 investment in Amazon during its initial public offering in 1997 would be worth more than $2.2 million today. Thanks to InQubeta, everyone can now invest in companies that will push innovations in the sector. InQubeta investors can earn extra bonuses by staking their $QUBE to help secure and run the blockchain. Rewards are sent periodically from a dedicated pool that is funded with a 5% sell levy on all $QUBE transactions. $QUBE tokens also give investors access to the platform’s governance, allowing them to suggest and vote on issues that affect the project’s development and future. Visit InQubeta Presale 2. Fetch.ai (FET) Fetch.ai is another interesting AI-driven cryptocurrency platform that has been getting lots of attention lately. It aims to automate web transactions on its decentralized platform. Each user gets a digital version of themselves called a ‘digital twin’ that learns, interacts, and negotiates with the digital twins of goods or service providers. Digital twins use set parameters given by users to negotiate on their behalf. For example, a user’s digital twin might interact with the digital twins of concert ticket sellers to find the best deals for a specific event. These digital twins can also interact with other digital twins that have performed similar tasks in the past and learn from them. Fetch.ai digital twins can also be used for decentralized financial services. For example, a user’s digital twin can notice price differences of a specific token on different cryptocurrency exchanges and take advantage of them autonomously. Bill Gates recently predicted that services like the ones provided by Fetch.ai would be the first to cause major disruptions as it has the potential to change how people shop online. 3. Singlularity.NET (AGIX) Singularity.Net is a decentralized AI marketplace that uses blockchain technology to provide unrestricted access to applications and algorithms. One of the platform’s main goals is to create Artificial General Intelligence from all the interactions between different AI algorithms. Singularity.NET hosts its platform on the Cardano (ADA) and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains and anyone can use the learning models created on it. Its native currency the AGIX is used to pay transaction fees and purchase products. Over 70 AI services are already available on the platform and the user-friendly interface makes it easy for non-developers to navigate the space. 4. The Graph (GRT) The Graph provides a system for querying and indexing data from blockchains, much like a search engine’s index and query data from websites. The Graph’s platform does this by organizing data into subgraphs. It’s built on the Ethereum blockchain and it allows anyone to build and publish APIs that applications can query with GraphQL to secure blockchain data. Visit InQubeta Presale 5. Ocean Protocol (OCEAN) Ocean Protocol provides an Ethereum-based platform that allows individuals and businesses to monetize and exchange data and data-based services. For example, it can give researchers access to the data without the data holder having to relinquish it. While many cryptocurrencies had a rough time in 2022, Ocean prices kept growing before finally coming down in early 2023. 6. Cortex (CTXC) Cortex provides a peer-to-peer, open-source, decentralized blockchain-based platform that supports uploading and executing AI models on the distributed network. It aims for AI democratization where models can be integrated into smart contracts to create AI-powered decentralized applications. Cortex hasn’t enjoyed the price growth many other AI-driven cryptocurrencies have recently seen, but it has the potential to create a new class of decentralized applications and smart contracts in the future. 7. iExec RLC (RLC) IExec offers a blockchain network that users can use to monetize their computing power or access on-demand computing resources. RLC is the network's native currency and it’s used to pay transaction fees on the blockchain. The iExec platform is currently the leading blockchain-based decentralized computing platform and it also allows users to monetize data sets and applications. iExec supports applications used in various fields like fintech, rendering, AI, and healthcare. iExec aims to reinvent the cloud computing space by creating a new blockchain-based cloud paradigm. iExec’s platform relies on XtremWeb-HEP, which is an open-source grid software that allows for features like security, data management, private infrastructure, and the development of virtual images. Visit InQubeta Presale 8. Numeraire (NMR) Numeraire runs an AI-powered blockchain network that acts like a hedge fund on behalf of users, using machine learning and artificial intelligence to invest in global stock markets. Its native currency the Numeraire is used to pay transaction fees on the network. The Numeraire blockchain is Ethereum-based, allowing data scientists and developers to experiment and develop machine learning models. The platform aims to decentralize the data science field while allowing developers to make more effective machine-learning models. Numeraire claims the title of being the first hedge fund to launch its cryptocurrency, but unlike conventional hedge funds, it uses predictions made by users to select stocks. It heavily relies on machine learning for its investment strategies. 9. dKargo (DKA) dKargo is a blockchain network that uses artificial intelligence to address issues in the logistics industry by providing credible data to participants. The network also helps to establish efficient logistics networks based on improved communication provided by blockchain technology. The dKargo platform helps to address trust issues created by split logistic nodes by using blockchain technology to enhance communication and create collaboration-based logistic networks that would be impossible without blockchain technology. The platform also provides Web3 logistic services. It gives users optimized routes and logistics that couldn’t have been possible with the structure of silo logistics. 10. Phala Network (PHA) Phala Network also provides AI-augmented blockchain-based cloud computing services, but its main focus is privacy. The platform is positioned as a decentralized alternative to traditional cloud computing providers like Google Cloud or Amazon AWS. PHA is its native currency and used for various things like purchasing computing resources, paying data exchange fees, and security guarantees. Phala Network provides users with contract-based data exchange infrastructure for standardized trading protocols, analysis, and collection. PHA also serves as the platform’s governance tokens giving users a say in the platform’s development and operations. Summary 2023 has been the year of AI-linked cryptos as they emerge as the top altcoins to buy. Investors remain bullish on these tokens that are driven by artificial intelligence while generally feeling bearish about most cryptocurrencies. AI-linked cryptos are taking over the crypto space and their futures look bright with a total of $1.5 trillion expected to be funneled into the AI sector.

It may ""make sense"" for the Fed to raise rates at a ""more moderate pace"" than it has in the past 15 months, he said. Earlier, Powell in his statement repeated the expectation that rates will rise more this year . ""Regulations should be transparent, consistent and not too volatile,"" Powell said in his semi-annual monetary policy testimony at the House of Representatives when asked about his thinking in terms of evaluating capital requirements on banks. The Fed will look at what levels of capital increases would be justified, he said. There's a question of ""weighing and balancing"" costs of increasing capital requirements. Still, the central bank needs to make sure Fed rule changes avoid hurting small banks. 1:09 PM ET: Hearing concludes. 12:56 PM ET: Powell said there will be commercial real estate losses related to the office sector for some banks.

The proposal will then be subject to public comment and analysis. 12:47 PM ET: During FOMC meetings, the Fed isn't considering climate change as currently affecting inflation and wouldn't change its inflation goal due to climate change. 12:42 PM ET: It will take ""some softening of the labor market for inflation to come down"" closer to the Fed's 2% inflation goal. He wouldn't use the word ""pause"" to describe the Fed's rate action last week. Powell pointed out that the majority of FOMC members expects two more rate hikes by the end of this year. 12:33 PM ET: ""2% [inflation] is our goal and will remain our goal — that's in the medium-term,"" Powell said, remaining adamant that the Fed won't consider changing that target as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. 12:23 PM ET: ""As long as we're a country with a rule of law,"" democratic institutions, and open capital markets, the U.S. dollar can continue to be the world's reserve currency, Powell said. 12:19 PM: ""We don't see it as appropriate to tell banks what businesses they can lend to,"" he said when asked about the Fed's role in climate change risk. ""It's another risk"" that over time banks need to assess. 12:13 PM: Powell reiterated that the Fed doesn't comment on fiscal policy. ""We don't support it, we don't criticize it,"" he said. 12:10 PM ET: ""Overwhelmingly,"" smaller banks wanted the Fed to launch the FedNow real-time payment service, Powell said, in defending the introduction of FedNow, which will start this summer . The central bank feels it can master implementing ""very high levels of security"" to fight fraud when starting the service, he said. Even with the hearing's talk about potential increases in bank capital requirements, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index ( BKX ) is still in the green, up 0.2% in Wednesday midday trading. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF ( XLF ) gained 0.3% . 11:44 AM ET: An increase in labor force participation and immigration is making it a little easier for employers to find workers, he said. 11:42 AM ET: ""Our recovery by far is the strongest of any country,"" he said. Meanwhile, almost every other nation is also experiencing high inflation. 11:40 AM ET: ""We would not support accounts by individuals at the Federal Reserve,"" Powell said. If the central bank were to issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) it would be through bank intermediation, not directly through the Fed, he said. 11:37 AM ET: The Fed doesn't consider the bank capital requirements as affecting the inflation rate, he said. It will be a year or two before any new bank capital requirements take effect. 11:34 AM ET: Powell describes the balance that needs to be reached in setting bank capital requirements, so that banks have enough capital to lend even during stressful times. 11:31 AM ET: ""This economy is very strong, and what's driving it is a very strong labor market,"" Powell said. People, though, are still ""really concerned"" about inflation. While the Fed still has a ""ways to go"" to bring inflation down to 2%, it is making progress. 11:28 AM ET: Once the Fed's proposal is out on banks' capital levels are out, ""we can have lots of conversations,"" Powell said. So far, no proposal has been made to the Fed's board. The Fed is expected to consider the bank capital proposal this summer. He added that there will be a long comment period after any proposal is made. 11:19 AM ET: The Fed's balance sheet is a concern, and that's why the Fed's pace of shrinking it is faster than it was in the last cycle, Powell said. The central bank needs to have ample reserves plus a buffer. It's moving ""smartly"" toward that level, he added. 11:15 AM ET: Regarding the failure of Silicon Valley Bank: ""Interest risks is one of the most basic banking risks,"" he said. ""Management failed to hedge against those losses"" and didn't have enough liquidity. 11:13 AM ET: The current economic situtation is unusual in that ""we are overachieving"" on the maximum employment goal and underachieving on inflation. So at this point, the Fed needs to focus on inflation, he said. 11:10 AM ET: ""The status of the United States dollar as the world's reserve currency is very important to us,"" and he expects the U.S. dollar to remain the world's reserve currency. 11:06 AM ET: ""U.S. banks have competed very, very successfully"" during the recent stress, partly due to regulations that increased banks' capital requirements. ""The capital hikes we made in the last cycle look pretty good"" now, he noted. 11:04 AM ET: ""We [the Fed] have quite a narrow role to play in climate change,"" he said. Legislators should be the ones to make decisions on broader climate change policy, he said. 11:01 AM ET: Powell defended the Fed's and other regulators' move to grant an systemic risk exemption for the FDIC to insure uninsured deposits at Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. ""It was an emergency situation,"" he said. 10:58 AM ET: ""We're very focused on the commercial real estate market,"" Powell said. Supervisors of smaller banks are focused on those with a concentration of commercial real estate loans. 10:54 AM ET: ""Gradually, businesses are reporting they're better able to find workers,"" but the labor market is still very tight, he said. There's still a large gap between number of job openings and the number of workers available to fill them: ~1.6-1.7 job openings per worker available, down from 2 job openings per worker about two years ago. 10:49 AM ET: Powell declined to comment on whether he thinks banks' capital requirements need to be increased. He's waiting to see what the Fed review's proposals are. 10:47 AM ET: ""We need to update"" the Fed's approach to liquidity issues, he said. The Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank failures were all partly a result of liquidity issues, he said. ""Liquidity regulations"" weren't strong enough, he added. 10:44 AM ET: In discussing the mid-sized regional banks that failed earlier this year, there needs to be ""stronger supervision"" for banks of ""this size,"" he said. 10:40 AM ET: Republican representatives question Powell about the Fed's ""so-called holistic"" review of banks' capital requirements. Powell said the biggest U.S. banks are ""very strongly capitalized,"" are competitive globally, and are near the top of the league tables. 10:36 AM ET: The Fed should have a strong role in regulating stablecoins, Powell said. ""We do see payment stablecoins as a form of money.""

14050693,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/bitcoin-and-tradecurve-technical-indicators-showing-bullish-signs,1687357800,Bitcoin and Tradecurve technical indicators showing bullish signs,"The cryptocurrency market has gone through peaks and valleys, but recent developments indicate potential bullish trends for Bitcoin and Tradecurve. Bitcoin, the pioneer cryptocurrency, and Tradecurve, a promising hybrid trading platform currently in its presale phase, have garnered attention from traders and investors. This article will explore the technical indicators that suggest a bullish outlook for these digital assets and what they could mean for the future. >>BUY TCRV TOKENS NOW Bitcoin (BTC) could see a surge in the making After a significant price fall, Bitcoin, sometimes seen as the leading indicator of the cryptocurrency market, has been in a period of consolidation. However, many technical indications suggest that there may be a positive reversal soon. Bitcoin is on the verge of a bullish crossover, indicating a potential upward trend. Not only that, but the Bitcoin RSI is also in the buy zone, as it currently has a value of 65.802. With nearly all moving averages and technical indicators for Bitcoin showing buy signals, the future of this token looks bright. Currently, Bitcoin has a value of $26,550.91 with a market cap of $515B, which is a rise of 4.06% in the last 24 hours. Moreover, Bitcoin has witnessed a notable increase in trading volume in recent weeks, indicating renewed market activity. Overnight, the trading volume of Bitcoin increased by 29.75% and now sits at $17,289,847,477. Experts have noticed these technical indicators as they forecast a rise to $27,000 once more for Bitcoin by the end of 2023. Tradecurve (TCRV) builds momentum for growth Tradecurve, a borderless, Ethereum-based trading platform aiming to disrupt the traditional financial landscape, is showing promising signs of growth. Let’s go over some key indicators supporting its bullish outlook. The number of registered users on Tradecurve has been steadily increasing, reflecting growing interest and adoption of the platform. Recently, the Tradecurve team announced that they had surpassed 10,000 registered users, and for a project that is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, that number is astonishing. As more users join the ecosystem, it creates a network effect that can attract additional traders. Tradecurve boasts a robust hybrid infrastructure model that facilitates efficient trading and ensures a seamless user experience. With a focus on security, speed, and user-friendly features, Tradecurve is well-positioned to attract and retain traders. The best aspects of DEX and CEX will be implemented on Tradecurve, meaning users will find low latency, access to multiple asset classes, decentralized asset and key control, fast order execution, and more on one platform. One of Tradecurve’s main selling points is the removal of sign-up KYC checks. Users must frequently produce personal identifying papers, like passports or driver’s licenses, to undergo KYC checks and prove their identity on centralized exchanges. This procedure brings up privacy issues and the possible misuse of personal data. Users may keep their privacy and secure their sensitive data by forgoing the necessity for KYC checks. Other notable features that benefit all traders, novice or experienced, will be the ability to trade all derivatives on one account, algorithmic trading, high leverage (beginning at 500:1), negative balance protection, and a Proof of Reserves (PoR) implementation. Tradecurve’s utility token, TCRV, will be a critical component of this ecosystem and bring holders various perks such as discounts on subscriptions for the AI-powered trading bots, governance voting rights letting you choose how the platform will develop, passive income via staking and more. Currently, the TCRV token has a value of only $0.018, up 20% in the last week. If we look at the market cap of Tradecurve, which now sits at $32M as the token supply is 1.8B, we can deduce that it will see a much faster surge than Bitcoin as a lower amount of new funds will be needed. Only 40% of the 1.8B token supply will be available during its presale, and with experts predicting a 50x increase by the time it ends, purchasing it now may put you in the proper position before it spikes.

PEPE, the popular meme coin that uses a frog as its mascot gained widespread popularity in 2023 after a successful initial coin offering that sold out. However, PEPE iaccumilation has slowed down and that make space for other coins on the rise, investors have been quick to accumulate large amounts of DigiToads, one of PEPE's rivals that uses the toad as its mascot. DigiToads Presale Is Almost Sold Out DigiToads presale, which started a few weeks back, has been one of the hottest presales in 2023. Now in its Lilypad 8 stage, the presale has raised more than 4.85 million after selling more than 90% of the tokens allocated for the presale. As the launch of the $TOADS tokens approaches, investors have continued to show support for the project by purchasing TOADS tokens in chunks. The fast presale growth of the DigiToads presale has led investors to predict a bright future for the token that includes massive growth of more than 1000%. Some market analysts even suggest that TOADs will quickly climb the ranks of cryptocurrencies and soon rank among the top fifty and then the top ten cryptocurrencies by market cap. >> Buy DigiToads Now Why are investors so bullish about DigiToads? Well, DigiToads is a meme coin that stands out from the rest of the meme coins in the market, while most meme coins such as PEPE focus fully on the fun aspect and growing a community, DigiToads offers much more utility. This means that, unlike other meme coins that have to rely on community sentiment for value, the value of DigiToads is derived from the utility it offers investors. Some of the features that differentiate DigiToads from other meme coin projects include a robust play-to-earn platform, deflationary nature, NFTS staking, a metaverse, and environmental consciousness. The play-to-earn web3 gaming platform on DigiToads provides TOADs token holders with an immersive gaming experience that also rewards them with TOADs tokens for their efforts. In the game, players can collect, nurture and breed digital pet NFTS. Once a month, players battle their DigiToads against those of other players in a fierce competition where the top 25% of winners get rewards in the form of TOADs tokens. Players can use their rewards to enhance their rewards through staking, purchase more in-game items or buy more NFTs. DigiToads is also getting recognition in the NFT space with the introduction of its NFT staking platform. Users have the opportunity to stake their TOADS NFTS and earn additional rewards. The longer they take their NFTS, the greater the rewards they earn. The staking pool receives funds from 2% of all TOADS transactions, ensuring a steady supply of rewards for participants in the staking process. Another aspect of the DigiToads platform that has continued to attract investors is the monthly trading competitions. Once a month, DigiToads will hold a competition where traders will be required to show their trading skills and expertise. The winners will receive prestigious DigiToads, which give them access to funds in the treasury. There will be 12 DigiToads available each year, and they will serve to ensure that only the top traders have control and access to the treasury, while also motivating other traders to sharpen their trading skills. DigiToads will also play a role in conserving the environment by Donating 2.5% of its profits each month to a charity that is focused on conserving the Amazon rainforest and other natural habitats of wildlife like TOADs. This is a massive step in the right direction for DigiToads as it differentiates the project from other cryptocurrencies that have a rap for leaving a large carbon footprint. >> Buy DigiToads Now Final Word From an exciting metaverse to a rewarding play-to-earn game, staking and deflationary properties, DigiToads has all it needs to take off fast the most profitable crypto project of 2023, as an investor, this is your chance to hop on the DigiToads bandwagon and prepare yourself for insane growth.

The technical white paper produced with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Banca d’Italia, Bank of Korea, financial institutions and fintech firms proposes a common protocol that ""specifies the conditions upon which an underlying digital money can be used.""  The MAS said retailer Amazon.com (AMZN), finance company FAZZ and superapp creator Grab are collaborating on a pilot to test escrow arrangements for online retail transactions, with payments released to the merchant only after the customer receives the items purchased. The white paper covers technical specifications as well as ""business and operating models for how arrangements could be programmed,"" to specify validity periods or types of shops when making transfers.  The paper notes that the programmability of digital money is a point of contention. EU regulators for instance, have added a provision to digital euro legislation specifying such a currency would not be programmable because it could limit the freedoms of use afforded by cash.  ""Operators will need to ensure that programmability does not come at the expense of digital money’s ability to serve as a medium of exchange,"" the white paper said. ""The singleness of money should be preserved, and programmability should not limit the distribution of money and lead to fragmentation of liquidity in the system.""  The protocol is designed to work with different ledger technology and forms of money, the paper said, adding that with the standardized format, users will be able to ""access digital money using the wallet provider of their choice.""  “This collaboration among industry players and policymakers has helped achieve important advances in settlement efficiency, merchant acquisition, and user experience with the use of digital money. More importantly, it has enhanced the prospects for digital money becoming a key component of the future financial and payments landscape,"" Sopnendu Mohanty, MAS' chief fintech officer, said in a statement.

14049963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538907,1687356032,Bitcoin Investors Become Greedy For First Time Since May,"Data shows the Bitcoin investor sentiment has turned to greed for the first time since May as the asset’s price has shot up towards the $29,000 level. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Pointing At “Greed” Now The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator that tells us about the general sentiment among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from 0-100 for representing this sentiment. All values of the index above the 54 mark imply that the investors are greedy right now, while those below 46 suggest the presence of fear in the market. The in-between region (values 47-53) signifies a neutral mentality. Besides these core sentiments, there are also two special ones, called “extreme fear” and the “extreme greed.” The former occurs at values of the indicator below 25, while the latter takes place at values above 75. Historically, these two extreme sentiments have been quite significant for the market as bottoms and tops have tended to take place during periods of extreme fear and extreme greed, respectively. Now, here is what the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index looks like right now, according to data from Alternative: The market seems to be greedy at the moment | Source: Alternative As you can see above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index has a value of 59 currently. This suggests that the majority of the investors hold a sentiment of greed right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Continue To Accumulate As BTC Makes Recovery Push This is a fresh change, however, as the indicator had lesser values during the last few weeks. The below chart shows how the metric’s value has changed over the past year. Looks like the indicator has observed a spike in recent days | Source: Alternative From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin fear and greed index had seen a plunge during early May and had fallen down to neutral territory. In the weeks that followed, the metric had only managed to break into the greed territory just once (16 May) and had instead gone down into the fear zone on a couple of occasions. This worsening of the market sentiment had naturally come alongside the price of the asset registering a decline, as investors weren’t quite sure if bullish winds would return to the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Deposit To Exchanges, What Does This Mean? In the past day, however, the investor mentality has notably improved, as only yesterday the index had a value of 49, implying that the investors had been neutral. This strong uplift in the sentiment towards greed has occurred as Bitcoin has observed a strong surge, which has taken the price near the $29,000 level. The improvement in the mentality can be a positive sign for the rally, as it implies that the general investor is supportive of the current price increase. If the indicator continues to rise in the coming days and enters into the extreme greed territory, however, it might fire back for the asset. As mentioned before, high levels of greed have generally led to top formations for the asset. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,900, up 11% in the last week.

14049728,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/csa-warns-against-fake-crypto-regulatory-stamps,1687355340,CSA Warns Against Fake Crypto Regulatory Stamps,"The Canadian regulator has warned investors that some crypto websites use fake regulatory stamps and dispute resolution organizations to appear legitimate. Canadian Regulator Issues Investor Alert In a recent development, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) have issued an investor alert warning individuals about certain cryptocurrency websites that employ deceptive tactics to boost their credibility, deceive potential investors, and get them to deposit funds on fraudulent platforms. The investor alert released by the CSA stated, “In an effort to appear legitimate, the purported trading service providers claim they are certified by a fictitious authority or that they are members of a dispute resolution organization. One of them says its fictitious certification makes it “a reliable and trustable online trading platform.” Some of the purported trading services’ websites include links to these fake regulatory or dispute resolution organizations, which have their own websites.” Canada Faces Fake Regulator Scam The investor alert revealed that the fake regulatory certificates utilized by these platforms are designed to resemble those issued by genuine regulatory authorities. They also create fictitious dispute resolution organizations, which purportedly serve as independent entities for conflict resolution between investors and the platforms, further complicating the identification of scams. These organizations, however, do not exist in reality, leaving investors without legitimate avenues for complaint and redress. CSA Warns Against Crypto “Red Flags” Therefore, although an initial glance at the fraudulent platforms might not pick up anything problematic, a deeper analysis unveils the more common “red flags” like awkward language, spelling and grammatical errors, unpolished syntax, promises of high returns with minimal risk, and so on. The CSA warned investors to verify the authenticity of regulatory certificates by cross-referencing them with official regulatory databases and conducting independent research. The organization also advised investors to consult with registered financial advisors or even follow the list of crypto platforms registered by the CSA before depositing their hard-earned money on any platform. Too Tough On Crypto? The organization has also listed some fictitious regulatory bodies and organizations being named by these fraudulent platforms to fake legitimacy. The country’s strict regulatory environment has been challenging for many crypto firms, like Kraken, that had to jump through hoops to finally get the green signal from the country’s regulatory watchdog. Other companies like Binance, ByBit, and dYdX have felt compelled to leave the company after being exposed to the highly unfavorable regulatory environment.

42410330,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJhdF,1687354524,Binance Will Expand Zero-Fee Trading on TrueUSD after Minting $1B of TUSD,"Crypto exchange Binance will expand its zero-fee trading promotion to all trueUSD (TUSD) trading pairs starting June 30, the firm announced on Wednesday.  The blog post said that traders will benefit from zero maker fees with all TUSD spot and margin trading pairs, expanding the promotion from the bitcoin (BTC)-TUSD pair. Users will also be able to exchange the stablecoins without fees during the promotional period.  The action followed Binance minting some $1 billion TUSD on the Tron network last week, blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence shows.  The development comes at a turbulent period for the world’s largest crypto exchange as it faces lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny in multiple countries. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, its CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, and Binance.US for violating federal securities laws.  French authorities are investigating the company for “aggravated money laundering."" The exchange will also quit the Netherlands after failing to obtain a license and also applied to cancel permissions to operate in the U.K. and to end its registration with Cyprus' securities regulator.  The maneuver also signals Binance’s intention to propagate TUSD trading on its platform. The token is the fifth-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin on the market, and it’s issued by crypto firm ArchBlock, previously known as TrustToken. In 2020, a little-known Asian conglomerate Techteryx acquired the intellectual property of the token from TrustToken.  Reports allege that crypto billionaire and Tron founder Justin Sun might be behind TUSD, but the issuer denied allegations.  Binance started to promote TUSD on its platform after New York state regulator’s forced issuer Paxos to mint Binance-branded stablecoin BUSD in February. Now, the exchange’s crypto wallets hold at least 90% of the stablecoin’s $3.1 billion total market capitalization, according to Arkham data.",NEUTRAL,TUSD,EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB | TUSD | ARKM,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/binance-will-expand-zero-fee-trading-on-trueusd-after-minting-1b-of-tusd,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8244fca4b937a852cad5d05e65743bbac57beae4-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Flash loans can make arbitrage trading strategies equally accessible to everyone, regardless of their wealth or credit score. This is just one of many examples of how DeFi has the potential to grow rapidly and upend traditional finance. Thesis Flash loans use Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) smart contracts to enable anonymous lending with no collateral or liability. Flash loans are one of the most compelling examples so far of how the Ethereum decentralized finance (DeFi) system can live up to its promise of creating a fairer financial system. As DeFi matures, its advantages over traditional finance will compound, possibly leading to mass adoption of the Ethereum network and higher Ethereum prices. Flash Loans An interesting story made its way around the internet recently: a crypto trading bot borrowed $200 million for an arbitrage trade that netted it a mere $3 in profit. The bot noticed that Threshold (T-USD) was priced differently on the Curve and Balancer exchanges and profited off of that difference. Your first instinct might be to laugh at what sounds like a buggy bot taking an incredibly large and risky loan for a tiny profit, or to wonder who was crazy enough to lend a crypto trader $200 million in the first place. But with an understanding of smart contracts and flash loans, we'll see that this loan actually wasn't that risky for any party involved. In the future, such a loan may be commonplace rather than a news headline. A smart contract is a computer program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike a typical program, which is controlled and executed by one person or machine, a smart contract is executed based on the consensus of a decentralized network that anyone who owns staked Ethereum participates in. In exchange for ensuring that smart contracts and other transactions execute as intended based on cryptographic proofs, network participants earn transaction fees. A flash loan is an Ethereum smart contract that executes a group of transactions which logically ensure the lender is repaid no matter what the borrower does with the money. The first transaction in the group is the lender sending money to the borrower, and the last transaction is always the borrower returning the money (plus interest) to the lender. In addition to those transactions, the borrower can perform any other transactions they want within the Ethereum network. If the borrower attempts a transaction that would cause them to be unable to pay the lender back (for example, taking the wrong side of an arbitrage trade), then the transaction where they pay the lender back will fail due to lack of funds. The brilliant thing about a flash loan contract is that if any transaction in the group fails, then all transactions in the group fail, including the transaction where the lender sends the money in the first place. To make an analogy, this is as if the borrower gave the lender a cancel button. If the lender realizes they won't be paid back, they can simply hit the cancel button and negate all of the borrower's actions to get their principal back. Because all transactions within a smart contract are finalized at the same time, cancellation is guaranteed to work even if some transactions involve parties besides the borrower and lender. That's why flash loans don't require collateral or credit checks; the ""cancel button"" eliminates the risk of the lender losing the principal. It's Too Good To Be True Savvy readers might wonder how this isn't an infinite money glitch. Why not loan yourself money and be guaranteed to get it back when you do something stupid? There's a simple answer: transaction fees must be paid whether a transaction succeeds or fails. If someone uses a smart contract that performs transactions which lose money, they can choose not to finalize those transactions and retain the initial money (whether it's theirs or a lender's), but they still have to pay transaction fees. Because the borrower is assuming the ""risk"" of paying transaction fees, it only makes sense for them to take a flash loan if they're confident that it will be profitable. Due in part to these fees, as well as the time-sensitive nature of lending and arbitrage, a flash loan typically must complete in a matter of seconds, or in technical terms within one ""block"" on the blockchain. As stated previously, another restriction is that a flash loan can only involve transactions on the Ethereum network. This prevents a borrower from converting the loan to USD, for example, where the logical guarantees of smart contracts can't be enforced. Use Cases The use cases for flash loans are currently limited, considering that the loaned money can't be taken outside the Ethereum network. The primary use case is for arbitrage. Because arbitrage strategies exploit tiny pricing differences, in traditional finance, they've historically only made a lot of money for people who started out with a lot of money in the first place (or people who had the collateral to take out a loan for a lot of money). But with DeFi, it doesn't matter how much money you have, what your credit score is, or where you live. Anybody who finds an arbitrage opportunity can take out an uncollateralized $200 million flash loan and use it to make the same amount (less interest) as somebody who already has $200 million. Although interest is an important consideration, crypto exchanges can have short-term pricing differences as high as 1-5% , compared to flash loan interest rates of 0.09% . In practice, this means a $1 million arbitrage trade netting 1% ($10,000) profit would still net 0.91% ($9,100) for somebody with $0 to their name who took out a flash loan for the entire $1 million. In traditional finance, they would be unable to do the trade and make $0. Thus, DeFi is almost always better for the borrower than traditional finance, although in both systems properly verifying and sizing the trade becomes more important when taking a loan. This key point is worth repeating: in traditional finance, your profit opportunity from an arbitrage trade directly depends on how much money you have. But in DeFi, arbitrage strategies present equal profit opportunity (less interest) to everyone, regardless of how much money they have. This is because flash loans make huge loans instantly available to any anonymous entity that knows how to profit from them. Aside from being more equitable, flash loans can also create more efficient markets because it increases the number of potential arbitrageurs. Although having pricing differences of 1-5% across exchanges and liquidity pools sounds inefficient, some pricing differences are actually intended due to a design known as an automated market maker , which relies on arbitrageurs to create price parity while maintaining decentralization. While the use cases for flash loans may be somewhat limited today, imagine a future where all stocks, currencies, and other assets trade on a decentralized blockchain like Ethereum. The amount of arbitrage opportunities and overall uses for flash loans would dramatically expand. This imaginary market would certainly be more efficient and equitable than traditional finance markets today. Disruption One might wonder whether traditional finance could implement smart contracts and flash loans to avoid being disrupted. In short, it can't. Even if every exchange, bank, and sketchy startup in the traditional finance world agreed to share a single smart contract protocol, each of them would still be responsible for executing their transactions within a contract. This means that a single entity acting in bad faith or in error could steal/lose funds. Considering that, it would be difficult to find someone in traditional finance willing to lend $200 million with no collateral. For comparison, smart contracts on Ethereum are executed by independent validators using a proof of stake consensus mechanism. This means it would take over half of the entire validator network acting in bad faith or in error for a contract to not execute as written. This is unlikely enough that anonymous $200 million loans are a somewhat regular occurrence on Ethereum. It's also worth noting that arbitrage is currently very profitable for many large players in traditional finance. It's estimated that the S&P 500 presents $3 billion in theoretical profit opportunity from latency arbitrage per year. Market maker Citadel begrudgingly provided real data to support this estimate, paying $5.2 million in alleged ill-gotten gains to settle a lawsuit claiming they misled clients with strategies like latency arbitrage. When large firms are profiting millions of dollars from arbitrage every year, it's understandable that they wouldn't go out of their way to make it more accessible to everyone. While I think it's unlikely that traditional finance can win out over DeFi, it is possible that other DeFi protocols besides Ethereum ultimately capture a large share of the DeFi industry. I view competition from other blockchains and restrictive regulations as the biggest risks to Ethereum. But for the moment, Ethereum is the DeFi industry leader and staked Ethereum is my top DeFi investment. Conclusion Ethereum flash loans are a great example of how DeFi can be more efficient, equitable, and reliable than traditional finance. We've only scratched the surface of Ethereum DeFi's potential. Increasing usage of flash loans and other DeFi products is bullish for Ethereum because increased network usage can lead to a higher staking yield and ultimately more demand for Ethereum itself.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612628-ethereum-flash-loans-how-equitable-defi-tech-can-upend-traditional-finance?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14049210.jpeg

Oracle Daemon developers will build and develop several user tools. The collaboration aims to enhance the user experience and data quality on the network. Flare Network, a highly scalable Layer 1 blockchain providing high-integrity data to developers, has announced a strategic collaboration with Oracle Daemon, a group of talented developers working on blockchain and Web 3 solutions. The Oracle Daemon developers have previously been original data providers for the Flare Time Series Oracle on both the Flare and Songbird networks. Announced Monday, the collaboration aims at developing a new suite of user tools that enhance the user experience, provide better quality data, and introduce new features on Flare’s network. Speaking on the latest collaboration with Oracle Daemon, David Pangerl, CEO & Founder of Oracle Daemon, said: “We have been building on Flare from the start, and with this collaboration, we will develop a number of important new tools to benefit the growing network.” The developer group will build out three main user tools, namely the multi-wallet management tool, advanced data provider analytics tools and the auto-claiming executors. The multi-wallet management tool aims to streamline users' accounts and provide a detailed overview of all their balances in multiple wallets. The tool will allow users to manage funds in multiple wallets and accounts, offering simplified access to monitor and control their wallets. The advanced data provider analytics tool is the crop of the three features set to be added to the Flare network. Oracle Daemon will develop a detailed analytics tool specifically tailored to data providers. By leveraging the tool, data providers can gain valuable insights into their performance metrics, including data quality, reliability, and usage. As a data oracle, Flare aims to provide the highest quality of trustless data, and this tool will help data providers achieve this. “I’m most excited about the advanced data provider analytics,” Pangerl said on developing the advanced data providers analytics tool. “Flare is the only blockchain focused on giving developers access to quality data at scale. So, whatever we can do to support and optimise the data provision process will benefit the whole network.” Finally, the collaboration will see the addition of auto-claiming executors, which will automate all existing token-claiming processes. These executors help users collect rewards and later on disburse the rewards to the user. With multiple rewards up for grabs, manual token claiming can be some work for the user. The auto-claiming executor will encompass several rewards, including data provider rewards, validator rewards, FlareDrops, FTSO delegation rewards, and escrowed fund unlocks.

The round was led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and included Pantera Capital, Binance Labs, Coinbase Ventures and Apollo Crypto, according to an emailed statement on Wednesday.  Maverick plans to use its new capital to build more efficient liquid staking token infrastructure and solve cross-chain liquidity efficiencies, the statement said.  Liquid staking protocols have become increasingly popular among digital assets investors and analysts expects further growth for the sector following Ethereum's Shanghai upgrade.  Maverick's aim is to provide the infrastructure to bring greater efficiency to decentralized finance (DeFi) markets, according to the release. The protocol currently has more than $30 million in total value locked (TVL) to date, according to DeFiLlama.  In March, it unveiled its decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, powered by a smart contract-based automated market maker (AMM), which allows investors to capture greater revenue through automating the ranges in which they put their tokens to work. Since then, Maverick has also integrated with liquid staking projects such as Lido, Frax, Liquity, cbETH, Rocket Pool, and Swell, the statement said.  Decentralized trading platforms could become a preferred avenue for traders amid ongoing concerns about the stability of centralized exchanges, most acutely highlighted by FTX's collapse last year along with recent reminders in the U.S. regulatory backlash against the likes of Coinbase and Binance.

However, this has quickly changed with US investors taking advantage of the low prices presented last week when BTC fell below the $25,000 resistance. Related Reading: Bullish Signal: Bitcoin Realized Profit And Loss Fall To October 2020 Levels A report from Kaiko shows that US investor BTC trading volume has risen sharply compared to its January figures to 44% in June. This shift in Bitcoin trading volume suggests that investors are moving back toward BTC and leaving altcoins behind once more. BTC volume on US exchanges rise to 44% | Source: Kaiko This explains the fact that while Bitcoin has been on an impressive rally, altcoins have not seen as much upside. Thus, it is safe to say that most of this rally will likely be focused on BTC, indicating the potential for further upside from here. A move toward BTC compared to altcoins also shows a lower risk appetite among crypto investors. This is because while altcoins provide an opportunity for higher gains, it also comes with a higher risk of losses Hence, making Bitcoin the choice for investors when getting back into the market from a bear, but not wanting to take too many risks. BTC Steadies Above $28,000 Bitcoin bulls have now set their sights on the $30,000 price level after adding $2,000 to the digital asset’s value in the last 48 hours. This recovery signals what could possibly be the start of another 100% run similar to the one that was witnessed in the first quarter of 2023. BTC reclaims $28,000 support | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com If this happens, then $40,000 is a conservative stop point for the BTC price. The question then remains if this rally will rub off on altcoins which are still struggling, especially since the majority of the new volume is currently focused on Bitcoin.

At the time of writing, BTC has broken above $28,900, displaying 8.23% gains in the last 24 hours. The cryptocurrency is performing even better on the 7-day chart after rising 11.34% and bringing its total market cap back above $561 billion.

42410329,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gdJhWd,1687352400,Bitcoin Miner CleanSpark to Buy 2 Georgia Facilities for $9.3M,"Nasdaq-listed bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark (CLSK) has agreed to acquire two facilities in Dalton, Georgia for $9.3 million in cash.  The facilities will host over 6,000 Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs and S19J Pro+s and are expected to add just under 1 exahash per second (EH/s) to CleanSpark's hashrate, according to an emailed announcement on Wednesday.  CleanSpark's aim is to have 16 EH/s of power by the end of 2023, which the acquisition of these facilities will ""ensure [they] have more than enough infrastructure to reach,"" CEO Zach Bradford said.  Its previous big move was the purchase of 45,000 new Bitmain Antminer S19 XPs for $144.9 million in April.  ""We continue to make use of opportunities created by current market conditions to prepare for next year’s bitcoin halving,” said CFO Gary A. Vecchiarelli.  With the industry still reeling from the sharp fall in bitcoin's valuation last year combined with rising costs from high electricity prices, mining firms are looking toward bitcoin's next halving, now less than a year away, which will reduce rewards for mining blocks, and challenge their profit margins even more.

14048680,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/wisdomtree-and-invesco-file-bitcoin-etf-applications,1687352400,WisdomTree and Invesco File Bitcoin ETF Applications,"Global investment firm BlackRock's recent filing for a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has reignited optimism in the industry and spurred a flurry of similar filings. Less than a week after BlackRock's application, renowned investment firms WisdomTree and Invesco have followed suit, filing applications for their respective spot Bitcoin ETFs. WisdomTree's Persistence in Spot Bitcoin ETF Filing New York-based WisdomTree lodged its latest filing for a spot Bitcoin ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 21. If approved, the ""WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust"" would be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange under the ticker ""BTCW."" Notably, this is WisdomTree's third attempt to secure approval for a spot Bitcoin ETF. Previous applications submitted in December 2021 and October 2022 were rejected due to the SEC's concerns about fraud and market manipulation. In their recent filing, WisdomTree, which oversees approximately $83 billion in assets, has expressed willingness to enter into a ""surveillance sharing agreement"" with a U.S.-based spot trading platform for Bitcoin. This step echoes BlackRock's approach in its recent filing, aiming to mitigate the SEC's concerns by establishing robust surveillance mechanisms to detect and prevent price distortions and manipulation. Invesco Reactivates Its Application for a Spot Bitcoin ETF Shortly after WisdomTree's application, Invesco, a global investment manager, reactivated its application for a similar spot Bitcoin ETF product. The proposed ""Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF"" aims to be listed on the Cboe BZX exchange, per the 19b-4 document informing the SEC of the proposed rule change. Invesco's filing emphasizes the benefit of professional custodians and other service providers. This setup, they argue, reduces reliance on ""loosely regulated offshore vehicles"" and ensures better protection for investors' principal investments in Bitcoin. Impact of BlackRock's Strong ETF Approval Track Record Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas responded to the flurry of filings, attributing the renewed activity to BlackRock's entry into the race. Balchunas highlighted BlackRock's impressive track record, with a 575-1 success rate of ETF approvals by the SEC, adding weight to the firm's application. Speculations About Fidelity Investments' Entry Amid this resurgence of interest in Bitcoin ETFs, there are rumors that Fidelity Investments, a multi-trillion-dollar fund manager, might also join the fray. Speculation is rife that Fidelity, which manages roughly $4.9 trillion in assets, could file for its own spot Bitcoin ETF or possibly make an offer on Grayscale's GBTC ETF product. While the SEC has yet to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, the recent wave of applications, driven by industry giant BlackRock's filing, has renewed hope and sparked a fresh round of interest in this segment of the crypto market.

42420190,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa5T3,1687352400,Crypto Exchange BIT Unveils Options Market for Cardano's ADA Token,"Cryptocurrency derivatives exchange BIT on Wednesday rolled out options tied to Cardano's ADA token while promising to add more alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) in coming months.  The ADA options are live in the platform today and are denominated and settled in U.S. dollars, BIT said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. One ADA options contract represents 1 ADA, the exchange's spokesperson said.  ADA, the native token of Ethereum competitor Cardano, has a market value of $9.73 billion and is the world's eighth-largest cryptocurrency at press time. Alternative cryptocurrencies tend to be more volatile than the market leaders, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH).  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy the asset, while a put option gives the right to sell.  The availability of ADA options means traders can now use the options to hedge their portfolio risks or bet on a volatility explosion, as they have been doing with bitcoin and ether options.  With BIT's unified margin system, traders can use their coin holding as collateral to trade ADA options at a discount.  ""BIT's unified margin system allows users to utilize all assets in their accounts as trading collateral with a haircut ratio. ADA's haircut ratio is now 15%, meaning users can use their ADA as collateral and trade options at a 15% discount,"" BIT said in the release.  The offering, launched in collaboration with strategic partner Darley Technologies and market maker DWF Labs, expands BIT's existing suite of options, which include those tied to the decentralized layer 1 blockchain, The Open Network's TON coin and bitcoin and ether futures and options.  BIT said it plans to offer options to other altcoins, including meme coins, in the future.  The global crypto options market, led by Panama-based Deribit exchange, is already worth billions of dollars, with most of the activity concentrated in bitcoin and ether contracts, and is known to influence the spot prices of the top cryptocurrencies.",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC,ADA | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/crypto-exchange-bit-unveils-options-market-for-cardanos-ada-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53dfac72c352a5df2be434ed55c5b1fa33a2b208-4096x2106.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420196,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa5aH,1687350250,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Rallies as TradFi Players Jump Into Crypto,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, rallied over the past 24 hours after various traditional finance firms announced moves into the crypto market, indicating bullish sentiment. Bitcoin jumped 8% on the day, pushing it to $28,800, after trading flat for the last few days at around $26,800. Altcoins also surged, with bitcoin cash (BCH) rallying over 20% in the same time period. Banking giant Deutsche Bank announced Tuesday that it had applied for a digital asset custody license in Germany and crypto exchange EDX Markets (which is backed by the likes of Citadel Securities and Fidelity,) started offering trading for BTC, ether (ETH), litecoin and bitcoin cash. Just last week, BlackRock filed for a spot BTC exchange-traded fund (ETF) too. “This move towards crypto by major financial institutions reflects a significant shift in their stance on the industry's potential, especially given the timing,” Mark L. Newton, head of technical strategy at FundStrat, said in a note.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s (GBTC) share price continued to soar on Tuesday on optimism about converting the fund into an ETF after BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF. The shares rose past $16 on secondary markets for the first time since May 10, according to TradingView data, and have gained some 24% since Thursday, the day of BlackRock's filing. The discount on GBTC’s share price relative to net asset value narrowed to as little as 33% Tuesday morning, according to CoinDesk’s calculation. This is the lowest level since last September, and lower than the 34% it recorded in early March.  Investment management company Invesco, which has $1.4 trillion assets under management, reapplied for a spot bitcoin ETF. In 2021, Invesco first filed for a bitcoin ETF in conjunction with Galaxy Digital. It also filed for a bitcoin futures ETF, but dropped the effort in October 2021 after a futures ETF by ProShares was approved and began trading first. In its filing, Invesco argued that the lack of a spot bitcoin ETF pushes investors toward riskier alternatives, as seen in insolvencies like FTX, Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager Digital Holdings. Invesco also emphasized the need for investor protection, saying that approval for such a spot bitcoin ETF hinges on a surveillance sharing agreement with a significant, regulated market, not on the regulation of the spot bitcoin market itself.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows annualized rolling three-month basis in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and offshore exchanges since January. Basis refers to the spread between prices in futures and spot markets.  The CME basis or premium has jumped to a yearly high of 12%, indicating a bullish action on the global derivatives giant.  Basis on offshore exchanges lags at 5.88%.

14047076,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538938,1687348859,Nansen Forecast For Bitcoin Bull Run: Regulatory Clarity And Lower Inflation,"The dynamics of the crypto market never cease to enthrall, with bullish rallies and bearish downturns coloring the landscape. Yet, deciphering the key factors to ignite the next Bitcoin (BTC) bull run is no easy task. However, Nansen, a leading cryptocurrency analytics firm, recently voiced its perspective on this subject. In a report published on June 20, the firm puts forth two fundamental prerequisites for the next surge in Bitcoin’s value. It insists on the importance of clear United States regulations around cryptocurrency, and a demonstration that core inflation is on a downward trajectory. Regulatory Clarity And Inflation: Catalysts For The Next Bull Run? According to Nansen, US regulatory clarity could be a significant determining factor in the next bull cycle. This perspective comes amid the ongoing regulatory tensions with major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price On Shaky Ground: Market Analysts Warn Of Potential Fall To $20,000 Level Despite the uncertainties, Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has held not so badly, showing a commendable rise of more than 10% over the past week. Additionally, Nansen’s research points to the vital role of inflation. According to the crypto analytics firm, the potential for a recession appears to be receding, while persistent inflation continues to surprise. While this situation is leading to complex impacts, with non-Asian monetary policies staying tighter for extended periods, this scenario also poses increased challenges for risk assets. Nansen reported: The scenario of a recession is being pushed back, and inflation is surprising by its ‘stubbornness.’ This creates non-linear effects, whereby monetary policy (outside of Asia) remains more restrictive for longer and in turn becomes an increasing headwind for risk assets. Bitcoin Price Action: Strength Amid Uncertainty Despite these economic and regulatory headwinds, Bitcoin’s price has exhibited resilience. At the time of the writing, BTC traded at $28,925, a more than 11% increase from its previous plummeted price below $25,000 in the past few weeks. Notably, over the past 7 days, Bitcoin’s total market capitalization experienced a boost of 11.6%, amounting to an additional $50 billion. The market capitalization of Bitcoin presently hovers at $561 billion, an increase from last Wednesday’s $503 billion. Bitcoin’s daily trading volume has also surged from a low of around $7 billion last week to as high as above $20 billion in the past 24 hours. Furthermore, there’s been a decrease in crypto-implied volatility, suggesting that much of the regulatory and macroeconomic bad news might already be factored into Bitcoin’s price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Dominance Touches Two-Year Peak, Here’s Why According to Nansen, shallow sell-offs indicate that the market is absorbing the selling pressure well, which is a positive sign for the overall market strength.

42420211,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa5V7,1687348800,Crypto Robo-Adviser Hedgehog Launches as App With Gemini as Custodian,"Hedgehog, a robo-adviser that provides automated financial guidance for cryptocurrency investors, has launched as an app on both the iOS and Android systems, the company said Wednesday.

14047146,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/cardano-ada-updates-system-to-node-8-1-1,1687348800,Cardano $ADA Updates System To Node 8.1.1,"Cardano, a leading proof-of-stake blockchain platform, has launched an important update to its network, Node 8.1.1. This update builds upon the foundational aspects of its predecessor, Node 8.0.0, and introduces several technical enhancements to the Cardano ecosystem, in particular for the ouroboros-network used for P2P topologies that don't yet contain DNS names. One of the major improvements brought by Node 8.1.1 is the enhancement of node performance at epoch boundaries. In Cardano's blockchain system, an epoch refers to a reward cycle lasting approximately 432,000 slots, or around five days. During these epochs, ADA tokens are staked, and new blocks are produced on the network. By optimizing the performance at these boundaries, the new update ensures a smoother transition between epochs and a more efficient rewards cycle. Technical Improvements and Innovations The Node 8.1.1 update also addresses issues related to peer-to-peer network communications and the Cardano-based domain name system (DNS). These improvements help boost the network's overall performance and security, reducing potential bottlenecks and enhancing the pllatform's scalability. The new node no longer incorporates wallet or explorer functionalities. These are now managed by separate backend components that communicate with the node via local Inter-process communication (IPC), streamlining operations and making the system more efficient to avoid issues that have, in the past, damaged the Cardano blockchain. Regulatory Challenges and Cardano's Unwavering Commitment Despite ongoing regulatory scrutiny, especially from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Cardano remains dedicated to its growth and development goals. The successful launch of Node 8.1.1, amidst this regulatory pressure, speaks volumes about Cardano's commitment to continually enhance its network performance and stay at the forefront of blockchain technology. Cardano's decision to release updates and improvements, irrespective of external pressures, underlines its resilience and its firm focus on offering a robust, efficient, and secure blockchain platform to its users. Ecosystem Growth and Market Performance Analysis The launch of Node 8.1.1 brings tangible improvements to Cardano's network, which could potentially have a positive impact on Cardano's DeFi ecosystem. While ADA's market price did not immediately reflect these advancements, certain market indicators suggest a potential bullish trend in the future. Despite a more than 8% decrease in ADA's price over the past week, indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), MVRV Ratio, and high whale activity hint at a possible bullish trend reversal. Notably, ADA's Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a possibility of a bullish crossover, suggesting that a northward price movement might be on the horizon. Despite the immediate lack of positive impact on ADA's price, the technical advancements brought by Node 8.1.1 and the steady ecosystem growth indicate Cardano's potential for strong performance in the future. This combination of continuous network improvements and strong market indicators underscores Cardano's resilience and growth potential in the ever-evolving world of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

14045863,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538919,1687345844,Why Are Bitcoin And Crypto Up Today? You Need To Know This,"Bitcoin investors are currently experiencing a déjà vu. As has happened several times in the past, the recent Tether FUD has once again marked the local bottom for the BTC price. At the same time, euphoria and greed have returned to the market. And there are several good reasons for this. BlackRock has applied for a spot ETF and has an insane track record, Fidelity, Citadel & Schwab are launching a crypto exchange, Invesco and WisdomTree have both renewed their Bitcoin ETF applications and Germany’s largest asset manager Deutsche Bank has applied for a crypto custody license. Big money is definitely making its way into the crypto market after the hard crackdown aka Operation Choke Point 2.0 in the US to grab the largest piece of the pie possible. What Triggered The Bitcoin And Crypto Price Spike? One of the driving factors behind the price rise in the crypto market is undoubtedly the bullish news surrounding Bitcoin and the potential wave of new institutional investors. Bitcoin is once again setting the trend for the broader crypto market, which can also be seen in the fact that Bitcoin dominance, the share of BTC’s market capitalization in the entire crypto market, continues to rise. The metric rose to its highest level since mid-April 2021 today and currently stands at 51.08%. Yet, the Bitcoin rally has also breathed new life into several altcoins. Among others, FLOW, CFX and BCH are up 22% in the last 24 hours, followed by STX with 18%, OP with 17% and INJ with 15%. ETH is up 4.8%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hits $138,000 On Binance US, What Happened? However, it is important to note that the current price rally is not mainly due to speculation by futures traders. As we reported yesterday, in recent weeks BTC whales with assets of 1,000 to 10,000 BTC have accumulated a total of 131,6000 BTC worth around $3.5 billion from the spot market. And this trend continues. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young-Ju wrote via Twitter: This is not a short squeeze, but someone(s) is just buying $BTC a lot. I repeat. This is not a short squeeze, but someone(s) is just buying $BTC a lot. The analyst is referring to the hourly short squeeze ratio indicator. As the chart below shows, the metric has remained relatively flat compared to previous price spikes, indicating that there is more upside potential if short positions are squeezed (once again). This also implies that the spot market had a major influence on the movement. In general, the rise can therefore be seen as more sustainable. Nevertheless, it should be noted that there was a certain degree of short squeeze. Coinglass data shows that about $44 millions in shorts were liquidated. The level is similar to that seen on May 28 this year, when $44 million in BTC shorts were liquidated and the Bitcoin price rose by 4.4%. Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at K33 Research, also made another bullish observation regarding the CME futures. “Very bullish action on the CME,” says Lunde, who explained that CME’s basis pushed to yearly highs after seeing the largest relative daily growth in OI since November 9, 2022. “Allocations to the futures ETFs did not cause the growth, as the active market participation share increased from 42% to 51% yesterday,” remarked the analyst.

14045623,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612729-cleanspark-a-fundamentals-perspective?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1687345240,CleanSpark: A Fundamentals Perspective,"Summary CleanSpark reported mining 609 Bitcoins in May 2023, with revenues growing by 14.2% in Q2 of fiscal 2023. The company is expanding its facilities and mining machines, aiming to double its hash rate by the end of the calendar year. Despite growth potential, CleanSpark has not yet demonstrated consistent profitability over consecutive quarters. CleanSpark (CLSK), a small-cap cryptocurrency miner, began life in 2014 as an advanced energy technology company, converting organic matter into synthesis gas. After acquiring ATL Data Centers in 2020, it refocused itself on Bitcoin data mining. The firm continues to expand with new facilities and Bitcoin mining machines. In its May 2023 Update, it reported mining 609 Bitcoins, valued at approximately $27,400 each. CleanSpark sold 471 of them that month and received $12.9 million in proceeds. Also according to the Update, it ranked 44 th on the Financial Times’ 2022 list of the 500 Fastest Growing Companies in the Americas. In addition, it ranked 13 th on Deloitte’s Fast 500. Revenue, EBITDA, and earnings In the second quarter of fiscal 2023 (January through March), CleanSpark’s revenue grew by 14.2%, from $37.2 million to $42.5 million. That continued a trend that began when it switched to Bitcoin mining: CLSK Revenue chart (SeekingAlpha) There are two aspects to its revenue. One is the number of coins produced by day, month or quarter. The second is the value of each coin, which depends on external markets. No individual company has much, if any influence, over the cryptomarkets, just as few firms have much influence over stock markets. Still, as CFO Gary A. Vecchiarelli commented in the Q2 earnings release, ""The rebound in Bitcoin prices translated to greater gross profit margins and cash flow in the second quarter."" However, companies in the industry do have numerous opportunities to increase their output. Or, more importantly, increase their output in relation to the investments they make. CleanSpark’s 10-K for 2022 identified the most important of those factors, “Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining.” Fast growth is a necessity as the company prepares for a semi-scheduled halving of Bitcoin prices, probably in the first half of next year. In April or May, miners will be awarded 3.125 bitcoins for every block they successfully mine. Currently, they receive 6.25. To offset the halving, a company will need to double its production. Speaking during the second-quarter earnings conference call, CEO Zach Bradford sounded optimistic: “We are in a rapid growth phase and we'll continue there for the next few quarters. For perspective, we expect to more than double our hash rate by reaching our guidance at the end-of-the calendar year. That is extraordinary growth. As I said earlier in the call, we have secured about 99% of the machines we need to reach our targets and the infrastructure that will house those machines is advancing at pace.” One more aspect of revenue reporting deserves attention. The company does not necessarily sell all the Bitcoins it mines. At the end of the second quarter, it held $10.3 in cash plus 196 Bitcoin, giving it total liquidity of roughly $15 million. Turning to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA fell in the second quarter, and, unfortunately, also continued a trend in the wrong direction: CLSK EBITDA chart (SeekingAlpha) It’s much the same story for earnings per share, diluted, before extraordinary items: CLSK Chart of EPS (SeekingAlpha) For the second quarter, basic EPS and diluted EPS were negative, at -$0.23, compared to break-even for the same quarter last year. CFO Gary Vecchiarelli explained in the conference call, “our GAAP loss for the second quarter was $18.5 million compared to a slight loss in the same quarter of last year. The majority of this difference was due to increased depreciation and amortization of approximately $11 million, driven by our significant purchase and deployment of top of the line Bitmain ASICs, as well as the assets acquired in the Washington and Sandersville transactions.” Normalized basic EPS and normalized diluted EPS were negative as well: -$0.14. A year earlier, they were positive, at $0.03. Expenses and other considerations One tried-and-true method of generating positive EPS is by minimizing costs. That brings us to some items found in CleanSpark’s Q2-fiscal 2023 and 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022. First, the company has a net loss from discontinued operations (energy technology). For the second quarter, that amounted to $294,000, well down from the $2,203,000 million loss in Q2-2022. For the year ended September 30, 2022, its loss was $17,236,961. Second, CleanSpark provided stock-based compensation, a non-cash expense, of $11.620 million for the second quarter. Extrapolated out over four quarters, that would suggest annual compensation of more than $45 million. In fiscal 2022, the figure was $31.465 million. That seems like more than adequate compensation for a company that is losing money, especially one that had total revenue of $131.5 million in fiscal 2022. Third, CleanSpark paid out $3.339 million in legal fees in the first quarter, which the company says was due to a litigation settlement and transaction matters. Some of that may be attributable to the wind-down of its energy business. Otherwise, it, too, seems more than one would expect for a company of this size. Fourth, there is the matter of stock issuances and dilution. At the end of Q2 fiscal 2023, the company’s weighted average common shares count was 80.460 million, nearly double the 41.390 million outstanding at the end of Q2 fiscal 2023. For shareholders, those issuances, including some for executive compensation, nearly cut the value of CleanSpark shares in half. That’s a material haircut for investors still waiting for a black bottom line. On the positive side, expansion has required little debt. Valuation The SeekingAlpha system gives the firm an A rating for valuation, which, in my opinion, is a bit high. First, two important valuation metrics are not available because the company operates at a loss: the P/E and PEG ratios. Second, I noted that revenue went up as CleanSpark moved from the energy business to Bitcoin mining. But the share price has been flowing in the opposite direction: CLSK Price Chart (SeekingAlpha) I know the firm has much promise, not least because it is aggressively expanding its footprint. Still, we haven’t yet seen the company give us a couple of consecutive quarters of profitability. I don’t expect the share price to head upward until it does. Third, this is cryptocurrency country, where the volatility of Bitcoin is very high. What if the next halving is not the only factor driving down prices next year? Other perspectives SeekingAlpha analysts give CleanSpark a Buy rating, with a score of 4.00. Wall Street analysts and the Quants give the firm a Strong Buy rating, with scores of 4.75 and 4.62, respectively. The professionals who manage institutional funds own a reasonable 43.77% of the shares outstanding, and in the past quarter, 59 holders increased their positions, 39 reduced them, and 14 held. Conclusion Given the company’s growth potential, I might have given it a Strong Buy; however, I have a number of reservations, as outlined above. In particular, its fundamentals are those of a company that has not proven its ability to consistently generate profits over several consecutive quarters (and years).",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612729-cleanspark-a-fundamentals-perspective?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14045623.jpeg
14045513,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/bitcoin-breakout-catches-investors-by-surprise,1687345139,Bitcoin breakout catches investors by surprise,"After two months of slow sideways and downward price movement, bitcoin has suddenly broken the trend, giving control back to the bulls. Many investors had fled Following on from the mass of negativity caused by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s attack on the crypto industry culminating in suing the two biggest crypto exchanges, Binance and Coinbase, most investors had fled the scene, possibly thinking that crypto might die. As mentioned in a Crypto Daily article published only two days previously, it is times like these that the intelligent and experienced traders are waiting for. In addition, the technicals were looking quite positive. Technicals looking good Bitcoin had been traversing in a downward sloping channel since mid-April (a bullish pattern in itself), which could even be taken as a bull flag that had gone on for rather a long time. Had bitcoin fallen out of the bottom of the channel instead, then this would have been seen as extremely bearish. However, bitcoin did the most logical thing and broke out strongly to the upside. It is currently playing with $29,000, which it did hit earlier today. There is the possibility that the price could storm on to the major resistance at $30,300, but it could be expected to get rejected here, at least for the time being. Can the move be sustained? It might be wondered if bitcoin will be able to sustain a sizable rally on the scale of the 4 and a half month one it made from the beginning of the year. There is still much fear and negativity permeating the crypto space, and given the SEC actions, liquidity is very thin. However, bitcoin has its halving cycle that will be drawing the king of the crypto assets higher. This is due to take place in April 2024, so still a lot of ups and downs before the bull run can start in earnest. Nothing comes close All does appear to be on track though.

The so-called trendline breakout has now opened doors for the cryptocurrency to head toward $30,400, according to FxPro's senior market analyst Alex Kuptsikevich.  ""In terms of technical analysis, this is an important bullish signal as the price closed above its 50-day moving average and above previous local highs in a sharp move on Tuesday. The move confirms the breakdown of the downtrend that has been in place for the past two months,"" Kuptsikevich said in an email.  ""The next target for the bulls is the area between the April and May highs at $29,400-$30,400,"" Kuptsikevich added.  The market mood has flipped bullish this week due to a flurry of spot bitcoin ETF applications by BlackRock (BLK), WisdomTree and Invesco (IVZ).  The falling trendline breakout in the daily chart indicates that the pullback from the April 14 high of $31,000 has run its course and the broader bullish trend has resumed.  Note the pullback ran out of steam near $25,200 – the former resistance flipped into support during the U.S. banking crisis of March.  The defense of $25,200 and the subsequent breakout represents a positive resolution of a technical analysis pattern called ""throwback"" and suggests scope for a rally to $37,000.

Crypto passive income refers to the ability to earn money from your cryptocurrency investments without actively trading or constantly monitoring the market. It is highly regarded because it provides opportunities for diversification, potentially high returns on investment, and accessibility to individuals of all backgrounds. In this article, we will delve into the world of three high-potential coins: Ethereum (ETH), TENET (TENET), and the trailblazing Caged Beasts (BEASTS). Each of these cryptocurrencies offers unique opportunities for generating passive income and shaking up the crypto landscape. Ethereum - Liquid Staking With The Alt King!Ethereum (ETH), the king of smart contract platforms, needs no introduction. It has revolutionized the crypto space, allowing developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) and launch their own tokens with ease. Compared to other crypto projects, Ethereum boasts unique strengths such as a robust ecosystem, widespread adoption, and the ability to execute complex smart contracts efficiently. But what about liquid staking on Ethereum? Liquid staking combines the benefits of staking and liquidity, allowing users to stake their Ethereum while still having the flexibility to trade or use their staked assets. By utilizing platforms like Lido, users can seamlessly stake and unstake their ETH, earning lucrative yields while enjoying the freedom to access their assets at any time. This innovative approach to staking offers the best of both worlds and is a game-changer for passive income seekers. TENET - The LSD-Driven Blockchain Now, let's dive into the world of TENET (TENET), a more recent crypto gem that has emerged. Layer-1 blockchain Tenet has partnered with omnichain messaging protocol LayerZero to plug into a cross-chain decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. This collaboration grants Tenet access to the wider DeFi landscape across multiple blockchains. TENET's DeFi-focused ecosystem provides liquidity and yield products for liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). Similar to Ethereum's liquid staking pools, such as Lido, TENET's network enables users to stake and unstake assets seamlessly, unlocking the potential for lucrative yields. Moreover, TENET allows users to create projects and tokens, integrating them with LayerZero technology for enhanced interoperability across various smart contract blockchains. By leveraging this ecosystem, TENET empowers PoS native tokens to maximize their earnings potential, showcasing the power of LSDs in the DeFi space. Caged Beasts - Defying Convention with Memetic Brilliance! This article wouldn't be complete without a meme coin, and Caged Beasts (BEASTS) steals the spotlight.

These tokens will also serve as a reserve to fund the growth of the Arpa ecosystem.  The tokens will be released incrementally, ensuring a gradual vesting process for stakers, validating nodes and other ecosystem participants.  The network is now finalizing a six-month community pool staking program, with plans to allocate 1.5 million tokens as monthly rewards. Community members can stake tokens to earn rewards and monitor the network’s performance.  Each arpa exchanged hands for 5 cents as of Wednesday morning.

With a 10% rally, SHIB managed to surpass a crucial resistance point that had been hindering its upward momentum. This achievement has sparked excitement among SHIB investors and the wider cryptocurrency community. After a period of consolidation, Shiba Inu broke through the resistance threshold at $0.000007, marking a crucial milestone for the cryptocurrency. This resistance level had been a major barrier for SHIB’s upward movement in recent weeks. However, with its recent 10% rally, Shiba Inu demonstrated its ability to overcome obstacles and regain bullish momentum. SHIB’s Positive Price Performance Shiba Inu’s rally can be attributed to its positive price performance over the past 24 hours and the last seven days. According to CoinMarketCap, SHIB’s price currently stands at $0.00000735. Within the last 24 hours, SHIB witnessed a notable 2.78% increase, contributing to its overall upward trend.

Interview with Gary Cardone, CEO of Card1Ventures, focuses on investing in companies that build infrastructure and solve problems in the digital asset industry. Cardone believes that the digital future is inevitable and why investing in solutions that serve this future multi-trillion dollar industry is a no-brainer. There are major disruptions and so much noise happening in the crypto/blockchain industry, but now the real serious players are starting to rise to the top. They are openly talking about where we stand, where the pitfalls are in the industry, in the technology, and where the strategic focus and legitimate investments in this industry need to be centered to move forward. They are actively working on tangible solutions that address industry challenges. The Institute for Innovation Development has committed to a thought leadership article series which started with our recent interview with Marshall Hayner CEO of Metallicus entitled Behind the Scenes of Blockchain and Crypto and continues with this article. Our commitment to reporting on this industry was reinforced by a recent Fortune Business Insights report that projected the global blockchain technology market to reach $469 billion in 2030 with a CAGR of 59.9% during the forecast period of 2023-2030. With such rapid blockchain industry growth projected, it is important to dig deeply to understand how to approach this still relatively nascent industry. To that end, we were thrilled to be introduced to and have a discussion with Gary Cardone CEO of Card1Ventures - a leading St. Petersburg, Florida-based venture capital firm focused on disruptive technologies. Gary has become a major thought leader on the blockchain and crypto industry and offers a very strategic investment approach to the industry.] Hortz: As a serial entrepreneur, early-stage investor, and venture capitalist, how did you come to blockchain and crypto? Cardone: I have been fortunate enough to be at the right place at the right time. Maybe it's a little luck. Maybe it's really, really good observational skills. They say in the military that “ he who has the greatest situational awareness wins the game ”. I started by being a part of a successful startup in the energy business which became a Fortune 30 company and helped transform the manner in which power and natural gas trade around the world, then moved to the payments industry. Observing all the friction in payments and the structural shift made with the advent of the internet and then the effects of COVID which fundamentally and forever changed the way consumers behave online and also stressed the payment rails. Successfully exiting those two firms, and being inquisitive, I began studying Bitcoin, read the original white paper, became fascinated, spent 700 hours really studying blockchain, and invested in a company last year called Node40 - a leading blockchain forensics, accounting and tax software solutions provider focused on complex digital investments - which brings us up to date. Hortz: Tell us about Node40 and what was behind your decision to invest in their company? Cardone: Node40 is a big data firm; a forensics fraud accounting, tax tracking, and tracing tool designed to track, trace, and financially quantify or “tell the story” of a digital asset’s journey across social security numbers. Say Bill buys a Bitcoin in 2016 and then gives it to his daughter in 2023. His daughter then puts it in a trust for her child. And in 2080, the grown-up child sells that Bitcoin and it is worth, say, half a million dollars. There is a whole tracking/tracing history that the tax man will want to know, the regulators will want to know, and the daughter will need for the audit she will undoubtedly undergo. And these are the things that were missing in the crypto industry until Node40 launched to solve those problems. Hortz: How have you and other investors been responding to recent crypto disruptions and scandals? Cardone: To illustrate, I was at the recent Bitcoin conference and it was 60% smaller than it was the prior year. There were no $10 million parties, no big yachts. Ever since Celsius, FTX, and bank collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic, and Signature Bank – by the way, the largest bank collapse in the history of the United States - the mood has changed and everybody was talking about it. Mathematically those three bank failures did more damage in three weeks than 2008 and 2009 combined. Nonetheless, I think that has drawn the attention of a lot of serious players who have been sitting on the sidelines studying this market. You know, the biggest companies in the world like BNY Mellon, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, and others. I saw a quality at that conference that I have never seen before. I saw more gray headed guys, pension funds, accounting and tax firms, billionaires investigating, further studying the market, and formulating a digital strategy. Serious players are coming to the table and are beginning to put money into the space, slowly but surely. But first comes the study, and the research, and a better understanding of this market. Hortz: What is your perspective of where we are in this industry and what compelled you to invest at this time? Cardone: I look at spaces that are emerging, somewhat developed, but early stage. I look at Bitcoin/crypto and I think we should look at it as an entire industry, rather than a product. We should look at it as a technology, not so much as a currency. The Bitcoin community has articulated this story poorly to the fiat and legacy political world. I think they tried to do too much, too quickly and that has been too polarizing to the legacy, analog world. Bitcoin and blockchain are basically a 14-year-old industry, and it is behaving like a 14-year-old. It is not unnatural what is happening. This is very, very normal that we would see excesses, hubris, waste, and blow-ups. Like any space, buyer beware, do your research, and go in slowly. I am extremely comfortable with the space. I like this. The industry getting beat up right provides a really good entry point for me if I am just buying the underlying asset, BTC. But more importantly, it allows me to invest in companies today and not have to compete with this 20-year-old Palo Alto view of build a company on zero cost of capital, then sell everything you have for free on a subscription model, distill the knowledge of the consumer, and sell that data. That has been the model for the last 20 years. In a marketplace that is undergoing stress like it is, where cost of capital is 8% or 10% , companies now need to make money and most do not know how to deploy successful strategies and tactics to do so. I only build businesses that can become EBITDA positive. The Node40 business will take three years to cash flow, but it will be a real cash flow business and very large with sustainable CAGR. I personally love the fraud and forensic space in any vertical because fraud and forensics are always needed and receive the highest multiples. It is irrelevant whether the cost of a Bitcoin is a dollar or a million dollars. You need fraud and security and forensic tools that make regulators comfortable. And it also makes large players like the Goldman Sachs of the world want to come in. They want clear regulations so they can manage their risk and to-date our politicians and regulators have not performed well. Hortz: Can you share more about your investment approach and strategy with Card1Ventures? Cardone: Card1Ventures searches for picks and shovels type companies that can do so in a risk adjusted fashion. My base thesis is that we will in my lifetime and yours have a fully digital economy. I seek out and find intelligent people with good ideas and/or technology that is already built or being built to support this digital future. The problem with the digital world is that you do not have systems that are set up to manage a digital world. For instance, if you wanted to track the lifespan of a digital coin (or piece of digital art) moving between you and I, that is a vastly different method of accounting and tracking than you buying and sitting in a house for 20 years with one deed. Another example is taking cryptocurrency as payment in exchange for your services. Over years, it is hard to nearly impossible to know what your cost base is. The tax man comes knocking on the door and none of the accounting and tax people you reach out to can handle your digital currencies. I see this as a computer science problem, an AI problem. In the end, this is all going to be done with AI. The entire financial industry has to be reconfigured to account for all of these digital transactions. I look at the digital asset industry as a $100 trillion space that needs to be served. Let me give you some really interesting statistics of how young this industry is. There are more than 50 million Americans who own crypto, or 20% of the adult population, per a recent survey commissioned by Coinbase. Only an estimated 1.62% of cryptocurrency investors declared their crypto to tax authorities in 2022. So, there is a huge gap between those that are holding digital assets and those who have accounted for it and filed it on their tax form. I would say less than 10% of the people that have filed taxes in the United States on digital assets have done it correctly, because it is such a vastly different approach. There is a different methodology used to track crypto and that means all crypto, whether that's DeFi projects, NFTs, smart contracts, or Ethereum, Bitcoin, or any of the other obscure altcoins. What we are really talking about is a whole industry that needs to get built around the digital asset world, including the metaverse. The problem is we do not have it built even a little bit, like when we introduced the first automobile and we did not have any roads, any highways. We did not have seatbelts, helmets, stop signs, stop lights, or even a maximum speed limit. And, if you go back, you will see how much of a big fight that was. Safety belts and speeding limits were a monster fight. We were never going to give up our right to go as fast as we wanted. Today, we have speed limits and police officers that enforce that, and even digital apps that track your driving behavior. I can make the case that all industries are built exactly the way Bitcoin and the crypto world are being built. You first create the product and then you build the rails and the regulations and the processes by which to track all this behavior, but always AFTER the Initial Idea is launched, ChatGPT is a good example. GDPR in Europe around data sharing and credit card processing was introduced less than 10 years ago in a market that's 70 years old. All guardrails get put up after problems are discovered. They do not get put up prior to a market being in place. So, this is very, very natural what is happening. We are at the beginning and what we are seeing now is a significant amount of mature, well-funded people starting to move from the analog world. We have the largest exodus of intellectual capital from Wall Street today moving into the digital asset space. There will be an entire industry built to bridge the gap between the analog 20 th - century constructs and the 21 st - century digital age and I want to play a significant role in shaping the industry. Hortz: How do you go about finding the right companies to invest in? Cardone: I am pretty plugged into this space. I mean, one of the things that is remarkably interesting about this space, unlike the analog world, is that you can meet everyone, as it is a very open-minded industry, all looking for great minds they can collaborate with. That is why I go to the big Bitcoin-type shows, the consensus-type shows, and meet the players. Hortz: What are the criteria you use for picking the right companies like Node 40 and others? What do you look for? Cardone: Well, first thing is I look for the people. To me, technology, any technology that you or I would invest in today, we can do all the due diligence we want, but that technology must change tomorrow for it to be relevant. If I perform due diligence on technology today, and it does not change, I am probably buying a dead company. So, I look for people, I look for the ethics inside those people, and what are they trying to achieve? Are they trying just to make a bunch of money or improve conditions? Are they trying to build a really good product that serves other people? Is their operation sustainable and malleable? Most founders, I have noticed, underprice their product and do not fully understand its applicability. They may be brilliant at building a software solution or technology, but they might not fully understand how to actually get that product into the market and priced correctly or have a too narrowly focused understanding of where it fits in the industry. I look for teams that do not have so much ego that they do not want help from somewhere, from another person, another perspective, someone that has been successful before planting a flag in a large industry that is either being created or being disrupted. Just because you found an idea does not mean that you are a great executor of a business. Even the greatest athletes in the world need a coach, a trainer. With emerging companies, I search for a team that is malleable and understands that having an idea or building a product is only one part of building a great business; that are open to get help to realize all the things that come with building a company that can shape industries, that can lead the way and create sustainable, important companies. That is when I get excited! The problem with this particular industry, like most early stage industries, is that the customer does not really know what they need. So, the companies that I look for are companies that are not only building technology, but they can communicate the value of that technology as it relates to that person's business and pain points. The examples I use of new customer needs are the accounting firms, the Baker Tilly’s’ of the world, the RSMs, even the Ernst & Youngs and PwCs. These companies are going to serve the digital world and will find the tools that Node40 is building as vital. Few analog players have spent the past 5 years making investments to serve that digital world. None of these legacy companies are going to build any of this. They are going to buy it. You do not have the time to build any of this now from scratch. It is too late. It does not matter how much money Visa, MC or AMEX has. Hortz: Any final thoughts to share on how to look at this industry from an investment perspective? Cardone: This is going to be a great space, an unparalleled space. I like industries and companies that solve the problems that all the politicians are griping about. I want to invest in the companies that help build the infrastructure necessary to make it safe and scalable. I want to invest to build the rails and guideposts necessary to shape this industry so that regulators eventually conclude that digital assets are the safest place to be, an inevitable future for all humanity. The digital future is a reality, we are not going back to 8 track tapes and paper ledgers, that is for certain, and being a part of building solutions that serve what I think shall be a multi-trillion dollar industry, that currently is less than $.5 billion, is the biggest no-brainer, at least for me and the way I look at the world and manage risk and investments. I am probably for the next year and a half going to focus on fraud forensics, tracking and tracing. We are getting ready to do another raise for Node40 as part of that. Part of that raise is to buy talent, and possibly accumulate other companies that may have key understanding and solutions tangential to ours and are institutional grade.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4612717-getting-serious-about-blockchain-and-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/14044096.jpeg

The organizations named by the CSA include:  Financial Standard Commission FSC Canada  Financial Commission/Finacom PLC Ltd.  Blockchain Association  European Financial Services and Exchange Commission  Crypto Conduct Authority/Crypto Frugal Ltd. (Ireland)  Crypto Conduct Authority/Crypto Frugal Ltd. (U.K.)  International Regulatory & Brokerage E-markets  British Investment Commission/BIC PLC Ltd.  International Financial Market Supervisory Authority  Crypto Commission Authority/Crypto Commission Ltd.  The CSA did not provide any evidence of wrongdoing by the named groups, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CoinDesk.  Most of the groups don’t have any sort of web presence. One exception is The Financial Commission – operated by Finacom – which runs the Blockchain Association (not to be confused with the lobby group in Washington D.C.).  “Anyone considering using a crypto firm that claims to be certified or a member of a dispute resolution organization should try to independently verify that the referenced organization actually exists,” said the CSA in a statement.  On its website, the Financial Commission provides an address in Hong Kong’s Wan Chai district that’s commonly used to register companies and a phone number from a Brooklyn, New York, area code.  “We are a legitimate company and do not agree with the characterization of our business,” a spokesperson for the group told CoinDesk.  Filings from Hong Kong’s corporate registry show it's registered to Alexey Pavlenko, who is listed on the website as a board member of the organization. Pavlenko is also listed as a director for the firm's U.K entity.  The Financial Commission's Blockchain Association unit also rejected the CSA's characterization.  ""We do not agree with the information in the CSA’s notice and believe the regulator made a mistake,"" Chief Operating Officer Nikolai Isayev said in an email to CoinDesk. ""We have already engaged legal counsel in Canada and preparing a submission to CSA to remove this designation. We expect this issue to be resolved soon.""  The group has had a handful of members over the years, but has not provided any services in the last two years and is currently in a dormant state, he said.  The majority of the members of the Financial Commission are foreign currency trading brokerages. The only notable blockchain company is YouHolder, a centralized yield platform.

The agencies have been working together for a number of years but have now made the cooperation official with the announcement made on the 20th of June. A New Anti-Crime Task Force The joint task force called the Darknet Marketplace and Digital Currency Crimes Task Force, was announced on the 20th of June. Representatives from the Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Arizona, The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Office for the United States Attorneys, and the Postal Inspection Service signed the memorandum of understanding to formally create the new joint task force. “On the 15th of June, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Arizona Special Agent in Charge Scott Brown, U.S. Attorney Gary M. Restaino, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Al Childress, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Special Agent in Charge Cheri Oz, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service acting Inspector in Charge Greg Torbenson signed a memorandum of understanding memorializing the Darknet Marketplace and Digital Currency Crimes Task Force.” Despite the creation of the new task force, it is well known that all agencies involved have been cooperating and working together on a number of cases since 2017. “Since 2017, these federal partners have focused on darknet drug vendors and cryptocurrency-enabled crimes. Ever-evolving technology has allowed drug traffickers and other criminal actors to expand into the digital world and use the darknet to engage in their illegal activity.” The newly created joint task force will work on the investigation of cryptocurrency-related and enabled crimes such as money laundering, drug trafficking, theft of personal information, and child exploitation. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Arizona Special Agent in Charge Scott Brown stated, “HSI and our partners have been working at the forefront of combating criminal activities facilitated through the use of cryptocurrency on dark web marketplaces and other anonymous platforms. This task force will have impactful repercussions on those criminal operators who attempt to grow their businesses and launder the illicit proceeds through advancing technology. HSI looks forward to growing in this investigative space alongside our law enforcement partners.” Specialized Law Enforcement Units The past year has seen law enforcement agencies worldwide create specialized units for crypto-related enforcement action. In late 2022, Interpol created a crypto crimes unit to deal with cryptocurrency-related crimes. Local police in several Canadian cities have also started forming local task forces. Keeping this in mind, the newly created Darknet Marketplace and Digital Currency Crimes Task Force will have a global reach, thanks to Homeland Security Investigations having 93 overseas locations spread across 56 countries. Homeland Security Investigations, through its investigations last year, seized nearly $4 billion worth of cryptocurrency. “Working with businesses and industries that manage the very financial systems terrorists and criminal organizations seek to exploit. Homeland Security Investigations seized nearly $4 BILLION in cryptocurrency from illicit activities last year.” Within the United States of America, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) created a Virtual Asset Exploitation Unit. The unit has been designated to work with the Justice Department’s National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also doubled its Cyber Unit.

Katherine Stadler, a bankruptcy attorney appointed in March to check fees, said lawyers and other professionals had already racked up nearly 35,000 billable hours, equivalent to four solid person-years of work, by the end of January.  “These proceedings appear on track to be very expensive by any measure,” said Stadler, citing costs that already amount to 2% of estate assets and 10% of reported cash, with 46 of the 242 attorneys assigned to the case charged over $2,000 an hour.  ""What makes these cases extraordinary… is the largely unregulated financial system in which the Debtors (and other similar financial technology companies) operate,” she said, citing the “nonexistence of even the most basic corporate governance” at Sam Bankman-Fried’s exchange, a description which echoes criticism leveled by new CEO John J Ray III.  “Very few firms could have accomplished what these professionals accomplished in 90 days…transforming a smoldering heap of wreckage into a functioning Chapter 11 debtor-in-possession,” Stadler said, describing the period immediately following the declaration of bankruptcy as “an ‘all hands on deck’ crisis.”  While broadly content, Stadler called for some of the fees to be slashed, and she asked lead counsel Sullivan & Cromwell to reduce its $42 million bill by some $650,000, for deficiencies such as overstaffing, excessive meetings and vague paperwork.  Ray has been attempting to settle the exchange’s affairs since it collapsed in November, and some of his filings hint at an attempt to reboot operations as FTX 2.0.

It is noteworthy that there are 52,079 holders of TrueUSD; however, the top 10 wallets dominate 83.31% of the circulating supply. Notably, Binance stands out as the largest holder, possessing 389,561,743 TrueUSD tokens in its leading address. Additionally, Binance controls five out of the top ten addresses with the highest TrueUSD holdings. TUSD: Wallet Distribution And Minting Pause One wallet contains 45,233,811 TUSD, another has precisely 28,000,000, there’s one with 10,601,602, and lastly, one holds 10,270,001 TrueUSD tokens.

42420191,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUa5U5,1687334400,Digital Euro: The Bill Is Ready but Politicians Aren’t Convinced,"The European Central Bank (ECB) and European Commission are beavering away at the technical details for a digital euro – but among political decision-makers it appears hard to muster much enthusiasm for the putative central bank digital currency (CBDC).  New laws to underpin the CBDC propose a raft of answers to questions on privacy, offline use and distribution, and now seem set to be published next week – but, if the technical issues are ripe, the political ones aren’t.  Perhaps understandably, the bill focuses on what the CBDC should not do – banning holdings from getting too large, or being paid interest, in an explicit bid to stop the CBDC competing with savings or investment.  What’s missing, politicians now complain, is the positive case for what the CBDC should be there to do – which may be responsible for some of the late-stage hiccups in producing the formal legislative proposal.  At a meeting last week, euro finance ministers discussed “the importance of developing a compelling and clear narrative regarding what would be the added value of this development and the difference that it would make to the lives of the citizens of Europe and to the commercial activity of businesses,” said Ireland’s Paschal Donohoe, who chaired their talks.  Donohoe has been broadly positive about the project, saying in a March OpEd that issuance was inevitably needed to protect the euro’s value and sovereignty from foreign rivals. But ministers have also stressed the project must command public support – and now, it seems, want reminding about why the project should go ahead in the first place.  Proponents at the ECB say the digital euro could become a monetary anchor, ensuring citizens can still get access to state-issued money in a digital era; others go further and argue it could be a way of bypassing the unstable commercial banking system altogether.  Uphill struggle  Yet making that case to citizens can be an uphill struggle. An ECB focus group last year found that few in the general public, even the tech-savvy ones, had heard of a digital euro, or knew much about it.  That skepticism is shared in the European Parliament, the directly elected arm of the EU legislature that would also have to agree to any underpinning laws. A recent debate revealed a wide range of concerns – from fears of replacing physical cash, to worries it could accompany a Chinese-style social credit system. (The commission says the digital euro would complement cash as legal tender, and isn’t a “big brother” initiative).  Other lawmakers simply wonder what the point is.  “If we are just duplicating the existing payment infrastructure with the digital euro, I do not see a strong case,” Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the largest political grouping in the European Parliament’s economic affairs committee, told CoinDesk in an email – even if capabilities relating to blockchain or smart contracts would be a boost. “A lot depends on the details and the precise design elements.”  “The European Central Bank and the European Commission have yet to make a clear and convincing case of why we need the digital euro,” added Ferber, from the German center-right CSU party. “Vague notions of ‘monetary sovereignty’ do not cut it for most people.”  The problem may lie in the relative sophistication of the EU’s existing payment networks, which already offers regular citizens a host of digital ways to pay.  Officials aren’t comfortable that in practice they usually involve U.S. companies – Visa, Mastercard, potentially in future big tech – putting the bloc at the mercy of erratic U.S. sanctions policy. But in practice, citizens in countries like Belgium can go from one month to another without touching a banknote, thanks to smartphones, cards and instant transfers. What else does a digital euro bring?  Confusion  Some believe that confusion is a deliberate attempt by commercial banks to head off rivalry from the state.  Commercial banks “hate this project, because it creates competition with their private payment methods,” Anna Martin of consumers’ organization BEUC told a Brussels event on Monday.  “This narrative is already floating about in the public sphere that it will not bring added value,” said Martin, who is Financial Services Officer at the lobby group. “If we have a public payment method, we have something which brings us additional privacy, we have something which brings us additional financial inclusion, and if we get this right, then we should go ahead.”  With competing visions about what the digital euro is for, from the role of blockchain to the role of banks, it’s unclear if the CBDC can command a coherent political consensus ahead of European elections due in June 2024 – but some are still optimistic.  “My educated guess is that a majority in the parliament will support the digital euro proposal in the end,” said Ferber. “But things would be made a lot easier if there were a stronger case for the project.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/06/21/digital-euro-the-bill-is-ready-but-politicians-arent-convinced,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/041df2f0af357781e0a100b97c42562b382c0ec9-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Outside of majors, bitcoin cash (BCH) added 15%, stacks (STX) surged 21%, and tokens of “Chinese Ethereum” conflux (CFX) rose as much as 30% as traders likely bet on outsized gains for these tokens in the future.  Overall crypto market capitalization rose 5% over the past 24 hours, adding nearly $50 billion in value. The surge caused $125 million in short liquidations across crypto-tracked futures, as per CoinGlass.  Traders shorting bitcoin lost $54 million, followed by ether, sui (SUI) and XRP, data shows. Shorts are bets against the rise in the price of any asset.  Liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or complete loss of the trader’s initial margin. This happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Hopes surrounding a potential U.S. Bitcoin ETF filing by investment giant BlackRock fueled a bullish sentiment among some traders last week. Some crypto experts believe that if the filing is approved it could lead to large inflows for bitcoin and subsequently further gains in the market.  “Blackrock’s ETF presents a statement or unique ‘solution’ if you will that makes it different from previous ETF filings,” shared Eitan Katz, CEO of Kima, in a Telegram message. “It includes a surveillance sharing agreement with Nasdaq, which means that Nasdaq will have access to the trading data, including customer IDs –all with the intention to make it significantly more immune to market manipulations by traders.”  “Should the application be approved as many are speculating based on BlackRock’s success rates in its ETF filings, it will lend legitimacy to the cryptocurrency which is bound to draw in more investors including corporate and high net-worth individuals,” Katz added.",POSITIVE,ADA | BCH | CFX,ADA | BCH | MARKET | TRADING | CFX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/cardano-ether-surge-as-bitcoin-led-rally-sees-short-traders-lose-125m,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd6d7f3dcc7690e7b3d8916310d6113caeba5c7a-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the digital currency landscape continues to evolve, investors and enthusiasts have been closely monitoring the token’s performance, eagerly awaiting signs of a potential turnaround. With concerns mounting, many are left wondering: is there a silver lining ahead for ApeCoin, or is it destined to remain trapped in the grips of a prolonged downward trend? Can ApeCoin Bulls Find Strength Amid The Downtrend? In recent months, ApeCoin APE has experienced a significant decline, with its price plummeting by over 55% from its mid-April swing highs of approximately $4.5 to its current value of $2.17 at the time of writing, according to a new APE price report. Related Reading: PEPE Jumps Nearly 10% In 24 Hours, Sparking Speculation Of A New Rally Although the cryptocurrency rallied by 6.4% in the past 24 hours, the 14-day chart reveals a substantial slump of 27.2%. Adding to the bearish sentiment, the trendline resistance has proven to be a formidable obstacle, hindering any potential upside movement. Source: CoinMarketCap Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has been exhibiting lower highs since late January, indicating a notable decrease in buying pressure. This decline in demand is further corroborated by the decreasing On Balance Volume (OBV). The convergence of these negative indicators has reinforced the control of sellers and raised the possibility of APE dropping below the $2.0 mark. In fact, there is speculation that the cryptocurrency could potentially reach $1.0, its initial opening price on the Binance exchange. Keeping An Eye On Bitcoin Despite the prevailing downtrend, there is a glimmer of hope for bullish investors as Bitcoin has now rebounded above the $27,000 threshold.

14040574,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538883,1687333517,"Bitcoin Hits $138,000 On Binance US, What Happened?","The Bitcoin price has been experiencing a sharp rally since last Thursday, when BlackRock filed its application for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Since hitting its local low of $24,819 right along the Tether FUD, the BTC price has risen by over 16% since the BlackRock news broke. Bitcoin Hits $138,070 On Binance US However, this is in no way an explanation for the following news: Some Binance US users are reporting that the Bitcoin price has hit a whopping price of over $138,000 on the exchange. The popular Twitter account @MikeBurgersburg wrote: “Lololololol- Bitcoin hit $138,070 on Binance US a little bit ago. Everything ok over there, CZ?”. The anomaly was also shared by Twitter user @OperationAjax, who posted the screenshot below, writing: “I think someone broke the moneymaker on @BinanceUS lol. Someone put them on “UltraWASH Mode” and sent #BTC/ Tether to $140,000/BTC.” At press time, neither Binance US nor Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao have commented on the anomaly in the Bitcoin price. Therefore, it can only be speculated what happened. The most likely explanation is an internal data glitch. But, other reasons are also conceivable, such as insufficient liquidity on the exchange, which led to the phenomenal price. As market data provider Kaiko reported yesterday, Binance US trading volumes have plummeted since the beginning of the year. Related Reading: SEC Sues Binance, Coinbase Then BlackRock Files For Bitcoin Spot ETF; Is This An Inside Job? “The U.S. crypto exchange market is more fraught than ever,” Kaiko wrote via Twitter, sharing the chart below, which shows that Binance US’s share of the American market has plummeted from 8% at the start of the year to 1.5% currently. However, against the theory of insufficient liquidity speaks the fact that the price is currently no longer displayed on Binance US. In this respect, a data error seems more likely. Pressure On Binance May Increase Further Meanwhile, pressure on Binance in the US could continue to mount, even though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Binance US reached a tentative agreement last Friday, 16 June, over the threat of an asset freeze. As NewsBTC reported, the proposed measures include restricting Binance officials’ access to private keys and disclosing business expenses. The settlement still needs to be approved by the relevant federal judge. Related Reading: Bitcoin Breaks Out Of Ichimoku Cloud, Storms Toward $28,000 Otherwise, Travis Kling, former equity portfolio manager and senior investment adviser at Ikigai Asset Management, commented via Twitter that there is currently a lot of chatter about the Blackrock Bitcoin ETF, “and rightfully so.” However, Kling sees Binance as an obstacle to the ETF, indirectly implying that Operation Choke Point 2.0 is not over yet: One thing I’ll say- there is no chance, and I mean zero, that this ETF is approved with Binance in its current position of market dominance. If this ETF is approved, Binance is either gone entirely or their role in price discovery is massively diminished. If Binance holds on to its current level of influence, no chance this ETF is approved. At press time, the Bitcoin price was at $28,859, breaking the downtrend that persisted since mid-April this year.

Obadia’s departure comes amidst sweeping personnel changes at Flashbots as the company looks to raise funds at a valuation of $1 billion. Serious Challenges Ahead Flashbots was founded to counter the negative consequences of MEV extraction techniques on Ethereum. Alex Obadia, one of the company’s co-founders and co-lead of the strategy division, announced his departure from the Paradigm-backed company. In a farewell letter posted on Twitter, Obadia offered his thanks and gratitude towards the company, along with the friendships built and lessons learned. However, he also used the letter to warn of serious challenges that lay ahead for the company. In the letter, Obadia stated that the system Flashbots was designed to protect was still vulnerable to centralization. “The system we committed to protect is still vulnerable to centralization from phenomena such as cross-domain MEV and exclusive order flow. To top it off, as we’ve grown into an incumbent, we now also need to protect the system against ourselves to avoid becoming the very Moloch we’re fighting against.” Obadia was one of the earliest employees at Flashbot after it was founded in 2020 and held the formal title of “founding steward” of the company. However, he did not dwell on the reason why he was leaving the company, stating, “I leave for multiple reasons, some more personal than others, but really what it boils down to is that I feel my vision and values will be better served somewhere else. We’ve often had differing opinions within leadership, and that has been part of our strength. However, I believe we will now achieve better results going our separate ways.” A Flashbots representative thanked Obadia for his contributions towards the company, Flashbots ecosystem, and the crypto industry in general. Obadia has suggested that he is open to collaborating with Flashbots in the future. A Fund Raise In The Works Flashbots creates software that facilitates the extraction of MEV or Maximal Extractable Value, which is extra profit that can be earned by strategically ordering how the transactions are organized into blocks that are written to the blockchain’s ledger. Flashbot’s MEV-Boost middleware is used by nearly all validators that help in Ethereum operations. Furthermore, the upcoming SUAVE network also aims to offer similar MEV-extracting functionality to other major blockchains. Flashbots is also on the verge of announcing a Series B funding round. The round will reportedly value the firm at $1 billion. It will help secure funding for MEV research and development as Flashbots works towards the launch of SUAVE and their vision to democratize and distribute MEV to other blockchains. Sweeping Personnel Changes With the impending Series B funding round looming, Flashbots has also seen significant personnel changes. One of the most high-profile new hires is Andrew Miller. Miller joins the Flashbots team as a research lead and will work on Trusted Execution Environments and SUAVE. Miller is also well known for being one of the researchers who successfully broke Intel’s SGX code. This required a significant and massive overhaul of the secret blockchain and had security ramifications far beyond the crypto ecosystem. Miller has also been working as the associate director of the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3). He is also the assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, from where he will be taking a leave of absence as he gears up to take his new role with Flashbots. Other prominent hires joining Flashbots are Daniel Marzec, an engineer at Blocknative, another major MEV industry player, and Danning Sui, formerly the head of data science at the decentralized finance (DeFi) firm 0x. Marzec will be joining Flashbots as a research engineer, while Sui will lead the Flashbots’ data science team. So far, Flashbots has added 13 new team members over the past six months, taking the total size of the team to over 50. A representative for Flashbots stated, “Flashbots is working closer towards its goal to illuminate, democratize and distribute the dark forest.” Dark Forest refers to the competition between different blockchain players to squeeze out MEV.

The investment bank said the SEC may now focus on bringing stablecoins, including the two largest by market cap, tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), and decentralized finance protocols into regulatory compliance.  The SEC said earlier this month that it was suing crypto exchange Binance, its founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao and the operating company for Binance.US on allegations of violating federal securities laws. A day later it sued rival exchange Coinbase (COIN) on similar charges.  If the SEC is looking to reduce the potential for unregulated DeFi protocols to serve as viable alternatives to regulated lenders and exchanges, then they could “target the stablecoins that serve as the lifeblood of decentralized finance,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  By targeting these stablecoins, the SEC may also weaken the DeFi ecosystem, the report said.  Berenberg says that if USDC is targeted by U.S. regulators, the impact on Coinbase’s revenue could be significant, noting that in first-quarter 2023 the exchange generated $199 million in net revenue – about 27% of the total – from interest income earned on USDC reserves.  Bitcoin (BTC), which the SEC has affirmed as a commodity rather than an unregistered security, is likely to be the ultimate beneficiary of the crackdown, the note said.  MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares are well positioned to outperform, given the company’s focus on acquiring and holding bitcoins, as the regulatory clampdown will likely give rise to a U.S. crypto industry that is more bitcoin-focused than it has been in recent years, the report added.

Preparations for the same have already begun, with investors seeking bitcoin futures and options that expire two months after the pivotal event known to significantly impact the cryptocurrency's price, according to Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange by trading volume and open interest.  The Panama-based exchange has decided to list the June 2024 expiry futures and options on Thursday at 08:00 UTC, preponing the launch by a week to cater to the user demand.  ""Normally, Deribit would introduce the June 2024 options and futures next week at the June 2023 quarterly expiry. However, with the halving expected in April, clients have requested us to list them earlier to facilitate the trading of these contracts ahead of the regular listing date,"" Deribit's Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers told CoinDesk.  ""For derivatives desks & dealers having the ability to trade on exchange is important as it reduces their overall capital requirements and allows them to hedge their exposure relating to bilateral/OTC positions,"" Strijers added.  Futures are financial derivative contracts that obligate parties to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined future date and price. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy, while the put confers the right to sell.  Futures work as a hedge against future market volatility. Options are mainly used to hedge or reduce the portfolio's risk exposure. Sophisticated traders often buy options or futures to take a leveraged bullish or bearish bet on the underlying asset at a lower cost.  Bitcoin's impending halving will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC. Historically, bitcoin has rallied in the months leading up to the supply-altering event and seen price pullbacks following the event.  If history is a guide, there could be plenty of directional volatility in the next 12 months – more so as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to decide on BlackRock's spot-based BTC ETF application early next year.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/06/21/bitcoin-june-2024-expiry-futures-and-options-in-high-demand-due-to-mining-reward-halving-deribit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/51df95f7cced2a2f5934e3bebf893fd38b187793-1280x853.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

14037845,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/polygon-eyes-sidechain-upgrade-to-zkevm-validium-matic,1687327200,Polygon Eyes Sidechain Upgrade To zkEVM Validium $MATIC,"Polygon co-founder Mihailo Bjelic has proposed a notable upgrade to the Polygon proof-of-stake (PoS) network. According to a forum post dated June 20, Bjelic suggested transforming the PoS network into a 'zkEVM validium' version, leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to bolster security. Polygon's Adoption of zkEVM and the Validium Model Polygon PoS, an Ethereum scaling solution established in 2019, currently manages over $900 million in total value locked within its contracts, processing over two million transactions each day. A second network, Polygon zkEVM, launched in March, utilizes zero-knowledge proof rollups to scale Ethereum. In Bjelic's proposal, the original PoS network would also be upgraded to a zkEVM, or zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine, version. The principal difference with the recently launched network is that the new Polygon PoS would not function as a ""rollup"". Instead, it would operate as a ""validium"", storing only validation proofs on the layer 1, while keeping the actual transaction data on a separlate chain. Security Enhancement and Lower Fees This approach would allow the Polygon PoS to feature lower transaction fees than Polygon zkEVM, contributing to increased usage. Moreover, the upgrade could potentially improve the security of Polygon PoS by enabling it to inherit Ethereum’s security. In the future, Polygon zkEVM might be deployed for high-value transactions where security is a top priority. Simultaneously, Polygon PoS could be the preferred network for gaming and social media enthusiasts requiring high transaction volume and lower transaction fees. Polygon 2.0 and Data Availability The transformation of Polygon PoS and the launch of Polygon zkEVM form part of a grander plan by the team to create a “Supernet”. This ambitious project, also known as ""Polygon 2.0"", aims to unite various application-specific chains. Zero-knowledge proofs are seen as a significant advancement in blockchain technology, and data availability will play a key role in unlocking their full potential. According to Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Polygon, future base-layer blockchain protocols will need to optimize data availability for proofs, verifications, and settlements rather than execution. Avail, a platform spun off from Polygon Labs and led by Arjun, offers infrastructure for ZK-rollups and other off-chain scaling solutions, addressing the current costs associated with submitting ZK-rollups and Optimistic Rollups to the Ethereum mainnet. Bjelic indicated that his informal proposal might evolve into a formal Polygon Improvement Proposal by November, with potential implementation on the mainnet between February and March 2024. If successful, this upgrade could represent a significant leap towards improving the security and performance of Polygon networks. The proposal comes in days after another Polygon upgrade proposal detailed aspects of its governance towards what has been dubbed as an Ecosystem Council.

The move comes after TradFi giant BlackRock filed for an spot ETF last week, which shook up the market. Another peer, WisdomTree, also refiled for an spot ETF on Tuesday, after getting rejected by the SEC in 2022.  Invesco first filed for a bitcoin ETF in In 2021 - also with Galaxy. It also filed for a bitcoin futures ETF, but dropped the effort in October 2021 after a futures ETF by ProShares was approved and began trading first.  In its filing, Invesco argued that the lack of a spot bitcoin ETF pushes investors towards riskier alternatives, as seen in insolvencies like FTX, Celsius Network, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital Holdings.  Invesco also emphasized the need for investor protection, saying that approval for such a spot bitcoin ETF hinges on a surveillance sharing agreement with a significant, regulated market, not on the regulation of the spot bitcoin market itself.  Surveillance-sharing agreements facilitate the exchange of information concerning market trading activity, clearing processes, and customer identification, which would significantly reduce the potential for market manipulation – something the Securities and Exchange Commission is very concerned about.  BlackRock (BLK), in its filing, advocated for the same thing, argued that Nasdaq could be brought in to fill this role.  “The SEC is very concerned with market manipulation related to Bitcoin prices, and has cited this in almost, if not all, previous rejections,” Graeme Moore, Head of Tokenization, at the Polymesh Association, said earlier to CoinDesk. “This is because the SEC’s view is that Coinbase and others are not regulated as exchanges and therefore cannot be trusted to ‘prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices’.”  So far, the SEC hasn’t given any indication as to when it plans to make an announcement regarding a bitcoin ETF.  Grayscale (which, for now, currently shares common ownership with CoinDesk in Digital Currency Group) has sued the SEC over its rejected bitcoin spot ETF. Speaking at CoinDesk’s Consensus conference in Austin, GrayScale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said he expects a decision in the case by September.

On Twitter, he notes that these Wall Street giants only became involved after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) took legal action against Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, and Coinbase, a popular exchange in the United States and Western Europe. Is This An Inside Job? He claimed that the SEC could have colluded with specific players to provide them additional time to catch up. This statement has sparked considerable speculation within the industry. However, there is no evidence to suggest that government regulators, such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), who have filed a lawsuit against Binance, have purposely targeted top cryptocurrency platforms in the United States to enable Wall Street firms to dominate the market. Related Reading: Litecoin Sees 55% Increase In New Daily Addresses As Bullish Sentiment Grows On June 5, the SEC sued Binance, alleging that the exchange was engaged in several illegal activities, including operating an unregistered securities exchange, failing to register as a broker-dealer, and misleading investors about its operations. They also claimed that some of the assets listed by the crypto trading platforms were unregistered securities. The SEC leveled 13 charges against Binance, Changpeng Zhao, the exchange’s CEO, and Binance.US. However, Binance has said it will defend itself against the lawsuit. While the lawsuit is pending in a federal court, the SEC dropped its request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) against Binance.US on June 17, 2023.

Notably, the TRO was less than two days when BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $9 trillion in assets under management, applied for a Bitcoin Spot ETF on June 19. Their decision to file effectively legitimizes Bitcoin as an investment asset. If approved by the SEC, it will provide an avenue for institutional investors to get exposure to Bitcoin. Following BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF application, Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) soared over 12%. At the same time, the discount, which is the difference between GBTC share price and net asset value (NAV) of Grayscale’s Bitcoin holdings, has been decreasing. After the discount fell to 44% on June 14, this value now stands at 36.6%, trackers on June 20 show.

In the meantime, Bitcoin prices are reaping higher, soaring 13% in 5 days. In that sense, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust discount could continue to decrease. This outcome might be the first positive development for the cryptocurrency and the nascent industry.

14030782,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538836,1687311058,Bitcoin Dominance Surges To 50% As BlackRock ETF Filing Fuels Investor Confidence,"Bitcoin is again at 50% market dominance, indicating that the cryptocurrency now accounts for half of the total crypto market cap, valued at $1.052 Trillion. According to data from Tradingview, Bitcoin’s total market dominance crossed above 50% yesterday, June 19, for the first time in months. The news of Bitcoin’s renewed dominance has driven much excitement across the crypto community, with many speculating on the reason for such market growth. However, one possible reason is the news of prominent global asset manager BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This move appeared to have boosted investors’ confidence upon announcement, causing BTC’s price to surge above $28,000 since last month. According to data from CoinMarketCap, BTC is currently trading around $27,432.93, with a 3.13% gain in the last day. The token’s daily trading volume is also up by 83.39%, valued at $17 billion. Meanwhile, Bitcoin currently boasts a staggering market cap of $531.54 billion, covering over 50% of the entire crypto market.

Essentially, a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) mirrors the fluctuations in Bitcoin’s price, granting investors exposure to the cryptocurrency without requiring direct acquisition. The foray of a traditional finance company such as BlackRock, with a valuation of $105.25 billion, into the realm of cryptocurrency carries immense significance. There is even a belief among some industry figures that this ETF application will be accepted in a “short time” despite the high number of ETF rejections usually dished out by the SEC. This will be the first-ever spot market Bitcoin ETF certified by the SEC if approved.

The price of the number one cryptocurrency has fluctuated wildly, reaching an all-time high of over $68,000 before crashing to a low of $26,500. A Bitcoin ETF would be good news for investors as it provides an easy, secure, and regulated way to invest in Bitcoin and diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, a Bitcoin ETF will likely attract more institutional investors who were previously hesitant about getting into crypto because of custody and regulatory concerns. The buzz surrounding the Bitcoin ETF continues to intensify, with additional news emerging that Fidelity Investments, an asset management powerhouse with assets totaling $4.5 trillion, is seeking a regulatory license to provide crypto custody services.

The CoinDesk Market Index is up 4.1% to 1,166.  ""Bitcoin's move above USD $28,000 also comes with the coin's share in the aggregate crypto market cap topping 50% for the first time in two years. Unlike most other digital assets, bitcoin has not been implicated in any of the regulatory complexity, we've seen coming out of the U.S.,” Strahinja Savic, head of data and analytics at Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial told CoinDesk in a note.  Savic says that BlackRock's bitcoin ETF filing has really underscored that institutional interest in bitcoin remains steadfast, despite the sell-off and bankruptcies we've seen earlier this year and in late 2022.  Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BitBull Capital, points to the bitcoin ETF filings as well as the launch of a new institutionally backed crypto exchange called EDX, as a bull case for crypto.  “It wouldn’t be surprising if Bitcoin continues to lead the market for now,” he said. “On the top side, $30k is the obvious resistance.""

The version 3 (v3) blockchain’s total value locked (TVL) has surged 15% since the start of the month to $1.76 billion, data from blockchain analytics firm DefiLlama shows. Aave’s TVL has skyrocketed 300% since Jan. 1, widely outpacing other major cryptos over this period. Bitcoin and ether, the two largest digital assets by market capitalization, have risen about 70% and 50%, respectively, in 2023.  Aave’s gains offer the latest evidence of rising interest in DeFi protocols that eliminate the need for third-party institutions to help execute transactions. A banking crisis that led to the collapse of three major regional banks in March has meanwhile undermined confidence in traditional, financial services organizations that have been central to lending markets.  At presstime, Aave users have supplied $1.83 billion worth of assets and borrowed $641 million on Aave’s version three (v3), per on-chain markets terminal Parsec, highlighting the level of financial activity occurring within the protocol.  The five largest borrowers accounted for more than $227.2 million in assets loaned and roughly $181.4 million in loans, about 28% of total loans on Aave v3. Ether, stablecoins, wrapped bitcoin and liquid staking tokens compose the majority of crypto assets transacted on Aave, reflecting their popularity in the DeFi ecosystem.

14029190,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=538850,1687307451,Polygon Labs Unveils Major Upgrade To Sidechain With ‘zkEVM Validium’ Layer 2,"Polygon Labs, the engineering team behind the popular Polygon PoS (Proof of Stake) chain, has proposed a major upgrade to the network. The upgrade would introduce a “first-of-its-kind” decentralized L2 (Layer 2) secured by zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs, making the Polygon ecosystem more secure, performant, and a core part of the upcoming Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. This upgrade marks a significant milestone in the blockchain industry, as it would be the first time an existing chain, especially of this size and importance, adds ZK proofs to become an L2. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Registers 11% Gains As Broader Market Suffers Volatility Polygon Labs Sets The Bar High Per the announcement, the upgrade proposes using a zkEVM validium, a lower-cost, higher-throughput sibling of a rollup. Rollups, such as Polygon zkEVM, leverage Ethereum to publish transaction data and verify proofs, inheriting its security and decentralization. Moreover, the upgrade will involve the migration of Polygon’s existing PoS to a new PoS network that utilizes the zkEVM technology. The upgraded PoS network, or validium, will operate alongside Polygon’s existing zkEVM rollup network, offering users the benefits of both technologies depending on their specific needs. Existing Polygon PoS validators will play two critical roles in the upgraded ecosystem, guaranteeing data availability and sequencing transactions. By attesting to data availability, Polygon PoS will become the first validium with decentralized and secure data availability guarantees. Validators will also operate the chain by deciding which transactions to include in a block and in which order, preserving decentralization and ensuring that transaction fees flow to MATIC-staked validators. This would make Polygon PoS the first L2 with a decentralized sequencer set. Furthermore, the upgraded PoS network will offer high scalability and low fees, making it an ideal fit for applications with high transaction volume and requiring low transaction fees, such as Web3 gaming and social and micro Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Meanwhile, the existing zkEVM rollup network will continue to offer a high level of security, making it a good solution for applications that process high-value transactions and prioritize security, such as high-value DeFi applications. Polygon’s 2.0 vision for scalability and unified liquidity, powered by ZK technology, aims to make every Polygon chain a ZK L2. However, Polygon PoS, in its current state, is secured by its validators, not by ZK proofs. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For Consolidation In This Price Zone Prior To Attempting Reversal According to the announcement, the upgrade is currently in the Pre-Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) stage, with the proposal already live on the governance forum. Assuming it gathers significant support from the community, a formal PIP will be put forward, initiating the prescribed processes. The proposal will then be discussed on PPG (Polygon Protocol Governance) Calls, governance forums, and other public venues to gather consensus from all relevant ecosystem participants. The implementation could go live on Mainnet by the end of Q1 2024 if a consensus is reached.
