42403292,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfT3d,1568328208,CME Files to Double Monthly Bitcoin Futures Open Position Limit to 10K BTC,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME Group) wants to let bitcoin futures traders hold a greater number of open positions at one time.  CME announced its intention to increase in the so-called spot month position limit for its bitcoin futures contracts in a letter to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Thursday.  The limit would jump from 1,000 contracts per spot month to 2,000 for any single investor. Since each contract is for five bitcoin, the change means a trader’s maximum exposure would double from 5,000 bitcoin (worth about $50 million at current prices) to 2,000 contracts (10,000 bitcoin, or $100 million).  To be sure, few traders if any holding that many open positions right now, given that the exchange saw the number of open interest contracts reach an all-time high around 6,100 in July.  But the company sees room for this market to grow, and is seeking to increase these limits ""based on the significant growth and acceptance of our financially-settled CME Bitcoin futures markets, as well as our analysis of the underlying bitcoin market,"" said the spokesperson.  If the CFTC does not object to the plan, the move will take effect on Sept. 30 for the October 2019 contract, wrote CME managing director and chief regulatory counsel Christopher Bowen in the letter.  Guardrails  According to the CFTC, position limits are designed to prevent ""excessive speculation"" in any commodities which underpin a futures product.  The concern is that without these limits, excessive speculation in a particular futures contract might cause the underlying asset’s price to fluctuate suddenly.  ""In general, position limits are not needed for markets where the threat of market manipulation is non-existent or very low,"" the CFTC website states.  As such, CME’s move on Thursday can be seen as a sign that the bitcoin market is maturing, as well as a sign that bitcoin futures contracts are better understood than they were previously.  Under the plan, the single month accountability level would remain at 5,000 contracts, meaning CME would continue to scrutinize only those traders whose open positions exceed the threshold.  A good year  CME launched its cash-settled futures contract at the end of 2017, alongside cross-town rival Cboe. However, Cboe announced in March that it would be shutting down its futures market, leaving CME as the sole exchange to offer the product in the U.S.  While CME is currently the only exchange to offer bitcoin futures in the country, the Intercontinental Exchange, through its ICE Futures US wing and Bakkt subsidiary, plans to offer physically-settled futures contracts later this month. A number of other companies are also looking to offer physically settled futures and forwards products.  The exchange has seen “20 successful, uneventful settlements,” the spokesperson said. It currently has a record number of large open interest holders at 56, and now sees an average daily volume of 7,100 contracts overall.  More than 1,200 traders have signed onto the platform since the beginning of 2019.  ""This is one more way we’re providing customers, institutional traders and end-users with additional flexibility to trade and hedge bitcoin price risk,"" the spokesperson said.

42403299,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfTAW,1568324707,"$2 Billion Lost in Mt. Gox Bitcoin Hack Can Be Recovered, Lawyer Claims","The Takeaway:  Moscow-based law firm ZP Legal claims to have identified Russian nationals who received bitcoin stolen in the 2014 hack of Mt Gox.  Local law enforcement is investigating Alexander Vinnik, the alleged operator of the defunct exchange BTC-e.  ZP Legal says Mt Gox creditors who come forward as potential BTC-e victims may help Russian authorities establish a connection between the exchanges.  To cut a deal with law enforcement, those who benefited from the Mt Gox hack might offer to return funds to the exchange's creditors, the law firm reckons.      While creditors of the defunct Mt Gox bitcoin exchange wait for the Japanese courts to resolve the fate of their money, a Moscow-based law firm is proposing a different solution.  According to Mt Gox creditors, ZP Legal contacted them earlier this year, offering an opportunity to recover almost a quarter of the missing 850,000 bitcoins stolen in the 2014 hack of the exchange. (The coins were worth more than $450 million at the time of the theft and $8.5 billion today.)  ZP Legal estimated 170,000 to 200,000 of these coins, currently worth $1.7 billion to $2 billion, can be recovered by taking legal action against Russian nationals who received the stolen money.  In return for its assistance, the law firm will charge creditors 50 to 75 percent of the recovered sum, as well as an hourly rate. However, ZP Legal says it will only accept payment in the event of a successful recovery.  Alexander Zheleznikov, the managing partner of ZP Legal (ZP stands for Zheleznikov and Partners), said he believed that some of the money stolen from Mt Gox might have ended up on another defunct crypto exchange, BTC-e. In fact, this longstanding claim has been investigated by former Mt Gox user Kim Nilsson and alleged in an order by the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California.  Following this order, the alleged operator of BTC-e, Russian national Alexander Vinnik, was arrested in July 2017 in Greece and is now facing extradition to the U.S., Russia or France to face trial over money laundering charges.  Zheleznikov believes the criminal case against Vinnik, which Russian authorities are also investigating, can be accelerated if Mt Gox creditors come forward as victims and help law enforcement establish a connection between Mt Gox, BTC-e, and BTC-e's successor, the also-failed Russian exchange WEX.  ""Our plan is to represent the Mt.Gox creditors and help them report to Russian law enforcement so that the investigators could establish the connection between the stolen funds from Mt Gox, the operations of BTC-e and WEX, using Vinnik's case,"" Zheleznikov said. He added:  ""If our assumptions of those connections are correct, the [thieves] will ultimately come forward and plead guilty, and to reduce the punishment, they will offer to recover a part of the funds. If they don't, they will be deemed guilty by law enforcement, and then there will be a chance to sue them for damages based on the criminal case.""  International overtures  Zheleznikov said his firm reached out to lawyers representing the Mt Gox creditors, and later the creditors themselves, with the help of the Russian embassy in Tokyo. (The embassy did not respond to a request for comment.)  Andy Pag, the founder and former coordinator of the largest group of creditors, Mt. Gox Legal (MGL), said he was first contacted by the firm on Feb. 22, soon after ZP engaged with the Japanese lawyers working on the Mt Gox case.  ""Lawyers for ZP held meetings in Tokyo with the creditors, and separately with the Mt. Gox Legal (MGL) insolvency lawyers, MHM Japan, on Feb. 15, 2019. I was the coordinator of MGL at the time so MHM made the introduction,"" said Pag, who stepped down from Mt. Gox Legal at the end of March  He went on to add:  ""There was a long hiatus after that, but more recently they re-contacted me asking me to help them devise their process for verifying individuals are valid victims of the theft, and a process to reach those individuals.""  According to a creditors’ discussion on a closed forum, ZP Legal claimed to have recovered as much as $1 million of funds on behalf of an unnamed client of the Russian crypto exchange WEX.  Zheleznikov refused to discuss the sum with CoinDesk but confirmed his firm worked with two people whose money was frozen at WEX. ZP Legal started its own investigation and the police started a preliminary investigation, and soon some people reached out to the firm and offered to compensate the WEX users' losses, he said.  The firm connected the two sides and the next thing Zheleznikov heard was the victims telling him that ""the matter was resolved,"" he told CoinDesk. He refused to name either of the people involved in that deal.  Managing expectations  According to a document shared by Pag, ZP Legal told Mt Gox creditors that through a “close cooperation with law enforcement” it believed it could recover “up to 170,000 - 200,000 BTC.”  At the same time, the firm admitted it doesn't know the identities of all people involved in the theft — it will be up to law enforcement to find the culprits. Speaking to CoinDesk, Zheleznikov said the amount is an estimate based on the number of creditors ZP hopes to take on as clients.  Zheleznikov stressed that his clients can expect to receive not bitcoins themselves but their fiat value now.  “I don’t promise to recover bitcoins,” Zheleznikov told CoinDesk. “Only those funds will be recovered that a court will be able to forfeit.”  In the document Pag shared with the creditors, ZP describes how the loss will be calculated.  “If you held a balance on Mt Gox of say 100 BTC on the day it closed, to calculate your Russian police claim you must convert this to hard currency based on the current rate, for instance $10,000/[BTC] means your claim will be $1,000,000, in Roubles,” the document says.  A potential problem with this approach is that digital assets have no legal status in Russia at the moment, as in many other jurisdictions, and there is no clear methodology for valuing cryptocurrency. Zheleznikov admits that his firm will be acting in the absence of settled practices.  “We’re not sure [we will be able to convince the police to trust our estimates], we’re entering a grey zone where nobody has ever gone before. We’re not promising anything — we assume that we have certain legal skills and there are some existing laws, and we hope to leverage it all,” Zheleznikov said.  He admitted there might be “years of the legal fight, refusals from the police and legal practice formation” ahead.  Notorious clientele  While not widely known in the Russian crypto space, Zheleznikov has a remarkable track record as an attorney for a number of cases making waves in Russia in recent years.  In particular, since 2014, Zheleznikov has been defending the Russian neo-Nazi Maxim Martsinkevich, nicknamed ""Tesak"" (the Hatchet), who is serving a 10-year term in Russian prison for assaulting people he and his associates believed to be drug pushers.  Zheleznikov has also defended popular Russian journalist Anton Krasovsky and oligarch Konstantin Malofeev who is believed to be a sponsor of the separatist forces that confronted the Ukrainian army on the South East of Ukraine in 2014.  Mt Gox disclosed the theft of approximately 850,000 bitcoin (worth more than $450 million at the time) in February 2014. The exchange suspended trading, filed for bankruptcy protection and began liquidation proceedings.  According to security firm WizSec, most, if not all, of the missing bitcoin were stolen from the exchange's online, or hot, wallet between 2011 and 2014.  The exchange transitioned from bankruptcy proceedings to civil rehabilitation, a debtor-friendly form of corporate restructuring, last year, meaning creditors will receive bitcoin instead of a fiat sum.  However, due to a large number of claims and other ongoing legal issues, it is unclear when these funds will be returned. A deadline for filing a civil rehabilitation plan was postponed in April by Mt Gox's trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, and no plan will be filed before the end of October.

42403287,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfT2e,1568314804,Zelle Co-Founder Takes Over Stellar Startup as Ludwin Joins Spin-Out,"Adam Ludwin is stepping down as CEO of Interstellar to head a new spin-out.  The company, which focuses on expanding the Stellar blockchain ecosystem, has named financial industry veteran Mike Kennedy its new CEO, effective Sept. 15.  Ludwin, who ran blockchain startup Chain before it merged with Lightyear.io to form Interstellar, will lead Pogo, an “app-focused company targeting interoperability between mobile wallets,” according to a press release.  His successor Kennedy co-founded Zelle, the mobile payments network owned by several large U.S. banks, and is the former president of the North American arm of global money transfer service OFX. Earlier he worked seven years at Wells Fargo in senior roles.  In a blog post, Interstellar touted Kennedy’s track record with Zelle (originally known as clearXchange), noting that JPMorgan Chase, Citi and Bank of America use the service.  “Our success [occurred] was because we were solving a real-world problem,” said Kennedy, who has been an advisor to the Stellar Development Foundation since 2017, in the post. “With Interstellar I see another opportunity to solve a real-world problem.”  International payments in particular are inefficient and expensive, he said. While the Stellar Development Foundation has built what Kennedy sees as “the best blockchain-based payments network,” there are areas that need to be improved.  “This is where Interstellar comes in,” he said, adding:  “We will deliver these missing pieces of the puzzle to allow the Stellar network to achieve its potential ... making international payments better for millions and millions of companies and end users.”  In a statement, Interstellar CTO and Stellar protocol creator Jed McCaleb said that Kennedy’s “record of success founding and growing Zelle, his innovation in mobile payments, FX and banking, and his history as a high-impact advisor to Stellar make him the perfect fit to lead Interstellar.”  Moving on  Ludwin was named CEO of Interstellar in September 2018, after the company was formed from the merger of Chain and Lightyear.  The company has been working to support the Stellar ecosystem over the past year, and Ludwin’s new role will not necessarily take him away from this mission.  Moving forward, Ludwin will oversee Pogo, which has “been in stealth development” within the Interstellar ecosystem “for some time,” Thursday’s blog post said. The spin-out will look to connect different types of mobile wallets worldwide.  According to the post, “Pogo is an example of the kind of application that Stellar is uniquely positioned to support, thanks to the network’s ability to create low-friction, high-liquidity, real-time corridors for FX settlement between financial entities.”  “I look forward to collaborating closely with [Kennedy] and the team to leverage the world class infrastructure Interstellar continues to build for the Stellar ecosystem,” Ludwin said in a statement.  Kennedy told CoinDesk that Pogo would be its own legal entity, structured as a subsidiary to Interstellar.  “Adam will be running Pogo and a number of the people he brought with him from Chain, not all of them but a number of them will be working with him [there],” he said.

42403286,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfSzh,1568307642,"CryptoKitties Creator Raises $11 Million from Warner, A16z to Launch Blockchain","Warner Music is collaborating with Dapper Labs, the company behind CryptoKitties, to create a new blockchain called Flow.  According to a story in Forbes Thursday, Dapper Labs has garnered $11 million in funding for the project, including investment from Warner. The round is led by Andreessen Horowitz, with other major venture firms like Union Square Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Venrock and Accomplice also participating.  In an email to CoinDesk, Venrock's David Pakman said Flow is aimed at a specific games use-case:  ""Ethereum and pretty much every other Layer 1 smart contracts platform [is] attempting to build scaleable networks for transactions — like payments. Decentralized gaming and things like cryptocollectibles place different scaling requirements on blockchains that sharding fundamentally doesn’t fix. So, Dapper is building Flow to allow decentralized games to scale to tens of millions of users.""  Pakman argues that the collectibles industry needs a purpose-built blockchain if major brands like Warner and the NBA are going to participate and bring their fanbases along for the ride.  Dapper Labs grew out of a $12 million venture round in 2018 that allowed it to spin out from its parent, Axiom Zen. Later that year it took in an additional $15 million in VC cash, working with many of the same funds.  Built for developers  In a technical primer shared with CoinDesk, Dapper Labs says that Flow is especially designed for ""composability"" where one developer can use code from one application in a wholly other one. It writes:  ""Flow empowers developers to safely and easily build on top of each others’ code, creating entirely new products and services at an accelerating pace. This feature of blockchain, known as composability, has the potential to unlock a new approach to software development.""  Ethereum has been slowly evolving to meet growing demands for network capacity. At the same time, other blockchains with smart contract capabilities, such as Kadena, EOS and Harmony have emerged, poised to scoop up users if Ethereum stumbles in its goal to become ""the world computer."" Flow is the latest to join that line-up, but the first that emphasizes collectibles.  Also of note, the round includes a unique structure where backers initially receive equity that can be converted to tokens later for use on the chain (pending, as ever, approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission). This is a structure similar to what venture investors know as a convertible note, where debt is swapped for equity. All being well, Dapper Labs plans to launch Flow in 2020.

The pilot transaction was made on the Hyperledger Fabric platform, a spokesperson for the bank said. It took advantage of Fabric's private collections feature, which can keep a certain set of data confidential among a subset of network participants.  The system piloted by Sberbank leverages smart contracts written in the Scala language, using the Aurelia framework and Sberbank's own cloud solution, SberCloud. It takes one second to form a block of complete transactions, the company claimed.  The deal was revealed last week during the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, by Sberbank's first deputy chairman Alexander Vedyakhin, but the size and technical details were not made public at the time.  The receivables acquired by Sberbank were owed to Trafigura by a large client from Turkey.  In his press statement, Vedyakhin said the technology helped make document flow more efficient, reducing the time needed to complete a deal ""from one day to one hour.""  ""Our blockchain pilot project records every step of the transaction: request for purchase of receivables, application processing and its approval with the bank, issuing the bank's offer, confirmation of terms by Trafigura, and settlement of the transaction,"" Vedyakhin said.  'Ongoing evolution'  The pilot showed how far blockchain tech has come and its value to businesses, Sberbank said.  ""What we see in 2019, and in this pilot in particular, is an ongoing evolution of this tech, from a promising but not yet developed technology into a more advanced and mature solution ready to live up to its initial disruptive image,"" the bank's spokesperson said, adding that Sberbank and Trafigura are considering expanding the use of blockchain in global trade finance.  A Trafigura spokesperson told CoinDesk that “the transaction flowed seamlessly between Sberbank and Trafigura,"" and the two companies are discussing how they can use the tech for other use cases.  Sberbank's blockchain lab previously used Hyperledger Fabric while investigating the opportunities of distributed ledgers: in November, the bank completed an off-exchange repurchase agreement deal with the Cyprus branch of the Russian investment company Interros.  In 2017, Sberbank launched another pilot, in which a payment involving the Russian companies MegaFon, MegaLabs and Alfa-Bank was recorded on a distributed ledger using Fabric.

""And we are on Atlantis. Congratulations, everyone,"" said hard fork coordinator Afri Schoedon during a public call, while ETC Cooperative director of developer relations Yaz Khoury said on Twitter that this fork saw ""one of the longest debates to reach consensus along with a lot of the immutability politics."" He added:  ""Learned a lot about the beauty of decentralization and a distributed community.""  Previously slated for this summer, Atlantis was postponed over disagreements, particularly over EIP 170.  No single actor coordinated the hard fork. Rather, ETC Labs worked with Chainsafe System and ETC Cooperative, among other community members, on the hard fork.  As of earlier this week, some 60 percent of nodes and over 75 percent of hashing power had confirmed the upgrade. Major exchanges Coinbase, Poloniex, Binance, Bittrex, Kraken, Shapeshift and OKEx confirmed with ETC Labs that they have updated their software to support Atlantis.  Speaking with CoinDesk, ETC Lab’s CEO Terry Culver said Atlantis signals a desire to work with ethereum. Many of Atlantis’ EIPs have been on ethereum for years and should allow for more crossover between the platforms, especially for dapps.  “The hard fork clearly shows we are committed to compatibly and working with ethereum,” Culver said. “What we would like to do is find ways to make the two chains support one another.”  Ethereum is 2016 hard fork of ethereum classic following The DAO, a hacked funding mechanism causing a rift in the cryptocurrencies community. The projects remain separate, Culver told CoinDesk, but they still share many of the same goals.  While the hard fork was postponed, the process wasn't contentious, Culver said, adding:  ""We believe in the strength of the public blockchain. It's really built on the strength for the community.""  In the hours leading up to the hard fork, Digital Currency Group founder and CEO Barry Silbert dropped into a public Discord group for the ethereum classic community, joking that he was ""looking forward to getting [his] Ethereum Classic Atlantis coins.""

In the filing, dated Sept. 10, Hong Kong-listed electronics manufacturer Pantronics Holdings Limited, acquired by Huobi last August, disclosed it will change its name to Huobi Technology Holdings Limited.  The company transferred more than 221 million ordinary shares to Huobi Group at its acquisition, according to shareholding disclosures. The $77 million deal made the cryptocurrency exchange the majority shareholder in Pantronics, with an over 73 percent stake in the company.  The deal was reported at the time as potentially providing Huobi the opportunity to go public in Hong Kong via a process known as a reverse takeover.  However, the move could be affected by the stricter regulations (pdf) on backdoor IPOs from HKEX planned for Oct. 1. The stock exchange said it would make changes to its current regulations, making such transactions more difficult for those that acquire another publicly listed company in different industries based in Hong Kong.  Other major companies in the cryptocurrency space are also seeking to go public in different jurisdictions, after stalled attempts in Hong Kong.

42403290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfT5b,1568293241,Staked Automates the Best DeFi Returns With Launch of Robo Advisor,"Investors in decentralized finance (DeFi) have a new way to generate the best possible returns.  Staked's new Robo Advisor for Yield (RAY) service, which launches today, automates the process of finding high-yielding opportunities. Normally, investors have had to watch constantly and reallocate quickly to catch an enhanced DeFi return. Now they can set a smart contract to do the monitoring and allocating for them.    ""This product is targeted to people who hold eth or dai and want to earn yield on it,"" CEO Tim Ogilvie told CoinDesk in an interview. ""If you hold ETH, you can earn more ETH. If you hold DAI, you can earn more DAI.""    Staked  already helps investors place funds with various proof-of-stake protocols (blockchains that reward users for locking up their coins for periods of time, such as Tezos, Decred and Dash). The New York startup announced a seed round in January backed by Pantera, Coinbase, Winkelvoss Capital and others.  With RAY, investors can put their assets (ETH, USDC or DAI) into an asset-specific pool and the smart contract will automatically invest all or part of that pool into contracts with the best yield at any given time. For now, it will invest only on the money market Compound and with the derivatives protocols DYDX and BZX. But Staked is vetting additional smart contracts for safety and reliability.  An example of how RAY works: Imagine an investment pool has one million dollars worth of ETH in it and Compound is offering 5 percent. But then DYDX starts offering 7 percent for collateral on ETH-based derivatives. RAY would move as much of its collateral as DYDX had space for, and the entire pool would share in the extra return.  ""We're not necessarily saying we are going to beat the market. We're just saying you'll get the best of what a savvy watcher would get in the market,"" Ogilvie said.  ""The vision we are building toward is the same level of sophistication the fixed income markets have in traditional finance,"" he added.  Staked smart contract store  Staked is building a pool of liquidity that will automatically move to where there's opportunity. Right now, every investor has to decide which DeFi app to put their assets in, which means that entrepreneurs need to get enough people's attention to get that collateral. With Staked, there is a pool of capital ready to move automatically if an application shows attractive returns.  Tom Bean, CEO of BZX, a derivatives protocol that lets users long and short different crypto assets, told CoinDesk he was ""excited"" about a new pool to tap into.  ""We put a lot of emphasis on integrations, because once we've plugged in, that's easy liquidity,"" he said. As a newer company that isn't venture backed, it hasn't been able to attract capital as easily as some others. The Staked pool could remove this pain point for BZX and any other new smart contract that gets whitelisted, Bean said.  On a day-to-day basis, the returns for providing capital to any smart contracts tends to be fairly uniform, meaning the market is generally efficient, as both Ogilvie and Bean noticed. But Ogilvie noted that it's still new enough that returns on one smart contract spike over the others from time to time, and a vigilant investor can do well by catching those upticks. The point of RAY is to take advantage.  To encourage participation, Staked is set up so RAY makes a return only if it beats a baseline.  ""We take a benchmark rate of Compound, and we'll take a percentage of anything we can make above that,"" Ogilvie explained. RAY makes 20 percent returns above whatever the funds would have made if they were all just in Compound.  The tech behind RAY  Proving at long last that non-fungible tokens (NFT) aren't just for games, RAY will rely on the same ERC-721 standard the runs CryptoKitties. Instead of proving ownership of a procedurally generated cartoon, it will authenticate rights to part of a financial product.  When users put assets in RAY, they will get an NFT that indicates how much they put in and when. That token will be redeemable for the assets and whatever returns they made, whenever the user is ready to take it out.  ""Everything we do is non-custodial,"" Ogilvie said. The token goes into a smart contract, not into RAY, and the assets can only be transferred back to the wallet where they originated from.  ""It pools everyone together and you get the benefit of scale,"" he said.  Ogilvie sees RAY as just the beginning of an ever increasing set of decentralized finance (DeFi) products. It's easy for him to imagine a future where ever bigger robo advisors serve specific tranches of investment clients.  ""You can just allocate it optimally, subject to your risk preferences. You shouldn't have someone like a Goldman Sachs creating a giant haircut on it,"" Ogilvie told CoinDesk. He noted:  ""All of these things benefit from scale and the thing that's cool about DeFi, and that scale is embodied in a smart contract that is open source. It's always getting better, and it's accessible to everybody.""

42403281,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfSum,1568287806,Kakao's Klay Cryptocurrency to Make First Exchange Listing,"South Korean messaging giant Kakao's ""klay"" token – the native cryptocurrency of its recently launched Klaytn blockchain – is soon to make its first official exchange listing on Upbit's platform.  Ground X, the firm set up by Kakao to develop the Klaytn network, announced the news in a Medium post on Sept. 5, saying klay will list on Upbit's Singapore and Indonesia platforms by the end of this month.  Upbit Singapore revealed on Sept. 6 that klay will be listed following price discovery via a Dutch auction – in which the price is reduced until buyers are found – on Sept. 18.  The auction will run for 12 hours, or until a yet-to-be-determined hard cap is hit. Subsequently, successful bidders will receive their klays on Sept. 19. A klay/bitcoin trading pair will be enabled at a future date.  The exchange added that Upbit and Klaytn won't profit from the auction and Upbit will ""redistribute all proceeds"" to users in the future.  Kakao has not responded to questions from CoinDesk regarding how it plans to redistribute the proceeds and how much klay cryptocurrency it will make available for the auction. The exchange did say a total of 10 billion klay will be distributed through to 2021 in monthly tranches ranging from 29 million to 278 million tokens.  The news that Upbit is the first platform to list Klay is perhaps not surprising given the close association of the two entities. Headquartered in South Korea, Upbit is a crypto exchange operated by Dunamu, a firm backed by Kakao.  In its announcement, Upbit said that in a private sale in December 2018, Klay was priced at $0.03 per unit. Later, in April 2019, a private sale saw the cryptocurrency reach $0.08 apiece. Ground X reportedly raised $90 million in a private coin offering this spring.  It may seem unexpected that klay is launching in Singapore and Indonesia first, and not in the home nation of both Upbit and kakao. However, the listing announcement follows press reports suggesting that klay would have trouble listing in South Korea, where initial coin offerings are forbidden.

42403297,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfTCU,1568286056,History Favors the Bulls as Bitcoin Price Trades Sideways at $10K,"View  Bitcoin's long-term bullish bias remains intact, with prices holding well above the historically strong support of the three-day chart's 55-candle exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $8,972. The line served as a strong base in the 2016–2017 bull market.  A bullish falling-wedge breakout on the 4-hour chart looks likely and could pave the way for a retest of recent highs above $10,900.  The prospects of a breakout would weaken if prices find acceptance below Wednesday's low of $9,855 on the back of a rise in selling volumes. That would expose support at $9,320 (Aug. 29 low).      Bitcoin's (BTC) price rally has stalled in the last 10 weeks, but the bullish case remains intact with prices hovering well above a historically strong price support.  The leading cryptocurrency broke into the latest bull market on April 2 with a high-volume rise from $4,000 to $5,000. It subsequently went on to hit a 17-month high of $13,880 on Bitstamp on June 26.  Since then, however, the cryptocurrency has charted a narrowing price range with lower highs above $12,000 and higher lows below $10,000, as seen in the chart below.  The consolidation is reminiscent of a contracting triangle near $6,000 seen in the August to October period last year. That narrowing price range had ended with a downside break in November.  The latest consolidation, therefore, may force investors to question the validity of the bullish breakout confirmed in April.  However, it is too early to call an end of the bull market and the risks will remain skewed to the upside as long as the cryptocurrency is defending the three-day chart's 55-candle exponential moving average.  That EMA line served as a strong base during the 2016–2017 bull run. As of writing, the EMA is located at $8,972, while at press time BTC is changing hands at $10,145 on Bitstamp, representing a nearly 1 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  3-day chart  At the end of October 2015, bitcoin's outlook turned bullish with prices rising above $300. The cryptocurrency then formed a series of higher lows and higher highs to hit a record high of $20,000 in December 2017.  Notably, the higher lows (marked by arrows) were established along the ascending (bullish) 55-candle EMA and almost every bounce ended up setting a higher high.  For instance, bitcoin's pullback from the June 2016 high above $770 ran out of steam below the 55-candle EMA at $542 in August 2016 following which prices rallied to $1,100 by January 2017.  On similar lines, pullbacks to the 55-candle EMA in April 2016 and March, July, and September 2017 fueled stronger rallies. Not once were sellers strong enough to force a convincing close below the 55-candle EMA.  Hence, the bullish case put forward by 2019's second-quarter price rise is likely to weaken only if and when the three-candle finds acceptance under the 55-candle EMA, currently at $8,972.  In fact, any pullback to the crucial average will be the biggest test for the bulls. A strong bounce from that level will likely cement expectations of a rally to fresh record highs above $20,000.  As for the next 24 hours, the odds appear stacked in favor of a move higher for BTC.  4-hour chart  BTC is trapped in a falling-wedge pattern, a bullish continuation setup, as discussed yesterday. Trading volumes have dropped throughout the pullback from $10,949 to $9,855 (Tuesday's low).  So, the probability of BTC witnessing a wedge breakout is high – more so, as the widely-tracking trend-following moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram has crossed above zero, confirming a bullish reversal.  The Chaikin money flow index, which incorporates both prices and trading volumes, is also reporting a bullish divergence – higher lows contradicting lower lows on price.  A wedge breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors for a retest of recent highs above $10,900.  The bullish case would weaken if prices drop below Wednesday's low of $9,855 with a solid rise in selling volumes.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42403284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfSyi,1568280922,France Says It Will Block Facebook Libra in Europe,"Updated with a statement from the Libra Association (Sept. 13, 07:05 UTC).      The French finance minister has said the nation plans to block Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency in the EU over concerns that it poses a threat to the sovereignty of national currencies.  According to The Independent newspaper on Thursday, Bruno Le Maire, Economy and Finance Minister of France, said:  ""I want to be absolutely clear: In these conditions, we cannot authorize the development of Libra on European soil.""  Le Maire was speaking at the opening of an OECD conference on blockchain and cryptocurrencies in Paris, France.  The Telegraph  , meanwhile, adds that Le Maire said ""It would be a global currency, held by a single player, which has more than two billion users around the world. The monetary sovereignty of states is under states is under threat.""  Le Maire reportedly expressed concerns that Libra may ""substitute itself as a national currency"" and potentially cause financial disruption.  ""I don't see why we should dedicate so much effort to combating money laundering and terrorist financing for so many years to see a digital currency like Libra completely escape those regulatory efforts,"" he said.  The Libra Association told CoinDesk:  ""The comments today from France's economy and finance minister further underscore the importance of our ongoing work with regulatory bodies and leadership around the world. In the nearly three months since the intent to launch the Libra project was announced, we have become the world's most scrutinized fintech effort. We welcome this scrutiny and have deliberately designed a long launch runway to have these conversations, educate stakeholders and incorporate their feedback in our design. The Libra Association and its members are committed to working with regulatory authorities to achieve a safe, transparent, and consumer-focused implementation of the Libra project. We recognize that blockchain is an emerging technology, and that policymakers must carefully consider how its applications fit into their financial system policies.""  A CNBC report indicated that Le Maire also said today that he's discussed the creation of a “public digital currency” with outgoing European Central Bank president Mario Draghi and Christine Lagarde, who will take over his position later this year.  CoinDesk has reached out to the Libra Association for comment and will update this breaking story if more information is received.

42403288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfT1f,1568279717,Facebook Libra Brings 'Risks and Opportunities': Swiss Watchdog Chief,"The head of the Swiss financial markets watchdog has spoken out on the perceived pressure for the nation arising from Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency project being based in Geneva, as well as the potential opportunities cryptocurrency tech brings.  In an interview with the Neue Zuercher Zeitung newspaper, Mark Branson, director of the Financial Market Authority (FINMA), said that while Libra may be viewed as somewhat controversial internationally, it's not his agency's role to ""facilitate"" the project. Instead, ""We have to explain and apply the existing rules,"" he said.  However, Branson also said that if Switzerland wants to become a major financial center, it will have to live with the potential risks of working with such major projects as Libra.  He told the paper:  ""High finance can bring reputational risks. This is true everywhere in the world. But I have a hard time thinking that Switzerland should become a second-rate financial center just to avoid such risks. The decisive factor is whether Switzerland has credible regulation and supervision as well as appropriate framework conditions for large players.""  While regulators worldwide having expressed concerns over the financial risks of the Facebook-led project, Branson said FINMA wasn't under pressure to apply tough rules to Libra. ""Libra has big ambitions,"" he said. ""We did not need foreign pressure to recognize this."" He added that Libra's 28 members include ""successful and huge corporations.""  In recent weeks, lawmakers from the U.S. have been travelling to Switzerland to hold talks over Libra and its potential regulation.  Noted Libra critic, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), who heads the House Financial Services Committee, recently said she still had doubts over the cryptocurrency project after discussions with Swiss regulators. Waters said she had concerns over “allowing a large tech company to create a privately controlled, alternative global currency,” although the meetings were “helpful in understanding the status, complexity and magnitude of Facebook’s plans.""  The FINMA chief said in the interview that a global project like Libra can only be addressed through coordination with international regulators. It would be ""illusory"" to think that just one country can carry out the task, he added.  Addressing the concerns that Libra and other cryptocurrencies can act as a conduit for money launderers, Branson accepted that the technology poses a ""challenge,"" and said FINMA intends to regulate the crypto industry in the same way it regulates traditional finance.  However, he continued, while there are risks with cryptocurrencies, there are also potential ""benefits,"" and they could in fact help to tackle money laundering. ""For example, if traceability of transactions becomes fully available. So there are risks and opportunities,"" he said.  With the news yesterday that Libra has sought an assessment from FINMA in preparation for registration as a payments system in Switzerland, Neue Zuercher Zeitung asked Branson if the license would be sufficient to cover the wide ambitions of Libra.  The regulator responded that the license is necessary, but that if Libra provides other ""risk-enhancing services,"" FINMA will place additional requirements. He provided the example of Libra's reserve, which will include a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds. This would present risks over and above straightforward payments, which ""would have to be met with corresponding requirements, according to the principle of 'same risks, same rules'.""  For its part, the Libra Association addressed the concerns over money laundering risks in a statement provided to CoinDesk on Wednesday.  It said:  “The Libra Association will maintain AML guidelines, which its members will be expected to comply with if they choose to provide financial services on the Libra network. The association will set standards for its members to maintain AML and anti-fraud programs, and to cooperate with legitimate law enforcement investigations. It will be the responsibility of developers building on the Libra Blockchain to comply with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate.”  Mark Branson image via FINMA",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/12/facebook-libra-brings-risks-and-opportunities-swiss-watchdog-chief,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/00abc7c246f849c3d240bbd55b58728d0f095aee-1500x877.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This is not the first stablecoin to be created by Binance and listed on the cryptocurrency exchange. In July, the Jersey arm of Binance enabled trading for its own British pound-backed stablecoin called Binance GBP (BGBP).

42403294,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfT8Y,1568272823,PwC Report Shows Major Growth in Crypto M&A in Asia and Europe,"A majority of fundraising and M&A deals in the cryptocurrency industry are now happening in Asia and Europe, surpassing the previously dominant role of the Americas, according to a new report from PwC.  Released on Thursday at CoinDesk's Invest: Asia event, the professional service firm's analysis of the crypto ecosystem found that 41 percent of global fundraising deals in Q2 2019 took place in Europe. Europe saw 34 percent of global fundraising deals in the same period last year.  Similarly, cryptocurrency fundraises in the Asian market have jumped significantly, accounting for 26 percent of the deals in Q2 2019.  Combined, the two regions accounted for 67 percent of the action in Q2 2019.  Meanwhile, the report identifies a significant drop in crypto fundraising deals in the Americas.  While the region accounted for 51 percent of global deals in Q2 2018, the Americas captured just 28 percent in Q2 2019.  Globally, however, the total number of fundraising deals, as well as the amount of capital involved, have both declined by more than 50 percent from as high as $408 million in Q1 2018.  That said, given bitcoin's recent price rebound, the report indicates there has been an uptick in the value of global deals, which has grown to $250 million in Q2 2019 from $166 million in Q1.  Speaking to this trend, Lucy Gazmararian, senior manager of PwC's fintech and crypto team, said at Invest: Asia:  ""The price of bitcoin is the bellwether for the industry and for the sentiment of investors. As the price of bitcoin has recovered, we see the sentiment has become more positive and have seen more activities in fundraising and M&A activities.""  The PwC report added that the firm has observed a similar trend in the mergers-and-acquisitions realm, for which the dominance of the U.S. market has decreased from over 80 percent in the first half of 2018 to 48 percent in Q2 2019.  Meanwhile, the combination of M&A deals that happened in Asia and Europe jumped from just 17 percent in early 2018 to over 50 percent now.  Elsewhere in the report, the firm observed a significant decline of M&A deals in the cryptocurrency mining sector since the start of 2018 while investment interest has shifted more towards blockchain infrastructure development. Gazmararian added:  ""Since the first half of 2018, we have seen the investment in the mining sector has been consolidating while healthy activity remain in blockchain, exchanges and trading infrastructure.""  In a statement, PwC FinTech & Crypto Leader for Asia Henri Arslanian echoed that sentiment.  ""Except perhaps for crypto mining, we are seeing capital flow to every sector of the crypto industry,"" Arslanian said, ""in particular, crypto exchanges as well as broader crypto trading and blockchain infrastructure companies.""

42403270,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfR6c,1568271640,Santander Settles Both Sides of a $20 Million Bond Trade on Ethereum,"Spanish banking giant Santander says it has become the first institution to use a public blockchain to manage all aspects of a bond issue.  Revealed Thursday, the company not only used a token on ethereum to represent the $20 million debt issuance but settled it with another set of ERC-20 tokens representing cash held in a custody account.  To understand why that’s important, imagine asking someone a question on WhatsApp and waiting for them to mail a postcard with the answer. That’s what it's like to issue securities on a blockchain while settling the cash side of the trade through the analog legacy system. But Santander, in this analogy, conducted both parts of the conversation digitally.  Previously, the World Bank issued a similar blockchain bond but used a private version of ethereum. French lender Societe Generale issued a bond earlier this year on the public ethereum network but said nothing about cash on-ledger.  Santander is claiming bragging rights since every part of its process is digitized, automated and on-chain, including having Santander Security Services custody the cryptographic keys for the tokenized security and tokenized cash.  However, like SocGen, Santander issued the blockchain bond to itself, meaning no outside investors were involved.  “It’s an evolutionary step,"" John Whelan, head of digital investment banking at Santander’s corporate and investment bank, told CoinDesk. ""There are no secondary markets yet, but we are on that path,”  Plain vanilla  Describing the project as a “real-money pilot,” Antonio Torío, head of funding at Santander, said the transaction was a plain-vanilla bond with a one-year maturity, four quarterly coupons and a standard rate of 1.98 percent.  “For Santander, this is really much more of a technology innovation issue than a pure financial issue. We regard this an important first step that will be followed by more complex transactions,” Torio said.  Whelan said the tokenized cash was held “in escrow in a smart contract on the public ethereum blockchain, until the issuer had underwritten the transaction and instructed the blockchain to perform the delivery versus payment,” at which point the cash and bonds were swapped “simultaneously and irrevocably.” The process started Friday and wrapped up Tuesday.  Asked if Sandander’s custody services could equally hold fully-fledged digital assets such as bitcoin and ether, Whelan said this was technically possible but not the bank’s plan, adding:  “At the bank, we are not interested in cryptocurrencies directly. The technology is the same underneath, but we are interested and our customers are interested in traditional dollars, euros, pounds and that's our space.”  Nivaura’s role  Santander relied on London-based technology provider Nivaura (which the bank has invested in) to assist with the digitalization of the issuance.  Nivaura CEO Avtar Sehra pointed out that creating a blockchain bond is not difficult; essentially all you are doing is creating a notarized form of information using a smart contract.  “This is not really digitizing a bond,"" he said. ""All you are really doing is digitizing the process for registration and settlement – and even for the settlement part you are only addressing half the problem because you haven’t got cash on the blockchain.”  Nivaura allows all documentation and negotiation around issuance to be digitized in such a way that data can be encrypted so each party can only see certain fields in the document, as opposed to emailing pdfs around and such like.  “That’s the key significance of what Santander is doing here,” said Sehra. “They are saying ‘let’s digitize the entire process’. We are not now doing the bond construction in the old fashioned way, inputting data manually in an insecure fashion into a blockchain to tokenize it and doing the same with cash. That’s absurd.”  ""The Santander execution is the first truly digital front to back execution process, which securely uses relevant data to tokenize both the assets and cash to enable on-chain settlement and coupon payments,"" Sehra added.  Vote of confidence?  One conclusion that can be drawn from Santander’s efforts and others doing similar things is that the banking world is slowly but surely coming around to trust ethereum.  This is perhaps not so surprising given it is almost five years since the second-largest blockchain switched on its mainnet.  Whelan pointed out that bitcoin and ethereum have the unique characteristic of having had 100 percent uptime since launch (in this regard, unlike any other computing system on the planet he could think of).  He concluded:  “I think it's becoming apparent that ethereum is just part of the internet.”  Santander image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/12/santander-settles-both-sides-of-a-20-million-bond-trade-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96c8fefe2c1a87cbfc96300a72d385ec8993d626-2340x1398.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403277,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfRDV,1568256955,"Bobby Lee Returns With Ballet, a Crypto Hardware Wallet for the Masses","More than a year after he sold one of China's longest-running bitcoin exchanges, Bobby Lee, co-founder and former CEO of BTCC, is back.  Announced Thursday at CoinDesk's Invest: Asia event in Singapore, Lee's new venture, Ballet, is rolling out a hardware wallet supporting multiple cryptocurrencies.  To differentiate its product and spur adoption outside crypto circles, Ballet will generate public addresses and private keys for users in advance.  Lee believes this design will make it easier for people who have no exposure to crypto to get hands-on experience with the asset without having to go through the set-up process most hardware wallets require.  “We wanted to create a wallet that is simple and elegant. And that is what we’ve done,” Lee said on stage Thursday.  Handheld  The wallet, also dubbed Ballet, is a piece of metal the size of a credit card that prints a QR code associated with the cryptocurrency wallet address set up by Lee's firm.  On each wallet, beneath the QR code, there is a string of printed encryption code. At the bottom of the card, there's another string of encryption code that's coated, which a user must scratch off in order to see.  Only the combination of the two through Ballet's iOS and Android app, also launched Thursday, will allow the user to see the private key, which will be the same key to access all cryptos on different blockchains that Ballet supports.  “I’ve been working on this hard since January of this year,"" Lee said during his presentation. ""We’ve gone through six iterations of this hardware wallet design.”  Currently, the firm's product supports native cryptocurrencies on the bitcoin, litecoin, XRP, and ethereum networks as well as tokens that have been issued on specific blockchains such as all ERC-20 tokens.  Low price  To further the goal of fostering mass adoption, Lee said the pre-order price of Ballet will be $29, less than what existing hardware wallets with more advanced cold storage security measures cost. The company now eyes October for shipment after taking in pre-orders.  In a fireside chat at Thursday's event, Lee said the project started in late December and has raised an undisclosed amount of capital in a seed round backed by Ribbit Capital, a venture capital firm that has invested in crypto exchange Coinbase. Lee said Ballet has 20 staffers worldwide with a global headquarters in Las Vegas.  The company does the pre-setup for each wallet being sold to generate blockchain addresses and the associated private keys, but Lee said the firm deletes the data after production.  ""We generated the keys for you in two locations thousands of miles apart,"" he said. ""[After that] we manufacture ourselves out of the process.""  Lee is mostly known in the crypto industry for running BTCC, one of the earliest crypto exchanges in China. He joined BTCC in 2013 as a co-founder and CEO, two years after the exchange was launched by Yang Linke, and helped the firm secure a $5 million Series A funding round backed by VC giant Lightspeed.  In January 2018, BTCC was sold to an unnamed blockchain investment fund based in Hong Kong, just months after China's central bank issued a ban on initial coin offerings (ICOs) as well as fiat-to-crypto trading.

42403275,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfRCW,1568249236,Why the Marshall Islands Is Doing a Pre-Sale for Its National Cryptocurrency,"A small island country in the Pacific has plans to launch its own government-issued cryptocurrency called the Marshallese sovereign (SOV). It was revealed Wednesday at CoinDesk's Invest: Asia event that the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) would be introducing the SOV through a forthcoming token pre-sale.  Called the Timed Release Monetary Issuance (TRMI), RMI minister David Paul explained that anyone (regardless of location) can register for the pre-sale on the newly launched website of the SOV Development Foundation. Paul stressed that the actual pre-sale for SOV – in which users buy TRMI units that can later be exchanged one-for-one with SOV units – is not yet live and is still ""a work in progress.""  But once launched, Paul estimated it would be 18 to 24 months, or even less, before the real SOV is made available to the public.  ""It could be well-vetted enough right before the TRMI that we don’t need the full 18 to 24 months,"" Paul said. ""You probably only need six months if all the preparation is done beforehand.""  One of the primary reason for doing this pre-sale, according to Paul, is to get a sense of the levels of liquidity and market interest in the SOV cryptocurrency.  Paul said:  ""TRMI is really another way of doing an [initial coin offering] but in a more responsible and methodical manner. That's really the TRMI. You have to look at how to establish liquidity. When you do TRMI, you're looking at the appetite for the product and how it's going to [behave] in the markets.""  This is a doubly important concern for government officials in the Marshall Islands given that the launch leaves no room for failure.  ""For us, it's really the reputation and integrity of a country on the line. We've got one shot at this,"" said Paul.  Regulatory concerns  Apart from gauging market interest, Paul and his team at the non-profit SOV Development Foundation are also focused on addressing regulatory concerns surrounding the SOV raised by other countries and international organizations.  Last September  , the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised against the SOV project saying that the introduction of a cryptocurrency as legal tender in the country could ""increase macroeconomic and financial integrity risks.""  Even the U.S. Treasury had told the RMI government ""point-blank,"" according to Paul, that it didn't like the SOV. However, following nearly a year of internal discussions, Paul affirmed that U.S. officials are saying this project could work.  Getting the regulators on board is a key prerequisite to launching the TRMI, Paul said, adding:  ""A nation cannot rebrand [like a company can]. That’s why we have to do this in such a way that’s different. It has to be transparent. It has to be inclusive. We need to make sure that we work with regulators to ensure that once we launch, they don’t go back and say, 'Oh, you haven't done this. You should have done that.'""
