Sentiment suggests Crypto is dead once again, and the Winter has begun. The Crypto Industry has never experienced significant monetary tightening. Altcoins should continue to underperform Bitcoin. The liquidity cycle will turn up eventually. Dollar-Cost-Averaging into the safest Crypto Asset should be the way to go in 2023. Bitcoin fulfills its purpose Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is a hedge against monetary debasement – not consumer price inflation. Bitcoin started the last bull run in March 2020, when the Federal Reserve announced unlimited Quantitative Easing and Fed Funds were lowered to zero in reaction to the Covid crisis. The resulting easing of financial conditions occurred mainly in 2021 because monetary policy acts with long and variable lags. It is not a coincidence that the broad market and especially interest rate-sensitive tech stocks rallied alongside Crypto. The tremendous easing of monetary policy created another asset bubble because of monetary debasement. Crypto offers the highest beta, so the price of Bitcoin rose tenfold, and many other smaller Cryptocurrencies outperformed massively. Additionally, the unparalleled distribution of the printed money by the fiscal authorities, in combination with supply constraints, resulted in spiking consumer price inflation. The narrative that Bitcoin is an inflation hedge is misleading, or at least not accurate enough. Bitcoin is a hedge against monetary debasement, just like Gold or, in part, any other asset. Bitcoin simply has the highest beta, and therefore the price reaction of Bitcoin looks like a typical bubble on a linear chart. These bubbles are reoccurring, however, because the Central Banks of the world have continuous Zugzwang to finance the enormous debt loads of their governments and economies. Bitcoin profits each time monetary policy is expected to ease, and it usually crashes when monetary policy or financial conditions are expected to tighten. Now, Bitcoin is down ~75 % from peak to trough from the All-time highs of November 2021. At the same time Bitcoin peaked, the Federal Reserve announced that they believe inflation isn’t transitory anymore. This resulted in a fast and aggressive tightening cycle, and the market started discounting the outstanding tightening cycle when Bitcoin and the average of all assets reached their peak in late 2021. Rising rates, Quantitative Tightening, and a strong Dollar ( DXY ) ended the last bull run, the same way falling rates, Quantitative Easing, and a weak Dollar started it. Bitcoin is not money. Bitcoin is not a currency. Bitcoin is not scalable. Bitcoin is not the Crypto Industry with all its useless financial schemes and stupid leverage. Bitcoin is a decentralized monetary debasement hedge. An opportunity to leave the vicious cycle that is the long-term debasement of the currency without the possibility of government interventions (e.g. Gold in 1933 under Roosevelt). It is no coincidence that Bitcoin appeared just after the global financial crisis, when the monetary debasement circus started getting out of hand. Bitcoin fulfilled its purpose of hedging the risks that result from monetary debasement. The tremendous drawdown during 2022 is a feature, not a bug. The liquidity cycle will turn at some point. The world isn’t linear. Let’s hope for intense boredom in 2023 The bull case for Bitcoin and, therefore, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and, by in large, the whole Crypto Industry is a boring 2023 without any significant and sustainable price movements. As I have expressed in many of my previous articles , I believe that the Federal Reserve won’t just do a 180 on their monetary policy stance the moment inflationary pressures ease. They will likely keep short-end rates high until the economy enters a proper recession, where unemployment rises and demand falls. The focus is on the economy now – not on the Central Bank policy changes. There is no significant catalyst for new all-time highs in 2023 unless the Central Banks start easing aggressively again. I believe a sideways chop would be a good setup for 2024 and 2025 when the next halving takes place. Eventually, the monetary easing will return. Over the long run, debt loads have to be eroded, and austerity is too painful for the masses and politicians to be a real solution. The obvious choice is financial oppression by keeping real rates in negative territory over the long term. There are periods of financial tightening, but they can't last forever. During 2022 we had the most aggressive tightening of monetary policy for 40+ years. In 2023 the rate of change of the tightening will decrease, or towards the later stages, even reverse. But I still believe the chances for a right tail risk event for Bitcoin remain small. On the contrary, another leg down for Crypto seems likely. If the economic downturn leads to higher unemployment, then a risk-off environment could hurt Bitcoin, as market participants rush to purchase Dollars and reduce risk. Another leg down for stocks at the current prices is my base case. Given how low Bitcoin has fallen already, I think that Dollar-Cost-Averaging throughout the year 2023 will sow the seeds for harvesting season in two to three years. In the end, nobody knows where exactly the bottom is. In my personal portfolio , I sold all of my Crypto Assets in early April 2021, except for some Bitcoin which I still hold for the long term in cold storage: Bitcoin Purchases & Sales of Author (tradingview.com) Two weeks ago, I started accumulating Bitcoin again. I plan to purchase every month, with a total allocation goal of 15-17% of my portfolio, on the 31st of December 2023. During the first half of the year, I’ll limit my purchases to Bitcoin because of the recent Crypto Industry turmoil. Let me be clear: I don’t believe the bottom is in for Bitcoin, but I believe Dollar-Cost-Averaging during 2023 prices will yield a significant return 2 or 3 years down the road. I believe the current rally only represents a short-term squeeze. The macroeconomic conditions are likely to stay the same in 2023 and continue to weigh on asset prices. Significant risks remain because Bitcoin has never experienced such a fast and aggressive tightening cycle. Therefore the drawdown could be much more extended than I currently expect and what history suggests. After all, Bitcoin is only 14 years old. The current drawdown doesn’t stand out in any particular way compared to other cycles of Bitcoin, contrary to what the macroeconomic conditions could indicate: Sum of Realized Profit and Loss (insights.glassnode.com) Profit and Loss by Return Bands (insights.glassnode.com) MVRV Z-Score (lookintobitcoin.com) The silent Altcoin underperformance Usually, during a downturn of the Crypto market the safest assets outperform. The Bitcoin dominance (market cap of Bitcoin / market cap of Crypto Assets) usually rises in a bear market because of the increased downside of smaller, riskier, and more centralized projects. However, during 2022 it seemed like the Bitcoin dominance didn’t increase, even though prices fell. Some argued that the use cases of Defi were the reason for the lack of Bitcoin dominance. However, if we erase the biggest Stablecoins from the equation, which act as cash allocation without leaving the blockchain space, the Bitcoin dominance looks like this: Bitcoin dominance ex Stablecoins (tradingview.com) Although the dominance slowly increased to ~50 % (ex stablecoins), I believe that there is still ~10–15 % upside left, compared to the 2021 high of ~70 %. Meaning, Altcoins remain expensive relative to the price of Bitcoin. Indeed, some of the larger Altcoins (e.g. ETH-USD, BNB-USD , MATIC-USD ) almost managed to outperform Bitcoin during 2022. The contagion risks for the Crypto Industry still pose a threat after the Luna-Terra failure initiated a collateral crash, and several Crypto Lenders, Miners, and Exchanges went bankrupt. Only a few people know about the liquidity levels of the currently operating businesses. Most of the time, it’s a black hole (e.g. Binance). Time will tell if there is another shoe to drop. Therefore, I limit my Crypto allocation during the first half of 2023 solely to Bitcoin, as it is the most reliable and decentralized Crypto Asset, and Altcoins remain relatively expensive on average. There might be an argument for limiting the purchases to Bitcoin and Ethereum though. Only later in the liquidity cycle, I might add additional risk via a small allocation in Altcoins. I think projects in the Layer 2 and Layer 0 space are particularly interesting in that regard. But that’s a conversation for tomorrow. The Bear Case: No Boredom If the year 2023 doesn’t get boring for the Crypto space, it’s likely because of bad news pushing prices and sentiment even lower. There are many possibilities: The Greyscale Bitcoin Trust ( BTC )"" target=""_blank"">GBTC ) currently trades at a discount to Net-Asset-Value of 36 %. There are rumors about the closed-end fund potentially being liquidated because of its ties to Genesis. Genesis is a Crypto Lender which came under pressure because of the recent FTX scandal. Genesis was a financial backer of Greyscale, and both companies had the same parent company: Digital Currency Group. If the Trust gets liquidated 634.000 Bitcoin with a 36 % discount would be thrown into the market. For a comparison: As a result of the Luna-Terra fiasco, only 80.000 Bitcoin were liquidated. During the panic, the price of Bitcoin halved from $40.000 to $20.000. Additionally, there is the possibility of another bankruptcy of a large financial player in the Crypto Industry. Terra-Luna happened in May 2022, and it was one of the key reasons how FTX got in trouble. However, the bankruptcy of FTX didn’t happen until November 2022. There’s absolutely no reason to assume that the contagion has already wiped out all of the overleveraged financial players. Only after a sustained period of time without any incidents we can be somewhat sure that the deleveraging is finished. Furthermore, Bitcoin and the Crypto industry have never experienced an aggressive and prolonged tightening cycle. Therefore I would be cautious to assume that this cycle will play out just as the last three. As of now though, there are no distinct differences in this cycle in comparison to the last ones – at least in terms of on-chain data and price action. But nobody knows how a prolonged tightening cycle will affect an asset that has never experienced such tight monetary conditions. Key Takeaways Bitcoin is a decentralized monetary debasement hedge, not an inflation hedge. It fulfilled its purpose of hedging the risks that resulted from monetary debasement in the past. Eventually, monetary easing will return. Over the long run, debt loads have to be eroded, and austerity is too painful for the masses and politicians to be a real solution. The obvious choice is financial oppression by keeping real rates in negative territory over the long term. There are periods of financial tightening, but they can't last forever. Bitcoin will profit from the start of the next liquidity cycle. Nobody can time the bottom. Therefore I believe Dollar-Cost-Averaging throughout the year 2023 should result in a good entry price with a two to three year time horizon. That’s at least what I will be doing. There are plenty of possible catalysts that could result in much lower prices because of an incredibly overleveraged Crypto Industry and continuing macroeconomic headwinds. For these reasons I view the current pump as short-winded. A sustained period of boredom should be very bullish for Bitcoin in the long run.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570454-bitcoin-boredom-is-bullish-in-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7699020.jpeg

42414669,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD6Q5,1673997466,French Crypto Companies Must Seek Authorization by 2024 Under New Lawmaker Plans,"Crypto companies in France would have to seek authorization from regulators to operate if they are not already registered with the country’s financial regulator by Jan. 1, 2024, under plans adopted by lawmakers at the National Assembly on Tuesday.  The plans offer more leeway than the Senate, which proposed in December to offer a cutoff date of October 2023, in a bid to stop crypto companies abusing new European Union rules known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.  “I propose to take the date of January 1, 2024, to let new entrants have a little more time to ask for their authorization, which is complicated,” as well as offering more time to the Financial Markets Authority to process applications, said Daniel Labaronne, who is holding the pen on the new legislation on behalf of the Assembly’s Finance Committee.  Without the amendment proposed by Labaronne, there would be a “risk of having operators just registering to benefit from the grandfather clause” set out under MiCA, which means they wouldn’t have to gain a full license until around March 2026, Labaronne told the committee.  The committee adopted his proposal, which must now be approved by the Assembly next week and negotiated with the Senate.  The Senate’s Herve Maurey proposed tightening the law following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. Existing French law allows companies to undergo the lighter process of registering, rather than seeking authorization, which requires a fuller series of checks on financial resources and business conduct. While many companies, including Binance and Societe Generale, have registered, none have so far been authorized.  The French crypto industry has reacted with concern to the proposals, arguing they could damage France’s goal of becoming a crypto hub.

42414668,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD6FT,1673996818,Finnish Minister Calls for EU Law to Recognize DAOs,"DAVOS, Switzerland — The European Union should consider legislation to recognize decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that govern Web3 applications, Finland’s communications minister said during a panel at this year's World Economic Forum.  The move could prevent having to alter thousands of laws or countries undercutting each other in the race to attract innovative business, Timo Harakka said.  “There are a lot of new players and actors in the Web3 world … not reflected very well in existing legislation,” he said. “Take a DAO for instance: Where does legislation stand?”  Harakka told CoinDesk new centralized laws could prevent a shattering of Europe’s legal codes – but that the European Commission, responsible for proposing new EU laws, had its eye on other matters.  Harakka said that ""thinking on a multinational level” is needed to avoid “harmful regulatory competition” among the bloc’s 27 members, and prevent having to individually alter thousands of different laws regulating different kinds of contracts. The approach is reminiscent of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) legislation, which will create a uniform standard for each country if it is adopted.  Read more: European Union Postpones MiCA Vote to April  “We are relying on the European Commission to be the initiator” and are “eagerly looking forward to its work,” he told CoinDesk – but said he was in the dark about whether it will be covered by a forthcoming policy paper on the metaverse, due in the spring.  “In DAOs it’s a different logic” to regulating corporations with named officers in charge, Harakka told CoinDesk. “Who’s responsible for transgressions?”  Europe had been “obsessed” with other issues like how to control privacy online, he said, but added that “remarkable and groundbreaking legislation will usher in the way to Web3” – a nod to recent and ongoing EU initiatives such as laws on online privacy, information flows and online market dominance.  But so far, he added, “I’m not sure we’ve seen a lot of thinking on Web3.”  Regulators across the world are struggling with how to classify and regulate decentralized initiatives such as financial applications in which there's no central lender. Some have argued decentralization is a myth, as in practice there's always someone in control; in the U.K., the Law Commission of England and Wales has published a consultation on how to deal with issues of structure, governance and taxation.  While some policymakers have argued it may be too early to get set rules for decentralized finance – and largely left the topic out of the EU’s landmark MiCA law – Harakka argued it’s time to start at least thinking about a philosophical approach to the issue.  It took two decades for the bloc to figure out how to regulate online data flows, he noted, and regulating smart contracts “could take a while as well.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/17/finnish-minister-calls-for-eu-law-to-recognize-daos,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b3641e5003ebbde30f20c8bacd81c2ae48926f3-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7697490,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570443-solana-a-roaring-comeback?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1673994951,Solana: A Roaring Comeback,"Summary Solana sold-off after the collapse of FTX, but it has rallied very strongly since finding a bottom at $8. Fundamentally, Solana is fast, but it lacks security and decentralization. $38 is a key resistance level to break. Thesis Summary Solana ( SOL-USD ) has been one of the most talked about coins in recent weeks. After a furious sell-off, sparked in part by the demise of FTX, ( FTT-USD ) the coin has now rallied over 200% since hitting a low just above $8. In this article, I discuss the outlook for Solana for 2023 from both a fundamental and technical perspective. Ultimately, and though I still hold Solana as part of my long-term portfolio, there are better coins out there. What Happened to Solana? Solana was one of the favourite crypto darlings of the 2020-21 bull-run. However, in 2022, it lost over 90% of its value, becoming one of the worst-performing altcoins. SOL Price (CoinMarketCap) This is not too out of line with the general crypto market, but Solana suffered more than many others after the demise of FTX, due to the strong ties the coin had with the exchange, Alameda and Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda and FTX were one of the main forces behind Solana, and also behind Serum. Serum was a decentralized exchange within the Solana blockchain and was the main liquidity provider for the growing DeFi ecosystem. However, with the collapse of FTX and Alameda, Serum also fell , and Solana’s DeFi was brought to a halt, temporarily. On top of that, because of their strong ties, Solana was one of Alameda’s core holdings besides the FTX token FTT. So when Alameda began to sell-off its assets, Solana was one of the coins which witnessed the most selling pressure. SOL Price (CoinMarketCap) We can see in the chart above how Solana swiftly fell from over $36 to a third of that in a matter of days. However, we can also see that the coin has rallied very strongly in 2023. Why Has Solana Rallied? Since bottoming at just over $8, Solana has rallied over 200%. Not a bad chunk of change for those capable of spotting this bottom. The rally in Solana has been accompanied by a rally in equities and also other cryptocurrencies. Overall, over the last few weeks, “risk-on” sentiment has returned, as inflation cools and expectations of a Fed pivot have increased. The early rally in SOL could also be partly attributed to the airdrop carried out by Shiba- inu inspired token (BONK). 50% of the supply of his Solana meme-coin was distributed last week, with 20% going towards NFT collections and 10% towards Solana creators. This could have been the reason for some of the renewed excitement behind Solana. Still, I believe most of this rally can be attributed to the fact that Solana was very oversold and that the general marker has seen a strong rebound. Solana has simply benefitted from the fact that it had much more retracement to carry out. The real question now, for investors, is whether Solana is worth buying/holding in 2023. 2023 Outlook: Fundamentals and Technicals From a fundamental perspective, I still believe Solana is not as compelling as some of the other L1 coins out there. With Ethereum’s ( ETH-USD ) transition to PoS, Solana’s competitive advantage has been diminished. Solana still is, technically, one of the fastest blockchains, being able to carry out 50,000 TPS theoretically . But speed is only one of many important aspects, and what Solana has in speed, it lacks in security and decentralization. Security has been a problem for Solana recently, which I pointed out months ago. Solana’s network suffered three major outages in 2022. More recently, Solana has warned that its Mailchimp information had been compromised. On top of that, Solana is one of the least decentralized networks out there. There are fewer validators than in other blockchains, and the token distribution is highly skewed in favour of insiders. SOL distribution (Messari) If we add up Rewards & Airdrops and coins held by Founders & Perojectm we see that 63% of the supply is in the hands of insiders, with only 37% left for actual investors. This gives the foundation a lot of power and makes the network a lot more centralized. Now, moving on to the technical chart: SOL chart (Author's work) It’s very interesting to see that Sol has turned around almost exactly at the 61.8% retracement level. This would be an ideal place to start a wave 3, but I should mention that a lot of coins have reached lower retracements. The key resistance to surpass, which will make me bullish, is marked by the red line provided by the VPVR. This shows a major area of volume at around $38, which will act as very strong resistance. This is actually also very near where we have our wave ii high. If this level is breached, I will assume that a rally in wave 3 has begun, which could take Solana into the $300-$400.

This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  CoinDesk has identified 196 members of the new Congress – many of whom were just sworn in last week – who took cash from Sam Bankman-Fried or other senior executives at FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy protection in Delaware in November after CoinDesk revealed unusually close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund. The names in Congress range from the heights of both chambers, including new Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to recipients new to high-level politics.  After the lawmakers received the money, it became clear – according to the work of journalists, the criminal charges and admissions of guilt from FTX insiders – that the funds sprang from this colossal financial swindle. CoinDesk reached out to all 196 lawmakers to ask what they would do with the money.  Most of the politicians who responded said they handed it over to charities to remove the taint of the contributions from executives such as former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried, whose federal fraud charges also include an accusation that he violated campaign-finance laws. Others have revealed they had conversations with the U.S. Department of Justice about setting aside the money until it can be dropped into a fund to compensate FTX victims.  Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) was among dozens of current or incoming members of Congress who took FTX contributions, in his case the full limit of $2,900 directly from Bankman-Fried.  ""I don't know the gentleman – never talked to him,” Correa told CoinDesk. But Correa said he intended to donate that same amount to his alma mater, California State University, Fullerton, “to support their Dreamer education fund.""

42411278,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMaWj,1673993763,"FTX's Failure Highlights Need for Federally Mandated Insurance, Not More Regulation","The usual conversations are taking place about what new regulations need to be enacted to prevent another FTX. While it is obvious something needs to happen, experience makes clear that the current regulatory regime is not well equipped to prevent these events. Indeed, even if the Securities and Exchange Commission, for example, did have the knowledge and agility required to adequately regulate Web3, its reach extends only to the limits of its jurisdiction and, as we have seen with the Bahamas-based FTX, that reach was too short by about 150 miles.  As founders of the first crypto and blockchain infrastructure insurance company, we suggest regulator-required insurance as a market-oriented means of preventing the damage caused by crypto exchange insolvency and related catastrophic events.  CEO Jared Gdanski and President Raymond Zenkich are co-founders of Evertas, a crypto insurance company.  Just as auto insurance has led to safer cars involved in fewer and less-damaging accidents, requiring crypto-asset exchanges to undergo a rigorous underwriting process to become and remain insurable will make insolvency events much less likely to occur, while reducing the damaging reverberations that follow if they do.  There is extensive precedent for the federal government and its regulatory agencies encouraging and often requiring companies providing critical infrastructure to secure insurance, particularly those covering rapidly evolving risks which statutes struggle to keep up with.  When discussing opportunities for the federal government to work with the private sector in reducing terror threats, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said, “Sometimes it's a question of letting the private sector find a coordinated way to make sure people can operate in a consistent manner across the board. Sometimes we can ... be a little bit more vigorous in using market-based incentives; working with the insurance industry, for example, doing other things to take advantage of the energy of the marketplace.”  Though much differentiates cyber and crypto insurance, the shared network security component makes cyber insurance a useful reference point. Here, regulators have gone to great lengths to encourage internet companies to carry cyber coverage, the benefits of which were very elegantly observed by the Obama Administration in the report, ""Cyber-Insurance Metrics and Impact on Cyber-Security"":  “Insurers will require a level of security as a precondition of coverage, and companies adopting better security practices often receive lower insurance rates. This helps companies to internalize both the benefits of good security and the costs of poor security, which in turn leads to greater investment and improvements in cyber-security.”  A rigorous underwriting of an entity the size of FTX would have required an active and independent board of directors as a condition of insurability.  The underwriting process would also include a review of the histories of key personnel, accounts and associated crypto wallet addresses to ensure that only reputable people are involved, reserves are sufficient and assets are present. This likely would have resulted in FTX selecting a chief compliance officer better suited to the job.  Finally, the underwriting process would examine the exchange’s policies to ensure that customer and institutional funds are thoroughly segregated, such that the former’s funds can’t be used to settle the latter’s debts nor finance their own trading. This would also see that assets are returned to their owners in case of insolvency.  Admittedly, the FTX terms and conditions did segregate account holder funds, though it appears that’s not how they were treated. If active deception is the goal, neither insurance nor regulation can prevent that.  The pervasive libertarian ethos in the Web3 world always results in strong reactions to talk of further government regulation. But avoidable losses or failures, particularly at the scale of an FTX, hurts the cause of broad-based adoption of blockchain technology with its many benefits of improved transparency, transactional friction, resilience and censorship resistance. We believe that regulator-required insurance is the kind of agile, responsive and precise market-based solution that the Web3 community will accept and needs in order to allow present and future users, builders, participants and even regulators to view the sector with the confidence it deserves.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,"Jared Gdanski , Raymond Zenkich",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/17/ftxs-failure-highlights-need-for-federally-mandated-insurance-not-more-regulation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/95127e81cb5f93151c46d28bf2210110aed11f64-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

They noted there is a ""substantial shortfall of digital assets"" at both FTX.com, the international exchange, and FTX US, the American exchange. For FTX.com, the FTX debtors identified ~$1.6B of digital assets, of which $323M was subject to unauthorized third-party transfers after the petition date of Nov. 11, 2022, $426M of which was transferred to cold storage under the control of The Securities Commission of The Bahamas, $742M of which is in cold storage under the control of the FTX debtors, and $121M of which is pending transfer to cold storage under the control of the FTX debtors. With respect to FTX US, some $181M was found by FTX debtors, of which $90M was subject to unauthorized third-party transfers post-petition, $88M of which is in cold storage under the control of the FTX debtors, and $3M of which is pending transfer to cold storage under the control of the FTX debtors. ""We are making important progress in our efforts to maximize recoveries, and it has taken a Herculean investigative effort from our team to uncover this preliminary information,"" said John J.

The discount of around 40% could be closed by partial liquidation and buying back shares, but this is unlikely to be pursued by Grayscale. Institutional adoption of crypto has likely peaked and declining interest from this cohort could reduce any near-term upside for Bitcoin. Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) investors broadly fall into two categories. The arbitrageurs and the Bitcoin bulls. The former are pulled into a trust trading at around a 40% discount to its net asset value which holds 0.00091227 in Bitcoin per share. The eventual closing of this discount forms the theoretical base of the bull case and is backstopped by the trust's ongoing litigation with the SEC to convert into a spot ETF. If successful, this would spark a significant rally. Data by YCharts Grayscale's previous attempt to convert GBTC into a spot Bitcoin ETF failed because the SEC deemed the ETF application did not have enough controls to protect investors from ""fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices."" This statement has been repeated by the SEC in all of its Bitcoin ETF rejections. Hence, whilst I'll refrain from commenting on the potential outcome of the legal case, it's important to point out that Grayscale's parent company Digital Currency Group has been ensnarled in numerous controversies and investigations over the last month. DCG's financial dealings are being investigated by the SEC and federal prosecutors in Brooklyn just as its crypto broker Genesis is being sued by regulators for incorrectly selling unregistered securities to the general public. DCG also owes $3 billion to a consortium of creditors and had at least $175 million worth of funds stuck in the bankrupt FTX platform. Hence, it's hard to see how the discount, likely partially driven by a crisis of confidence in DCG, can be slimmed with the overhang of such pertinent issues. Institutional Adoption Falls To A Point Of No Return Large-scale institutional adoption of Bitcoin like Tesla's now abandoned use of crypto as a payment method helped to drive the previous 2021 highs. The bearish argument here is that institutional crypto adoption is unlikely to return to the level of hype and euphoria of the pandemic years. Firstly, the regulatory backdrop has turned dark with the SEC actively pursuing an aggressive policy as a form of a retrospective reaction to the high-level collapses of crypto firms seen last year. The SEC is looking to categorize and regulate Bitcoin as a security, New York State-registered banks now need to receive regulatory permission 90 days before they get involved in crypto, and more US states are also looking to place heavier regulatory bottlenecks on crypto activity. At least three crypto companies pulled their plans to go public via blank check firms late last year. This includes stablecoin provider Circle and crypto exchange Bullish . Further, venture capital investment in crypto companies has collapsed with relevant downstream impacts on the overall ecosystem. VC investment in crypto startups in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $2.3 billion , a 75% decline from the year-ago period. We could see a secular trend where generalist VC funds move previously planned crypto capital to other investment thematics to the detriment of the institutional crypto infrastructure. Closing The Discount Gap Faces A 2% Annual Management Fee GBTC's 2% annual management fee is large. In an open letter to DCG, crypto asset manager Osprey Funds suggests the trust reduces its annual fee to 0.49% and implement a redemption program not dissimilar to that of Sprott Physical Gold Trust ( PHYS ). Sprott allows unitholders to redeem for physical metals on a monthly basis. At one point GBTC's discount to NAV reached nearly 50% with the market taking an extremely bearish view on the outlook for Bitcoin and DCG. Indeed, the last six months for the cryptocurrency has at times seemed like the requiem for a lost dream. Not only is DCG currently in a public fight with the 10th largest cryptocurrency exchange Gemini after its subsidiary Genesis suspended withdrawals for the exchange's Earn product last year, but the company is also facing bankruptcy rumours . With ARK Invest's Cathie Woods just coming out with a stratospheric price target of $1 million per Bitcoin by 2030, the underlying euphoria is clearly still there but has met the new realities of a market facing structural decline from an institutional perspective to a new low. The most salient of the factors that drove Bitcoin to reach highs of around $66,000 per Bitcoin in 2021 is retrenching and the ramifications will likely be an extension of the crypto winter. GBTC's most obvious response to close the discount to NAV would be to liquidate its Bitcoin holdings and use the proceeds to buy back shares of the trust in the open market. This would force sentiment to change and create a backstop preventing the trust from trading at a material discount to its NAV. Management has announced that it could liquidate up to 600,000 of its Bitcoin to fund a tender offer for its shares. Whilst this would be the path forward for shareholders, Grayscale will likely hold off on this for as long as possible as it would reduce the pool of assets they charge their fee. A 2% fee is material against a trust whose only mandate is to buy a single asset, this is more than 4x the amount charged by Sprott for its gold trust. I believe that correcting this and partial liquidation are the only way forward in the event the company's legal case fails. I'm neutral on Bitcoin's near-term future but GBTC likely represents one of the more unattractive ways to gain exposure to the digital asset.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570433-grayscale-bitcoin-trust-should-liquidate-and-move-on?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7695972.jpeg

42414671,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD6VO,1673989374,FTX Debtors Give Details on Digital Assets Identified So Far,"FTX Trading and its affiliated debtors, collectively known as the FTX Debtors, have provided details on the digital assets they’ve identified so far in their attempts to recover funds from the bankrupt crypto exchange and its subsidiaries, according to a press release on Tuesday.  Roughly half of those digital assets are already under the control of FTX Debtors, but the other half was subject to unauthorized third-party transfers after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, as well as transferred to the control of the Securities Commission of the Bahamas in the case of FTX.com, according to the group.  Overall, the group affirmed that a total of about $5.5 billion in liquid assets have been identified, consisting of $1.7 billion in cash, $3.5 billion of crypto assets and FTT tokens and $300 million of securities. And it confirmed that based on current estimates of the amount of digital assets associated with FTX.com and FTX US, there is a “substantial shortfall” at both exchanges.  Regarding FTX.com, the FTX debtors have identified $1.6 billion of digital assets associated with FTX.com, of which $323 million “was subject to unauthorized third-party transfers post-petition, $426 million of which was transferred to cold storage under the control of The Securities Commission of The Bahamas, $742 million of which is in cold storage under the control of the FTX Debtors, and $121 million of which is pending transfer to cold storage under the control of the FTX Debtors.”  With respect to FTX US, the debtors have identified roughly $181 million of digital assets, “$90 million of which was subject to unauthorized third-party transfers post-petition, $88 million of which is in cold storage under the control of the FTX Debtors, and $3 million of which is pending transfer to cold storage under the control of the FTX Debtors.”  This implies that a total of $413 million worth of crypto has been stolen from both FTX and FTX US, since the exchange's bankruptcy.  ""We are making important progress in our efforts to maximize recoveries, and it has taken a Herculean investigative effort from our team to uncover this preliminary information,"" said John J.

42393871,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brb13Z,1673988487,Crypto Markets Analysis:  Fear Abates as Bitcoin Enters New Level of Support,"Bitcoin (BTC) and most other major cryptos have been soaring, but the upswing may only be part of the reason for investors to be optimistic.  Several key trading trends are pointing upward for the first time in months, suggesting the current rally will be more than just a temporary improvement. They reflect surging investor confidence that has also carried stock markets higher, albeit to a lesser degree than cryptocurrencies, and offer a welcome pause from months-long negativity that sent riskier assets dramatically lower throughout 2023.  ""Whale"" investors are not moving BTC onto exchanges as they often do during dramatic price surges, over-the-counter (OTC) desks have sharply increased their holdings and the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a widely watched measure of investor sentiment, has entered neutral territory for the first time in 10 months.  Bitcoin was recently snugly perched above $21,000, which may become its new support threshold. Ether (ETH) was holding steady above $1,500 after weeks of hobbling below $1,200. Equity markets have risen more moderately, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500, which has a hefty technology component, climbing 5.8% and 2.8%, respectively. How long these trends continue is uncertain of course. The ensuing weeks will be interesting.  Whale investor activity  Given their size, whales – investors holding at least 1,000 bitcoin – can significantly affect markets through their buying and selling.  Whales' recent lack of movement indicates they do not view the recent rally as a selling opportunity. This trend still bears monitoring but appears to be positive for long investors.  Increased over-the-counter bitcoin holdings.  As referenced in Tuesday’s First Mover Americas, the amount of BTC that investors are holding on OTC desks has risen 70% since Jan. 11.  The increased OTC holdings often signal increased institutional demand. Investors can also use OTC desks to source more capital than they can on a singular exchange, which also implies an uptick in investor demand.  The most sophisticated investors use OTC desks to acquire an asset quietly and more efficiently than they could in open markets..  The Fear & Greed Index turns 'neutral'  The Fear & Greed index ranges from 0 to 100. Lower numbers reflect negative sentiment (fear) and buying opportunities, while higher numbers indicate that markets are overheated and that investors might consider selling their bitcoin.  The current 51 reading is the first time in 10 months that the indicator has broken from the “Fear” range. The Fear & Greed Index stood below 10 just seven months ago and hovered in the mid 20s for much of the fall and early winter weeks.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/17/crypto-markets-analysis-fear-abates-as-bitcoin-enters-new-level-of-support,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1e7832a42d104d9a50894bc0a3a36d29bcdb79a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Note CBDCs are a type of digital currency issued and backed by a central bank (think Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, etc.) instead of a commercial bank. In essence, they are a digital form of a country's fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar ( DXY ) and euro, designed to boost efficiency and reduce costs typically through the use of blockchain technology. ""CBDCs have the potential to revolutionize global financial systems and may be the most significant technological advancement in the history of money,"" Shah contended. As of now, 114 central banks are exploring CBDCs, up significantly from 35 in May 2020, he added. In the meantime, financial systems are built on centralized infrastructure that requires third-party intermediaries, which ""limits efficiencies, interoperability, innovation and functionality, such as conditional payments."" Distributed ledgers, though, are built on decentralized infrastructure that ""removes fragmentation and the need for intermediaries, which increases efficiencies, interoperability and innovation and expands functionality by replacing APIs with smart contracts."" There are risks involved with CBDCs, Shah warned, depending on their design and issuance. He expects central banks in developed economies to start focusing on payments efficiency, while those in developing economies will focus initially on financial inclusion. One of the big risks is that CBDCs could drive competition with bank deposits, potentially leading to a loss of monetary sovereignty and inequality among countries across the globe, according to the note. In November 2022, Japan's central bank was said to conduct CBDC experiments with three banking giants .

42414672,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD6g0,1673982793,Congress' FTX Problem: 1 in 3 Members Got Cash From Crypto Exchange's Bosses,"More than one in three of the 535 senators and representatives in the U.S. Congress showed up to the new session with FTX baggage, having received campaign support from one of the senior executives of the fraud-ridden crypto giant.  CoinDesk has identified 196 members of the new Congress – many of whom were just sworn in last week – who took cash from Sam Bankman-Fried or other senior executives at FTX, a crypto exchange that filed for bankruptcy in Delaware in November after CoinDesk revealed unusually close ties between FTX and Alameda Research, an affiliated hedge fund. The names in Congress range from the heights of both chambers, including new Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), down to a list of recipients new to high-level politics.  After the lawmakers received the money, it became clear – according to the work of journalists, the criminal charges and admissions of guilt from FTX insiders – that the funds sprang from this colossal financial swindle. CoinDesk reached out to all 196 lawmakers to ask what they would do with the money.  Most of the politicians who responded said they handed it over to charities to remove the taint of contributions from executives such as former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried, whose federal fraud charges also include an accusation that he violated campaign-finance laws. Others have revealed they had conversations with the U.S. Department of Justice about setting aside the money until it can be dropped into a fund to compensate FTX victims.  Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) was among dozens of current or incoming members of Congress who took FTX contributions, in his case the full limit of $2,900 directly from Bankman-Fried.  ""I don't know the gentleman – never talked to him,” Correa told CoinDesk. But Correa said he intended to donate that same amount to his alma mater, California State University, Fullerton, “to support their Dreamer education fund.""     Charitable contributions  Of the 53 campaigns that responded on the record, 64% decided to forward the donated amounts to nonprofit causes.  Incoming Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas) planned to forward contributions from an FTX executive and Bankman-Fried’s brother to the advocacy group Fight Corporate Monopolies, while Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) said he would give to a “crisis pregnancy center” back home because, a spokeswoman said, he “believes these funds should be donated to a worthy cause, given the information that has come to light about FTX and its leaders.”  However, the campaigns channeling tainted money to favored charities may not escape the reach of FTX’s bankruptcy case. And even the organizations they give to could be roped in.  “Making a payment or donation to a third party (including a charity) in the amount of any payment received from a FTX contributor does not prevent the FTX debtors from seeking recovery,” FTX warned in a December statement. The company is now controlled by CEO John Ray III, whose primary job is to recover money for the company’s fleeced creditors, though it isn’t yet clear whether political donations – nominally made directly from the individual’s personal accounts – will be subject to clawbacks.  The company said it’s inviting any recipients of donations from FTX executives to return the money soon, according to the statement. If the money was stolen, it was never theirs to give. Several of the campaigns told CoinDesk that they’re in touch with the bankruptcy team or government authorities and are trying to determine how to give the money back.  “We have received guidance from the Department of Justice that dollars received from FTX executives should be set aside for when a victims' compensation fund is created in the future,” said Chris Carroll, campaign manager for Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), whose campaign accepted a contribution from Nishad Singh, one of the executives who contributed millions last year.  The current chaos at FTX means giving the money back is easier said than done. Of the recipients who responded to CoinDesk’s inquiries, 38% said they were holding the money and waiting for guidance on how to give it back. Only five politicians said they had already successfully returned the money.     Clawbacks are coming  If, during FTX’s bankruptcy process, the money its executives gave to campaigns (as well as other causes) is deemed “fraudulent conveyances,” the recipients have to give it back to FTX’s estate.  Anthony Sabino, a bankruptcy expert and professor of law at St. John’s University, told CoinDesk that the courts will work out whether this cash is tied to fraud, though clawing it back to FTX creditors could take years. Victims of Bernie Madoff are still receiving payments 14 years after his arrest.  According to Sabino, the game of hot potato that campaigns play by giving donations to charity is a ""political move"" that doesn’t magically absolve them from their responsibility to pay back the money.  “The law does not care if you gave it to Mother Teresa,” Sabino said.  And if the money has already been spent? Sabino says, “tough luck.”  “If you no longer have the money, too bad,” he said. “You are still liable. You might go bankrupt yourself.”     Giving it back  Though the charity hot potato was the most common response CoinDesk received from politicians, another sizable group of respondents said they were working on giving the money back.    Some, like Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), say they have already returned the donations to FTX. Others, including Reps. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) and Angie Craig (D-Minn.) and Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), say they’re holding the funds and waiting for instructions from either the courts or government agencies on what to do with them.  Still others are simply confused. Several campaign managers who spoke to CoinDesk expressed frustration with the situation, saying they don’t know how to give the funds back.  Matt Lusty, a campaign adviser for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), who received money from Ryan Salame, the co-CEO of FTX Digital Markets, told CoinDesk the campaign was “looking for an appropriate place to make a donation in that amount.”  “There is nowhere to return the donation since his assets have been seized,” Lusty said.  Lee’s fellow Utah Senator, Mitt Romney (R-Utah), chose not to let the FTX founder’s dirty money linger while he waited for clear instructions on how to return what Bankman-Fried had donated. Instead, he gave the $5,800 to the U.S. Treasury.     Keeping mum  Of the 196 members of Congress who accepted campaign contributions from FTX’s former executives, 73% didn’t respond to CoinDesk’s requests for comment, and so it’s unclear what they are doing with the money.  Some of Congress’ most crypto-friendly members, including Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who received $8,700 from Salame and Zach Dexter (the CEO of FTX US subsidiary LedgerX), have kept mum on the subject. Emmer has largely treated the FTX crash like a blip, continuing his rhetorical crusade on behalf of the industry in speeches and appearances since the exchange filed for bankruptcy in November.  Emmer, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Blockchain Congress, has argued that the FTX collapse was a “failure of character,” not of crypto, but added that the industry will keep growing. “You do not get growth without taking risk,” he told a cryptocurrency industry crowd in Washington, D.C., the week after FTX went down.  Other members of the caucus who received money from FTX executives – like Reps. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.) and David Schweikert (R-Ariz.), another of the co-chairs – seemed eager to distance themselves from their donors, telling CoinDesk the money has already been donated to charity or returned to FTX.     Firehose of money  Most of the attention on Bankman-Fried’s campaign largesse has focused on the firehose of indirect money he aimed at congressional Democrats in the primary elections last year, through his own and other political action committees. He spent $40 million in the past two years – donations that are now under scrutiny by the FTX bankruptcy team and federal prosecutors – though the cash was largely spent on such things as television advertisements and political mailers.  Thad Wilson, a bankruptcy attorney at law firm King & Spalding, said that vendors could find the FTX estate knocking on their doors, taking back money that – for instance – paid television or radio stations to air political advertisements.  Wilson said that clawbacks in previous fraud cases, such as the Allen Stanford Ponzi scheme, set a legal precedent. In that case, several campaigns and politicians were hit with clawback claims, including former President Barack Obama, who had given the money to charity and balked at returning it. Even the Golf Channel, which had allegedly been paid with money from the scheme, was sued for fraudulent transfers.  The drama over FTX cash could get even messier than dragging the Golf Channel through the courts. Bankman-Fried’s family – including brother Gabe – was highly involved in his political engagement, and Wilson said it’s not uncommon for litigation to extend to family members, “particularly where the size of the donations were significant.”  While Bankman-Fried and his colleagues made a staggering number of highly visible, direct donations, those actual dollar amounts represent a sliver of their political investment. The type of PACs they favored, which don’t carry the same limits for the amount of cash individuals can shovel in, focus on what are known as “independent expenditures,” meaning political help that’s not officially tied to campaigns. The dollars that flow through such PACs can also be “dark money,” coming from unnamed donors through nonprofit intermediaries – something like the crypto mixer services of political spending.  The 30-year-old disgraced CEO said after his resignation that he had taken public credit for Democratic spending, but he had also funneled money to Republicans. That remark seems to have been echoed in his criminal proceedings in which he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and commit campaign-finance violations, specifically accused of propping up “wealthy co-conspirators” as straw donors contributing funds that he was secretly supplying.  A spokesman for Bankman-Fried declined to comment for this story.  The bulk of FTX spending on Republican candidates came from one of Bankman-Fried’s underlings, Salame, who hasn’t been accused of criminal involvement as of press time. While Bankman-Fried’s 2022 giving had stunned national politics by raising him to a one-time rank as fourth-largest individual political donor, Salame’s spending had also lifted his name to 11th place, according to OpenSecrets.org. Salame didn’t respond to a request for comment.    Salame was a fixture in the Republican congressional primaries as the companion of Michelle Bond, a crypto advocate who ran as a Republican candidate for New York’s 1st District. The two were even seen hobnobbing with Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s son. But Salame was more influential as a donor, giving about $24 million to the party’s candidates and causes.  Another major contributor was Singh, one of the inner circle of top FTX employees running the global business. He gave almost $10 million to Democratic candidates and progressive political action committees in the last cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records. A lawyer representing Singh declined to comment.  One other FTX donor was Mark Wetjen, a former commissioner and acting chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who FTX hired in 2021 to head its policy work in Washington. The campaigns he gave to generally overlapped with Bankman-Fried donations, though Wetjen gave modest amounts and made fewer than two dozen contributions. He also declined to comment.     Personal money  All of the direct donations that politicians are scrambling to cleanse from their campaigns came from the executives’ personal money, and so until a legal determination emerges that the funds really should be considered part of the company’s bankruptcy, Sabino, the St. John’s professor, said a clawback process “does not affect donations [Bankman-Fried] made with his own money.”  “Likewise for other [executives] of FTX who donated their personal money,” Sabino added.  Bankman-Fried has been charged with campaign fraud, and prosecutors have alleged that he hid the true source of funds he donated. But the accusations are scant in detail about what exactly is being alleged. And authorities haven’t yet hinted at whether the same level of scrutiny will be applied to donations made by Salame and others.  Some additional confusion could arise over the mess Bankman-Fried made in his direct giving, often donating repeatedly and well beyond federal limits for individual contributions, according to an analysis of federal records. The maximum per election was capped at $2,900 during this cycle, which could amount to $5,800 for both a primary and general election.  For instance, in the case of Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Bankman-Fried apparently contributed six times for a $17,400 total, according to federal records. A representative of the campaign said the amount over the limit was given back in September and October of 2021.  And on one date in 2021, Bankman-Fried apparently contributed to Romney six times for $31,900, though the campaign returned all but the legal limit of $5,800.  The FTX executives typically targeted candidates already in power who weren’t likely to lose it, and they only sent money to a couple of dozen candidates who lost. Despite the abundance of conspiracy theories around Bankman-Fried’s financial relationship with Democrats, he openly gave to 10 Republican lawmakers.  Some of his cash went to prominent senators who weren’t even running in last year’s election, such as Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Romney and John Boozman (R-Ark.).     Specter of SBF  The 37% of Congress who took FTX money will now be among lawmakers deciding how the U.S. should regulate cryptocurrencies – and whether to follow the route Bankman-Fried lobbied for. This session is expected to produce at least some initial attempts at laws governing crypto assets, and the damage wrought by FTX will be in the forefront of that debate.  While Bankman-Fried sits in his parents’ Stanford, Calif., home wearing an ankle monitor and awaiting the developments of his criminal prosecution, a key figure – Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee – has begun talks about the contours of a crypto bill. And despite loud crowing on social media that Bankman-Fried’s arrest heralds the death of the controversial crypto regulation bill he supported (the bipartisan Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, or DCCPA), experts say that and other legislative efforts will continue.  Though the discourse on Capitol Hill will remain hyper-aware of Bankman-Fried’s recent Washington ties, the fact of his widespread relationships with lawmakers won’t itself kill the work, said Jenny Lee, a partner at law firm Reed Smith’s Financial Industry Group and a former enforcement attorney at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  “With the FTX bankruptcy, there is a public focus that is intense enough that we might have a chance at more thoughtful rulemaking,” Lee said. “We’ve been regulating these underlying issues for more than 100 years, and it will take some thoughtful analysis, reference back to history and deep understanding of the technical issues on the part of regulators and lawmakers to apply it to crypto in a manner that does not do more harm than good.”  Many of the lawmakers who temporarily benefited from the sudden crypto riches of FTX’s political novices are now issuing scathing comments about the recklessness of company officials – and calling for tough industry oversight. So as crypto regulation progresses, the industry may face politicians who feel they had been burned before by digital-asset advocates.  A comment from Craig – a congresswoman from Minnesota who accepted money from Bankman-Fried and Singh and who now hopes to return it to the bankruptcy effort – is typical of many of the sentiments shared with CoinDesk.  “Congress must take immediate action to regulate the crypto industry, implement strict oversight standards and shield consumers from schemes like this in the future,” she said.  A spokesperson for Romney said that the prominent lawmaker “condemns Sam Bankman-Fried’s reprehensible behavior and believes he must be held accountable for his actions – which have caused harm to many.”  Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who received a contribution from an FTX executive who wasn’t among the biggest donors, said the company’s implosion is definitely shaping how Congress is viewing the industry.  ""Shields are up here,” he told CoinDesk TV on Thursday. “The industry – broadly speaking – and the players in the industry no longer have the benefit of the doubt.""  Himes said U.S. lawmakers are now looking with more suspicion at other platforms, such as Binance.  ""None of us has any confidence, really, that there aren't other FTXs brewing out there,"" he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,"Jesse Hamilton, Cheyenne Ligon, Elizabeth Napolitano",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/01/17/congress-ftx-problem-1-in-3-members-got-cash-from-crypto-exchanges-bosses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/15b707d34c74e847a4b1592bd08a1095ccfcefb1-2048x1535.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

New laws will make the country the world’s leading jurisdiction for crypto assets, said Mykhailo Fedorov, who is also Ukraine's minister for digital transformation, after Ukraine successfully used crypto to raise money for its armed forces.  “Two weeks ago, I saw a pilot of the electronic e-hyrvnia in Ukraine,” he said, speaking through an interpreter, of plans to issue a CBDC in cooperation with crypto non-profit the Stellar Development Foundation. “I plan on becoming the first test user of the electronic hryvnia and I plan to receive on receiving my salary in e-hryvnia.”  Ukraine is one of a number of countries around the world considering whether to issue fiat money in digital form, with draft legislation on a digital euro due from the neighboring European Union later this year.  In Ukraine, virtual assets legislation signed into law last year, just weeks after the country’s invasion by Russia, will be supplemented by a new tax law for crypto and by a CBDC law due next year from the National Bank of Ukraine, Fedorov said.

Over the last 24 hours, SHIB has appreciated by 2.9%, but despite the rise in value, the coin has remained stuck below the $0.000011 mark. The coin broke above its stern resistance mark of $0.000010, which had not been breached for the past two months. SHIB was trading within an ascending parallel chain, which showed bullishness; however, the coin was currently outside the ascending trendline. Related Reading: Myth Buster: Ethereum Shanghai Hard Fork Won’t Create Major Selling Pressure As it moved out of the ascending trendline, it could not break past its immediate resistance level. The technical outlook of the coin still depicts bullishness on the chart for SHIB. Shiba Inu was overvalued at the time of writing, and if a coin is overbought, there are chances of a price correction. This could be true if the coin does not break past the $0.000011 level. Currently, SHIB is trading 87% below its all-time high of 2021. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: One-Day Chart SHIB was exchanging hands at $0.0000106 at the time of writing. The altcoin moved outside the ascending parallel line and experienced resistance at $0.000011. Overhead resistance for Shiba Inu was at $0.0000108; a move above that level can push SHIB to breach the $0.000011 mark. The $0.0000112 mark has previously acted as a strong resistance for the coin. If the coin fails to move above the resistance line, it could fall to $0.0000100 and then to $0.0000097 before rising again. This could also present a shorting opportunity to the traders. The amount of SHIB traded in the last session was green depicting bullish momentum. Technical Analysis SHIB has managed to secure a multi-month high regarding demand. The Relative Strength Index was at 80, which meant that the asset was overvalued and buyers exceeded sellers. The last time the indicator touched the 80-mark was in August 2022, leading to a price correction. The asset price moved above the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line and was also above the 50-SMA (yellow) line as buyers drove the price momentum. Shiba Inu, however, struggled to move above the 200-SMA line (green). The altcoin price may remain congested during the following trading sessions due to lateral trading. However, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) formed green bars tied to buy signals for the coin. The last signal declined in strength, indicating that buying the asset might not be the right decision. The Directional Movement Index was positive, as the +DI (blue) line was above the -DI (orange) line. Related Reading: Myth Buster: Ethereum Shanghai Hard Fork Won’t Create Major Selling Pressure The Average Directional Index shot up near 40, depicting strength in the current price action. This meant that the overall SHIB was positive, but as the coin was restricted under the 200-SMA, there could be continued consolidation, leading to a loss of value.

Nagarajan said that CBDCs are the future of money, but issuers need to consider a hybrid-like model.  “They are replacing the current digital currency system, and in a way, they are controlled,” Nagarajan said. “This is an excellent position where a combination of permissioned and permissionless is necessary.”  While many CBDC pilot projects are still in a development phases, Nagarajan said payments will eventually be made with CBDCs. In the meantime, stablecoins, which are a form of cryptocurrency pegged to real-world assets such as gold or the U.S. dollar, are working as “stopgaps until CBDCS are available in the market.”  Rob Massey, global tax leader, blockchain and cryptocurrency at Deloitte, echoed Nagarajan's comments in a separate segment on “First Mover.” He said the ability to use programmable money with smart contracts can reduce friction and “help large-scale enterprises elevate their level of transparency and real-time payment systems.”  “It’s absolutely where we’re going,” Massey said, although he cautioned that not all CBDCs, stablecoins and smart-contract protocols “are created equal.”  Read more: Bank of America Says CBDCs Are the Future of Money and Payments",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/01/17/cbdcs-are-the-future-of-money-ibm-exec-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d026ba6c7072095ab76fa3b73b0a3c751412f93f-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Also, SOL’s exposure to FTX caused its price to decline rapidly following the FTX saga in November 2022. SOL has also been a beneficiary of the crypto market upturn as it continues its climb back to the top. Although it is still off its all-time high (ATH) value, it has shown positive signs in 2023. Related Reading: Bitcoin aSOPR Again Retests Bull-Bear Junction Level, Will Resistance Break This Time? What Is Driving The Solana Price Increase? Solana has launched a series of innovative projects that have increased interest among the crypto community. SolanaMobile announced on Twitter its plans to unveil the Solana Mobile stack and Saga phones. This mobile device intends to provide users with easy access to the blockchain. They assured their users of its availability for early 2023. Also, Solana offers its users a seamless payment protocol launched in February 2022. Brands such as @FastAF and @ASICSamerica, use this innovation. The payment channel allows merchants to interact on a secure blockchain and process payments efficiently. Moreover, the Solana network has become a developer’s hub as 2053 active developers worked on the blockchain in December 2022. These developers take advantage of the network’s unique proof-of-history mechanism to develop innovative apps on the network. The network prides itself on being carbon neutral since it does not rely on energy-intensive methods like proof-of-work. It means that the project aligns with environmental goals. The SOL network also progressed with Web3 advancement teaming up with Brave. Solana was integrated into the Brave browser, making it easier for more people to participate in the Web3 trend. These factors, and other macroeconomic factors such as inflation decline, have aided the price improvement noted in SOL. Investors will hope that the rally continues without any setbacks from external factors. Solana Price Prediction Solana is currently trading at $23.18 in the crypto market. On the price charts, more green candlesticks are showing increased bullish momentum. SOL trades above its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and below its 200-day (SMA). This pattern suggests the rally might be short live. However, SOL is close to its 200-day SMA and will likely surpass it in the coming days. The support levels are $20.53, $21.57, and $22.58. The resistance levels are $24.64, $25.68, and $26.69. Solana is currently testing the $24.63 level, with a slight pullback present in its uptrend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is in the overbought zone at 79.29; the RSI might retrace and fall into the neutral zone. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is currently above its signal line and showing a bullish signal. Solana will likely continue its rise in the coming days.

42417083,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOo9,1673975450,Crypto Marketing Needs to Change. Let’s Make 2023 the Year for Influencer Accountability,"Sold a beachside paradise with A-list models including Kendall Jenner, millennials swarmed to the Bahamas in 2017 for the ill-fated Fyre Festival.  We all know what happened next: Wrecked local businesses, dilapidated cheese sandwiches and deceived customers who formed a class-action lawsuit against organizers who used their money to bankroll decadent lifestyles. At the core of the media circus was the role of influencer marketing. Having failed to properly vet the new concept or disclose financial relationships to Fyre, celebrities poneyed up after government agencies came knocking. Jenner, for instance, was forced to pay $90,000 out of pocket for her role in promoting the festival.  Nemo Yang is the Founder and CEO of Oxygen, the Web3 marketing platform.  From the tropical environment to the dynastic celebrity families involved, Fyre Festival mirrors the FTX meltdown and other prominent crypto scandals that have blown up these past few months. Despite the lack of regulatory clarity surrounding crypto, much less the compliance scrutiny that traditional financial institutions face, Tom Brady gave FTX his seal of approval as Sam Bankman-Fried’s team proceeded to lose billions of dollars while racking up $55,000 bar tabs at Jimmy Buffet’s Margaritaville in the Bahamas. Kendall Jenner’s half-sister, Kim Kardashian, likewise found herself in the crosshairs of regulators and had to pay a $1.26 million fine for promoting ethereumMax – essentially, a pump-and-dump scheme. In a further twist of irony, the land in Great Exuma where Billy McFarland held Fyre is now being sold as non-fungible token (NFT) parcels, marketed towards crypto heads by the same developers behind Miami Beach’s Setai hotel.  Celebrities, and their managers who present advertising opportunities, owe a responsibility to fans and followers to properly vet products and services, and to actually understand what they’re promoting. While most builders in Web3 understand the risks of investing in cryptocurrency projects and have some lay of the land regarding DeFi architecture, it’s unlikely that Kim Kardashian's 228 million Instagram followers are well-versed in topics like portfolio allocation. They are sheep being led to the slaughter by someone who has never even ventured an opinion on Ethereum.  Celebrities, unfortunately, are only part of the problem with the current state of crypto marketing. An industry of Web3 YouTubers, Twitch streamers and TikTok stars emerged during the coronavirus pandemic. While most of these creators posted videos in good faith and wanted to share their passion for crypto and blockchain, there are, unfortunately, others who profited off retail, failing to disclose when they were paid to shill or when they took profits.  Read more: Jocelyn Yang - Read 'em and Weep: Five Crypto Influencers Who Dealt Their Followers a Bad Hand  To create a Web3 free of bad actors promoting pump-and-dump schemes, the incentive structures need to change for crypto marketing. While the U.S. Federal Trade Commission already requires individuals to disclose payments for promotions, Web3 is full of unproven startups, value propositions and teams requiring even greater accountability. Promoters in this space need to explain why they chose to align themselves with certain brands. Unlike skincare products or merchandise, cryptocurrencies directly impact financial markets and carry the risks for derivatives trading and contagion into other institutions. With all transactions visible on a public ledger, blockchain tech is built with transparency in mind. Those who tout the technology’s virtues should abide by this essential principle from both a legal and moral standpoint, and the industry needs to hold them accountable.  Crypto influencers, marketers and PR professionals need to spend more time digging into blockchain’s foundational architecture and uncovering their own ideology toward crypto and decentralization as a guiding force for selecting projects to endorse. Only by educating themselves first can they educate others. This statement should be obvious, but in the wake of the failed FTX and Celsius Network, the industry needs to adopt a “no tolerance” policy for promoters who blatantly hype brands without understanding or respecting the core technology.  As a first step, companies and influencers should begin measuring their social media reach for campaigns as a way to quantify their potential impact on financial markets and large population swaths. Oxygen has made it our mission to bring transparency to Web2 and Web3 growth marketing by using data analytics to understand creators and brands online, as well as relevant on-chain activity, to verify their legitimacy. We’ve also seen our partners in the industry such as CreatorDAO, a financing and technology platform assisting creators, play an active role in educating influencers on the best advertising practices to protect their audiences. By being transparent with who they are targeting, and how they are doing so, marketing teams will take an important step in embracing accountability.  Crypto marketing in 2023 will inevitably be defined by establishing new regulatory frameworks, but will also require embracing a new culture and attitudes. Those responsible for promoting crypto companies to the general public should be able to, at a minimum, articulate how their concept fits into the overall blockchain ecosystem – from protocol-level to consensus.  Those in positions of authority in Web3 (VCs, founders, etc.) can highlight individuals who promote companies from a place of good faith, acknowledge when they are wrong, and who get excited by the ideologies behind code – rather than the interchangeable brand associations of centralized vested interest groups.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Nemo Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/01/17/crypto-marketing-needs-to-change-lets-make-2023-the-year-for-influencer-accountability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d13ff215e19b5821f6542d68ba9d735699d256d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7687366,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516383,1673974830,"Bitcoin aSOPR Again Retests Bull-Bear Junction Level, Will Resistance Break This Time?","Data shows the Bitcoin Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR) is retesting the historical bull-bear junction. Will a break be found this time? Bitcoin aSOPR Is Currently Doing Another Rest Of 1.0 Level As per the latest weekly report from Glassnode, a successful retest here could suggest a meaningful regime shift in the BTC market. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (SOPR) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling their coins at a profit or at a loss right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the average holder in the market is moving coins at some profit currently. On the other hand, values below the threshold imply the overall market is realizing some loss at the moment. The SOPR being exactly equal to 1 naturally suggests that investors are just breaking even on their selling right now. A modified version of this indicator is the “Adjusted SOPR” (aSOPR), which filters out all selling of coins that was done within only an hour of said coins being first acquired. The main advantage of this modification is that it removes noise from the data that wouldn’t have any noticeable impacts on the market anyways. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day exponential moving average (EMA) Bitcoin aSOPR over the last couple of years: The 7-day EMA value of the metric seems to have gone up in recent days | Source: Glassnode's The Week Onchain - Week 3, 2023 As shown in the above graph, the 7-day EMA Bitcoin aSOPR has sharply risen recently and has reached the 1 level for the first time since the pre-FTX crash. This level has been historically significant for BTC, as the crypto has often encountered resistance at it during bear market periods. Related Reading: Why A Morning Star Reversal Could Awaken A Monster Bitcoin Rally The reason behind this is the fact that the aSOPR equal to 1 line represents the break-even mark. Whenever the metric increases to this mark, it means enough holders are back in a state of neutrality that they are able to recoup their investment. Psychologically, investors see this as getting their previously lost money “back” and hence large-scale dumping takes place here, thus providing impedance to the crypto’s price. Related Reading: Glassnode Points Out This Bizarre Consistency In Bitcoin Cycles A successful break above this level would suggest, however, that there is enough demand in the Bitcoin market right now that holders are able to realize their profits and buyers are present to absorb this selling. Because of this, such breaks have usually led to a transition from bear to bull markets. When bull markets take hold, the effect of the aSOPR 1 level flips, and the line instead starts providing support to the price of BTC. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $21,200, up 23% in the last week.

42414661,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD5eK,1673974533,"Crypto Developers Grew in Numbers Amid Bear Market, VC Firm Electric Capital Says","Blockchain, crypto, and Web3 developers continued to build out their ecosystems in 2022, even in the face of a brutal crypto winter, Electric Capital, a crypto venture capital firm, said in a new report.  Amid a significant drop in crypto prices in 2022, there was an 8% increase in year-to-year growth in full-time developers that worked on different blockchain ecosystems, according to the VC firm’s 2022 Electric Capital Developer Report. Last year also saw an all-time high of roughly 61,000 developers that contributed code for the first time, across all ecosystems.  Maria Shen, a partner at Electric Capital and the author of the study, told CoinDesk that the growth of developers in 2022 fell in line with similar patterns from previous bear market cycles, for example in 2018, full-time developers joined the industry to commit code to new ecosystems, despite all-time low cryptocurrency prices.  “Every single time we have one of these [bear market] cycles, we actually have a step function increase in the number of developers,” Shen said. “They come in, and then they stick around, despite prices dropping, which is amazing,” she added.  Shen said alternative ecosystems to Bitcoin and Ethereum are growing fast, and will be worth keeping an eye on in 2023.  In fact, only 28% of developers in 2022 contributed code to the Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems. Most developers worked on the other top 200 ecosystems. This means that most developers in the blockchain industry are working on building new emerging ecosystems that are not Ethereum and Bitcoin, even though the report shows that those two are the most mature ecosystems in the industry.  Some of these ecosystems that seem to be drawing more attention are communities on the Solana, Polygon, Cosmos, and Polkadot blockchains. Each community grew their total developers respectively by 83%, 40%, 25%, and 2%, in 2022, according to the report.  The emergence of new ecosystems is a sign that developers are experimenting with new technologies and building environments that are becoming more important in the crypto industry. “I think it's really, really remarkable that seven years ago, we had 1,000 monthly active developers and then over the past two years, 100,000 new developers just decided to take their head in and write some code,” Shen shared. “This is becoming a very significant open source community.”  Read more: Ethereum Far Outpaces Bitcoin in Developer Activity in 2020: Electric Capital Report",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/17/crypto-developers-grew-in-numbers-amid-bear-market-vc-firm-electric-capital-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a605cb4dbe16ad009b206c75c61652540b63c956-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The software upgrade occurred at 10:45 UTC (5:45 a.m. ET) on Tuesday, according to a tweet from Polygon Labs, the lead company behind the project.  The two proposals included in the hard fork were put forth in December. Some 87% of Polygon validator teams that participated voted for approval. Only 15 validator teams took part in the voting process, which is extremely low given the number of active validators at a time is limited to 100.  The first proposal adjusted a mechanism that sets gas fees – a kind of tax one pays in order to transact on a blockchain. The new mechanism aims to keep gas prices low when there is a lot of activity on the network.  The second proposal aims to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete a data block – part of an effort to prevent frequent reorgs, which occur when a validator node receives information that temporarily creates a new version of the blockchain.  The price of Polygon’s native token, MATIC, is up nearly 15% over the last seven days – in keeping with a broad rally in digital-asset markets.

Even the global crypto market cap is up by 0.11%, reflecting the rate at which most tokens are rallying over the past few days. A recent WhaleAlert report reveals massive XRP whale transfers happening amid the token’s price surge. The report showed the movement of nearly 429 million tokens (about $167 million) on multiple whale addresses in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: ETH Whales Scoop Up SAND – Up Nearly 80% – For Its Highly Bought Crypto Menu According to the WhaleAlert, the largest single whale transaction was a transfer of 209 million XRP worth approximately $81 million. The crypto whales added $49 million (about 123 million XRP) in multiple transactions. One whale address accumulated 94.3 million tokens ($38 million) in a transaction from Binance. XRP Makes Top 1,000 BSC Whales List Following Price Surge Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, XRP, has recorded a price increase of nearly 12% in the past seven days. Its trading volume has also added by 55% and is now at $1.3 billion. Despite the long-running lawsuit from the SEC against Ripple, XRP’s market cap remained unfazed, being over $19.5 billion. However, WhaleAlert recorded outflows of Ripple’s native coin on several whale addresses. Several whales moved 97 million of Ripple’s native coin worth approximately $37 million to the Bitstamp crypto exchange. Aside from the massive whale addresses activity, WhaleStats also reported that XRP tokens ranked the second largest cryptocurrency by dollar value held by the top 1,000 BSC (Binance Smart Chain) whales. The biggest BSC whale now holds about $27.6 million worth of the cryptocurrency. According to recent data, XRP secured its place on the top 10 purchased cryptocurrencies by the largest BSC whales. It also made the list of the most traded token by BSC whales. ChatGPT Gives Surprising XRP Price Prediction For March 2023 Meanwhile, Dr. Martin Hiesboeck, head of research at Uphold, recently shared a ChatGPT conversation on Ripple’s native coin via a tweet. ChatGPT is an AI model chatbot developed by OpenAI. It launched on November 2022. Martin Hiesboeck shared a snapshot of his conversation with the ChatGPT, where he asked the robot about XRP’s moon date. After refusing to answer initially, ChatGPT told the Uphold executive that Ripple’s native coin would moon on March 23, 2023. It also added what looked like a price prediction saying, “XRP to $589,000, up yours XRPP.” This response cracked members of Ripple’s native coin community up with laughter. Some community members responded with laughter emojis, while few saw it as a forecast that the XRP price might moon. Hiesboeck even wrote that the all-knowing AI ChatGPT has revealed when the token will moon after much persuasion. John Deaton, blockchain enthusiast and founder of CryptoLaw, also reacted to Hiesboeck’s post, citing what people said about the $589,000 price for Ripple’s native coin. Many predictions have suggested that the crypto may hit the $100 but deemed the $589,000 price unrealistic. Related Reading: Polkadot: Why Recent On-Chain Feats Could Trigger Strong Investor Sentiment Some say Ripple’s native coin would need to rally almost 200 million percent from its current price before reaching $589,000. However, most analysts might be waiting for the verdict of the Ripple/SEC lawsuit before making predictions. According to data from CoinGecko, Ripple’s native coin has gained 11.4% in the past seven days and 13.5% in the past 14 days. However, the token trades at $0.3876.

42414670,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD6Km,1673969400,"Solana Foundation, Ripple, GBBC and Others Form Partnership to Promote Crypto Solutions for Climate Change","DAVOS, Switzerland — Solana Foundation and Ripple are partnering with Eqo Networks, industry group Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), and blockchain-climate collective BxCi to accelerate the use of crypto-based solutions for climate change.  The newly founded non-profit organization, called Blockchain x Climate Leadership Network (BxC), aims to be the ""single largest common gathering of climate action innovators, leaders and builders under one global umbrella,"" according to a press statement shared with CoinDesk.  BxC's launch was announced at GBBC's gathering on the sidelines of the 2023 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos, Switzerland. The event, which gathers world leaders and top businesses in the Swiss Alps, attracted a slew of crypto entities to last year's meeting just ahead of the series of high-profile company collapses that left the industry scrambling to pick up the pieces.  This year, crypto's presence on the promenade outside the main forum center is comparatively muted, and the industry is making a concerted effort to attract attention to projects that have real-world applications and social benefit.  ""I think the climate use case makes the most sense in terms of real world utility beyond, let's say, speculative retail involvement,"" BxC strategic adviser Daniel Hwang told CoinDesk during an interview in Davos.  Hwang, who works on supporting the infrastructure ecosystem for the initiative, including carbon credit measurements, which calculates the reduced amount of greenhouse gases generated by human actions, said his team has been meeting every week for the last two and a half years hosting workshops and forums focused on education. The initiative looks to come up with principles of cooperation and best practices for climate-related blockchain efforts in different sectors, as well as business cases for climate-crypto projects.  Efforts of using crypto to support climate change mitigation efforts largely revolve around creating new economies that don't harm the environment.  The Solana Foundation and Ripple are two of the founding partners, whereas environmentally-oriented layer 1 blockchain Regen Network and association Climate Collective are supporting partners. GBBC, Eqo Networks, which specializes in creating such climate-minded leadership networks, and BxCi, formerly known as Blockchain Infrastructure Carbon Offset Working Group, will lead the initiative.  After BxC’s summer 2022 inception in Greenland, BxCi gathered representatives of major crypto and environmental organizations (including CoinDesk) in Colombia in autumn 2022. Some of the working groups that were formed in that meeting – working on carbon market registries, standards and auditability, policy development, regenerative finance and emerging markets in the global south – are still active today and will form the foundation of BxC.

42414667,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBD6AA,1673968897,Ethereum Startup Obol Labs Raises $12.5M to Decentralize Validators,"When Ethereum switched to proof-of-stake, its new system for processing transactions in September, it handed control of the network from crypto miners to validators.  In the midst of the crypto bear market, startup Obol Labs has raised $12.5 million in venture funding to build out distributed validator technology (DVT), a kind of tech that it believes solves some of the biggest pain points for Ethereum’s new validator class.  Among those on board with Obol Labs’ vision are crypto VC stalwarts Pantera Capital and Archetype, which co-led the series A round. Led by alums of Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys, Obol Labs has now raised a total of $19 million.  “DVT is a technology primitive that allows an Ethereum Proof-of-Stake validator to be run simultaneously on more than one node or machine,” Obol explained in a statement shared with CoinDesk. “The major breakthrough is the ability to split up a single validator key, making it possible for a group of people to share validation rights of an Ethereum validator.”  Validators, which earn rewards for operating the network of nodes that keeps Ethereum up and running, face challenges ranging from high capital requirements (you must “stake” 32 ETH to become a validator) and technical complexity (validators can pay penalties if they screw up or go offline).  Due to these barriers, power over the network has flowed into the hands of just a few big actors, including crypto exchanges Coinbase (Coinbase Ventures participated in the Obol series A) and Binance. Also among the largest validators is the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) Lido – a kind of validator collective that pools user funds and distributes them across a network of professional node operators.  Obol says it is already working with Lido and StakeWise, a similar service, to use DVT to more securely and efficiently distribute user funds across operators.  Coinbase, Binance and Lido have all faced scrutiny as of late due to concerns that if any of these parties gain enough control over the network, it could theoretically meddle with how it processes transactions.  In addition to providing software that can make outages and mishaps less likely for validators large and small, Obol thinks it will be able to ameliorate some of the issues with centralized control. “Today we think of validators as individuals or single entities,” Oisín Kyne, chief technology officer at Obol Labs told CoinDesk. “We think validators should actually be run by communities,"" he continued. ""Instead of only being able to run a validator alone, we want to enable you to run validators with a community of other stakers cooperatively.”  Obol is not the only company taking a swing at DVT. The concept – far from unique to any specific company – is included in the Ethereum road map shared by network co-founder Vitalik Buterin, with “distributed validators” included as a core ingredient for ensuring a successful proof-of-stake network.

7683650,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516377,1673967630,Myth Buster: Ethereum Shanghai Hard Fork Won’t Create Major Selling Pressure,"With the “Merge”, the Ethereum blockchain successfully mastered the biggest upgrade in its history on September 15 last year. Even before the switch to Proof of Stake (PoS), investors were able to stake ETH to receive rewards. However, the prerequisite was that a minimum of 32 ETH had to be staked and could not be accessed until the next upgrade, meaning the ETH could be unstaked. This changes with the Shanghai hard fork, which is tentatively scheduled for March this year. As NewsBTC reported, the upgrade is not only causing excitement, but also concern that large investors may dump their ETH on the market when they can get their hands on their tokens for the first time in over two years, in some cases. However, the narrative of a dump is a myth as most people still don’t know how the exit queue works. Researcher Westie posted a thread via Twitter to explain the mechanism. According to him, the withdrawal period on Ethereum works dynamically and is not static like on other PoS networks (where there is a fixed withdrawal period for stakers, which on Cosmos, for example, is set at 21 days). This Is Why An Ethereum Dump Won’t Happen The period depends on how many validators drop out at a given time. In addition, Ethereum validators who exit the validator set must go through two stages: the exit queue and the withdrawal period. The initial queue is determined by the number of all validators and the quotient of the churn limit, set at 2^16 (65,536). Assuming there are 500,000 validators, the churn limit would be set at 7 according the analysis: 500,000 / 65,536 = 7.62, which rounds down to 7. This means that as the number of ETH validators increases, the churn limit also increases. It increases by 1 in each interval of 65536 (above the minimum threshold). Once a validator has successfully passed through the exit queue, the validator must also wait for a queue time based on when the validator is slashed. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Gearing For Lift-Off to $1,800: Rally Isn’t Over Yet “If the Ethereum validator was not slashed, this withdrawal period would take 256 epochs (~27 hours) If they were slashed, it would take 8,192 epochs (~36 days). This large discrepancy is meant to disincentive bad actors,” according to the analyst. Based on these parameters, Westie concludes: If ⅓ of the entire validator set were to try and exit in one day, it would take at least 97 days to complete. To expect the same withdrawal time as most Cosmos chains, 21 days, it would take between 6.3% and 7.2% of the validator set to be in the exit queue at one time. Nevertheless, the calculation is only an estimate. As the analyst explains, forecasting is difficult. However, there is a high chance that the queue will be very long at first, 70 days or more, because there is recycling of validators, according to the researcher. Related Reading: Ethereum Hits Monthly High And Turns Deflationary Again The reason for this is that large players need to change their current Ethereum participation situation, as many of the practices from two years ago are now outdated – with better staking solutions available. “However, over time I expect it to converge to a small but sustainable amount. I don’t expect the withdrawal period to be as large as Cosmos’ over a long enough time period, but we will certainly get a better gauge once the withdrawals are live,” the researcher says. For the Ethereum price, this means that the chance of a dump because all stakers sell their ETH at the same time is close to zero. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,568, approaching the crucial weekly resistance around $1,600.

7682725,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516350,1673965823,"Here’s Why $22,400 Could Be The Next Major Level To Break For Bitcoin","As Bitcoin continues its strong rally, $22,400 could be the level to watch next, if this on-chain metric is anything to go by. Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Realized Price Is Currently Around $22,400 According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, BTC broke through all three realized prices of the market back in April 2019. To understand the concept of “realized price,” the realized cap needs to be looked at first. The realized cap is a capitalization model for BTC that values each coin in circulation at the price it was last transacted. This is different from the usual market cap, which puts the value of all tokens at the same current price of Bitcoin. When the market cap is divided by the total number of coins in circulation, the BTC price is obtained, a fact that isn’t unexpected at all, as the market cap is calculated by multiplying the price by the number of coins to start with. However, if this same idea is applied to the realized cap (that is if it’s divided by the number of coins), a sort of “realized price” can be derived. The significance of this price is that it’s the cost basis of the average holder in the Bitcoin market. The implication of this is that if the (normal) price of BTC declines under this realized price, the average investor can be thought to have entered into a state of loss. Related Reading: Glassnode Points Out This Bizarre Consistency In Bitcoin Cycles All investors in the market can be divided into two major cohorts: the “short-term holders” (STHs) and the “long-term holders” (LTHs). The former includes investors who acquired their coins less than 155 days ago, while the latter consists of holders who have been holding their coins for more than that period. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the realized price for the entire Bitcoin market, as well as that for the STHs and LTHs, over the last five years: Looks like the value of the crypto has broken past all but one of these metrics | Source: Glassnode The Week Onchain - Week 3, 2023 As shown in the above graph, the BTC price had been below all three of these realized prices for much of the bear market, suggesting that the average Bitcoin investor in all the cohorts was carrying an unrealized loss. However, in the most recent rally, the crypto has so far managed to break above the STH cost basis ($18,000), as well as that of the entire market ($19,700). The LTH realized price of about $22,400 is yet to be reached by the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Show Signs Of Dumping, Bad For Rally? A similar rally took place back in April 2019, which marked the end of the 2018-2019 bear market. But in that rally, Bitcoin managed to rise above all three of the realized prices. If a similar transition is truly taking place in this bear market as well, then the $22,400 level could be the one to watch for next, as a break above it could imply a return towards a bullish regime. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $21,100, up 22% in the last week.

With the token’s support at $0.2365 broken, ALGO investors should be able to buy the current dip in price as analysts are still bullish with the token’s price movement. With improving macro trends, investors and traders are more likely to enter riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Not to mention that Bitcoin, the face of the crypto market, has broken through crucial resistance at $21k. With ALGO’s high correlation to BTC, ALGO can ride Bitcoin’s rally to reach higher highs.

In its Web3 Development Report looking at the fourth quarter of 2022, Alchemy wrote that this past year saw token trading drop but development on Ethereum grow. Non-fungible token (NFT) trading volume was down by 94% year over year, the report said, while the total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols fell by 77%. Major cryptocurrencies, including BTC, ETH and SOL, dropped by 65%, 68% and 94% respectively.  And while the fallout from FTX’s collapse in November led to significant losses that rippled across industries, morale amongst Web3 developers remains high. The number of smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum mainnet increased by 453%, the report said, following the Ethereum merge at the end of the third quarter. And in a survey of 985 developers conducted by Alchemy, 94.2% reported feeling optimistic about the future of Web3.  “Web3’s hallmark highs and lows were on full display in Q4,” Alchemy wrote in a press release accompanying the report. “On one hand, developers leaned into trustlessness – deploying smart contracts at rates that resembled the peaks of 2021. On the other, the implosion of major crypto exchanges rocked the foundations of consumer trust.”  Jason Shah, head of growth at Alchemy, told CoinDesk that while the fall of FTX contributed to the sharp decline in some figures last quarter, positive developer sentiment highlights a growing separation between cryptocurrencies and decentralized tools.  “It’s the tale of two cryptos, with centralized exchanges and financial fraud alongside builders and decentralized technological architecture,” said Shah. “And these are very different worlds, frankly, that are becoming increasingly decoupled.”  Shah also noted that among the smart contracts deployed this past quarter, there was 58% increase in the amount of social decentralized applications (dapps) built in the fourth quarter.  “It suggests to us that there's probably a more sustainable and natural set of internet products that are being built around that social sector,” said Shah.

Zhu and Davies partnered with Mark Lamb and Sudhu Arumugam, co-founders of crypto exchange CoinFlex, to raise $25 million for a new exchange called GTX, a platform where users can trade crypto, stocks and debt claims on bankrupt companies like FTX. The crypto community was quick to convey its skepticism. Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy was one of the prominent critics. ""If you are investing into coinflex/3ac 'exchange' you might find it a bit more difficult to work with Wintermute in future (on the relationship building side),"" he said in a tweet on Monday.  The digital yuan, or e-CNY, a token issued by the Bank of China, has been used to buy securities for the first time according to a local media outlet on Monday. Now investors can use the e-CNY to buy securities using the Soochow Securities mobile app. China's is further along than most other countries in developing a central bank digital currency. Last week, the country included the e-CNY in cash circulation for the first time. Around the same time, it also added a function to its e-CNY payment app that allowed users to make payments offline, according to media outlet Yicai Global.  BNB Chain, launched by crypto exchange Binance, has completed the burn of over $500 million worth of its native BNB tokens as part of a broader program, it said Tuesday. Token burn refers to the process of permanent deletion of coins from their circulating supply. More than 100 million BNB, or half of its total supply, are intended to be removed from circulation through a burning process and to eventually keep only 100 million BNB in circulation. BNB was up nominally in the past 24 hours, trading at $300 on Tuesday morning.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of bitcoin held in addresses owned by over-the-counter (OTC) desks.  The tally has increased by 70% to 5,293 BTC since Jan. 11.  ""Higher OTC Desk holdings imply that institutional investors' demand for bitcoin has increased as these OTC trading desks are usually used by investors who perform large-scale transactions that need high liquidity on a bilateral basis,"" André Dragosch, head of Deutsche Digital Assets, said.  Private wealth managers, high-net-worth individuals or hedge funds wishing to convert large amounts of cash into crypto assets seamlessly typically use OTC desks.  – Omkar Godbole     Trending Posts  European Union Postpones MiCA Vote to April  Crypto Lender Vauld Gets Another Extension for Submitting Restructuring Plan: Bloomberg  Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down, but Not Out",NEUTRAL,BTC | BNB,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/17/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-tops-21k-outshines-sp-500-gold,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a41df05a738cb17e63b8d66a7c81c101b2aa47b4-1620x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7680152,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516382,1673961008,DeFi Begins Recovery As TVL Exceeds $45 Billion,"Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has always been the most evolving sector in the Web3 space. With new innovations and protocols popping up in the DeFi industry, the ecosystem total value locked (TVL) continued to increase until the bear market stepped in. The bear cycle caused a lot of downturns in many sectors of the We3 industry including DeFi. However, following the ongoing so-called ‘mini bull run,’ we’ve seen DeFi TVL start to recover from the lower lows and surge by nearly 20% since the beginning of the year. DeFi TVL Surges Nearly 20% According to data from DeFiLlama, DeFi TVL has exceeded $45 billion — its highest point in the past two months. Major DeFi protocols such as Lido Finance and MakerDAO played a significant role in the DeFi TVL rise. Lido has amassed double-digit gains over the past week, adding $8.4 billion to the DeFi ecosystem since its lower low late last year. Though the TVL rise appears to be mirroring the crypto rally as most of the underlying DeFi tokens have also followed suit in the bullish trend, one thing worth noting is that DeFi TVL is still very far from its all-time high seen in 2021. Notably, Liquid staking protocol like Lido Finance is the accelerator of the DeFi ecosystem surge, having the largest DeFi market share with 14.75% dominance and leaving the former king of DeFi, MakerDAO, behind with a share of 13.25%, according to DeFiLlama. As reported by NewsBTC, the reason behind the rapid increase in the momentum of Lido is the Ethereum Merge, which triggered the popularity of liquid staking protocols such as Lido Finance. Following the merge, the total ETH stake in Lido increased 10% from 4.43 million ETH on September 15, 2022, the date of the merge, to over 4.8 million ETH today. Related Reading: Lido DAO (LDO) Token Outperforms Market With 62% Weekly Gains Other Accelerator Of The DeFi TVL Rise Aside from Lido’s aid in the DeFi TVL surge, the high-throughput layer-1 blockchain network, Algorand, has also been an assistant following its 123% spike over the past week. It currently has $176 million in TVL, with five of the top six leading DeFi protocols on the network having done significant percentages in gains over the past 7 days. AlgoFi is up 121% in the last 7 days. Folks Finance is up 490%, Pact 136%, and GARD 202%, driving massive momentum into the ecosystem. Related Reading: Uniswap Tops Other Big Crypto In Social Dominance Despite Price Drop Aave and Uniswap have always contributed greatly to the DeFi ecosystem TVL, with Aave recording over 10% in gains in the last 7 days and Uniswap recording nearly 7% in gains over the same period. Regarding blockchain, Ethereum is still the top dog with the largest share in the DeFi TVL. Ethereum has a DeFi market share of over 50%, with a TVL of $27.16 billion. ETH has amassed significant gains in its value in the past few days amid the global market rally. ETH finally broke the $1,300 zone and has climbed to a higher high above $1,500. Though ETH is still far from its peak, the second-largest crypto by market cap is striving to reach its ATH and beyond.

However, in 2023, BTC has picked up positive price momentum, with some investors believing the worst days are over. Ched’s prediction is bullish on the performance of BTC in the future.

He stated that Bitcoin might see a bullish reversal. In his words, above $18,200 opens up the possibility of an inverse head and shoulders complex, multiple shoulders and head with neck base at $25,500. His optimistic forecast has Bitcoin soaring up to the $37,000 level, which will be a 76% increase from its current value. He suggested that fear of missing out (FOMO) will drive more traders to chase BTC rallies. Bitcoin also closed above its 200-day moving average. Ched labeled this move a sign of BTC’s strength. He believes the altcoins will also spark to life once Bitcoin and Ethereum slow down to consolidate their positions. Tim Draper, a BTC bull, was more optimistic about the price movement of Bitcoin. His analysis predicted that Bitcoin would be worth $250,000 by the end of 2023. While the figures seem outrageous, he stated that Bitcoin would enjoy increased adoption in retail spending. Draper emphasized that only one in seven BTC wallets belongs to a woman. He expects more women to adopt BTC wallets. Standard Chartered bank held a more pessimistic view. In their forecast, Bitcoin might sink to around $5,000. They also stated that as more exchanges battle financial issues and bankruptcy, the prices will decline. According to their forecast, these financial issues will erode investors’ confidence in digital assets. What Is Behind The Crypto Resurgence? The crypto market has improved its outlook, with BTC leading the market. Although experts vary in their forecasts and predictions, several factors have led to this positive turn of events in 2023. Generally, the financial markets correlate with the American economy. For example, in 2022, inflation rates increased as well as a rise in unemployment rates. The forex and stock markets felt the impact of these rate adjustments, with cryptocurrencies following suit. But the recent inflation data for December showed a decline which may have spiked crypto prices. Also, cryptocurrencies now enjoy wider adoption and acceptance despite regulations in certain regions. They serve as a faster means for processing payments, and their utility has soared recently. Technological advancements like Web3 have also played a part as most crypto projects look to join this trend. These factors have also boosted the prices of crypto assets. Bitcoin (BTC) Short Or Long? BTC is above the $21k level and has continued its positive price trend in 2023. However, traders might be skeptical about BTC wondering if it is a bull run or a bull trap.

42413094,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7pEc,1673957872,Bank of America Says CBDCs Are the Future of Money and Payments,"Digital currencies, such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and stablecoins, are the natural evolution of money and payments, Bank of America said in a research report on Tuesday.  “CBDCs do not change the definition of money, but will likely change how and when value is transferred over the next 15 years,” analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote, adding that central bank digital currencies have “the potential to revolutionize global financial systems and may be the most significant technological advancement in the history of money.”  CBDCs typically use blockchain technology to increase efficiency and lower costs. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  The benefits and risks of CBDCs depend on their design and issuance, but Bank of America expects central banks in developed economies to focus on payments efficiency and those on developing countries to focus on financial inclusion.  Still, CBDCs aren't without their risks. They may drive competition with bank deposits, and could lead to a loss of monetary sovereignty and inequality among countries globally, the note said.  CBDC issuance may not happen for over a decade in some counties, but central banks are expected to “adopt technological advances or risk irrelevance over the longer term,” the note added.  Bank of America says it expects central banks and governments will drive digital-asset innovation with input from the private sector.

For all of 2022, the company posted a loss of $949 million, compared with net income of $75.5 million in 2021.  Silvergate's results for the latest quarter were foreshadowed at the start of January when the company said it had $8.1 billion in outflows of customers' deposits of digital assets during the period and that it had slashed 40% of its staff. The firm expects to incur restructuring charges of $8.1 million for the layoffs, the majority of which it will recognize this quarter.  Furthermore, Silvergate recorded a $134.5 million impairment charge related to $1.7 billion of securities it expects to sell this quarter as it attempts to counter the huge amount of outflows at the end of last year.  Silvergate was rocked by contagion from the collapse of crypto firms last year that came to a head in November with the demise of crypto exchange FTX.  The bank's shares on the New York Stock Exchange were up 4.9% at $13.85 in premarket trading, while bitcoin (BTC) was up 1.7% at $21,235. Silvergate's stock has lost almost 90% over the past year.

The Bernstein analysts said post-FTX they expect a jump in “crypto custody penetration” with existing investors and a sharp growth in custody services in the medium term driven by increased institutional participation in digital-asset markets.  The broker said there is a large revenue opportunity for crypto firms and banks to provide Wall Street-like custody, market-making and prime brokerage services to new crypto investors.  Market making is expected to increase as institutional participation grows and with it demand for liquidity in large-cap coins and less popular tokens, the note said. A market maker is a firm that provides liquidity for an asset or security.  Institutional crypto investors will also need prime brokerage services such as over-the-counter trading desks, derivatives, lending and other structured products, and Bernstein estimates that this could grow to a $14 billion revenue opportunity by 2033.

Due to an opaque proof of reserves, the withdrawal of accounting firm Mazars, and a bank run on the exchange, the Binance Coin (BNB) suffered a temporary loss of trust and excessive price losses. Slowly and gradually, however, investors seem to be regaining confidence in Binance. The BNB price has risen 9.3% over the last seven days, reaching $301 at press time. Although there was some positive news from Binance yesterday and today, the BNB price is facing a bearish pattern on the weekly chart. The pattern usually predicts a trend reversal and shows three peaks, with the two outer ones close to each other and the middle peak being the highest. The left shoulder forms when investors drive the price up, and then temporarily lose their enthusiasm. The head builds up when enthusiasm reaches its peak. The right shoulder forms when the price rises again, but does not reach its previous peak before falling again. Related Reading: Why A Morning Star Reversal Could Awaken A Monster Bitcoin Rally The head of the BNB weekly chart was formed in the week when FTX filed for bankruptcy. In the following weeks, the price fell before BNB experienced a recent rally thanks to the generally bullish market sentiment. With this, BNB is in a crucial scenario. If BNB breaks the neckline at $210 to the downside, the chart pattern could validate and BNB could see a downtrend within the next few weeks, pushing the price toward $153. Binance Coin Counts On Strong Fundamentals There are also good fundamental reasons to be bullish on the BNB price. The crypto exchange announced its 22nd quarterly burn today. As part of it, the exchange has burned 7,181.03 BNB via the Pioneer Burn Program, which was equivalent to about $617 million. Related Reading: What Matters In Crypto This Week: Will Bitcoin Keep Pumping? In total, Binance has now burned approximately 2.06 million BNB. With the latest quarterly burn, the exchange has burned about 1.28% of all BNB in circulation, which is the highest in almost two years. This shows that Binance’s trading business is again doing better than in previous months. #Binance completes 22nd quarterly #BNB burn! 🔥 2.06m #BNB has been burned 🔥 pic.twitter.com/21v9R7H78K — Binance (@binance) January 17, 2023 In other bullish news, the exchange yesterday launched a new off-exchange custody service that allows institutions to access trading and investment products within the exchange ecosystem without having to deposit collateral directly on the exchange: We’re excited to announce the official launch of our off-exchange settlement solution, Binance Mirror. Through Mirror, institutions can deploy their liquidity on Binance while their assets remain secured in our segregated cold storage. As the exchange explained, assets in Binance Mirror account for more than 60% of all assets secured in the custody product. With the new service, the exchange could hope for increased adoption by institutions that previously did not want to take the risk of third-party custody, but at the same time want to access the most liquid exchange in the market. According to the exchange, the adoption of Binance Mirror increased significantly in the last quarter of 2022 with a 67% increase in assets mirrored from Binance Custody to the exchange.

""MiCA is tabled to be voted by the plenary in April and to my knowledge, the delay is technical, caused by translating issues,"" an official familiar with the matter said.  EU procedures require legal acts such as MiCA, which was negotiated in English, to be available in all the bloc's 24 official languages.  In November, the EU delayed the vote until February, and CoinDesk reported then that technical issues in the lengthy text could delay the start of the licensing regime, which was expected to go into effect in 2024.  EU officials said MiCA would have prevented the mismanagement at crypto exchange FTX, which collapsed in November. But the legislation, CoinDesk reported, has a major loophole in which companies such as FTX based outside the EU would be able to serve EU customers without extra regulation.  Read more: EU’s MiCA Law May Have an FTX-Shaped Loophole  European legislators have agreed upon the law in principle, but the almost 400-page text needs to be formally signed off by both lawmakers and national governments that make up the EU's Governing Council.

MiCA introduces the first-ever common licensing regime for crypto wallets and exchanges to operate across the EU to serve its population of 450 million, and it has a reserve requirement for stablecoin issuers.

Vauld has received bids from two digital-asset fund managers to take over the beleaguered lender, according to the report, which cited a person familiar with the matter.  The firm suspended withdrawals, trading and deposits on its platform last July, after which it filed for creditor protection in Singapore. It initially had until Jan. 20 to work on a restructuring plan.  For several months fellow crypto lender Nexo was the front-runner to acquire Vauld . Those talks, however, appear to have broken down after Vauld said the deal wouldn't be in its creditors' best interests.  As of July 8 last year, Vauld owed $402 million to creditors, 90% of which originated from individual retail investor deposits. Indian authorities froze assets worth 3.7 billion rupees ($46.4 million) a month after it filed for creditor protection.  Vauld didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

42413107,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7pOu,1673950318,"Buyers From Coinbase Powered Bitcoin Higher, or Did They?","The price of bitcoin (BTC) has gained nearly 28% this month, hitting its highest since early November. The popular narrative on Crypto Twitter is that traders from Coinbase (COIN) have powered the cryptocurrency higher. However, the Nasdaq-listed exchange hasn't been the only source of bullish pressures for the cryptocurrency.  The Coinbase premium index, which measures the spread between Coinbase's BTC/U.S. dollar (USD) pair and Binance's BTC/USDT pair involving the tether stablecoin, turned positive last week and rose to 0.039 over the weekend, the highest since late October, per data sourced from blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant.  In other words, the indicator suggests the buying pressure on Coinbase has been relatively stronger.  ""The price premium between Bitcoins traded on Coinbase vis-a-vis those traded on Binance (Coinbase-Binance premium) continued to be positive throughout the week, which is indicative of increased buying interest from institutional investors vis-a-vis retail investors,"" Andre Dragosch, head of Deutsche Digital Assets, wrote in a note to clients.  Institutions prefer publicly traded and regulated Coinbase over offshore entities like Binance, which are considered a proxy for retail investor participation. Binance is now taking steps to establish itself as an institutional-focused platform.  However, another indicator called the cumulative volume delta (CVD), which measures the net capital inflows into the market, suggests the rally began with Binance-based entities bidding for bitcoin with BUSD, a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Binance and Paxos, in the perpetual futures market. And buyers from Coinbase and other exchanges joined the fray later.  A rising CVD means more buyers are in action, while a negative-sloping line implies there are more sellers.  The chart sourced from Coinalyze.net and tweeted by pseudonymous analyst exitpump (@exitpumpBTC) compares the cumulative volume delta (CVD) for BTC/BUSD pair listed on Binance (yellow line) with the CVD BTC/USD and BTC/USDT pairs listed on other exchanges and Binance.  The yellow line has been trending upwards since Jan. 11, while the green line began rising three days later. In other words, bitcoin's initial increase from $17,000 was mainly fueled by solid bidding in Binance's BTC/BUSD market while buyers from other exchanges, including Coinbase, stepped in later.  ""From my observations, it was mostly one entity [from Binance] bidding and absorbing sell pressure and trying to make a breakout market buying and constantly eating the sell walls with no signs of exhaustion, which lead to short squeezes pumping the price,"" exitpump tweeted.  Meanwhile, other metrics, like the average trade size, suggest an absence of clear leadership and an across-the-board uptick in whale activity.  ""Regarding the average trade size, there has been a notable increase on Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex and LMAX Digital and a slight increase on most other exchanges, including Binance, which suggest more whale-driven price action,"" Clara Medalie, research director at Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko, told CoinDesk in an email.  The average trade size on Binance has increased from $700 to $1,100 since Jan. 8.  Bitcoin changed hands at around $21,150 at press time, having risen nearly 22% last week. The rally stemmed from the belief that worse macroeconomic risks may be behind us.  ""It's not just the acceptance that peak inflation is behind us and that rates probably don't have that much further to rise. It's also that most sellers have been flushed out of the market,"" Noelle Acheson, author of the popular ""Crypto Is Macro Now"" newsletter, said in the weekend's edition of the newsletter, explaining the price rally.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/01/17/buyers-from-coinbase-powered-bitcoin-higher-or-did-they,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8326c2db7d9b9e2baf8da72132716d4c1e4abbc-1438x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

7672872,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516331,1673947109,Bitcoin 25% Climb Signals Recovery In Crypto Market – Will BTC Soar Higher This Week?,"After a strong week for bitcoin (BTC) and many other leading cryptocurrencies, traders are now on the lookout for indicators of what could spark the next bull run. After being battered by losses for the majority of 2022, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are on the rise in 2023, leading to predictions that the so-called crypto winter has thawed. Bitcoin has begun the new year on a bright note. On Saturday, Bitcoin surpassed $21,000 for the first time in 60 days. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $21,090, up 25% in the last seven days, data by Coingecko show. Image: Watcher Guru Bitcoin Could Still Climb Higher If this week’s US economic data shows that the Federal Reserve may be nearing the end of its interest rate hikes, the prices of major cryptocurrencies could soar. Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda, wrote on Friday: “Wall Street is very confident that the end of the central bank’s tightening cycle is upon us and that is providing some underlying support for crypto.” The most recent Bitcoin rise is still a far cry from the alpha coin’s November 2021 record high of $68,990. However, this has provided market participants with enthusiasm. Related Reading: ETH Whales Scoop Up SAND – Up Nearly 80% – For Its Highly Bought Crypto Menu The whole cryptocurrency market lost over $1.4 trillion in value last year because of liquidity troubles, bankruptcies, and the collapse of crypto exchange powerhouse, FTX. It didn’t take long for the so-called “contagion” to make its presence felt in all corners of the crypto market after the wave of insolvencies. Bitcoin dropped to a two-year low of $15,480 as the FTX epidemic engulfed the cryptocurrency market. Whale Accumulation Boosts BTC Price This spike in Bitcoin’s value is likely fueled by a number of causes. There is a rising expectation among market participants that the Federal Reserve would follow a more benign monetary policy by halting interest rate hikes or decreasing rates in the near future, possibly as early as the end of this year. Last year, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times, sending risky assets such as equities and tech stocks to slide.

Cryptocurrency whales, or crypto whales, are persons or organizations that possess enormous amounts of a particular cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, although bitcoin has gained a nice boost at the beginning of 2023, in conjunction with risk assets as mentioned above, market observers say the leading coin is unlikely to retest its all-time high of $69,000, but it may have reached a bottom.

42410884,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggsDKU,1673945310,Davos 2023: Crypto Is Down but Not Out,"DAVOS, Switzerland — The crypto industry showed up in force at the World Economic Forum’s annual conference in May 2022.  Eight months, numerous bankruptcies and a major collapse later, the industry is still present in Davos, Switzerland, but with a more subdued presence. The Promenade – the road outside the main Congress Centre – still has a number of crypto companies advertising or operating “houses,” the lounges, meeting rooms or event stages meant to introduce Davos attendees to their projects.  But there are far fewer companies present. Those that remain include Circle, the Global Blockchain Business Council, Casper Labs and the Filecoin Foundation. Where in 2022 crypto panels were everywhere, in 2023 the crypto industry blends seamlessly into the major financial and tech giants around them. Gone are the free bitcoin-themed pizza stalls and high-volume advertising to the casual passerby.  “What a difference eight months makes,” said Ripple Senior Vice President Brooks Entwistle. “You couldn’t walk more than five or 10 feet without seeing a crypto house [in 2022].”  The market may have some role here. Entwistle said that many of the crypto projects advertising or operating houses in 2022 likely booked them well in advance, considering the forum’s annual meeting was originally set for January 2022 but was delayed due to a spike in COVID-19 cases worldwide. In other words, these companies likely booked their houses and advertisements while the crypto industry was still in its last bull market.  In contrast, 2023 bookings likely occurred after prices began to fall, leading to tightened budgets that may account for the much smaller presence this year.  “Since we were here in May we’ve seen a lot of turmoil,” Entwistle said. ""There's no [non-fungible token] galleries ... we're here to work and have conversations.""  Those who remain aren’t daunted. Marta Belcher, the Filecoin Foundation’s head of policy, told CoinDesk that she believed there was less noise at the event this year, allowing for more conversations focused on the actual technology at hand.  “It’s too soon to tell what the reception is like, but the responses [so far] has been encouraging,” she said.  Main event  As in years past, crypto has a presence within the main forum’s own conference, with a number of panels addressing different aspects of the industry – but specifically focused on a narrow set of topics: central bank digital currencies, digital identities, tokenized economies and the like.  The official conference kicks off Tuesday morning in Switzerland. Unofficially, the crypto industry began holding its own events on Monday, with Circle, the Global Blockchain Business Council, Casper Labs and the Filecoin Foundation all hosting panels addressing everything from FTX (Sam Bankman-Fried is a “fraud,” alleged Skybridge Capital founder Anthony Scaramucci) to whether central bank digital currencies make sense. (“I actually don't think central bank digital currencies are the solution,” said historian Niall Ferguson.)  What may be more unexpected is the fact that regulators and policymakers are actively participating in these panels. Multiple United Nations representatives spoke about their work in a panel on blockchain use by public institutions hosted by the GBBC (and moderated by the GBBC's Summer Singh), alongside Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero and Johannes Duong, of the Oesterreichischen Nationalbank (Austria’s central bank).  Advit Nath, of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), a United Nations agency, said his group was actively using blockchain tools to track the flow of donated funds in certain regions. Goldsmith Romero praised the fact that blockchains inherently record every transaction, making it relatively easy for her agency to establish whether it has jurisdiction over certain transactions and crimes and just use market surveillance tools in general.  The events hosted by crypto companies are also seeing solid attendance. Casper Labs had a packed house on Monday evening, and a reception hosted by Filecoin was standing room only.  And for all that, it's unclear just what the industry can take away after this week. Entwistle told CoinDesk that he and his colleagues were mainly at the conference to meet with potential clients.  ""Our approach here has been to be tactical about meetings,"" he said, part of the reason why Ripple doesn't host a house of its own.  Jonathan Dotan of Starling Labs echoed Entwistle's comments, saying that at least from his perspective ""very little has changed.""  Starling Labs doesn't offer anything resembling financial services, Dotan said, and so hasn't had to deal with the fallout from the crypto crash the way other companies may have.  And Davos is, after all, largely a forum to make connections and find possible investors or customers.  FTX's shadow  Of course, the FTX-shaped elephant in the room also likely has had an impact on crypto's relatively toned-down presence at Davos this year.  Conversations are being hijacked by discussions about FTX's collapse, and panels are at the least touching on the exchange's fall, Entwistle said.  The industry was sent reeling after FTX fell apart, and the amount of interplay between different now-bankrupt crypto lenders sparked fears of widespread contagion. So far, this contagion has been limited to within the industry itself, though regulators have warned in the past that contagion between crypto and the broader financial market is an area of concern.  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire, who spoke with Ferguson on a panel hosted by the Financial Times, said the industry’s path to recovery included differentiating between good and bad actors.  “We need to differentiate speculative assets that don't have any real utility or value from digital assets that are designed to have utility. We need to differentiate between the regulated and the unregulated,” he said.  A lack of guardrails will continue to prevent more traditional institutions from considering engaging with cryptocurrencies, said New York Stock Exchange President Lynn Martin.  “Look at the issues in the last few months in particular, with the FTX bankruptcy … More traditional financial models … have been shown to be the beacons of transparency,” she said. “We need the regulators to tell us what the guideposts are. What the regulated framework is to bring them into more traditional structures, and ways of execution.”  Goldsmith Romero, speaking on her panel, said it was also contingent on Congress to pass legislation clarifying the roles U.S. regulators may hold.  The Davos contingent of the crypto industry may provide a snapshot glance at whether this differentiation will occur.  Scaramucci, speaking on his panel, said he would “probably make that mistake” of trusting someone like FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried again.  “I’m not going to stop the risk-taking,” he said.  Jack Schickler and Sandali Handagama contributed reporting.

Token burn refers to the process of permanent deletion of coins from their circulating supply. Over 100 million BNB, or half of its total supply, are intended to be removed from circulation through a burning process and to eventually keep only 100 million BNB in circulation.

The BNB Auto-Burn provides an independently auditable, objective process. The figures are reported quarterly, and the mechanism is independent of the Binance centralized exchange. BNB Chain still continues to burn a portion of BNB Chain’s gas fees in real-time using a bespoke mechanism.  The auto-burn mechanism adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter. BNB powers the BNB Chain ecosystem and is the native coin of the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. It was issued by crypto exchange Binance after an initial coin offering in 2017.

42413088,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl7p90,1673944355,Crypto White Hat Platform Immunefi Banned 15 ChatGPT-Generated Bug Reports. Here's Why,"OpenAI’s ChatGPT has stirred the hornet’s nest since its launch, with the Twitterverse readily commenting on how the software could eventually create code, write stories, steal jobs and even fight wildfires.  But the crypto platform Immunefi is having none of that. The bounty-paying white hat – a term for individuals who hack products with the goal of patching security instead of theft – banned 15 users last week who submitted ChatGPT-regenerated reports on the platform, albeit to mixed sentiment.  Immunefi developers told CoinDesk that the platform’s reasoning on the subject is crystal clear for now.  “There’s a difference between something like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT. With the former, you are driving the process and the role of Copilot is offering useful suggestions in context, which you accept or reject as you write your program,” Immunefi told CoinDesk in a Twitter message. “With the latter, you are using a single prompt to generate something that looks like a well-written bug report, but is nonsense when analyzed further.”  “This wastes the white hat’s time, Immunefi’s time and the projects’ time. That’s why we ban ChatGPT reports,” they added.  “It’s really an art,” developers further said, referring to the act of carefully writing a well-crafted bug report that clearly lays out issues and solutions for any exploit or bug.  Immunefi went a step ahead and asked ChatGPT itself why the software shouldn’t be used for generating bug reports, to a “satisfying response.”  The bug bounty platform has over $135 million in rewards available for white hats who find out vulnerabilities on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. It claims to have paid out more than $60 million in bounties and says the service has saved an estimated $25 billion in user funds.  As such, Immunefi said it would continue to monitor ChatGPT-generated reports even as they eventually get more sophisticated. “There are a lot of very obvious tells. If you play around with ChatGPT, you’ll start to see a lot of patterns in the output,” developers said.  “For example, no regular white hat would go out of their way to waste their time submitting a long, nicely written and well-structured bug report that has no relation to a project’s smart contracts at all,” they added.  But that’s not to say they would ever not consider unbanning the use of AI-generated bug reports in the future.  “We will keep an eye out for the development of AI tools, and we will consider unbanning their use if they are ever capable of generating real bug reports.” For now, however, it’s ban time.",NEUTRAL,없음,TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/01/17/crypto-whitehat-platform-immunefi-banned-15-chatgpt-generated-bug-reports-heres-why,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f90d498f248160b6bb22cfbc7ae8e8ba635931c6-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In other words, there would be no restrictions on the types of goods and services to be purchased or on the time for use of the digital euro.  This was just one of several views stated by the Eurogroup after its meeting to take stock of the progress of the digital euro, the bloc's central bank digital currency (CBDC). The project began in July 2021 and is expected to be in the investigation phase for 24 months.  The European Union is just one among more than 100 jurisdictions around the world that are researching or developing a CBDC, while the U.S. remains cautious on the merits of a CBDC. The EU Commission is responsible for proposing a digital euro bill later this year and EU leaders are expected to decide whether to use a digital euro after October 2023.  Read more: Slicing the Elephant: Inside the Design of a Digital Euro  In its discussions, the Eurogroup observed that the digital euro should complement and not replace cash, be assigned a legal tender status and ensure a high level of privacy. The group also added the CDBC should be widely accessible to the public, guarantee access to central bank money for euro area users, and its design should consider environmental implications.  CoinDesk had earlier revealed similar details citing a leaked paper.  The Eurogroup also stressed on the need for the digital euro's design to prevent money laundering, illicit funding and tax evasion while maintaining users' trust. Critically, the finance ministers of the eurozone stated that the design of the digital euro should not impair the ability of the European central banks to fulfil their price stability mandate.  The Eurogroup supported the offline functionality of the digital euro for use by citizens in different scenarios, and stated that supervised intermediaries could play an ""important role."" This comes after EU lawmakers criticized Amazon's involvement in the digital euro project to develop a prototype for e-commerce applications of the new CBDC.  The EU's finance ministers also voiced support for interoperability with other CBDCs as a feature for the digital euro while mitigating risks associated with the use of its CBDC outside the euro area. While the International Monetary Fund has raised the possibility of an international CBDC platform, its progress has been delayed.  The next update from the Eurogroup is scheduled for Mar. 13, 2023.

Bitcoin recovers from strong support and rises towards $28,000. The strong levels of support in Bitcoin are $17,000, $13,000, and $3,500, and the bottom is still not confirmed. The price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) rallied above $64,000 in 2021, due to institutional adoption and investment in the cryptocurrency. The ongoing economic uncertainty and monetary policy measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have increased interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, which has contributed to the Bitcoin craze. Other factors that have contributed to the price increase include increased awareness and acceptance of cryptocurrencies in different regions. The sudden price increase in 2021 marked a long-term resistance and pullback in an effort to stabilize the price structure. This article examines the impact of inflation on Bitcoin price and the market's next move in light of the technical analysis. Bitcoin is trading at a strong level of support, and the price will confirm a bottom if it breaks above $28,000. There is a high probability that the price will continue to the downside once the resistance is confirmed. Bitcoin's current upswing is a result of the high level of support and the bottom is still not confirmed. Is Inflation Good for Bitcoin? Inflation does not affect the value of Bitcoin directly because Bitcoin is not issued by the government. However, some investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation because it is decentralized, finite, and has a transparent supply schedule. In that case, if the US dollar loses value due to high inflation, Bitcoin's value increases. The chart below depicts the Consumer Price Index ((CPI)), which measures inflation in the USA. The inflation rate has broken the 40-year record, but the price of bitcoin has fallen by more than 50%, indicating that there is no direct relationship between Bitcoin and inflation. However, there is an indirect relationship between inflation and Bitcoin. Investors are investing in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, which is increasing the demand for Bitcoin. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is increasing interest rates to combat inflation, causing economic uncertainty in the USA. This economic uncertainty is damaging the US dollar. The falling US dollar is favorable for Bitcoin. Relation between Inflation and Bitcoin (fred.stlouisfed.org/) Technical Picture of Bitcoin The monthly Bitcoin chart presents key support and resistance levels in the Bitcoin market. The development of a double top coupled with a break of the $28,000 neckline indicates bearish price action in the market. Once the neckline was broken, the price moved to the major support at $17,000. Since Bitcoin is a highly volatile instrument, the support and resistance levels have roughly $1,000 deviations on both sides. Two monthly closes above or below the support or resistance line are required for the level of support or resistance to be broken. There have been no consecutive monthly closes below $17,000, indicating that support still exists. Bitcoin is currently rising from the support level, and if it continues to do so, it will encounter significant resistance at $28,000. In order for the Bitcoin market to be considered bullish, the price must close the month above $28,000. Bitcoin Monthly (stockcharts.com) Since the emergence of Bitcoin in 2021 was extremely volatile, with the price increasing by more than 1500% in a matter of months, linear charts are difficult to interpret. The logarithmic weekly outlook for Bitcoin is shown in the chart below. The weekly chart illustrates that whenever Bitcoin prices increase, bullish price action commences. The patterns of 2015 and 2020 were bullish inverted head and shoulders, which caused the price to begin its huge upsurge to new heights. However, the price action in 2022 was marked by head-and-shoulder patterns, which are bearish. These bearish price movements suggest that Bitcoin must drop to at least $12,000 to $13,000 or $3,500 before the next significant rally. Bitcoin must also surpass $28,000 on a monthly basis for the next bullish rally to commence. Gold Weekly (stockcharts.com) Bitcoin's price has been subjected to a significant amount of volatility. The types of price movements imply that once Bitcoin has completed the bottom at the defined support levels, the subsequent advance could be massive. Due to the recent price patterns depicted on the Bitcoin monthly chart, it is not feasible to measure the exact target for Bitcoin's next advance. Market Risks The greatest market risk for the Bitcoin market is the prospect of regional regulation. In 2021, China constructed illegal policies against cryptocurrencies. Similarly, the Indian government imposed a 30% tax on crypto transactions, reducing demand for Bitcoin. There are still a number of countries where the use of cryptocurrencies is prohibited, and the concept of cryptocurrencies has not yet caught on in the region. Even in countries where Bitcoin has been utilized, the future use of cryptocurrencies cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, many investors are reluctant to implement cryptocurrencies as investments. This reluctance to utilize Bitcoin as an investment imposes market risk and influences the demand for Bitcoin. The second risk is the emergence of a large number of cryptocurrencies on the market. There are over 12,000 cryptocurrencies, and this number is growing at a faster rate. The increase in the number of cryptocurrencies on the market decreases the demand for Bitcoin, as investors shift attention to newly created cryptocurrencies. Another risk posed by Bitcoin is extreme volatility. The price of Bitcoin increased by 1,542% in April 2021 as shown in the chart below. This type of decade movement indicates extreme volatility, and the price increase is typically followed by long-term fluctuations and a long and complex sideways market. Typically, long-term consolidation serves as the development of the bottom for a subsequent price increase. Currently, bitcoin has fallen to a lower level of support, and it is anticipated that Bitcoin will remain sideways for some time in order to form the bottom. Technically, the bottom in Bitcoin will only be confirmed if $28,000 is broken. Bitcoin Monthly Gain (stockcharts.com) Final Words Based on the preceding discussion, it is concluded that Bitcoin is not directly affected by inflation, but there is some indirect relationship that may impact Bitcoin demand. As a result, higher inflation may have a positive impact on Bitcoin. Inflation is expected to remain high in the USA in 2023, implying that the Fed will raise interest rates. The higher interest rates will slow down the US economy and will have a negative impact on the US dollar, resulting in increased demand for Bitcoin. However, the technical picture indicates some strong support at $17,000. The strong resistance level at $28,000 is regarded as the pivot for Bitcoin's next rally. However, the bottom in Bitcoin has not yet been confirmed, and more pressure may develop. If there is a further downside, $13,000 and $3,500 are strong levels where the bottom can form. Due to the high volatility and uncertainty in the cryptocurrency market, investors should consider Bitcoin as a high-risk investment. However, $13,000 and $3,500 remain the levels at which investors must consider investing in Bitcoin with high risk. Currently, Bitcoin price has the potential to encounter resistance at $28,000 and continue further downside.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4570252-bitcoin-btc-technical-analysis-recovers-from-support-amid-inflation-fears?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/7665614.jpeg

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Soars Past $21.3K to Continue Its 2023 Momentum  By James Rubin  Bitcoin's 2023 feel-good story continued as the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization held firm above the $21,000 heights it last reached in the fall.  BTC was recently trading at about $21,190, a more than 1.6% gain over the past 24 hours amid light trading typical of long, holiday weekends. U.S. equity markets were closed in observance of the Martin Luther King holiday honoring the late civil rights leader. Bitcoin was trading below $17,000 little over a week ago before a rush of favorable economic data, most notably a decline in the U.S. consumer price index (CPI), catapulted crypto and stock prices prices upward.  Ether was recently approaching $1,600, up roughly 1.5% from Sunday, same time. The second-largest crypto in market value has jumped more than 32% this year.  Most other major cryptos spent much of Monday in the green with CRO, the token of exchange Crypto.com, recently rising more than 7% and SOL, the token of the Solana blockchain, up more than 1.4% to continue its momentum of the last three weeks. FTT, the token of embattled crypto exchange FTX, also added to its recent unlikely gains, rising more than 24% at one point.  As CoinDesk's Shaurya Malwa reported, crypto markets' total capitalization surpassed $1 trillion over the weekend, and investors liquidated almost $500 million in shorts, or bets against higher prices, since Friday to mark the highest such levels since October 2022. Meanwhile, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has hit 45, still in fear territory, but more than six times higher from where it stood in June.  ""We see the main driver behind this 20% BTC hike over the past week key as the fact that some macro fears are subsiding with positive economic data in the U.S., including lower inflation stats and strong job growth numbers, in Europe, the [European Union] released unemployment stats which were the lowest in 23 years and China lifted many of the border restrictions,"" Bradley Duke, co-CEO at crypto ETP provider ETC Group, wrote in an email. ""This shift in sentiment was reflected in the BTC futures market, with traders betting long four days in a row based on the long-short ratio.”  Bitcoin's surge has also come as debate over the U.S. debt ceiling intensifies. In a letter to party leaders on Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called on Congress to raise the ceiling as soon as possible, warning that the government would reach a more than $30 trillion borrowing limit on Jan. 19, when the agency would have to take special actions to manage the government's cash flow, possibly into June. On Sunday, freshly minted Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) reiterated his party's call for spending cuts as a precursor to increasing the debt ceiling.  ""Looming large in our three-part thesis on digital asset adoption is the juxtaposition of a growing U.S. debt load set against a declining work force that is ‘aging out,'"" wrote Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, in an email to CoinDesk. ""If we don’t let inflation cut our debt in real terms and we can not grow out it, expect more of it.""  Connors added: ""BTC is more correlated to debasement than inflation, so not surprised to see BTC lift with the prospects of more debt.  Will the current favorable winds for risk-on assets endure? In an email, Craig Erlam, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, noted investors' current optimism but also questioned whether this tone would endure as companies report earnings in the weeks ahead.  ""The question now is whether earnings season will enhance that new sense of hope or spoil the party before it really gets going,"" Earlam wrote. ""Companies have until now been reluctant to let staff go, which has kept the labor market tight even as certain economic indicators weaken and inflation dampens the outlook for demand and costs. A bad earnings season could undermine hopes of a soft landing that looks more possible now than it has for many months.""  Erlam added that whether bitcoin's rise represented ""a resurgence or just a brief rebound"" wasn't clear, ""but there are clearly still some very bullish traders out there. It should make for an interesting few weeks.""

By Sam Reynolds  The FTT token is up spectacularly in the last 24 hours, climbing 24.5% according to CoinDesk data. Over the last two weeks it's up nearly 200%, with many puzzled why the token of a failed exchange is doing so well.  There is no material reason why FTT should be doing anything but staying dormant. The FTX exchange is gone and not being revived. Worse, the Securities and Exchange Commission has taken the opinion – and it's not being contested – that FTT (and other exchange tokens) are securities. Creditors have a long road ahead to get anything back from the courts.  Of course, most exchanges have long delisted FTT. It’s only on KuCoin and a handful of others.  But the market is in the mood for meme token degeneracy. Traders like pushing up and down a corpse, which is why luna classic (Terra’s token) rose and fell like a roller coaster even as the whole project was effectively declared dead earlier this year.  You can also see this in the success of Solana-based BONK, which is driving the recovery of Solana, on the backs of Shiba inu memes and a dislike for Alameda tokens (Sam coins).  Decentraland’s MANA token is also defying gravity, up over 80% in the last week. A minor update pushed out by the team upgraded some parts of the UI/UX but didn’t do anything for the virtual world’s small player base.  Sometimes the market just does what its worst critics accuse it of being, nothing more than a casino.

7655662,https://newsbtc.com/?p=516277,1673913635,"VET Price Retraces, But Sellers Should Short At These Levels","The price momentum of VeChain (VET) registered a halt over the last 24 hours after the altcoin started to trade laterally. In the same time frame, the coin dipped 0.9%, which is minor meaning that VeChain was in consolidation. The coin had picked up bullish momentum at the beginning of this year, but the bears could not sustain the price above the $0.021 mark. The technical outlook of VeChain still points towards bullishness. The altcoin was overvalued at the time of writing, which emphasizes that a price correction is on the way. Related Reading: Glassnode Points Out This Bizarre Consistency In Bitcoin Cycles A price correction also presents a shorting opportunity for traders. The accumulation on the chart also noted a downtick, but despite the downtick, demand for VET was substantial. However, VET will soon lose its current price level if buyers continue to lose interest. At the moment, VeChain has secured the $0.019 price level as its current support mark. Moving below the price above the mark will make VeChain come under the influence of bears again. The VET price is 92% lower than its all-time high secured in 2021. VET Price Analysis: One-Day Chart VeChain was trading at $0.0207 at the time of writing. The altcoin was trading within an upward parallel channel, which showed bullishness. However, VET traded outside the parallel chain over the past trading sessions. As the coin moved outside of the parallel chain, the bulls failed to cross the $0.0212 price level, which acts as the current resistance price level for the coin. Local support for the coin stood at $0.020, and as VeChain depicted a correction, it is expected to fall below the $0.0193 level. Both the $0.020 and the $0.0193 price levels can act as shorting levels for the coin. The amount of VeChain traded in the last session declined, which meant a slight fall in demand. Technical Analysis The altcoin was overvalued on the daily chart, and although demand for the coin registered a fall, the bulls were still hovering in the market. The Relative Strength Index was a few points below 80, indicating that the coin was under the influence of buyers. With a price correction, VET can dip to $0.0193 before it starts to pick up momentum. On the same note, the VET price was above the 20-Simple Moving Average line (SMA), which meant that buyers were driving the price momentum in the market. It was also above the 50-SMA line (yellow); however, another pull from the bears will drag VET below the 50-SMA line. Technical indicators continued to suggest that VET hasn’t lost its bullish steam. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence, which indicates price momentum and reversals, showed green signal bars. Related Reading: Crypto.com Decides To Let Go 20% Of Its Current Workforce Green signal bars are tied to a buy signal, but the recent bar was declining in strength, implying that traders should skip buying the asset right away. The Chaikin Money Flow was above the half-line and registered a fall; the capital inflows were far higher than capital outflows despite the fall. Overall, the market remains on the bulls’ side, but VET has to stay above its crucial support line to keep the bears from returning.
