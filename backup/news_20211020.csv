42424442,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2osPh,1634768820,Cboe Acquires ErisX in Return to Crypto Derivatives Market,"Cboe Global Markets is acquiring crypto spot and derivatives marketplace ErisX, the companies announced Wednesday.  The move gives Cboe, which was the first U.S. company to launch bitcoin futures in 2017 before later shuttering the product, a new set of crypto derivatives offerings through ErisX’s bitcoin and ether futures products, as well as spot crypto trading.  Under the terms of the deal, Cboe will acquire ErisX, which will operate as Cboe Digital, and retain its different subsidiaries. These include Eris Clearing, which is ErisX’s registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO), as well as Eris Spot Market and Eris Exchange, its registered designated contract market (DCM). The subsidiaries allow ErisX to offer its different services.  The transaction is expected to conclude in the next four to six months, ErisX CEO Thomas Chippas told CoinDesk. While the companies have already begun engaging with regulators such as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), they will need approval from the CFTC and around 40 different state regulators to finalize the transaction.  The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, though Cboe intends to use both cash and increased debt.  “What Tom and team have built is a great foundation, built on great vision that we are going to embrace,” Cboe Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Chris Isaacson told CoinDesk. “And with one transaction we get a spot market, which will produce data with derivatives, and a clearinghouse all in one.”  ‘Regulatory-first’  Both Isaacson and Chippas pointed to ErisX’s different regulatory approvals as part of the reason for the acquisition.  “That’s what really attracted us to ErisX: The regulatory-first approach, and all the work that Tom and team have done with the state regulators at the CFTC for derivatives,” Isaacson said. “They’ve just done it the right way, and therefore we have a great foundation to build on.”  ErisX launched in 2018 with financial support from TD Ameritrade, DRW Holdings and Virtu Financial.  Chippas said he believed the regulatory understanding of crypto has been “quite clear and straightforward,” but the actual process of securing different state and federal licenses is a lot of work.  “You have to go to all these different states, you have to apply for different licenses, but it’s work that you put your back into, and you do it, and you’re done,” he said. “And you know that once you’ve done it, you have an obligation to maintain it.”  The companies might look to new products, such as margined futures, which Cboe Digital hopes to launch pending regulatory approval.  Digital advice  Cboe is creating a digital advisory committee to work with Cboe Digital on continuing development of the different spot and derivatives markets. Fidelity Digital Assets, Galaxy Digital, Interactive Brokers, Paxos, Robinhood, NYDIG, Virtu Financial, DRW and Webull are joining, and some of these companies will take minority stakes in Cboe Digital.  Beyond the development of existing products, Cboe hopes to begin providing market data for clients interested in specific crypto execution prices.  “Bringing these partners, it just opens up the door for access to these products to people that don’t have it today, and it’s hard to believe if you’re in crypto every day, how hard can it be to buy bitcoin or ether,” Chippas said. “We’re not asking people to do tricky stuff, they can go on to any variety of platforms and buy crypto today, but most people have complex financial lives.”  Tom Jessop, president of Fidelity Digital Assets, said in a statement that his company is looking forward to working with the new entity.  “The Cboe-ErisX combination represents an attractive opportunity to collaborate with a global exchange operator who can bring increased regulatory proficiency, resilient technology and product expertise to digital asset markets,” he said.  Take two  Cboe was among the first companies to try listing bitcoin futures in the U.S., taking its cash-settled futures product live at the end of 2017 just days before CME launched a similar product. The company later shuttered the product, saying at the time it did not intend to pursue any new crypto derivatives products.  “That was an early entry and looking back at it, it was, it was a good entry … we tend to iterate on products and usually the first iteration of a product is not perfect,” Isaacson said. “That was our evaluation of that product. What excites us so much about ErisX ... is that we actually have a spot market.”  DRW founder and CEO Don Wilson said the acquisition would “accelerate” ErisX’s vision of supporting a market that traditional financial institutions would be willing to participate in.  “We’re going to have the spot market, the data products and the ability to build on top of it so that as people’s sophistication in using these products grows, we’re going to be able to add the things that they and their advisers and portfolio managers need in order to build out well-rounded products that include crypto and crypto derivatives,” Chippas said.  Interest has been growing in these products from institutional investors for some time, with even more expressing interest recently, Chippas said.  “The time is now for this asset class,” Isaacson said. “We believe that, we’ve believed that for quite a few years, but there’s a confluence of events right now [and] we’re there, it’s an inflection point.”  UPDATE (Oct. 20, 2021, 14:05 UTC): Corrects Cboe’s name.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/20/cboe-reenters-crypto-derivatives-market-with-erisx-acquisition,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/24781be3895d1bf2ebd6a43b00448f42fb7a33f3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424455,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2osrh,1634767990,Options Traders Bet Big Ether’s Turn for an ETF Is Coming Soon,"Options traders are turning their attention to long-term bullish bets on the ether cryptocurrency because some anticipate an ether-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) product will likely follow the launch of the first bitcoin futures-based ETF in the U.S.  Data reveals a growing demand for long-dated, out-of-the-money (OTM) call options on ether – bullish bets with strike prices well above the spot market price of the cryptocurrency.  A strong purchase activity was captured on ether’s $15,000 calls expiring March 25, 2022, according to Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital. That’s a far cry from current spot prices; ether traded above $4,000 in the past three days, following bitcoin’s surge to nearly $67,000.  The market’s “long-term attention seems to be shifting from BTC to ETH with potential ETH ETF release after BTC [ETF in the U.S.], coupled with ETH 2.0 [upgrade] catalyst,” QCP Capital wrote in its Telegram channel on Tuesday.  Data provided by crypto derivatives exchange Deribit shows that call options with a strike price at $15,000 have the highest open interest for all options expiring in March 2022.  Genesis Volatility, another data provider, said while the flows for the $15,000-strike calls have been a mix of buyers and sellers, the initial transactions at this strike price started with a buy of roughly 700 contracts on Oct. 15. At the time, open interest, or the number of futures contracts traded but not liquidated with an offsetting position, was at roughly 8,000 contracts. There were about 40,000 contracts open interest for the $15,000-strike March calls as of Wednesday.  “The mix in flow is good,” Greg Magadini, co-founder and CEO of Genesis Volatility, told CoinDesk. “It means there’s a real two-way market here and people hold both views regarding $15,000 being possible.”  Bitcoin’s price surged to a new all-time high earlier Wednesday during trading hours in the U.S after the successful debut of the first U.S. bitcoin futures-based ETF. Some market participants have hoped that an ether ETF may be approved, too, boosting ether’s price.  There are at least five known applications in the U.S. for ether-based ETFs, including two ether futures-based products by fund manager VanEck (The Ethereum Strategy ETF) and ProShares (Ether Strategy ETF).  “With the launch of the bitcoin futures ETF, it has become a certainty that an ether ETF of the same kind can’t be that far off,” Stefan Coolican, president and chief financial officer at investment firm Ether Capital, said. “Both cryptos are decentralized and ether is no more complex than bitcoin in that regard from a regulatory perspective.”  Some speculate that an ether-based ETF will launch as soon as this year.  “An ether ETF will definitely launch this year and will definitely be bullish for ether,” Trey Griggs, CEO of crypto market GSR’s U.S. arm, said in a written response. “The robust interest in the BTC ETF has again sparked rapid-fire conversations in the investment management community about products that track a broad array of altcoins.”  Data shows there are traders willing to bet this will happen. Over the past three days, institution-focused, over-the-counter desk Paradigm noticed its clients’ flows continued to lean “bullish” for ether, with particularly high volumes on both outright and call spread trades for call options expiring November, December and March 2022.  Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to purchase, and the put offers the right to sell.  “What we see are bullish bets for a move higher into year end and March of next year,” Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at Paradigm, told CoinDesk.  QCP also noted that long-term implied volatility (IV) has rallied more than 10% since the past weekend, with a strong put-call skew – the cost of puts relative to calls – favoring calls. Implied volatility is investors’ expectations of price turbulence over a specific period. A higher implied volatility results from greater demand for options and vice versa. That translates into higher prices for both put and call options.  Data from Skew shows the three-month, six-month put-call skews have remained negative in the past week, implying stronger demand for long-term calls.  Not everyone is convinced an ether ETF will hit the market just yet. Sui Chung, CEO of CF Benchmarks, a crypto indexes provider, anticipates the product may arrive sometime in mid-2022, pointing out that it will require a stronger liquidity and open interest in the underlying ether futures market before the launch.  As of Tuesday, the amount of money locked in the ether futures contracts on derivatives exchanges totaled at $10.4 billion. For comparison, the dollar value of bitcoin futures’ open interest was nearly $25 billion on the same day.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Muyao Shen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/options-traders-bet-big-that-ethers-turn-for-an-etf-is-coming-soon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d688bbaa530f63226c911f1fd88603578193236a-4000x2667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424454,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2osfh,1634767110,"Bitcoin All-Time High Breakout Could Target $86K, Price Charts Suggest","Bitcoin’s (BTC) price made a fresh all-time high above $66,000 on Wednesday and could continue higher as bullish momentum improves, price-chart indicators suggest.  A successful breakout would require a daily close above $65,000, which would yield upside targets toward $74,000 and $86,000.  The price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has fully recovered from a near 50% correction earlier this year, which stabilized around the $30,000 support level. Since then, buyers responded to oversold conditions and continued to accumulate long positions, anticipating the stock’s value will rise over time.  The next level of resistance is seen around $74,000, which could briefly stall the current rally. However, buyers will likely remain active above the $60,000-$65,000 support range given positive momentum signals on the weekly chart.  If support is held, BTC could see further upside toward $86,000, which is based on a measured move from the Oct. 1 breakout above the 200-day moving average.  The relative strength index (RSI) on the daily chart is the most overbought since February (current reading around 78), which preceded a brief price pullback. However, at that point, BTC continued to rally about 10% before hitting the April all-time high of $64,899, after which upside momentum slowed.

42424449,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2osdh,1634767017,"After Bitcoin’s All-Time High, What’s Next?","Bitcoin’s latest rally to an all-time high price of above $66,000 has given rise to a fresh wave of bullish predictions, with the cryptocurrency’s price already more than double where it started the year.  “Bitcoin breaking its all-time high was a long time coming and had been in the making ever since the asset shed 50% of its value in May,” Ben Caselin, head of research and strategy for crypto exchange AAX, told CoinDesk in an interview.  He now expects the price to rocket past the $100,000 mark, which a growing number of market analysts are penciling in as their new price target.  The Bitcoin blockchain is just 12 years old, and traders in digital markets and on Wall Street are arguably more focused than ever before on the cryptocurrency’s movements. So with the price now at unprecedented levels, analysts are adjusting their models and scrutinizing charts to predict what comes next.  Just this month alone, bitcoin’s price has rallied more than 50%, fueled by U.S. regulators’ first approval of an exchange-traded fund (ETFs) linked to bitcoin futures contracts. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF started trading on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange and hauled in $570 million of assets on its first day, while garnering an astounding $1 billion in trading volume, in one of the most successful ETF launches of all time.  The market’s previous all-time high was $64,889 in April. Since then, market prognosticators saw that mark as the price to beat. Now, with fewer readily available signposts, the outlook might be harder to gauge.  What the charts are saying  CoinDesk’s Damanick Dantes wrote Wednesday that $86,000 might represent the next key price target for bulls, based on a reading of price-chart signals.  “All eyes are set on the $100K mark, but when retail does rush in and more funds open up to bitcoin, including physically backed ETFs, $100K is unlikely to be the end of it,” Caselin said.  CoinDesk reached out to top market analysts for their insight. Here’s where they see the market headed.  Quick tease: Not everyone is bullish. Some analysts say bitcoin will find further gains past the $60,000 mark tougher to come by.  Bullish  Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer of Stack Funds: Since the launch of ProShares’ ETF, there has been a large influx of retail participation. Funding rates for the futures market – a gauge of how willing investors are to pay up for leveraged bets – are rising, but not at the high levels seen earlier in the year. ”Our next target on spot BTC is $80,000 in the short term,” Dibb said. As the market gains further confidence in the medium term, he said, some capital rotation is to be expected from bitcoin into ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, and other alternative digital assets.  Ulrik Lykke, founder of ARK36: “I wouldn’t be surprised if we see bitcoin climb towards $100,000 during Q4 of 2021 or Q1 of 2022.”  Juan Pellicer, a research analyst at IntoTheBlock: “This growth is a phenomenal proxy of the institutional clients that have been adopting bitcoin.”  Samuel Indyk, an analyst at Investing.com: As has been the case in the past when major events in the cryptocurrency market occur, a correction could be on the cards: “For example, when the bitcoin futures contract launched on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 2017, a bear market occurred shortly after, and it took almost three years for the price to recover.”  What else analysts are saying  One risk is that soaring oil and natural gas prices might lead to extra scrutiny over the Bitcoin network’s energy usage, according to Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. That’s especially the case as winter approaches in the Northern Hemisphere.  “Governments might take harsh stances if this winter leads to shortfalls in energy across several countries and that could mess with the hashrate,” Moya warned.

42424451,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2oslh,1634764991,Crypto Miner Stronghold Digital Soars in Trading Debut,"Stronghold Digital, the bitcoin mining company that converts coal waste into power for its operations, surged in its first day of trading on Wednesday after raising $127 million in its initial public offering (IPO).  The Kennerdell, Pennsylvania-based miner’s IPO was upsized to $19 per share, after previously pricing its IPO at the range of $16 to $18 a share. The shares opened up 42% at $27 on Nasdaq under the ticker “SDIG.” They were recently trading up 65% to $31.37.  Stronghold converts “coal refuse,” a material left over from coal mining, into power used to mine bitcoin at its wholly owned Scrubgrass power plant in Pennsylvania. The company is led by Greg Beard, who is the co-chairman and CEO, and Bill Spence, who is also the co-chairman of the company.  Beard was previously a senior partner and head of natural resources at private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Spence, on the other hand, brings in 40 years of energy-related experience, and formerly owned and operated Coal Valley/Dark Diamond, a coal refuse power generation facility, from 1993 to 2007.  Environmentally beneficial operations  With conversation focused around crypto miners’ ability to use more environmentally friendly power sources, Stronghold is billing its ability to turn coal waste into bitcoin power as an advantage over its peers. “We are committed to generating our energy and managing our assets sustainably, and we believe that we are one of the first vertically integrated crypto asset mining companies with a focus on environmentally beneficial operations,” the company said in its S1 filing.  The miner is essentially taking an age-old traditional mining problem and turning it into a more environmentally friendly business model of the future by mining bitcoin. “Simply put, we employ 21st century crypto mining techniques to remediate the impacts of 19th and 20th century coal mining in some of the most environmentally neglected regions of the United States,” the company said in the filing.  Moreover, Stronghold’s reclamation efforts allow the company to earn tax credits in the form of Coal Refuse Energy and Reclamation Tax Credits, as well as Pennsylvania Tier II Alternative Credits, according to the company’s website.  Lower-cost operations  Stronghold calls itself a “vertically integrated” miner, as its mining rigs are powered by its own power plant, enabling the company to mine bitcoin at a lower cost than its rivals. “Owning our own source of power helps us to produce Bitcoin at one of the lowest prices among our publicly traded peers,” the company said in its filing.  For crypto miners, the biggest operating expense is the cost of power, according to a research note by Jefferies’ analyst Jonathan Petersen. “This is why professional BTC miners spend considerable effort finding locations with the lowest power rates,’’ he wrote.  The net cost of power for Stronghold is about $18 per megawatt-hour (MWh) at its Scrubgrass plant, which is lower than for most other crypto mining companies, according to the company’s data. This helps the company to be profitable when the price of bitcoin is above $3,000, according to a statement Stronghold emailed to CoinDesk. Currently the cryptocurrency is trading at all-time-high of more than $65,000.  “Given that the price of electricity has a significant impact on the ultimate economics and profitability of crypto asset mining, we believe long-term value is enabled primarily by the reduction of power costs and securing environmentally beneficial power generation assets,” Stronghold said in its filing.  Growth strategy  The company plans to grow by acquiring additional environmentally beneficial power generation assets and miners. It is currently in the process of closing on two coal refuse power-generation facilities deals, and intends to use the proceeds of the IPO for acquisitions, according to its filings.  The miner currently operates 3,000 miners with a hashrate capacity of about 185 petahash per second (PH/s). It plans to bring its total hashrate capacity to more than 2,100 PH/s by December and to more than 8,000 PH/s by December 2022.  Stronghold has entered the public market at a very opportune time, as cryptocurrency mining has been very profitable amid the continued rally in the price of bitcoin. In a recent research report, Wall Street firm D.A. Davidson said that the miners are “literally printing money” in the current market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/20/crypto-miner-stronghold-digital-soars-in-trading-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd37d981124721593e3a9bd39092af7f2e1c3226-801x626.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424452,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2osph,1634764917,Market Wrap: Analysts Expect Further Upside After Bitcoin Hits All-Time High,"Bitcoin rallied to an all-time high of around $66,000 on Wednesday, reversing a nearly 50% correction earlier this year. Traders remain optimistic and expect further upside across cryptocurrencies as the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (NYSE: BITO), the first U.S. bitcoin-linked exchange-traded fund, made its debut on Tuesday.  At this point, “short-term corrections outweigh the positive expectations for the final momentum of the BTC rally,” Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior analyst at FxPro, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Further upside, however, could be limited if buyers fail to sustain the rally. Kuptsikevich warned that reaching a new high (or a series of highs) may provoke the “beginning of aggressive profit-taking by large investors who opened positions during the rebound from $30K.”  For now, in the bitcoin options market, traders are pricing in expectations for larger price moves.  “Implied volatility is creeping higher after spiking last week around the bitcoin ETF approval,” Gregoire Magadini, CEO of Genesis Volatility, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The theme of $100K BTC by end-of-year is back in vogue,” Magadini wrote.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $66,087.65, +2.57%  Ether (ETH): $4,095.42, +6.88%  S&P 500: +0.37%  Gold: +0.83%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.654%, +0.02% percentage point  Bitcoin breakout could yield further upside  BTC could continue higher as bullish momentum improves, price-chart indicators suggest.  A successful breakout would require a daily close above $65,000, which would yield upside targets toward $74,000 and $86,000. BTC will need to see continued buying pressure to keep the current rally intact, preferably above $60,000-$65,000. Read more here.  Start of another bull rally  Blockchain indicators also point to further upside for bitcoin. For example, BTC’s market-value-to-realized-value (MVRV) ratio suggests that the price is not yet overvalued.  “Throughout the 2013, 2017 and 2021 runs, an MVRV of 3.0 or above has indicated a local price top,” crypto research firm Coin Metrics wrote in a Tuesday newsletter. “At the other end of the spectrum, an MVRV of 1.0 or below has signaled the bottom of a cycle,” the firm wrote.  MVRV recently broke above the 2.0 level for the first time since May, which also occurred during the start of bitcoin’s 2020 bull run.  ETFs present a new frontier for crypto  Market participants are increasingly bullish as cryptocurrencies gain greater traction among global investors.  While futures-based ETFs are not investors’ first choice, the combination of crypto and ETFs could make a big splash by introducing a new class of investor to both sectors. Consider that the global ETF industry has $9.4 trillion in assets under management, growing at an annual rate of 26%, while crypto’s market capitalization sits at $2.75 trillion, CoinDesk’s Edward Oosterbaan and George Kaloudis wrote.  If the first day of trading was any indication, the U.S. market has clearly been waiting for easier access to bitcoin. Read more here.

42417112,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4rxV,1634763349,The View From Brussels: How the EU Plans to Regulate Crypto,"The European Union (EU) wants to regulate the digital asset industry; there are a number of bloc-wide initiatives already underway. The most comprehensive is a 168-page “Markets in Crypto-Assets” (MiCA) that would create an EU-level licensing framework for crypto issuers and service providers.  But crypto regulations are only one part of a larger Web 3.0 governance strategy for the political and economic union of 27 nations.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  According to Eva Kaili, a member of the European Parliament, the new proposals for digital assets, data and artificial intelligence (AI) were all inspired by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2016, which sought to strengthen consumers’ control over how their data is used by companies allowed to operate in the EU.  For digital assets in particular, the catalyst was Facebook’s 2019 plans to build its own stablecoin, libra (now diem), a digital token backed by a basket of currencies and assets, Kaili said. She added that regulatory clarity for digital finance is key to fostering innovation and protecting citizens freedom and sovereignty from being exploited by Big Tech.  Kaili is a Greek politician, a member of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament; she was elected in 2014. Kaili has advocated for innovation-friendly regulations for distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications and decentralized finance (DeFi).  CoinDesk got a chance to speak to Kaili about her views on MiCA, the current regulatory frenzy over stablecoins, Web 3.0 and, of course, Facebook’s Diem.  The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  More from Policy Week:  Stablecoins Not CBDCs: An interview with Rep. Tom Emmer  Crypto Learns to Play DC’s Influence Game  Kristin Smith: Crypto Is Too Big for Partisan Politics  Lyn Ulbricht: Put America’s Geeks to Work, Don’t Cage Them  Preston J. Byrne: Decentralization’s Challenge to Policymakers Is Coming  Aubrey Strobel and Alex Adelman: Kill the BitLicense  Bennett Tomlin: What Stablecoins Might Become  CoinDesk: There are a number of regulatory initiatives in progress in the EU that will directly impact the crypto space in the coming years. Which are the most important, in your opinion?  Kaili: The upcoming regulatory initiatives are designed to provide legal certainty and to test these new technologies in collaboration with traditional players and stakeholders. It will hopefully be completed by the end of 2022.  The first framework is “Markets in Crypto-Assets, or MiCA. It’s part of the EU’s digital finance strategy, and it tries to deal in a holistic manner with the crypto ecosystem to establish clear and new licensing requirements that are passport-able. And this means we were trying to pave the way [by] initiating a robust regulatory response, as we did with GDPR.  MiCA will allow firms to operate across the EU, and also set stronger consumer protection standards. It also sets out rules for digital asset issuance and public offerings, and has some specific requirements relating to stablecoins. It lays out additional requirements for the big, systemically important stablecoins, too. MiCA is going through its first readings [in the parliament], so it has some way to go. There have been no consultations between the EU parliament and council yet.  Then you have the pilot regime for market infrastructures based on DLT. I am a rapporteur [the person who gives reports] on that one. I would say it’s not only an ambitious project but also a much anticipated sandbox project. It’s quite unique for the EU because it’s aiming to test new business models deploying DLT in the EU financial infrastructure, and the provisions will translate into a huge testing environment that will operate in a uniform manner across the EU, just like what MiCA is trying to do for crypto assets. It would offer concrete testing outcomes, and then this would feed the future policymaking and regulatory adaptation. So when you are exiting the sandbox, you are participating in creating the regulatory framework to follow. It has gone through the EU Council and parliament first readings, and it seems to go through these negotiations quite smoothly.  A lot of EU regulators are showing concern over stablecoins, and MiCA is considerably focused on regulating stablecoins in particular. Why is that?  Back in 2019, the discussions around Facebook’s stablecoin, libra, now called diem, led us to accelerate legislative initiatives and to explore what could happen if we have global currencies coming from not just central banks but also from private players. Certain stablecoins could work on a global level, and have a global reach. They are what the EU calls significant e-money tokens. They are addressed by MiCA because they could indeed raise concerns regarding the EU monetary policy, stability and sovereignty. But this is not just an EU concern.  Since several countries are now exploring central bank digital currencies including China and Russia, I would say that global stablecoins can have unprecedented effects on all economies because of the connectedness of the financial system. And also consider that for the first time in more than a century, the U.S. dollar supremacy is being challenged. The rise of cryptocurrencies and stablecoins may be forcing us to rethink what a currency is, who regulates it, and what it means if it’s not controlled by the national government.  Then, we have this political dimension that we have to take under consideration. Even if we don’t want to admit it, we have to have central bank digital currencies because it’s a matter of geopolitical dominance. It can also become a matter of monetary sovereignty, especially when you don’t have like-minded countries deploying similar platforms and marketplaces.  Read More: DeFi Is Like Nothing Regulators Have Seen Before. How Should They Tackle It? | David Z. Morris  We have to also consider the private players. I think we will very quickly see a digital euro, maybe we’re already late, but I believe if we had stablecoins from Facebook without a central bank digital currency, then the risk would be bigger. But I also think it’s going to be very interesting to consider the flip side. When you have Russia, China, U.S. and Europe launching their own digital currencies, what would that mean for the diem and other private stablecoins?  Do you feel there’s anything missing in these frameworks, particularly with MiCA?  One of the challenges we have is a lack of clear definitions to understand exactly what is not covered by the MiCA.  The problem that we see, and I believe it will have to be addressed by us in the future, is that the decentralized finance, or DeFi, business model does not fit into the MiCA framework as no single entity can be identified in DeFi projects and they do not fall under the definitions used in centralized finance.  There, we have an issue because decentralization has great benefits, but also some significant risks. Crypto adopters cannot turn to the authorities in case of fraud or cyber attacks or if they accidentally lose their funds. If decentralized systems don’t have a clear definition, then we have to definitely address it to give the industry that legal certainty. We also have to support the cryptocurrency exchanges to be able to provide this consumer protection, also for themselves not to face issues that would make it impossible to operate in Europe, and also to help them [learn] what transparency is for us and the governance standards that would protect consumer funds against these attacks and malfunctions within their responsibilities. So these are the main concerns around the MiCA framework.  How does the EU’s approach to digital asset regulation compare to other jurisdictions around the world?  First of all, the nature of the European Union is different. We have 27 different member states with different legal and tax systems that are not harmonized. So we are trying to adopt a unique approach to policy making with MiCA. We are allowing room to test the technology, we are interacting with stakeholders and we are trying to establish concrete proposals to create legal certainty, clarity, at least in this first big step that we are taking. When we talk about technology that is developed in a more, let’s say, free way, in the U.S. or Asia, I would say that a lack of standards or legal certainty has its own challenges. You see what’s happening with El Salvador with the government suddenly legalizing bitcoin. You see what happened with China, for example. China had the highest concentration of bitcoin miners and then suddenly changed [its] approach. Then the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission], which is reportedly investigating DeFi platforms and the parties behind them. It’s an unclear investigation.  I think the U.S. might be taking a slightly hostile approach. So we try to see what we don’t want to have in Europe. We are more careful. We don’t speed up too much.  We did have some problems initially. We started by trying to fit new things and innovations in old boxes, so we struggled a little. But now, we are trying to create hybrid boxes so we don’t expect innovation to fit our old boxes. We are creating new boxes and allowing them to keep evolving without feeling that it is a hostile environment. This is how I feel, but it also depends on the specific cases. I’m working a lot in the crypto space. So at least I can speak for the crypto space and say that our approach is innovation friendly, mainly.  It seems as if the apprehension over Facebook’s libra has revealed some greater concerns about the influence of big tech in the EU. In the EU at least, as you said, regulating digital assets is not just about digital asset disruption in particular but part of a larger digital strategy concerning the internet, data and financial sovereignty. Is this a fair assessment?  We understand that whoever owns or holds data now holds a lot of power and that you can generate great value from data, and this applies to the crypto space, too, as it generates transaction data. As part of the digital strategy, and parallel to MiCA, we are also working on the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act. For the first time, after several decades, we are using the internet to regulate the internet along with the access to data and the parties that are using this data. So I think that a well-regulated, data-driven financial sector also needs a well-regulated data economy. Data is now a commodity but many consumers do not understand exactly how it is a commodity. For example, consumers can consent to sharing their data while they can’t control how that data is being used.  I think there is a risk that the greater sharing of data could lead also to customers with certain characteristics to be excluded from markets or from borrowing money. For example, if businesses have access to more data through open finance, this could lead to more personalized pricing of insurance policies, which is an absolute no-go in Europe. This increased individualizing of risk is likely to affect more vulnerable or low-income consumers. If you have predictive [artificial intelligence], for instance, it could lead to calculating credit scores, or insurance premiums for citizens to exclude them or to include them. This could violate our fundamental principles and rights. So we need to have some objectives when we design our strategy to protect fair pricing practices.  I would say there is a great need to have efficient data legislation and we have to understand the process of how to extract the value of data for the public good and at the same time balance it with innovation. I’d say the data legislation file will arrive in January. This means we will make more data available to European companies, we will make sure that they will have to open up and share some data with startups and researchers, which is not the case at this point. We hope to achieve the portability harmonization of data across the EU, similar to what we’re trying to achieve in the crypto space. It’s the same principles for every sector that we have to also include in the financial sector.  What you’re saying is it’s important to find a way to make sure that consumer data isn’t siloed by one or two big companies?  I don’t believe we should not have big companies. I just believe we should understand their business models and make sure that we set certain rules when we open up to new players. We should have more competition. This will increase and improve the quality of the services. And this would ensure a level playing field for newcomers. But these big players, they’re not really located in the EU, at least, the significant ones that we all understand we’re talking about.  But wouldn’t this potential carveout of Big Tech go against the EU objective of tech neutrality you mentioned earlier that gives citizens the freedom to decide which tech they want to use to serve them best?  I would use the word “reciprocity.” To overcome this problem, you have to set your principles and standards. If a company follows those principles, it should be able to enter your market. If not, they shouldn’t.  This is addressed in the Artificial Intelligence Act that is under the EU parliament microscope. It lays out standards for bigger players, the more risky applications, even if they’re not based in the EU. It means that if you want to access this market, you have to respect the outcome of these principles Europe wants to protect. So if we consider that something they do is harmful, it could be completely banned. This usually applies to businesses that use facial recognition, health-care tech or weaponized AI. Whoever wants to enter the EU market, they have to follow the same rules, even if they come from other countries.  When we created GDPR, everybody thought it would fail. Now it seems like it was not just welcome, but it actually led the way for like-minded countries to improve the quality of services and make sure users feel protected and safe online, and ensuring people’s rights online. So I think we’re going to follow the same path. And we have a lot of work to do to strike a good balance to protect the well being of citizens, and avoid becoming protectionist.

42421710,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDHJ,1634757775,Why Bitcoin Is Worth at Least a Penny,"As bitcoin blasted through new all-time highs Wednesday, the following joke made the rounds.  Jamie Dimon walks into a bar and orders a martini.  “Bitcoin or cash?” asks the bartender.  “You want to know my opinion on bitcoin?” says the JPMorgan CEO. “It’s worthless.”  The bartender replies: “I know, but tell me anyway.”  Every big run-up in bitcoin’s price prompts another debate about whether the oldest and largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ($1.26 trillion, according to the latest CoinDesk data) is worth anything at all. However, the likes of Dimon and other boomers are wrong when they say bitcoin is worth nothing.  I have no idea where the price is headed (no one knows, really), what the “true” value is or whether it’s well below or well above current levels. (As always, do your own research and do not put in more than you afford to lose.) All I know is that it’s greater than zero, for the following reasons:  Censorship resistance  Bitcoin allows for the quick, trustless transmission of value without the need for a middleman. It is a way to transact value (and data) among people without the meddling of governments or corporations.  I could go on and on about why this is valuable, as I have for years, but don’t take my word for it. Ask WikiLeaks. Ask OnlyFans. Ask Meduza, the Russian news outlet that was branded a “foreign agent” by the Kremlin and turned to bitcoin and other crypto donations to weather the resulting hit to its advertising business.  Simply put, bitcoin is censorship-resistant in an era of creeping financial censorship.  That is worth something.  Seizure resistance  Bitcoin is difficult to confiscate. Not impossible, but difficult. It requires the would-be confiscator to get ahold of the cryptographic private keys to a bitcoin wallet, which in turn requires the cooperation of the keyholder (assuming the person has properly secured his or her keys).  That helps explain bitcoin’s appeal to people living under repressive regimes, and even in the West there are edge cases where this quality could prove advantageous – say, by preventing a prosecutor from unilaterally freezing all a defendant’s assets before the person has been convicted of a crime (a practice that leaves the accused unable to pay for the counsel of their choice).  I’ve quoted Nathan Cook, now CTO of Zen Protocol Development, on this point before, but I can’t improve on his wonderful passage from 2015, so here it is again:  An owner of bitcoin no longer has the problem faced by the owner of any other transferable asset: ‘Will my property rights be respected?’ Holders of bitcoin own it in virtue of material facts independent of their social relations. The world may turn its back on bitcoin, yea, its value may fall to fractions of a cent, but those who own it will own it regardless.  That, in itself, is worth something – especially until civil asset forfeiture is reformed.  Scarcity amid inflation  Bitcoin has a capped supply and a predictable schedule of issuance: 6.25 BTC are mined every 10 minutes, and that amount is cut in half every four years or so and will continue to be halved until the supply reaches a hair under 21 million units sometime in 2140, when we’re all dead (except maybe Peter Thiel, God bless him). After that, no more bitcoin will ever be created unless the algorithm in the software is changed by a consensus of the network, which is theoretically possible but exceedingly unlikely because it would go against the interests of pretty much everyone involved (miners, users, developers).  As such, some investors look at bitcoin as a hedge against inflation, a role traditionally played by gold. Arguably, bitcoin is even scarcer than gold because you never know when someone’s going to dig up some shiny rocks from the ground or from an asteroid, whereas we know with near certainty how much bitcoin will exist at any given time.  The lazier critics like to point out that there are thousands of other cryptocurrencies with similar characteristics as bitcoin, and claim this means the original is not scarce at all. Anyone who tells you this has not done their homework.  As a first mover, bitcoin has network effects on its side. It has far and above the highest hashrate, or level of computing power devoted to securing the network, among those cryptos that use proof-of-work, a mechanism by which participants agree on which set of records is true. For this reason, bitcoin at the network level is (almost) impossible to hack (centralized exchanges are another story) and arguably the most secure coin in the most secure category. There are other consensus mechanisms, such as proof-of-stake, but none has been tested to the degree proof-of-work has.  That’s not to say other cryptos can’t have value, but there’s a reason bitcoin to this day still has the highest market capitalization among cryptos despite the proliferation of challengers, and it’s not just name recognition.  Long story short, if it’s not bitcoin it’s not bitcoin, and there will almost certainly never be more than just under 21 million of them.  Compare that to the U.S. M2 money supply, also hitting all-time highs, with no constraints other than the restraint of Washington policymakers, and consider all this in light of recent headlines about inflation.  There are smart people who argue the extraordinary measures the U.S. Federal Reserve took in response to the 2008 global financial crisis and later the coronavirus pandemic aren’t really “money printing” and that the recent increases in consumer prices are due to supply chain bottlenecks and therefore temporary.  Maybe they’re right. You can think of bitcoin as insurance against the possibility they’re wrong.  That is worth something.  Bottom line  What are all these “somethings” worth when put together, even taking into consideration the undeniable risks (regulatory crackdowns, software bugs and future competition to name a few)?  I don’t know. But at the risk of appearing to damn Satoshi Nakamoto’s brilliant invention with faint praise, I’ll say it’s worth at least a penny.

Bitcoin Netflow Has Historically Approached Zero Before Major Price Upswings As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there seems to be a relationship between BTC netflows and price swings upward. The Bitcoin netflow indictor is defined as the difference between the inflows and the outflows, and it shows the net amount of the crypto entering or exiting centralized exchanges. When the metric takes on negative values, it means there are more investors withdrawing their coins compared to those depositing. Sustained such a trend can be bullish for BTC as holders usually take their crypto off exchanges for hodling or selling through OTC deals. On the other hand, when more coins are flowing into exchanges than those flowing out, the netflow shows positive values, which may be bearish as it implies investors are sending their Bitcoin to exchanges for withdrawing to fiat or for buying altcoins. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the value of the indicator over the last year: The relation between BTC price and the netflows | Source: CryptoQuant In the above graph, the analyst has marked the behavior of the indicator compared with the Bitcoin price.

42417106,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcS4qi5,1634756246,Some NFTs Are Probably Illegal. Does the SEC Care?,"Here’s a terrifying thought: The U.S. government still doesn’t really know how to regulate the $2.5 trillion crypto market. It’s not that the laws don’t exist, or that Congress is uninterested in digital assets – it’s more that there’s a lack of consensus on how to apply existing regulations to an industry that seems to mutate every few weeks.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  This is a pattern that has repeated itself over crypto’s decade-long history. Back in 2017, crypto’s hottest trend was the ICO, or initial coin offering. In the way that a traditional company might issue new shares of stock to the public through an initial public offering, crypto companies were trying to issue new cryptocurrencies as a kind of fundraising mechanism. Eventually, the Securities and Exchange Commission decided ICOs amounted to unregistered securities offerings. If it looks like a security and walks like a security, it’s probably a security.  Today, Congress faces similar challenges at the murky intersection of existing policy and new tech. Do DAOs count as companies? Which crypto companies get to register as federal banks? And should the Federal Reserve issue its own digital currency to keep up?  So far, non-fungible tokens (NFT) haven’t figured in the conversations.  Where stocks and conventional cryptocurrencies are “fungible,” in the sense that any one asset can be exchanged for another of equal value (e.g., a dollar is always worth exactly as much as another dollar), NFTs are unique tokens attached to media files. They’ve proven especially handy for monetizing digital art: Turning a single image file into 100 NFTs is like printing 100 copies of a physical work. Rather than being interchangeable, each token is effectively stamped with its own number.  But as with ICOs, NFTs pose their own unique regulatory risks. Dapper Labs, the company behind the runaway NBA Top Shot NFT franchise, was hit with a class-action lawsuit over alleged violations of securities laws. And even SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce, who has cultivated a reputation as one of the country’s most crypto-friendly regulators, has said that certain frameworks for selling NFTs could get investors into trouble with the law.  Olta Andoni, chief legal officer for an NFT company called Nifty’s, identified a few major areas in which NFTs might be considered securities under existing regulations.  “The most straightforward way that I think is going to be super-dangerous is fractionalizing, which means that you allow for multiple investors to buy portions of [an] NFT,” she said. There’s a way in which buying a slice of an NFT is a little like buying a slice of a company, i.e., a share. It’s becoming an increasingly common practice thanks to the popularity of programs like PartyBid and Fractional.  Lucky for us, there’s already plenty of legal precedent here. Per the Howey Test – a multi-part rubric for determining whether or not something qualifies as an investment contract – a security is defined as an investment in a “common enterprise” with the expectation that someone else is going to make your investment go up.  Stocks fit the bill because shareholders expect their company to become more valuable over time, thanks to the efforts of its employees.  “I think [fractionalized NFTs] are more at risk because you have a user or individual that is investing money in a common enterprise,” explained Andoni.  Speaking with CoinDesk over the phone, Hester Peirce concurred. “If you take something and you slice it up, and you sell slices of that thing whether it’s NFT or something else, then that could very much start to look like a security,” she explained.  Andoni said there’s an added danger for developers who issue a collection of NFTs but retain ownership over a certain amount. In that case, the NFTs start to resemble shares in a company. When the founders have a majority stake, there’s a vested interest in making the price go up.  Larva Labs, the New York-based company behind CryptoPunks, is maybe the most prominent example of this approach. One of the company’s co-founders has said the team reserved 1,000 NFTs for themselves ahead of the public launch back in 2017. CryptoPunks are now the most valuable NFTs in the world, and the Ethereum wallet with the most tokens appears to be controlled by Larva Labs.  This past summer, a story in The Hollywood Reporter revealed that United Talent Agency had signed Larva Labs’s three major NFT projects (CryptoPunks, Autoglyphs and Meebits) “for representation across film, TV, video games, publishing and licensing.” All signs point to a burgeoning CryptoPunks media empire, with Larva Labs at the helm.  This is complicated by the idea that while NFTs can be a vehicle for speculation, they’re also defined by the media with which they’re associated. There’s an argument to be made that crypto-backed ownership of a song, image or video can provide psychic benefits that stocks can’t.  Lewis Cohen, an attorney at tech-focused firm DLx Law, framed that idea in terms of “consumptive interest.” What are you actually getting when you buy an NFT?  “With many NFTs it’s important to understand what the actual consumptive interest is, whether it is the enjoyment of knowing your special relationship to an artwork, to be able to identify yourself publicly as having been the one person who purchased this artwork, or something else,” said Cohen. “But that’s not always clear.”  Last week, I asked Hester Peirce about CryptoPunks specifically.  CryptoPunks is a collection of 10,000 unique images tied to NFTs. If Larva Labs is effectively a majority shareholder of these 10,000 slices of IP, and it is working out movie and video game deals with UTA in an effort to increase the value of that IP, does CryptoPunks end up functioning like an investment contract?  Peirce demurred, but her refusal to answer the question was itself somewhat revealing. Here’s what she said, in full:  I mean, I’m gonna not weigh in on that, because I have Coy [Garrison, counsel to Commissioner Peirce] standing and looking at me and telling me that I shouldn’t. But I think there are a lot of – I mean, you’re raising an interesting scenario. And I think this is why people need to be very careful.  My advice to people is, look at your facts and circumstances, set them down on a piece of paper and then read it with the eyes of an SEC lawyer. And make sure that you get someone to think about getting the advice that you need before you walk down the road.  But maybe the better question is whether the SEC would even care about NFTs, in practice. Between crypto-fueled ransomware gangs, carbon-hungry bitcoin mining companies, and a stablecoin industry backed by shadow banks, regulators probably have bigger concerns in the realm of digital assets.  Andoni thinks the SEC doesn’t have the resources to go after every NFT project flirting with the line between token and investment contract, but admitted things could change.  “I think someone is watching. I don’t think that they’re gonna be letting all these projects go easily because some are just, like, this close to becoming a security,” she said. “I’m still so optimistic about the NFT space. I just hope that we’re not gonna ruin it.”  Investment schemes come and go, but the threat of regulation is forever. NFTs became a major market about a year ago – stablecoins have been around for nearly a decade, and the White House has only just started thinking about reining them in. For now, it’s not entirely clear what constitutes a legal NFT drop.  “Our doors are open, people can come talk to us,” said Peirce on the question of noncompliant NFTs. “It’s just, unfortunately, part of the landscape because we don’t have clarity right now.”  More from Policy Week  Nik De: What I Learned About Crypto Regulation From a Week in DC  David Z Morris: Lassoing the Stallion: How Gensler Could Approach DeFi Enforcement  Bitcoin ETFs Aren’t New.

Both are currently experimenting with the use of sidechains and bridges to minimize the cost fees on NFTs by close to 98%. With this partnership, HUMBL has become the first among the growing number of companies within the Blocks Builders to leverage the various Blocks Builder&apos;s Modules to build better using BLOCKS. The Goal of the Collaboration Between BLOCKS And HUMBL There are lots of things that will be achieved through this collaboration. Both platforms are already working on improving the non-fungible token (NFT) metadata storage across projects like music and video. They are also trying to develop a better &apos;verified by BLOCKS &apos; registry built to enable users to authenticate, track, and verify their NFT holdings irrespective of their location. Both BLOCKS and HUMBL are also experimenting with BLOCKS builders blockchain plugin modules that include ticketing, real estate, payments, etc., on the HUMBL Wallet and the HUMBL platform.

42424450,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2osjh,1634753727,Martin Shkreli’s Wu-Tang Clan Album Now Belongs to a DAO,"Back in 2015, the pharmaceutical executive and fraudster Martin Shkreli purchased the sole physical copy of “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” the seventh studio album by the Wu-Tang Clan.  When Shkreli was sent to prison in 2018, the album was seized by the federal government, which held onto it until earlier this year. It was sold in July to an unknown party for an undisclosed amount.  On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the mysterious buyer was PleasrDAO, the investment collective that’s spent the past year buying up multimillion-dollar non-fungible tokens (NFT). The sale price was $4 million.  It makes sense, in a way. NFTs are one-of-one cryptocurrencies attached to media files. Proponents say they encourage a new sort of economic framework for digital art, based around patronage. If an NFT purchase funds an album or artwork, the work can still exist online, for free, while the artist gets paid.  It’s the inverse of the Wu-Tang model, where a single purchaser was able to effectively keep the music from the rest of the world. This was part of the concept behind the album – the initial sale contract prevented the buyer from releasing the music commercially for 88 years.  Though the general public has still never heard “Once Upon a Time in Shaolin,” PleasrDAO member Jamis Johnson has described the album as a sort of “O.G. NFT.”  DAOmentum  DAO stands for “decentralized autonomous organization” – a kind of investment group built around shared ownership of a cryptocurrency. Think corporations, without the actual incorporation.  CoinDesk has also learned that an agency called 6, which works with clients in the NFT space, brokered the deal between the PleasrDAO and the U.S. government.  6 co-founder Jesse Grushack told CoinDesk in an interview that he and his partners brought the idea to PleasrDAO earlier this year.  “The U.S. government was very clear that they needed to get rid of this to basically pay back the debts that Martin had accrued and had been legally liable for,” Grushack said. “They didn’t want this deal to become like a public auction or anything, they just wanted it to be like a closed-door thing.”  Ultimately, it’s up to PleasrDAO to decide whether or not it wants to keep the music under wraps. Because the album can’t legally have a commercial release, the DAO may decide to get creative.  “We believe that we can do something with this piece,” Johnson told the Times, “to enable it to be shared and ideally owned in part by fans and anyone in the world.”  “Theoretically, [PleasrDAO] could have 5,000 owners of the album and make a private listening party for those owners,” said Grushack, nodding to the concept of fractionalized NFTs (something PleasrDAO has played around with before). “I think it’s gonna be up to them to figure out the way to bring this back to the people.”",NEUTRAL,없음,TRADING,Will Gottsegen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/20/martin-shkrelis-wu-tang-clan-album-now-belongs-to-a-dao,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/630d41e491a8673b2349afe95a217386eebebf87-1600x1215.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42421038,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXBHfp,1634753591,Bitcoin ETFs Aren’t New. Here’s How They’ve Fared Outside the US,"Trading for the first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began this week for U.S. investors, and the cryptocurrency market appears to be rallying around its launch. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) was the first to list on the New York Stock Exchange, with trading starting on Tuesday.  However, it’s vital to note what the approved ETF actually looks like and how much potential demand there might be for these products. One way to gauge interest is to see how other ETFs around the world have performed and what investors are actually looking for in a bitcoin investment vehicle.  This article is part of Crypto 2022: Policy Week, a look at how regulators and legislators are shaping cryptocurrency and how the industry is fighting back.  The SEC-approved bitcoin ETF is a futures-based trading products and does not hold any of the underlying crypto assets. A futures-based ETF tracks a derivative of bitcoin, rather than the actual asset. According to CoinDesk Learn, “Bitcoin futures may diverge from the spot price of bitcoin due to the prevailing market sentiment, so bitcoin futures ETFs might also occasionally track the price of bitcoin inaccurately.”  In contrast, spot-based ETFs hold the underlying asset and give investors direct exposure to the price movements of bitcoin. However, these investment products have been repeatedly rejected by the SEC.  Read more: What Is a Bitcoin Futures ETF?  Looking north: ETFs in Canada  As Americans attempt to understand the effects of the futures ETF, there is no better place to look than Canada for contrast. The upstairs neighbor has several crypto-focused ETFs trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange with billions of dollars in assets under management. 3iQ Coinshares, Purpose Bitcoin and CI Galaxy Bitcoin are three of the largest funds; Purpose is the largest with $1.2 billion (CAD $1.64 billion) in assets under management (AUM) as of Oct. 13.  More importantly, the top three ETFs by AUM are all directly invested in spot bitcoin with the futures-based alternative drawing in only $7.6 million (CAD $10.48 million) AUM or about 0.3% of Canadian ETFs, providing insight to the preference of investors.  An interesting fact comes to bear if we look at the holders of the Purpose and CI Galaxy ETFs. According to FactSet, the Purpose Bitcoin ETF is held by “unknown entities” while ~28% of CI Galaxy ETF holders are institutions, namely Bain Capital Public Equity and CI Investments.  This likely means the holders of Purpose are individual investors or smaller investment advisors, which aligns with the ethos of the requisite parties. CI GAM and Galaxy’s focus is on institutions, while Purpose Investments markets itself as an innovative consumer financial services company. With that, given the growth of crypto has been largely retail-driven, it might be unsurprising that Purpose’s ETF has more than three times the AUM of CI Galaxy’s.  What’s more, Purpose Investments recently announced that it has applied for three more crypto-focused ETFs along with a privately offered fund offering exposure to decentralized finance.  Spot ETFs favored globally  Investors around the world, including in Germany and Switzerland, are flocking to physically backed exchange-traded products (ETPs). The 21Shares bitcoin ETP, which is 100% exposed to spot BTC, is listed on both the Swiss Exchange and several German exchanges and is nearing half a billion dollars in AUM. Much like the Canadian ETFs, 21shares ETP has 100% exposure to single asset bitcoin and has significantly more demand than their crypto indexes and multi-asset counterparts, of which the largest has $215 million in AUM.  One of the newer entrants to the bitcoin ETF world, Brazil, also went with the spot based option. QR Capital’s bitcoin ETF is trading on the São Paulo exchange and holds 100% BTC with $41 million (BRL $227.5 million) in AUM.  Why do investors prefer physically backed or spot bitcoin ETFs?  According to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, futures ETFs could cost an additional 5% to 10% per year to roll into new futures contracts at each expiry alongside another 1% to 2% in fees. Furthermore, futures ETFs are only 85% exposed to the underlying asset, with the remaining 15% being invested in other asset classes.  Spot ETFs track the price of the underlying asset much more closely than their futures-based counterparts for less of a cost, making the product more attractive to investors who want direct exposure to bitcoin without custody risk. For example, according to Bloomberg, Horizon’s Front Month Rolling Bitcoin Index has returned 530% over the past two years, while bitcoin itself returned 660% over the same period.  If we look at price correlation of bitcoin, a bitcoin spot ETF (Purpose) and a bitcoin futures ETF (Horizon Betapro), we see that the futures ETF does an adequate job of tracking the price of bitcoin. However, the spot ETF maintains slightly closer price correlation.  Given the cost of maintaining a spot ETF is lower than maintaining a futures ETF, it follows that a spot ETF would be a better option strictly for tracking the price of bitcoin. Note that the correlation chart included considers the direct price correlation rather than a correlation on returns to showcase how well the ETFs track bitcoin on a dollar basis, as we are not looking cross-asset.  Why is the SEC adamant on approving a less favorable alternative?  The chairman of the SEC has been outspoken about investor protection and the oversight that comes alongside futures markets and other derivatives. Gensler deemed the spot bitcoin market susceptible to manipulation and an illegitimate source for an exchange-traded product. However, Bitwise argues the regulated CME bitcoin market is now the leader in price discovery, making it a viable option for spot-based ETFs.  The addition of any bitcoin ETF was a long time coming in the United States, but hopeful ETF providers have had even less luck in other countries, with France and Australia just beginning to offer “crypto-focused” equity funds. Holding stock in mining companies or in crypto-invested strategic companies like MicroStrategy has been a loophole for investors to gain exposure to the growth of the crypto industry. The United States’ recent decision may pave the way for regulation worldwide, considering its sheer dominance throughout other ETF markets.  While futures-based ETFs are not investors’ first choice, the combination of crypto and ETFs could make a big splash, introducing a new class of investor to both sectors. Consider that the global ETF industry currently has $9.4 trillion in assets under management, growing at an annual rate of 26%, while crypto’s market capitalization sits at $2.75 trillion – and most of its value is being held on retail exchanges, in trusts like Grayscale (a CoinDesk sister company) or on-chain where it can be used as intended. The U.S. represents $5.47 trillion in ETF AUM, or 70% of the overall market, signaling its adoption of crypto ETFs could be unprecedented.  Sufficient demand for the futures product could also lead to an influx of capital to ETF markets and increase buying pressure on BTC. If the first day of trading was any indication, the U.S. market has clearly been waiting for easier access to bitcoin. ProShares’ BITO ETF did over $1 billion in volume, the second highest of any ETF at launch.  Furthermore, the launch of futures-based ETFs may be a stepping stone to the maturity of bitcoin trading markets and the eventual listing of a spot-based product. If the SEC agrees with Bitwise, that the regulated CME market is responsible for price discovery, a wave of true spot ETFs might not be far off.

A new report released on Wednesday from blockchain development platform Alchemy shows that the number of apps on self-described Ethereum layer 2 Polygon is growing at a rapid rate and that the ecosystem is increasingly becoming independent from projects on the Ethereum base layer.  More than 3,000 apps are now on the chain, up from just 30 last year, according to the report. Additionally, Alchemy has seen a 61% increase in the number of teams building on the chain month-over-month.  Polygon is growing “two times faster than Ethereum did at this point in its lifecycle,” Alchemy product manager Mike Garland said.  While Polygon is often referred to as a sidechain and developers are working to position it as a complement to Ethereum rather than a competitor, the data shows that the number of new Polygon-native apps is outstripping the number of apps deployed to both chains – possibly a sign of growing independence.  Of the new apps deployed to Polygon, only 38% are being built on both Polygon and Ethereum, versus 62% deployed exclusively on Polygon, according to Alchemy’s report.  Garland said that the data shows how projects that are ETH-native but also deploy to Polygon are growing in tandem with fully MATIC-native projects. MATIC is Polygon’s native token.  “I think the most interesting thing to me about this data is that we’re seeing both developing in parallel (roughly 4/10 using Polygon alongside Eth, 6/10 using just Polygon). There are certainly many teams that are launching and growing natively on Polygon, but also a substantial group using Polygon to deepen what they started in the Ethereum ecosystem and enable new use cases,” he said.

Stronghold Digital (SDIG), a bitcoin miner billing itself as an environmentally beneficial operator with access to cheap power, was up more than 60% from its initial public offering (IPO) price in its debut on Wednesday.  Among other crypto-related stocks, MicroStrategy (MSTR), often seen as a proxy for bitcoin because it holds so much of the digital currency on its balance sheet, climbed 5.8%, while crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) gained 2.8% and Robinhood Markets (HOOD), where many users trade crypto, fell slightly. The wider S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq composite were also in the green on Wednesday.  The share prices of crypto miners, which derive most of their revenue from mining digital currencies and tend to hold as many of the minted digital coins as possible on their balance sheets, are highly correlated with the price of bitcoin. In fact, according to Wall Street firm D.A. Davidson analyst Christopher Brendler, mining stocks are about 70% correlated to the price of bitcoin.  Recently, Brendler initiated research coverage of bitcoin miners with a bullish outlook for the sector and named Hut 8 his top pick. “Although Hut 8 isn’t yet as scaled, we see the most earnings upside in the group thanks to a brand new, low-cost 100 MW facility (with 35 MW set to come online 4Q21 and the rest in 2022). Combined with well-timing mining rig orders to fill up this new data center and the cheap valuation, Hut is our top pick here,” Brendler said.  Miners versus bitcoin itself  With more institutional investors coming into the sector and bitcoin’s continued rally, the natural question is “why buy the miners when you can buy the cryptocurrency itself?”  Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen answered the question in his Oct. 18 research report. “It’s a fair question, but upon exploration of the topic, we have observed that mining generally results in higher returns on multi-year periods of time,” Petersen wrote. His analysis showed that if someone bought a more recent mining computer, an S19 Pro, at the end of the first quarter of 2020, when the market spot price for the machine was $2,410, a mine-and-hold strategy would return 1,083% vs buying and holding bitcoin, which would return 764%.  On top of that, if a miner has access to cheap power, the returns are even greater, he added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/20/hive-leads-crypto-mining-stocks-higher-as-bitcoin-hits-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a30f66d7e8e002d3e2ebfabf3e88be0778e60d2f-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421716,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXpDTh,1634746909,Contango Conmigo: Why a Bitcoin Futures ETF Could Be a Bloody Ride,"Since at least 2013, when the Winklevoss twins first filed an application to create one, a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) has been the crypto industry’s white whale. An ETF would open bitcoin investment to a huge new array of players, from individual 401(k) users to major institutions, who can’t buy bitcoin directly for regulatory or compliance reasons. Yesterday, we finally got a bitcoin ETF … sort of.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO) is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and ProShares execs even rang the opening bell. They did it under a banner celebrating the first “U.S. Bitcoin-Linked ETF,” and therein lies a teachable moment for careful investors: “linked” is the kind of word that’s as fungible as a good currency, able to step in and do the work of dozens of lesser, more specific words.  In this case, the word being replaced is “futures” because rather than a fund that actually holds bitcoin the ProShares ETF will hold bitcoin futures contracts.  There’s huge irony to a futures ETF getting approved before a “real” bitcoin ETF. Regulators have broadly argued a futures ETF is less exposed to potential manipulation and custody risk in the bitcoin spot market – but the upshot could be massively missing gains for investors who buy the futures ETF instead of spot bitcoin.  The culprit is an issue known (for some reason) as “contango.” Investors in other commodities futures ETFs have been complaining about it for years, so we have a pretty good sense of how it works. I won’t get into the nitty-gritty here but the nut of it is that futures ETFs have to renew, or “roll,” their forward contracts regularly. If the longer futures price is higher than the expiring contract on the date of renewal, the fund loses that much basis. This loss is known as “contango bleed.” Here’s our deeper dive into contango risk, and an even deeper one from CenterPoint Securities.  (There is also an inverse phenomenon called “backwardation,” when the longer futures price is lower – but this seems less significant because it just gives futures ETF holders a small premium when the underlying commodity is already heading downward.)  These contango losses can be immense in conventional commodities, and may be truly gargantuan for bitcoin. In one snapshot noted by Motley Fool, a futures-based natural gas ETF stood to lose 1.5% on a single month’s roll. In larger markets, these spreads are often arbitraged out – professional traders can use them to make money and, in doing so, close the gaps. But as laid out by Bloomberg, crypto’s dominance by retail traders makes that arbitrage less robust. The current roll cost on BTC futures is a disemboweling 17%, according to Charlie Morris of ByteTree Asset Management. He expects the ETF to underperform spot longer term by 8.4% annually, before fees.  That sounds a lot like paying a jaguar good money to rip your face off. Tyrone Ross, a crypto-focused financial advisor, says retail investors should stay away from BITO.  Simeon Hyman, a strategist at ProShares, pushed back against Morris’s analysis yesterday on CoinDesk’s “All About Bitcoin’'. Hyman instead estimates an annualized 2.5% roll cost, and rightly points out that an expanding market could shrink the bleeding further. In any conventional asset, that would still be pretty brutal, but the expectation of continued upward movement for bitcoin could still make it worth it. Investors are certainly not being put off, with BITO attracting $570 million in inflows and a record-setting $1 billion in trading volume on day 1.  According to our reporting, that inflow seems to be substantially from retail investors. While some may be wise to contango risk, I guarantee many don’t even grok the difference between a futures and spot ETF. If they only notice the distinction after five or 10 years of contango bleed, there will be some truly biblical wailing and gnashing of teeth. Whether Morris’s or Hyman’s estimate is more on target, BITO will bleed buckets over a longer timeline.  I am not one of the single-minded trolls who think all regulation simply distorts markets, but it’s hard not to see some seriously perverse dynamics embodied in what regulators have brought to fruition here.

42376285,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4Jn,1634745162,How to Do Business as a DAO,"Every organization, of any kind, is organized in some way. So-called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are a new and different kind of organization: a collaboration among people in which members’ ownership, management and control are automated based on software.  Corporations are organized under the laws of a specific jurisdiction and require human involvement in their governance. DAOs, however, operate under a transparent set of software protocols – a pre-agreed set of governance rules, maintained and executed on a blockchain – that allow a distributed group of individuals or entities to self-govern. As a result, a DAO can function on a distributed basis with no central authority or decision maker.  Jason Gottlieb and Daniel Isaacs are partners, and Alexandra Wang an associate, at Morrison Cohen LLP, a law firm that compiles information on legal developments affecting DAOs and the blockchain sector. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s “Policy Week,” a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  While the law has long imposed the useful fiction of personhood on corporations – allowing them to sue or be sued, enter contracts and offer its members protection against liability – DAOs do not yet enjoy these privileges (for the most part). The clash between the growing popularity of DAOs on the one hand and the lack of legal protections and practicalities available to them on the other present DAOs, their lawyers and the courts with a host of execution and analytical challenges.  It will be vital to address how DAOs can participate in traditional commercial arrangements, hire service providers, resolve disputes, utilize U.S. courts to enforce their rights, defend against lawsuits, limit the liability of their members and partition assets, among other legal issues.  This article addresses two practical problems that DAOs face: how a DAO can enter a commercial contract, and how a DAO can engage and direct legal counsel to assist it in doing so.  Legal recognition  Without formal legal recognition, a DAO lacks a legal form with which to enter a contract like a traditional commercial enterprise. While a DAO may pass a governance proposal authorizing an individual to enter into a commercial arrangement on the DAO’s behalf (and concomitantly funding that arrangement), the representative appointed by the DAO might not automatically enjoy the limited liability that a corporate officer does.  There is a risk the DAO could be considered a general partnership or unincorporated association. This might expose its members to personal liability for any of the DAO’s actions and obligations, and discourage businesses, institutional investors, or other vulnerable or regulated entities from participating in DAOs.  Members of the DAO may also be unwilling to undertake responsibility to contract on behalf of the DAO for fear the law would impose fiduciary duties upon them or that their own assets would be put at risk.  One solution is for the DAO to authorize, through a formal governance vote, an individual or a group of individuals to create and capitalize a traditional corporate entity for the limited purpose of entering a corporate arrangement on behalf of the DAO.  Nevertheless, using such a “bridge entity” is inefficient, cumbersome and sacrifices many of the key benefits that make DAOs special. Instead, DAOs should, like other types of business associations, be free to enter into a contract directly, either through delegated authority or by passing a formal proposal. To the extent applicable state law would not permit a DAO to enter a traditional commercial arrangement without sacrificing its members’ personal liability, the law should be updated.  A few states have already begun to do so. Vermont, for instance, permits DAOs to register as blockchain-based limited liability companies. Wyoming, too, recently passed legislation providing liability protection for DAO members who organize as a limited liability company in the state.  We believe these trends will attract business and promote positive business policy, and additional states should follow suit to eliminate the uncertainties of contracting as a DAO.  For lawyers  The retention of, and relationship with, legal counsel also presents serious challenges for a DAO. For instance, while a DAO may pass a governance proposal to engage its selected lawyers, the DAO must be able to effectively and nimbly direct its counsel on a day-to-day basis, receive reports from legal counsel and preserve the confidentiality and privilege of attorney-client communications.  The solution here is likely delegation. In our experience, the most successful relationships between DAOs and their counsel are structured arrangements whereby the DAO passes a proposal to retain its chosen counsel, and delegates a scope of decision-making, reporting and communicative responsibility to a particular member or group of members.  In such circumstances, though, special attention must be paid by the DAO, its legal delegates and its counsel to protect the confidentiality and privilege of attorney-client communications (concerns that are a topic worthy of their own article).  See also: The Novel Legal Strategy Bringing This ICO-Backed ‘Micro-Mobility’ Startup to Court  A DAO is, like other entities, a useful tool to allow a widely dispersed and multi-jurisdictional group of individuals to privately and efficiently order their business arrangements. While blockchain-based governance is rapidly expanding, the law has been slower to catch up.  This should not discourage DAOs from participating in traditional commercial arrangements, exercising a right to legal counsel, utilizing U.S. courts and enjoying access to a variety of otherwise readily available financial and business resources. Through consultation with experienced counsel, DAOs can work within existing legal frameworks, while preserving their innovative technological solutions, and adapt to changing legislation or regulations.

42376284,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6A4IX,1634744507,What Stablecoins Might Become,"Identifying the ideal path to regulatory compliance for a stablecoin has been difficult. U.S. regulators have taken a much more active interest in the industry, though it is still not entirely clear what they will want stablecoins to be.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned about the risks stablecoins pose to the financial system and national security.  ”Depending on its design and other factors, a stablecoin may constitute a security, commodity or derivative subject to the U.S. federal securities, commodity and/or derivatives laws,” she said in a statement that certainly leaves some ambiguity. But regulators, however, should make their intentions clear in the next couple of months.  Bennett Tomlin, in his personal time, is a blogger and podcaster with an interest in stablecoins. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Policy Week, a forum for discussing how regulators are reckoning with crypto (and vice versa).  Opinions on the appropriate regulatory response to stablecoins vary from fitting these fiat-pegged digital assets into a money transmitter framework to treating issuers as banks. Some regulation enthusiasts believe there should be no space for stablecoins. Despite the disagreement and uncertainty around stablecoins, it’s clear that the $130 billion market has drawn the attention of powerful people.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler has suggested that “stable-value coins” may be securities. It seems clear that he is trying to tie them to stable-value funds, a fund design that the SEC already claims jurisdiction over. If stablecoins, or at least stablecoins backed by noncash assets, are securities, then they will no longer be useful for the things that they are now. It seems unlikely that they would be able to continue to move and trade unimpeded across censorship-resistant global networks.  Some cryptocurrency companies have taken a proactive approach to finding existing regulations they believe more adequately cover what their stablecoin would do. Avanti – a special purpose depository institution, which is a bank with only a state charter, a classification that was created under new legislation in Wyoming – seems to believe that the Uniform Commercial Code, which (in part) dictates standards for banknotes, would allow for the issuance of a “digital banknote.” If its token is considered a banknote, then it will be exempted from regulation as a security. That also may in part explain why digital asset company Paxos has a bank charter and payments company Circle wants one.  The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has issued guidance that makes it clear that banks are allowed to use stablecoins as part of their normal business, including payments, and that they can hold reserves for stablecoins. That suggests that stablecoin issuers may look like banks.  However, it may be difficult for depository institutions like Avanti to gain access to Federal Reserve master accounts. The Narrow Bank, an earlier proposed bank that would have parked its funds at the Federal Reserve and then passed on higher interest rates to depositors, hasn’t been able to get such access so far. Both Avanti and crypto exchange Kraken have applied for Federal Reserve access and so far neither has been accepted. Lack of access to the Federal Reserve payment rails would make running a stablecoin more difficult, or require Avanti and Kraken to rely on other service providers that do have access to the Fed through federally chartered banks.  A new piece of legislation known as the the STABLE Act would create a framework for stablecoins and other money transmitters where they would be obligated to keep all of their reserves at the Federal Reserve. Under a framework like the STABLE Act, there is a much better path toward a more narrow stablecoin issued by a bank.  There may still be significant legislative, regulatory and political hurdles related to effectively creating a new type of bank. Furthermore, the STABLE Act is not just limited to what those in cryptocurrency circles consider stablecoins, but would likely involve a wide array of money transmitters and may even change things for companies such as PayPal.  But it’s not just issuers that are eyeing the banking system as a model. Federal Reserve officials, such as Fed attorney Jeffery Zhang in his article ”Taming Wildcat Stablecoins,” have proposed bringing stablecoin issuers into the broader bank regulatory framework. While the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) is reportedly studying how to extend deposit insurance to stablecoins to help protect users. Meanwhile, the Biden administration has stated it thinks stablecoin issuer are at least “bank-like.”  The Digital Asset Market Structure and Investor Protection Act outlines a process where every stablecoin issuer must apply to the Treasury, at which point the Treasury checks with the Federal Reserve, the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and banks and decides whether to approve the stablecoin.  If that legislation passes (it’s now in committee in Congress), any unapproved stablecoin – including any digital asset pegged or collateralized significantly by a fiat currency – would then be unlawful. The bill, however, provides a path for approved stablecoins to avoid being considered a security.  It is difficult to say exactly how all of this will play out. My intuition is that a new type of banking charter will be created that will allow stablecoin issuers to access Fed master accounts and there will be an expectation that stablecoins will hold their reserves there. It also seems reasonably likely that the Treasury gets its way and stablecoin issuers will need to register with the Treasury. I expect that securities regulations may be part of the cudgel that will be used to help ensure that the only stablecoins are the “approved” stablecoins.  See also: Biden Administration Plans Cryptocurrency Sanctions to Combat Ransomware  The end result of this will likely be that any stablecoin issuer that wants to continue operating would need to become a bank and is going to have significantly less flexibility with what they can do with their reserves. Those that choose not to register or are not approved are likely to have difficulty accessing the U.S. banking system. They may have trouble servicing redemptions, and may perhaps even find themselves aggressively pursued by regulators.  The effect on the average crypto user is likely a degradation of their experience using stablecoins. However, there will be significantly greater certitude surrounding the backing and safety of the token, and regulators will no longer have to worry about them being an existential financial risk. In effect the government may take the private money that is stablecoins, and integrate it into the banking regulation framework so that it can become publicly guaranteed.

While the market’s attention is centered on the price of bitcoin hitting a new all-time high, the Ethereum co-founder grabbed some of Crypto Twitter’s attention after he sent trillions of canine-themed tokens away from his public wallet, according to blockchain data.  The tokens are knockoffs of dogecoin (DOGE), the memecoin represented by a Shiba Inu dog.  Notably, Buterin sent a majority of the tokens to decentralized exchange Uniswap, including 300 trillion jejudoge, more than 223 trillion kishu inu, 370 billion baby shiba and roughly 120 trillion huskytoken.  Despite the shockingly high numbers, none of the amounts was worth more than $800,000 at the time of the transactions, according to Etherscan.  In a permissionless system, all are welcome to send assets to publicly known addresses. What the recipient does with those assets also doesn’t require the permission of the sender.  At press time, most of these tokens were in deep red, according to CoinMarketCap. The loss for baby shiba was most significant: The token’s price was down nearly 70% in the past 24 hours.  Why did Vitalik Buterin dump SHIB?  It is no news in the crypto world that memecoin creators love to send large amounts of their tokens to Buterin. A pioneer in this marketing stunt is shiba inu (SHIB), a self-proclaimed “dogecoin killer.”  The Ethereum co-founder burned 90% of his SHIB holdings and donated most of the rest to charities after the project’s creator sent half of SHIB’s total supply to him without asking.  Read more: Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Complete Beginner’s Guide  Although SHIB initially suffered a dramatic price plunge, the coin has thrived ever since. According to CoinGecko, SHIB ranks as the 13th-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. That’s more value than UNI, the token of Uniswap, one of the most popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols on the Ethereum blockchain.  The motivation behind Buterin’s memetoken dump remains unknown but the move has not stopped others from sending him more dog-themed tokens.  As of press time, at least four other memecoins were sent to Buterin’s wallet including floki pup, saiba inu (not shiba inu) and misty inu.

When it comes to the custody of their crypto assets, users have a wide variety of options to choose from. Hot wallets such as desktop wallets, online wallets, and mobile wallets are always connected to the Internet. They are convenient, but highly risky because they are an easy target for hackers.

The firm said it “has doubts” about Tether’s backing and is launching the Hindenburg Tether Bounty Program to encourage a search for new information about it.  Hindenburg specifically highlighted in an announcement Wednesday Tether’s claims that a significant portion of its reserves are held in commercial paper without disclosing anything about its counterparties.  The program will enable users to submit information on Tether’s backing and earn rewards “in an amount up to $1 million,” Hindenburg said.  Regulatory scrutiny around the reserves that lie behind Tether’s stablecoin USDT and other similar instruments is well established. Hindenburg appears to be lending its weight to the work being carried out at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and on Capitol Hill.  In response, Tether labelled the bounty program “cynical” and a “pathetic bid for attention.”  “This is not the first time Hindenburg Research has orchestrated an apparent scheme in pursuit of profit. Nor will it be the last. Tether abhors and denounces their actions and transparent motives,” the stablecoin issuer said in a statement.  Hindenburg Research has in recent years garnered a reputation for uncovering information about publicly traded companies that sinks their share price and invites scrutiny from regulatory bodies. A report in June, for example, that suggested sports betting company DraftKings had potentially enabled black-market betting led to a subpoena from the SEC.

The company revealed it had secured approval to launch its bitcoin-linked ETF in a post-effective filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), indicating the SEC has given the company permission to launch its fund after Oct. 23, a Saturday. Trading will begin “as soon as practicable after the effective date,” which suggests Monday, Oct. 25.  “The Fund is an actively managed exchange-traded fund (’ETF’) that seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, in standardized, cash-settled bitcoin futures contracts (’Bitcoin Futures’) traded on commodity exchanges registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (’CFTC’), such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (the ‘CME’). The Fund does not invest in bitcoin or other digital assets directly,” the filing noted.  The SEC greenlit the first bitcoin futures ETF last week, according to a similar regulatory filing ProShares filed late Friday. The product began trading on Tuesday, immediately becoming one of the largest ETF debuts in U.S. history.  ProShares and VanEck’s approvals mark the first time U.S. investors can buy and trade shares of an ETF directly linked to bitcoin. The U.S. follows in the footsteps of Canada and certain European nations, which have allowed bitcoin ETFs and other exchange-traded products to go live already.  Canada allowed physically backed bitcoin ETFs to launch earlier this year, however, while the U.S. is still only allowing futures-linked ETFs to go live. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who opened the door for these products in August, has said in multiple public statements that he believes ETFs filed under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which govern the futures ETFs, provide stronger investment protections than the Securities Act of 1933, which governs physical ETFs.

The cryptocurrency pushed past the previous price record of $64,889 set in April and was changing hands at $66,685 as of 15:44 UTC (11:44 a.m. ET).

In the coming weeks, several more bitcoin futures-based ETFs may debut in the U.S., opening the potential for savvy U.S. crypto investors to partake in what is known as a “cash and carry” arbitrage strategy.  These ETFs would buy bitcoin futures contracts, on regulated venues such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), in an attempt to replicate the cryptocurrency’s price performance instead of purchasing actual bitcoin.

What exactly does this mean for the first-ever cryptocurrency and the current market cycle? Read on to find out. Bitcoin Price Sets New Record ATH Above $65,000 The number one ranked cryptocurrency by market cap has just set another major milestone, and proven to the market that the bull cycle isn&apos;t yet finished. It also means that the April 2021 &apos;top&apos; was nothing more than a mid-cycle pullback before the coin reached its final destination target closer to $100,000 or higher.

The recent Bitcoin ETF approval ended any second guessing or speculation over whether or not the bull market had ended, or if a bear market had began.

Polygon allows developers to build applications that integrate with the Ethereum mainnet, Bitwise highlighted in a statement Wednesday.  “For years, the excitement around crypto’s most promising use cases, including DeFi [decentralized finance] and NFTs [non-fungible tokens], has been muted by the fact that Ethereum simply isn’t built to handle it all yet,” Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s chief investment officer, said in a statement. Hougan sees Polygon as a platform to improve these issues.  Bitwise is the world’s largest crypto index fund manager, with over $1.2 billion in assets under management as of March 31, according to its website.  “We’re thrilled that a broader range of accredited and institutional investors will now be able to gain exposure to the MATIC token and help encourage greater development of the Polygon ecosystem,” Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal said in a statement.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | MATIC,Michael Bellusci,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/20/bitwise-launches-polygon-fund-for-ethereum-scaling-exposure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eeb95cf1f69e5f5231461cd9f676dadb2b9c636a-1300x928.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375997,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDS6z,1634734883,Polychain Leads $23M Bet on Startup Streamlining DeFi Portfolio Management,"Portfolio management in decentralized finance (DeFi) remains a highly manual and, at times, costly process, especially on platforms like Uniswap v3 where “concentrated liquidity” means that a user might have their position liquidated entirely to one side of a pair being traded.  However, Sommelier is working to change that. The Ethereum-based and soon-to-be Cosmos-managed co-processor for DeFi traders and liquidity providers (LPs), has raised $23 million in a round led by Polychain Capital, the team announced on Wednesday.  The round included participation from Byzantine Ventures, Tendermint Ventures, Secureware Capital, D1 Ventures, Ferngrove Ventures, Zola Ventures and Alameda Research.  Sommelier might roughly be thought of as a yield vault similar to Yearn.Finance: users deposit liquidity, and the platform uses the funds for automatically rebalancing Uniswap v3 positions, routing Uniswap trading fees to the depositor.  According to the press release, in the first six months since the launch of its “Pairings” product, “Sommelier has helped LPs place over $10 million in liquidity on Uniswap V3, which successfully generated over $2 million in fees for portfolio owners.”  Read more: Zaki Manian’s Sommelier Finance Raises $3.5M to Help DeFi Investors Avoid Impermanent Loss  Sommelier co-founder Zaki Manian, who refers to the platform as “Somm,” says the funds from the round will be used to continue development of the “Cellars” product, which is currently in prototyping. These upgradable contracts use a network of Cosmos-based validators to manage positions.  “Cellars gather data from people analyzing the Uniswap v3 pool to determine which strategies will be optimal,” Manian said. “The decision-making is diffused across a number of validators.”  The team expects validators will provide superior analysis and data feeds for positions via an incentivized network, and users can choose which validators get to manage the portfolio via a forthcoming governance token. Cellars will eventually expand to other DeFi platforms for strategies as well.  The multi-chain architecture is somewhat unusual, but Manian says it’s a natural development given the work that’s been done in the Cosmos ecosystem over the years.  “I’ve been working for the past five years in multi-chain system. Most people in Cosmos, they were working on token bridging in 2016. That’s done, that’s not exciting anymore – what we’re working on now is composability. ‘How do you take the strengths of different chains?’” he said.  Sommelier is currently internally discussing its token launch, Manian said, noting that a liquidity mining program could be in the works shortly after.  “30% of the token is in the community treasury. Expect to see governance proposals on which Cellars launch first, and a likely liquidity mining program,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | SPONSORED | UNI,Andrew Thurman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/20/polychain-leads-23m-bet-on-startup-streamlining-defi-portfolio-management,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36902b65eca4d2c797721ab43f6ddf6d603e426c-3970x2979.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42376000,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDS9V,1634729400,Ethereum’s ‘Difficulty Bomb’ Timing Hints at an Early Summer Merge,"This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.  During Ethereum Core Devs Meeting #124 on Oct. 15, a proposal to push December’s “difficulty bomb” was discussed. According to ETH Hub, the “Difficulty Bomb refers to a mechanism that, at a predefined block number, increases the difficulty level of puzzles in the proof-of-work mining algorithm resulting in longer than normal block times (and thus less ETH rewards for miners).”  In other words, it increases mining difficulty exponentially over time, eventually leading to an “Ice Age,” which would force the chain to stop producing blocks, essentially “freezing out” proof-of-work mining as Ethereum shifts to its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  Read more: What to Expect When Ethereum 2.0 Undergoes Its First ‘Hard Fork’  Most importantly, the date of the difficulty bomb gives insight into when the Merge is expected to occur, since it will disincentivize miners from continuing to mine Ethereum’s proof-of-work chain at that point.  Following the discussion on Friday, developers are now considering setting the effects of the difficulty bomb to take place in June 2022. That means the delay targets the Merge to take place before that date.  Since the code for the difficulty bomb was first introduced in 2015, it has been delayed four times.  Ethereum Project Manager Tim Beiko tweeted, “We think ~4 months is a generous timeframe from having the code done to seeing the Merge on mainnet.”  Once again, the difficulty bomb does not set the Merge’s date in stone. Beacon Chain developers and the client teams use the difficulty bomb to keep them on track. If they have to delay the bomb again it will eat at time they could be spending on the transition to proof-of-stake. However, if the bomb is set too far away it loses its utility of disincentivizing the proof-of-work chain. Thus, the projected date represents the best data point we can use to estimate when the developers feel they will be ready to deploy the necessary code for the Merge.  Follow @TimBeiko on Twitter for weekly summaries of the Core Devs Call or listen in on Friday mornings to hear more about the progress of Ethereum!  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.  Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  A Yearn developer and a MakerDAO delegate are attempting to bring the DeFi industry to the forefront of regulatory conversation. BACKGROUND: To battle crypto’s underrepresentation in the political arena, MakerDAO’s PaperImperium has begun lobbying and meeting with members of Congress, while Yearn’s Matt West is actually running for Congress. The duo’s grassroots approach could play a vital role in educating current policymakers about the inner workings of DeFi and its potential.  DraftKings is becoming further immersed in crypto with plans to become a Polygon validator. BACKGROUND: DraftKings first became involved in crypto through a Tom Brady NFT auction, using Polygon as its blockchain solution. As a validator, the company will be able to participate in governance, host NFT drops and earn yield on their token holdings. The move follows in the footsteps of Deutsche Telekom, which hosts a node for Chainlink and Flow blockchain.  The company behind Steam, an online gaming distribution platform, banned blockchain-based video games from listing on its platform. BACKGROUND: Blockchain-based games and the play-to-earn model have drawn the attention of investors, gamers and regulators. While Axie Infinity proved the viability of the model, marketplaces and platforms like Steam are wary of the implications of trading assets with real world value. A competitor, Epic Games, was quick to take the other side, welcoming blockchain games on their platform.  The stock market reacted positively to Coinbase’s coming NFT marketplace with shares jumping 6%. BACKGROUND: Coinbase had 1.35 million users sign up for its NFT platform, over 4x the user base of OpenSea. NFTs have been one of the most popular areas within crypto recently, with OpenSea and Axie Infinity being the largest two revenue drivers and accounting for a majority of the transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain.  Subversive Capital filed an application for a metaverse ETF that would allow investors to gain exposure to the “next generation of the internet.” BACKGROUND: While the crypto community is celebrating the newly launched bitcoin ETF, Subversive is focusing on another crypto niche and its ensuing cultural revolution. The ETF would invest in companies building the infrastructure of the metaverse and trade under the ticker PUNK. The ETF could give investors a chance to gain exposure to the growing NFT market and its use cases from art to gaming.

Ether’s rally from September lows has stalled near the trendline resistance (above left).  A convincing close higher may revive the uptrend, opening doors for a re-test of May highs near $4,400.  The relative strength index (RS) is well short of above 70 or overbought levels, implying scope for a continued move to the higher side.  Bitcoin narrowly missed the lifetime high of $64,801 early today and was last seen trading near $63,850.  The immediate bias remains bullish as the uptrend line from September lows is intact.

42375984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDRpN,1634726374,Russian Oil Companies Want to Mine Crypto on Flare Gas: Report,"Russia’s Ministry of Digitalization and the Bank of Russia have been asked for official comments on the idea that oil companies might open mining farms on their oil rigs, using flare gas to generate power.  Vasily Shpak, the deputy head of Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade, asked the agencies to clarify their positions on the matter, Russian newspaper Kommersant wrote on Wednesday.  The Ministry of Industrial Development told Kommersant that the idea came from the oil and gas companies themselves. They suggested getting regulatory approval to mine crypto using flare gas for electricity generation. Shpak’s letter also suggests that Russia starts manufacturing devices for turning flare gas into energy, Kommersant wrote.  Flare gas is a byproduct of oil extraction and is usually burnt, which is a liability for oil-extracting companies and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  The idea to seek approval came from one of the country’s major oil and gas companies, which already has a small mining farm using flare gas, but wants to expand it, an unidentified source “close to the Ministry of Industry and Trade” told Kommersant. Russian law, however, currently doesn’t regulate mining business.  The only Russian oil company to publicly launch a mining farm is Gazpromneft. In December 2020, the company said it was starting a pilot mining venue on one of its oil fields in Siberia, CoinDesk wrote.  At the time, a Gazpromneft representative told CoinDesk that the company wasn’t planning to mine crypto for its own reserves, but would provide a venue for other miners. Mining firm Vekus became its first client and mined 1.8 BTC using 49,500 cubic meters of gas during one month last fall, according to Russian crypto news outlet Forklog.  Last summer, Russia passed a law classifying cryptocurrencies as a taxable property. It did not, however, explain any practical matters related to crypto, as to how crypto businesses should operate in Russia or how people are supposed to declare and pay crypto-related taxes. These issues still have to be clarified by the future laws.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | COMMODITY | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/10/20/russian-oil-companies-want-to-mine-crypto-on-flare-gas,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f74b4c5a4fc880f360b5bae46c8163e9f64dbc5a-1500x998.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375999,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDS5j,1634724209,Bitcoin Options Open Interest Tops $14B as ProShares ETF ‘BITO’ Goes Live,"Investor interest in the bitcoin options market increased, with the cryptocurrency nearing record highs in the lead up to Tuesday’s launch of the first-ever U.S.-based bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund (ETF).  Bybt data shows the cumulative dollar value of bitcoin options contracts open on major exchanges rose to $14 billion on Tuesday, hitting the highest point since April. The tally was a whisker away from the peak of $14.68 billion reached on March 24.  Open interest, or the number of contracts traded but not squared off with an offsetting position, rose to a six-month high of 229,220 BTC.  Bitcoin reached a record UTC close above $64,000 on Tuesday as the ProShares’ ETF made an impressive debut on the New York Stock Exchange, registering a trading volume of $1 billion.  Hopes the U.S. would approve a futures-based ETF strengthened late last month after Securities Exchange and Commission (SEC) Chairman Gary Gensler reiterated support for the structured product. Since then, the price of bitcoin has rallied over 40%, and options open interest has increased by 50%.  The pickup in options activity in the days leading up to the SEC’s decision on ETF proposal signifies increased participation by sophisticated investors and market maturity.  “An extremely rare occurrence for Bitcoin is the Event-driven trade, observed as Futures ETF deadlines approached and then approved. Options are a perfect tool to employ in these scenarios,” Deribit Insights tweeted. Deribit is the world’s largest crypto options exchange, accounting for more than 80% of open interest and trading volume in bitcoin and ether options markets.  Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to buy and the put option gives the right to sell. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buyer is bearish.  Seasoned traders often use both calls and options when the outcome of a binary event (a trigger for a big move), is uncertain, but a move in either direction is expected. However, flows have been predominantly bullish ahead of the ProShares’ ETF listing, with traders piling into out-of-the-money or higher strike call options, as blockchain data analytics firm Glassnode mentioned in its weekly report published Monday.  “The favored options contracts appear to be call options with strike prices above $100,000, with a typical open interest of $250 million to $350 million for call options expiring at the end of the year. The open interest in call options dwarfs that in put options, aligning with the overall bullish market sentiment,” Glassnode said.  Over-the-counter tech platform Paradigm recently registered continuous buying of topside calls and call spread strategies at strikes between $70,000 to $120,000. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit.  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Fund saw a trading volume of $1 billion on Tuesday, becoming the second-most heavily traded new ETF on record, according to Bloomberg data.  “Volumes were pretty much right on the screws where the “ETF Nerds” had been predicting – about $1 billion,” David Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research of ETF Trends, said in a Twitter response. “The nature of that volume seems to be [coming from] the small lot, implying retail investors, speculators and high-frequency traders rather than large institutional allocations.”  According to Bloomberg analysts, Valkyrie’s futures-based bitcoin ETF may commence trading later this week.  The launch of futures-based ETFs could have a positive impact on the derivatives market. “CME options are currently a very small part of the whole crypto options market. Perhaps we could see some growth and development in CME options as a result,” QCP Capital said in its Telegram channel last week.  On Tuesday, the CME accounted for 2.7% of the global bitcoin options open interest of 229,220 BTC.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/20/bitcoin-options-open-interest-tops-14b-as-proshares-etf-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/db962f97f2f01b69d422733d8eceaaef05d34b79-1400x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

One NFT will be given for free to anyone who signs up for the company’s Discovery conference between Oct. 19 and Nov. 22. If they invite more people to attend, they can collect more NFTs to form the full set.  The seven NFTs will not be released after Nov. 22, but users will be able to transfer them to others.

42415731,WkWFu5l5TZXnF1B32UXJXl,1634697343,ProShares Bitcoin Futures ETF ‘BITO’ Hauls In $570M of Assets in Stock-Market Debut,"The first-ever exchange-traded fund (ETF) backed by bitcoin futures hauled in some $570 million of assets on its first day of trading, a sign of just how hungry investors remain for bets on the cryptocurrency as prices approach a record high.  ProShares, the fund’s sponsor, announced the level of assets in an emailed notice from a press representative. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Fund, which launched Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker BITO, had $20 million of seed capital at the start of the day.  The fund also saw about $1 billion of trading volume on the first day, ProShares said. That made it the second-most heavily traded new ETF on record, the firm said, citing Bloomberg.  The fund’s price rose to $41.94 at the close of stock-market trading, up 4.9% from the initial $40 net asset value.  Dave Nadig, chief investment officer and director of research of ETF Trends, said that much of Tuesday’s trading volume appeared to come from retail investors, since there were few large “block” trades of the size that big institutional traders often deal in.  “This is probably going to be what we all expected, which is it’s an access vehicle for certain players in the marketplace,” Nadig said in a phone interview. “There’s lots of folks who are active participants in the markets who just don’t want to cross over the crypto bridge by themselves.”  Bullish signal  The new ETF’s debut came as bitcoin’s price surged Tuesday to a six-month high, climbing toward the all-time high near $65,000 set in April.  As of press time, the cryptocurrency was changing hands around $63,839, up 3.3% over the past 24 hours.  Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise Asset Management, said in emailed comments that the strong first-day showing “suggests there is a large amount of capital that is still excluded from the crypto market simply because it’s hard to access.”  “That will change over time, and that capital will enter the market,” Hougan said. “That’s a pretty bullish signal for the long term.”  Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of Arca Funds, wrote in a newsletter Tuesday that “this was a long, arduous road for many, and becomes yet another indication that digital assets are crossing into mainstream.”  The first of its kind in the U.S., the ProShares ETF offers investors the opportunity to gain exposure to returns of bitcoin with the ease of buying an ETF in a brokerage account.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the ETF on Friday, and several other pending ETF proposals could win approval from the SEC later this week.  The ProShares ETF is structured to invest in bitcoin futures contracts traded on the Chicago-based CME, rather than investing in the cryptocurrency directly.  So the ETF by itself won’t introduce any new demand for bitcoin. However, traders might buy more bitcoin as they look to hedge against the futures price or take advantage of pricing disparities.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/19/first-bitcoin-futures-etf-bito-nears-1b-trading-volume-on-first-day,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/412553f26deb3048548a62131dcbb268b6baa8d4-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company, part of BC Group, a public technology and digital asset company, will provide institutional customers with “access to a global liquidity pool,” the company said.  Fernando Martinez, OSL’s head of Americas, told CoinDesk the company was addressing the growing demand for crypto services among institutional investors in Latin America and will serve regional funds, family offices and private banks.  “Until the end of the year, we have removed fees for professional investors and institutions that want to start interacting with our exchange,” Martinez said, adding that the exchange does not operate with local currencies but directly with U.S. dollars.  In recent months, large financial services firms in the region have launched a number of investment products. In June, blockchain investment firm QR Capital started trading its bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on the Brazil stock exchange. A month later, the firm listed an ether ETF on the same exchange after winning approval from regulators.  Earlier this month, the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV) announced it is considering listing crypto futures on its derivatives exchange.  Martinez said OSL, the first and only digital asset company licensed by Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission, would compete against regional platforms that are currently providing similar services.

42375989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwDRt9,1634690749,Wormhole Adds User Interface Support for Terra’s Network,"Wormhole, a communication bridge between Solana and other top decentralized finance (DeFi) networks, has added user interface support for the Terra network.  The move allows users to port digital assets between the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum, Solana and Terra networks with a single unified interface without the need to “double wrap” Terra tokens.  Like stablecoins whose values are pegged to fiat currencies or particular commodities, wrapped tokens fulfill a similar function by representing real-world assets on networks they aren’t native to. “Wrapping” refers to storing particular digital assets in a wrapper or digital vault so that they may function on one blockchain even if they were issued on a different blockchain.  In order to allow assets to exchange value across multiple chains, tokens often need to be double wrapped – which can prove costly and time-consuming.  “By allowing value to flow freely throughout decentralized networks, Wormhole is opening the door for use cases that were previously unattainable,” Hendrik Hofstadt, director of special projects - crypto at Jump Trading, said in a press release on Tuesday.  “Now, cross-chain governance, liquid staking tokens, oracle data being passed over multiple chains and the ability to avoid double wrapping tokens are all within a user’s reach,” Hofstadt said,  Wormhole’s interoperability protocol enables crypto assets like tokens and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and even price data, to flow between blockchain networks that don’t usually talk to each other. When it was launched, the protocol supported the Binance Smart Chain, Ethereum and Terra.  Read more: ‘Wormhole’ Launches for Connecting DeFi on BSC, Terra and Ethereum to Solana  Previously, Terra’s stablecoin, UST, and Luna, the native crypto powering Terra’s ecosystem, passed through Wormhole V1, but upon reaching the Solana network, they became double wrapped.  The addition of Terra support to Wormhole’s already existing Ethereum-Solana-BSC token bridge means the four largest DeFi blockchains by total value locked, or the amount invested in a DeFi platform, can now “flow freely,” according to the press release.  The support comes on the heels of Terra’s recent Colombus-5 upgrade which enabled the network to function more seamlessly with other crypto ecosystems.  Terra also said it will be shuttering its Ethereum bridge, Shuttle, and drive liquidity toward Wormhole, which already has $350 million in total value locked, according to the protocol’s own data.

The move comes just after the SEC cleared the way on Friday for bitcoin futures ETFs to trade, with ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF scheduled to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.  GBTC first launched in 2013 and has become the largest bitcoin investment vehicle in the world, with assets under management of close to $40 billion. It holds roughly 3.44% of all bitcoin in circulation, according to Grayscale.  Grayscale has talked repeatedly about its plans to convert GBTC, as well as its 14 other crypto trusts, into ETFs.  Grayscale’s ETF would be backed by actual units of the cryptocurrency, not simply linked to it via derivatives contracts such as futures. If the SEC approves the proposal, it would be a further expansion of the leading cryptocurrency as a recognized investable asset.  Some analysts feel the likelihood of Grayscale getting approval of a bitcoin spot ETF anytime soon is slim, given SEC chair Gary Gensler’s often-stated preference for a futures product that might confer more investor protections.  The SEC will now have 75 days to review Grayscale’s application.  Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.

The fund, from Galaxy Interactive, which scouts gaming and arts startups for Mike Novogratz’s crypto conglomerate, has been investing in projects such as Art Blocks for months now, General Partner Sam Englebardt told CoinDesk.  “What would you invest in if you believe that the younger generations, in particular, are moving en masse from the physical to the digital world?” Englebardt said in an interview, noting that Galaxy Interactive has showered $150 million on projects accordingly.  If non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and other crypto tech are to form the backbone of this coming metaverse, then Galaxy wants its share of the spine. The same goes for gaming, blockchain or no.  Englebardt was hesitant to label Galaxy Interactive’s strategy a “metaverse” play, however. The term, which refers to virtual worlds users can interact with, is fast becoming a buzzword. He called it “confusing,” in part because it is growing increasingly ill-defined.

Gaming is a critical part of Galaxy Interactive’s playbook. It participated in 1047 Studios, the company behind a popular free-to-play shooter title, and Elodie Games, which is building a cross-platform gaming experience. Neither are crypto-first.  High-brow digital art projects have also found Galaxy Interactive’s blessing. Masterworks, a securitized art startup with a $1 billion price tag, is a portfolio company.
