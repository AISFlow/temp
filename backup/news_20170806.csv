42379685,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUjR,1502039435,Four Quadrants – Dividing and Conquering the Crypto Universe,"Hu Liang is the former head of emerging technology at State Street, and the founder of a new blockchain stealth startup 'Project Omni.'  In this opinion piece, Liang attempts to segment the blockchain technology market, breaking down the different use cases and opportunities he believes will eventually develop, and charting a course forward for its likely development.      I've been fortunate to have spent the past two-plus years looking at bitcoin, blockchain, crypto and everything related.  The market has definitely changed and shifted during this period. However, what I still find lacking is a clear and concise way of looking at all the opportunities in this crypto space. I still find myself explaining the difference between bitcoin and blockchain, and proof-of-work and consensus.  And many still have the impression that institutions can function under the same trust premise as consumers and retailers.  Here is a model I came up with to explain how I see the various opportunities and their differences. I hope you find this model informative and useful.  Of course, this is but one model from one person, so feel free to agree, object and generally comment. I look forward to hearing your perspective.  Two axes  I look at the entire crypto space from two axes.  On one axis, we have the major innovations, crypto assets on one end (bitcoin, ethereum and other tokens) juxtaposed with blockchain (the underlying technology that makes crypto assets possible). The other axis is focused on the audience, consumer and retail versus the institutional space.  Together, we end up with four quadrants that explain where the opportunities lie. Each quadrant, therefore, represents the opportunities the innovation brings to that particular audience.  The model… let's follow the numbers…  This is where it all began with bitcoin, and it now represents all the coins or tokens available to the consumer and retail market. Opportunities here are many, and they will develop at varying speeds based on use.  Broadly speaking, I’m putting them into three sub buckets:  A medium of exchange or new form of payment rail – a cryptocurrency – like bitcoin, zcash or Ripple's XRP.  A digital store of value – a crypto-commodity – like a digital gold.  A new ownership model – crypto-equity – through the ""usage token paradigm"" created by initial coin offerings (ICOs).  This genesis quadrant, through the growth and development of all three buckets in succession, through arguably ICOs as the main future driver, have really sparked the tremendous growth we've seen in the last six month.  Of course, there are many other factors like Japan's national regulation of the industry and explosion in crypto exchanges. But no doubt this quadrant with consumer driven demand and innovation is what’s powering the growth of our new crypto world.  2. Decentralized infrastructure  This quadrant, I think, in the long run could be the most disruptive.  This is truly building decentralized infrastructures and services out of platforms like ethereum, new competing platforms like Tezos and others being created. This quadrant represent the technologies the tokens actually fuel.  Possibilities here are endless, but it could be difficult for the institutional space to adopt given the unstructured nature, lack of governance and difficulty to regulate. This is the ""fat protocol"" concept so well explained by Joel Monegro while at USV.  Quadrants one and two are clearly related, not only because they both focus on the consumer and retail segment, but because the new infrastructures being created by quadrant two are driving opportunities of quadrant one… or vise versa depending on your perspective and argument, I suppose.  If this quadrant really matures and takes off, many of the companies we know so well today like Amazon AWS, Google, Box and Facebook might dramatically change or even disappear. It's difficult to imagine given all the unknowns.  Therefore, this is possibly the most interesting long-term disruptive opportunities of all four quadrants.  3. A new technology stack  Ah… blockchain, the word used so much to describe disruption in the last two to three years in the institutional financial world, the one that spawned the creation of the Linux-led Hyperledger project, R3, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and countless blockchain-related startups.  While development in this space will undoubtedly continue, I think the institutional segment is generally realizing blockchain will be a new technology stack as opposed to a business model transforming force.  Just look at the similarities of the technical architecture diagrams compared to the J2EE stack of late 1990s.  Banks in general will use blockchain to replace aging infrastructure that's been accumulating for decades. While industry wide efforts exist, initial use cases will be narrow in scope focusing on specific inefficient and costly processes.  Only after wider adoption by the industry, I believe interoperability will emerge and broader connectivity via blockchain across use cases and sectors will materialize. Industry-wide scale and broad interoperability will be on the scale of 5–10 years.  4. A new asset class  The fourth quadrant is perhaps the most interesting from a capital markets perspective in the near term. This segment really didn't exist two to three years ago.  Financial institutions didn't really look at bitcoin back then, eschewing the anarchist, world-currency concept for the more grounded innovation of blockchain.  But the dual effect of realizing the third quadrant will take longer to mature (and that the burgeoning first quadrant represents more than just bitcoin) led the institutional financial market to determine that the crypto space is developing into its own asset class.  This latest quadrant development can really drive the overall adoption of crypto in the broader market by creating a healthy investment and trading market.  If the requisite infrastructure existed today to allow institutional players, market makers, OTC brokers, quant funds and even traditional asset managers to easily transact and store crypto assets, the movement can dramatically spur further growth and development in all three other quadrants.  Two paths  I see this market moving forward on two paths – both started on the same initial trajectory but are currently growing for different reasons.  The initial starting trajectory is from quadrant 1 to quadrant 3. This was evident when banks in 2014 and 2015 started in earnest to focus on blockchain and consciously downplayed the value of bitcoin.  Three years into this effort, the market is realizing that blockchain technology will eventually save costs in the institutional financial world and save us from decades of technology debt in the form of mainframe, legacy databases, custom implementations and other programatic contraptions.  But, it's clear that blockchain tech in the institutional space will not come in the near term.  So, all the investments from VCs and institutions that were going after blockchain in the institutional space are looking for new avenues to deploy. These new paths will soon lead us to see tremendous developments and growths in quadrants two and four.  As I stated above, I think quadrant two is the most disruptive in the long run because it has the potential to change the way computational value is distributed in the world. Changes of this magnitude takes time, even with internet speed.  Recall the ""Bitcoin Maximalist"" concept of a few years ago, where many thought bitcoin would be the chain to rule them all. Two years later we have hundreds of coins competing for our money and attention.  (So much so that VC and hedge funds are creating investment vehicles specially because we don’t know which will be the winner.)  But the concept will win. The internet ushered in the free exchange of information, and blockchain, with the right tokenization structure and application, can indeed usher in the free exchange of value, it will just take time.  The safe bet  Time, however, is a valuable asset and many people prefer not to wait so long, particularly capital markets. That leads me to the second path of development, institutions moving from blockchain to the crypto asset class, quadrant four.  The question of ""What is blockchain?"" and ""How is it useful?"" are changing to ""What is this cryptocurrency?"" or ""How can I trade and custody crypto?""  There is a shift in the institutional world to own and trade this asset class. Articles and books have been written about why crypto is a new asset class.  Indeed, if you believe my portrayal of crypto values in the genesis quadrant, then you can see crypto has characteristics of many asset classes and therefore deserves to be classified as its own. There is a lot of demand in this space, unfortunately liquidity is fragmented and the infrastructure is designed mostly for retail users.  We will see faster developments in this quadrant as use-cases and value of crypto-asset increase. The requisite infrastructure can be accomplished without the need of blockchain, so we can likely see adoption on more near-term timeframe.  Again, this is but the view of one person. Even my own views are developing and changing as I learn from experimentations and conversations, but I'm about to go head first into quadrant four.

42379675,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUad,1502032218,A 'Howey Test' for Blockchain? Why the SEC's ICO Guidance Isn't Enough,"After years of waiting for the SEC to give formal guidance on cryptocurrencies and their close blockchain relative, cryptosecurities, the regulatory agency in charge of protecting investors and ensuring the integrity of markets last month unleashed a trove of documents.  Amidst the 18 pages of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) report detailing what makes a token a security was a statement from its division of corporate finance, an investor bulletin, and most notably, a decision that tokens issued by ethereum project The DAO qualified as securities.  First and foremost among the lessons gleaned from these documents was that not all ICOs constitute the issuance of securities. Second, and of perhaps more widespread significance, is that the SEC found that ICO trading should only be conducted on national exchanges, such as Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.  Anyone hoping for more clear guidance is being advised to have their lawyer contact the agency directly. The regulator even provided a specific email address.  The irony here is that for the first time ever individual entrepreneurs working in garages and community work spaces around the world are being empowered through blockchain to build technologies with the power to disrupt a variety of global financial infrastructures. But the lawyers they need to build these tools compliantly remain the exclusive partners of the establishment and venture-funded startups.  Perhaps of even greater significance though, not only have these individuals been empowered to create financial platforms capable of doing what only banks could have done before, but for the first time, ever large numbers of blue collar workers were given the ability to commit white collar crime — on purpose, or not.  By failing to understand that the people most likely to violate the SEC regulations do not have legal representation, and by failing to communicate clear tests, the regulator is setting the stage for an explosion of prosecutions against young people who have the power to create these disruptive technologies.  Principles-based framework  Historically, the SEC has conveyed its regulatory policies, and even its interpretation of those policies through orders, rules, opinions, administrative proceedings, amicus briefs and the complaints it files in federal district courts.  Questions about nuance, interpretation or misunderstandings are, in turn, deferred to the lawyers who may or may not take the matter to the SEC in a formal capacity.  For those who read the report published last month, and finished wondering if what they created might put them afoul of the guidance, the SEC explicitly encouraged them ""to consult with securities counsel to aid in their analysis of these issues.""  But the problem with what the SEC calls a ""principles-based framework"" is that principles change, and some technologies change them. In the instance of blockchain, it appears to be an example of exactly such a technology.  Since the first blockchain, bitcoin, was unveiled in 2009, banks that had been fierce competitors are forming friendly-seeming consortia designed to better capitalize on the potential benefits of a shared ledger. Likewise, governments that have traditionally relied on the issuance of currencies to fund their agendas and control inflation are even learning to play nicely with cryptocurrencies.  In other words, principles are being changed by the idea that a technology can serve the role of a trusted third party, and they are being changed by young people writing in new computer languages and using new open-source technologies available for free to the public.  These builders frequently do not have lawyers, they almost never have investors and their advisors might just as well be high school teachers. Wish as we might for an easy-to-use, affordable application that translates blockchain features into the language of the 71-year-old Howey test for determining securities, no such technology yet exists.  New principles  To the SEC's credit, the regulatory body exhibited restraint in the way it reveled its first formal guidance to the industry. But being slow to implement potentially aging principals-based regulation isn't the same as adapting to changing principles.  While other regulators such as the New York State Department of Financial Services and its 2015 ""BitLicense"" appear to have rushed in their attempt to establish early industry precedence, and implemented a more prescriptive regulatory solution, the SEC took its time in spite of formal requests for clarity.  One such request even went so far as to ask that the SEC create of a ""regulatory sandbox"" for innovators to safely experiment without fear of being prosecuted.  In the interim, the SEC assembled a distributed ledger working group consisting of at least 75 people and hosted public meetings with blockchain leaders to learn more about industry demands and trajectory.  These and other methods of gathering information and customizing guidance have worked well for the regulator since the Securities Act was first established in 1933 in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  Nevertheless, the mandate to create financial transparency, and ensure the reliability of corporate information that resulted from that earlier collapse failed to prevent the rampant fraud that helped contribute to the loss of 8.5 million jobs in the U.S. alone in what is now called the Great Recession.  Within a year of that collapse, blockchain had emerged, thick with allusions to the resulting broken trust in the financial status quo.  Empowered by the bitcoin blockchain that now supports $44.5 billion worth of cryptocurrency, the world was invited to copy its open-source code and improve it, with other platforms for wildly different distributed ledgers to follow.  But the trouble these blockchain builders will get into if they fail to comply with the SEC guidance published last month won't just cost them money, it will cost the SEC money. The final cost of pursuing penalties against violators who can ill-afford the exorbitant fines typically charged by the SEC will be passed onto taxpayers, regardless of whose fault the violation actually is.  Clarity is even more important now that anyone can build potentially non-compliant technology.  The student becomes the master  Undoubtedly, the SEC's decision to rely on lawyers to sort through the guidance is intended to ensure it doesn't accidentally give its blessing to an application that complies with the word of the regulation, but violates its principles.  It must have been an unsettling prospect to the regulators that in saying anything at all, they might accidentally set a standard that they would only later find out could not be enforced. But it is exactly for this potential difficulty of enforcing violations that more clarity is needed, not less.  After all, blockchain innovators were first attracted to the technology because after the Great Recession, they stopped trusting third parties to look after their best interests, even while others sought to subvert the system to malicious ends.  But in either case, these builders are not the typical citizens the SEC is used to dealing with.  For example, in the case of The DAO, the founders of the company who wrote the code on which it was based (but who have denied on the record that they actually launched the code) will not be prosecuted, according to the report.  It is widely presumed that the small group of coders who initially set out to raise funds for the project were not prosecuted because the investors in The DAO were ""made whole"" in the aftermath of a controversial ethereum hard fork that will be difficult, or impossible to duplicate.  Nevertheless, to this day, hacks in which investors are not made whole continue to mount, with dozens having already occurred. These are not the typical recipients of SEC fines who regularly pay tens of millions of dollars in penalties for irresponsible behavior, but who do not serve prison time.  These are a new class of innovators capable of creating incredibly powerful financial instruments far from well-capitalized Wall Street. These are the people who began building financial platforms as a result — directly or otherwise — of what they perceived to be a failure of the SEC's framework built on its own aging principles of transparency.  In this light, the inadequate communication of simple straightforward principles can be seen as a failure to understand that the new principles being created are already trickling upward, changing the way even the highest levels of the global financial infrastructures are being run.
