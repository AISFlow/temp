A handful of small countries – the Bahamas, Nigeria – have launched fiat digital currencies, but more than 30 nations are developing or pilot testing them, including China. Last week, the city of Shenzhen in southern China announced $4.5 million in digital yuan as stimulus payments to residents to counter the negative economic effects of the pandemic. The U.S. is considering a digital dollar, but Federal Reserve Vice Chair Lael Brainard said recently it would take approval from the Biden administration and Congress, and would take at least five years to materialize. At this year’s Consensus festival in Austin, Texas, from June 9-12, some of the biggest names and most vibrant minds will come together to debate issues in the rapidly changing financial ecosystem.

35463,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238199,1654126209,Mina: World’s Lightest Blockchain Using zk SNARKs,"Mina is the first cryptocurrency with a succinct blockchain. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum currently contain hundreds of gigabytes of data, and their blockchains will only grow in size as time goes on. What is Mina Protocol? However, no matter how popular Mina becomes, the blockchain will always have the same size - around 22kb (the size of a few tweets). As a result, participants will be able to swiftly sync and test the network. zk-SNARKs, a sort of succinct cryptographic zero-knowledge proof, have enabled this achievement. When a Mina node creates a new block, it also creates a SNARK proof verifying its validity. The short evidence, rather than the complete chain, can then be stored by all nodes. The Mina protocol offers a decentralised at scale blockchain by eliminating the need to care about block size. As blockchains grow in size, validating data on the blockchain becomes more complex, resulting in the concentration of validators. Mina aims to circumvent this constraint by employing a &apos;simple blockchain,&apos; which requires a fixed amount of time and data to verify the present status of the world (20 kilobytes/10 milliseconds), according to the developers. The recursive composition of zk-SNARKs, which use constant-sized proofs of arbitrary, incremental computations, enables the concise blockchain. This means that the difficulty of verifying the chain is unaffected by its size, retaining the ease with which users...",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MINA,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/mina-worlds-lightest-blockchain-using-zk-snarks/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mina-worlds-lightest-blockchain-using-zk-snarks,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

Irresponsible for the crypto winter of recent months that saw most cryptocurrencies lose most of their previous gains, the return on investment on SHIB stands at 731880% according to CoinMarketCap. This means that the initial investors are having $7318.8 for each $1 investment. This rise led to a strong positive sentiment towards the altcoin Shiba Inu (SHIB) which in some quarters is called &apos;Doge Killer.&apos; This sentiment led to the rise of SHIB to $0.00008845 on October 28, 2021, according to CoinMarketCap. Many investors were optimistic that the price would rise further. This has not been the case, since SHIB is trading at $0.00001173 with 24 hours decreased by 0.15%. This means that the price of SHIB has reduced by 650% in the past 7 months. With the launch of a platform where Shiba Inu (SHIB) holders, will be rewarded for burning SHIB, the SHIB community had soon low response to it. This can be seen with the decrease in the price of SHIB by 42% in the past 30 days.

The change in CFO comes as the shares of the miner have fallen about 72% this year, in line with its peers Core Scientific (CORZ) and Marathon Digital (MARA). The bitcoin mining industry has been rocked by bitcoin's (BTC) declining price since November.  On May 10, Riot reported its first-quarter earnings.

Bankman-Fried’s fortune is valued at $21 billion by Forbes, making him among the wealthiest individuals minted by the crypto market boom.  The bulk of Bankman-Fried’s wealth comes from his equity stake in crypto exchange FTX. FTX last closed a $400 million fundraising round in January, which valued the company at $32 billion.  “A while ago I became convinced that our duty was to do the most we could for the long run aggregate utility of the world,” wrote Bankman-Fried in his pledge letter. “In the end, it’s the work my friends and colleagues at foundations do that matters the most.”  The billionaire crypto founder is a longtime effective altruist, a philosophy that advocates for maximizing the amount of good generated when considering donations to charity.  In recent years, Bankman-Fried has built up a reputation for writing big checks, most notably donating to political campaigns. This includes a record-setting $12 million to fund effective altruism-aligned candidate Carrick Flynn. Last month, Flynn lost in the Oregon Democratic congressional primaries.  To date, the FTX Foundation, FTX’s philanthropic arm, has earmarked $21.8 million to charity.  Coinbase (COIN) founder Brian Armstrong, worth an estimated $2.8 billion, signed the pledge in 2018.  Founded in 2010, the Giving Pledge was created by Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates and ex-wife Melinda Gates together with investor Warren Buffet to encourage greater giving from the ultra-wealthy.  To date, the pledge counts 230 signatories from 28 different countries. Other prominent pledgers include Meta (FB) founder Mark Zuckerberg, BitMEX co-founder Ben Delo and Tesla’s (TSLS) CEO Elon Musk.

42411786,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfzUM,1654119472,What Is Tether? How USDT Works and What Backs Its Value,"Tether issues one of the most popular and widely used cryptocurrencies on the crypto market, a stablecoin called tether (USDT).  Tether the protocol is closely connected to the crypto exchange Bitfinex as it shares the same parent company, iFinex Inc., which was founded in 2012 in Hong Kong and is registered in the British Virgin Islands.  Tether’s history goes back to 2014, when it first issued a dollar-backed digital currency called realcoin on the Bitcoin network to help transfer fiat currencies on the blockchain. Later that year, realcoin was rebranded tether. (Tether refers to the issuer company, while tether, or USDT, is the token.)  Since then, Tether has expanded to numerous blockchains, launched various tokens and skyrocketed in popularity. As of the end of May 2022, all the USDT tokens outstanding were worth $73 billion, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  How does Tether’s USDT work?  Tether’s cryptocurrencies belong to a special subset of digital assets called stablecoins, which means their prices are anchored, or pegged, to a less-volatile asset.  Stablecoins serve as an important link between the real world and cryptocurrencies. With their prices tied to a stable asset such as a central bank-issued (fiat) currency like the U.S. dollar, stablecoins promise to shield crypto holders from volatility and are well-suited for transactions and trades on and between blockchains.  Read more: What Is a Stablecoin?  Tether issues several fiat stablecoins and one that is pegged to gold. The most widespread among them is the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin USDT, with a circulating supply of about 73 billion tokens.  Other Tether-issued stablecoins are:  Tether gold (AUXT): pegged to gold’s price  Tether euro (EURT): pegged to the common currency of the European Union  Tether peso (MXNT) : pegged to the Mexican peso  Tether yuan (CNHT): pegged to the offshore Chinese yuan  Tether doesn’t have its own blockchain. Instead, users can transact with USDT on and across some of the bigger blockchain platforms including:  Ethereum  Tron  Algorand  Solana  Avalanche  Polygon  USDT is not mined and it is not decentralized. It has a central entity, the company Tether, that issues (mints) and destroys (burns) USDT tokens to adjust the supply of coins to user demand.  Read More: What Does It Mean to Burn Crypto?  What backs USDT’s value?  Tether claims its stablecoins' value is always 100% backed by assets in its reserve to ensure the one-to-one exchange ratio to the currency (or asset) to which their prices are anchored. Similar to how a casino has to have enough cash in its vault to cover every chip in play, the reserve serves as a guarantee that if everyone wanted to convert USDT into fiat, they could.  Tether publishes a quarterly attestation – which is not the same as an audit – breaking down its reserves by asset classes on its website, and updates total value of the assets every day.  According to its latest report, Tether’s reserve contains a diverse mix of:  cash  cash equivalents (money market funds, U.S. Treasury bills)  commercial paper  corporate bonds  loans  other investments including digital currencies  Why USDT’s backing is controversial  The transparency and authenticity of the reserve has been called into question from time to time in the crypto world.  Tether only started to publish reports on their assets in early 2021, but still does not specify exactly what assets it holds. The attestation is not verified by an independent auditor.  The most scrutiny has been on the non-cash holdings including what they are, how they are valued and how easily Tether can convert them into cash if stablecoin holders want to redeem their initial investment at once.  In 2019, New York Attorney General’s office (NYAG) launched a probe into whether the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex sought to cover up the loss of $850 million in customer and corporate funds held by Tether, the payment processor.  After almost two years, Tether and Bitfinex reached a settlement with NYAG in February 2021 to pay $18.5 million in fines and to release a quarterly report describing the reserve’s composition for the next two years. (Note: CoinDesk has joined a legal proceeding involving the NYAG, Tether and its parent company iFinex as part of the effort to shed light on the reserves backing the stablecoins.)  Read more: CoinDesk Joins Court Case Seeking Access to NYAG Tether Documents  How USDT is different from other stablecoins  Once Tether’s USDT dominated the stablecoin market, but now there is a wide selection of stablecoins available. Some of the ways they differ depends on the issuer entity, the collateral that backs the value and how they keep their prices pegged to the fiat currency or other asset. Tether follows the IOU (I owe you) model. This means that a central entity backs the value of stablecoin with assets, and the issuer promises that you can redeem your investment anytime at a one-to-one exchange rate.  USDT vs. algorithmic stablecoins  Algorithmic stablecoins such as Tron’s USDD or Waves's USDN keep the exchange rate with trading incentives and the automatic minting and burning of tokens with the help of a twin token to absorb volatility without an outside reserve asset. USDT does not operat that way because Tether, not an algorithm, decides when to burn or mint tokens according to demand.  USDT vs. DAI  DAI, the stablecoin of MakerDAO, is also backed by assets in a reserve but it is overcollateralized – meaning the reserve holds more assets in the reserve than DAI’s total value – and only holds cryptocurrencies such as ether and USDC. Additionally, MakerDAO does not have a central governing body – leadership is spread out among holders of the MakerDAO governance token – contrary to Tether’s centralized entity.  USDT vs. USDC  Both Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are backed by real assets and issued by a centralized entity, but the key difference between them is in the composition of reserves. USDC only holds cash and short-term U.S. government bonds, according to its monthly report. Thus USDC is perceived as a safer and more transparent asset.  How you can buy and hold USDT  The easiest way for the average investor to buy and sell Tether’s stablecoins is through a cryptocurrency exchange. USDT is widely used by traders and is available on most crypto exchanges.  Stablecoins are digital currencies, so you can hold your USDT on any type of crypto wallet, hot or cold.  Large crypto holders such as institutional investors and crypto exchanges can access USDT and other Tether-issued stablecoins directly from Tether. They can buy stablecoins by depositing cash and may redeem their investments by returning the virtual coins at the 1:1 exchange rate Tether promises.  Average investors may see USDT's price on crypto exchanges change every so often. For example, when one of the most notable stablecoins, Terra’s UST, collapsed in May 2022, other stablecoin prices wobbled on exchanges and USDT fell to as low as 97 cents for a brief period as people panicked and pulled their money out. More recently the price is up to a shade under $1.",NEUTRAL,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | USDT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-tether-how-usdt-works-and-what-backs-its-value,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/501b9efd67b58789b4d054b3f43f2efa9dc5f777-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42420964,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcX6l5B,1654116267,FTX’s Harrison Says Stablecoin Demand Will Survive Terra's Collapse,"Without a doubt, 2022 has put the crypto industry through a stress test. Bitcoin hit a low price not seen since 2020, the industry’s market cap dropped to $1.2 trillion from $3 trillion five months ago, and what was one of the most popular crypto assets, Terra's LUNA token, is now effectively worthless.  Many newbie investors might ask what all of that means. Is crypto really worth nothing, as European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said, or is now a buying opportunity?  According to Brett Harrison, head of FTX.US, it's a mix.  “So much capital has moved into the private equity space in crypto,” he told CoinDesk last week on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s annual summit in Davos, Switzerland. “There are a lot of teams that are building and creating new infrastructure, building out new projects, that we're probably going to see a lot of that investment come back over time.”  In a wide-ranging interview with CoinDesk, Harrison talked about the Terra and LUNA crash, if crypto exchanges should act as a gatekeeper for assets that don’t look promising and what competition can be expected from traditional exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange that may offer more than just bitcoin and ethereum in the future.  This interview has been edited for length and clarity.  CoinDesk: Do you think crypto traders are going to rely less on stablecoins? What would be the alternative for the crypto industry?  Harrison: No, I don't think we're going to see less demand for the use of stablecoins and crypto. This word stablecoin is used in a lot of different contexts to mean different things. The Terra stablecoin is not a stablecoin at all. It's like an auto rebalancing structured product backed by a volatile asset, and it's basically a subsidized peg. There's too much of a run on that asset if the asset is too volatile, so that was never really going to last forever. It's very different from USDC. Most of the underpinnings of DeFi (decentralized finance) and even for centralized finance come from these fiat-backed stablecoins, which I don't think are a risk at all compared to something like Terra.  You were saying that UST basically was never going to be able to be what it was intended to be. What is your role as an exchange as sort of a gatekeeper for projects like Terra and coins like LUNA where they're sort of unproven and thus carry lots of risks?  On traditional equity exchanges, on futures exchanges, on commodity exchanges and on crypto exchanges, you have assets of various degrees of volatility. What's important is the disclosure of risks that come with it. UST was a completely open crypto. The code for what was actually going on there was completely open source, everyone knew exactly how it worked. It was a subsidized peg. There was no lack of transparency there, and everyone understood there was risk in the asset itself. I mean, to be able to offer a 20% yield on a token, that sort of very high yield doesn't come without risks. It brings up an interesting question as an exchange, whether it is our job to protect investors from having any sort of risk or volatility. We screen out assets all the time that we think aren't legitimate or don't actually have transparency or are a long-term value in that way. It's a fine line for us to decide whether we want to cross or not, but the most important thing is disclosure, and it's why we think it's so important for there to be regulation around stablecoins to make sure that if someone wants to call themselves a stablecoin, it actually is a stablecoin and not this sort of risky asset.  Do you think that there's going to be a regulatory framework on what can be listed and what cannot be listed?  There are bills that have been proposed by Congress members that actually talk about, for example, what kinds of assets a stablecoin could hold to call itself a stablecoin. On the listing side, there are many jurisdictions that already have standards for what you can list. For example, even in New York state, the DFS (Department of Financial Services) has a green list of what assets you're allowed to list. We would love to see more clarity from the market regulators in the United States on being able to understand exactly what assets can be listed by an exchange.  Let's talk about markets a little bit. Do you think there is going to be competition between traditional exchanges and crypto exchanges in the near future?  It’s an interesting question. We've seen a number of traditional exchanges talk about getting into crypto-related projects or exchange offerings. I think it's very possible that traditional exchanges might want to get into crypto in that way. I also think the other way could be true as well. We launched a stocks offering on our platform, and we're not an exchange – we're a broker that's introducing stock trading to exchanges. But you know, we may very well in the future become a competitor to traditional exchanges, as well. We certainly are in the derivatives space.  Are you afraid of that competition in the future?  We're not afraid of the competition; we welcome the competition, but there certainly is competition, and we already see a lot of pushback from the incumbents in the space on our application to the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) to enable margin or clearinghouse. So there's definitely a lot of concern from our competitors that we're going to come in and disrupt the space, and that's exactly what we hope to do.  I want to talk a little bit about the correlation between the crypto market and the equities market. Do you see that correlation breaking anytime in the future and if so, what do you think could break it?  Right now, we're in a global environment where assets are going down. That's true across equities, bonds, broad-based futures of various kinds, crypto, and there's a lot of macroeconomic factors going into these down moves. There's also specific things to crypto, for example, in everything that happened with the Terra ecosystem. What we're finding now is, as crypto gains more mainstream adoption, that means that more institutions are allocating percentage of their portfolios of crypto, which means in a down move when they're looking for things to sell, crypto is going to be in the line of fire just like everything else. And so in a doubt, in a sort of violent downturn, all correlations go to one, everything is going down. And so right now, as prices are decreasing across the board, of course, there's going to be high correlation between these assets. As the market starts to turn around, I think we're going to see more growth, idiosyncratic moves between crypto and the traditional equity markets.  Do you see more institutional investors exiting or entering this phase right now during the current market sell off?  That's a good question. I think it's really going to be a mix. We're going to see some institutions that think this could be a perfect time to reenter the market at favorable prices. We're going to see some that feel that even though the sort of contagion of the Terra meltdown was sort of contained, they might see that as a reason to be more skeptical of crypto as a whole asset class and might cool off on investment, whether that's public or private investments. So we are going to see a mix for that over time, but in general, so much capital has moved into the private equity space in crypto. There's a lot of teams that are building and creating new infrastructure, building out new projects that we're probably going to see a lot of that investment come back over time.",NEUTRAL,LUNA,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/01/ftxs-harrison-says-stablecoin-demand-will-survive-terras-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4eff0c1c6bb68c072d3559863a1673c453593e92-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In digital asset mining, particularly for bitcoin, competition has increased greatly in recent years as several new entrants joined the industry during the peak of 2021. However, with a price decline, survival of many new miners might be hanging on these companies being able to sell themselves or merge with another peer, according to industry participants.  “I think in the next six months or so we'll probably see some M&A activity happen,” said Amanda Fabiano, head of mining at Galaxy Digital, “because some miners who got in the sector during the peak are just not going to be able to meet their requirements.”  Read more: How Does Bitcoin Mining Work?  During the 2021 bull run of the crypto market, margins of some bitcoin miners had been as high as 90%, which led to many new entrants and miners looking to grow at hyper speed. To do so, companies ordered mining rigs at high prices and deposited money upfront for their orders.  Fast forward to 2022, bitcoin prices have tumbled and margins have shrunk. Bitcoin network’s hashrate is hovering around all-time highs and operating costs are higher due to rise in energy prices – leaving miners in a very tight spot. “A falling bitcoin price means miner margins are compressing,” said Mason Jappa, co-founder and CEO of blockchain infrastructure and cryptocurrency mining company Blockware Solutions. “On top of that, margins have also been declining because Bitcoin’s network mining difficulty is increasing” as more miners are joining the network, he added.  Read more: The Future of Mining Finance: Time to Get Creative  A less profitable environment for bitcoin mining  Many of these companies that came into the mining sector in the last 12-18 months lacked a “sound balance sheet,” Mike Levitt, CEO of Core Scientific (CORZ), the largest publicly traded miner in terms of hashrate, told CoinDesk.  “These companies have found themselves in a position where they made plans and commitments that assumed external capital, whether from public or private markets, would always be readily available,"" he said. ""Now, the cost of capital, if available, just got more expensive, and some of these miners do not have sufficient capital to finish what they have started.”  Read more: 8 Trends That Will Shape Bitcoin Mining in 2022  Moreover, supply-chain issues and lack of access to capital are making matters worse for many miners. “The ability to secure large pre-orders of ASIC miners is no longer the major bottleneck to growth,” said Wall Street bank Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen in a recent research note. “Construction delays, caused by difficulties securing building materials and finalizing power purchase agreements, are a larger impediment to deploying new fleets.""  This perspective was echoed by crypto miner Hive Blockchain. “The crypto mining industry in general appears to find itself at a crossroads with a supply of very expensive ASIC chips and few places to plug them in,” according to a statement from the miner. “In our market intelligence, the company has noticed significant supply disruptions for electrical equipment needed to make data centers, such as transformers and switch gear.""  All these factors combined, and some of the newer and less capitalized miners are now in a limbo, as they are finding it hard to pay for their operations under the terms set out during the bull run.  “I think we're going to see miners get humbled this year, in contrast to last year, when we saw the rise of public miners,” Fabiano said. Some of the miners who have signed some longer-term contracts will have to put up a lot of money in order to satisfy those obligations, she added.  On top of that, the ASIC markets are shifting downward, which means that miners are not going to be able to make the profit that they could have on the secondary market by just selling their machines if their operations aren’t up and running, according to Fabiano. In fact, with the slide in bitcoin prices, some of the older mining rigs, such as Bitmain’s Antminer S9s, are becoming less profitable, leading to miners shutting them down to avoid shouldering the costs.  This is likely to drive several miners to look for an exit strategy by selling their business or merging with other companies. “I think the ones [miners] that have no operational experience, no background in bitcoin mining, are probably the ones that will look for M&A, or they’ll have a distressed debt situation where they're taking on [expensive] debt,” she said.  M&A opportunities  This tight market environment has already led to larger, more established miners, such as Core Scientific and Bitfarms (BITF), to lower their hashrate growth expectations for the year to a level that is more serviceable via capital they already have on their balance sheets. Meanwhile, Marathon Digital (MARA) remains “cautiously optimistic” about their hashrate growth outlook.  With larger miners reining in their growth outlook, the newer and smaller miners are likely to be in a tougher spot. This will probably lead to mergers fairly quickly given how long these newer entrants can actually withstand some of this market volatility in a bear market, according to Michael Ashe, head of investment banking at Galaxy Digital. “I think we're going to see all different shapes and forms of M&A opportunities,” in this cycle, he said.  In fact, Core Scientific has said that the company is already getting calls for M&A from miners who are feeling the squeeze. “There are a number of folks that have commitments that were dependent upon their being able to raise additional capital, and they're finding it challenging to raise that capital,” said Core’s Levitt during a conference call, adding, “we're starting already to have to be approached, frankly, with opportunities.”  Core Scientific will look at two types of potential M&A deals: One is cheap mining companies, and other is a business that helps the company grow, Levitt told CoinDesk. “Those are the two areas we're looking for. It's either value or growth, and if you're really lucky, it's a combination of both,” he said.  Moreover, he is also getting calls from other parts of the mining ecosystem, including companies with electrical equipment and power providers who now suddenly have a surplus of both and need buyers. ""Companies that did not prepare for this downturn have very difficult strategic decisions to make. In terms of consolidation, we appreciate the current complexities in this industry, and we will continue to look into acquiring the best in class of our industry as we are presented with those deals,” Levitt added.  Read more: Marathon’s Thiel Says Company Not for Sale, as M&A Chatter Picks Up Among Crypto Miners  Miners who are more capitalized and have a solid strategy will likely find such a market an opportunistic one to pick up assets or companies at cheaper valuations. “This cycle is an interesting opportunity from an M&A perspective, because you do have some of these more established miners who have already weathered the past bear markets and will now look at this as an opportunity to go out and acquire equipment and real estate at attractive values,” said Galaxy’s Ashe.  Who will survive?  With publicly traded mining equities down, on average, more than 50% this year, investors’ confidence in the sector might be shaken. However, this could be an opportune time for longer-term investors to bottom-fish for attractive value. “Timing the exact bottom is not easy, but many on-chain and market indicators point to now being a good time to accumulate both bitcoin and bitcoin mining rigs,” said Blockware Solution’s Jappa. So then, what should the investors look for in a miner to sort out the winners?  One answer is look at the past downturns. “The miners that have survived the bear markets in the past are still going to be the ones that survive this next round,” said Galaxy’s Fabiano. “Being extremely opportunistic over the next six months with ASICs [as their prices drop] while also having a really strong strategy for growth on the infrastructure side will be an amazing way for miners to really separate themselves from the masses.""  Miners who are prepared and have the latest generation equipment with locked-in power rates will be able to benefit from current market conditions, said Zach Bradford, CEO of bitcoin miner CleanSpark (CLSK). “This stage in the business cycle will reward miners that have consistently delivered value to their shareholders and the Bitcoin ecosystem,” he added.  Another crucial factor to consider is the miners that are already sitting on cash and are still able to access the capital markets to finance their growth. “As the BTC mining industry funds more of its growth with debt, we expect the profitability of miners to continue to diverge with the larger public miners widening their cost of capital advantage,” wrote Wall Street investment bank BTIG’s analyst Gregory Lewis in a recent research note.  Read more: Battered Bitcoin Miners Increasingly Turn to Debt Financing  Digging deeper, Jefferies' Petersen sees larger miners, such as Marathon Digital and Core Scientific, at a “relative advantage” compared to smaller miners when accessing debt financing. He also expects companies to start selling some of their mined bitcoins that they usually hold on their balance sheets in order to pay for operational expenses.  Recently, miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK) said during its first quarter conference call that it is raising debt and selling a portion of its mined bitcoin to cover some of its expenses. Meanwhile, Core Scientific said that it sold some of its mined bitcoins this year and will continue to do so.  Other miners such as Marathon also said they are considering selling some of their mined bitcoins, while peer Riot Blockchain (RIOT) has already started selling its mined digital assets.  Read more: Bitcoin Miners Are Selling Off Their BTC Holdings to Cope With Market Headwinds  Tying it all together, Arcane Research’s analyst Jaran Mellerud wrote in a recent report that “to gauge which miners are the best prepared to get through the bear market and even potentially capitalize on it by buying assets of distressed competitors, it's essential to look at two factors: each company's bitcoin production cost and the strength of their balance sheets.”  Based on the most recent information, Riot Blockchain has the lowest power prices among the top five miners by market cap, only paying $24 per megawatt per hour (2.4 cents per kilowatt per hour), Mellerud wrote. He also noted that power prices have likely increased for all mining companies in recent months.  “Overall, based solely on its low power cost and healthy balance sheet, Riot seems to currently be in the strongest position of the five biggest public miners by market cap,” Mellerud said.  The bottom line is that investors trying to pick winners in a down market should look for miners with traits that include proven operational track records, lower costs, and good treasury management strategies and hedging options.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Aoyon Ashraf,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/01/bear-market-could-see-some-crypto-miners-turning-to-ma-for-survival,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7610364f36193e99058c1b922c236ad8a57b01b-5220x3480.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency reached a low of around $29,880 during the New York trading day.  Most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) declined alongside BTC on Wednesday. For example, Solana's SOL token declined by 10% over the past 24 hours, compared with a 4% decline in BTC over the same period. GALA and ADA were down by 7% on Wednesday.

It appears that macroeconomic uncertainty has kept some buyers on the sidelines, which benefitted gold and other commodities so far this year.  During the final week of May, bitcoin and stocks experienced a brief relief bounce, which paused the broader downtrend in prices. Trading conditions have been choppy this year, but the overall theme remains risk-off.  In the crypto market, bitcoin declined by less than other tokens in the CoinDesk 20 list last month. That suggests a lower appetite for risk among crypto traders. Typically, bitcoin declines by less than altcoins in a down market because of its lower risk profile.  MATIC, SHIB, SOL and AVAX declined by more than 40% last month and are down by more than 60% year to date.  Lower seasonal strength  On average, over the past nine years, bitcoin has produced a positive return in June. Over the following three months, however, the odds of a strong return diminish.  Bitcoin's negative return in May was outside of its seasonal norm, which means current market conditions are different compared with the past nine years. For example, rising interest rates, high inflation and geopolitical risks have weighed on all speculative assets this year.

42415438,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrM9,1654114268,Optimism's OP Token Plummets After Botched Airdrop,"Ethereum scaling project Optimism’s new OP token is down over 70% after launching via a community airdrop on Tuesday.  According to data from CoinMarketCap, the price of the token has plummeted to $1.20 from $4.50, as many airdrop recipients immediately sold the freshly claimed tokens.  Assuming a total supply of 4.3 billion OP tokens, the latest trading price would imply a fully diluted market capitalization of $5.1 billion. But such calculations can be tricky, because less than 5% of the total supply is actually in the hands of investors who can trade them.  The much-anticipated airdrop was met with widespread frustration from the Optimism community, as panicked users complained that some claimants were able to claim their tokens ahead of the official airdrop launch.  Optimism officially tweeted about the launch at 5:45 p.m. ET, hours after the smart contract was already deployed and the token began trading on both decentralized and centralized exchanges.  “At 11am (EST) we deployed and loaded our [smart contract] with the OP tokens for Drop #1,” Optimism tweeted in the wake of the airdrop. “Our biggest mistake here was failing to make this contract pausable. Claims were open, and we had no way to stop them.”  Later on, the increased activity on Optimism led to transaction delays, leading to more frustration from the community and further delaying the official airdrop announcement.  “We significantly underestimated the amount of expected load [deploying our claims user interface] would have on our public RPC endpoint,” Optimism said in a tweet, referring to remote procedure call. “We quickly moved to massively expand the resources available to serve our public RPC, a process which took several hours of coordination (and waiting) for the amount of load we observed.”  The Optimism team added that there were “a lot of lessons” learned from the botched airdrop and they would be “publishing an extensive retrospective next week.”  According to data from Dune Analytics, just over 43% of eligible wallet addresses had claimed their share of the airdrop as of press time.  Token governance  In response to the OP token dumping, an Optimism community member, 0xJohn, submitted a governance proposal that would ban sellers of the initial airdrop from receiving future Optimism airdrops.  “These accounts are not playing a constructive role in Optimism governance,” 0xJohn wrote. “Instead of contributing to governance, they are maximizing for profit.”  Some community members voiced disagreement.  “People can do what they want with their airdrops,” Optimism user Mohammedt75 wrote. “Only those actually interested in governance should actually be involved in governance.”",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | OP | AIRDROP,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/01/optimisms-op-token-plummets-after-botched-airdrop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36581c41abd755c8ffa84d1b54058821ca44d404-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The filing comes just months after West announced his disinterest in NFT projects in a handwritten letter posted to his Instagram on Feb. 1, a post he has since deleted, that clarified that the rapper’s focus was on “building real products in the real world.”  West’s post came on the heels of a viral interview featuring Paris Hilton and Jimmy Fallon talking about their Bored Ape NFTs and several other celebrity NFT endorsements. While West seemed adamant in his letter that he would not be jumping into the NFT space anytime soon, he did suggest that he might eventually have a change of heart, ending the missive by asking fans to “ask me later.”  As celebrity NFT projects and endorsements become increasingly popular, trademark filings have become a common way for the rich and famous to get their feet wet and make an initial claim.  In April, soccer great David Beckham submitted three metaverse and NFT-related trademark applications while, in March, Notorious B.I.G., LLC, which manages Biggie Smalls’ intellectual property, filed three trademarks that indicated the company’s likely plans to release NFTs of the late rapper. And in February, YouTube star, professional boxer and NFT fan Logan Paul helped kick-start the trend of celebrities launching their brands in Web 3 by filing several NFT and metaverse trademarks.

42374446,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvZVsL,1654110152,Inside Madison Cawthorn's $150K Crypto Bet: Here's the Wallet Under Ethics Investigation,"Most of the 90-odd guests at Donald Trump’s glitzy Christmas party in Naples, Fla., last December left with the ultimate GOP keepsake: a photo of themselves beside a smiling, thumbs-upping former POTUS.  But for Rep. Madison Cawthorn, the Republican firebrand from North Carolina, the night’s biggest souvenir was perhaps a crypto investment: the “Let’s Go Brandon” meme coin. (“Let’s Go Brandon” is Trump world shorthand for “f*** Joe Biden.”)  Crypto’s libertarian flair and the LGB project’s reputed donations to veterans’ groups intrigued the congressman, according to James Koutoulas, a hedge fund manager and key LGB backer who said he told Cawthorn about the coin at Trump’s party in Naples.  “He gave me a check a couple of weeks” later, after liquidating some assets, Koutoulas told CoinDesk in a phone call. The check was for about $150,000, Koutoulas said.  CoinDesk identified Cawthorn’s Ethereum network wallet by cross-referencing the public disclosures with on-chain data and confirming the matches with people familiar with the trades. The public, transparent transaction history indicates that all told, Cawthorn likely lost money on his crypto trades despite early wins.  The wallet received 180 billion LGB tokens, which were worth around $160,000 at the time, from Koutoulas’ wallet in a single transaction. “He locked in price earlier,” Koutoulas wrote in a text message, addressing the apparent $10,000 discrepancy.  The transfer went through on Dec. 21.  Cawthorn later predicted LGB’s price would the next day “go to the moon” in a Dec. 29 Instagram comment. When the LGB team announced a sponsorship of NASCAR driver Brandon Brown on Dec. 30, the coin indeed rallied mightily. The next day, Cawthorn sold off roughly a third of his LGB for a considerably more liquid cryptocurrency, ether (ETH), fetching a 94% return in dollar terms (though it’s unclear if he moved that ETH to cash).  It was a sequence of events that would come to haunt the first-term congressman. Six months later – after a sea of scandals sunk his reelection bid – Cawthorn’s LGB trades are under investigation by the U.S. House Committee on Ethics.  Read more: Madison Cawthorn Hit With US House Ethics Investigation Over Crypto Promotion  Spurred by allegations of insider trading and a “pump and dump” scheme, investigators are examining whether Cawthorn “improperly promoted” LGB without disclosing his investment in it. (They’re also looking into an alleged “improper relationship” with a staffer.)  Cawthorn formally disclosed his LGB trades on May 27, four days after the House launched its ethics investigation. Short on details, his disclosure nonetheless paints a picture of a savvy trader who cashed out a six-figure profit at just the right time. (LGB peaked on Dec. 31 and is now essentially worthless.)  “I got Let’s Go Brandon coin,” Cawthorn barked in a Feb. 27 Instagram video posted to Koutoulas’ account. “It’s working out very well – very well!”  On closer inspection, however, Cawthorn’s LGB trades don't appear to have worked out “very well” at all. He’s at best close to even; at worst, he’s down bad from a mix of taxable capital gains and the bear market slump.  Cawthorn’s team didn't respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson told a local paper on Wednesday that the lawmaker is being “falsely accused by partisan adversaries for political gain.”  CoinDesk’s editorial policy gives great weight to the crypto-community value of privacy and therefore requires an overwhelming public interest before revealing the individuals behind pseudonymous blockchain addresses or internet handles. In this case, there is clearly such an interest, given Cawthorn’s position as an elected official and the allegations under investigation.  Cawthorn’s transaction history (Eastern time)  Dec. 21, 2021  Cawthorn receives 180 billion LGB tokens from Koutoulas for around $150,000. LGB’s price is “materially the same” as it had been at the time of their handshake deal three weeks prior, according to Koutoulas.  Dec. 29, 2021  “Tomorrow we go to the moon!” Cawthorn predicts in an Instagram comment directed at “LGB legends.” He’s pictured smiling with Koutoulas and another man – both of whom are wearing LGB buttons.  Dec. 30-31, 2021  LGB surges 70% in 48 hours, hitting all-time highs after Brown, the NASCAR driver, announces he will paint his car with LGB coin regalia for the upcoming race season.  Dec. 31, 2021  Cawthorn’s wallet trades 65.8 billion LGB tokens for around 28 ETH (then worth $105,000) in a series of transactions routed through the decentralized exchange Uniswap.  Considering that he paid $55,000 for this chunk of LGB, he notches 93% returns on this portion of his investment.  Cawthorn’s wallet sends 26.3 ETH to the Coinbase exchange via an intermediary wallet.  Jan. 4, 2022  NASCAR nixes Brown’s LGB paint scheme, sending the token tumbling. It is down nearly 45% from its Dec. 31 highs.  Cawthorn’s wallet trades 34.8 billion LGB tokens for about 8.65 ETH (then worth around $33,420) through Uniswap. He notches a 14.6% return on this trade, based on the roughly $29,141 purchase price for this batch of LGB.  Jan. 17, 2022  LGB coin has fallen 64% from all-time highs and is well below Cawthorn’s Dec. 21 purchase price.  Cawthorn’s wallet trades 62.2 billion LGB for 8.70 ETH ($27,998) on Uniswap. He takes a 46% loss on this final trade involving LGB, having paid about $51,970 for this portion of the initial investment.  Jan. 25, 2022  Cawthorn’s wallet sends around 10 ETH (around $24,500) to Coinbase via an intermediary wallet. ETH has tumbled 35% from its price on Jan. 4, when Cawthorn acquired 8.6 ETH then worth over $32,000.  Jan. 29, 2022  Cawthorn’s wallet sends 8 ETH (then around $20,824) to Coinbase via an intermediary wallet. ETH is down 17% from its Jan. 17 price, when Cawthorn made his final LGB trade.  At this point, Cawthorn has sent just about $142,000 in ETH to Coinbase in three batches, possibly for cash out, because the exchange is where traders convert crypto to dollars. But it’s impossible to know for sure. While his congressional disclosures detail an ETH buy on Dec. 31, they never mention a sale. Then again, they fail to disclose any activity after Dec. 31, anyhow, despite a 2012 law requiring congressmen to disclose their investments within 45 days of a trade.  Cawthorn’s wallet history documents a series of LGB trades that he still hasn't disclosed even well after the law’s deadline. That said, it’s impossible to say precisely who controlled the wallet without hearing from Cawthorn himself.  That law, known as the STOCK Act, also prohibits officials from trading on insider information. Cawthorn’s colleagues have accused him of insider trading and pointed to his LGB promotion on the eve of the NASCAR deal.  Koutoulas said he is skeptical of the allegations. “These people are saying that an Instagram [post] equals insider trading,” the hedge fund manager said. He denied that Cawthorn knew about the NASCAR sponsorship when he agreed to buy LGB in early December. He further said Cawthorn’s “to the moon” comment Dec. 29 came after Brown, the driver, had himself teased the LGB announcement.  Read more: US Charges Ex-OpenSea Exec With NFT Insider Trading  Regardless, Cawthorn, who sold LGB for ETH (which itself was crashing through January) likely lost money on his $150,000 initial investment; he almost certainly ran up a hefty short-term capital gains tax bill for the 2021 trades. Based on his congressional salary for last year ($174,000), his married status and his $50,000 gain from the Dec. 31 trades, Cawthorn’s New Year’s Eve swaps fall into a 24% tax bracket, experts said.  His 2022 trades from LGB to ETH mix modest gains with heavy losses – at best he came out close to even. It’s impossible to know for sure without seeing his Coinbase trading history. LGB has since fallen to virtually zero, wiping out the remainder of his position.  Other trades from the same wallet included sub-$1,000 trades for metaverse tokens Decentraland (MANA), The Sandbox (SAND) and Polka City (POLC), plus the NFT (non-fungible token) mortgage project Vera (VRA). His wallet still holds about 0.41 ETH.  Capitol Hill insiders were flummoxed when told how Cawthorn’s LGB trades were executed. Most lawmakers put their assets in a blind trust, one former Hill staffer said. Although that’s not always the case, that former staffer noted Cawthorn’s history of going against the grain.",NEUTRAL,ETH | MANA,ETH | EXCHANGE | MANA | REGULATION | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/01/cawthorns-crypto-wallet-reveals-undisclosed-trades-amid-house-ethics-investigation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dfc635b1f38f9d787c9a4a1b3c3fe569538c9ae3-3960x2640.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Market Sentiment Remains In Extreme Fear Territory As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the crypto fear and greed index has continued to point at extreme fear this week. The &apos;fear and greed index&apos; is an indicator that measures the general market sentiment among Bitcoin and crypto investors. The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from one to hundred for representing this sentiment. All values above &apos;50&apos; signify greed in the market, while those below the threshold suggest fear among investors. The extreme values of above 75 and below 25 imply sentiments of &apos;extreme fear&apos; and &apos;extreme greed,&apos; respectively. Historically, bottoms in the price of Bitcoin have tended to form during periods of extreme fear. On the other hand, the crypto has observed tops during stretches of extreme greed. Some investors think that because of this, it&apos;s best to buy during extreme fear, while extreme greed is ideal for selling.

35551,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=238170,1654108258,How Brands and Influencers can Incentivize themselves with Social Tokens,"The emergence of social tokens to incentivize one&apos;s services on social blockchain platforms is notable. The concept is foreign to many brands and influencers, but there is interest in understanding how they work. It begs the question: What are social tokens, and how do they work? First, it is important to understand that influencers today depend on social media firms to pay them to popularize other brands to their fanbase. However, the influencers do not receive the value they deserve since the third-party firms get a share of the spoils. The best social tokens to invest in will eliminate the need to receive marketing incentives from such entities by ensuring direct engagement. Here is how they work: Content Creators Receive Incentives Directly from Consumers Creating a social token ensures direct interaction between a creator&apos;s work and brand with the people who consume the work. The blockchain-based tokens return power to the creative and influencers by allowing them to reap the rewards directly from the fans. The influencer owns a limited supply of tokens that he gives to the fans as appreciation for their support.

42421160,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXasEn,1654105512,"Undercollateralized USDN Stablecoin Needs Tweaking, Waves Founder Says","The algorithm powering the Waves protocol’s neutrino USD (USDN) stablecoin needs to be adjusted in the wake of two recent depeggings from the U.S. dollar, founder Sasha Ivanov said Wednesday.  “We have to work on the algorithm,” Ivanov said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program. “And what happens now is kind of inevitable, which is just a test of the whole system.”  USDN is dollar-based stablecoin backed by the protocol’s waves tokens, which are locked in smart contracts to mint USDN. USDN redemptions have the opposite effect, destroying the stablecoin to unlock the waves token supply. The idea is to keep USDN’s price steady at $1 per token. The risk is that there may not be enough collateral to back redemptions during a crisis, which is what happened to Terra’s UST stablecoin and luna token last month,  In April, USDN lost its $1 peg and fell to 83 cents, while the WAVES token that backs the stablecoin fell to $22 from $50 within days amid a price manipulation scare. That depegging wiped out nearly $200 million in USDN’s market capitalization. In May, USDN once again fell when UST’s collapse rippled through the stablecoin world, this time bringing USDN's price to 88 cents.  Ivanov said that “some people made a lot of money with waves crashing.”  Ivanov was asked how Waves was different from Terra, whose UST algorithmic stablecoin and luna token crashed in May, wiping out $60 billion in market value. Neutrino’s protocol has “similar mechanics” to Terra, “but (is) different,” he said, citing restrictions on how many redemptions users can get in one day.  Both projects were inspired by the Basis protocol, an algorithmic stablecoin that was ultimately shut down because of its potential use as a security, he added. (Luna founder Do Kwon appears to have tried to revive Basis at one point under a pseudonym before starting Terra, as reported by CoinDesk).  Read more: Algorithmic Stablecoins: What They Are and How They Can Go Terribly Wrong  Ivanov said a group of developers are making adjustments to USDN but emphasized that nothing at the moment has been changed. One change that is needed, he said, would be to “create an incentive for people to recapitalize USDN because guarantee incentives are not sufficient.”  Ivanov said USDN doesn’t have sufficient backing, and likened it to fractional reserve banking in traditional markets, saying that “​​banks have been working with fractional reserve setup for centuries and they're doing fine.”  Nonetheless, he said that “it's better to be fully backed and have over-capitalization.""  USDN was recently trading at a 1% discount to the U.S. dollar.  “This is the beginning of the process, and I think it will result in the emergence of a very stable, stablecoin,” Ivanov said.  As part of the process, Waves has released a master DeFi Revival Plan to restore user confidence and protocol functionality.  “We have developers that are trying to make the stablecoin very stable,” Ivanov said. “It’s a very natural process, and we will be better off once we have come out with some better algorithms.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | TRADING,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/01/undercollateralized-usdn-stablecoin-needs-tweaking-waves-founder-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47aaa4437a843079056b1dd92284db1a02fd9bd6-1910x1110.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A contract is a legal document that contains sets of promises agreed upon by the parties. They show the validity of a transaction. Smart contracts are, therefore, the digital format of these transactions that act as a basis on which parties fulfill their contractual obligations. Smart contacts ensure that the parties are paid immediately after performing their duties. Smart contracts are complex and inherently unique and thus do not fit into traditional orthodox contract law paradigms. There is no legislation or provisions that cater to some of the elements that pop up from these forms of contracts. Many states do not currently have any laws that govern the application of smart contracts or their validity.

42415446,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrfS,1654104503,Bitcoin Miners Are Selling Off Their BTC Holdings to Cope With Market Headwinds,"Bitcoin miners are selling off their mined tokens as the tumbling price of bitcoin erases profit margins at the same time capital markets are becoming less friendly.  Miner flows to exchanges have reached their highest point since January, Compass Mining – a bitcoin mining services company – wrote in a research note today using data from CoinMetrics. ""Miners may begin to sell hodl'd Bitcoin into the open market,"" wrote Compass. ""At the very least they are feeling the pain after the last major dip in price. Couple this with a downwards difficulty adjustment – indicating miners powering off – and it seems miners may be hitting a wall in profitability.""  Mining bitcoin (BTC) has become less profitable as the price of the crypto has trended downwards, with popular machines like Bitmain's Antminer S9 becoming money losers at electricity prices of six cents per kilowatt hour. Struggling miners who would prefer not to shut down their rigs can look to raise capital in the debt or equity markets and/or sell off bitcoin holdings.  Argo Blockchain (ARBK) plans to raise debt and sell some of its bitcoin to cover expenses, the company said in an analyst call for its first quarter results. Core Scientific (CORZ), the world's largest miner by hashrate, has already sold some of its mined bitcoin this year and plans to continue doing so. Previously a confirmed HODLer, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) sold nearly half of its mined bitcoin in April after having also sold a sizable amount in March.  Cathedra Bitcoin in a May 30 statement said it sold 235 bitcoins during the month in a move to raise liquidity and ""insulate"" itself from further price declines. The company also had a tough April, operating at 45% of expected hashrate throughout the month thanks to storms affecting its North Dakota site.  There's also Marathon Digital (MARA), which – at its earnings call in early May – suggested it may sell some of its bitcoin.  The most recent note comes from Toronto-based Digihost, which today said it sold off a portion of its mined bitcoin to help fund energy costs.

42415437,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrK0,1654103791,US Charges Ex-OpenSea Exec With NFT Insider Trading,"Nate Chastain, the OpenSea staffer who quit the NFT marketplace after an insider trading scandal in September 2021, is now in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities.  Chastain was charged Wednesday with wire fraud and money laundering in connection with trading on confidential information about which non-fungible tokens were about to be featured on the OpenSea homepage, the Department of Justice said in a press release. The two charges each carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  The Justice Department alleged in the release that Chastain flipped ""dozens of NFTs"" after choosing to feature them on the website, selling them for two to five times what he initially paid. Chastain hid his fraud by making these purchases using anonymous digital currency wallets and anonymous OpenSea user accounts, according to the Justice Department.  ""NFTs might be new, but this type of criminal scheme is not,"" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. ""As alleged, Nathaniel Chastain betrayed OpenSea by using its confidential business information to make money for himself. Today's charges demonstrate the commitment of this office to stamping out insider trading – whether it occurs on the stock market or the blockchain.""  For its part, OpenSea said it quickly moved to investigate Chastain once it found out about his actions, and then asked him to resign.  ""When we learned of Nate's behavior, we initiated an investigation and ultimately asked him to leave the company,"" an OpenSea spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""His behavior was in violation of our employee policies and in direct conflict with our core values and principles.""  Chastain, 31, is working on a new NFT project, Oval, as CoinDesk reported in March based on investor materials. The Justice Department said Chastain was arrested this morning in New York.  Read more: OpenSea Exec Who Quit After ‘Insider Trading’ Scandal Is Back With NFT Platform  More NFT-related actions likely coming  Attorneys believe Chastain's arrest signals the onset of a new wave of enforcement actions related to NFTs.

""We know that there is a lot of insider trading in the industry, in NFTs"" and in decentralized finance (DeFi), Dilendorf told CoinDesk. ""So the question [for projects and project promoters] is, are you really disclosing all of the information to the users or the community?""  ""A lot of projects and a lot of market participants are walking down the edge of a knife,"" Dilendorf added. ""They get pulled in for an audit, or get subpoenaed by any of the federal regulators. I mean, it's so easy for regulators to build a money-laundering case, and it's so hard to defend against one.""  While a coming regulatory crackdown could spook the industry, Moish Peltz, a New York-based NFT lawyer, told CoinDesk that consumer confidence in NFT marketplaces could improve with stricter regulation.  ""If consumers are going to have confidence in the NFT marketplace, it is important for them to know they are not being taken advantage of by insiders using confidential information to their disadvantage,"" Peltz said in an email to CoinDesk.  ""It may be difficult for consumers to have that confidence given the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions. The U.S. government has proven again that they are extremely sophisticated in terms of building legal cases surrounding blockchain transactions,"" Peltz added.  In addition, Peltz noted that ""the legal guardrails applicable to the NFT marketplace are still emerging, and [the Chastain case] appears to be an important test case where the government is sending a message to insiders who may seek to misuse confidential information. It is now clear that the U.S. government is not ignoring NFT marketplaces. Insiders should act accordingly,"" he said.  UPDATE (June 1, 17:37 UTC): Updated with additional information throughout.

It has now recovered above a highly coveted point, returning some faith back into the market. However, the position where the digital asset currently resides is one that is unstable. Even though it seems to have found its footing above the $31,000 level, there is still the question of what this recovery actually means in the short term. Fakeout Or Breakout? It is important to note that the price of bitcoin had trended for a long time between $29,000 and $30,500. It spent quite some time here as the cryptocurrency had consolidated for the longest time.

42421550,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoccH,1654102720,How to Make Money From the Crypto Backlash,"In the wake of a more than 50% price drawdown in major cryptocurrencies and the collapse of some huge financial experiments, public sentiment on crypto has done a predictable 180 degree turn. It happens every few years: A crypto price bubble draws in a new wave of speculators, many of them get burned after making bad bets on technology they don’t fully understand and sentiment swings hard the other way. We’ve gone from the era of Davey Day Trader doing cute things with dogecoin to surgeons in Massachusetts losing their life savings on luna.  True, blue chip tech stocks like Meta and Netflix have lost nearly as much as BTC in dollar terms over the last year, but we’ll set that to the side. The crypto backlash is here, and it’s taking extremely familiar forms. Jackson Palmer, who initially created dogecoin as a performance-art critique of crypto, is making a new round of skeptical declarations. Molly White, founder of the anti-crypto blog Web3 is going just great, is getting profiled in the Washington Post. The skeptical “Crypto Critic’s Corner” is suddenly one of the top technology podcasts in the world.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  And good for all of those largely constructive and incisive critics. Having a healthy presence of informed critical voices is a plus, not a minus, for any serious emerging tech sector. But the broader backlash is going to produce much more worrisome nonsense, including its own set of evasions and misrepresentations.  Chelsea Manning provided a sterling example in an interview published Tuesday in which she did an awkward crabwalk around the word “cryptocurrency” when describing her work for a project called Nym. Manning described herself as a “crypto skeptic,” and attempted to explain how her project that uses a blockchain to supposedly preserve privacy isn’t part of that industry. But Nym has a token … which incentivizes network maintainers … and, look folks, it’s a cryptocurrency! Chelsea Manning is helping start a cryptocurrency and that’s actually fine!  Manning is a champion of privacy and democracy, a person we should all look up to for a few reasons, and it’s heartbreaking she feels the need to do this crypto-skeptic Kabuki while taking checks from a crypto startup. The idea behind the Nym project also seems … debatable. If you’re trying to protect citizens from government surveillance, a blockchain is maybe not the place to start. Sorry.  Getting crypto-shamed by a renowned privacy advocate pitching an iffy token project? That’s the very definition of “down bad.” And the wave of smug skeptics is not going to slow anytime soon, partly because this crash has clearly found its villain and fall guy in the form of Do Kwon, whose $68 billion luna/terraUSD stablecoin pair imploded in early April like a pair of retracting testicles. I say both villain and fall guy because he’ll be remembered not because he triggered the broader market crash (He maybe kind of did.) but because he and his work embodied all the worst excesses of the various screwups, improvisers, hypebeasts and charlatans who made the crash possible.  See also: Crypto Hype Cycles and You | Opinion  In previous years, that dunk-tanker might have been Mark Karpeles of Mt. Gox or Gerald Cotten of QuadrigaCX, but this time, after crypto reached levels of public exposure it has never seen before, it’s Do Kwon. He’s going to be all over TV for months. Having such a living embodiment of egotism, venality, recklessness and stupidity standing in for “crypto” as a whole is going to make things measurably worse for the industry. (And you should absolutely be mad at him about this, in addition to everything else.)  It’s going to be a rough stretch, and nobody actually knows how rough or for how long. Many of us have seen this show before. While there are variations, the crypto retrace cycle has repeated four or five times now. Each time, the same behaviors crop up as crypto goes from mania-of-the-month to whipping boy. The good news is, the retreating tide also presents opportunities.  ‘Blockchain, not crypto’: bear-market cringe  But the thing is, people will continue to enjoy taking investor money. Considering signals like Andreessen Horowitz’s new $4.5 billion crypto investing fund, a decent amount of capital may still be on offer even with public sentiment of crypto in the toilet. So you’ll hear a lot of squirming and doublespeak like Manning’s as people who still want that sweet, sweet crypto cash try to downplay their actual crypto activities.  Manning’s evasion is a close cousin of the all-time great in this category, the argument for “blockchain, not crypto.” This is a meaningless concept because tokens with economic value are fundamental to the design of distributed public blockchains, at least for the moment. But rhetorically, “blockchain, not crypto” is meant to signal that one wants all the cool parts of blockchain tech without the financial volatility.  “Blockchain, not crypto” has in previous downturns been a particularly attractive line for blockchain units within large corporations. Not coincidentally, one way of actually executing on the hollow premise of “enterprise blockchain” is with tightly controlled private networks, which may have some limited long-term promise but nothing remotely resembling the weird transformative implications of public blockchains. It’s a rhetorical feint, meant to trick people who sway with the breeze of shifting sentiment and don’t actually understand crypto at all.  Living in winter  Simply ignoring these craven contortionists is step one of thriving during a crypto winter. Another good move is to try and understand what happened. Why did Terra collapse? Why is SOL down 80% but ETH only 58%? There are actual reasons, and if you learn them now you’ll be better prepared when sentiment around crypto shifts the other direction and the next wave of impulsive swing-buyers arrives.  Another simple to-do thing but one you might not want to hear, is “stop day trading.” There is still downside out there, and no one knows where the market will bottom out. Secure whatever capital you’ve got left and shift focus elsewhere – specifically, to participating in communities, actively using products, developing skills and maybe even building something. Day trading is a sucker’s game even in boom times, but during bear markets it’s truly something to leave to the professionals. Calling yourself a “degen” on Twitter is less fun when your formerly hilarious gambling addiction has left you actually destitute.  See also: A Dictionary for Degens | Opinion  Spending this time learning is a path towards not just minimal self-respect (also, consider showering more) but actual success. Even a level 1 crypto speculator is learning a lot about the space, and at this point in the industry’s growth that knowledge will have value even during a crypto contraction. Prominent people in the industry will become a lot more accessible in the coming months as well, so you can really lay some groundwork for a future career move.  But the most important tip for surviving the crypto backlash is very simple: stick around. The sharply cyclical nature of crypto is its biggest annoyance and opportunity because it provides new entry points for the committed while regularly washing out the dilettantes. Whether you’re a new hire at a crypto company wondering if it’s time to ask Goldman Sachs for your job back or an ambitious newcomer hoping for a break, the biggest mistake you can make is taking your eye off the ball.

On May 7, the price of the then-$18-billion algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which is supposed to maintain a $1 peg, started to wobble and fell to 35 cents on May 9. Its companion token, LUNA, which was meant to stabilize UST's price, fell from $80 to a few cents by May 12.  CoinDesk followed and reported on the rise and the ultimate demise of the Terra ecosystem.

42421152,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXas7Z,1654096355,‘This Is the Usual’: Thai Central Bank Governor on CBDC Pilot Delay,"DAVOS, Switzerland — Thailand has been working on a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC), with an initial pilot planned for the second quarter of 2022, but the pilot was postponed to the fourth quarter of this year.  The pilot, or trial of the retail CBDC, which is designed for use by consumers, is expected to test deposits, withdrawals and transfers. A central bank official said last August that the retail CBDC will be tested as an alternative payment method for “cashlike activities within a limited scale.”  Earlier this year, Thailand also revealed plans to regulate crypto as a payment method, announcing in March that it will ban the use of crypto in payments.  CoinDesk spoke to the governor of Thailand’s central bank, Sethaput Suthiwartnarueput, about the bank’s plans for a retail CBDC and why the pilot was delayed following a panel, titled “Central Bank Digital Currencies,” last week at the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.  The following has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  CoinDesk: Thailand’s CBDC pilot was planned for the second quarter of 2022, but it has been delayed. What’s the latest on the project?  Suthiwartnarueput: It was just moved back a bit. This is the usual when trying to get alignment. We did a lot more consultation with stakeholders to make sure that we got the design right for the pilot. So yeah, that would be in the fourth quarter of this year if we could get it out. It will probably go on for about six months. But it's a limited scale pilot. We just want to make sure that we do it end to end, get the types of players that we want involved, both banks and nonbanks. We see question marks on how soon a retail CBDC might go production scale. But when that happens, it will warrant infrastructure, rather than a product because central banks aren’t good at coming up with products that can resonate with customers. And so we see it as putting in place the infrastructure that the private sector can innovate on, making sure that whatever platform they innovate on is controllable. I think it was the central bank governor of France who mentioned that the private sector is much better at the innovation side, that they're much better at the consumer-facing side than central banks. I think that ultimately, a retail CBDC will coexist with other stuff. Yes, it will probably replace cash. But not the other stuff that's still out there, including private stuff. That's kind of how we see it. The reason I went there and mentioned nonbanks was because we think we need to have new players involved in the space and as part of this pilot.  When central banks start exploring retail CBDCs they suddenly realize there are a lot of aspects to think about, but we don't really hear too much detail on some of these challenges that they have faced. It’s usually vague terms like “design” or “underlying technology” but what does that really mean for consumers?  Again, it gets back to that point that was raised during the panel that we want to be clear about what problem we're trying to solve and think about the benefits of it. The existing system works pretty well on payments, if we have a fast payment system [that] works very well. So the additional incremental benefits you would get from using a retail CBDC for payments are not immediately known. So it's important again, to get it right, rather than get it out quickly. But if you asked me whether we are still pursuing it, exploring it and making sure that we're ready, the short answer is yes. Why? Because even though fast payment systems can offer us a lot of low-hanging fruit that we can take advantage of, we recognize that there are limitations from an innovation standpoint. CBDCs and retail CBDCs offer more potential for the private sector to get involved, innovate. You can't put programmability on a fast payment system. It wouldn't work. There are a lot of possible questions both in terms of benefits, making sure that the risks can be addressed, and exploring unintended consequences. A retail CBDC is not insignificant, so that's why we're proceeding steadily.  In terms of the private sector building on a retail CBDC, what does it mean for Thailand?

A working paper authored by Auer titled ""Embedded supervision: How to build regulation into decentralized finance,"" published Wednesday, argues the compliance of DeFi players can be automatically monitored by ""reading the market's ledger.""  ""This reduces the need for firms to actively collect, verify and deliver data,"" the paper said.  DeFi is a term used to describe a range of intermediary-free financial applications built on a blockchain. The applications are built on distributed ledgers used to record transactions and for verification purposes. Although it is often championed by the crypto world and Web 3 enthusiasts, DeFi has left regulators around the world sounding an alarm over the urgent need to supervise the space.  But aside from a 2021 quarterly review by the BIS, an umbrella group for central banks, that called ""decentralization"" in DeFi an ""illusion,"" and argued that centralized points within DeFi could allow regulators ways into establishing control over the space, little practical headway has been made in establishing oversight.  The technology of embedded supervision, however, has attracted interest from policymakers. At the request of lawmakers, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union responsible for proposing new legislation, is currently preparing to charter a study on the potential impact of linking supervisory data applications to decentralized finance, as a precursor to potential further legislation.  But some have expressed skepticism about whether it is even possible to carry out such supervision on smart contracts where the code is unchangeable. Embedded supervision is ""both nice to have and unworkable in practice,"" George Giaglis, professor at the University of Nicosia Department of Digital Innovation, told CoinDesk.  ""You cannot enforce this at the protocol level. Unless you did something totally stupid like, you know, embedding code in smart contracts that would allow regulators to peer into transactions or something like that, which are things that cannot happen in practice,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,"Sandali Handagama, Jack Schickler",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/06/01/defi-ledgers-can-help-regulators-oversee-sector-bis-official-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/10c32064db333aa2b816bc94a5b8a6d26deffd61-2126x1418.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

TerraClassicUSD (USTC) is presently trading at $0.035 with a 24 hours increase of 21.2% while Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) is traded at $0.000117 within 24 hours decline of 26%. With the launch of Terra 2.0 which is the present LUNA in the market, there are diverse sentiments on its future. Some of the reasons why Luna 2.0 (LUNA) will succeed irrespective of the past history of Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) are: Correction of the congestion challenge. TerraLunaClassic (LUNC) past history. The rebranding. The investigation that the implosion was not an attack. Terra 2.0 (LUNA) recent run. Top cryptocurrency exchange listing of LUNA. Investors sentiments. Correction of the congestion challenge One of the reasons why the market implosion of Terra Luna Classic (LUNC), TerraClassicUSD (USTC), Anchor Protocol (ANC), and Mirror Protocol (MIR) was heavy was that top cryptocurrency exchanges that had them listed, suspended withdrawal and deposits on them.

42415450,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrlt,1654089786,"First Mover Americas: BTC Starts June Trading Flat, Alts Decline","Good morning, and welcome to First Mover. I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin trades flat and altcoins underperform.  Market Moves: BTC futures now account for 63% of the open interest in the crypto futures market.  Price Point  Bitcoin (BTC) opened its first day of trading in June at around $31,800. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is trading relatively flat and hasn't seen much price movement overnight.  Bitcoin has fallen 15% from this time a year ago, when it was trading at around $37,000.  Ether is trading at $1,900 at the time of writing and is down 26% from this time a year ago.  According to Charles Storry, head of growth at Phuture, a crypto index platform, the sell-off is just beginning.  “We are entering a 12-18 month bear market. I am bullish long term as this is short term fear and panic selling,” Storry said.  Altcoins saw weakness over the last 24 hours after some of the coins rallied on Tuesday. Cardano (ADA) has dropped 7%, Avalanche (AVAX) fell 5.7%, and Solana’s SOL declined 5%.  Tron’s TRX was the only gainer, climbing by 10% over the last 24 hours.  Optimism (OP), the token that powers the layer 2 Ethereum scaling tool Optimism, has dropped 65% from its listing price after its much anticipated airdrop.  Market Moves  Bitcoin Dominance in Derivatives  Open interest in bitcoin futures and perpetuals now account for 63% of the open interest in the crypto futures market. In early April, open interest was around 50%, according to data from Arcane Research. This has come as the global interest in the crypto market has seen a sharp decline.  BTC futures accounting for 63% of the crypto market are at their highest level since October 2021.  Bitcoin’s dominance in the derivatives market mirrors the cryptocurrency’s dominance in the wider market, which trended higher in May.  Joshua Lim, head of derivatives at Genesis Global Trading, said that this data suggests the speculative interest in altcoins is diminishing.  “Alts have had a rough run and a lot of liquidations and de-risking has taken speculators out of the market,” Lim said.

Past Performance of TRX TRX prices showcased a sharp V-shaped reversal from the $0.080 mark resulting in the $0.086 and the cup and handle pattern breakout.

42415443,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrZ1,1654088400,Paradigm Backs $5M Round in DAO Management Platform Dework,"Dework, which aims to be a combination of Trello and LinkedIn for Web 3, raised $5 million in a seed funding round that was co-led by crypto investing giant Paradigm and early-stage venture capital firm Pace Capital. The fresh capital will help Dework expand from its current three-person core team and several contributors, founder and CEO Lonis Hamaili told CoinDesk in an interview.  Dework is a Web 3-native collaboration tool where decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can organize internal and external teams, manage tasks and bounties in a transparent way, and help new members get started, according to a draft blog post provided to CoinDesk.  Other investors in the round included Balaji Srinivasan, a former chief technology officer at crypto exchange Coinbase, and Sandeep Nailwal, a co-founder of the Polygon crypto platform.  Dework targets common pain points for DAOs, which can have thousands of members and can’t use traditional project management tools like Jira or Linear that use a pay-per-seat pricing model, Hamaili said.  The organizations tend to have overly broad permissioning systems that simply split people into “member” and “admin” categories that don’t necessarily reflect the varying amounts of work, history and trust in the community. Members also can’t easily build up a clear work profile of contributions across multiple DAO projects.  On the project management side, Hamaili said that DAO communities want more visibility into the work of the core team and most active contributors. Dework also addresses the lack of transparency in tooling that makes it difficult for new contributors to quickly get up to speed and start participating. .  The platform has been used by a number of noted DAOs, including OpenDAO, AragonDAO, CityDAO (where Hamaili was the first engineering contributor) and ShapeshiftDAO.  “Dework gives Web3 builders all the tools and talent necessary to help ambitious DAOs reach their full potential,"" Paradigm researcher Anish Agnihotri wrote in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.

42393832,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpBcGx,1654083000,Merge Ahead: Ethereum’s Dress Rehearsal (and a Hiccup),"As Ethereum continues to lay the groundwork for its hotly anticipated transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), the network hit a major milestone on Tuesday with the launch of the Beacon Chain on the Ropsten test network (testnet).  The Beacon Chain is a proof-of-stake network that runs in parallel with Ethereum’s proof-of-work mainnet. It serves as a sort of practice area for Ethereum’s upcoming shift in consensus mechanisms, which will see the two chains “merge” together to become a single PoS network (hence, “the Merge”).  Developers expect the update to cut the network’s energy use by 99% and help Ethereum scale. By the most recent estimates from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, the much-delayed Merge is now slated for sometime in August.  Ropsten, Ethereum’s longest-running PoW testnet, is used by developers looking to experiment with and test new smart contracts.  With the launch of the PoS Beacon Chain on Ethereum's oldest testnet, the stage is set for what Ethereum core developer Tim Beiko is calling the Merge’s “first dress rehearsal.”  Within the next few weeks, Ropsten will undergo a merge identical to the one that will ultimately take place on Ethereum’s main network. It will be followed by additional merges on other Ethereum testnets.  Should these tests succeed, they will be the best sign yet that the Merge is, at long last, around the corner.  A Beacon Chain hiccup  Ethereum may finally be in the home stretch of its race (or jog) toward the Merge, but a security hiccup last week called a “reorg” briefly threw the network’s preparedness into question. The incident didn’t wind up having any serious consequences for users, but it highlighted the complexities that come from running a network without centralized control.  Blockchains work by organizing transactions into a series of individual “blocks.” The blocks are “proposed” to the network by a distributed community of workers – so-called “miners,” in the case of proof-of-work networks, or “validators” in the case of proof-of-stake networks like the Beacon Chain.  If enough workers come to the consensus that a given block is valid – meaning it contains only legitimate transactions – that block is added to the chain, and the process repeats.  Reorgs occur when some of a network’s validators (or miners) hold a different view on which block was last added to the blockchain. It leads to a situation where the network branches into two parallel chains – each adding new blocks in parallel with the other.  Ethereum’s recent “reorg” took place on the Beacon Chain. Though users can “stake” ether to become validators on the Beacon Chain, the chain won’t process user transactions until it merges with Ethereum’s mainnet. For this reason, the incident didn’t have a significant impact on users.  Reorgs can happen for a variety of reasons. In this case, some Beacon Chain validators were using updated software that enabled them to process blocks faster than some other validators. That led to some confusion between validators on which blocks had been added to the chain, causing a brief split in the network.  Eventually, validators converged on one “correct” chain and abandoned the other. The discrepancy was quickly resolved – but not until seven blocks had already been added to the rogue Beacon Chain offshoot.  Once validators came to an agreement on which chain to follow, it was business as usual; new blocks were issued onto the correct, canonical chain, and any transactions that made their way onto the other chain were relegated to new blocks.  What’s the big deal?  No harm, no foul, right? Not so fast. Reorgs can be exploited by bad actors to engage in malicious activities like double spending. They can also lead to rejected transactions, which is a major user experience bummer. Blockchains actively try to avoid reorgs, and last week’s Beacon Chain reorg was the longest Ethereum has experienced in years.  Thankfully, last week’s reorg doesn’t appear to have meant much for Ethereum in the long run. Had all validators updated their client software as recommended (as will be required by the time of the Merge), the reorg kerfuffle wouldn’t have taken place at all.  Nevertheless, the incident posed a stark reminder of what’s at stake should Ethereum’s Merge go sideways. With so many participants expected to participate as validators on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain, it also underscored the coordination challenges faced by Ethereum’s core development team as it works to roll out an update to thousands of unique network operators.

While centralized exchange Binance sees nearly $15 billion in trading volume every 24 hours, compared with Uniswap’s $1 billion, Uniswap has seen a $500 billion increase in trading volume since the fourth quarter of 2021, and it is used by more than 83% of DeFi users.

Wall Street doesn’t want the U.S. Federal Reserve to launch its own digital dollar.  WHY IT MATTERS: Wall Street bankers are arguing that the Federal Reserve launching its own digital dollar could crack the foundations of banking and harm consumers. In a letter, the American Bankers Association indicated that a potential central bank digital currency would mean “deposits accounting for 71% of banking funding are at risk of moving to the Federal Reserve.” Read more here.  Polkadot is adding Lido’s liquid staking to its network of blockchains.  WHY IT MATTERS: Polkadot’s Moonbeam, a connectivity layer between the Ethereum blockchain and services being built on Polkadot, is working with staking derivative platform Lido. The integration enables DOT holders to stake their assets in the form of xcDOT (cross-chain DOT) and receive stDOT (staked DOT) in return. With stDOT, holders are not only supporting the proof-of-stake network but are also gaining the capability to earn additional yield in decentralized finance (DeFi). Read more here.  Binance has registered Binance Italy as a virtual asset service provider.  WHY IT MATTERS: Just last year, the Binance Group was not authorized to provide investment services, and it wasn’t allowed to offer new futures and derivative positions to Italian citizens.

The recommendation comes as lawmakers reach the closing stages of landmark legislation known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, or MiCA, introducing an authorization regime for virtual asset companies within the 27-nation bloc.  Regulatory authorities responsible for authorizing or registering crypto exchanges and wallet providers should “be empowered to withdraw the authorisation/registration for serious breaches of AML/CFT [anti-money laundering and terrorist finance] rules,” said a report published Wednesday by the three European supervisory authorities responsible for overseeing banks, insurers and securities markets.  MiCA should “appropriately integrate AML/CFT issues in prudential supervision of entities,” said the report, which is looking at whether the anti-money laundering powers contained in rules for different financial sectors are up to scratch. MiCA introduces requirements for stablecoin issuers to hold sufficient capital reserves and to be monitored by regulators such as Germany’s BaFin.  One of the remaining wrinkles in the legislation concerns whether it should include stronger AML controls or leave the issue for a separate, wider review of dirty money rules.

In addition, the total crypto trading volume increased 3.37 times year on year. To be specific, futures contracts have grown the most by nearly 6 times, spot 2.3 times, and delivery contracts 2.36 times only. The overall data presented in the Review shows rapid growth in the futures market in 2021.

By 2025, it&apos;s predicted that corporations will be spending $20 billion annually on blockchain technical services. Tech giant IBM is investing more than $200 million in research and over 90% of European and US banks investigating blockchain options. Although only taking the world by storm over the past few years, blockchain technology is already on its way to becoming a legitimate disruptor in a slew of different industries. So what exactly does blockchain accomplish to make it so popular? Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets across a network. An asset can be tangible (e.g. a house, car, cash, or land) or intangible (e.g. intellectual property, patents, copyrights, or branding). Anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved. Blockchain technology is revolutionary because it allows businesses to receive information faster and more accurately. It provides immediate, shared, and transparent information stored on an immutable ledger which can only be accessed by permissioned network members.

The long history of two animals battling against each other on Wall Street has now paved its way into the crypto markets. After a long reign, the bulls have taken a step back and the bears have taken over. That said, most of us are aware that the market conditions right now aren&apos;t the most trader-friendly; stable coins have been destabilized and there&apos;s a bloodbath with red candlesticks taking dips. So, what could help a trader or an investor at this point? The simple answer is diversification, or the golden rule of never putting all your eggs in one basket. Striking the right balance in terms of diversification can sometimes be tough, which is why having the right mechanism or tool can help. What is diversification? Diversification is the strategy of spreading your assets across several asset classes to minimize your exposure to only one type. This method is intended to help minimize your portfolio&apos;s volatility over time and maximize returns by investing in different assets that would react differently under the same circumstances. Some of the benefits of diversification include: Loss risk minimization: Asset diversification reduces the risk of losing money in a single asset type. This occurs because if one asset or asset class performs poorly, another asset or asset class performs well. This helps to balance the outcome and decreases the risk of portfolio loss.

Continued buying strength can push ETH to trade above the $2000 price level. If the bulls continue to trade above the $2000 price level then the recovery would remain strong in the market.

35960,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/?p=237952,1654047022,Your NFTs: Are They Well Protected?,"NFTs are unquestionably the rage this decade. Everyone wants a piece of the NFT universe, whether it&apos;s Eminem or Justin Beiber or Adidas, Nike, or Disney. However, when an NFT sells for millions, it&apos;s likely that there are others on the internet waiting for that one mistake to take your million-dollar digital property and make it their own. It should come as no surprise that any wallet on the internet is vulnerable to being hacked and stolen. While the NFT sector is profitable, it&apos;s also full of scammers due to a lack of regulation. Because of blockchain&apos;s inherent security, it is highly unlikely that anyone will lose their assets as a result of a blockchain-level hack, but there are a growing number of other scams involving fake NFTs, price inflation by traders who sell NFTs to themselves, bugs that allow attackers to get massive discounts on popular NFTs, the increasing use of NFTs for money laundering, and so on—as such, being careful is of the utmost importance. We&apos;ll be looking at some simple practices that an NFT enthusiast could look into to protect their precious JPEGs better. Avoid communicating with strangers on social media The first point is as simple as can be. Avoid exchanging personal and private information with strangers, especially through a social network account.

42415433,U2msve444uc2I0ChHDVrDZ,1654047000,Polygon Increases KYC Scrutiny of Potential Investments and Grants in India,"Layer 2 side chain Polygon is requiring extensive KYC (Know Your Customer) details to provide funding, investments, grants or financial support to potential partners in India, said a person familiar with the matter.  Polygon, whose system runs alongside the Ethereum blockchain, is looking to be ""extremely compliant,"" according to the person, at a time when there is increased scrutiny from regulators.  The person said that ""there would be no grants to anyone who is unwilling to share full KYC details.""  ""Anybody legit should not be reluctant to share KYC details and therefore to avoid procedural delays. It's a requirement going forward,"" the person added.  Developers in India have recently been talking about the difficulty of acquiring funding or investment from Polygon, going as far as saying Polygon had altogether stopped funding projects in the country, said a separate industry source.  However, the source familiar with Polygon's decision clarified that the move is not a complete pause on funding to Indian projects but is related to increased government scrutiny.  Recent unfriendly crypto moves by Indian authorities have included imposing a stiff new crypto tax, cutting off payment processors from local exchanges after the rough local launch of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN), failing to support the industry after a plunge in trading volumes and moving ahead with a new crypto tax – a 1% deducted-at-source levy scheduled to begin on July 1.
