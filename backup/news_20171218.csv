42380172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MH3X,1513632646,Overstock's TZERO ICO Yet to Launch as Token Sale Stalls Unexpectedly,"UPDATE (18th December 11:56 BST): Following publication, Overstock published a press release anouncing that tZERO's sale of Simple Agreements for Future Equity had opened. The sale's white paper is only being shared with accredited investors, according to a spokesperson.      A planned initial coin offering (ICO) for Overstock blockchain subsidiary tZERO, scheduled to go live at midnight Monday, has yet to launch as originally anticipated.  While little is known about the now nearly day-long delay, a countdown clock on SAFTLaunch.com, the issuance portal for tZERO's token, has expired without any update to the company's website or social media accounts. Indeed, CoinDesk's calls to key Overstock executives, including CEO Patrick Byrne, went unreturned or unanswered today.  What is known, however, is that the delay has now occurred for longer than initially planned. An hour after the countdown clock expired, at around 6:00 UTC this morning, tZERO's public relations lead confirmed to CoinDesk that the sale had been delayed until 17:00 UTC. But as that time has passed and the countdown clock has again expired, the sale has still yet to launch.  TZERO's website currently now shows the countdown to sale at ""00:00:00:00,"" but there's no indication that the sale is live. And the sale is still shown as an ""upcoming deal"" on SAFTLaunch.com.  One interested investor contacted CoinDesk to say that SAFTLaunch has not been replying to questions about the sale, and some participants on social media reported similar issues.  The news is potentially impactful as TZERO's token sale was expected to be the largest in the cryptocurrency industry's history, seeking to raise $250 million according to statements Byrne gave to Yahoo Finance today.  The token has been touted as a way to pay the fees associated with various services on tZERO's alternative trading system (ATS), such as its digital locate receipts, which the company created, as Byrne notes, to eliminate the controversial practice of ""naked short selling.""

42380162,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MGph,1513630519,Hedge Fund Pro Miller Is '50 Percent' Invested in Bitcoin,"Investor Bill Miller said last week that his MVP1 hedge fund has half of its investments in bitcoin.  Miller, the chairman and chief investment officer at Miller Valued Partners, made the disclosure on Dec. 13 when speaking to WealthTrack podcast with Consuelo Mack.  ""It's just about 50 percent right now,"" the legendary hedge fund manager was quoted as saying, who added that the fund also holds bitcoin cash. Miller's involvement in bitcoin dates back several years when he bought stakes in 2013 and 2014 (at a claimed average cost of $350 apiece).  In October this year, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal, bitcoin was said to have comprised one-third of Miller's hedge fund, meaning that the manager has only boosted the stake size since then. At first, according to Miller, just 5% of the fund had been allocated to bitcoin.  And as of October, the value of the MVP1 fund was pegged at $154 million, and Miller Value Partners reported having more than $2 billion in assets under management as of September.  In the podcast, Miller took aim at those who have criticized the cryptocurrency, including billionaire investor Warren Buffet – who Miller called ""wrong"" about bitcoin back in 2014 – and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who infamously declared bitcoin a ""fraud"" earlier this year.  According to Miller, neither of them had fully thought the topic through.  ""I'm highly confident to say that not one of them had actually studied it carefully,"" he said during the podcast. ""That is to say, they have strong opinions about something they haven't really looked at.""  His comments come after weeks of escalating bitcoin prices, which at press time are trading at around $18,695, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  At the same time, subtle changes could be coming next for Miller's bitcoin-heavy hedge fund. Miller suggested during the podcast that his firm is looking at ways to decrease the amount of cryptocurrency it holds without having to sell any of the holdings.  ""I'd be fairly confident to say it won't be 50 percent of the fund for that much longer, which does not mean necessarily we are going to sell it,"" Miller explained, adding:  ""We are working on how to handle it without selling it.""

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) unveiled its new cryptocurrency resource website, which is aimed at educating the public about these wholly digital commodities. The site features links to a range of CFTC releases, including an October primer from its LabCFTC arm and information about futures launches from firms like Cboe and CME Group.  The agency wrote:  ""[Financial] technologies have the potential for significant or even transformational impact on CFTC regulated markets and the agency itself. One of the most recent marketplace developments driving a lot of interest is the rise in prominence of virtual currencies, specifically bitcoin.""  The information portal was launched on Friday, the same day the CFTC released its proposed definition for ""delivery"" in the context of cryptocurrency assets. The agency has since embarked on a 90-day comment period regarding the proposal, soliciting feedback from the public on an issue that had stoked criticism and beguiled regulators working on possible solutions.  The release perhaps represents a kind of normalization for bitcoin at the agency, which moved to classify bitcoin as a kind of commodity in 2015. Indeed, the CFTC's chief remarked earlier this month that, in his view, bitcoin is an unusual kind of commodity by the agency's standards.  ""I have said consistently that virtual currencies are unlike any commodity that the CFTC has dealt with in the past, and I know they pose challenges for the SEC as well,"" he said last week following remarks from the head of the SEC, Jay Clayton.

Reuters  reported yesterday that Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said in an interview on Sunday that he will ask Argentina, which is set to take control of the G20 presidency, to put bitcoin on the agenda during an upcoming gathering in April.  Le Maire was quoted as saying:  ""I am going to propose to the next G20 president, Argentina, that at the G20 summit in April we have a discussion all together on the question of bitcoin. There is evidently a risk of speculation. We need to consider and examine this and see how ... with all the other G20 members we can regulate bitcoin.""  How that conversation will play out remains to be seen. Representatives from G-20 nations have previously discussed the topic through the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which has been studying the tech since 2016.  Indeed, that Le Maire would want to push in this direction is perhaps not surprising, given France's proactive stance on regulation around the tech.  For example, earlier this month the French government gave its approval to new rules that will allow unregistered securities to be traded on a blockchain.  Financial regulators in France also launched an initial coin offering (ICO) initiative earlier this year, dubbed Project UNICORN, that effectively lays the groundwork for token sales to take place under the auspices of the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF).

If so, the development would mark a reversal from last week, when the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency reached new heights at $341.80, only to lose ground to bull market exhaustion.  However, most notably, the subsequent dip to $251.22 on Dec. 15 low is now proving short-lived.  As of Monday, LTC is trading back above $300, averaging $320 across global exchanges. As per CoinMarketCap, it has appreciated by 0.4 percent on the day, but the sharp recovery only underscores the market's strong ""buy the dip"" mentality.  And with the huge bitcoin (BTC) bull run showing some signs of fatigue near the $20,000 mark, investors could once again turn their attention towards litecoin and other alternative currencies.  The investor community also appears to expect LTC to re-test record highs soon, hinting that its already meteoric annual gains could be extended from its already staggering 7,000 percent.  Litecoin 4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  A series of higher lows as represented by the ascending trendline (blue line).

Still, in the short-term, the dips below $270 could be transient, courtesy of the upward sloping 10-day MA.

Around 7.6 billion won ($6.99 million) worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen at the time, along with the personal information of some 30,000 people. First reported in July, the data leak is believed to have led to the draining of funds from an unknown number of accounts.

42380150,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEwh,1513604125,The Transformed Role of Government in the Blockchain Era,"Dr. Aisha Bin Bishr is director general at Smart Dubai Office, a city-wide initiative to transform Dubai into the world's smartest and happiest city.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      Having been part of the U.A.E. government's rapid transformation over the last two decades, I find myself, for the first time, at an unusual junction: Business as usual or complete disruption and reassessment of the role of government and its relationship to its constituents.  The culprit for the disruption in this scenario is blockchain, the technology that has rattled the world in 2017 and brought back reminisces of the dot-com days – namely ""adapt or perish.""  The U.A.E. and Dubai, in particular, have chosen to adapt at every turn-point, and for 40-plus years this choice has served us well.  Here we are now, yet again, choosing not only to adapt but to embrace a technology that we believe has the features to not only change the way people interact with their government, but transform public sector service transactions and delivery.  To understand why, I'll first state that governments have long existed to manage societal growth through the provision of trusted public services.  Historically, the delivery of these services involved frequent and time-consuming interactions between public sector agencies and constituents. If you wished to buy a property, the government's role would be to authenticate the transaction and record it for future reference.  The purchaser in this scenario woul, therefore, be required to fill-out and present several documentations to ensure the government can do its ""authentication and recording"" role properly. The relationship between the two – government and individual – is purely  transactional: Give and take.  Governments around the world have believed for centuries that they are achieving their objective by fulfilling these traditional transactional roles – albeit through heavy reliance on manual processes and unnecessary labor work.  The happiness objective  The Dubai government differs from others around the world in that it aims to make Dubai the ""happiest city on Earth."" We aspire to touch the life of every individual to ensure that their everyday city experiences and interactions are efficient, seamless, safe and personalized.  In short, we want to give people back time they would have otherwise spent on filling paperwork and visiting government service centers.  More importantly, at the core of this vision is a belief in the profound power of emerging technologies to dramatically improve city experiences. A belief, we have put into motion with the release of the Dubai Blockchain Strategy in October 2016.  But, you might ask, why blockchain?  Dubai's rapid development in various economic sectors means that traditional processes need to be continuously updated to ensure efficiency and speed. Government effectiveness became increasingly imperative especially in government-to-consumer (G2C) and government-to-government (G2G) services.  In particular, the growth of the business, construction and tourism sectors saw the government needing tighter controls over activities such as permissions (e.g. permits and no objection certificates) and transaction verification and tracking.  Simple processes were getting ever more complicated with the addition of activities that were now in demand by the city's new businesses and residents. It was becoming clear that Dubai needed an agile solution to streamlining its growing government processes.  Transformation in practice  In response, Dubai launched a citywide ""Dubai Blockchain Strategy"" in October 2016, with the objective of executing all applicable transactions using blockchain by 2020.  The most applicable services are those that would benefit the most from the implementation of blockchain technology due to their need for third-party elimination, transaction ledgers, smart controls and automation.  The strategy establishes a roadmap for the introduction of blockchain technology to Dubai and the creation of an open platform to share the technology with cities across the globe.  We designed it essentially around three pillars that connect government, private sector and the global community because of our strong belief in the power of collaboration:  Government efficiency – implement blockchain technology in applicable government services.  Industry creation – support the creation of a blockchain industry through providing anenabling ecosystem that empowers start-ups and businesses.  Global leadership – lead the global thinking on blockchain technology and become the hub for blockchain knowledge, networks and skill development.  The first pillar of the Dubai Blockchain strategy is government efficiency.  Dubai aims to use blockchain to enable a paperless digital layer for all city transactions, converting millions of documents – covering everything from visa applications to bill payments to license renewals – into digital, blockchain-secured form.  In 2017, over 20 government use cases have been identified and designed, with many progressing into proof-of-concept phase. These cases include daily life experiences such as purchasing or renting a property, registering a student in school, obtaining medical treatment, and more. Dubai intends to first pilot these use cases on blockchain before it proceeds to full implementation in 2018 and beyond.  The second pillar of the strategy is industry creation. Smart Dubai aims to create an enabling ecosystem for citizens and startups to create new businesses using blockchain. In May 2017, the Smart Dubai Global Blockchain Challenge saw 21 startups fly into Dubai from 19 cities to pitch their best and brightest blockchain ideas, several of which are now being piloted around the city.  The third pillar of the Dubai Blockchain Strategy is international leadership. The strategy aims to position Dubai as a global thought leader in blockchain, through both formal and informal cross-border collaboration.  Final thoughts  Dubai's adoption of blockchain technology at a city-wide scale is a testament to its commitment to positively transform government from service provider to service enabler.  While major cities across the world reluctantly approach blockchain technology, Dubai has sought to be the success story that the world could emulate – in both the use of the technology itself and in achieving our happiness objective.  We believe blockchain technology, with its built-in efficiency, accountability and security, holds a key to achieving our vision.

42380157,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MF4F,1513601153,Bull Market Breather? Bitcoin Retreats After Run on $20k,"Bitcoin is trading on the back foot today following the bullish debut of futures on the CME.  Having clocked a new all-time high of $19,783 at 12:14 GMT yesterday, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) is trading at $19,178. Further, data source CoinMarketCap shows bitcoin (BTC) has depreciated by 2.77 percent in the last 24 hours.  And that remains the state of play after bitcoin crossed the $20,000 mark on Asian exchanges yesterday, but failed to follow suit on major Western exchanges. On Coinbase's GDAX exchange, for instance, bitcoin rose to a record $19,891 before falling to a low of $18,200 and recovering in line with the BPI.  As such, it remains to be seen whether the launch of BTC derivatives will bring institutional money into the cryptocurrency space. For now, it appears the BTC bulls are having a breather as the move to mainstream may have been priced-in.  The price chart analysis also indicates the potential for a pullback.  Bitcoin chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  Low volume lift: The rally from the Dec. 10 low of $13,501 lacks substance, i.e. volumes have steadily declined. Also, volumes have remained below the 30-day moving average since Dec. 12.  Potential bearish divergence: The relative strength index (RSI) has formed lower highs, while the price has clocked higher highs ($19,697 on Dec. 7 and $19,891 yesterday). A weak close (as per UTC) today would confirm bearish divergence.  The 5-day MA and 10-DMA are curled up in favor of the bulls.  View  The sharp recovery from the intra-day low of $18,200 to $19,350 is encouraging, but a pullback to $16,498 (23.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of Nov/Dec rally) cannot be ruled out, given the weak volumes and the potential for ""sell the news"" trading.  Also, a close today below $18,200 would confirm bearish price RSI divergence and could yield a deeper pullback to sub-$15,000 levels. History shows, BTC has witnessed a significant drop following the confirmation of the bearish RSI divergence on the daily chart.  On the higher side, $20,000 is a major resistance. A high volume breakout may open doors for $24,000 as expected by a significant minority in the markets.

42380153,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MF2z,1513596611,Bought Your First Bitcoin or Ether? Brace for the Fees,"I sent $25 of Bitcoin from one address (in Coinbase) to another (Kraken).        - $25 sent    - $16 fee    - $41 total    40% of the total transaction in fees.    unbelievable    — Kristian Freeman (@imkmf) December 8, 2017      Ready to send your first bitcoin? That will be $26 please...  Sure, that's on the high end of what you might pay to use the bitcoin blockchain today, but if you're new to the world of cryptocurrencies (and haven't invested that much), we understand seeing such a sky-high sum might be a shock. (Sorry, Kristian!)  Despite what you might have heard about the ""money of the future,"" the fact is bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) are both expensive – and experimental – today.  But while this might not be what you're used to (or even what you signed up for when purchasing), looking at the reasons behind blockchain costs can help you understand the technology, its weaknesses and where the ecosystem needs more dedicated minds to improve.  OK, so what's with fees in the first place?  To start, you're probably thinking this money is all going somewhere. And it is, just not a single place.  When you send a cryptocurrency transaction, you're paying for it to be included on the protocol's blockchain, which you can think of as something an official record of every token on the network ever spent (whether it's bitcoin, ether or something more exotic). Rather than holding this at a bank or a credit card firm, this ledger is distributed.  This means that should any one computer (or group of computers) go down, the network still has a copy showing that you own your asset. The bad news is you have to pay all those computers to process it.  Here, we'll introduce you to the first new person on our journey, the miner (or validator, depending on your network).  You don't necessarily know who he or she is, or which one is verifying your transaction – but they are doing work, so to speak, dedicating computing power, putting aside coins or doing some other cost-prohibitive function to help the network to determine which transactions to include in which block of the chain.  For this, they're rewarded with newly ""minted"" cryptocurrency.  OK, but why so much?  If that's confusing, you can think of it like this.  See, every cryptocurrency transaction is made up of a small amount of data, and most blockchains, have limited space for that data as a reference for all those transactions.  In this way, transaction fees represent how interested you are in getting your transaction through, right at that moment, and stored on the network permanently. As you can guess, the bigger the transaction fee – which the miners (or validators) get to collect – the higher your chances are of getting your transaction into the next block that's processed by miners.  While data limits and how they change vary from blockchain to blockchain (bitcoin has a hardcoded limit of 1 MB per block), in general developers and engineers caution against raising the limit too much, as it can lead to various technical problems.  Up until fairly recently, most crypto users didn't really notice these data limits, since the networks weren't brushing up against them. But as a new round of crypto investors and enthusiasts hit the market, pushing demand generally up, these data limits are being tested and the associated fees are going up (see chart below).  While it might not seem like it, increasing fees are actually a sign that bitcoin, ether and other cryptocurrencies are growing in popularity and use. But on the other hand, as it's a fairly recent development, your wallet might not be equipped to make it easy for you.  Ultimately, many wallets (the software that provides the interface with your cryptocurrency) make you decide, giving you the power to determine how much to pay.  Still, transactions without a fee or with too low of a fee during peak usage just sit in limbo.  They're not outright rejected, but it could take hours, even days, for the network to cool and miners to add the transaction to a block. Plus, as mentioned above, the higher the fee, the more likely it is for your transaction to get picked up by miners.  Deciding what fee is serviceable, though, is tricky.  To help users determine what fee is right, various sites offer calculators, and even some developers have stepped in to try and make that calculation less of a headache.  So, what's next?  The other option, and arguably the boldest move, is moving into cryptocurrencies that are less-used today.  Yet, the infrastructure around these options may still be limited (bitcoin cash, for example, has fewer merchants than bitcoin), and as such, you should be aware that not only might you have trouble transacting, but development may be ongoing to fix vulnerabilities.  Longer-term, blockchain engineers on many of the largest blockchains are working on a range of ""off-chain"" solutions that could help the technology scale to more users, all while slashing the cost of using the network, and your transaction fees.  While it's unclear when these solutions will be ready to deploy on the blockchain for the public's use, with scaling taking center stage during most technical discussions, many think relief might not take long.

42380149,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MEvR,1513580455,Boeing Eyes Blockchain in Bid to Fight GPS Spoofing,"A new patent filing from Boeing suggests that the aircraft manufacturing giant is looking at how blockchain can help protect in-flight GPS receivers.  In a patent application released last Thursday  by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the developer of the world’s most popular airliner details an ""onboard backup and anti-spoofing GPS system"" that would be used if a plane's primary system becomes unreliable or nonfunctioning.  GPS ""spoofing"" is a practicehttps://gps.stanford.edu/research/current-research/anti-spoofing by which counterfeit signals are used to effectively trick other receivers. Such attacks can be used to confuse a GPS receiver about the actual location of other objects.  According to the application, blockchain data would be used as a backup record of information in the event that the anti-spoofing system detects potential trouble.  The filing states:  ""The method further determines if the GPS signals, received by the GPS receiver, are spoofed GPS signals and, then, retrieves position data from the block-chain storage module if the GPS receiver is not receiving the GPS signals or is receiving spoofed GPS signals.""  The backup would store environmental information received from the GPS, allowing it to act as a failsafe to prevent pilots from getting lost by providing all of the information a GPS normally would. The system can be applied to any type of vehicle, both manned and unmanned, according to the application.  Further, the design is positioned in the filing as a response to a lack of fail-over technologies that can verify data about a vehicle's location. As a result, if a GPS platform does suffer an outage or spoofing attack, ""navigators, air traffic controllers, and mission planners are unable to adjust and respond with confidence.""

42380154,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8MF0T,1513573259,Where Have All the Private Blockchains Gone?,"Dr. Gideon Greenspan is the founder and CEO of Coin Sciences, the company behind the MultiChain platform for private blockchains.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's 2017 in Review.      The past six months have seen a great deal of excitement in the crypto space – bitcoin passed $10,000, billions were raised in ICOs and mainstream financial institutions like CME Group and CBOE launched cryptocurrency-based derivatives.  This is all a far cry from this time last year when bitcoin was still below $1,000 and the total market cap of the entire space was $15 billion, less than 5% of today’s figure.  So, what were we talking about in December 2016 then? The answer, for those who don't remember, is private or permissioned blockchains, also known as ""distributed ledgers.""  These systems share many technical similarities with the open blockchains underlying cryptocurrencies, but are designed to be used by a closed group of known parties. As you may have noticed, these days we hear a lot less about them.    So, has this notion, which claimed to embrace the blockchain revolution, while emptying it of its true meaning, been consigned to the dustbin of history? With no promise of censorship-free money and no native token for speculation, were permissioned blockchains nothing more than a fleeting sideshow?      It seems that more than a few people have reached that conclusion.      Indeed, when CoinDesk Editor-in-Chief Pete Rizzo approached me to write a piece for the series, his prompt was the suggestion that ""we're probably about due for a private blockchain return in 2018.""      However well-intentioned, this came across as a generous conciliatory expression of optimism for a technology that has lost its place in the limelight.      In reality, however, the state of play for permissioned blockchains is rather more nuanced, demonstrating both advances and setbacks during 2017.    Steady growth    First, let’s look at the tech itself.      During 2017, several prominent open-source blockchain platforms released a production-ready version 1.0, including MultiChain (our product), R3's Corda and Hyperledger Fabric – not to forget Chain Core which reached 1.0 in late 2016.      While it's certainly still early in the development cycle for permissioned blockchains, programmers now have several credible choices of infrastructure on which to build their applications.      Second, let me share some of our numbers, which point to a nascent but rapidly growing niche.      In the 12 months to November 2016, MultiChain received around 23,000 downloads. For the subsequent 12 months, the comparable figure is 55,000. During the past year, organic traffic to the MultiChain website doubled from 21,000 to 41,000 monthly visitors.      In the same period, our partner program expanded from 13 to 62 member companies. While we’re not privy to others’ figures, they no doubt show similar rapid growth in developer engagement.    Narrowing niche    So if the numbers are up across the board, why the negative sentiment?      The answer is that permissioned blockchains are unlikely to be deployed in the way and on the scale originally anticipated. The great dream of moving mainstream financial assets en masse from centralized to distributed ledgers has been undermined by a key characteristic of blockchains – their radical transparency.      Put simply, for many use cases the participants in a blockchain see too much of what each other are doing. This so-called ""problem of confidentiality,"" originally seen as a minor setback, has proven itself to be the central factor in determining the feasibility of many blockchain applications.      It's true that several advanced techniques, such as ring signatures, confidential assets and zero-knowledge proofs, are available or being developed to mitigate the problem. But it remains to be seen whether these can truly allay fears of data leakage, and if the resulting systems provide a sufficient advantage over traditional centralized intermediaries.      But if permissioned blockchains aren’t being used in the way first envisaged, then why is interest still growing in this technology? Why are more and more people working with our platform and others?      The answer is that developers have been finding many applications for permissioned blockchains which are different from those first imagined.    In case this surprises you, remember that bubble wrap was intended as a new type of wallpaper and the internet was designed for military use. As is so often the case with new technologies, permissioned blockchains are being used in surprising and unexpected ways.  What's being built    We recently published a blog post describing some ways in which  MultiChain is being used in production. If we look at these uses and other  projects launching soon, they can be separated into two main categories.      First, permissioned blockchains can serve as the backbone for alternative or niche financial systems, in which the cost of setting up a trusted intermediary to manage a centralized ledger is not justified by the assets being transacted. In these cases, the blockchain allows a safe financial system to be set up quickly and easily, at the cost of reduced confidentiality between its participants.      Second, permissioned blockchains are being used to create secure multiparty timestamped records of important pieces of information.      These shared records are an alternative to (a) having a single trusted party maintaining a centralized record or (b) multiple parties maintaining their own records independently. A blockchain enables a group to maintain a provably single view of the truth, updated in real-time, without ceding control of this truth to any individual participant.      In a broader context, permissioned blockchains can be viewed as a new approach to integrating the IT systems of multiple organizations or enterprises. These types of integration entail a three-way trade-off between confidentiality, reconciliation and disintermediation. Blockchains sit at a particular point in the space defined by that trade-off, when confidentiality is less important. Other points in the space are occupied by centralized databases and point-to-point messaging.      To summarize, despite their technical similarities to cryptocurrency blockchains, permissioned blockchains are being used for entirely different things. They don’t represent a speculative investment opportunity or the possibility of financial or social transformation. Rather, they are a new and useful addition to the toolkitfor enterprise IT.    Disagree? CoinDesk is looking for submissions to its 2017 in Review series.

In what constitutes the fourth effort to launch a class-action lawsuit against the controversial blockchain project, new court filings from Dec. 13 on behalf of plaintiff Bruce MacDonald notably call for a temporary restraining order on the assets raised during the token sale.  Among the defendants named are Tezos founders Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, Dynamic Ledger Solutions, Inc., the Tezos Foundation, Johann Gevers, Diego Ponz and Guido Schmitz-Krummacher (who reportedly resigned last week as one of the foundation's three board directors, according to Reuters). Cryptocurrency brokerage Bitcoin Suisse AG and its co-founder, Niklas Nikolajsen, were also named as defendants.  The filings allege that the Tezos token sale's organizers violated U.S. securities laws, echoing accusations contained in the class-action complaints previously filed. Previous lawsuits filed in relation to the Tezos ICO contained allegations of securities law violations and investor fraud.  Last week's filing stated:  ""In sum, Defendants capitalized on the recent enthusiasm for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to raise funds through the ICO, illegally sold unqualified and unregistered securities, used a Swiss-based entity in an unsuccessful attempt to evade U.S. securities laws, and are now admittedly engaged in the conversion, selling, and possible dissipation of the proceeds that they collected from the Class through their unregistered offering.""  The application for the temporary restraining order, submitted on Dec. 14, argues that the Tezos ICO holdings are worth in excess of $1 billion. It seeks to prevent the sale or transfer of the digital assets raised during the sale, alleging that ""as cash, it can disappear quickly into the void.""

Coming months after the Chicago-based derivatives exchange operator first revealed plans for dedicated bitcoin offerings, the launch took place at 6 p.m EST. At that time, the opening price for the January contract was $20,650, $1,150 over the last price on CME's reference rate ($19,500).  All told, more than 200 Jan. 2018 contracts were bought during the first hour, CME data reveals.
