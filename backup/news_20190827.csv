42403204,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGYL,1566941108,Libra Association's Crypto Members Remain Unfazed by Regulatory Backlash,"Since first being announced in June, Facebook's proposed Libra cryptocurrency has drawn the ire of lawmakers and regulators worldwide.  But, according to sources close the Libra Association, that was to be expected.  ""We always knew this was something that was going to be hard,"" one such source told CoinDesk.  However, some of the project's founding 28 members – which include Visa, PayPal, Uber and other tech and payments giants – haven't remained as steadfast in their commitment, according to recent media reports.  The Financial Times reported last week that two unnamed members of the Libra Association were considering pulling out of the project, citing the harsh glare of the ""regulatory spotlight.""  Follow-up reporting by CoinDesk, however, has found that the Libra Association's crypto contingent – Coinbase, Xapo, Anchorage and Bison Trails – remains publicly optimistic about the project.  Unshaken?  Libra's crypto-native members seem ready to ride this one out.  Both Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Union Square Ventures – the two venture capital firms in the Libra Association most closely associated with blockchain investing – confirmed to CoinDesk that they remain committed to the project.  The CEOs of alternative banking company Xapo and blockchain infrastructure startup Bison Trails both confirmed that they are Libra members with no intention of leaving.  A spokesperson for custody startup Anchorage wrote to CoinDesk:  ""We believe in the mission of Libra and are proud to be a Founding Member of the Libra Association. We are confident that the Association and its members will work through regulatory concerns and look forward to continued conversations with policymakers.""  The only company in the crypto space to give CoinDesk anything short of a categorically affirmative answer was Coinbase.  A spokesperson wrote: ""We remain a member, as announced in June."" (Coinbase declined to further clarify its commitment.)  While some companies may be considering leaving, a source close to the Libra Association told CoinDesk that many more have expressed interest in joining, despite the regulatory uncertainty.  Members pay at least $10 million to join, getting in return a Libra investment token that entitles them to a share of the interest generated by the massive pool of fiat currencies and low-risk assets that back the blockchain's stablecoin.  A source with knowledge of the matter said Facebook and other Libra Association members are currently working toward ratifying the non-profit's charter.  Most of the narrative surrounding Libra so far has been driven by intense government scrutiny. The effort's initial helmsman, David Marcus, was grilled by Congress – twice. European Union regulators are reportedly investigating ""anti-competitive behavior"" related to the project. Tech giant Huawei has reportedly urged Chinese authorities to create a rival.  Meanwhile, a report from Bloomberg Law suggests the Libra Association may begin a new phase of public messaging. According to the report, an Aug. 26 email from the association's managing partner, Bertrand Perez, was clear:  “It’s time for us to speak up individually and collectively and build some momentum coming into the end of 2019.”  Zack Seward contributed reporting.

42403200,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGUP,1566939642,Venezuelan Pharmacy Chain to Accept Cryptocurrency Payments,"A Venezuelan pharmacy franchise will now accept dash cryptocurrency payments, through an integration with Panda Exchange’s proprietary payments system.  The Farmarket retail chain is piloting a dash-enabled point of sale system, XpayCash, that will allow customers to make instant cryptocurrency transactions, the Dash Core Group announced Monday. The payment rail will be rolled out to 22 pharmacy locations over the next two quarters.  Dash representatives will provide on-site training during the first two months of operations as part of the company’s efforts to onboard potential cryptocurrency users in the country, Panda Exchange partner Robert Mozo said in a press release.  Of the approximately 4,900 merchants that accept dash globally, nearly half are located in Venezuela, the press release said.  Much of this headway has been made by DiscoverDash, which began by offering dash training to smaller firms and family owned businesses, but has grown to attract more established enterprises.  Additional onboarding efforts were led by Dash Merchant Venezuela, which succeeded in making ""business connections"" by providing crypto-enabled POS to businesses, before shutting down for employee salary inconsistencies.  ""We expect our partnership with Panda in Colombia and Farmarket in Venezuela to be a substantial move toward a purchase driven economy, where not only Venezuelans in Caracas will be able to pay directly in stores with Dash, but also their relatives in Colombia and elsewhere will be able to buy medicine from abroad and resolve health issues for their relatives and loved ones,"" said Ryan Taylor, CEO, Dash Core Group, in a statement.  Venezuela is quickly becoming a hotbed for actual cryptocurrency use cases. In May inflation reached 815,000 percent, following a one year high above 1.7 million percent. Under these economic conditions, cryptocurrencies present a store of value as well as stable form of payment for citizens. XPay charges a 3.99 percent transaction fee.

42403205,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGaJ,1566938977,Judge Confirms Ruling: Craig Wright to Forfeit 50% of Bitcoin Holdings,"A corroborating order has been filed in Craig Wright’s sanctions and contempt hearing.  In a court document published Tuesday  , Magistrate Judge Bruce E. Reinhart confirmed that Wright, the self-declared inventor of bitcoin, must forfeit half his crypto mined prior to 2014 to Ira Kleiman as well as half his intellectual property. Additionally, Wright is ordered to pay the attorney’s fees and related expenses incurred in this motion.  The court found Wright had argued in bad faith, perjured himself and admitted false evidence during the motion.  The ongoing trial began in 2018, when Kleiman – the brother of Wright’s late business partner Dave Kleiman – sued for half the bitcoin holdings in the so-called Tulip Trust, alleging that Wright defrauded the family's estate.  The magistrate said:  “Dr. Wright and David Kleiman entered into a 50/50 partnership to develop Bitcoin intellectual property and to mine bitcoin; (2) any Bitcoin-related intellectual property developed by Dr. Wright prior to David Kleiman's death was property of the partnership, (3) all bitcoin mined by Dr. Wright prior to David Kleiman's death (""the partnership's bitcoin"") was property of the partnership when mined; and (4) Plaintiffs presently retain an ownership interest in the partnership's bitcoin, and any assets traceable to them.”  Accordingly, Wright’s argument – that the bitcoin is inaccessible due both to his former business partner’s death as well as a complicated encryption mechanism – was found to be in bad faith.  The sanctions are Wright's alone, Reinhart wrote.  ""I find without hesitation that sanctions are not warranted against Dr. Wright’s counsel,"" the judge wrote, adding:  ""Counsel has zealously and ethically advocated for their client. Counsel has unfailingly been candid with this Court, even when Dr. Wright’s conduct and conflicting statements have created awkward situations for counsel.""  Jason Gottlieb, partner at Morrison Cohen LLP, said the ruling was “atypical” procedurally, and the district judge overseeing the trial may not accept Reinhart’s decision without amendment.  Previously, Wright’s testimony was declared to be “inconsistent” by District Judge Beth Bloom.  Kleiman was represented by Kyle Roche and Velvel Freedman of Roche Freedman LLP, while Wright was represented by Rivero Mestre LLP.  Kleiman must alert Wright of the appropriate costs due to him on or prior to Sept. 20. While this ruling does determine liability, further discovery for the trial may be underway.

On a company blog post, multi-sig P2P bitcoin exchange Hodl Hodl announced the extension of its services to China. Hodl Hodl said Google's reCAPTCHA service, used by the exchange and blocked by Chinese firewalls, was to blame.  As part of its on-boarding and trading services, Hodl Hodl uses Google’s reCAPTCHA service to identify bots. By moving off of Google’s service in China, Hodl Hodl was able to open up Chinese traders to its platform.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Hodl Hodl team manager Arthur Zaharov said the exchange has always accepted Chinese traders, the problem came down to China's Great Firewall. Moreover, Hodl Hodl expects China to be a large market moving forward:    ""For the privacy and security of our customers, we don't publicly provide data on P2P trading on our platform, but I can say that there's a huge demand in this country for P2P trading, especially after the biggest centralized exchanges disappeared from radar some time ago.      And yes, we plan to firmly gain a foothold in the market and expect China to be one of the biggest markets we serve.""    P2P trading expands  In May, P2P bitcoin trading site LocalBitcoins blocked Iranian traders from using the platform. As CoinDesk reported at the time, the move most likely came down to U.S. sanctions against the Iranian government and economy.  As Iranian traders were cut off from the site, they sought and found alternatives such as Hodl Hodl.  In fact, when LocalBitcoins went dark in Iran, Hodl Hodl had just added Farsi language support. It is now adding Mandarin right now.  Currently, Hodl Hodl is working on access for U.S. traders, the only country the service does not operate in.

That statement is erroneous and has been corrected.    ---------    Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, announced it will join the USD payments platform, Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN).  Through the network, Gemini's institutional clients are now able to transact in U.S. dollars “24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year,” according to a statement made Aug. 27. This activity was previously prohibited by the traditional hours of operation for banks, which “shackled” fiat withdrawals and deposits.  By integrating with the cloud-based SEN API, the exchange can form counterparty relationships with other members of the network to make instantaneous transfers. Silvergate Bank, an industry financial service provider, supports the network of digital currency exchanges and digital currency investors, to facilitate the movement of U.S. dollars between participants.  According to the bank’s Form S-1 filing:  “The SEN has a powerful network effect that makes it more valuable as participants and utilization increase, leading to 374% growth in SEN transaction volumes in the first six months of 2019 compared to the first six months of 2018.”  The SEN launched in early 2018 and has since enrolled approximately 77 percent of Silvergate’s eligible commercial clients.  Silvergate serves some of the cryptocurrency industry’s biggest firms including Coinbase, Bitstamp, Genesis Trading and Blocktower Capital.

42403198,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfGTQ,1566920110,4 Agencies Are Investigating Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX,"At least four different law enforcement and regulatory agencies are investigating defunct Canadian crypto exchange QuadrigaCX, a new report by bankruptcy trustee Ernst & Young (EY) said.  George Kinsman, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee and EY employee overseeing the exchange's shutdown and the return of funds to its users, wrote a new report Monday sharing some information about EY's ongoing attempts to recover crypto and fiat for its creditors.  The document outlines the different investigations surrounding the exchange, as well as EY's motion to transfer QuadrigaCX's ongoing bankruptcy proceedings from Nova Scotia to Ontario, which the Big Four auditor says will reduce costs moving forward.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), FBI and reportedly an Australian investigative agency are all looking into the project, as CoinDesk previously reported. There also appears to be another investigation, though the agency behind it has not been disclosed.  ""The Trustee is aware of at least four (4) independent active law enforcement or regulatory reviews in progress which have included inquiries or in some cases formal requests for documents and/or data disclosure from the Trustee,"" Kinsman wrote Monday. ""Other agency requests may subsequently materialize.""  One of these requests is subject to a confidentiality requirement, and Kinsman cannot share any further details, he said. There may also be statutory restrictions.  Kinsman expects law enforcement and regulatory agencies to continue their investigations, however, and says their ""demands may be significant,"" adding:  ""Furthermore, as a result of the confidentiality and non-disclosure restrictions inherent in these processes, the Trustee is unable to share details with and obtain approval of its activities from the Inspectors and therefore will require ongoing direction from a court. In addition, given the complexity of the requests made or anticipated to be made of the Trustee, it is expected that multiple court attendances will be required to obtain assistance with these issues and provide direction to the Trustee.""  Quadriga collapsed earlier this year when founder and CEO Gerald Cotten – and the exchange's only actual employee – was reported dead. He was also the only individual with access to the exchange's holdings, though subsequent investigations revealed that Cotten had used customer funds to purchase personal luxury items (such as private aircraft and boats), as well as margin trade small-cap cryptocurrencies (like OMG and DOGE).  Venue change?  Kinsman also reported that EY is filing to have Quadriga's ongoing bankruptcy process shifted out of its current jurisdiction in Nova Scotia to Ontario. He believes that this will reduce costs for the bankruptcy process in the long run, as well as streamline the bankruptcy process.  Some of the court appearances EY might request will come on ""an urgent and confidential basis,"" which may be easier to arrange in Toronto than in Nova Scotia, Kinsman wrote.  ""The Trustee appreciates that the Nova Scotia Court has a busy docket which may not easily be able to accommodate the anticipated multiple attendances, potentially on short notice,"" he said, adding:  ""Given the above and the fact that the majority of the professionals expected to be involved with the court attendances are based in Toronto, the Trustee expects that it would be more cost-effective for future motions to be heard by a court in Toronto, eliminating the need for a significant number of professionals to incur costs to travel from Toronto to Halifax.""  The majority of the attorneys and a plurality of creditors are also based out of the Toronto area, meaning it would be easier for individuals to attend hearings if they wish to, he wrote. EY is also managing a significant amount of its document production process through its Toronto team.  Regardless of the move, EY's remaining tasks include managing its ongoing claims process, which concludes on Aug. 31; raising funds by selling certain assets belonging to Cotten's estate; and continuing its efforts with law enforcement agencies.  Kinsman will provide updates on the claims and asset recovery processes at a later date, he wrote, adding that ""some assets have been monetized to date in accordance with [a previous] Asset Preservation Order.""  There will be a hearing  in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on the morning of Sept. 10, where a judge will approve or reject the motion to move the proceedings.

The underlying technology is being provided by KT, the country's No. 2 telecom company and majority owner of BC Card.  With a KT Hyperledger Fabric-based offering, BC Card is processing the ordering and exchanging of points paid out by affinity partners, VIP points and vouchers. More advanced applications, such as the settlement of payments and the management of documents, have not been achieved yet.  BC Card had been handling the rewards manually but in the first half of 2019 it began to develop a blockchain application to do the work. It now shares the appropriate ledgers with rewards partners so that settlement can be automated and seamless.  The company says that a number of benefits have been achieved. Processing times have been reduced by 50 percent, while errors have also been reduced. The article said that the company plans to apply blockchain technologies to additional tasks in the second half, though it did not provide details on what they may be.  KT has been an active proponent of blockchain technologies and an early mover. The company, which counts NTT Docomo among its largest shareholders, introduced its own blockchain network in July 2018. Last month, it was announced that it would be part of a consortium – which includes Samsung Electronics, a number of large banks and the other telecom companies – creating a blockchain-based system for digital identification.  The company is now especially focused on utilizing blockchain over its new 5G network and introduced its 5G-based GIGA Chain in April.  Korean financial institutions are rushing to apply blockchain technologies to consumer credit. In July, Shinhan Card said that it had patented a blockchain system that allows for cardless credit transactions. Earlier this month, the Woori Financial Group said that it is working with Ground X, Kakao's public blockchain, and may use the technology for Woori Card settlement.

Data firm Nomics announced Tuesday its ""Transparent Volume"" service which calculates the percentage of real volume traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. By tracking the amount of cryptocurrency moving through an exchange, Nomics claims it can empower investors in real-time.  (Image via Nomics)  Backed by notable investors like Coinbase Ventures and CoinDesk owner Digital Currency Group, the data provider launched in 2018. Much like Bitwise's report, Nomics’ transparency definition comes from the availability of granular historical trading data.  Speaking with CoinDesk, CEO and co-founder Clay Collins pointed toward the regulatory hurdles lack of data transparency is creating:  “We currently list 3,873 assets on Nomics (2,502 of which are actively traded). The cutoff to be in the top quartile of actively traded assets in terms of percent transparent volume is around 1 percent. That is, if you have over 1 percent transparent volume for your cryptoasset, you're in the top quartile.”  Of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only binance coin has a transparency rating over 30 percent, Collins said.  Providing an API service for institutional investors, Collins says Transparent Volume is for investors of all stripes. Pointing towards Bitwise’s example, which released its SEC study in March, Nomics says transparency is found in the data.  ""Our transparent volume metric is intended to help institutions, state actors, and investors assess the percentage of reported trading volume for a given crypto asset that is auditable and transparent,"" a release said.  Crypto data integrity continues to be an issue across the space. A report from CoinDesk in July showed the ease of one Moscow student faking trading volume for only a $15,000 fee.  Like Nomics, data provider Messari Crypto launched a similar product – its ""Real 10"" 24-hour volume metric – last spring.

42382590,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEJx,1566910971,"Facebook's Libra Project Launches Bug Bounty With $10,000 Max Reward","Facebook is gunning to get more external contributions to the cryptocurrency project Libra, starting with a bug bounty program that pays security researchers up to $10,000 in rewards.  The Libra Association, a nonprofit backed by a coalition of companies like Visa and PayPal that are interested in supporting Facebook’s new blockchain ecosystem, previously announced plans for the bounty program that went live Tuesday.  “There’s a variable amount of rewards based on bugs,” Diogo Monica, Anchorage cofounder and Libra Association member, told CoinDesk. “This is great for the [Libra] community, this is consistent with the values of the [infosec] community in general.”  This bug bounty program attracted unanimous praise from association members, an important political step even beyond technical benefits. The Financial Times reported earlier this month that two of these firms might pull out entirely due to regulatory concerns. For example, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who heads the House Financial Services Committee, released a statement on Sunday repeating her concerns about “allowing a large tech company to create a privately controlled, alternative global currency.”  Within that context, fostering volunteer contributions to open-source aspects of the project may be more important than ever. As such, the Libra Association is expanding the beta program with 50 external researchers to welcome any member of the public to report vulnerabilities in the code, through a partnership with the HackerOne bug bounty platform.  “We hope that developers will bring a diversity of perspectives and expertise to this initiative while holding the Libra Blockchain to the highest security standard,” Aanchal Gupta, security director at Facebook subsidiary Calibra, said in a statement.  Such bounty programs are the norm in cybersecurity circles, offering significant value to the project with regards to both insights and public trust. Plus, Libra Association communications lead Dante Disparte added that the Libra testnet is still under development. As such, vulnerabilities found now could significantly impact the final version.  “Some of the initiatives that Libra Association is doing is very forward-thinking,” Jesse Spiro, head of policy at the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis, told CoinDesk. “Having problems that are already beginning to be identified, by being very proactive and strategic, is a good thing.”  Overall, there are already developers experimenting with the Libra testnet, including dozens of teams that applied to the Libracamp program based in Israel, which isn’t officially affiliated with Facebook.  With regards to getting regulatory sign-off, Disparte said in a statement:  “We will not launch the Libra Blockchain until regulatory concerns have been taken into account and required regulatory approvals have been received.”  Facebook image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/08/27/facebooks-libra-project-launches-bug-bounty-with-10000-max-reward,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ee12e65cc183dd1eb5a5d40d123610f0bcad79d7-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Now it's bringing that conviction to the fore by hiring for a new compliance team to manage the many legal pitfalls it will face.  For example, the company is looking for a specialist that will ""lead the identification and analysis of our regulatory requirement and create policies, procedures and controls to ensure Calibra is fully compliant with all Sanctions requirements."" The job posting appeared on Facebook's career website overnight.  The sanctions lead will be working with Calibra's legal and policy teams, interact with Facebook's partners as well as the government agencies and regulators to ensure the product complies with worldwide requirements.  Facebook is also looking for additional brainpower to enforce Calibra's general legal compliance efforts. One posting, for a Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) leader, calls for a skilled banking executive to ensure Calibra's policies ""are designed to comply with BSA/AML related laws and regulations globally.""  Other related jobs currently open include head of compliance and a head of fraud. The career website is currently listing 27 jobs at Calibra alone, among the 47 jobs related to Facebook's blockchain work.  Facebook posted a number of data-science jobs at Calibra in an effort to understand how people interact with the app, including an economics researcher.  All of these new hires aims to help Facebook engender trust in its system. The Libra project, announced earlier this summer with support from the world's leading financial organizations, raised concerns worldwide. Congress grilled the project's head David Marcus during two hearings, citing concerns for the project's implications for the U.S. monetary system. They were also concerned with fraud prevention, and data privacy.  An anti-trust investigation into Calibra in the European Union did not make matters easier for Facebook. As now both the U.S. and E.U. authorities are concerned with the project's scale and consequences, two out of 28 members of the Libra Association told FT they wanted out.  Facebook is also strengthening its lobbying efforts. As reported Tuesday morning, Facebook hired Washington D.C.-based lobbyist John Collins, previously the head of policy at Coinbase, to work on “issues related to blockchain policy.”  Earlier in August, Facebook also hired Susan Zook of Mason Street Consulting, who previously worked as an aid to Senator Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).

42382600,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEU1,1566904597,Bitcoin May Suffer Deeper Drop Below This Price Average,"View  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) below the 12-week exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $9,940, could yield a deeper drop to levels below $9,000. The EMA has served as strong support in the last six weeks.  The slide below the 12-week EMA, if any, could recharge engines for a break above June's high of $13,880, historical data indicates.  BTC risks falling to levels below $9,500 if prices end the day (UTC) below the 100-day moving average (MA) at $10,025.  A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above $12,000 is needed to revive the bull market.      The bitcoin price rally has stalled over the last nine weeks and the cryptocurrency could suffer a deeper pullback if the newfound support at $9,940 is breached.  The top cryptocurrency by market value broke into a bull market in the first week of April and tripled in value by rising to $13,880 on Bitstamp at the end of June.  The price rally, however, has run out steam in the last nine weeks with the cryptocurrency repeatedly failing to post sustainable gains above the $12,000 mark.  While the upside has been capped above $12,000, the downside has been restricted at the 12-week exponential moving average (EMA) line since mid-July.  Notably, the cryptocurrency has defended the 12-week EMA on a weekly closing basis in five out of the last six weeks.  Hence, acceptance below that key EMA, currently at $9,940, may invite stronger selling pressure, leading to a deeper price drop, possibly to levels below $9,000.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,140, representing 1.70 percent losses on the day.  Weekly chart        Bitcoin broke into a bull market with a 26 percent price rise in the first week of April. The bullish breakout happened four weeks after the 12-week EMA bottomed out.  That EMA has put a floor under prices in five out of the last six weeks, as noted earlier. So far, however, the defense of the key price support has failed to draw bids.  In fact, the bounce seen after the defense of the key EMA in the last week of July ended up creating a bearish lower high at $12,325.  Also, the moving average convergence divergence histogram has crossed below zero for the first time since February, confirming a bearish reversal.  Further, the chaikin money flow (CMF), which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, continues to chart lower highs, a sign of weakening bullish momentum.  Hence, BTC could find acceptance below the 12-week EMA at $9,940 and drop to $8,500 (July 2018 high) over the next few weeks. On the way lower, BTC may find support at $9,049 (July low).  Weekly chart (2016-2017)  As can be seen, BTC charted higher lows below the 12-week EMA throughout the rally from lows near $350 seen in January 2016 to a record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017.  If history is a guide, then the slide below the 12-week EMA in the next few weeks, if any, could end up recharging engines for the next leg higher in prices.  As for the next 24 hours, the focus is on the 100-day moving average, currently at $10,025.  Daily chart  Bitcoin has been sidelined above the 100-day MA line since Aug. 22. A high-volume break below that average would put the focus back on the bearish lower highs (marked by arrows) and open the doors to $9,467 (Aug. 15 low).  On the higher side, a move above the bearish lower high of $10,956 (Aug. 20 high) is needed to strengthen bullish pressures and open the doors for $12,000.

The company said in an announcement on Tuesday that those who committed include investors like NEO blockchain's NGC Ventures, TechCrunch founder's Arrington XRP Capital and tzero investor 11-11 Ventures, among others.  Though set up as an independent entity separate from the Algorand Foundation and Algorand LLC, which oversee the development of the Algorand blockchain, Algo Capital invests exclusively on projects within the Algorand economy.  The firm said the fund will focus on projects that are building applications and infrastructure on Algorand to accelerate the adoption of the blockchain's native cryptocurrency Algo as a means of payment.  “Our investment approach specifically targets companies that are creating the next great blockchain applications and infrastructure solutions, and as a result, helping to speed blockchain adoption and bring millions of new users into the Algorand network,” Algo Capital's founder and managing partner Arul Murugan said in the statement.  The firm added it received all commitments to the fund in the Algo crypto, which will be the primary method for all capital calls. An undisclosed portion of its capital investments are also comprised of Algo to let portfolio companies use the cryptocurrency as a means of payment.  The fund's launch comes months after the Algorand Foundation raised around $60 million via an auction. In October last year, the project raised $62 million in a private sale.  Based on data from CoinMarketCap, the Algo crypto is traded at about $0.5 as of press time, down 80 percent since June, when it was first launched for trading.

42382585,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sE9t,1566898249,Coinbase's Ex-Policy Head Will Lobby for Facebook's Libra Crypto,"Facebook has hired a lobbying firm led by a former head of policy at the crypto exchange Coinbase amid regulatory pushback from U.S. lawmakers over its Libra crypto project.  The lobbying disclosure database compiled by ProPublica shows the Washington D.C.-based FS Vector registered with the congress on Aug. 23 that it has signed on Facebook as a retainer client starting from Aug. 5 to work on ""issues related to blockchain policy.""  Based on the filing, FS Vector's partner John Collins will be the lobbyist for Facebook. According to his LinkedIn profile, Collins worked as the head of policy at Coinbase from September 2014 to January 2016.  Before that, he served as a senior staffer for the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and worked on the first congressional inquiry and hearing into crypto and blockchain in 2013.  The lobbying efforts come at a time when Facebook is getting pressure from U.S. lawmakers over its plan to launch a global cryptocurrency as a payment method.  Just on Sunday, the U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), who also heads the House Financial Services Committee, said her meetings with regulators in Switzerland, where Facebook's Libra Association is headquartered, did not clear her doubts over the social media's crypto plan.  Waters notably called for a ""moratorium"" on the Libra development days after Facebook officially announced the move in June.  This is not the first time that Facebook hires lobbyists and third-party lobbying firms to work on blockchain-related policy.  Politico reported last month Facebook had spent over $7.5 million this year on lobbying efforts for Libra with third-party lobbying firms including Sternhell Group and the Cypress Group and the law firm Davis Polk.  The database compiled by ProPublica further shows Facebook has also signed up the lobbying firm Off Hill Strategies and the law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner around June and July to focus on ""issues related to blockchain policy.""

42382599,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEQF,1566892816,Loom Launches 'CryptoZombies' Tutorial to Get Coders on Facebook's Libra,"Want to learn how to work with Facebook's Libra blockchain? Do it with zombies.  The team at Loom is releasing a new, free CryptoZombies course. It's designed so that anyone can learn the basics of working with the Libra codebase that Facebook has already released.  Facebook announced in June its plan to create a new global stablecoin along with dozens of partners from major companies.  ""We went to a Libra meetup in Bangkok and 100 developers came out and none of them were blockchain people,"" Loom CEO Matthew Campbell told CoinDesk, adding:  ""We really think this is the project that will bring a lot more normal developers into the blockchain space.""  As an Asia-based company, Campbell and his colleagues have watched WeChat and Alipay come to dominate digital payments. As such, Campbell thinks there is ""going to be an equivalently large wave"" in the West, adding that he suspects mobile payments are viewed as a make-or-break feature within Facebook.  While the CryptoZombies Libra tutorial isn't the first place to learn about developing on the new blockchain, it does have the advantage of being online and free.  What to expect  Loom is a company that's focused on enhancing the blockchain developer experience, particularly in the gaming space.  The company's theory is that games will lead users into crypto, and in turn, Loom uses games to lead online students through lessons in coding.  ""We're going to have you make a little game, and you're going to have a little payment system in the game,"" Campbell said.  Receiving and sending payments is the primary part of what Facebook subsidiary Calibra has put out for Libra's codebase so far. Users running Libra on a testnet can also create tokens. The virtual machine, however, is not ready yet. So there's a fair amount that users can do, but a lot they still can't.  Like Loom's CryptoZombies program for ethereum (which has been used by thousands of developers), the company plans to release more units as more Libra code comes out.  Participants who sign up now can expect to learn about these early functions and get the basics of Facebook's new programming language, Move.  Campbell said that each chapter usually requires writing about 15 or fewer lines of code. The learning modules are meant to make be easy-to-digest.  Why Loom built it  ""For us, we're all about developer onboarding,"" Campbell told CoinDesk. ""The Loom chain is all about interoperability. We already support four chains. We see Libra as just another chain we're going to support.""  Loom is a Layer 2 solution that allows developers to evade scalability issues or bottlenecks on base-layer blockchains by offloading operations to its own delegated proof-of-stake chain. Its validators stake the loom token to participate in its consensus model and the company is working now to take that token from ERC-20 only to a multichain token, on chains like Binance and, hopefully, Libra.  ""We'll teach a bunch of people how to use Libra and they'll be aware of Loom and want to use our platform in conjunction with Libra,"" Campbell said.  Campbell said that as long as Libra gets built so that it supports multi-signatures where only a portion of the validators have to sign for a transaction to be valid, Loom will be able to run its token on Libra.  Despite skepticism  about Facebook's efforts to date, Campbell is eager to see what happens when Libra gets into the wild. He said:  ""This isn't the crypto we wanted, but it's going to get everybody started. I think it's going to be the gateway drug that we needed to get people into other cryptos.""

42382593,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sEIh,1566878426,Beyond USD: The Next Frontier for Stablecoins,"George Harrap is CEO and co-founder of Hong Kong based Bitspark, a bankless money transfer ecosystem focused on Asia and Africa.  This essay is presented as a part of No Closing Bell, a series leading up to Invest: Asia 2019 focused on how the Asian crypto markets are interacting with and impacting global investors. To keep the conversation going in person, register for Invest: Asia 2019 coming up in Singapore on Sept. 11-12.      Stablecoins are prevalent at all levels of crypto transactions these days, from the largest spot markets on exchanges like Binance to the trading pair of choice by many Hong Kong and mainland China OTC desks. The reason for the demand is simple: stablecoins provide a bridge between the fiat and crypto worlds.  However, not all stablecoins are the same. From currency peg to counterparty risk, there are two competing models duking it out at the moment: trusted and trustless stablecoins, with each referring to different levels of counterparty collateral risk.  We prefer trustless stablecoins as that model eliminates the counterparty risk of needing to trust a company, auditor, bank and humans in general.  The top 5 stablecoins in the market are all pegged to the US dollar and while USD is a reserve currency, that market is quite saturated already. In contrast, the opportunity in the other 180 fiat national currencies used by the majority of the world has barely been realised. That’s where the next frontier for stablecoins is.  In operating Bitspark in many emerging markets we have heard first hand from individuals, NGOs and companies how bank collapses are somewhat common and trust in government and banking is rock bottom. Access to digital cash that’s publicly visible and under the ownership of the individual would eliminate these problems and this is what Bitspark has been pioneering with PHP, IDR, VND pegged stablecoins for our remote money exchange agents.  Unique trading opportunities  There are interesting trading opportunities here too. Exotic currencies around the world almost always depreciate against the US dollar with recent examples found in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey, Zimbabwe and Iran.  A good trade here would be to short those currencies via placing a dollar stablecoin as collateral to back the issuance of these currencies and then selling them for dollars. Bitcoin traders, merchants, and individuals need to use these currencies everyday anyway, so there is a market of buyers to which issuers can sell to.  Over time as the issued currency depreciates, the collateral value backing it becomes more valuable relative to the issued currency, enabling the issuer to withdraw or exchange excess collateral. Having already sold their issued coins on Day 1, they have effectively shorted the exotic currency without having to deal with any questionable local custodian - that’s almost impossible to do within traditional financial services  At Bitspark, we are creating trustless stablecoins for every currency in the world having recently launched an exciting product with Stable.PHP, a stablecoin pegged to the Philippine Peso backed by BitUSD (the first and oldest stablecoin in existence) using the Bitshares protocol.  I will be discussing more about some of the trading opportunities in taking short positions on Stable.PHP at this year’s Invest.Asia conference in Singapore. For example, when your collateral is BitUSD and you are issuing an exotic currency like Stable.PHP, you can take a leveraged position long or short.  Our set of exotic stablecoins will only be expanding through the year enabling more people to access a digital financial system in their local currency.
