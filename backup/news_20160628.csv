42399087,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNg5,1467147629,New Vulnerability May Prevent Ethereum Soft Fork,"The number of options available to the ethereum development community as it searches for a way to recover investor funds lost when The DAO was compromised is dwindling with news that a vulnerability in one of the more prominent solutions has been discovered.  As it turns out, a soft fork that would have sought to blacklist the ether address that holds the confiscated funds, preventing it from conducting any transactions, actually exposes a previously undetected attack vector.  In a post on the Ethereum Foundation blog, developer Felix Lange explains that the exploit would slow down mining and prevent the completion of legitimate transactions.  Lange wrote:  ""Available options are being considered. The community can avoid any negative consequences of the soft fork by voting against it until a better solution has been found.""  Launched earlier this year, The DAO was the first large-scale distributed autonomous organization (DAO) designed with a leaderless governance structure and with the intent to distribute ether donated by contributors to new ethereum projects.  After raising more than $150m worth of ether, a flaw in the software was exploited, letting a malicious member move a portion of the funds into another DAO under their control.  Due to the way The DAO was coded, it is widely believed that the siphoned funds won’t be accessible to the perpetrator until 14th July. But in Lange’s post today, he added that ""there is no immediate urgency to block transactions while further proposals are being worked out"".  The development comes as ethereum miners, or those validating transactions and competing to create blocks on the platform, have until this Thursday to vote for the soft fork patch, thus implementing the soft fork.  The fork in the road  While Lange proposed two temporary workarounds to the vulernabilty, lead distributed application developer at ethereum, Fabian Vogelsteller, was less optimistic on Twitter.  Vogelsteller wrote:  ""With the soft fork being vulnerable there are two options left: a hardfork only affecting The DAOs, or doing nothing.""  The hard fork option, which would essentially roll back the ethereum blockchain to erase the transactions, has been controversial to some members of the community who worry it might undermine future faith in the reliability of the network.  Doing nothing has also been controversial, as it would give the person who used The DAO’s code to move funds to a separate account the ability to profit at the expense of the 23,000 token-holding members of the organization.

42399091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNl0,1467138665,The Inventor of the Merkle Tree Wants DAOs to Rule the World,"The inventor of the cryptographic tool at the heart of all blockchain technology has spent the last decade or so working in the fields of quantum computers and molecular printing to make technology that can fight disease and prolong human life.  Ralph Merkle and his peers in the field of nanotechnology are exploring ways to use viruses and other techniques to build microscopically tiny machines capable of assembling molecules at the atomic level, a process called molecular manufacturing.  In this nascent industry, machines that exist at this tiny scale could theoretically be used to assemble molecules atom by atom with potential applications that include affordable quantum computers, new forms of storing energy and semi-automated medical treatments from tiny implanted machines.  But as Merkle's work has progressed, the winner of the 1998 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology for theory began to worry that the end result his endeavors might also prove to be an existential threat to humanity.  ""As we move forward we find that technology is enhancing the ability of smaller and smaller groups to do more and more damage,"" Merkle said in a new interview.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Given that that is the case, we have to pay greater attention to dealing with the governance issues that surround coping with those kinds of change.""  Coming full circle  In his search for a new form of governance capable of adequately protecting the world, Merkle found himself right back where he started. The ability to reinvent governance could be locked in the very technology his eponymous Merkle's trees helped empower.  Merkle Trees, or certified digital signatures as the inventor called them in his original 1979 paper, allow for the cheap and reliable encryption of data by converting, or hashing, blocks of information into long strands of unique code.  The newest blocks of information, or leaves, are strung together to form what are called branches, which track down to a single string of numbers and letters called a Merkle Root containing all the previous information. This method of hashing blocks of information is at the core of both the bitcoin blockchain and the ethereum blockchain.  Then, in May 2014, Merkle joined the ethereum project as an adviser, and three months later, the inventor’s attention was drawn to a paper published by another inventor, the author of the original ethereum code, Vitalik Buterin, which discussed how distributed autonomous organizations, or DAOs, might codify various forms of governance into software.  Because DAOs are designed to operate without a leader, the software on which they are based relies on a series of smart contracts that form their method of governance.  Though Buterin’s article, entitled ""An Introduction to Futarchy"", touches on several alternative forms of governance that might one day power a DAO, at its core is the concept of Futarchy, invented in 2000 by Robin Hanson, a George Mason University researcher and chief scientist of Consensus Point, a markets research firm.  Buterin reasoned that Futarchy’s form of governance could eventually lead to a new kind of leadership where governance was controlled by increasingly accurate probabilities derived from what are called prediction markets, designed to determine the likelihood that an event will occur and be free from reliance on any single leader.  Betting on prediction markets  The key difference between a prediction market and an opinion poll, a general election, or the vote of a board of directors is that instead of asking participants what they want to happen, the questions center around what they think will happen.  Participants then express their prediction by buying shares ranging from $0.01 to $1.00 on sites like the Iowa Electronic Markets, with the value spent corresponding to the percentage certainly the participant has that an event will occur.  If they are right, they are paid out accordingly.  Because prediction markets give experts in a field an opportunity to profit on their research and knowledge, they are increasingly seen as more accurate than polls, according to one recent study, by as much as 74 percent.  Merkle said:  ""As I realized the extent to which DAOs could mediate a trusted infrastructure and the extent to which trust is lacking, I think, in many of the existing institutional frameworks, I began to wonder if there was some way of capitalizing on this to build a governmental structure or an organizational structure that would be trusted.""  DAO, democracy and governance  So in May 2016 Merkle published on his site a paper called ""DAOs, Democracy, and Governance"", a 27-page manifesto including a detailed description of how prediction markets could be used to determine membership of a nation, calculate the collective welfare of its citizens, replace governmental bodies such as the US congress, pass a bill, elect a president and prevent war.  Merkle argues that the citizens of a DAO democracy would adopt any “pragmatic” solution that minimized the loss of life. While his theory certainly applies to wars, it extends to any conflict.  ""For the most part,"" Merkle said. ""people don’t fight wars if they know what the outcome is going to be or if they reasonably can anticipate the outcome. They instead negotiate as good a deal as they can get.""  According to Merkle’s paper, the first DAO prototype is actually bitcoin itself, which is decentralized, autonomous, and somewhat organized, if the recent block size debate can be excused.  And after being run 24 hours a day, seven days a week for seven years, and accumulating a market cap of $10bn, it could be considered a successful experiment by most standards.  Overcoming critics  But DAOs and prediction markets are far from without detractors.  The first large-scale DAO, called simply The DAO, has been depleted of a large portion of what was once over $150m worth of resources after an unidentified person or group figured out how to manipulate parts of its own governance model.  At least 10 other possible exploits of that particular software are currently being discussed before a DAO 2.0 might be released.  Over the years, multiple well thought-out critiques of Futarchy have been published, largely focused on the diverse ways such a market-based implementation could be gamed to result in decisions that were destructive to the majority, but benefited an individual or small group.  To Merkle though, a fundamental component of a DAO democracy is that it has to have the ability to automatically improve its core software. He envisions an ecosystem of DAOs engaged in a Darwinistic form of competition resulting in genetic improvements to the way they operate.  Before a true DAO democracy could be implemented, Merkle says its citizens will need to become comfortable with the ideas of prediction markets, decentralized autonomous organizations and cryptocurrency. Then, a small-scale use case will need to be discovered.  Specifically, he argues that student organizations or other small groups would make for a good testing ground of the concept.  Once more is learned about how a DAO democracy might operate, the next logical place to expand are “bankrupt cities or lawless states, where really they don’t have a whole lot to lose by trying something that might or might not work,” he said. ""But if it does work, maybe they can bail themselves out of some difficulty.""  Implementation  Last week, Merkle addressed members of the Decentralized Autonomous Society in Palo Alto, California, to discuss his paper, the current state of ethereum and blockchain generally speaking.  For now, much of the progress being made in the field isn’t coming from the political side of governance, but from the governed — in particular, computers scientists, says Merkle.  That’s because cryptographic skills and other technological knowledge is essential to understanding where possible paths forward might lie.  But as the theory is explained and more use cases are achieved, the next step will be politicians working side-by-side with blockchain scientists, he said.  Merkle concludes:  ""I would expect those who are more classically trained in the realities of the political system, will be very interested in how to use these new tools and that in fact the best route forward is to get both the technical people and the application people who have been enmeshed in the political system for many decades to work together and integrate their ideas to produce the best solution.""

Clinton, who is expected to receive the presidential nomination from the US Democratic Party next month, released a broad technology and innovation agendahttps://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/ yesterday in which her campaign argued that US public policy should include work with blockchain.  The Clinton campaign stated:  ""We must position American innovators to lead the world in the next generation of technology revolutions – from autonomous vehicles to machine learning to public service blockchain applications – and we must defend universal access to the global, digital marketplace of ideas.""  The Clinton campaign also indicated that the presumptive Democratic nominee will, if elected, push for reduced regulatory barriers for startups and entrepreneurs.  ""Hillary will challenge state and local governments to identify, review and reform legal and regulatory obligations that protect legacy incumbents against new innovators,"" the campaign said.  The comments make Clinton the latest major US political candidate to offer support for blockchain technology and its surrounding industry.  In April 2015, then-Republican presidential candidate Rand Paul announced he would accept bitcoin as payment for donations, a decision that was soon followed by former Texas Governor and presidential hopeful Rick Perry.

Headquartered in the SoHo offices of Galvanize, the workspace is the latest of IBM’s Bluemix Garages, physical workshopping destinations that provide a venue for its technology consulting services.  The opening comes amid a broad push by the company to expand its expertise in the blockchain industry.  Earlier this month, IBM announced the massive Watson Centre at Marina Boy in Singapore. Designed to house 5,000 computer scientists in the Asian-Pacific region, the location also included a new IBM Garage.  Then, just last week IBM announced that Mizuho Financial had successfully tested a digital currency-based blockchain settlement system created at the newly opened IBM Garage in Tokyo.  Blockchains in the cloud  These Garages, and others located in San Francisco, London, Toronto and Nice, are also part of an industry-wide competition for cloud computing providers to capitalize on interest in blockchain.  For example, last month, Amazon Cloud Services announced that it would begin working to offer a blockchain experimentation environment for enterprises. Further, in March, Microsoft’s cloud computing service, added five blockchain startups to its blockchain-as-service platform.

42399077,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNWF,1467086425,Kraken Acquires Dutch Bitcoin Exchange CleverCoin,"San Francisco-based digital currency exchange Kraken is making yet another acquisition, scooping up Dutch exchange CleverCoin.  The deal is Kraken’s second acquisition of 2016, coming just over five months after it purchased New York-based Coinsetter, which had acquired Canadian bitcoin exchange CAVirtex the year before.  The integration of CleverCoin’s services and its customer base into Kraken’s platform is set to take place this Wednesday on 29th June. The terms of the deal were not disclosed.  While Kraken is acquiring the assets and customer base of CleverCoin, the team behind the exchange isn't carrying over to the new owners.  When reached for comment, CleverCoin CEO Karsten Nilsen said that he and co-founder Christian de Kok wouldn't be joining Kraken as part of the deal, and will move on to another business focused on enterprise IT.  Founded in early 2014, CleverCoin spent that year expanding its services to move past its initial market in The Netherlands, looking to capture greater market share in Europe.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said that the deal was buoyed by what he described as a brightening outlook for digital currencies, pointing to recent price increases and clarification on regulatory questions as key drivers.  He said in a statement:  ""The acquisition of CleverCoin will empower Kraken with greater liquidity and a significantly expanded customer base in Europe, our flagship market.""  Blog posts on CleverCoin’s website suggest that the acquisition was motivated, at least in part, by past issues with a payment processor they were using.  On 15th April, the exchange announced that it had stopped processing orders, and later that month it was still working on the problem. Earlier this month, the company said that it had “found a solution” and would make further details known on 28th June – the date of today’s announcement.  Nilsen referenced the processor issues in an email to CoinDesk, while also highlighting the existing relationship between the two exchanges.  ""We have known the Kraken team since being at [startup accelerator] Boost VC, lately we lost one of the biggest payment providers we were working with and we started talking and managed to come up with a great deal together,"" he told CoinDesk.

42399082,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiNbA,1467082681,Multiple Bidders Claim $16 Million in Australian Bitcoin Auction,"Ernst & Young revealed today that multiple bidders claimed 24,518 BTC (worth roughly $16m at press time) as part of a scheduled bitcoin auction that began on 20th June and ended on 21st June.  E&Y, the professional services firm that oversaw the sale, did not disclose the price paid by bidders or the number of bidders involved, though it said participants had been notified of auction outcomes.  However, given that the funds were held in a publicly available bitcoin wallet, analysis indicates that as many as three to four winners were awarded funds in the sale. (The bitcoin wallet holding the funds was first identified by bitcoin user Adam Meister on YouTube).  Data from blockchain data provider Skry shows unknown winners claimed 13,999 BTC ($9.25m), 6,517 BTC ($4.27m) and 1,999.99 BTC ($1.31m), with the largest winner claiming seven 2,000 BTC blocks as part of the auction.  At press time, at least one transaction block was unaccounted for in the transactions, with 1,999 BTC still unspent in the original wallet.  In statements, E&Y transactions partner Adam Nikitins said that the auction drew “significant interest” from participants including bitcoin exchanges, digital asset investment funds and high net worth individuals.  Nitkins said:  ""The process was very competitive and demonstrates the growing appetite for digital assets such as bitcoin.""  Prior to the auction, participants indicated a willingness to enter the bidding process due to what they said has been the recent scarcity of bitcoin sellers given the sharp increases in the digital currency's price in the weeks leading up to the event.  As previously reported, the funds were originally confiscated by the Australian government in connection with the prosecution of a Silk Road user who plead guilty to commercial drug trafficking in 2014.
