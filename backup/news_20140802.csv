42397810,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHeh,1406997924,Can Bitcoin Deliver on its Promise to the World's Unbanked?,"Jason Tyra is a Certified Public Accountant and ACFE Certified Fraud Examiner. In this article, he evaluates the potential benefits bitcoin offers for the world's impoverished and unbanked, and outlines what needs to be done to give this underserved population access to its ground-breaking technology.  While many relatively affluent westerners have adopted bitcoin as a political statement, a cost-saving measure or a technical curiosity, a very small portion of its users have done so as a result of the demands of their own political or socioeconomic circumstances.  However, for those that potentially stand to gain the most from the digital currency – impoverished and unbanked people living in developing regions of the world – bitcoin remains largely inaccessible.  An objective look at a few of bitcoin’s characteristics and how these apply to developing countries shows that the ecosystem has some room for improvement before it can gain traction among the world’s poor. By pointing out some of these limitations, I hope to help spur development of innovative solutions to mitigate them.  A refuge from insecurity  Bitcoin is a good option for storing wealth where governments and/or banks are untrustworthy, restrictive, or unavailable. Here I mean untrustworthy in the most literal sense.  In spite of the lack of social justice decried by some bitcoiners, rule of law and sanctity of private property are still reliable assumptions in the United States and most other western countries. The vast majority of people living in developed countries don’t fall asleep at night wondering whether their bank will be nationalized overnight or their house seized by the state.  Wealth held in bitcoins can be securely stored free of transaction fees for an indefinite period. Bitcoins cannot easily be expropriated by the state, or limited in any meaningful way in their movement between jurisdictions by capital controls. They cannot be devalued over time by inflationary monetary policies.  Banking hurdles  Starting with the question of why people lack bank accounts in the first place, bitcoin isn’t necessarily helpful. A World Bank report in 2012 cited cost, distance to a banking facility and bureaucratic hurdles as reasons that more than 2.5 billion of the world’s poor lack a bank account.  Among these, cost may be bitcoin’s sole weak point, but it’s a significant one. Cost is not only a measure of the fees charged by banks for the privilege of maintaining an account, but also one of opportunity to consume.  Unless you are a miner, the only way to get bitcoins is to receive them in payment or purchase them with fiat currency. Purchasing with fiat currency usually requires a bank account or at least some way to send money internationally. Having a bank account means that you have official identification (a bureaucratic hurdle) and also that you have been able to defer consumption long enough to have money that you don’t need to spend right away.  The same would be true for wealth 'stored' in bitcoin. This can be extremely difficult for people living hand to mouth.  On the subject of mining, the amount of computing power and electricity now required to mine bitcoins places this activity well out of reach of all but the wealthiest enthusiasts. For a citizen of the developing world, mining diamonds or gold is likely to be far easier than mining bitcoins.  Choke points  It is worth pointing out here that remittances are a major source of cash-flow for families in developing countries who have relatives living in the US or other more developed nations. Bitcoin has a niche use here for very low-cost transfers, provided the recipient has a way to spend bitcoins or convert them to fiat.  [post-quote]  Most of bitcoin’s users will eventually need to convert to fiat currency to pay taxes or shop in places that don’t accept cryptocurrency.  In the United States, doing this kind of business with reputable vendors typically requires a bank account, while purchases may also require a credit card. If you don’t have a bank account and credit card in the US, then you are out of luck.  In other countries, street-level money changers may be capable of meeting this demand up to a point. However, money changing and currency speculation are illegal for private citizens in many countries without a license (or at all). Incidentally, these are the countries where bitcoin is likely to be attractive due to oppressive governments.  The features of bitcoin that empower users to 'be their own bank' also place it out of reach of vast swaths of humanity.  Today, you must have one of two things to use bitcoin: a computer with an Internet connection that is powerful enough to handle direct interaction with the block chain or the ability to access a third-party servicer (eg: using your own computer, using a public computer, such as at an Internet cafe or library or using a web-enabled cellphone).  Micro-lending and SMS  Bitcoin is perfect for the kind of small-scale entrepreneurship that is advocated by micro lenders (Kiva being a good example) and not-for-profit organizations in impoverished areas.  In essence, small loans or grants may be used to purchase a motorbike, cellphone, livestock, and so on. These items, in turn, are used as capital for small businesses, the profits of which are used to repay the loan. Bitcoin is an extremely cheap and low risk way for nascent entrepreneurs to accept payment, but only when the purchaser and seller both have Internet enabled smartphones running bitcoin software.  According to a survey of 24 developing countries conducted by the Pew Research Center, even where Internet service is available, smartphones are still relatively rare and many of the world’s poor access the Internet using public computers.  Cellphones are commonly used to make payments in these countries, especially using services like M-Pesa, but such services normally use SMS functionality rather than a sophisticated app. While, some startups are now offering services that can allow people to send and receive bitcoin via text, they still have some way to go before being commonly used.  Realistic solutions needed  So, right now, if you have no way to get online, then you have very limited ways to send or receive bitcoin. And, if you don’t have a bank account, then bitcoin is unlikely to be an effective solution to your problem, since bitcoin itself requires a bank account for most users to transact business effectively over long periods of time.  For all of their positive features, cryptocurrencies are mostly inaccessible to the developing world for now. Changing this will require bitcoiners to develop robust and realistic solutions that will put it into the hands of the people who need it most.  Have some ideas of your own?

42397815,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHid,1406984424,"Bitcoin in the Philippines, By the Numbers","Luis Buenaventura is the Head of Product at Satoshi Citadel Industries, and ""dreams of a world where everyone has access to everything"".    Satoshi Citadel Industries calls itself a “provider of bitcoin solutions” and manages a range of different digital currency services and sites, including Bitmarket, in-beta exchange Coinage, photo-sharing site Bitstars.ph, and remittance service ReBit. SCI is also rolling out pre-loaded bitcoin cards as another fast way to get bitcoin into newcomers’ wallets.    In many ways, the Philippines is probably the perfect environment for the kind of decentralised revolution that bitcoin has the potential to enable.  It has some of the warmest, kindest, most open people in the world, surrounded with all the hallmarks of the developing world – suffocating pollution, tremendous traffic jams, institutional corruption on all levels, poverty on an unreal scale.  Poverty and remittance  About 90% of our population lives on $10 or less per household per day, a statistic which is most staggering when you consider that the international definition of 'extreme poverty' is $2 a day per person.  Not surprisingly, there are about 10 million Filipinos living and working outside the Philippines – so many in the fact that their collective cash remittances account for about 10% ($30bn) of the country’s GDP.  The average Filipino will send $200 home every month, from which international remitters will charge anywhere from 4% to 10% per transaction.  One could say that the bitcoin solution practically writes itself here. Indeed, a handful of young crypto-based services are currently working to drive that figure down to just 1%, potentially upending an industry that has been gouging the market for decades.  Boosting e-commerce  E-commerce has only just started to make inroads here over the past five years, as the number of Internet-connected devices has increased. Smartphone penetration is now at 40%, far outstripping desktops and laptops, which have long languished at about 10%.  The problem is, the majority of online sales in the Philippines are decidedly still offline in their fulfillment. Buyers either agree to meet the sellers at a physical location (a food court, maybe, or a train station), or they make a cash deposit at the seller’s bank and then wait for next-day delivery. This is because only 5% of Filipinos have access to credit cards.  Applying for your average Visa or MasterCard requires background checks and plenty of paperwork, and even then the incidence of fraud and chargebacks are still inordinately high. Again, the alternative that bitcoin presents here is a no-brainer – it’s trustless, irreversible and has close to zero setup time. Furthermore, and importantly, no one needs permission or ID checks to use it.  Digital money is still money  Via our company Bitstars, we created a bitcoin-powered daily selfie contest with small daily cash prizes. Initially, due to budgetary restrictions, they were $5-$10 in BTC for each day’s most popular selfie, but as time went on, that limitation became a very strong audience filter.  To put it bluntly, the only users who competed for $5 were those who could really use $5. They weren't taking part because they believed in bitcoin as a technology or revolutionary movement – to them, it’s not that bitcoin is better money, it’s that it is money, full stop.  There were never any philosophical arguments with our users about whether bitcoin was a valid currency or why decentralised systems are better. All that mattered was that it looked like money, and we were letting them have some of it.  The bottom line is that bitcoin represents money that 90 million low-income Filipinos could use in areas and situations where the traditional systems have otherwise failed them. They could start sending and accepting bitcoin immediately with just their mobile phones, with no upfront costs, and without having to ask for permission from anyone.  Turbocharging finance  Bitcoin turbocharges a set of financial enablers that these socio-economic tiers have never had access to.  Imagine 150 people from all over the world chipping in a dollar each to put an underprivileged child through school for a year. Or 50 people putting together $20 to help an aspiring street vendor buy enough goods to start an ad hoc business.  Micro-lending on this scale has never been possible before due to transmission costs, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  The Philippines is one of the few places in the world where you can buy eight individual sheets of paper, four teaspoons of vinegar, or a single cigarette (in USD, those would all cost less than 10 cents).  Fiat currencies often have a hard time supporting the granularity that entrepreneurship at this level requires, but bitcoin is divisible to an almost infinite degree.  Speculating  It’s difficult to speculate what kind of effect cryptocurrency will eventually have on the population of the Philippines over the next few years. What’s certain is that it already provides us with the tools necessary to make some big changes on all levels of the socio-economic strata.  It will all start with education and distribution. We need to get bitcoin into the hands of as many people as possible, and then support the ideas that naturally come about as a result of diverse adoption. In that respect, at least, bitcoin is exactly like any other nascent technology: it’s all about the numbers.

42397847,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEHpW,1406975431,The Promise and Pitfalls of Crypto Crowdfunding,"CoinSummit London saw a number of notable speakers, panels and announcements during its two-day run this July, but those issued by Swarm, a crowdfunding platform that seeks to use cryptocurrency to empower industry businesses, may have passed under the radar.  During a party to celebrate its efforts, Swarm announced campaigns for several initiatives, including an effort called SpaceBit that seeks to send remote-controlled satellites into orbit, and a kale farming collective that is raising cryptocurrency to grow its health-conscious snack business.  Both projects highlight how cryptocurrency provides a new way for investors to support interesting projects. Swarm has even raised capital through its own platform – it has crowdsourced $1m in funding from a distributed group of backers.  Swarm further highlights an interesting discrepancy in the bitcoin ecosystem. While some startups like IT security specialist CrowdCurity raise part of their funding in bitcoin, most major bitcoin businesses still receive fiat currency from venture capitalists and investment firms.  With the introduction of Swarm and other similar platforms, those looking to raise money without forging connections with Silicon Valley's tech elite certainly have a new avenue to obtain capital. The question is how this new and untested market will mature while responding to concerns that need to be addressed through regulation.  New need for crowdfunding  One of the primary reasons behind the rising interest in crowdfunding is that as the price of bitcoin and other altcoins becomes increasingly stable, entrepreneurs can no longer steadily rely on the increasing value of these assets to fund their ideas.  For example, the 2013 rise in the price of bitcoin and other alternative cryprocurrencies such as litecoin allowed savvy investors in the bitcoin community new economic freedoms.  According to CoinDesk’s historical pricing data, investors could have realized over an 80x return on investment had they played the bitcoin market right.  This increase in price also means that new businesses could be formed and developed without outside investment.  Issues arise  One of the most notable examples of cryptocurrency crowdfunding and its current issues was provided this year by decentralized platform provider MaidSafe, which raised money via cryptocurrency, converting bitcoin into a token called MaidSafeCoin.  The affair was not as smooth as organizers had hoped, an account that was covered in depth by Forbes.  In essence, many of the coins that MaidSafe ended up with were mastercoins, an altcoin that has be criticized as illiquid. According to Coinmarketcap, recent 24-hour volume for mastercoin was around $1,500, which would make any quantity of it difficult to sell on the open market.  Jeremy Lam, co-founder of Vennd, offers a solution for what happened with the MaidSafe fund raiser. He said that the manual process of doling out digital shares of MaidSafeCoin is what caused problems:  ""The incentive rate was much greater than the current market value for an illiquid asset [mastercoin]. Second, demand outstripped what was intended. When you have to process these things manually, it just becomes an impossible task entirely.""  An automated solution  Lam's Vennd project automates the distribution of digital assets purchased with cryptocurrencies.  Used by Swarm, Lam likes to think of his project like a vending machine: people send cryptocurrency to a Vennd instance, and its code tracks digital asset inventory. When a project runs out of a set number of digital assets, Vennd automatically starts refunding those who didn't get a share of a particular crowdfunding effort.  Unlike other crowdfunding efforts, the Swarm platform also claims it allows investors to have voting rights with the digital tokens that it dispenses through Vennd.  Joel Dietz, the founder of Swarm, told CoinDesk:  ""Real cryptoequity [like Swarm] allows you to do things, like vote on a project, that you could never do before.""  Dietz says Swarm tokens are a ""programmable set of rights"", allowing project investors a real say.  Lam offered a different take, saying that the Counterparty-based decentralized tokens that Swarm disburses for its projects are tangible instruments. This could include a share of profits or debt issuance. However, one risk with crowdfunding is that the collecting party may not use the money it raises for the express purposes detailed during fundraising.  ""The tokens are worth as much as the issuer puts into them, strangely enough,"" Lam said. ""Obviously, there is a trust factor there.""  The appcoin alternative  Still, with any cryptocurrency crowdfunding opportunity, there remains the possibility that the issuers of the assets may default.  Swarm is not the only project seeking to tackle this cryptocurrency crowdfunding challenge. VC firm Andreessen Horowitz is looking into the concept of funding startup development with distributed coins.  Mentioned at Coinsummit San Francisco in March by Andreessen Horowitz’s Balaji Srinivasan and further outlined on AngelList founder Naval Ravikant’s blog, the firm has an idea to develop “appcoins"" that would fund operational and technical development.  This type of coin would be pre-allocated for distributed ventures, which would then disburse appcoins as a scarce resource in return for contributions such as code development.  However, Ravikant told CoinDesk that the idea has not passed the conceptual stage. He called appcoin an “idle hypothesis that has yet to materialize”. Yet, the fact that major Silicon Valley venture capitalists are openly talking about appcoin gives it some validity.  The idea of an appcoin is not without its critics, however, as the topic broaches the sensitive topic of how assets are pre-allocated by cryptocurrency projects. In the altcoin world, where the development team commonly keeps a certain share of the initial coin offering, this process is known as premining.  A contentious subject, premining of any sort has caused a number of altcoins an early demise, as investors may believe that the only purpose of premining is to enrich the original creator of an asset.  Nevertheless, Ravikant believes that when it comes to application or other sorts of technology-related development, premining shouldn’t be an issue:  “I'm not sure most users of an app would care, especially if it's an early mine rather than pre-mine, kept small, and explicitly used to compensate the OSS developers and to pay future bug bounties / development.”  US crowdfunding concerns  Yet another unsolved concern is the fiduciary duty that crowfunders might take on when raising money with cryptocurrency in bitcoin's biggest market to date: the US.  The state of Washington, for example, has decided to take companies to task for failing to provide a return on investment for investors who participate in crowdfunding campaigns.  That state passed a bill allowing equity crowdfunding back in March. But, it is stepping up its enforcement of crowdfunding projects that don't provide meaningful recompense. In May, the Wasahington State Attorney General filed charges against a Kickstarter-funded game that produced no return for at least 31 Washington state-based investors.  In fact, the Washington State Department of Financial Institutions has offered up this warning in regards to crowdfunding:  ""When you see an offering on the Internet — whether it is on a crowdfunding portal, in an online newsletter, on a message board or in a chat room — you should assume it is a scam until you have done your homework and proven otherwise.""  Consumer involvement in such investments is still relatively low, but already regulators are issuing warnings – another example is an SEC alert that was put out just weeks after the MaidSafeCoin fundraising.  The future for crypto-crowdfunding  Cryptocurrency crowdfunding is a way to access funding without knowing accredited investors. However, it can be argued investors in these types of projects are unable to properly evaluate the risk associated with such investments.  In crowdfunding, that sort of criticality is not necessarily present. In fact, it seems traditional crowdfunding through sites like Kickstarter attract people who are looking to devote resources towards charitable causes, not necessarily business ventures.  Dietz, Swarm's founder, is aware of the regulatory issues that his effort presents, but he believes that with proper legal guidance, these issues can be mitigated.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Because regulations and compliance is such a gray area, we are looking very exhaustively for everything we are legally allowed to do and evaluating every regulation that is brought to our attention by our legal consul.""  AngelList's Ravikant seems fairly certain that there could be a divide in the future, with above-the-board crowdfunding sales and perhaps a ‘dark web’ of funding both proliferating. This could perhaps be done with alternative cryptocurrencies like the now-popular darkcoin or in certain localities.  Ravikant said:  “[Compliance is] a big one. This could easily be interpreted as selling securities, which might stifle innovation, drive it underground, or move it out of countries that apply securities regulations to it.”  Golden Piggybanks image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/02/the-promise-and-pitfalls-of-crypto-crowdfunding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e668911db09f4f19b1a0eaf9c02d02df46c559fc-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
