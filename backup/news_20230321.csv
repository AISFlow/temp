42421317,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpiX,1679442915,Looking at Some Unanswered Signature and Silvergate Bank Questions,"It seems the crypto industry still has some questions about Signature and Silvergate’s shutdowns. Plus, I’m in Washington, D.C., for a few days this week attending the DC Blockchain Summit on Tuesday and the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee meeting on Wednesday. Say hi if you’re there!  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Banking confusion  The narrative  We’ve still got some unanswered questions about the Signature and Silvergate bank shutdowns. What kinds of issues forced those shutdowns? Did Silvergate voluntarily repay its FHLB loans? Just how much money did Signature lose in deposits?  Why it matters  I think it’s safe to assume people want certainty. Companies want to know they'll be able to tap banking services. For that to happen, banks need to be comfortable serving crypto companies. And for that to happen, they probably need to know what factors led to Signature becoming a failed bank – was it, as so much of the industry keeps saying, the mere fact it served crypto clients? Or was it because the bank itself had some deeper issues?  Breaking it down  Things are pretty weird.  On Sunday, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation announced that Flagstar Bank, a subsidiary of New York Community Bancorp, would acquire the assets of Signature Bank – except for about $4 billion in crypto-related deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will dispose of those on its own (and in the meantime, the FDIC continues to operate Signature’s Signet system).  The news came days after Reuters reported the FDIC was telling potential bidders they would not be able to bid on the crypto parts of Signature’s business, a claim the FDIC denied.  This came days after my colleague Helene Braun reported the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco denied it forced Silvergate Bank to repay its loans, though FHLB declined to answer whether that meant it refused to roll its advance to Silvergate.  My colleague Jesse Hamilton also reported Monday that major banks aren’t rushing to fill the Signature/SIlvergate-shaped hole for crypto companies. A number of major banks have outright said they are not looking to provide services for the crypto industry, or at least not for companies that engage directly with tokens. Other banks are willing to work with companies that invest in companies that deal with crypto – they’re OK with crypto at a distance, basically.  Suffice to say, however, there seems to be more to the story behind Signature and Silvergate than we know at this moment. Both banks appeared to experience major outflows prior to their respective shutdowns. While we don’t have reliable figures for Silvergate at this time, we can compare Signature’s last reported figures with what the FDIC has shared.  On March 8, Signature reported it held over $89 billion in deposits, about $16.5 billion of which were tied to the crypto industry. As of March 19, the crypto deposit figure was down to $4 billion – suggesting that more than $12 billion in deposits from crypto companies left Signature in a very short period of time.  If other depositors followed suit, a good chunk of Signature’s deposits may have left after that March 8 press release. Barney Frank, the former congressman and current Signature Board member going around saying it was shuttered due to politics or crypto, said $10 billion left the bank on March 9.  We’re also still waiting on updated figures from between March 12, when the New York Department of Financial Services seized Signature, and March 19, when the FDIC approved Flagstar’s bid.  All this is to say we’re in a pretty weird spot in terms of guessing what the future may look like for crypto companies seeking banking services. It’s almost a throwback to years past, when crypto companies couldn’t secure reliable banking services on their own.

Is This a Crypto Banking Bailout?: Was last week’s actions by federal bank regulators and the U.S. Treasury Department to backstop deposits at failed banks a bailout?  SCOTUS takes up crypto (sorta)  By Cheyenne Ligon  The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in its first crypto-related case on Tuesday, when lawyers for San Francisco-based crypto exchange Coinbase will attempt to convince the nine Justices to pause a pair of class-action lawsuits against the crypto exchange.  Though the case the high court will hear Tuesday involves crypto, it is not itself a crypto case. Instead, this case is a fairly esoteric, procedural argument over whether a lawsuit can proceed in federal court while one party – in this case, Coinbase – is attempting to send the dispute to arbitration.  Coinbase is in the process of appealing an earlier decision by a federal court in California allowing the two lawsuits, Bielski v. Coinbase and Suski v. Coinbase, to continue, in contrast with Coinbase’s user agreement, which requires disputes to be sent to arbitration. Arbitration is an out-of-court method of dispute resolution in which the odds are often unfairly stacked against consumers.  Read more here.

The company projects itself to be a top 5 public miner by production capacity. If I can achieve production projections, I think it would be wise to adjust treasury strategy before the halving. Iris Energy ( IREN ) is a Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stock that I've covered previously on three different occasions: A Way To Play Bitcoin's Eventual Turnaround Execution and Production Look Strong Things Have Changed For a more in-depth look at my thoughts on Iris, I'd encourage reading each of those previous articles. Brief Summary Iris attempted an aggressive scaling of BTC production capacity last year and quickly grew from 0.9 EH/s in April to 3.9 EH/s by the end of October. The problem the company ran into was the scaling attempt essentially came at the worst possible time as BTC's price fell dramatically following the collapses of Terra Luna ( LUNC-USD ), Celsius ( CEL-USD ), and FTX ( FTT-USD ). What arguably made matters worse for many in the Bitcoin mining space was an increase in electricity costs that crushed mining profitability and pushed many over-levered miners into insolvency. While I think many would agree Iris did a better job managing its balance sheet than certain mining peers, the loss of machines that were collateralized through special purpose vehicles sort of put Iris back to square one and without any BTC in treasury due to the company's production liquidation strategy. With roughly a year remaining until the next Bitcoin halving, mining companies are running out of time to acquire as much BTC as possible before the block reward is chopped from 6 BTC down to 3. Iris Updates In February, Iris reported $13.8 million in earnings for the 2nd quarter of its 2023 fiscal year. This was a 15% quarter over quarter revenue decrease which the company attributed to declining Bitcoin prices and the decreased number of Bitcoin mined in the period. This was coupled with increases in electricity, site, and corporate costs that resulted in $17.7 million in negative operating income for the quarter: Operating Income (Seeking Alpha) Earlier this month Iris disclosed 156 BTC mined and 1.7 EH/s of operating capacity as of the February production update. Shortly after that February production update, Iris announced that the company has started installing additional machine deliveries that will ultimately take the company's operating exahash from 1.7 EH/s to 5.5 EH/s. The majority of which will be coming online shortly : 160MW of data center infrastructure (supporting ~4.9 EH/s) is available immediately, with commissioning of the first 20MW at Childress (supporting the remaining ~0.6 EH/s) expected in the coming months. If Iris is able to execute on bringing these machines online, it will make the company a top 5 public miner by monthly production capacity : Production Guidance (Iris Energy) Note, this slide does not include Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ) which still had the largest mining capacity as of February but is currently going through bankruptcy . Revenue Modeling Aside from energy costs, Bitcoin prices, and potential regulatory risk that comes from mining in jurisdictions that are unfriendly to crypto, the major headwind that is shared by all of these public miners is the block reward halving that is roughly a year away. If Iris can execute on scaling goals and achieve 5.5 EH/s in Q2, the company projects annualized revenue generation of $94 million at a $25k BTC price: Revenue Projection (Iris Energy) So far in 2023, Iris has generated 328 Bitcoin at an average EH/s of 1.6. At the company's current BTC per EH/s levels, 5.5 EH/s per second could generate a little under 568 BTC per month assuming global hash rate remains at levels similar to where they have been over the last two months. Global Bitcoin Hash Rate (CoinMetrics) This is not a sure thing however as I expect global hash rate will likely continue the broad trend higher. To estimate Iris' revenue at full 5.5 EH/s capacity requires an additional input; how much BTC Iris can mine per exahash. Over the course of the last 12 months, the company's BTC per EH/s has varied considerably but has generally been somewhere between 115 and 130. Given the current global hash rate trend and the increasing Bitcoin price possibly bringing more miners back online, I'd take a more cautious view when assessing BTC per EH/s expectations: Monthly Revenue from 5.5 EH/s BTC production Bitcoin Price BTC per EH/s $20,000 $25,000 $30,000 $35,000 $40,000 85 $9,350,000 $11,687,500 $14,025,000 $16,362,500 $18,700,000 90 $9,900,000 $12,375,000 $14,850,000 $17,325,000 $19,800,000 95 $10,450,000 $13,062,500 $15,675,000 $18,287,500 $20,900,000 100 $11,000,000 $13,750,000 $16,500,000 $19,250,000 $22,000,000 105 $11,550,000 $14,437,500 $17,325,000 $20,212,500 $23,100,000 110 $12,100,000 $15,125,000 $18,150,000 $21,175,000 $24,200,000 Source: author projections If we assign a base case of 90 EH/s at a $30k BTC price, Iris is looking at roughly $14.9 million in monthly revenue, or $44.6 million per quarter if the company continues to sell production. Measured in Bitcoin, this base case guess could generate 1,485 BTC per quarter if the company decides to pivot to a HODL strategy at any point before the halving. Main Takeaway Though Iris has been very clear about liquidating production to fund operations, at some point the company may want to re-examine that approach before the Bitcoin halving next year. When the block reward is cut, revenue from mining will drop off dramatically unless the price of BTC moves up considerably. If that happens, it would behoove companies like Iris Energy to have some BTC in treasury that it can sell post-halving. At current EH/s levels, it's unlikely that Iris will be able scale a HODL stack that compares to companies like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) or HIVE Blockchain ( HIVE ) should it choose to pivot its balance sheet management in anticipation of the halving. But even in the event that it doesn't pivot the treasury management strategy, Iris stock should benefit greatly from production expansion in the coming months if it can hit its timelines.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589157-iris-energy-winning-race-against-time?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10947497.jpeg
42393740,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA0L5,1679442037,"Hacker vs. Hacker: North Koreans Attempt to Phish Euler Exploiter of $200M in Crypto, Experts Say","Euler Finance’s efforts to recover nearly $200 million in stolen crypto hit yet another wrinkle Tuesday after a wallet linked to North Korean hackers tried to swindle the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol’s exploiter.  The so-called Ronin bridge exploiter, which last March stole $625 million worth from crypto game Axie Infinity, sent an on-chain note to Euler’s exploiter asking it to decrypt an encrypted message. But according to the experts CoinDesk spoke with, the message was a phishing scam attempting to steal the credentials for the Euler exploiter’s wallet.  The unlikely exchange from one crypto hacker to another spurred confusion on Crypto Twitter and rang alarm bells at Euler Finance, which was already days into its own on-chain effort to recover the $200 million. Euler is a platform for borrowing and lending cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain.  The Lazarus Group is a hacker group allegedly tied to North Korea. Observers have accused Lazarus of mounting a multibillion-dollar campaign against the crypto world, the proceeds of which are said to fund North Korea's weapons program.  Minutes after the Ronin hacker wallet messaged the Euler hacker wallet, developers at Euler Finance tried to intervene with messages of their own. They warned their own hacker to be wary of the purported decryption software, saying “the simplest way out here is to return funds.”  Euler developers continued in a separate transaction, “Do not try to view that message under any circumstance. Do not enter your private key anywhere. Reminder that your machine may be also compromised.”  Opinions  The Ronin hackers’ overtures may be a thinly veiled attempt to trick the Euler hacker into surrendering the private key – and thus the crypto – they stole from Euler Finance, said Hudson Jameson, a former developer at the Ethereum Foundation. But he said the motives behind the on-chain messages remain unclear.  “In my opinion, it is unknown why they are asking, but it definitely could be an attempt to see if the Euler hacker falls for a phishing attempt,"" Jameson told CoinDesk.  Stephen Tong, co-founder of security audit firm Zellic.io, speculated Ronin’s purported encrypted message may well contain an “offer” for the Euler hacker, “but we can't know for sure since we can't decrypt the message without the private key.”  The on-chain drama comes as Euler Finance tries to mount its own negotiation via messages encoded on the Ethereum blockchain. It was Euler Finance’s pleas for the return of $200 million that the hacker responded to Tuesday:  “We want to make this easy on all those affected. No intention of keeping what is not ours,” the hacker wrote back to Euler Finance, seemingly ignoring the Ronin exploiter’s attempted phish. The message continued: “will communicate shortly.”  Read more: Euler Finance to Offer $1M Reward as It Reels From Nearly $200M Exploit  The Ronin Bridge exploiter and the Euler Finance exploiter both did not immediately return a request for comment.  Tuesday’s messages weren’t the first time the two exploiters crossed paths. On March 17, the Euler Finance exploiter sent 100 ether (ETH) to wallets connected to the Lazarus Group’s Ronin heist. It was unclear why.  The messages highlight how Ethereum can be a platform for the unlikeliest of conversations, said Jameson.  “As opposed to centralized systems that maintain control of the messaging, the Euler exploiter provides an example of new age communications and processes in response to a public smart contract exploit.""",NEGATIVE,ETH,ASIA | AXS | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET,"Elizabeth Napolitano, Sage D.

Gox bear market. This pattern suggests Bitcoin has entered the next bull phase of its global monetary adoption process. According to this forecast, early-2023 is the third-best Bitcoin buying opportunity of all time. During the next 1.5 years, Bitcoin's price should accumulate with an upward bias, supported by the 30-week Simple Moving Average and the Power Law bands. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is in its most transformational period ever . The aggregate fundamental, technical, economic, and geopolitical dynamics suggest Bitcoin is beginning a new long-term uptrend. According to Bitcoin's past decade of cyclical price action, Bitcoin's current bull market began in November 2022 and is due to peak in early-2025. BTC:USD - 1W, Elliott waves, Power-Law bands, 30W-SMA, Technology Adoption stages (TradingView 3/16/2023) Therefore, future successful cryptocurrency investors should identify the winning protocols now . This article extrapolates global economic and technological trends to determine Bitcoin's long-term price targets. Bitcoin Is At An Inflection Point; 2023 = 2015 Bitcoin is a next-generation technology with intense growth potential. As indicated by Bitcoin's accelerating total wallet addresses , the adoption of Bitcoin's cryptographic verification technology is exponentially increasing . Bitcoin: Total Active Addresses (LookIntoBitcoin) Bitcoin's technical, on-chain, and cyclical charts are synergistically bullish. Most of the 50+ data visualization charts from LookIntoBitcoin suggest BTC is trending deeply bullish from long-term bottom support at $15,500. The Puell Multiple, Value Days Destroyed, RHODL ratio, MVRV Z-score, and Pi Cycle Top indicators suggest Bitcoin has two years of potential upside. Bitcoin: Value Days Destroyed (LookIntoBitcoin) Bitcoin's bullish price action and positive user growth metrics pair nicely with geopolitical headwinds that can sustain Bitcoin's growth in the long term, including: Sustained high inflation: due to ever-increasing government debt ceilings, I expect global fiat currency inflation will stay over 4% until a Great Depression in 2030. State-funded virtualization: central banks worldwide are cooperating to create digital currencies, IDs, and smart cities . Increased information censorship: Unfortunately, internet censorship continues to increase. Eventually, this oppression will likely spread to money through CBDCs, causing mass-frustrated citizens to flock to Bitcoin. Therefore, the total data suggests Bitcoin is experiencing an inflection point in its global monetary adoption process. Bitcoin is here (Author) Human technology adoption follows a 5 stage growth pattern of Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards. Similarly, global monetary adoption follows a 4 stage pattern. As monetary adoption proceeds, public perception of the underlying asset shifts between Collectible, Store of Value, Medium of Exchange, and Unit of Account. As technological and monetary adoption are both fueled by human cognition, each stage of the adoption process has correlating ideals and principles. Inflection points in the technological/monetary adoption process occur alongside drastic changes in public perception. During 2012 - 2015, Bitcoin was widely perceived as a Collectible. Consequently, Bitcoin was sold on 'Mt. Gox,' a website for digital trading cards. During 2015 - 2022, Bitcoin was perceived as a Store of Value. During this period, we have seen the rise of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitcoin investment products, altcoins, and DeFi. During 2022 - (unknown), Bitcoin will be seen as a Medium of Exchange. Going forward, people will increasingly use Bitcoin to buy and sell goods. Each 'inflection point' in technological/monetary adoption is a cycle of death and rebirth that causes the underlying asset to grow stronger. Bitcoin's previous inflection point occurred between 2014 to 2015 when Bitcoin left its Early Adopters Stage. This shift in public perception caused Bitcoin to evolve from a Collectible into a Store of Value. Bitcoin Golden Ratio Multiplier, Technology / Monetary Adoption Inflection Points (LookIntoBitcoin 3/17/2023) Currently, Bitcoin is experiencing its second inflection point. Bitcoin is leaving its Early Majority stage and entering the Late Majority stage of its technology adoption process. Simultaneously, Bitcoin is monetarily evolving into a Medium of Exchange. Over the next two years, I expect Bitcoin's daily user count will grow drastically to reflect this inflectional shift. Bitcoin User Metrics (BuyBitcoinWorldwide) To determine Bitcoin's long-term price targets, we further analyze Bitcoin’s Elliott wave patterns, previous bull markets, and the 30-week Simple Moving Average and Power-Law bands. Bull Markets Climb A Wall Of Worry; Bitcoin Bottom = $15,500 Fundamentally, Bitcoin's price action follows Elliott wave chaos patterns. 'Elliott waves' are cyclical and estimable patterns of mass human emotion. Elliott waves are fractal , appearing chaotic on short timescales and ordered on long timescales. To trade Bitcoin (or any asset) successfully, it is essential to identify the highest timescale Elliott waves. To begin, Bitcoin's Daily chart completed a significant A-B-C wave corrective bottom with its November 21st, 2022 crash to $15,500: BTC:USD - 1D, Elliott Waves (TradingView 3/16/2023) Zooming into Bitcoin's Weekly chart, we can see that Bitcoin's 2022 downtrend is a correction in Bitcoin's all-time bull trend . Bitcoin's -78% decline from $68,984 to $15,500 fits precisely as Bitcoin's third bull market correction. Bitcoin's Weekly Elliott waves, Power-Law bands, previous bull markets, the 30-week Simple Moving Average, and the Technology/Monetary adoption inflection points provide the whole picture: BTC:USD - 1W, Elliott waves, Power Law bands, 30W-SMA, Technology / Monetary Adoption stages (TradingView 3/16/2023) Shown above, Bitcoin's 2022 downtrend was the 'death' of its Early Majority stage. This death is visually observable as the completion of Bitcoin's 2012 - 2022 Elliott wave pattern. Bitcoin's 2022 downtrend effectively killed all unnecessary Early Majority-era investment narratives and concluded a decade-long bull trend. Furthermore, Bitcoin's Power-Law bands show that only during the 'Mt. Gox' fiasco in 2014 were conditions equally bearish to 2022. This is because 2014 was Bitcoin's previous technology/monetary adoption 'inflection year.' Therefore, Bitcoin's 2022 low may become Bitcoin's 3rd best buying opportunity ever. As of early-2023, Bitcoin is in another process of rebirth . Bitcoin is climbing from its 2022 pit of death into its next bull cycle. Alongside this, the human perception of Bitcoin is evolving. BTC:USD - 1W, Elliott waves, Power Law bands, 30W-SMA, Technology / Monetary Adoption stages (TradingView 3/16/2023) I believe Bitcoin is in the bullish accumulation range of its next long-term uptrend. During this phase, the 30-week Simple Moving Average and the Power-Law bands typically act as support. Investors who buy dips on these indicators (without leverage) should outperform over the next two years. BTC:USD - 1W, 30-week SMA vs Power Law Trend (TradingView 3/16/2023) According to Bitcoin's past decade of cyclical price action, the next long-term top should occur within two years , peaking at $100k - $500k between March - April 2025. Bitcoin Downside Risk - Traders Must Stay Alert Although Bitcoin is bullish in the long term, there is still a very high downside risk. More 'black swans' can and will occur! When they do, I believe they should be bought. For this reason, it is essential to keep cash on the sidelines and begin dollar-cost-averaging now. Shown below is TrendSpider's automated Daily trendline analysis. Bitcoin is currently near the top of an expanding triangle at $28k/BTC. If Bitcoin breaks $28k, it can move higher to $32k. Conversely, if $28k holds as resistance, then Bitcoin can fall to $24k, $20k, or $18k. BTC:USD - Daily trendlines (TrendSpider 3/19/2023) Conclusion Bitcoin is experiencing its most transformational period ever . Public perception of Bitcoin is changing. Consequently, this should have a bullish impact on price. Bitcoin's fundamental, technical, cyclical, economic, and geopolitical dynamics are bullish in the long term. However, short-term market conditions remain bearish. For this reason, investors should stay nimble, begin dollar-cost-averaging now , and remain patient for any dumps to the 30-Week Simple Moving Average or Power-Law bands.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4589156-bitcoin-beginning-next-long-term-uptrend?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/10947325.jpeg

Matthew Homer, a former deputy superintendent with the New York Department of Financial Services, told CoinDesk the report was a ""damning indictment of the space that makes [the administration's] policy position crystal clear.""  ""The amount of attention given to digital assets is substantial, especially when viewed in comparison to other areas of financial services that have arguably been far more detrimental over the past few weeks. The assessment is striking in its definitive tone and broad brush strokes,"" he said.  The report looked at a number of claims and stated goals from the crypto industry, ranging from cryptocurrencies' role as investment vehicles and payment tools to its potential use in payment infrastructure. The report said that ""many [cryptocurrencies] do not have a fundamental value"" and noted other issues with the sector.  ""It has been argued that crypto assets may provide other benefits, such as improving payment systems, increasing financial inclusion and creating mechanisms for the distribution of intellectual property and financial value that bypass intermediaries that extract value from both the provider and recipient. Looking under the hood at these arguments, however, shows a more complicated picture. So far, crypto assets have brought none of these benefits,"" the report said.  Various disasters in the crypto sector, including last year's collapse of Terra, BitConnect and FTX, were cited as examples of how everyday Americans were harmed.  Other examples pointed to more subtle frauds, such as Long Island Iced Tea changing its name to Long Blockchain to ride a stock price wave despite not having anything to do with blockchain at the time.  The report also took a minute to say a centralized internet is easier, citing Signal creator Moxie Marlinspike.  It mentioned that forthcoming systems like the real-time payment FedNow network ""could bring significant benefits to vulnerable segments of the populations.""  ""Some have suggested that near-instant digital payment systems like FedNow may reduce the need for circulating digital money,"" the report said. ""In this case, the benefits of circulating digital money after FedNow is launched may be minimal. In fact, Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman commented in August 2022 that 'my expectation is that FedNow addresses the issues that some have raised about the need for a [central bank digital currency].'""  Despite listing out these concerns, the report did not delve deeply into recommendations for future regulations or congressional actions that could address the stated risks.  The section's conclusion acknowledged that the underlying distributed ledger technology ""may still find productive uses in the future"" for both government entities and private companies.  The report also acknowledged that ""some crypto assets appear to be here to stay,"" although it went on to note that ""they continue to cause risks for financial markets, investors and consumers.""  ""Much of the activity in the crypto asset space is covered by existing regulations and regulators are expanding their capabilities to bring a large number of new entities under compliance,"" the report said, pointing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""Other parts of the crypto asset space require coordination by various agencies and deliberations about how to address the risks they pose.""

42414154,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwk7K,1679435114,U.S. Senate’s Warren Calls for Crackdown on ‘Sham’ Crypto Audits,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and another prominent colleague urged the U.S. auditing watchdog to take action against “sham audits” of crypto companies, citing the contribution of such audits to the recent stresses in the U.S. banking system.  The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), which is authorized and overseen by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and funded by audited public companies, acknowledged the potential problem with crypto auditing to the lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), chair of the Senate Finance Committee.  PCAOB Chair Erica Williams said she’s concerned when the auditors her organization oversees “perform ‘sham audits’ – even for entities whose audits generally fall outside of our jurisdiction,” as she wrote in a February response letter shared by the lawmakers.  “Unfortunately, the PCAOB faces statutory limits when it comes to regulating the audits of certain cryptocurrency companies,” Williams wrote.  Warren, who is on the Senate Banking Committee that oversees the SEC and will be instrumental in crafting crypto legislation, and Wyden argued the board does have more legal reach than it’s letting on and can act with “broad responsibility to protect the integrity of the auditing system,” according to a letter they sent to Williams on Tuesday.  “Given that the ongoing use of sham audits of crypto firms conducted by PCAOB-registered auditors mislead the public and threatens the integrity of that auditing system – and we now know, potentially the banking and financial systems – you have both the authority and responsibility to rein them in,” the lawmakers argued.  Earlier this month, the PCAOB’s inspector general had also recently issued a warning that crypto companies’ reserve reports were often based on untrustworthy information – not genuine auditing.

The CME FedWatch Tool shows currently that over 87% of traders are predicting a 25 basis point (bps) rate hike on Wednesday, which would set the federal funds target rate range to between 4.75% and 5%.  BTC, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at about $28,050, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, although a brief midday jump had the BTC/U.S. dollar trading pair reaching as high as $28,605 on crypto exchange Coinbase – its highest point since June, data from TradingView showed.  ""Risk appetite is rallying on optimism the Fed is almost done with tightening and that they will help prevent financial stability concerns from getting out of hand,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in a Tuesday note.  Bitcoin has surged more than 15% over the past seven days and 69% so far this year. A Galaxy Research report Monday noted that on a risk-adjusted basis, BTC outdid a range of securities, indices and commodity assets and is 2023’s best-performing asset.  Traditional markets also turned green amid a banking rally and improved investor optimism. The S&P 500 closed up 1.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) rose 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively.  Regional banking stocks rebounded amid at least a temporary easing of investor fears about the banking sector’s stability. Shares of First Republic Bank (FRC) closed up 29% after a Wall Street Journal report that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was working with other bankers to stabilize the embattled California-based institution. On Monday, First Republic Bank’s stock sank 47% and was downgraded for the second time in a week by S&P Global. Shares of Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL) and Truist Financial Corp (TFC) jumped nearly 15% and 9%, respectively.  Beniamin Mincu, CEO of MultiversX, said in stressful times such as the current, banking near-meltdown, more people may “turn to viable alternatives that really exist.”  “It is precisely in this type of crisis that the necessities of a new type of money that is digital, fast, secure, transparent and accessible to everyone in the world become evident,” Mincu told CoinDesk via a Telegram message.  Yet, James Lavish, managing partner at Bitcoin Opportunity Fund, doesn’t think investors are ready to treat bitcoin as a safety asset.  “In reality, bitcoin continues to trade like a leading risk-on asset,” Lavish told CoinDesk in an email.  With many observers taking heart from UBS’s purchase of troubled rival Credit Suisse on Monday for $3.2 billion and a potential dovish turn by the Fed, “this has stopped a ton of shorts” of BTC and the price has “benefitted from that,” he added.  Singapore-based crypto options trading firm QCP Capital wrote in a Telegram broadcast Tuesday that if the Fed does “cede to market pricing and start forecasting cuts this year,” equities and crypto will ""certainly continue their rally.""  “However, if they stick to their guns, trusting their ring-fencing to take care of the liquidity issue and choosing to ignore potential credit issues to come, then we will likely see a premature top for this BTC rally tomorrow,” QCP Capital added.

Vote of confidence ahead of court ruling on SEC-Ripple case,"Ripple Labs' native token XRP ( XRP-USD ) gained over 30% on Tuesday as investors appeared confident of a win for the cryptocurrency space ahead of a landmark court ruling on the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against Ripple. The SEC in 2020 sued the blockchain payments firm and two executives, alleging that the company raised over $1.3B through an unregistered digital asset securities offering . A central question of the case is whether XRP ( XRP-USD ) is a security or not. If the court rules that it is indeed a security, that would mean all cryptos would be under the SEC's oversight, which is widely seen as negative for the sector. It remains unclear when the New York court will deliver its ruling. In Ripple's defense, attorney James Filan cited a recent ruling by a bankruptcy judge clearing the sale of Voyager Digital's assets to Binance.US. The judge had slammed regulators for not agreeing on whether cryptos are commodities or securities. ""Despite external pressure being applied by U.S. regulatory authorities, the XRP Ledger aims to provide a digital payment infra not just for individuals, but also for existing financial entities such as central banks,"" said crypto research firm Messari in a tweet .

42411012,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvUGZ,1679433938,"On-Chain Indicator Suggests Bitcoin, Ether Are Trading at a Discount","An on-chain indicator that tracks bitcoin’s (BTC) relative valuation shows the asset has gotten “cheaper” in 2023, despite the recent price increase.  Bitcoin’s Network Value to Transaction (NVT) ratio has declined 60% for the year to date, despite a 68% increase in BTC’s price.  BTC’s current NVT ratio of 36.18 is slightly below the 365- day average of 36.40. The current ratio trails the 30-, 60-, 90- and 180-day NVT ratios, which all range between 44 and 49.  The cause of the decline is that BTC transaction activity is outpacing the increase in its actual price. Higher network activity indicates bullish sentiment, and the extent to which it has exceeded BTC’s price rise implies that bitcoin is trading at a discount.  The NVT ratio measures the relationship between an asset’s market capitalization and its network transfer volume.  Market capitalization represents the price of an asset multiplied by the total number of coins in circulation. Network transfer volume is a measurement of how much BTC is moved from one address to another.  Analysts view transfer volume on par with company earnings – akin to the price to earnings (P/E) ratio in equities. Like the P/E ratio, NVT ratios are used as a tool to examine the cost of a digital asset.  Traditionally, higher NVT ratios indicate that an asset is becoming more expensive, while lower NVT ratios indicate the opposite.  Investors would be keen to note the extent of NVT ratio fluctuations, which tend to oscillate. For that reason, daily moves should be viewed in context with a longer-term trend. For BTC, the overall trend has been downward since December 2022.  The same dynamic holds true for ether (ETH) because its NVT ratio of 74.16 is down 68% since January, by comparison to a 51% increase in ETH’s price.  ETH’s current NVT ratio is trading at a 19% discount to its 365-day average, a larger spread than the one that exists between BTC’s current and 365-day NVT ratios.  Ironically, the difference is almost identical to the 18% spread in year-to-date performance for BTC and ETH, as part of their strong overall correlation.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/21/on-chain-indicator-suggests-bitcoin-ether-are-trading-at-a-discount,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f490a8f66f6e1f7bdb2206d32abc67162706df75-3500x1969.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414139,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwikQ,1679431357,Yat Siu Says ‘Pro-Capitalist’ Asian Countries Are More Ready to Embrace Web3,"LOS ANGELES — Yat Siu, co-founder and chairman of Web3 game developer and investment firm Animoca Brands, said Tuesday that Asian companies are more willing to adopt and invest in Web3 technologies than their North American counterparts.  During a fireside chat at the Outer Edge conference in Los Angeles Siu said that among major international game publishers and their 400 portfolio companies, those located in Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and across Southeast Asia are far more active in discussing, building and embracing technologies such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) and the metaverse than those located in the U.S.  Siu explained that due to the harsh crypto winter that hit many U.S.-based companies last year, its impact on NFTs has steered many U.S. firms away from investing in Web3. However, enthusiasm to invest in blockchain is still alive in Asia.  “The adoption, readiness and willingness actually sits in Asia. Like, you go and want to sell something to people in Japan or Korea or Southeast Asia, you'll find a much more ready market versus over here.”  He also claimed that intellectual property (IP) development is more advanced across Asia and the “pro-capitalist” sentiments among investors in the region have prompted their investments in Web3 technologies.  ""A large swath of people in the U.S. kind of start to veer somewhat outside of capitalism. Capitalism doesn't work for them,"" he said. ""Whereas in Asia, a lot of people are very pro-capitalist because of their own experiences with what capitalism has brought to them in their lifetime.""  ""We joke about this, but it's kind of true – the ‘American Dream’ is much more alive and well in Asia than it is in the U.S. for all the things [Web3] that we just discussed,"" he added.  Recently, countries in Asia have been making moves to embrace Web3 at a national level. In October, Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said in a policy speech that the country would be investing in NFTs and the metaverse in its digital transformation efforts. In November, Japan’s Digital Ministry said it would create a decentralized autonomous organization to further explore its use of Web3 technologies.  In January, South Korean government said it would create a metaverse replica of its capital city, Seoul, to help the country improve its public services in a virtual setting.

42414144,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwjAx,1679429975,Crypto Exchange BitMEX's Acting CEO: We Have Gone Through the ‘Valley of Death’,"Crypto exchange BitMEX was built to weather the current market turmoil caused, in part, by the failure of three U.S. crypto-friendly banks within a week, said Stephan Lutz, acting CEO and group chief financial officer.  ""The current market situation is actually what BitMEX originally was built for by our founders,"" he told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" on Tuesday.  ""Since the end of last year, we think we have been through the valley of death,"" he added. ""We see positive signs in the market and we are able to reap those benefits. We are very grateful that the ecosystem and the community trusts us as a real crypto exchange that is focused on crypto.""  Lutz said that if a crypto exchange is focused on derivatives, is safe, segregates client assets and has limited to no connection to the fiat world, it is likely thriving. BitMEX, which outlines its 2023 predictions in a new report, is seeing a rise in its volumes and market share.  Three scenarios  In the report the exchange details three scenarios it sees playing out this year for the crypto industry. In the first, risk appetite for quality crypto assets recovers as the pace of Federal Reserve interest rate hikes slows.  In that scenario, Lutz said, “we go back to quantitative easing [and] more money supply which drives inflation” and, in turn, “drives crypto prices to the extent that you use your crypto, bitcoin in particular, as an inflation hedge.” He said that’s what has occurred over the past two weeks.  In the second scenario investors remain cautious. According to Lutz, that means people are waiting “before going back significantly into crypto.” If they do invest, the report advises looking for projects with legitimate use cases.  The third scenario depends on whether regulators are embracing crypto and the “likelihood that some jurisdictions will figure out how they deal with crypto regulation and therefore provide certainty for investors [on] how to deal with it,” Lutz said. That would then lead to increased transparency and trust in crypto players, he said.  The proposed nakaDollar  Earlier this month, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes proposed a stablecoin called the nakaDollar (NUSD).  Hayes said the bitcoin and bitcoin derivatives-backed token would be considered extremely liquid and appealing to traders. It would rely on member crypto firms to maintain a peg to the U.S. dollar.  Lutz said the token would be a “stable unit of account that is bound to the U.S. dollar in terms of exposure, but without the risks of the current stablecoin system.”  Hayes’ nakaDollar idea is a “natural one, if you think about it,” Lutz said.  ""We believe if it's followed – and there will be people who will take up the idea because it needs to be a decentralized idea in a way to make it to make it credible – that [nakaDollar] will really be or can be a game changer in the whole crypto industry.""

42421307,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpW9,1679426675,Bitcoin and the Liquidity Question: More Complex Than It Seems,"Three years ago this past weekend, markets were reeling from a particularly bad week. The S&P 500 had lost almost 17% of its value, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had suffered its worst one-day drop on record, and bitcoin (BTC) had plummeted over 50% to just below $4,000 before recovering slightly. The number of COVID-19 cases was rocketing up around the world; New York City was closing all bars, restaurants and schools; in Spain, we were several days into lockdown. Things were looking bad.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  The financial machine was springing into action. On March 15, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points to almost zero and committed to boosting its bond holdings by at least $700 billion. The message was one of “we’ll do whatever it takes,” and it worked. The global economy staggered and then limped, but markets soared.  That week made history on so many levels. It also unleashed a wave of armchair virologists on Twitter to keep us up to date with every minutia of the COVID threat. We didn’t know it then but that wave set us up for what we’re living through today.  If you’ve spent any time on Twitter over the past week, you’ll have noticed a new breed of liquidity experts telling us that the Fed’s actions over the past few days mark a reversion to quantitative easing (QE) and/or a pivot. In 2020, more of us got into the habit of getting our news from Twitter, regardless of the quality. Fast forward three years and we have a similar mindset: New liquidity pontificators are trying to teach bona fide experts, and disinformation blends with nuance to create an uncomfortable mix of hope, distrust and confusion.  Read more: David Z. Morris – Does Bitcoin’s Rally Vindicate the ‘Inflation Hedge’ Thesis – or Is Risk Back on the Menu?  Superficial social media analysis aside, the events of three years ago also set us up for what we’re going through today on a more serious level. The liquidity that the Fed would inject into the economy in 2020-2021 created an easy money environment that pushed up asset values, flooded startups with eager venture capital funding and loaded bank balance sheets with low-yielding government bonds as well as some riskier securities. It also ended up fuelling the steepest increase in consumer prices in over four decades.  This, in turn, triggered the fastest interest rate hiking cycle since the 1980s, which decimated asset prices and destabilized the equilibrium between bank assets and liabilities. The crisis that began in 2020 as the pandemic introduced unprecedented stimulus entered a new phase three years later almost to the day, with the closure of three U.S. financial institutions in the space of a week and the disappearance of a 166-year-old global systemically important bank (Credit Suisse) as a separate organization.  As it tends to do when faced with banking system strain, the Fed has again jumped into action. To make more funds available to meet withdrawals, two Sundays ago it announced the opening of a new financing facility called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). This enables banks to deposit government debt as collateral in exchange for a loan of 100% of its face value, even if the collateral market value is much lower.  Here is where the crypto market started to get excited. From a local low of $19,700 on Friday, March 10, BTC went on to soar 42% to over $28,000 nine days later. (Stock and bond markets also rallied, but by insignificant amounts in comparison.) Crypto Twitter celebrated the end of monetary tightening, the onset of a new QE and the dawn of a new bull run.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite 'Too Big to Fail' Debate  Things do indeed look more positive for the crypto asset market, but for more complex reasons than the “QE is back!” chorus would have you believe.  Technically, it’s not  QE involves the direct purchase of securities by the Fed. This is not (yet) happening. The BTFP is, however, a type of monetary easing. The Fed is lending at par against bonds that are worth less, essentially bringing forward the bonds’ full value. The difference between the market value of the bonds and the 100% of face value the Fed will lend is new money in the system.  So far, $11.9 billion of the new facility has been used, according to a Federal Reserve report released last Thursday. This is a small amount compared to the volume of underwater bonds weighing down bank balance sheets (just the total amount of unrealized losses on securities held by U.S. banks is around $650 billion). But banks will only use this facility if they 1) need to (it’s not cheap funding), and 2) have the requisite quality of collateral.  BTC will benefit from looser monetary policy but the story is more nuanced than it may seem.  A more worrying surge was seen in the Fed’s discount window, through which banks borrow directly from the Federal Reserve rather than from other banks. During the week leading up to March 15, banks had borrowed a record $152.8 billion from the discount window, even higher than during the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.  Technically, this is not a new money injection as the banks deposit collateral in exchange for the loan. But whatever the collateral terms, the Fed is essentially exchanging less liquid assets for more liquid ones – bonds for cash. This increases the circulation of funds in the market, which boosts liquidity.  But the economy as a whole just got a lot less liquid. The discount window surge highlights how scared banks are. Fed support is seen as a last resort for banks. They only turn to the Fed when they can’t borrow from each other because it is a more expensive option. If banks are not lending to other banks, you can bet they’re not lending to corporate customers either. This wave of liquidity supposedly engulfing the market as a result of the Fed’s moves? Aside from the relatively small amount advanced via the BTFP, it’s not yet real.  Then again, it doesn’t really need to be for markets to react. What matters more for markets are expectations, and they seem to be signaling that tightening is pretty much over and that the current crisis will force the Fed to loosen fast. We’re seeing this in Fed funds futures pricing which is now suggesting Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will start cutting rates in July. We’re also seeing it in the oil price, which recently dropped to its lowest daily close since late 2021 on the back of lower expected demand. You don’t need as much energy if activity is slowing.  Expectations of easing matters more for BTC  Loose monetary policy generally implies more funds (because money is relatively easy to borrow) chasing higher returns (because lower interest rates means lower yields on safer assets such as government bonds). This tends to push investors further out the risk curve because that’s where the higher returns are, which is why we talk about higher “liquidity” favoring “risk assets.”  Among risk assets, BTC is the most sensitive to swings in liquidity. It is unarguably a risk asset in the traditional sense of the term (given its high volatility), and unlike stocks and bonds it has no earnings or credit rating vulnerability. Unlike almost all other assets it is untethered to the real economy except through the impact of liquidity flows. In an environment of likely earnings expectations downgrades and overall corporate fragility, a “pure play” is likely to appeal to macro investors. The recent outperformance of BTC relative to other crypto assets, as well as the jump in spot and derivatives volumes, suggests that this is already starting.  A more crypto-specific narrative is building  The expected renewal of U.S. money printing, should it materialize, will further debase the dollar, highlighting the store-of-value properties of assets with a fixed supply. Gold has been the traditional haven over the centuries, and earlier reached its highest point since the aftermath of the Ukraine invasion early last year. However, gold is not exactly seizure resistant, is hard to store unless via a centralized third party,and is complicated to spend. BTC, on the other hand, is digital, can be moved with relative ease, and is an evolving technology with use cases yet to emerge.  Even more immediate is growing concern around banking. Approximately 14 years ago, Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto embedded in the very first block a link to the headline “Chancellor on the Brink of Second Bailout for Banks” (taken from the London Times). While few expect bitcoin to replace fiat any time soon, many may come to see it as an insurance asset that can be used for economic activity in the unlikely scenario that banks stop working. Bitcoin was created as an alternative to traditional, centralized finance – that narrative is taking on a greater relevance in today’s uncertainty.  All this is likely to feature in portfolio recalibration decisions of professional managers who left the crypto market next year, as well as those who have so far been bemusedly or skeptically watching from the sidelines. All will remember what happened the last time monetary easing combined with a rapidly changing marketplace and a new type of liquid asset. Many will want to avoid being accused of missing out a second time, especially when many of the imagined barriers three years ago (an unstable system, consumes too much energy, likely to be banned) have to some extent been debunked.  It’s not just professional investors who are taking notice. On Thursday, Axios reported that app monitoring service Apptopia detected a sharp increase in crypto wallet downloads since the closure of Silvergate Bank. Institutions tend not to custody crypto assets on mobile apps, so this is more likely to reflect a pickup in retail interest.  And it could be the pickup is warming up, just like the evolving banking crisis. The Fed’s moves to shore up U.S. banks may have stemmed some of the panic, but they are metaphorically a Band-Aid on a severed artery.  A paper published last week by a team of researchers from Stanford, Columbia and other universities shows that 10% of banks have larger unrecognized balance sheet losses than Silicon Valley Bank; 10% have lower capitalization and almost 190 banks are at risk of impairment to insured depositors, with roughly $300 billion of insured deposits potentially at risk. Trust in the banking system seems to be wobbling, judging from the strong flows out of banks – last week, money market funds had their largest inflows since April 2020. The banking problems in Europe are for now distinct but still relevant, and corporate troubles there, exacerbated by weakened trading desks and wealth management divisions, could further hurt the very confidence the global banking system relies on.  In this environment, an asset that does not rely on centralized trust is likely to attract more attention. What’s more, after a year of an astonishing sequence of serious blows, crypto markets have shown remarkable resilience in recent months. Even amid the stress of the weekend before last, trades got executed, assets moved, a stablecoin depeg rectified and the only transaction limitations were due to lack of access to fiat on-ramps outside traditional banking hours. In other words, crypto markets worked. Banking didn’t; given the number of trading halts endured last week, traditional markets didn’t either.  So while BTC and the broader crypto ecosystem will benefit from looser monetary policy, more so even than other assets, the story is more nuanced than it may seem.  On the one hand, monetary policy is not notably looser just yet, although expectations of a shift in that direction do seem to have been driving this week’s moves. On the other hand, the crypto narrative is gearing up to take on even more layers, each of which will lend price support. It is also gearing up to take on even more relevance during what lies ahead.  Many of us in our ecosystem have long been aware that BTC is unlikely to truly show its longer-term worth at a mainstream level until the global financial system’s fragility is laid bare for all to see. That means a lot of pain for a lot of people.

42393746,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpA15F,1679424109,"This Ukrainian Startup Is Looking to Automate Crypto Crime Reporting Using Smart Contracts, AI","HAPI Labs has launched a platform for reporting scam- and crime-related addresses, in partnership with Ukraine’s cyber police.  Scamfari OSINT, currently in beta mode, allows users to report cryptocurrency wallets related to scams, sanctions violations, terrorism financing and other crimes. The project is supported by Ukraine’s cyber police, which will work on freezing such wallets, the agency announced on Monday.  HAPI, a crypto startup working on cybersecurity tools for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, previously ran two-week-long contests asking people to find and report crypto wallets related to fraud and other crimes, with a special focus on the money pro-Russian volunteers raise to help Russian troops invading Ukraine. Users who report the most wallets get rewards in HAPI’s own token, but only if the reports are approved by the firm’s team and are really linked to some kind of crime.  Read more: Coins of War: How Crypto Keeps Feeding Russia's War Despite Sanctions  This week, another week-long contest went live. Even after this “season” is over, the hunting for criminal crypto will not stop but continue on a new website.  Blacklist machine  It works like this: A user signs up via a Telegram bot, fills out a form and submits a blockchain address and a screenshot proof that the address is being used for criminal purposes.  Then, two HAPI staffers manually check whether reports contain truthful and relevant data, then either approve or reject them. After a report is approved the reporter is assigned a reward in HAPI’s own tokens, which are now trading around $13 each: $1 for a new address in the database, 10 cents for an address previously reported and $5 for an address related to a sanctioned person or entity, HAPI head of research Mark Letsyuk told CoinDesk.  For now, rewards are being distributed manually every two weeks, but in future HAPI wants to automate the reward distribution using smart contracts. The community might also have a vote soon as to whether to replace the HAPI token with a stablecoin as a reward, Letsyuk said.  “Many people in Ukraine lost their jobs [because of the war] and some made several hundred dollars during the past season,” he said. “In these times, it’s good money. Now, people want to try and do it on a regular basis.”  He added that since Scamfari OSINT launched in beta last week, over 15,000 addresses have been submitted, including the wallets raising funds for Russian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine.  In the future, HAPI is considering using AI to automate report approval, too, Letsyuk said: “We’re now feeding the reports we get to the [latest AI product by OpenAI] GPT-4 – it looks very raw at this point, but promising. Not trying to catch some hype here, but we believe that it can be helpful in the near future.”  The Ukrainian cyber police, in it announcement, underscored it will be looking particularly for wallets linked to financing Russian troops invading Ukraine.

42414151,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwjwi,1679422473,Coinbase Argues an Arbitration Case in U.S. Supreme Court as Crypto Makes Its Debut,"Coinbase (COIN) argued at the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday that its disputes over forcing customers into arbitration should freeze the courts while the arguments play out – a moment that breaks legal ground for crypto with the industry’s first high court appearance.  The case itself has little direct effect on the business of digital assets, though it could be significant for Coinbase and other crypto companies when they clash with clients. The crypto exchange essentially argued to the justices that when a court rules that a customer deserves to settle a dispute in a courtroom instead of the arbitration outlined in their user agreement, a company appeal should halt that case from progressing through the courts until the appeal is decided.  “Congress did something very unusual” by granting this power to immediately appeal when a court denies a forced arbitration, said Neal Katyal, a lawyer representing Coinbase, who argued there’s a “background rule” establishing that the law doesn’t allow for courts to keep going if it’s used. If the customers get to move into the phase where information and evidence is exchanged, a company could be “coerced into a massive settlement” as embarrassing information comes to light – sometimes in the press – negating the purpose of arbitration.  “That toothpaste can’t later be put back into the tube,” he said.  In Tuesday’s case, Coinbase Inc. v. Bielski, customer Abraham Bielski had initially accused Coinbase of lax protections when a scammer stole $31,000 from his account. A court found that he could go ahead and pursue that complaint in the courts, which Coinbase appealed. When the matter kept moving in court, the company argued its appeal should have stopped it.  “The entire cryptocurrency market is collapsing under our feet,” said Hassan Zavareei, who represented Bielski, arguing that purposeful and automatic delays by a company could rob a person’s chance to go after the company if the business fails during the wait. A plaintiff could “wonder whether Coinbase is going to be around” while awaiting the appeal.  As for Coinbase’s argument that Congress meant for the automatic “stay” – a legal delay – he said that it’s just not there.  “Congress says what it means and means what it says,” Zavareei said.  Chief Justice John Roberts said this appeal power offered companies a “huge benefit” that they don’t have to wait until a case is over.  “This is what they gave you,” he said. “Why isn’t that enough?”  Most of the justices peppered Coinbase’s lawyer with difficult questions, and often interrupted his responses. Justice Elena Kagan was particularly critical.  In the Coinbase case, she said, “This district court is not stepping on the appeals court,” adding that “the two can go their merry ways.”  Justice Brett Kavanaugh, on the other hand, at one point praised the Coinbase case for making a ""strong point"" about related statutes demonstrating congressional intent for this one.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/21/coinbase-argues-an-arbitration-case-in-us-supreme-court-as-crypto-makes-its-debut,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd02a6ab424c0b61b8e75b57bc1cd36830694782-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421227,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXhqmr,1679421818,Marta Belcher: Reframing Privacy for the Digital Age,"The battle is looming and is real. The battle, as Marta Belcher sees it, is the fight for online privacy, censorship resistance and freedom from surveillance.  Take the bill proposed by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), officially called the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act. It’s “pretty shocking, extremely broad and would have far-reaching effects on both the entire crypto space and on privacy technologies in general,” says Belcher, a civil liberties and cryptocurrency attorney. She is also the president and chair of the Filecoin Foundation, head of policy at Protocol Labs, special counsel to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and member of the Zcash Foundation Board. (Belcher has more jobs at this very moment than many people will have in their entire lives.)  Marta Belcher is a speaker at CoinDesk's Consensus festival in April.  This very moment, to her, is urgent. “We’re in this really interesting moment in time where our important privacy and civil liberties battles, which are being fought in the crypto sphere, actually have application and effect far beyond crypto,” says Belcher.  In a spirited defense of civil liberties and crypto’s ability to protect them, Belcher opens up about what she sees as the biggest threats to privacy, how the issue is bigger than just crypto and why “I think it's really important, as a community, to make sure that we are properly standing up and fighting.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  What first got you into this strange intersection of crypto, law and civil liberties?  I've always been interested in technology and civil liberties. I was in law school when the [former National Security Agency consultant Edward] Snowden disclosure happened [in 2013]. And, post-Snowden, I worked on a book as a research assistant about mass surveillance. I was really affected by the extent to which we are surveilled on a day-to-day basis in ways that are, I think, quite shocking.  Pre-Snowden, we had no idea. And post-Snowden we know, but we don't necessarily think about it or pay attention to it. And I still find it extremely chilling. And I'm very interested in the idea that we can create technologies that enable us to actually import anonymity, resistance to surveillance, and resistance to censorship. So cryptocurrency, to me, fundamentally, is such an important tool for civil liberties.  How do you see the lay of the land right now with respect to the battle for online privacy?  What we've seen over the course of the last few years has been that governments around the world, especially in the U.S., have been increasingly expanding the surveillance of the traditional banking system onto crypto.  We're at a bit of an inflection point. Because the ethos of crypto is really the exact opposite, right? The whole point of crypto is to protect civil liberties. So we’re in this really interesting moment in time where our important privacy and civil liberties battles, which are being fought in the crypto sphere, actually have application and effect far beyond crypto.  When you say “battles,” what do you mean specifically?  Obviously one very large thing that you have to talk about in this context is Tornado Cash, right? [The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctioning of Tornado Cash, the decentralized crypto mixing service.] The second is Senator Warren's bill, which is pretty egregious from a privacy and civil liberties standpoint.  Let’s start with Senator Warren’s bill. What do you find most objectionable?  The bill would fundamentally do two things. First, it would include pretty broad surveillance and registration requirements on effectively all participants in blockchain networks. That includes software developers, miners and log creators.  Second, it would effectively ban privacy-enhancing technologies and blockchain networks. And so from a civil liberties perspective it's pretty much a disaster.  Other than that, you love it!  The bill says that a large swath of participants in blockchain networks would need to register as money service businesses. They would actually have to register with the government as a money service business, and would have to develop very complicated anti-money laundering programs. And they have to surveil their users, collect the personal information of every person who's using their software and file reports with the government about those transactions.  And, of course, that's not actually possible, right? If you're a miner or a validator, the whole point of this technology is that you have no idea who's using the software. That's the point. So compliance is not just onerous but literally impossible in blockchain networks. It really would grind the blockchain ecosystem in the U.S. to a halt.  So that's the first thing the bill does. The second thing the bill does is it prohibits all financial institutions, which includes the money service businesses, from the first part. That really broad, expansive group that is now being considered money service businesses – they’re prohibited from handling, using, or transacting with digital asset mixers, privacy coins and any other anonymity-enhancing technology.  Effectively, it is banning using privacy-enhancing technologies, which includes privacy coins. It’s pretty shocking, extremely broad and would have far-reaching effects on both the entire crypto space and on privacy technologies in general.  What else do you see as a looming battle?  I would frame it as, in some sense, the crypto space and also the civil liberties space are playing both offense and defense.  How so?  A lot of what we're doing right now is just playing defense. In a post-FTX [failed crypto exchange] world, there are increasingly bills and proposed regulations that are targeting the ability to transact privately. So one thing that we need to do as a space is play defense, to try to kill those bills.  Right. What does it look like to go on offense?  We've seen a few lawsuits over these important privacy battles, including Tornado Cash. Obviously those take a very long time to resolve, and it may or may not resolve the right way. But I do think that these are important battles that we can play offense on. We've also seen lawsuits over, for example, the infrastructure bill, which also has surveillance requirements.  Read more: Marta Belcher - Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Privacy and Civil Liberties  In terms of playing offense, a lot of what happens right now in the traditional financial system is mass surveillance, in my view, and is actually unconstitutional.  Interesting. What’s the argument?  We've sort of just come to accept, for some reason, that a lot of our financial transactions get turned over to the government by default, without a warrant, in the traditional banking system. And this is just sort of normal surveillance that happens under the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws. And in my view, the [U.S. Constitution’s]Fourth Amendment is pretty clear.  For those of us who are rusty on the Bill of Rights, can you give us a refresher?  The Fourth Amendment says that in order to get information about citizens, the law enforcement needs to go get a warrant. They need to have probable cause. They need to go to a judge and get a warrant and then they can get information about citizens, right? But there is sort of a giant gaping hole in the Fourth Amendment in the shape of the third-party doctrine.  Oh, for sure. What’s the third-party doctrine again?  The third-party doctrine is this idea that if you hand over your information to a third party, then you have lost your reasonable expectation of privacy in that information. So whether that third party is a bank or Google or Facebook or your cellphone provider, if you've handed over information to a third party that information can go to the government by default without a warrant.  In the financial arena I think we have a really interesting moment where we have people who are very motivated, because of the ethos of crypto, to protect financial transactions. And I think it's really important because over the last few years the Supreme Court has actually been chipping away at the third-party doctrine and sort of recognizing that the things that you could learn about someone from their third-party transactions are very different now than 30 years ago. Because we live our entire life through third parties [such as Google and Facebook and our phones].  Earlier you said that these battles are not just about crypto but have implications beyond the space. How so?  For both Tornado Cash and Senator Warren's bill, I really think that people who care about privacy in general – even if they don't care at all about cryptocurrency – should be extremely concerned.  There's this idea where some people say, ""Oh, well, that's about money."" And it's OK if all anonymity-enhancing technologies are banned in the money context, or it's OK if software developers are arrested abroad because they worked on something that involves money. And I think that’s ridiculous. It's also very dangerous, because what we've seen in the space with Tornado Cash [with the targeting of private transactions] is a broader targeting of anonymity-enhancing technologies, beyond just crypto.  So if you care about Tor, if you care about encryption, if you care about the ability to do things anonymously, you should care about a bill that broadly targets anonymity-enhancing technologies, right?  What else do you see as key inflection points in the future with respect to online privacy? What else is keeping you up at night?  One of the things that's so difficult about this space, and one of the things that’s so difficult about policy in general, is that at any moment any random bill can be dropped. And while that bill may not advance, future bills might borrow language from that bill.  What’s an example?  Senator Warren's bill. Even if the bill doesn’t advance, when we have the next omnibus [spending] bill – similar to the infrastructure bill, a must-pass 1,000-page bill where there’s absolutely no time or interest in debating any of the small clauses – I am worried that the language that people will borrow, or try to push in, will be the same language from Senator Warren's bill.  So even when you see random bills that don't seem to be something you should worry about, I think it's really important, as a community, to make sure that we are properly standing up and fighting. Because at literally any moment there could be an omnibus bill where this language just gets thrown in.  We saw that with the infrastructure bill, right? No one knew that that was coming. And it was sort of a shock to see two provisions that could have a massive impact on the cryptocurrency space added just as a throwaway. So part of what makes this all so scary is that anything could happen at any time.  We’ll leave things on that cheery note.

42414140,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwiv2,1679421600,"Magic Eden Embraces Ordinals, Releases Bitcoin NFT Marketplace","As Bitcoin-based Ordinal NFTs continue to gain popularity, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Magic Eden is launching a fully audited Bitcoin NFT marketplace.  Traders on Magic Eden will be able to purchase inscriptions, or non-fungible tokens minted on satoshis within the Bitcoin network. To help collectors do so, the company is integrating support for Bitcoin wallets Hiro and Xverse to allow traders to list, purchase and sell Ordinal NFTs.  “On Bitcoin, all media that is uploaded onto the chain cannot be changed or removed,” said Jack Lu, CEO and co-founder of Magic Eden, in a press release. “This simplicity is embraced by many creators who want to create true collectibles that are inscribed onto the chain.”  To kick off its marketplace launch, Magic Eden is teaming up with popular Ordinal collections Taproot Wizards, Inscribed Pepes and Bitcoin Bandits to help onboard its users to Bitcoin-based NFTs. The marketplace will also include information about NFTs such as Ordinal rarity and inscription numbers.  Interested in keeping up with Web3 news and trends? Subscribe to The Airdrop here.  Zhuoxun Yin, co-founder of Magic Eden, told CoinDesk the company wants to onboard more users to trade NFTs on the Bitcoin network, prompting the release of its latest product.  “There's a lot of high-value items that are being inscribed or created on the bitcoin chain, and for a very, very burgeoning NFT ecosystem that it's, it's been super exciting to see,” Yin told CoinDesk. “And at Magic Eden, we're working on a lot of cross-chain things anyway, and we felt like this was a really cool adjacent ecosystem for us to tackle.”  Magic Eden has historically been the leading Solana-based NFT marketplace, though it has recently been expanding across multiple blockchain ecosystems. In August, it added support for leading chain Ethereum, and in November tacked on support for popular sidechain Polygon.  Magic Eden isn’t alone in its efforts to build infrastructure to support Ordinals NFTs. On Monday, NFT platform Gamma.io launched its native marketplace, allowing users to mint and trade Bitcoin NFTs.

Focusing on the more credible medium-term bear cases, we address 1) the mining moratoriums, 2) general regulatory headwinds and 3) Bitcoin’s fee problem and disappointing layer 2 traction. As a call option on an alternative financial future in which U.S. dollar hegemony is decidedly less pronounced, Bitcoin retains attractive properties due to its max decentralization and (currently) fixed supply. Here we highlight macro and technical bull and bear arguments for Bitcoin, focusing specifically on the latter in order to test our conviction for 2023. Market Update: Why Did Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Other Digital Assets Rally After the Turmoil with U.S. Banks? The subsequent bailout of Silicon Valley Bank ( SIVB ) depositors highlighted the appeal of bearer assets, which can be self-custodied and whose monetary policy is independent of poor central bank policymaking. Ironically, Silicon Valley Bank partially failed due to too-large bets on the perceived safe-haven assets: U.S. Treasuries and U.S. Mortgage-Backed Agency debt. U.S. CDS spreads rose above their 2011 highs, baking in a bigger fight over legislated bailouts and the looming debt ceiling. With scant political consensus for legislation, we expect more money printing, dollar debasement, and, over the medium term, probably more treasury selling by our significant creditors, several of whom the U.S. government is now sanctioning. It’s probably not a great time to be a G7 creditor... Also, by the way, the Swedish Central Bank recently mentioned it needs a bailout from the Swedish Treasury amidst news that a major Swedish pension fund was a top 6 shareholder in Signature ( SBNY ), SVB, and First Republic ( FRC ). We think Bitcoin would be well-positioned if further bank share weakness prompts news flow like that. Current Bitcoin Cycle Looks Familiar Source: Arcana. Data as of 2/4/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a prediction of future results. Two Macro Bull Arguments for Bitcoin: The U.S. government has amassed an amazing amount of debt and the only way to overcome this, long term, is to debase the value of the dollar. Whether debt limit and other spending fights or a recession triggers this—or whether the tipping point happens in the next decades—is unknowable, but Bitcoin may serve as a hedge to this (as may gold). Central banks bought record amounts of gold in 2022. Countries on the fringes of the financial system continue to see both economic and negotiating value in adopting private, censorship resistant bearer assets. We expect a “big bang” at some point, such as Saudi Arabia officially buying Bitcoin for its state reserves. Seven Technical Arguments for Bitcoin: Bitcoin’s 30-day volatility plunged below that of the S&P 500 Index’s in early January, as both buyers and sellers looked elsewhere amidst declining liquidity. Given the history of the asset, we don’t think this is sustainable. Historically, Bitcoin has never fallen for two consecutive calendar years. The current bear market (duration) exceeds the average of 380 days. The current bear market (magnitude), at 77%, is close enough to the average (-83%) to justify beginning a dollar cost average approach for cyclical bears. November saw meaningful capitulation from long-term holders (6 months+), who realized two of the largest loss spikes in history, peaking at levels similar to the 2015 and 2018 cycle lows. Bitcoin is highly correlated to M2 growth, which recently hit 0% y/y in the U.S. for the first time ever. But globally, money supply growth already bottomed in November. In fact, the three-month rate of global money supply change now exceeds the 12-month rate of change, historically a very positive indicator for a Bitcoin bottom (Figure 1). In the U.S., money supply will likely re-accelerate, as government deficits continue. Meanwhile outside the US, China money supply is now growing at 12%, a 5-year high, and the RMB is strengthening. Both are historically a tailwind for the Bitcoin price. Investors focusing only on the Fed may be missing the improving global liquidity (Figure 2). Bitcoin leverage ratio has fallen sharply, and both calendar futures and perpetual swaps have recently traded in a state of backwardation. This suggests the market was heavily hedged for further downside risk. Figure 1: Bitcoin Price vs. Global Money Supply Growth Source: Bloomberg. Data as of 1/25/2023. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities referenced herein. Figure 2: Global Money Supply Growth Has Re-Accelerated—Just Not in the U.S. Source: Bloomberg, VanEck Research. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Seven Bear Arguments for Bitcoin: Regulation continues to tighten, as the consequences of the Biden executive order work their way through federal agencies. The lack of a Bitcoin spot ETF serves as a powerful symbol from U.S. regulators that the asset is not fit for traditional fiduciaries. Localities such as New York State and Canada’s British Columbia have put moratoriums on fossil-fuel based Bitcoin mining, hoping to restrict Bitcoin’s high energy usage. U.S. stocks and bonds have both fallen in the same calendar year only three times in history. In two of the three (1931 and 1969) the U.S. devalued vs. gold within two years by restricting convertibility. If 2022’s losses predict accelerating capital controls, then Bitcoin price may suffer. Recent Federal Reserve minutes reveal that FOMC members still see risks tilted to inflation (not balanced) and are concerned about “an unwarranted easing in financial conditions, especially if driven by a mis-perception by the public of the Committee’s reaction function.” Bitcoin mining hash rate is too high relative to the price to provide a profitable backdrop for miners. Thus, in the absence of lower energy prices, miners are likely to continue to sell coins to pay for operating expenses, which is negative for supply/demand balance. Bitcoin’s “security budget” faces structural issues (in coming decades) as current, low transaction fees provide insufficient motivation for miners to secure the blockchain. As block rewards fall, the network will either become less secure, the price will rise, or the community will agree on a new model increasing the proposed 21M cap. Bitcoin’s lack of smart contract functionality is hindering adoption. Sidechains like Liquid have disappointed. Lightning is interesting, but is not permitted in NY State and overall volumes remain low. Focusing on the more credible medium-term bear cases, we address 1) the mining moratoriums, 2) general regulatory headwinds and 3) Bitcoin’s fee problem and disappointing layer 2 traction. On the mining side, we think some of the moratoriums are structural and some are cyclical. For example, Kazakhstan and Iran recently reportedly loosened some Bitcoin mining restrictions and returned some seized mining machines amidst lower energy prices and weaker economic activity. Russia also signaled plans to build more power generation capacity in Siberia in order to satisfy energy demand from Bitcoin miners. If and as inflation eases and policymakers embrace more pragmatic approaches to energy sustainability (such as an “all of the above” approach including natural gas and nuclear), innovation and pro-growth perspectives may re-emerge. For context, Bitcoin mining consumes approximately the same amount of energy as U.S. Christmas lights. Traditional payments rails consume 12x more electricity than the Bitcoin network, whose energy usage scales with hash rate (economic security), not with the number of transactions. The tighter regulatory environment, especially in the U.S., is not easily reversed. Specifically, Biden’s executive order in January 2022 focused multiple agencies on addressing “the risks…of digital assets” with a focus on consumer and investor protection and countering illicit finance. These actions, along with confidence-shattering events like the bankruptcies of FTX, Celsius and 3AC, clearly slowed Bitcoin’s market share gains vs. banks. The January 3 joint statement from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC punctuated the coordinated regulation with this crucial line: ""Based on the agencies’ current understanding and experience to date, the agencies believe that issuing or holding as principal crypto-assets that are issued, stored, or transferred on an open, public, and/or decentralized network, or similar system is highly likely to be inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.” Perhaps the best we can hope for this year is a stalemate in Washington, D.C. that prevents harmful over-regulation, while waiting for the market to turn its attention to 2024 and the possibility of the first pro-Bitcoin President in the form of Republican front-runner FL governor Ron DeSantis. One of our predictions in our 2023 crypto outlook is that SEC Chair Gary Gensler would leave the SEC this year after a victory vs. Ripple ( XRP-USD ) in the ongoing case over unregistered securities. While most may consider this a longshot, we note that the median SEC Chair tenure is only two years. On Bitcoin’s transaction fee problem and disappointing layer 2 progress : despite sporting the largest market capitalization among cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin’s transaction fees rank #4, after Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), Uniswap ( UNI-USD ), and Binance Smart Chain. The fact that people pay fees to use these other blockchains that exceed (by an order of magnitude, in the case of Ethereum), the fees paid to use Bitcoin indicates there’s a material, market-based demand for these alternative blockspaces. Bitcoin maximalists that deny this are denying the markets and clear evidence. Over the long-run, fees will have to rise, the Bitcoin price will have to rise, or the community will have to reconsider the 21M cap. Now, one wrinkle in this bear case to consider is the continued adoption of the Segwit soft fork, which removed Bitcoin transaction malleability (the ability of a transaction to have multiple valid TX IDs) and thus enabled the launch of the Lightning Network as a second layer on top of Bitcoin. Since Segwit and again following the 2021 Taproot upgrade to Segwit, each time Bitcoin transaction fees have spiked, Segwit adoption has risen anew, thanks to cheaper transaction fees for layer 2s. Thus, Lightning network capacity grew 46% in 2022 to 4,400 BTC, or $70M at the current BTC rate, even with lackluster BTC fee growth. While we are encouraged by recent Lightning network integrations from Twitter and Stripe, it seems that commercial backers of Lightning, such as Jack Mallers’ Strike, will need to get NY State regulatory approval before onboarding the mass payments market, and this seems a way off. For example, CashApp just enabled Bitcoin payments on top of Lightning for all users except those in NY. One development that may enable an end-run around NYDFS is Fedimint, a “community custody” tool built around Bitcoin that enables users to form groups where members look out for each other’s coins. Fedimint also provides full anonymity by using blind signatures to ensure users cannot be linked to the minting process that created their tokens. Taro is another Lightning Network upgrade that enables the issuance of assets and collectibile on Bitcoin that may include Tether or other stablecoins. On the back of these upgrades, Lightning may yet find product-market fit in emerging markets where Bitcoin and stablecoin adoption are higher and trust in banking systems is lower. But, that seems increasingly unlikely to be a near-term story in developed markets.

Our Conclusion: $250K Price Target Remains in Place As a call option on an alternative financial future in which U.S. dollar hegemony is decidedly less pronounced, Bitcoin retains attractive properties due to its max decentralization and (currently) fixed supply. While developed markets adoption may decelerate somewhat due to the reverberations of so many bankruptcies, and tighter global liquidity, our research in emerging markets continues to surface strong demand for Bitcoin and stablecoins amidst a generally lighter regulatory touch. We keep our $250k/Bitcoin long-term price target (half the market cap of Gold), pushing the target date to 2028, another halving year. If Bitcoin price does not make a new all-time high by 2026, we would consider our thesis broken. We believe a 1-3% allocation to open-source blockchain-based digital assets, such as Bitcoin and other smart contract protocols, is reasonable at this time given our research.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance. Fees and expenses associated with a cryptocurrency investment may be substantial. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of cryptocurrencies. Investors should conduct extensive research before investing in cryptocurrencies. Information provided by Van Eck is not intended to be, nor should it be construed as financial, tax or legal advice. It is not a recommendation to buy or sell an interest in cryptocurrencies. Emerging Market securities are subject to greater risks than U.S. domestic investments. These additional risks may include exchange rate fluctuations and exchange controls; less publicly available information; more volatile or less liquid securities markets; and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic or social instability. There are inherent risks with fixed income investing. These risks may include interest rate, call, credit, market, inflation, government policy, liquidity, or junk bond. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. This risk is heightened with investments in longer duration fixed-income securities and during periods when prevailing interest rates are low or negative. Gold investments are subject to the risks associated with concentrating its assets in the gold industry, which can be significantly affected by international economic, monetary and political developments. Investments in gold may decline in value due to developments specific to the gold industry. Foreign gold security investments involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, or political, economic or social instability. Gold investments are subject to risks associated with investments in U.S. and non-U.S. issuers, commodities and commodity-linked derivatives, commodities and commodity-linked derivatives tax, gold-mining industry, derivatives, emerging market securities, foreign currency transactions, foreign securities, other investment companies, management, market, non-diversification, operational, regulatory, small- and medium-capitalization companies and subsidiary risks. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. As with any investment strategy, there is no guarantee that investment objectives will be met and investors may lose money.

42421305,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnpT3,1679416438,Does Bitcoin’s Rally Vindicate the ‘Inflation Hedge’ Thesis – or Is Risk Back on the Menu?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has rallied stupendously this week, up 38% since March 11. It has outperformed basically every altcoin, including Ethereum. All of this has happened as various banks were self-immolating in protest of Jason Calacanis’ hairline.  Some have argued this is a vindication of bitcoin’s “inflation hedge” thesis, which was looking very battered, if not dead, just nine months ago. Bitcoin was going down as inflation was at its peak. But the argument is that we are only now seeing the real impacts of that inflation on the financial system, and Bitcoin is finally reacting. This would broadly track with crypto’s thinner market, making it less likely to respond, so to speak, ahead of time to various leading indicators.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That systemic chaos, not the erosion of consumer spending power, is what bitcoin is a “hedge” against. The idea that bitcoin would move neatly in response to dollar inflation was always at best a simplification of the actual argument. For one thing, as I’ve argued elsewhere, bitcoin will need wider adoption before those mechanisms can possibly work. There’s just too much speculation baked into the price right now for it to respond linearly to inflation, a problem we’ll dig into more here.  But beyond that, a more nuanced version of the inflation hedge thesis would spell out that the real risk bitcoin can hedge is the structural chaos of a financial crisis – say, the shutdown of a bank holding your savings. As we’re seeing right now, financial crises are increasingly tied to interest rates and other central bank maneuvers – about half of which come in response to inflation.  See also: Is Bitcoin an Inflation Hedge? Investors Are Still Unsure (2022)  Joe Wiesenthal at Bloomberg noted bitcoin’s performance and very tentatively hinted that it was performing as advertised. Galaxy Digital’s Alex Thorn pointed to this version of the thesis in a brief appearance on Castle Island’s ”On the Brink” podcast last week. Thorn will be talking in more depth about the bitcoin and inflation question at Consensus 2023 next month. I’ll certainly be checking it out.  Not so fast  But there’s also a case that this was a misinterpretation of the bitcoin price signal. Rather than spiking because of the long-tail impacts of inflation, maybe it’s spiking because markets see the opposite: an end or pause in central bank rate-hiking, signaling a glorious return for risk assets of all kinds.  The sharpest part of bitcoin’s rally, after all, has come since Monday, March 13, when it was announced that the floundering Silicon Valley Bank would get a bailout. In a second newsletter this morning, Joe Wiesenthal has changed his mind – “MAYBE YOU DON’T GOTTA HAND IT TO BITCOIN,” he tweeted.  Wiesenthal points to this piece by Bob Elliot of Unlimited Funds, on recent hedge fund losses, as helping shift his thinking. Broadly, Elliot describes hedge funds getting beaten up because they’ve suffered a double reverse. First, they ate the 2022 risk-off battering that nuked tech stocks under interest rate hikes. This is effectively what caused the crisis at Silicon Valley Bank, which foolishly bet on interest rates staying low far into the future.  Then in the past week, newer trading positions premised on higher rates for longer also got blown up. Basically, that’s because the bank failures are being seen as a red light for Fed rate hikes, a signal that the economy has slowed down enough.  “Many of these funds were positioned for a continuation of the inflationary, late cycle tightening of monetary policy,” Elliot writes. “The deflationary risk from a banking crisis quickly drove a change in fundamental conditions and market action, which caught many of these funds offside.”  That dynamic may also be helping bitcoin rally. After three banks blew up in a week, markets might be thinking the Fed is likely to stop hiking rates or even reverse, leading to a renewed risk party. That might have simply added to the deeper shift to bitcoin by those anxious about banking.  See also: Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank Reignite 'Too Big to Fail' Debate | Opinion  We’ll find out more on the question this week. The Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee is meeting Tuesday, and is expected to announce any interest rate hikes Wednesday. If the FOMC decides the threat of further financial calamity is high enough it could pause interest rate hiking. On the other hand, we’re still staring down 6% inflation, so I personally think another hike is still likely – maybe 0.25% to split the difference, but definitely not nothing.  If we get no hike, markets could interpret that as renewing the cheap-money bonanza, and bitcoin could truly go wild as a risk asset even as the Fed renews its commitment to fighting inflation at any cost.  The real test for a more nuanced version of the “inflation hedge” thesis will be whether further bank trouble leads to further bitcoin price rises, without interest rates directly in the mix. Until then, it’s all (in multiple senses) speculation.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

The patent, originally filed last week, would allow players of Sony products such as its flagship PlayStation to have an interoperable Web3 gameplay experience. Gamers would be allowed to transfer in-game assets between devices such as virtual reality (VR) headsets, tablets, computers and smartphones. The patent application also noted that “In some examples, the NFT can be used cross-generationally (e.g., from PS4 to PS5).”  The application also goes into detail around how NFTs would work for achievements and tournaments, noting “In some example embodiments, the task may include a victory in an esports tournament and the digital asset may be usable via the NFT by the first end-user entity across plural different computer simulations.”  Sony also specified in the patent that the framework aims to be interoperable between products outside the Sony ecosystem, such as the Xbox or a ""cloud-based video game,"" making assets fully transferable and usable between different gaming ecosystems.  It also outlines a function to prevent gamers from repeating tasks to earn the same NFTs with different products or games, noting the ability to prevent “performance of the task again in other instances of the computer simulation that are executed, and/or declining to provide additional NFTs for subsequent additional performances of the task.”  Sony has been recently making moves to grow its presence in the Web3 space, forging partnerships and testing early blockchain-based products. In November, the company released motion-tracking wearables, allowing gamers to control their avatars with their bodies in real time. In February, its internet provider division, Sony Network Communications, teamed up with blockchain network Astar to create an incubation program for companies focused on building NFTs and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) with real-world utility.

42414148,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwjrP,1679413436,Crypto Trading Tech Firm CoinRoutes Wins Patent for ‘Smart Order Router’,"CoinRoutes, a startup that aims to help crypto hedge funds and other investors get the best price on trades, has won a patent for its system of routing transactions to exchanges and estimating costs.  A patent for a “Distributed Crypto-Currency Smart Order Router With Cost Calculator” was awarded Feb. 14, with co-founders David Weisberger and Ian Weisberger (father and son) credited as the inventors, according to the document posted on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s website. CoinRoutes publicized the patent grant in a press release on March 16.  The invention allows “clients to keep control of their own private and exchange keys to their wallets and accounts, but can execute orders across multiple exchanges simultaneously,” according to the patent document.  David Weisberger told CoinDesk in an interview the setup is designed to be a “crypto-native” system for a digital-asset landscape where cryptocurrencies can be simultaneously bought and sold on multiple exchanges and traded against scads of other currencies and tokens.  The business of providing digital-asset trading technologies for big investors could become more competitive as the market emerges from the current crypto winter.  Talos, another provider of crypto trading technology, raised $105 million in funding in 2022 from investors including Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), PayPal, Fidelity and Castle Island Ventures. Other players in the trading-tech arena include Elwood Technologies, Gemini’s Omniex and Architect, a startup led by former FTX US President Brett Harrison.  Under the CoinRoutes’ setup, clients have their own servers, but reams of data on historical crypto trades are stored on regional servers. Weisberger said the cost of storing the data on their own servers can reach $25,000 in some cases. Instead, they can access the data from the regional servers at a tenth of the cost, Weisberger said.  “We’re the only ones doing it this way,” he said.  Obtaining the patent – a process that took five years – could provide a boost for CoinRoutes in marketing and signaling beyond any profit motive from claiming the intellectual property, he said.  “We’re not a patent troll,” he said. “It’s about as clear a proof as possible that we’ve been doing this for the most amount of time.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/21/crypto-trading-tech-firm-coinroutes-wins-patent-for-smart-order-router,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2933771349796703cc2057519bbc65e793ddcca5-754x424.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In other words, he's suggesting that the Fed should prioritize stability of the banking system over sticky inflation and at the very least keep the policy rate steady for now. Despite the tumult in the banking sector, triggered by the twin failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, the fed funds futures market is pricing in a 25 basis-point rate hike on Wednesday as the most likely outcome, according to the CME FedWatch tool , taking the target range to 4.75%-5.0%. Before the banking turmoil, traders were largely expecting a 50-bp move as inflation stays well above the central bank's objective. Bear in mind that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Friday assured that the U.S. banking system remains sound . Most crypto-exposed stocks traded in the green: Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), +2.3% , Marathon Digital ( MARA ), +2.7% , Coinbase Global ( COIN ), +3.7% , BIT Mining ( BTCM ), +5.7% , CleanSpark ( CLSK ), +5.6% , and Bit Digital ( BTBT ), +6.1% .

42414157,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwkNF,1679411524,Privacy-Focused Wasabi Wallet Reinstates ‘Coin Control’ Feature in Latest Software Upgrade,"Bitcoin privacy firm zkSNACKs has reinstated coin control in the latest iteration of its Wasabi wallet.  Coin control allows users to manually select the most private address and output configuration when sending bitcoin (BTC). Last year’s Wasabi 2.0 upgrade had introduced a more automated version of coin control called “privacy control” – much to the chagrin of Wasabi’s power users.  The bitcoin blockchain uses an unspent transaction output (UTXO) model where funds in a bitcoin address from prior transactions are considered unspent outputs. Those outputs can often be tied to a user’s identity thanks to know-your-customer (KYC) procedures at regulated entities such as centralized exchanges. From a privacy standpoint, these KYC’d coins are sometimes seen as compromised.  Coin control allows users to spot and separate the compromised outputs from more private ones, without the constraints of a fancy algorithm. The more private outputs can then be used for future transactions, lowering the chances of getting doxxed.  “Coin control is an essential privacy feature,” wrote one power user – openoms – on Wasabi’s github discussion board. “Taking it away and keeping users in the dark (behind a 'black box' algo) is counter-productive.”  Today’s announcement is part of Wasabi’s 2.0.3 release. Wasabi’s default settings will continue to automatically select which outputs to send for less-technical users.  “You asked, we listened,” zkSNACKs stated in a release provided to CoinDesk.  “We have an optional place to put the complexity, where skilled users can fine tune their wallet’s performance to their heart’s desire,” Max Hillebrand, CEO at zkSNACKs, said in the release.

42414143,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAwjGG,1679403600,IoTeX Blockchain's DAO Votes to Add Ether Liquid Staking Derivatives,"The IoTeX blockchain's governance community voted to support ether (ETH) liquid staking derivatives with 97% of token holders in favor of the move.  Some 141 million IOTX were staked in favor of the network’s 13th improvement proposal (IIP-13), which increases the IOTX staking ratio to enhance network security by expanding the number of validators, or entities that process transactions and maintain the blockchain.  The proposal also suggests natively adding support to represent staking buckets as non-fungible tokens so that liquid staking protocols can manage their stakes through smart contracts. That would allow developers to quickly launch liquid staking decentralized applications and potentially increase the staking ratio – improving the network’s use case among developers and contributing to the value proposition of IOTX tokens.  “Increasing the IOTX staking ratio and, therefore, the security of its blockchain has always been the goal for IoTeX,” co-founder Raullen Chai said in a message to CoinDesk. “The primary motivation behind IIP-13 is improved security and further decentralization of the IoTeX blockchain.”  With this feature implemented and deployed on a test network and on the live network, builders can quickly launch their liquid staking dapps, such as Lido and Rocket Pool, on the IoTex network.  Liquid staking refers to the exchange of staked ether for tokenized versions of the second-largest cryptocurrency that can be used in decentralized-finance applications. Uses range from using the tokens as collateral for loans or margin trading to earning yield.  Such tokens have been among the higher gainers this year, with Lido’s LDO and Rocket Pool’s RPL each gaining over 200% in the past three months, CoinGecko data shows.  Staking on the IoTeX blockchain is currently done directly on the network without connecting to smart contracts for support.  IOTX was recently trading at 2 cents.

42412584,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5OBU,1679401120,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Holds Steady at $28K Before Fed Meeting,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  After surpassing $28,000 for the first time in nine months, bitcoin traded between $27,300 and $28,350 over the past 24 hours, as investors await a decision by the Federal Reserve on interest rates on Wednesday. Traders are predicting a 25 basis point increase. The world’s largest cryptocurrency appears to be stalling at about $28,000. Swissblock Insights wrote in a report that the market appears to be betting on a 0.25 percentage point rate hike. “If the Fed proceeds to raise rates, the market shouldn’t react as aggressively. If the Fed pauses, however, we will see a strong move to the upside,” the report stated. “We expect volume to decrease and bitcoin’s price action to lose some steam going into the meeting.” Altcoins were down, with most losing 5% over the past 24 hours.  The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in its first-ever crypto-related case on Tuesday, when lawyers for crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) will attempt to convince the nine justices to pause a pair of class-action lawsuits against it. Though the case involves crypto, it isn't about crypto itself. Instead, the case is a fairly esoteric, procedural argument over whether a lawsuit can proceed in federal court while one party – in this case, Coinbase – is attempting to send the dispute to arbitration.  Arbitrum (ARB) token derivative markets are popping up on centralized and decentralized exchanges ahead of Thursday’s claim event. Decentralized marketplace Clober is letting traders purchase puts on ARB with strike prices of 50 cents, $1, $2, $4, $8 and $16. The options have cumulatively seen over $50,000 in trading volume in the past 24 hours after issuance. Put options are a type of option that increases in value as the price of the underlying asset, such as a token or stock, falls. “$ARB $2 put options are sold for 54 cents,” Clober said Tuesday. “By paying 54 cents, you can buy the right to sell your $ARB tokens for $2 at any time within 24 hours of claiming your $ARB airdrop.” “That guarantees $1.46 of profit per $ARB on claim day,” Clober added.     Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin continues to move in lockstep with the ratio of Wall Street's tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index to the broader S&P 500 index.

Concerns over legitimate crypto companies not being able to get access to a bank have spread to the U.K., where major lenders say they discourage access to riskier financial products for their customers’ own good.  “We are calling upon the government to find a path forward,” Su Carpenter, director of operations at CryptoUK, told Economic Secretary Andrew Griffith in a letter dated Tuesday. ""Blanket bans and restrictions of transfers from U.K. banks to crypto asset platforms … will have the effect of fundamentally undermining the government’s ambition to become a crypto asset hub,"" Carpenter added.  A parallel letter calls for action from two other regulatory agencies – the Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems Regulator.

42412567,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Nva,1679398720,"Bitcoin Miner Bitfarms Sinks to Fourth-Quarter Loss as Difficulty, Costs Rise","Bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF) dropped to a fourth-quarter loss as the price of bitcoin fell, costs rose and mining difficulty increased. The firm said it is examining acquisition prospects.  The Toronto-based firm posted an 8 U.S. cent loss per share, down from 5 cents profit the year before, according to a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Gross mining margin fell to 33% from 52% in the third quarter.  The fourth quarter was rough for many miners, with the price of bitcoin slumping to as low as $16,000 and mining difficulty increasing. Mining difficulty is automatically adjusted as more computing power comes onto the network to keep the time required to mine a block roughly stable at 10 minutes. The profitability of mining, measured in Luxor Technologies' hashprice, fell by 25% in the three-month period.  The firm failed to reach its reduced target of 5 exahash/second (EH/s) of computing power by year's end, achieving just 4.5 EH/s. Bitfarms cut its expectation from 7.2 EH/s to 6 EH/s in May, and to 5 EH/s in November.  ""Looking ahead, we plan to leverage our existing infrastructure in Argentina and utilize equipment credits to prudently expand our EH/s to 6.0 with our existing assets by year end 2023,"" President and CEO Geoff Morphy said in the filing. ""With our strengthened balance sheet, we are actively evaluating potential acquisitions that we expect to be accretive and complement our geographically diverse mining operations,""  Bitfarms has been trying to lower its debt obligations during the bear market, as are other miners including Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG) and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA). In February, bankrupt lender BlockFi took a two-thirds loss to settle $21 million of outstanding debt with Bitfarms. That helped Bitarms cut debt obligations by 86% compared to June 2022.  The Toronto firm said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) slumped to $7.4 million from $29 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the quarter was $27 million, roughly half the prior-year figure.  For all of 2022, Bitfarms reported a $1.15 basic loss per share, compared with earnings of 14 cents in 2021 while revenue fell 15%.

Airdrops refer to crypto projects sending free tokens en masse to their communities in a bid to encourage adoption.  Crypto users who frequently interact with new and existing platforms will likely receive an airdrop at some stage – which has quickly spurred the narrative of “airdrop farming” in Crypto Twitter circles, as large airdrops can be valued at thousands of dollars in effectively free money at peak.  Strategies from Crypto Twitter participants for a chance to claim the tokens – if and when they are issued – include bridging to zkSync, providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges such as ZigZag and conducting a few trades every week.  zkSync is a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup, a trustless protocol that uses cryptographic validity proofs to provide scalable and low-cost transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. In zkSync, computation is performed off-chain and most data is stored off-chain as well.  Data from Nansen shows nearly $8 million worth of tokens have flowed to the network in the past week.  Elsewhere, DefiLlama data shows the total-value-locked metric on the zkSync-based decentralized exchange ZigZag ballooned to over $13 million on Tuesday from last week’s $1.5 million. All of the flows to ZigZag were in tether (USDT) stablecoins, the data shows.  Such movements are likely coming in the anticipation of an token airdrop from other networks following layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum’s move to issue its token to users in a decision last week.  “The Arbitrum airdrop has brought renewed interest in airdrop hunting across other chains that have yet to launch a token,” Nansen analyst Martin Lee explained in a note to CoinDesk. “The confirmation of the Arbitrum airdrop also means that farming activity will shift away from Arbitrum and towards other chains.”  Last week saw layer 2 network Arbitrum confirm its much-awaited native token, ARB, to users based on their prior network activity. The tokens are claimable on Thursday, but futures markets are already pricing the tokens from $1.40 to over $9 apiece, as CoinDesk reported.",POSITIVE,USDT | ARB,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | USDT | ARB | AIRDROP,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/21/crypto-users-bridge-millions-to-zksync-blockchain-in-hopes-of-token-airdrop,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a44832b5d1feb152f8bf7d4aa3b9af6fea46f647-2400x1600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412564,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5NwW,1679396021,Fed Preview: Powell Likely to Raise Rates by 25 Basis Points Against Crypto Market's Hope for Status Quo,"""The Fed needs to pause at a minimum, or the banking issues escalate,"" David Brickell, director of institutional sales at crypto liquidity network Paradigm, tweeted early Tuesday, suggesting that the world's most powerful central bank should prioritize banking sector stability over fighting inflation and keep interest rates unchanged on Wednesday.  That's been the sentiment in the crypto market ever since regulators took over Silicon Valley Bank on March 10. Since then, bitcoin (BTC) has rallied over 40%, partly on hopes that recent banks failures will force the Federal Reserve to abandon its rate hike cycle that rocked risky assets last year. The central bank has raised rates by 4.5 percentage points since March 2022.  Some observers, however, expect the Fed to disappoint popular expectations when it announces its rate policy on Wednesday.  ""Our best guess is that the Fed hikes by 25 basis points given continued elevated inflation,"" Brian Rudick, senior strategist at crypto trading firm and liquidity provider GSR, told CoinDesk.  A rate hike of a quarter of a percentage point would lift the benchmark borrowing cost to the 4.75%-5% range and may see traders positioned for a pause trim their bullish exposure to bitcoin.  Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International, said, ""The Fed still views the banking sector as being well capitalized, and it will want to stress that the inflation battle is not won, and it remains too high, so a 25 bps hike seems very likely.""  On Sunday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the U.S. financial system remains resilient and the capital and liquidity positions of the banking system are strong.  Ostwald added that the Fed would find it more challenging to resume rate hikes if it pauses its tightening cycle now.  Trouble with a pause  Trades of liquidity-addicted risky assets might read the pause as a sign of an imminent early pivot toward rate cut and price in the same. That, in turn, would make it difficult for the Fed to resume rate hikes without shocking markets.  According to Michael Englund, principal director and chief economist at Action Economics, the Fed will follow the lead of the European Central Bank, which raised rates by 0.5 percentage point to 3% last week, sticking to its inflation fight despite the market chaos and fears of contagion from Credit Suisse's (CS) instability.  ""Our forecast is for a 25 basis point hike, and we continue to assume 25 basis point hikes in May and June as well,"" Englund said in an email.  ""If the Fed hikes rates, I think it would actually contribute to the notion that the Fed has the banking crisis under control, and may add to financial market stability, though bond prices would fall and yields would again price in a tighter policy path. The dollar would also get a lift,"" Englund added. (Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the dollar.)  A pause might put a question mark on the efficacy of the measures announced and trigger panic. Since the collapse of SVB, the Fed formed an emergency lending facility for banks and increased the frequency of its dollar swap lines from weekly to daily to shore up the global financial system.  Traders expecting the Fed to announce an end of quantitative tightening (sister of rate hikes) will also likely be disappointed.  ""We wouldn’t see the Fed’s new programs to address SVB as having broader market implications, and we assume that the Fed will maintain its QT (quantitative tightening) process even if there is a one-off bounce in the size of the Fed balance sheet,"" Englund said.  The narrative that QT is about to end gripped the market last week after data showed the Fed's balance sheet swelled by $300 billion in the seven days to March 15.  Dovish hike?  According to GSR's Rudick, Powell is likely to do a balancing act by striking a dovish tone after raising rates, offering a lifeline to risky assets.  ""Powell’s tone is somewhat dependent on the policy action. He will take a more hawkish [pro-tightening] tone to keep inflation expectations in check should the Fed pause or take a more dovish tone should the Fed hike,"" Rudick said.  Traders will also pay attention to the bank's quarterly economic projections.  ADMISI's Ostwald expects the dot plot – a graphical representation of policymakers' interest-rate projections – to signal a peak of around 5.37% from 5.125% in December. Ostwald also expects the Fed to raise growth and inflation forecast and revise estimates for the lower jobless rate.  An upward revision of the peak rate forecast might bring some selling pressure to risky assets, considering the market's expectation for the same has recently declined to 4.8%.  11:43 UTC: Attributes GSR's quotes to the firm's senior strategist Brian Rudick.

42412580,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5O6o,1679384384,Dfyn Version 2 Goes Live With On-Chain Limit Orders and Enhanced DEX Security,"Multichain decentralized exchange (DEX) Dfyn on Tuesday released its version 2, which makes enhancements to security, trading features and order matching, developers told CoinDesk.  The new version features dedicated vault contracts to protect against liquidity pool exploits, which have accounted for upward of $300 million in user losses since the start of this year.  These vault contracts will store and handle all user funds as opposed to storing them in pool contracts. The vault allows users to borrow tokens through a Flash Loan mechanism, also known as a One Block Borrow, where they can borrow a certain amount of tokens, given that they pay them back before the end of the same transaction.  ""The technology we’ve developed eliminates the challenges of impermanent loss and liquidity mining, which will enable us to scale and create an inclusive multi-chain [decentralized finance] ecosystem with a feature-rich, easy-to-use DEX at the heart of it,"" Ramani Ramachandran, co-founder of Dfyn, told CoinDesk.  Limit orders currently available on DEXs are centralized and prone to hacks and manipulation from bad actors who sell order book flow to high-frequency traders. Decentralized limit orders solve these issues by matching trades at the exact prices between users transparently via the use of smart contracts.  Dfyn will offer concentrated liquidity on individual ticks, resulting in better security and enhanced price precision. Each tick corresponds to a specific price and liquidity, enabling users to add liquidity at a precise price, similar to how order book exchanges operate.  Version 2 also gives users access to Signal, a smart contract-based order routing system that finds the optimal trade path – or the steps taken to execute a trade – when users swap two assets. This gives users access to the best trades, which are highly capital-efficient, and the best prices, guaranteeing minimum slippage and no maximal extractable value (MEV) risk.  MEV is sometimes referred to as an “invisible tax” that miners can collect from users – essentially, the maximum value a miner can extract from moving around transactions when producing a block on a blockchain network.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/21/dfyn-version-2-goes-live-with-on-chain-limit-orders-and-enhanced-dex-security,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b5ce873e9ef1da7645773193cc37959ea19a802-4800x3188.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Decentralized marketplace Clober is letting traders purchase puts on ARB with strike prices of 50 cents, $1, $2, $4, $8 and $16. These have cumulatively seen over $50,000 in trading volumes in the past 24 hours after issuance.  Put options are a type of option that increases in value as the price of the underlying asset, such as a token or equity, falls.  “$ARB $2 put options are sold for 54 cents,” Clober said Tuesday. “By paying 54 cents, you can buy the right to sell your $ARB tokens for $2 at any time within 24 hours of claiming your $ARB airdrop.”  “That guarantees $1.46 of profit per $ARB on claim day,” Clober added.  The put options have an expiry date of March 24, or a day after the claim event. This effectively means the options allow traders to bet on the first-day price action of ARB when trading goes live.  ARB price action is expected to be significantly volatile on the first day. Arbitrum developers confirmed last week that ARB will be airdropped to community members on Thursday, March 23, based on their prior network activity, marking Arbitrum’s official transition into a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).  While the tokens have been much awaited in investor circles for gaining exposure to the Arbitrum ecosystem, the first day of trading might see dynamic price action as some holders dump their tokens to take “free” profits, while others take longer term positions.  The spot tokens are not claimable or actively traded on any exchange as of Tuesday, but futures products offered by the likes of Hotbit and BitMEX are already trading millions of dollars' worth each day, as CoinDesk reported.  ARB futures are seeing a lot of volatility. Hotbit’s Arbitrum IOU tokens have fallen 32% in the past 24 hours, per CoinGecko data, after reaching highs of $12 on Monday night.

Analysis by crypto services provider Matrixport shows that American buyers are leading the safe haven bid for the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has rallied by over 40% in the last 10 days, reaching a nine-month high above $28,000, CoinDesk data shows.  ""Since the dip on March 10, Bitcoin has rallied by +44%. +31% of the rally was driven during the U.S. trading hours and an indicator that Americans are buying bitcoins with both hands,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy, said in a note to clients, adding that the stress in the banking sector is not over.  Bitcoin is available to trade 24/7 worldwide. However, price action varies through each 24-hour cycle depending on the news flow and macroeconomic data releases.  Of late the news flow has been dominated by banking sector issues in the U.S. and the resulting repricing of interest rate expectations lower. That explains bitcoin's positive performance during U.S. trading hours.  American hours have been a major source of bullish pressure since the beginning of the year, according to Matrixport.  ""Bitcoin (BTC) is up +66% year to date, and during U.S. trading hours bitcoin rallied 47% while the cryptocurrency only rallied by +16% during trading hours in Asia.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is starting the Asia trading day in the red for the first time in a while.  Insights: The crypto venture capital industry is experiencing a mini bull market.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,188 −16.2 ▼ 1.3% Bitcoin (BTC) $28,006 +63.9 ▲ 0.2% Ethereum (ETH) $1,760 −17.1 ▼ 1.0% S&P 500  3,951.57 +34.9 ▲ 0.9% Gold  $1,982 +12.4 ▲ 0.6% Nikkei 225  26,945.67 −388.1 ▼ 1.4% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Is Bitcoin’s Rally Coming to an End?  Good morning, Asia, here’s how the markets are beginning the East’s trading day.  Bitcoin is beginning the trading day in the red, down 0.63% to $27,805. Ether is down 2.5% to $1,741.  The big question on everyone’s mind is, of course, interest rates.  In a recent note, Goldman Sachs Chief Economist David Mericle said the U.S. Federal Reserve will pause interest rate hikes because of stress on the banking system.  “While policymakers have responded aggressively to shore up the financial system, markets appear to be less than fully convinced that efforts to support small and midsize banks will prove sufficient,” Mericle wrote. “We think Fed officials will therefore share our view that stress in the banking system remains the most immediate concern for now.”  Delphi Digital co-founder Tom Shaughnessy says the market is giving off mixed signals. While many say the possibility of the Fed pausing rate hikes is a bullish signal for bitcoin, the reality might be something else entirely.  “The data suggests that once the Fed stops raising or pivots, that’s historically when markets sell off,” he said on a recent CoinDesk TV appearance. “I think the rally is less about the Fed pausing and more about liquidity pressures or surpluses there.”  Data from CryptoQuant might back up Shaughnessy’s thesis. Its Adjusted Output Profit Ratio gauge, which tracks the profitability of HODLers, shows that more investors are selling at a profit. In the middle of a bull market, this can indicate a market top.  At the same time, its Net Unrealized Profit and Loss shows that investors are in an anxiety phase, where they have moderate unrealized profits.  All eyes are going to be on the Fed’s next announcement to see if it's bullish or bearish for bitcoin.

Crypto winter was a harsh and cold one for venture capital deals. A report from CoinDesk in January painted a bleak picture for VC activity: down 91% year over year.  But spring has sprung, and crypto is once again rallying. The macroeconomic environment has gone a little weird, and bitcoin has $30,000 in its sights.  Crypto VC funding is coming right back with it.  Data from CryptoRank.io shows that a rebound is taking place.  “Despite the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market, venture capitalists remain undeterred and continue to pour significant investments into the industry, recognizing its immense potential for long-term growth,” CryptoRank’s analyst team said in a note prepared for CoinDesk.  CryptoRank’s analysts say the VC market’s confidence is reinforced by the substantial increase in the number of funding rounds observed in recent months, which the analysts say indicates the burgeoning interest and optimism within the industry.  “Many funds reported losses in 2022 and now have to reduce their investment activity,” the analysts said in their note. “Other VCs, which were more cautious in their investments last year, are now taking the opportunity to use the preserved capital.  Banking will remain a challenge  In the days before Silvergate’s collapse, bitcoin was stuck between Silvergate and China. The impending loss of crypto’s go-to bank dragged down prices, adding sell pressure, while the China narrative of Hong Kong relaxing regulations on institutional and retail trading pulled it up.  And then the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) happened, with a major money print from the Fed.  Risk assets are suddenly back in play.  Banking remains a challenge but other financial institutions are stepping up to the plate, some of which are outside of the U.S. and out of reach of its regulatory regime.  For VCs, this is a separate and unique issue; they need a bank familiar with the sector. Crypto and tech startups as well as small VC funds are turned down by many banks because they are deemed as not worth the risk.  “The problem has far wider implications than the temporary depegging of stablecoins. We expect to see a decline in VC activity, which will have a knock-on effect on crypto fundraising,” the analysts wrote in their note. “SVB provided one of the most popular banking infrastructures for VC investors. Now they will have to look for new opportunities, but the pressure on crypto-friendly banks is a significant red flag.”  This might be Singapore’s time to shine. It’s understood that banks with U.S. dollar (USD) rails will step up and fill the gap. DBS is thought to be a contender, given that it runs a crypto exchange. Or, it might be something entirely different.  “VC fundraising for crypto is driven by a younger generation of alternative fund managers breaking away from TradFi institutions to raise their own capital in Asia,” said Katherine Ng, managing director of TZ APAC, Asia’s leading Tezos blockchain Incubator.  For now, U.S. banks still dominate the sector and have outsized influence on all regions. But it could be time for other institutions to step up.

42412562,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5Nue,1679359326,Crypto Trading Firm Auros Secures $17M Investment as It Recovers From FTX Woes,"Crypto trading and market making firm Auros, a victim of crypto exchange FTX’s bankruptcy, has overcome its liquidity struggles, Chief Investment Officer Benjamin Roth told CoinDesk in an interview.  Auros was released from a court-supervised provisional liquidation last week after a major debt restructuring, and secured a $17 million fresh investment led by traditional high-frequency trading company Vivienne Court Trading and public bitcoin mining company Bit Digital (BTBT).  The turn of events comes after months of behind-the-scenes maneuvering to keep the firm running following the implosion of crypto exchange FTX, which wiped out multiple crypto firms and caused painful losses at some trading companies.  Before the FTX crash, Auros was among the top 10 to 15 digital asset market makers, handling about 1% to 2% of the total crypto trading volume, according to the company. The firm encountered liquidity troubles in November when some $20 million of its digital assets were stuck on now-defunct FTX and Auros missed payments on some $18 million of decentralized finance (DeFi) loans.  After filing for provisional liquidation on the British Virgin Islands, the firm spent about five months under court supervision negotiating how to repay its outstanding debt and make its creditors whole. Roth said the company is leaving the FTX shock behind.  “We're the same company that we were pre-FTX,” he said.  Read more: These Crypto Market Makers Were Wary of FTX Before Collapse  Navigating FTX fallout  After FTX imploded, and as fear among market participants mounted about a full-blown insolvency crisis in crypto, lenders raced to recall outstanding loans to mitigate potential losses. With a significant chunk of funds locked up on FTX, Auros faced a sudden liquidity crunch to repay all of its desperate creditors.  “We were in a position where we didn't have enough liquid funds to meet all of those open term loans,” Roth said.  The Auros management decided not to repay any of the lenders at the time and voluntarily filed for provisional liquidation with the British Virgin Islands (BVI) court as an intermediary between lenders and Auros.  “We weren't paying immediately because our intention was to pay back everything,” according to Roth. “We've been profitable, so it really was just a matter of buying time to ensure that creditors were all treated fairly and equally.”  The BVI assisted in restructuring all outstanding Auros debt, converting outstanding open-term loans – credit lines without a repayment deadline – to termed loans with maturity. As for the some $18 million of DeFi loans, the firm already repaid 55% of its debt on blockchain-based credit platform Maple, and spread the rest to nine-month and three-month loans, CoinDesk reported last month. Roth declined to disclose details about the restructured debt to centralized lenders citing contractual obligations.  Auros received the sealed court order from the BVI judge terminating the provisional liquidation process last Wednesday, according to the firm’s spokesperson.  Auros ran a lean business, cognizant that crypto markets have been cyclical, but Roth said he was “laser-focused” on finding additional cost savings in recent months.  The firm’s main cost-cutting measure was dramatically reducing Amazon Web Service costs and rethinking data center management – trading businesses need extensive cloud computing capacity to run trading algorithms – to rein in operational costs. It also eliminated staff redundancies and laid off some workers. The firm currently employs about 55 people globally.  Strategic investment  Roth said that before FTX’s fall, Auros was already prepared to raise capital, and that the court supervision complicated the fundraising efforts. “It accelerated the requirement to raise but slowed the process because every decision had to go through the provisional liquidators,” he said.  The investment by Vivienne Court means the Australia-based traditional trading firm will have exposure to digital asset trading.  “They were not in crypto, and they were thinking of getting into crypto,” Roth said about the investment.  Marcel Klooss, co-founder of Vivienne Court, said in a statement that ""our two firms have complementary skill sets and unique attributes that will generate sustained synergies.""  The second-largest investor, the Nasdaq-listed BitDigital, will double as a client and strategic partner for the new derivatives solutions business Auros is expanding to provide yield and protection offerings to clients. For BitDigital and other miners that manage a large treasury of cash and digital assets such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), Auros will help them hedge on forward production and earn high yields on their holdings by creating options structures.  ""The team’s deep derivatives background and expertise across technology and finance also bring the necessary capabilities to cater to our growing business needs,"" Samir Tabar, Bit Digital's chief strategy officer, said in a statement.  Other investors in the round include asset manager and blockchain tech developer Trovio, venture capital investment firm Primal Capital, trading firm Epoch Capital and a group of senior and former traders of proprietary trading and market making firm Optiver.  Marcel Klooss and Bit Digital's co-founder Hughes Ching will join Auros’ board of directors.  Auros’ capital raise comes as investments into crypto businesses have mostly evaporated following a year-long bear market.  The investment round was important as Roth expects consolidation in the crypto industry this year.  “A lot of small players will just disappear,” Roth said. “It's not easy out there to make money at the moment, even if you are big and sophisticated.”  UPDATE (March 21, 1:00 UTC): Added details and comments about the investment.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/21/crypto-trading-firm-auros-secures-17m-investment-as-it-recovers-from-ftx-woes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0e606bf82601067c85c534cb24d2285a3c4f34c7-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
