42382394,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXoJ,1564005608,Ripple Sells $251 Million in XRP in Q2 Amid Spike in Institutional Buying,"Ripple's second-quarter report released Wednesday came with a few surprises: a gain, a loss, and a new partner.  The distributed ledger technology firm's total sales of XRP increased by nearly 48 percent to $251 million in the quarter, outpacing the first quarter’s $169 million in sales.  Direct institutional sales drove the uptick, increasing nearly 73 percent to $107.9 million from $61.9 million. Though programmatic sales still accounted for the majority of sales volumes with $144.6 million made in the second quarter up from $107 million in the first.  Despite this growth, the company states in a forward-looking projection:  “Ripple plans to take a more conservative approach to XRP sales in Q3.""  The company plans to pull back from certain over-the-counter exchange markets to focus on where liquidity is most needed, which may negatively impact institutional direct sales. Likewise, Ripple will target programmatic sales at 10 basis points of their lowered trading volumes.  According to the report, Ripple's global trading volumes dropped 28 percent quarter over quarter, from $595 million to $429.5 million, though that's the result of better accounting rather than failed business strategy. In June, mid-way through the second quarter, Ripple changed its benchmark for trading volumes. The firm announced it has worked with data and indices firm CryptoCompare to weed out previously inflated statistics.  CryptoCompare CEO Charles Hayter said his firm uses “granular trade and order book data, rather than aggregate volumes.” Previously, Ripple reported publicly available data from CoinMarketCap. As a result, much of the information in the new report is difficult to compare to previous quarters, as the data were based on different – perhaps illegitimate – metrics.  For instance, without filtering ""a majority of unverified volumes,"" Ripple's global trading figures stand at nearly 1.8 billion, per CoinMarketCap, a 195 percent increase from the first quarter's $595 million. It is unclear whether Ripple will update previous quarter's reports reflecting its new data standards.  Ripple did not respond to a request for clarification.  The report also states the platform's native currency saw a price increase of nearly 25 percent quarter over quarter, landing on $0.40, expanded to 12 new exchanges, and experienced an average of 5 percent volatility in daily returns.  Ripple also released one billion XRP each month of the quarter out of escrow, and replaced 2.1 billion XRP in new contracts. The 900 million in outflow went to develop projects for Xpring and RippleNet’s partnership with MoneyGram.  As previously reported, Ripple purchased $30 million in MoneyGram stock and will develop a solution for international payments for the struggling remittances firm.

FBG shares our vision.”  With the investment, FBG and Landscape have committed to help Dapp.com open doors with other companies in their respective portfolios, which include MakerDAO, Terra, Celer Network and others.

""I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”  While Mnuchin’s comments today do not elucidate his specific regulatory policies, he said previously that cryptocurrencies pose “risk to the financial system” if misused like Swiss bank accounts.  To prevent financial crime or monetary distortion, the Secretary has called upon the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to design guidance that will hold cryptocurrencies to the highest standards.  Today he added, ""We’re going to make sure we have a unified approach and my guess is that there are going to be more regulations that come out from all these agencies.""  On July 18, Mnuchin erroneously claimed that fiat currencies are not vehicles for money laundering, while “there are billions of dollars of transactions going on in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes.”  Several media outlets – including Squawk Box anchor Joe Kernan, at the time – responded with incredulity. Tom Robinson, CEO of research firm Elliptic, wrote an OpEd for VentureBeat claiming, “Less than 0.5 percent of bitcoin transactions are used for illicit purchases.”  While Mnuchin seems to think crypto's future is bleak, he continues to bat for the U.S. dollar.

""Use of malicious cryptominers — cybercriminals’ overwhelming tool of choice in 2018 — has declined to just 15 percent of malware attacks, with ransomware, botnets and backdoors rising to fill the void,” wrote the organization. “Vulnerabilities in cloud containers have increased by 46 percent compared to the same period in 2018 and by 240 percent compared to 2017.”  Crypto mining malware like “Nansh0u campaign” has infected tens of thousands of computers, forcing desktop computers to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies via distributed control systems. This software focused on attacking healthcare, media, and IT companies and Guardicore Labs said that some software infected ""700 new victims a day.”  The popular new attack vector, however, is cloud containers. These remote services powered by providers like Amazon and Google are often unattended and can be used to process the massive amounts of data needed to mine cryptocurrencies. What’s worse, hackers can replicate these containers instantly, creating a virtual army of zombie machines.  “Cloud technology and adoption has obviously skyrocketed, so it’s no surprise that vulnerabilities within cloud technology will increase,” said Marina Kidron of Skybox. “What is concerning, though, is that as these are published, the race is on for attackers to develop an exploit because launching a successful attack on a container could have much broader consequences. Compared to other technology, containers can be more numerous and quickly replicated. The attack footprint could expand rapidly, and number of victims may be extremely high.”  Unfortunately, vulnerabilities are growing. Skybox reported that companies will be “drowning in the vulnerability flood for some time.”  “More than 7,000 new vulnerabilities were discovered in the first half of 2019 — that’s still significantly more than figures we’d see for an entire year pre-2017,” the company wrote. Further, because these attacks cost compute cycles they can run up huge bills for victims, further adding financial injury to the attacks.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,John Biggs,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/24/desktop-crypto-mining-malware-is-disappearing-but-cloud-computing-exploits-are-growing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/47ccc66f5c6894c604f9dba63a76866c92f528a2-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In the poll of 1,799 U.S. adults carried out since Facebook's white paper launch in mid-June, consumer insights provider CivicScience found that, of those that expressed a view, just 2 percent felt they would trust Libra and its Calibra wallet more than bitcoin.  By comparison, a hefty 40 percent said they'd trust the public cryptocurrency more, while 19 percent said they'd trust both options about the same.  From the surveyed group, less than 10 percent had actually bought cryptocurrencies, CivicScience pointed out.  Facebook's poor track record on preserving user privacy, such as with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, was also evident in the results, with 77 percent saying they did not trust the firm with their personal data at all. Again, just 2 percent said they'd trust Facebook a lot.  The lack of trust in Libra is also backed up by overwhelming lack of interest in the project, the poll indicates. When asked if they were interested in Facebook's crypto and wallet, 86 percent of respondents said not at all. Around 5 percent expressed interest.  CivicScience said that people in the 18-to-24 age range had showed the most interest (30 percent) in Libra. They also polled as more keen Facebook users and had more experience with mobile payment apps such as Venmo and Apple Pay.  The next biggest age group was those in the 25-29 range, of whom 18 percent expressed interest. Only 7 percent of the 65-plus group had any interest in Libra.  CivicScience said more research is needed to understand the high levels of mistrust towards the Facebook crypto. However, it said:  ""Similar to when Bitcoin first mysteriously surfaced ten years ago and brought with it the cryptocurrency gold rush, no one really knows what to expect when some of the largest corporations in the world collaborate to create their own version. Regardless, it’s definitely an exciting trend to watch unfold.""  Looking more broadly, a different CivicScience survey of more than 2,100 U.S. adults in July found that a sizable 79 percent have heard of bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.  However, it found that most respondents aren’t holding or using crypto and aren’t planning to. The firm said just 6 percent of those polled had invested in cryptocurrency, with half liking the experience.

42382398,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rXtL,1563972605,PUBG Players Can Get Crypto Rewards for Winning Games This Summer,"Crypto game marketing startup Refereum says it has secured a partnership with major Fortnite competitor, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG).  The partnership will reward PUBG players with RFR tokens. The startup tells CoinDesk it is supplying the RFR tokens for the initial campaign.  ""PUBG has granted Refereum special access to the PUBG login system, and we've tightly integrated our quest technology into the game through access to their production API,"" Dylan Jones, Refereum CEO, told CoinDesk.  The initial campaign will last till Aug. 20. During that time, PUBG players will able to earn rewards on PUBG by logging directly into the game and accomplishing achievements, such as winning matches. The firm says it has previously offered its rewards on games such as State of Decay 2, Fortnite, Apex Legends, and the Battlefield series.  The firm, which says it raised $32 million in a private token sale in early 2018, created its RFR token to better align game makers, streamers and players in the promotion and viewing of compelling new games.  Game companies want influential people to play their games on streaming platforms like Twitch, and they also want players to watch those streams. Refereum argues that rewards can help, and that logging these rewards on the blockchain makes them more transparent and fair.  PUBG is one of the arena-style games competing with Fortnite. It has roughly 350,000 players per day on Steam, according to Steam Charts.  Jones said:  ""PUBG is the perfect example of a game that wants to reward its hardcore following. Utilizing blockchain to do so helps them tap into their entire playerbase of influencers with micropayments, no matter their size, instead of rewarding only the biggest names.""  So what can players do when they've earned RFRs? Refereum says the token can be used for purchases of games, or in-game items such as weapons or skins, as well as to tip their favorite streamers.  Refereum is not the only company to enter the game promotion space. Russia-based, ICO-funded startup The Abyss has a deal with Epic Games (the maker of Fortnite) to use its promotion technology to foster more development on Epic's Unreal Engine.

The news means that the cryptocurrency can be used to pay for purchases in nearly all of its 80 served nations.  The firm first started offering bitcoin payments back in July 2014, soon after expanding the option to Canada.  “Five years ago, we were one of the first major online shopping destinations to accept Bitcoin, and our early-adopter customers were quick to embrace this new payment option,” said Anthony Chow, Newegg President Global Sales.  Opening up the service to another 73 countries ""underscores our commitment to bring innovation to the online shopping experience, and answers customers’ growing preference for our Bitcoin payment option.”  The bitcoin payments are made possible through Newegg's partnership with blockchain payments provider BitPay.  Sonny Singh, chief commercial officer at BitPay, said in the announcement:  “Bitcoin allows users to send and receive money just as easy as sending an email, opening up opportunities for businesses and consumers globally as a secure, low-cost transactional option for the merchants. Newegg was among the first companies to see this opportunity and has continued to expand its Bitcoin acceptance to nearly all of its customers around the world.”  Newegg added that using BitPay allows it to increase its margin on each bitcoin transaction by avoiding credit card fees.

Kelly, Jr.  In a Q3 2019 earnings call on Tuesday, Kelly responded to a question on his firm's involvement with the Libra project from Bryan C. Keane, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.  Keane asked, ""Just wanted to ask on Facebook's Libra, there's some confusion in the market on how to think about that. Is it a strategic partner for Visa or potential disruptive threat? Just curious your thoughts and level of expected Visa involvement in Facebook Libra.""  Playing down the firm's involvement with Libra, Kelly responded that ""it's important to understand the facts.""  He continued:  ""So we have signed a nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra. We're one of – I think it's 27 companies that have expressed that interest. So, no one has yet officially joined.""  The Libra Association’s group of 28 launch partners includes Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Uber, Lyft, Coinbase and others.  “Implied in this project is that wherever the Visa or Mastercard logo are accepted, Libra would follow suit,” Dante Disparte, head of policy and communications for the Libra Association, told CoinDesk at the time. “In so many ways it’s a great leap forward for cryptocurrencies and, in many respects, a mainstreaming of this asset class.”  Going forward, the decision to fully join Facebook's cryptocurrency project would be decided by a ""number of factors, including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements,"" Kelly said.  As suggested, since its release of a Libra white paper in mid-June, Facebook has been defending itself from a storm of calls from regulators worldwide for more information on how the scheme would work, amid concerns over what affect it could have on financial stability and users' privacy.  Kelly emphasized in the call that ""it's really, really early days"" and much has still to be finalized regarding Libra. He finished on a positive note for Facebook, however, saying:  ""But obviously, given that we've expressed interest, we actually believe we could be additive and helpful in the association.""

42403117,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeg9L,1563964256,Where in the World Is John McAfee?,"UPDATE (24, July 18:30 UTC): Dominican Republic-based media organization CDN reports authorities at Puerto Plata have detained John McAfee for illegal fire arm possession. McAfee's campaign manager Rob Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Loggia-Ramirez tweeted via McAfee's account, ""John, Janice and his crew are alive and in the process of being released from confinement.""      As bitcoin dips below $10,000 and ice caps melt, only one thing is certain: John McAfee will keep things surprisingly interesting. Most recently, however, noted crypto fan, presidential candidate, potential auto-cannibal, and general wild man McAfee has disappeared. Where did he go?  First, some background. McAfee took to the sea in January 2019, allegedly carrying a number of soldiers, guns, and bottles of booze.  In the intervening months he landed in the Bahamas and then ended up in Cuba. He continued his presidential run from there.  McAfee  then posted this photo on July 19. In the photo we see McAfee and his wife showing proper trigger discipline somewhere on the water. A few minutes later he wrote: ""I Am a presidential candidate with 1.2 mil followers. My crime is not filing tax returns - not a crime. The rest is propaganda by the U.S. government to silence me. My voice is the voice of dissent. If I am silenced, dissent itself will be next.""  The photo features a number of interesting tidbits.  To wit: a single bullet near McAfee's feet.  A DSLR camera with a decidedly exhausted wind guard. This is presumably not the camera that took this picture.  Photos via Twitter.  Performing a CSI-style ""enlarge and enhance"" on the reflective sunglasses showed us little more than the cameraperson in silhouette. Further, the photo itself holds no clues. In fact, the EXIF and location data is completely bare, something that is not particularly unusual for Twitter photos.  Image via MetaPicz  We know, however, that the McAfee crew was somewhere at sea after leaving Cuba. Janice McAfee confirmed this on July 14.  Over the next three days he sent a few more messages including this one that suggested he was coming back into port.  And then...  These messages, sent by McAfee's campaign manager, Rob Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Loggia-Ramirez, suggest that McAfee and crew are gone. McAfee, a born entertainer, could have disappeared for effect in order to rile up speculation or he could be in U.S. (??) custody.  We've reached out to McAfee's campaign manager and haven't yet heard back. However, he did send a message to Law & Crime stating: “People won’t believe it, but the information that I posted under John’s account is all that I have. John has a lot of friends all over the world, and we are all working to locate him and secure his release if necessary.”  What's the old saying? If your pirate friends don't know where you are, things may be bleak.  McAfee is a seminal figure in the story of crypto. While he may be wacky - this drink in particular seems a little gin-heavy and he's a shill for many dubious projects - his antics are a direct reflection on the current state of the ecosystem just as the original (and grumpy) gurus like Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds defined the free and open source software ecosystem. Folks like McAfee paint a different - and sometimes controversial - picture of the future of this technology. It's worth listening to them... and worrying about them.

42403122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeg6O,1563963321,Bitcoin Faces Further Price Losses After Breaching Long-Term Support,"Bitcoin is on the defensive for the fourth straight day, having breached long-term support on Tuesday.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $9,720, representing a 1.1 percent drop from today's opening price of $9,841, according to Bitstamp data. Prices fell 1.39, 2.56 and 4.66 percent, respectively in the previous three trading days.  Daily chart  With a three-day drop, BTC has left another bearish lower high at $11,120. Further, the cryptocurrency violated the four-month bullish rising trendline by printing a UTC close well below $10,000 on Tuesday.  As a result, a drop to the July 17 low of $9,049 in the short-term cannot be ruled out.  Such a drop would hardly be surprising, given the bounce from that level to weekend's high of $11,120 was accompanied by falling volumes, as discussed yesterday.  So far, the downside has been restricted around $9,650, meaning the support at $9,614 (July 2 low) is still intact.  However, that level could be breached soon as key daily chart indicators like the moving average convergence divergence histogram indicating the bearish momentum is gathering strength.  The case for a drop toward $9,650 would weaken if prices rise above $10,222, invalidating a bearish lower highs pattern on the 4-hour chart. That said, a UTC close above $11,100 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal.

The project appears to be an attempt to tie up almost the whole rental business in one smartphone app. CNET Japan reported Tuesday that the firms plan to develop a ""one-stop shop,"" allowing users to search for properties, make bookings, sign contracts and payment different expenses, as well as providing contract renewal and exiting procedures.  As for benefits, bitFlyer and Sumitomo say that the app would use smart contracts on a blockchain to improve the efficiency of the rental business, lowering costs and speeding up the process of signing up to lease a property.  BitFlyer Blockchain is a subsidiary of bitFlyer Holdings set up earlier this year, and a sister firm to the cryptocurrency exchange of the same name.  Ultimately, the plan is to expand the services offered to related contractual services outside property rental, such as offered by guarantors and insurance companies. As insurance and guarantees are mandatory, they expect the services to be gradually digitized along side the lease aspect of the industry.  The planned app currently would match-make between the lessee and the property management company, or an intermediary. By digitizing the contract process, all parties are able to verify the process from first enquiry to the contract signing in a timely manner, the report says.  Further, details of the parties would be stored on the system for later contract deals, and associated with rating or credit information.  Yuzo Kano, managing director of bitFlyer Blockchain, said the app would usher in ""a world where everything from browsing to contract is completed with a smartphone.""  It will ""greatly simplify"" the real-estate rental contract process ""significantly reduce"" administrative costs, he said.

The Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC) had requested further details on Libra to assist in its oversight of the planned crypto project.  “The FDPIC is currently waiting for the Libra Association to respond to [its] letter of 17 July 2019 and set out their official position,” the agency said in a statement Tuesday.  When Libra was unveiled in mid June, it was announced that the Libra Association, set up to develop and manage the stablecoin, had been formed in Switzerland and Facebook's Libra lead, David Marcus, told a U.S. Senate hearing earlier in July that the FDPIC is expected to be the project's privacy regulator.  The FDPIC said soon after the Senate hearing that the lack of contact from the social media giant about Libra had prompted it to send the letter.  Among the expected details on Libra, the commissioner said it was expecting an impact assessment of risks around data protection, as well as an evaluation of the risks and proposed countermeasures.  The watchdog said:  “The FDPIC stated in its letter that as it had not received any indication on what personal data may be processed, the Libra Association should inform it of the current status of the project so that the FDPIC could assess the extent to which its advisory competences and supervisory powers would apply.”  The FDPIC is not alone in wanting to know more about Facebook's plans for Libra and its potential risks.  Numerous regulators worldwide, including the finance chiefs of the G7 nations, have called for further information to be released, amid fears the cryptocurrency could be used for money laundering and could pose a threat to financial stability.  The G7 said that rules of the highest standard would be required to minimize the use of digital currencies in money laundering and funding terrorism  Further, a U.K. parliamentary committee said this week that it may probe Facebook on Libra, as the company's poor track record on protecting privacy could pose a threat to the financial data of its billions of users.

42403101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdeftb,1563955370,"Civic, BitGo Announce a Consumer Mobile Wallet","Decentralized identity startup Civic Technologies announced a partnership with BitGo to build a crypto wallet that maintains anonymity while offering a back-up solution.  The eponymously named Civic Wallet was designed alongside Civic Identity, Identity.com, and Civic Pay to operate with BitGo’s multisig solution.  Civic will store minimal user data, in the form of KYC information, for account recovery and compliance purposes only. The firm will not share this information with BitGo, but relies on the cryptographic storage company to retain redundant client signatures.  BitGo primarily deals in enterprise clients, providing a secure hot wallet for institutions that perform a high volume of transactions.  “Civic found a way to leverage the multisig commodity to work at the consumer level,” said Ben Chan, CTO of BitGo.  This retail level wallet starts off with the bare essentials. It “will launch with a handful of currencies familiar to the digital community” and allow users “to store, send and receive cryptocurrency,” said a Civic representative.  The firm believes its scaled down wallet will be attractive to those less familiar with cryptocurrencies. The company also provides a number of features reminiscent of traditional bank accounts, like daily limits – a security feature in case of identity theft – privacy controls, and recoverability. Additionally, keys are stored on the mobile device, to simplify login.  When onboarding to the wallet, the firm will authenticate clients’ identities through blockchain technology. Though a solution from Identity.com, which Civic purchased in 2018, a “decentralized identification verification system allows users to opt in to sharing their underlying data with people they choose,” said Chan.  Civic plans to release the wallet in the fourth quarter of 2019. In April, the startup partnered with 12 vending machine providers to bring age verification and identification solutions to retail locations without human vendors.  Civic held a $33 million token sale in 2017 to build out a decentralized attestations platform.

Published Tuesday, a new website for the publisher's News Provenance Project explains how the storied newspaper's Research and Development team plans to use Hyperledger Fabric’s permissioned blockchain to authenticate news photographs in partnership with IBM Garage, the tech giant's accelerator program.  The project aims to combat misinformation and adulterated media, which it argues harms small and large publishers alike. ""News consumers [who] are deceived and confused...eventually become fatigued and apathetic to news,"" the website says.  The New York Times and partner companies will run a proof-of-concept from July until late 2019 to find a way to maintain trust in digital files. The project aims to store a news item’s “contextual metadata” on a blockchain, including when and where a photo or video was shot, who took it and information regarding how it was edited and published.  The idea is to create a “set of signals that can travel with published media anywhere that material is displayed,"" the website says, including on social media, in group chats and in search results.  The Times plans to publish updates on the project throughout the process, culminating in a full report following the pilot's conclusion.  Additional confirmation came via a tweet from Civil Media CEO Vivian Schiller, who was formerly with the New York Times, and a lengthy Medium post from Sasha Koren, the program's project lead.
