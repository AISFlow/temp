Draper had first gotten into bitcoin in 2011 when Peter Vincennes had convinced him to buy the digital asset. Draper had bought $250,000 worth of BTC, which he subsequently lost after the now-defunct Mt. Gox exchange crashed, where Draper had kept his coins. Despite this, the billionaire was not deterred. So when another opportunity presented itself in the form of U.S. Marshalls auctioning off bitcoins seized from criminals, Draper took advantage of this opportunity. At the auction, Draper had bought 29,656 bitcoins at $632 apiece, which had totaled $18.74 since the coins were sold for $14 above the going rate on exchanges.

Draper Predicts Bitcoin At $250,000 By 2022 The first time the billionaire had made this prediction had been in 2018. Back then, the price of the digital asset was still trading below $10,000, so this did not seem as believable as it might be today. But Draper never faltered on his prediction. The driving factor behind this prediction has been that the billionaire believes bitcoin will become an accepted mode of payment everywhere.

The massive price appreciation is driven by a growth in the LUNA ecosystem and an increase in demand for its stablecoin UST.

The SEC accused BitConnect, a global operation that used a network of commission-based promoters to sell $2 billion worth of its native cryptocurrency token to retail investors, of being a Ponzi scheme. Investors were promised up to 40% return on their investment, which BitConnect promised to generate using a non-existent “volatility software trading bot.”  Instead of investing client funds, the SEC alleges BitConnect and Kumbhani “siphoned investors’ funds off for their own benefit by transferring those funds to digital wallet addresses controlled by them, their top promoter in the U.S., defendant Glenn Arcaro, and others.”  Several other BitConnect promoters have already faced civil lawsuits from the SEC for receiving millions in commission for their role in the alleged fraud.  Kumbhani and Arcaro had not, until today, been charged for their relationship to BitConnect’s alleged scam.

42413876,QGYAr3uO7Twscje5zZXKTO,1630528517,Market Wrap: Ether Breaks Out as Bitcoin Lags,"Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, broke out of a monthlong consolidation on Wednesday and looks poised to continue higher. Bitcoin, meanwhile, was trading at around $48,600 at press time and is up about 3% over the past 24 hours, compared with an 8% rise in ETH over the same period.  “Ethereum’s blockchain activity is bullish, indicating the second leg of the bull run is close,” Alexandra Clark, a trader at U.K.-based digital asset broker GlobalBlock, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “The recent spike in NFT (non-fungible token) activity has prompted a rise in transaction volume and active addresses on the Ethereum network, as well as a deflationary supply,” Clark wrote.  For bitcoin, analysts are watching for a potential increase in trading volume, which has been on the decline over the past month, to confirm support above $46,000 and $48,000.  Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $48,243, +2.50%  Ether (ETH) $3,724, +9.45%  S&P 500: +0.0%  Gold: $1,814, -0.0%  10-year Treasury yield closed at 1.302%, -0.003 percentage point  Ether takes the lead  Ether’s share of the total crypto market capitalization has been rising since 2019, and is now just below 20%. The increase in market share could solidify Ethereum’s place in the crypto ecosystem as a top smart contract platform.  Analysts at Delphi Digital wrote in a Tuesday blog post that if support holds near $3,500, ETH could be primed for takeoff. Delphi also noted that September could be a seasonally weak period for cryptocurrencies, but a positive fourth quarter could make up for any short-term pullbacks.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens have also caught a bid as some traders rotate out of ETH in search of higher return potential.  “The 20-month long trend of investors withdrawing ETH from exchanges and pushing them into smart contracts has continued,” Delphi Digital wrote. The chart below shows the recent outperformance of DeFi tokens relative to BTC and ETH.     ETH toward all-time high  From a technical perspective, unlike bitcoin, ether has broken out of a monthlong consolidation phase and is poised to reach an all-time high near $4,000. Further, upside momentum has improved over the past week given the earlier breakout above $3,000. ETH is entering overbought territory, albeit less extreme compared with the beginning of August.  And relative to BTC, ETH is maintaining a strong breakout, which will likely continue this month. The ETH/BTC ratio has support above 0.067 with an initial upside target toward 0.08 resistance.  Blockchain data also shows greater support for ether relative to bitcoin.  There has been roughly 147,759 ETH burned, priced at almost more than $1.5 billion, since the EIP 1559 activation in early August, according to digital asset manager 21 Shares. Meanwhile, older bitcoin wallets have taken some profits near the $50,000 supply zone.  But not all is lost for bitcoin. Overall, “on-chain activity signified a persistent long-term conviction in bitcoin enduring its momentum and reaching higher prices as whales holding100-10,000 BTC have added almost 20,000 to their total holdings coupled with MicroStrategy’s latest top-up,” 21 Shares wrote in a Tuesday newsletter, referring to the software company that bought a lot of bitcoin.  CME bitcoin open interest rises  Open interest in Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) bitcoin futures is approaching $2 billion. It saw steady growth throughout August. That could be a sign of greater institutional interest in bitcoin futures, which is sometimes used to hedge spot BTC exposure.  Last week, the legendary investor Bill Miller’s flagship fund, the Miller Opportunity Trust, disclosed in a regulatory filing that it owned $1.5 million shares in Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).  “These types of investors could be interested in hedging their positions through the CME futures,” Arcane Research wrote in a Tuesday report.  Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.

Gensler reiterated his desire for crypto trading platforms to register with the SEC because a number of cryptocurrencies can be deemed as securities. “Talk to us, come in,” he said.  “There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging. Instead there is a bit of ... begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission.”  Gensler has said previously that he is weighing up more robust regulation of the crypto market, dampening hopes held by many in the industry that his interest in the space may lead to a rather hands-off regulatory approach.

Bitcoin has also found support at the $47k price level, and we might expect a price surge in the entire market as BTC/USDT tried to breach the $49-$50 price levels. If the support at $4.08 holds, the next resistance for C98, according to our Coin98 price analysis, is at $5. The trading value for C98 has fallen by over 7.74 percent, and the coin is ranked at 218. A major price surge was seen in LINK, VET, and ETH today, while C98 is about 51.82 percent below its all-time high at 8.69 USD.

According to the Twitter account Resistencia Activa, which reported the incident, Gómez was arrested on Wednesday morning and taken to the Montserrat police station and then transferred to the Central Investigations Division of the PNC, local newspaper La Prensa Gráfica reported.  The news organization added the police have told Gómez’s lawyers they are investigating Gomez for possible bank fraud, explaining why they confiscated his phones and attempted to confiscate his computer.  Hours later, Gómez was released after it was confirmed that he did not have an arrest warrant and that the police said he had only been captured “in the process of investigation,” his lawyer Otto Flores told La Prensa Gráfica.  PNC did not respond to CoinDesk’s inquiries about the reasons for Gómez’s arrest.  According to PNC, Gómez is accused of financial fraud related to false emails sent to users of the banking system that violated their accounts, added La Prensa Gráfica.  Speaking to local media La Prensa Grafica, Gomez’s mother, Elena de Gomez, confirmed the police detained her son “without a warrant or anything.” Gómez, she added, asked the officers to show documentation of an authorization but they did not do so.  On the way to the jail they took away Gómez’s two cell phones, added his mother, who was asked by a military officer for her son’s computer. The officer withdrew the request due to the presence of media organizations, she said.  Gómez’s last public appearance was yesterday in a Twitter space organized by Diario de Hoy newspaper, where he analyzed the implementation of bitcoin in El Salvador.  El Salvador newspaper (which shares its name with the country) said the Attorney General’s Office (FGR) did not detail the crimes Gómez is accused of committing.  Among his criticisms of the Bukele government and the implementation of the Bitcoin Law in El Salvador, Gomez tweeted that an official presentation of Chivo Wallet on LinkedIn used the same address that Twitter hackers employed when they stole Elon Musk’s account.  “A slide with an address with illicit funds does not help Chivo ehh,” he added.  On Wednesday, small demonstrations against the implementation of bitcoin took place in the country. According to those present on the scene, about 200 people marched to the national parliament and gave some speeches.

In partnership with Sevens Foundation, a non-profit that helps digital artists create and exhibit NFTs, Playboy will choose 50 winning submissions for each series, mint them and promote them on social media.  Submissions for the first in the series, “The Art of Gender and Sexuality,” open today and close Oct. 1. In November, winning artists will have their work showcased at the NFT.NYC conference.  This is not Playboy’s first foray into the NFT space.  In May, the company collaborated with digital artist Slimesunday to release an NFT collection called “Liquid Summer” featuring archival photographs of Playboy model Lenna Sjööblom – the so-called “First Lady of the Internet.”  In August, Playboy posted articles teaching artists how to mint NFTs and laid out the timeline of Playboy’s NFT history dating back to March, when the brand began collecting NFTs with Beeple’s “Bull Run.”  Playboy’s crypto journey  Playboy’s history with bitcoin dates back even further: In 2018, Playboy TV began accepting bitcoin payments. In June, bitcoin payments expanded to Playboy.com.  For Liz Suman, Playboy’s vice president of art curation and editorial, the brand’s interest in crypto and NFTs are a natural fit for a company with a nearly 70-year history of censorship resistance.  “We’ve always been a place that champions art in sometimes controversial ways,” Suman told CoinDesk. “We really see NFTs as the frontier of creative expression going forward.”  Suman told CoinDesk that Playboy’s curatorial panel will prioritize submissions from emerging and underrepresented digital artists, including women and non-binary artists and artists with small social media followings.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | REGULATION | TRADING,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/playboy-is-minting-nfts-on-the-art-of-gender-and-sexuality,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84aa660d482a1bf8e18cf69c4ea173184b0dc2eb-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At least two crypto-focused jobs posted this week – one trader, one researcher – would join the “growing” investments team within Franklin Templeton’s Digital Assets Management division, the listings said.  “We are looking for a Crypto Currency [sic] Trader to execute trades for several strategies using the largest, most liquid listed and tradable crypto assets (e.g., BTC, ETH, etc.),” read one.  The twin gigs, which appear to mark Franklin Templeton’s first foray into bitcoin, highlight the $1.5 trillion firm’s newfound interest in crypto as an investable asset class. In late July, it backed a Galaxy Digital fund of funds that chases venture opportunities in the crypto economy.  Franklin Templeton’s planned crypto hires are far more direct, however. The roles will be tasked with executing crypto strategies, building relationships with blockchain developer communities and creating new crypto products for the mutual fund issuer and money manager.  It’s not entirely clear if Franklin Templeton’s crypto trading will be directly involved with the coins. The trading gig calls for experience in derivatives and futures markets, which could indicate a focus on trading regulated bitcoin and ether contracts – as other investment firms have done.

42394440,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvdYf5,1630510422,How NFTs Fit Into DeFi,"However interesting non-fungible tokens (NFT) might be as a new technology, one of their superpowers within the crypto space is they’re not considered securities for regulatory purposes. This frees marketplaces like OpenSea from the burden of becoming a registered broker-dealer, among other constraints. That missing hurdle is certainly a major structural factor underlying the current NFT frenzy.  But financialization has a powerful gravity, especially in crypto. I’ve already written about NFTs that are turning themselves into securities at the design level by adding things like dividends and governance rights.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk’s daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news.  At the same time, the code underlying them, not much different from the structure of a cryptocurrency token, makes it easy to integrate even simple image NFTs into more complex financial products. The most valuable NFTs are already being “fractionalized,” or split up into more affordable chunks for sale to investors, a process that is overseen by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  They could also theoretically be used as collateral for decentralized finance loans or other instruments, but that entails a technical problem. As with a regular loan, you’d have to know a solid price for an NFT to use it as loan collateral, but the NFT market right now is extremely volatile. More fundamentally, how do you value a truly unique object, digital or otherwise?  “If you have a single-asset market, it’s very hard to produce that kind of price transparency and discovery,” says Philipp Pieper, co-founder of Swarm Markets, a German-regulated DeFi protocol focused on tokenized equities in addition to crypto.  The problem is more solvable for NFTs issued in large series, like the CryptoPunks (I’ve written previously about other market advantages of series NFTs). Out of a series of several thousand, Pieper suggests that a few Punks (or lions or apes) could be used as something like a price oracle for the rest of the assets.  “You can create an NFT basket to ETH pair in a liquidity pool,” Pieper explains. “Then you have an aggregated basket that has a market value, and you’re unlocking the whole price discovery problem.”  Of course, CryptoPunks are a good illustration of one challenge to this idea – there are sometimes huge spreads between the lowest and highest prices of items in a series. Punks have recently sold for prices ranging from the low $100Ks to several million.  Pieper says that means some rebalancing, perhaps algorithmic, might be necessary for an NFT oracle pool. “Maybe something changes and one of those punks goes 10x in value. Then you have to be able to extract that to get the 10x value. It would then be unfair to have the other 999 priced on that average.”  That’s not too different from the way index funds and other conventional financial products are managed, and Swarm says it’s working on the problem.  “The tech is pretty much there,” according to Pieper, “but there’s a lot to figure out about pricing and economics.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,David Z.

Gensler addressed crypto assets among other areas of concern in financial services as part of an exchange of views with members of the European Parliament on Wednesday.  The chair of the U.S. markets regulator described crypto as a “$2.1 trillion asset class” that is “truly global.”  “It has no borders or boundaries. It operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” he said.  In reiterating his stance on crypto regulation stated in various recent interviews, Gensler highlighted two broad areas of focus for the SEC: Platforms for crypto trading and lending, and stablecoins.  “Crypto platforms provide direct access to millions of investors,” he said. “There’s no broker between the public and the platform. Therefore, absent clear investor protection obligation on these platforms, the investing public is vulnerable.”  With regard to stablecoins, Gensler pointed to the $116 billion that already exists in a pre-Facebook diem world.  “In July, nearly three-quarters of trading on all crypto trading platforms occurred between a stablecoin and some other token,” Gensler said. “Thus, the use of stablecoins on these platforms may facilitate those seeking to sidestep a host of public policy goals connected to our traditional banking and financial system: anti-money laundering, sanctions, and more.”  Read more: EU Policymakers Propose Tighter Regulation of Crypto Transfers",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Jamie Crawley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/01/sec-chair-gensler-lays-out-crypto-regulation-stance-to-european-parliament,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5cd0db5a9956843a8bfd6941ee0f48277fd18154-1500x996.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price of the SOL token rose 195% in August to $108, and it now has a market value of $33.7 billion, breaking into the ranks of the world’s 10 biggest cryptocurrencies, based on data from Messari and other providers. Just this year, the asset has jumped a staggering 62-fold.  The LUNA token from Terra, another smart-contract blockchain, also nearly tripled in price in August, pushing its market capitalization to about $13 billion.  Among the CoinDesk 20, a curated roster of digital assets, the top performer was Cardano’s ADA token, which doubled in price during the month, followed by Polkadot’s DOT with a 75% return.  All of these top performers in August were members of a group dubbed “Ethereum killers” – so-called layer 1 blockchains offering low fees, enhanced scalability and fast transaction times designed to support applications such as decentralized finance (DeFi) as well as trading in non-fungible tokens (NFT).  The intense speculation comes as Ethereum, the second-largest blockchain overall after Bitcoin, prepares to undergo a major upgrade over the coming year known as Ethereum 2.0.  “We have enormous respect for the Ethereum developer community’s spirit,” Solana Labs CEO Anatoly Yakovenko, told CoinDesk. “It’s been an inspiration to watch, and in many ways laid the blueprint for disintermediating all of the world’s marketplaces, starting with DeFi. We are in the same fight.”  Solana also launched its global five-week Ignition Hackathon on Aug. 31, which will focus on Web 3.0 development, DeFi, gaming and NFTs. While some traders and commenters on Twitter had speculated that the Ignition event implied that a token-burning announcement was imminent, a spokesperson for Solana said the rumor was false.  Solana, backed by investors including Andresseen Horowitz (a16z) and Polychain Capital, was founded in 2017 by Yakovenko and has garnered interest from investors because of its perceived scalability, low transaction costs and fast processing speed.  Ethereum is home to the most active development community among smart-contract blockchains and DeFi activity, as well as the fast-growing OpenSea NFT marketplace. But the network has struggled with congestion and high fees.  “ETH has experienced growing transaction fees amid the NFT frenzy, possibly attracting more users to other chains,” according to a report by Arcane Research. “However, in the DeFi ecosystem overall, Ethereum remains the clear leader, and it seems unlikely that any other protocol will dethrone Ethereum’s position in the near future.”",POSITIVE,ETH | SOL,BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/01/solanas-sol-token-nearly-tripled-in-august-as-investors-bet-on-ethereum-killers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/863c06b1feeff248fba1d74ef2e659a4cad0c9ad-1400x648.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kyber Network said in an announcement on Wednesday the KyberDMM protocol is available for traders, liquidity providers and yield farmers on BSC, along with the “Rainmaker” liquidity-mining campaign, which already runs on Ethereum and Polygon.  Binance Smart Chain is the second-largest blockchain by total value locked, followed by Terra, Polygon and Solana. The top spot is held by Ethereum.  The Rainmaker program will run for two months. It will distribute 2 million KNC tokens, worth $4 million, over the four liquidity pools found on KyberDMM’s yield page: ether-Binance token (ETH-BNB), tether-binance token (USDT-BNB), tether-binance USD and kyber network token-binance token (KNC-BNB).  Users providing liquidity to those pools will receive DMM-LP tokens, representing their share in the pool. These tokens can be staked to earn additional KNC rewards proportional to their share of the pool on top of protocol fees.  Supporting the launch, Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, has listed the BEP-20 version of the KNC token to facilitate deposits and withdrawals from the BSC network. BEP-20 is the Binance Smart Chain token standard created to extend ERC-20.  “Binance Smart Chain has been a popular avenue for DeFi and NFT Dapps and users,” Loi Luu, CEO and co-founder of Kyber Network, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “KyberDMM will provide BSC ecosystem players with a capital efficient and reliable protocol for their liquidity needs and help them maximize their use of capital.”  Launched in early April, KyberDMM ensures capital efficiency by providing amplified liquidity pools and dynamic fees.  KyberDMM allows for the creation of pools with a high amplification factor, where liquidity can be increased without more tokens. That’s possible when the coins in the liquidity pool have low price volatility like the dollar-pegged stablecoins. With dynamic fees, liquidity providers can adjust protocol fees based on market conditions, maximizing returns and reducing impermanent loss arising from volatility in trading pairs.  KyberDMM went live on Ethereum in mid-April and debuted on Polygon on June 30 with a promise to boost liquidity. “Since the launch, total trading volume and total value locked on both networks have exceeded $1 billion and $500 million,” Shane Hong, head of marketing at Kyber Network, told CoinDesk.

42424673,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVkBh,1630500111,The Bored Ape Founders Haven’t Yet Joined the Yacht Club,"It’s now a tech cliche: “They dropped out of college and became startup millionaires.” Yawn. Happens all the time. Until now, however, we’ve never seen anything quite like this: “Dropped out of getting a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Creative Writing and became a crypto millionaire.”  Enter the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). A decade ago, two friends – literary bros – liked to drink beer and shoot the breeze about writers like Hemingway, David Foster Wallace and Wittgenstein. “Gargamel” had an MFA; “Gordon Goner” enrolled in an MFA program but dropped out for health reasons. (Both men, obviously, use pseudonyms.) In 2017, they bought some crypto. For the next two years they stayed on the periphery of the space – watching, learning, lurking, thinking. Gargamel worked as a writer and editor, while Goner was a part-time day-trader.  They mulled over how to get more involved and “join the club” of crypto, but they didn’t see how to crack the door. “I wasn’t the world’s best trader, Gargamel wasn’t the world’s best investor,” says Goner. “We’re not technical guys. We couldn’t be blockchain programmers even if we tried … We’re creatives, right?”  Then came NFTs.  Finally, they could get creative. Finally they had something to contribute. What if we invented some characters? A world? A backstory? A compelling hook? With the help of two friends (“No Sass” and “Emperor Tomato Ketchup”), they hauled in over $2 million in their initial sale of the 10,000-ape non-fungible token (NFT) collection, where the apes went for around $200 a pop. Now that feels like a bargain. Today’s going rate? Just ask NBA star Steph Curry, who bought an ape on Aug. 29 for $180,000 and proudly made it his Twitter profile.  The Bored Apes are now one of the most coveted collections in all of crypto, in the rarefied air of CryptoPunks, with one Sotheby’s listing (of 101 apes) estimated at $12 million on the low end. They’ve spawned countless knockoffs. They even sold $96 million of mutant apes (because of course) in under an hour. The team donated nearly $1 million to animal charities. Perhaps even more satisfying for the literary friends, BAYC was given the imprimatur of that most sacred of publications, The New Yorker, in a 2,500-word profile noting that “Ape avatars are taking over Twitter.”  Gargamel and Goner have quietly, slyly shown the crypto space something profound: the power of an authentic story. Spend any time in a creative writing class, and you’ll hear the word “authenticity” almost as much as the word “organic.” These apes are funny because they come from a weird place of truth. Everyone who has “aped in” to a s**tcoin can relate. Everyone who has spent time on Crypto Twitter can relate.  It’s the ultimate MFA success story. When you can help spur the adoption and evolution of NFTs, who needs to submit short stories to Ploughshares, get politely rejected by The Paris Review or teach fiction classes at college? (Note: These are not specific descriptions of Gargamel or Goner’s writing activities – which remain anonymous – but mere speculation from someone who also has an MFA in creative writing and is also into crypto, but is not exactly a crypto millionaire. Side note to the note: There is zero envy here. None.)  This interview was conducted via Zoom and has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s start with your origin story. How’d this all start?  Gargamel: So we were in our early 20s, and we basically met through friends-of-friends at this kind of grimy bar in Miami. We’d both grown up there, were born and raised there, and that later played into how we imagined the [Ape] club. Fast forward several years, and we were long distance friends on a big group chat, always texting – book recommendations and all that.  When did crypto enter the scene?  Gargamel: In 2017, my brother-in-law was just buying a little bit of ethereum. I had college friends in 2009 who had told me about bitcoin, and I was like, “This is dumb.” The first time you hear about bitcoin you’re like, “This is so stupid.” And the next time you hear about it, the person who told you about it made a shitload of money, and you’re like, “Oh, OK.” And so the third time you hear about it, you buy it.  Hilarious.  Gargamel: And so it was 2017 for me, and I basically texted Gordon, “Hey, let’s buy a little bit of bitcoin and ETH.” And we did. Then all of the sudden we rode that euphoric wave up the top.  How involved were you in the space?  Gargamel: We were immediately on Crypto Twitter. And crypto is a space that rewards your attention. If you’re just keeping your ear to the ground and hearing about everything, it seemed like that was a huge way to gain alpha, to understand what was happening. We were both really in love with all of these Twitter personalities and just learning about crypto.  Goner: We just immersed ourselves into the entire world of crypto, and then slowly but surely became true believers. Crypto, for us, is the future. We’re cultists just like everyone else.  So I got into trading in 2017 and did fairly well, and then got wrecked, like everyone else, with over-leverage. But always in the back of our heads, we wanted to be part of the club. But we didn’t know how, right?  I wasn’t the world’s best trader, Gargamel wasn’t the world’s best investor. We’re not technical guys. We couldn’t be blockchain programmers even if we tried. We’re creatives, right? It’s kind of funny to say it like this, but we really just wanted to join the club, and we didn’t know how. Weirdly, I guess the solution was to make our own club.  And this is when NFTs come in?  Goner: It wasn’t until Hashmasks [one of the original NFT communal digital art projects] that we realized how cool NFTs could be. Gargamel was the one to DM [direct message] me. He’s like, “Hey, look at this. Let’s make an NFT.” And I didn’t remember what NFT meant, because I hadn’t really seen CryptoPunks or CryptoKitties for years. So my response to him was like, “What the f**k is an NFT?”  A lot of people have asked that exact question.  Goner: Then I immediately looked it up, and I’m like, “Yeah, I know what those are.” But I didn’t see what was so cool about it. Then Gargamel was showing me Hashmasks, and I’m thinking, “Wow, this is really looking cool.” It just blew our minds. We immediately went to work thinking up ideas, and we pretty much haven’t stopped since. From that moment on, we’ve basically worked 14 hours a day, building.  What was it about NFTs that lit such a fire?  Gargamel: It just seemed that … Hey, culture is coming to Ethereum. This is what we were waiting for. It felt like the doors were blown open to this whole new space, and as creative people that have been trying to be active – but in the end, quite passive – in interacting with crypto, we thought, here is a way for us to participate in crypto, and actually build something, even if it’s a ridiculous f**king club for apes.  So how’d the idea for the club come about?  Gargamel: We started off thinking, “Okay, what can we do? What do people want? What would be interesting?” And we had some dumb ideas that didn’t go anywhere. You’ve read The New Yorker article. The original idea was pretty artsy-fartsy, to be honest, and frankly not us.  [Note: As The New Yorker piece outlines, one early idea was to create a “shared digital canvas,” where anyone who joins the community can draw on it.]  Gargamel: And Gordon’s friend, who we were talking to, was like, people are gonna draw a d**k on this thing the second it goes up. This is crypto. And that’s exactly what’s gonna happen.  Goner: And that’s the best part of that story, by the way. That was the turning point. I spent all night thinking about what that meant, that there was just going to be this d**k on the wall, as the first thing up. That’s when we came up with Bored Ape Yacht Club. The idea was that it was this place for degenerates to go, right? Because that’s who we were. We were they guys who aped into every f**king s**tcoin. We kind of are that person.  How’d you flesh the idea out?  Goner: We imagined it as, “Where would we go if we could go anywhere?” It was the first time that we stopped thinking about what other people might want. And instead the question became, “What would we want to buy?”  We just went back to our childhoods. And we said, “Oh, let’s put a swamp club in the Everglades, and fill it with apes who are just f**king super ‘80s hardcore and ‘90s hip-hop, and just super weird and crazy, you know?”  But more than anything, they’re just f**king bored, because the yield farms have dried up, and they’re all super rich. It’s 2035 or whenever, and everyone who aped in is just rich beyond their wildest dreams. What do you do then? You just hang out with a bunch of apes and get weird, you know?  There seems to be a kernel of truth in there, of how things work in the crypto space…  Gargamel: We’ve seen it already, which is why it was so interesting. Since 2017, on Twitter, you’d see all these guys who are s**t-posting all day and asking, “Hey, does anyone wanna play a game of League?” You know that these guys, or at least some of them, have hundreds of millions of dollars, and this is what they’re doing. What we’re seeing on Twitter is that the people who understand it – they don’t want to be on South Beach, hanging out with models. They want to be with their friends, in a secret little shitty club in the Everglades.  This could be a stretch, but I’m reminded here of your writing backgrounds. Do you think there’s any parallel between your big conceptual breakthrough – to design NFTs for what interests you, not some “target demo” – and the idea that in writing, sometimes the best stuff comes from channeling what you really want to see, not what some theoretical reader wants?  Goner: Yeah. I think every writer must have that same sort of epiphany at some point in their writing career. At a certain point you realize, you’re not writing to try and impress your professor, or the audience, or the target market, or whatever you had imagined. At a certain point, to borrow a phrase from Gordon Lish, you’re just writing to create that next perfect sentence that delights you.  Love that.  The idea was that it was this place for degenerates to go, right? Because that’s who we were  Gargamel: Ever since the Bored Ape Yacht Club, we’ve seen like 1,000 different avatar collections come up, and a lot of them are really cool. But what we think was special – and what people could kind of read on top of ours – is that we didn’t just throw 3D glasses onto apes. And we didn’t have a long essay on what exactly what this was. But we knew what it was. It’s like Wittgenstein’s “let the unutterable be conveyed unutterably,” or Hemingway’s iceberg theory. We knew all about what this world was, and why these apes are this way. And that somebody else might get a little tingle on their neck looking at it, thinking, “Yeah, this is kind of different. This isn’t just random.”  So you mentioned that you had some early “dumb ideas.” Can you say more?  Goner: The first idea we had was ... What was it? It was monsters, right? H.P. Lovecraft?  Gargamel: Well, we had that Lovecraftian kind of idea. We had an idea of [H.P.] Lovecraft monsters, to do to that type of Gothic horror.  Goner: Because they’re no longer in copyright anymore [they’re in the public domain], so it’s not a trademarked IP. So we said, “Oh, let’s build, like, H.P. Lovecraft monsters.” And then we started exploring. And then we just got really bored. Any idea that just doesn’t have a kernel truth to it, you just get bored with it.  Gargamel: That’s not who we are. We’ve never been [Lovecraft] fans. We were literally like, “Oh, we should do that. People would like that. And then…what the fuck are Lovecraft monsters anyway?”  Any other bad ideas?  Gargamel: At one point we said, “What does Crypto Twitter need?” And we’re like, “They need girlfriends. Okay, so let’s make them little digital girlfriends, it’ll be like CryptoCuties.” And then all of our wives and girlfriends were like –  CryptoKitties, but for women. What could possibly go wrong?! How could that possibly backfire?!  Gargamel: Yeah. All of our partners were like, “You guys suck.” We’re like, “Okay, yeah, we do suck.”  Getting back to the Apes, it seems like you guys are still pumping out new stuff all the time.  Goner: We just kept building. It’s funny. Before us, there were very few projects – not to say there were none – but there were very few projects where a founder stuck around and kept building utility. In fact, before us, very few people even talked about utility in NFTs. Everyone was just making a bunch of money selling NFT collections, and then f**king off to the south of France. We just sort of decided, what if we didn’t do that?  Goner: Like, hey, what if we stayed an extremely small team? Yes, we made $2.2 million overnight, and then we worked 14 hours a day every day. And people see that. They know. We are always in our Discord, we have hundreds of DMs, we respond to almost all of them.  What’s some of the utility – or bonus features – that you’re most proud of?  Gargamel: One of the most innovative things we did was dropping our Bored Ape Kennel Club. We were exhausted, and we were thinking, “What if we just gave every Ape a dog?” Everybody was aping into dogecoins. And crypto is so much about trust, so how do we signal that we want to stick around, we want to build utility here, and we want to think about the long term? What’s the best way to do that?  So we thought, “Hey, what if we gave every single person an NFT for free, and gave all the royalties [off sales from exchanges like OpenSea] to charity?” We ended up donating around $900,000 to different animal charities for that.  We bought Pelotons that we don’t use, that’s what we bought  Goner: Some of the charities even aped in because they became such fans.  Gargamel: Yeah, if you go to the Orangutan Outreach, we gave them like $800 grand or something ridiculous. And if you go on Twitter, their profile picture is a Bored Ape, and they have a bio for him on their website.  Amazing. How have your lives changed since all of this insanity started?  Goner: Well, we don’t sleep.  Gargamel: We don’t sleep anymore. Yeah, we haven’t stopped working. And we haven’t bought anything. [Thinks.] Oh, we bought Pelotons we don’t use.  Goner: We bought Pelotons.  Gargamel: We bought Pelotons that we don’t use, that’s what we bought. Yeah. [On our Zoom, he makes an expression that says, This is crazy.] Last year I made $60,000.  Goner: We’ve made a bunch of money, but we haven’t even had time to think about it. We just keep building. We just keep working. We’re still living the exact same lifestyle as before.  Any favorite moments stand out to you?  Goner: One of the funnier ones for me was with The New Yorker piece. Gargamel was like, “Did you ever think this would be our first time in The New Yorker?”  Gargamel: Like, for this?  Goner: For this?!  Gargamel: For our ape club?

It looked at how long the major tech stocks had taken to achieve their own $1 trillion valuation compared to BTC. This analysis is interesting because you can chart the impact of technology on the time it takes to reach a $1 trillion market cap. As the earliest pre-internet tech pioneers, Microsoft and Apple had to wait over four decades to hit $1 trillion. The advent of the internet cut the time in half for dot-com babies Amazon and Google, which hit their $1 trillion valuations in 24 and 21 years, respectively. With the introduction of blockchain, Bitcoin&apos;s $1 trillion market cap came after half as much time again - just twelve years. Reach is What Matters It&apos;s not the technology by itself that has created this accelerating pace of adoption. It&apos;s the fact that these two major developments - the internet and blockchain-enabled reach. The connectivity of the internet allowed tech firms to reach exponentially more users. The emergence of blockchain and its innovative economic model provided a new way for users to become engaged and participate in the value of a network. And now, projects are using the unique properties of blockchain to build and scale vast global networks. The creators of Nodle started out with the idea of a mesh network powered by smartphones.

Subscribe to Valid Points here.  Since joining CoinDesk three months ago, I’ve worked alongside Christine Kim and the CoinDesk Research team as an analyst covering Ethereum, decentralized finance and the crypto markets. While I’ve been interested in Ethereum for several years, I’d like to thank Christine and the CoinDesk team for providing me with a strong understanding of the technology and economics within the network.  Starting this week, I’ll be the new author of Valid Points.  I’m excited to continue my journey exploring the ins and outs of the Ethereum ecosystem, and I’ll continue to share my findings and research through this newsletter. The plan is to expand upon Validated Takes, collecting the most important news and data across all things Ethereum and to provide weekly updates on our very own CoinDesk Eth 2.0 Validator, affectionately known as “Zelda.”  Feel free to reach out with your thoughts and ideas for the newsletter by responding to this email or commenting on Twitter.  Welcome to another edition of Valid Points.  – Teddy  Pulse check  The following is an overview of network activity on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain over the past week. For more information about the metrics featured in this section, check out our 101 explainer on Eth 2.0 metrics.        Disclaimer: All profits made from CoinDesk’s Eth 2.0 staking venture will be donated to a charity of the company’s choosing once transfers are enabled on the network.  Validated takes  A consensus bug hit Ethereum on Friday, exploiting a vulnerability in outdated Go Ethereum (Geth) software and leading to a chain split. BACKGROUND: Go Ethereum developer Peter Szilágyi publicly announced the bug and issued a hotfix on Aug. 24. At the time of the exploit, only 30% of users had upgraded to the hotfixed software, allowing the attacker to target laggers. Geth software is used by nearly 75% of network users and plays a crucial role in the Ethereum ecosystem.  OpenSea, the largest NFT market, posted the largest month in history with over $2.8 billion in transaction volume. BACKGROUND: August’s non-fungible token trading volume was over seven times higher than the next largest month and included an explosion in corporate interest from the likes of Visa and Budweiser. Furthermore, OpenSea contracts are responsible for over two times more gas consumption than Uniswap v2 since the beginning of the month.  EIP 1559-style transactions now account for over 50% of the network, less than a month after the upgrade. BACKGROUND: A majority of wallets have now upgraded from legacy-style transactions, revealing the benefits of the month-old fee market. Positive effects include transaction failures falling from around 15% to 6.7% on top applications like Uniswap v3 and the exclusion of “zero gas” transactions, where miners were able to extract value and provide nothing to the network in return.  Competition in the layer 1 space has heated up over the past few weeks as investors speculate on native token prices. BACKGROUND: Sol, Avax, Atom and Luna have been top performers over the past month while they compete for network activity and Total Value Locked (TVL). The top 5 alternative layer 1s after Ethereum account for $34.82 billion in TVL, highlighting the demand for cheaper and faster transactions.  Offchain Labs raised $100 million in a Series B led by Lightspeed Ventures Partners and included Mark Cuban in the funding round. BACKGROUND: “Arbitrum One” has been one of the most widely awaited layer 2 scaling solutions, alongside Optimism. The rollup solution aims to go live for users on Aug, 31, hosting a suite of top decentralized applications at launch, including Aave, Curve, Sushi and Uniswap.

42410968,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggttNN,1630494058,Eastern Europe Received Over $1B of Illicit Crypto in a Year: Chainalysis,"A report published by Chainalysis on Wednesday details crypto-related criminal activity in Eastern Europe, which is broadly believed to be the home base for many infamous hacker groups and the drug marketplace Hydra, which Chainalysis has said is the world’s biggest.  “In terms of raw value, Eastern Europe has sent the second most cryptocurrency of any region to illicit addresses, behind only Western Europe,” the report reads.  In total, addresses associated with Eastern Europe received about $1.15 billion of illicit funds from July 2020 to June 2021, according to Chainalysis.  Hydra, in particular, is one of the reasons Eastern Europe sends more cryptocurrency to darknet markets than any other region in the world, the report said. The Russian-speaking darknet marketplace for drugs and illegal goods is believed to be a big driver of criminal crypto liquidity into Russia, earning up to 75% of the global darknet revenue, as Chainalysis said in an earlier report.  However, the biggest share of funds Eastern Europeans are sending to illicit addresses goes to scams, Chainalysis said.  “Between June 2020 and July 2021, Eastern Europe-based addresses sent $815 million to scams, second only to Western Europe,” the report reads. Most of the web traffic to known scam websites also comes from Eastern Europe, especially Ukraine, Chainalysis said.  The region also received “roughly $950 million worth of cryptocurrency from scam addresses,” which makes Eastern Europe the second-largest recipient of scam funds in the world, after Western Europe, Chainalysis said. This monthly number has been rising since March 2021, the firm added.  The most prolific case in the region turns out to be Finiko, an alleged Ponzi scheme whose founders are under criminal investigation in Russia. As CoinDesk reported, Russian police received reports from Finiko users, who claimed to have lost about $1 million in total. However, an anonymous source at Russia’s central bank told business publication The Bell the losses might have amounted to almost $95 million.  Chainalysis’ estimate is even more striking: The crypto sleuthing firm identified over $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin received by Finiko’s addresses in over 800,000 separate deposits, the report said.  “While it’s unclear how many individual victims were responsible for those deposits or how much of that $1.5 billion was paid out to investors to keep the Ponzi scheme going, it’s clear Finiko represents a massive fraud perpetrated against Eastern European cryptocurrency users, predominantly in Russia and Ukraine,” Chainalysis wrote.  Ransomware geography  Ransomware addresses believed to belong to Eastern European hackers received $46 million over the past year, “behind only Western Europe at $51 million.” Here, researcher’s task gets trickier because it’s hard to precisely locate any crypto address on the globe.  As Chainalysis said, the main assumption is the most notorious hacker groups are presumably associated with Russia, such as the Evil Corp, “whose leadership reportedly has ties to the Russian government,” the report said. Also, most ransomware strains affiliated with Russia and the neighboring countries have parts of code that prevents them from attacking the computers located in those countries.  “Our geographic attribution is based on web traffic to cryptocurrency services, so in cases where two regions use many of the same services, it’s more difficult to attribute transaction volume to the correct service,” Chainalysis wrote.  “Western Europe has high service overlap with more regions than any other, displaying particularly strong relationships with Eastern Europe, North America and Central and Southern Asia,” said Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ head of research.  “We believe that for some regions like North America, this dynamic reflects a convergence of institutional investors and professional traders on a handful of platforms. On the other hand, for regions like Eastern Europe and Central and Southern Asia, we believe the service overlap in those cases is also driven by remittance payments being sent from Western Europe, as this would mirror remittance activity we see in the fiat world,” Grauer added.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/eastern-europe-received-over-1b-of-illicit-crypto-in-a-year-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7dd2e2e8163f61dfcece7c1389abe55fa80fe138-2095x1431.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396949,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8Bxi,1630491704,Ether Tops $3.5K After Record Daily Coin Burn; Bitcoin’s Rangeplay Continues,"Ether climbed to a 3 1/2-month high a day after Ethereum set a new record for daily coin burn. Bitcoin continues to trade sideways as August’s top performer, SOL, takes a bull breather.  Ether, the native token of Ethereum’s blockchain and the second-largest coin by market value, is trading above $3,500 for the first time since May 18, CoinDesk 20 data show.  The cryptocurrency has gained 4.5% in the past 24 hours. The advance confirms a breakout from the recent two-week trading range of $3,000 to $3,400, setting the stage for an extension of the bullish move from July lows near $1,800.  “The latest move higher represents a bullish continuation of the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 1559-driven rally, which is probably enhanced via the ongoing non-fungible tokens (NFT) hype, which mainly happens on Ethereum,” said Simon Dedic, managing partner of Moonrock Capital, a London-based blockchain advisory and investment partnership firm. The EIP burns a portion of fees paid to miners.  Data tracked by crypto intelligence platform OKLink shows Ehereum burnt 12,000 ETH on Tuesday, a daily record for coins destroyed since the implementation of EIP 1559 on Aug. 5. Of the total coins destroyed, the NFT market OpenSea accounted for 2,000 ETH. The EIP 1559 has destroyed nearly 40% of the coin issued since activation.  Alex Svanevik, CEO of blockchain data company Nansen, also cited the NFT boom and the resulting decline in the net ether issuance as a bullish catalyst along with the continued rise in the amount of ether staked in the Beacon Chain, which introduced proof-of-staking to Ethereum’s blockchain last December. Glassnode data show there are now more than 7 million ether worth $24.8 billion held in the deposit contract for the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon chain. As discussed yesterday, analysts expect the combination of these factors to lead to a supply crisis in the ether market.  The market sentiment may have received a boost from Offchain Lab’s rollout of Arbitrum One, an Ethereum scaling solution that uses optimistic rollups technology to process transactions at a higher speed and lower cost than the Ethereum mainnet.  Indeed, Arbitrum facilitating relatively low-cost transactions could mean ether burn. However, along with other scaling solutions such as Polygon, the project will help ease Ethereum network congestion and bring long-term value to the smart contract blockchain. Arbitrum’s mainnet went live on Tuesday.  While ether is gaining altitude, bitcoin remains locked in the narrow range of $46,000 to $50,000. According to Delphi Digital, blockchain data shows continued accumulation by holders amid the range play.  Ethereum alternative Solana’s SOL token is trading near $110, having pulled back sharply from record highs near $130 reached Tuesday. Investors could be rotating money back to ether, having bought Solana and other so-called Ethereum killers in the second half of August.

42396936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT8Bor,1630490400,Crystal Offers Free Version of Its Blockchain-Sleuthing Software,"Cryptocurrency sleuthing firm Crystal Blockchain has introduced a free version of its transaction-tracing tool available to anyone curious about the provenance of their – or others’ – coins.  Crystal Block Explorer will be the first retail version of a professional blockchain analytics tool on the market. The tool is more limited in what it can do than Crystal Expert, the vendor’s flagship paid product.  While partly a marketing play for Crystal, the free product could be useful to ordinary users, researchers and journalists who can’t afford a subscription to software that can run into the tens of thousands of dollars annually.  In particular, users will be able to check if their crypto or a transaction of interest has ties to any known entity in the cryptocurrency market – for example, if the funds come from a certain exchange or are connected to a known fraudulent scheme. They will also see a risk score for their crypto, calculated by Crystal, indicating the chances the funds can get frozen on an exchange because of the coins’ transaction history.  “It’s not only financial institutions that want to better understand their activity related to digital assets – every cryptocurrency user wants to be able to understand more about the funds they are about to accept,” Marina Khaustova, CEO of Crystal Blockchain, told CoinDesk.  Crystal’s paid product is now used by “more than 1,900 customers, most of which are digital assets service providers, including Upbit, Coinspaid and Rain,” she said.  Mom-and-pop detectives  There is a budding industry of vendors providing anti-money laundering (AML) tools to exchanges and other crypto businesses. Such tools allow crypto firms to identify and freeze funds with suspected criminal origins, coming from hacks, exploits, scams or terrorism financing schemes.  Chainalysis, CipherTrace and Elliptic are some well-known companies in the market. In addition to serving private-sector clients, these vendors help government agencies navigate the frontier of cryptocurrency transactions.  There are also a handful of free tools like Walletexplorer and OXT that can help ordinary users draw connections between bitcoin addresses that may belong to the same entity – a challenging task when analyzing on-chain transactions. Those free tools, however, don’t always allow users to attribute a transaction to a particular known entity.  There are also paid retail products that allow users to quickly check if funds have been labeled as criminal in transaction-tracing systems (like those of Cipher Trace, Chainalysis, Crystal and Elliptic), which means that exchanges will likely freeze funds coming from such blacklisted addresses. That category includes Antinalysis and AMLbot – the latter, in turn, uses Crystal’s database.  In the case of Crystal’s new free tool, users will have limited access to the company’s proprietary data on who owns certain wallets, and they also will be able to generate charts that show the chains of connected transactions.  The free tool will let a user look up the owners of particular addresses a limited number of times per day, while the paid version doesn’t have that cap. Users of the free version also won’t be able to see attributions to high-risk entities, including darknet marketplaces, crypto mixers and scams.  The ability to check the legitimacy of counterparties is “crucially important to day-to-day use and adoption of digital assets in general,” Khaustova said.  “This equality of data readability is something we at Crystal believe should be a basic right for any digital asset user,” she said. “Transparency is a core crypto ecosystem value.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/09/01/crystal-offers-free-version-of-its-blockchain-sleuthing-software,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/788d1404b478213758c375377e89f3724842c3b9-1440x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411920,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glh5KA,1630488310,4 Tips to Maximize Your Crypto Investment,"Cryptocurrency investment has grown substantially over the last five years, with 14% of Americans now holding digital assets in their portfolios, up from a reported 1% in 2016. Some industry leaders have predicted this figure could double by the end of 2021, after 13% of survey participants expressed intentions to purchase crypto over the next few months.  For many new investors joining the market, learning how to get the most out of your crypto assets is essential for reducing risk and maximizing any potential returns. Here are four useful tips to get you started.  1. Diversification  One of the easiest ways to reduce risk and, in some cases, help improve returns is by investing across a range of different crypto assets. This is known in the trading world as diversification, or asset allocation. The idea behind this is to spread your investments to average out losses if the market takes a downturn.  For example, Bob and Alice both invest $1,000 in cryptocurrencies. Bob decides to invest $100 across 10 different cryptocurrencies, while Alice decides to go all in on a single asset. Alice is running the risk that if the market turns bearish, and if the project she invested in takes a heavy hit, she could suffer heavy losses. Bob, on the other hand, has spread his risk and stands a better chance of losing less overall (depending on whether he’s invested wisely or not). This can also work when the market rises.  A common strategy is to select different types of cryptocurrencies to ensure you benefit when one of the many sectors experiences a surge. Conversely, it also spreads risk in case there’s a dip in one or multiple sectors.  Here are just a handful of examples of different cryptocurrency types:  Store of value: bitcoin (BTC)  Non-fungible tokens, or NFTs: CryptoPunks  Smart contract technology: ether (ETH)  DeFi: uniswap (UNI)  Payment coins: litecoin (LTC)  Privacy coins: monero (XMR)  It is worth noting that although diversification aims to reduce risk or loss, it also has the potential to reduce your return on investment.  2. Copy trading  Copy trading, as the name suggests, is a type of investment trading where you automatically copy the trades of a professional investor. Platforms like eToro, Coinmatics and 3Commas are all examples of platforms that allow you to do this.  The setup is simple:  Select a trader to follow based on factors such as previous performance, number of followers and overall risk score (how risky are the invested assets).  Link your account to their movements.  When they choose to buy or sell a crypto asset, your portfolio automatically does the same.  This is a completely hands-free way to trade cryptocurrency without needing to study and track the market yourself.  Once you have settled on a trader (or traders), you can determine how much of your portfolio to allocate to each trader. Typically, this is in the form of a percentage of your balance. So if you have a balance of $1,000 to be invested, you could allocate 10% of your portfolio to copy trade one trader and 10% to another. This is another example of diversification and helps to spread out your funds and build a balanced portfolio. After you have finalized your investments, the trades will automatically start happening. Of course, you can always change traders or add more funds if they are doing well.  Just because they’re professional traders doesn’t mean they get it right every time. You cannot predict the success of a trader or the future movements of crypto assets so it is crucial to set up a loss limit. This is an automatic order that automatically stops your copy trading if you lose a predetermined amount or the value of an asset drops.  3. DeFi staking  This is where things start to get a bit more technical.  DeFi staking is a way of locking up your crypto assets in special, autonomous platforms known as “decentralized applications” in order to receive annual interest.  DeFi – or decentralized finance – is a sector of the cryptocurrency industry that takes traditional financial services like loans and insurance and puts them on the blockchain. The main difference being, the decentralized financial applications these services run on are not controlled or maintained by any single company. Instead, they are managed completely by their own communities of users and through automatically executing computer programs known as “smart contracts.”  Check out these articles if you’re unfamiliar with decentralized applications and smart contracts.  DeFi staking is a great way of generating an annual return on your deposited assets if you only plan on buying cryptocurrencies and holding them. The process is similar in nature to depositing money into a savings bank account except instead of earning less than 1% interest, you can typically earn anywhere between 5%-25% and in some cases, higher.  It is worth noting, however, that not all cryptocurrencies can be staked. A full list of supported staking assets can be found here. There are also some other risks to be aware of when dealing with DeFi platforms. These include:  DeFi platforms are not regulated. This means there are no consumer protections in place in the event you lose your capital from theft or fraud.  A number of DeFi platforms have not had their computer code audited by a third party to ensure there aren’t any bugs or exploitable flaws. This leaves the platforms vulnerable to hacks and exploits. So far in 2021, $361 million has already been stolen from DeFi applications.  It’s recommended anyone looking to lock away funds in a DeFi staking application should perform his or her own rigorous due diligence beforehand.  4. Learn to hedge crypto trades  What is hedging?  Hedging is a type of investment strategy aimed at reducing potential risk and losses incurred during adverse price movements in the market. It involves placing a primary trade in the direction you expect the market to go and then placing a second trade in the opposite direction. The idea here is, if the market goes against you the second backup trade you’ve placed will be in profit and offset the losses of your first trade.  A popular way crypto investors hedge their trades is by going long or short in the futures market. This is where two parties agree to trade a specific asset at a predetermined price and date.  Going long: Where you think the price of an asset will rise so you agree to purchase it at today’s price at a predetermined time in the future.  Going short: Where you think the price of an asset will fall so you agree to sell it at today’s price at a predetermined time in the future.  It’s important to know that trading futures is highly risky and should not be attempted by inexperienced traders. While it has unlimited upside potential (meaning there’s no cap on how much you can make), it also has unlimited downside potential. This means in some instances you can end up having to owe an exchange more than you initially invested. Stop-loss orders are advised to reduce risk when trading any asset. These automatically exit you out of a trade when the market price reaches a predetermined level.  Why would you hedge your crypto investments?  The crypto market is renowned for being highly volatile. This means the price of cryptocurrencies can change dramatically over a defined period of time. Bitcoin, for example, rose 125% between Jan. 1 to April 15, 2021, only to fall by 54% a few months later. Since the dip, prices are now up around 59%.  This unpredictability makes it incredibly difficult to know which direction the market will turn at any moment, meaning there’s a good chance the crypto assets you invest in won’t always go the way you want them to. Hedging provides peace of mind that whichever way the markets move, any losses suffered won’t be as severe.  The cryptocurrency space is constantly adapting and growing, providing ample opportunity to maximize your investments. These strategies are just a handful of ways to successfully stretch your funds and give you the greatest potential for a high return on investment based on the level of risk you are willing to tolerate. But it is also key to remember the golden rule for investing: If you are worried about the risk to your position, closing it or reducing its size is a safer option. And remember: Always invest and trade an amount you can afford to lose.     This content is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.

In a postmortem posted on Medium, the Cream Finance team said it is committing one-fifth of protocol fees until affected users have recovered all of their funds.  The protocol will post collateral with the AMP and Flexa teams until the debt is repaid. Affected users are invited to submit a request through a Google form.  Cream also revised its Monday estimate of the hack upwards. It said the hackers drained 462,079,976 AMP tokens and 2,804.96 ether, totaling upwards of $33.5 million.  This is the first time Cream was directly exploited, the post said, probably referring to another attack it suffered earlier this year.  The team has identified a main exploit and a copycat. The latter has withdrawal history on Binance, so Cream is working with the crypto exchange to identify the copycat. The two stole the funds over 17 transactions.  Cream is offering its usual bug bounty: If the hacker or hackers comes forward, they can keep 10% of the stolen funds.  The post confirmed earlier reports that the integration of ERC-777 AMP token contracts in the Cream protocol were the root cause.  While the AMP market integration took place in February, it was only five days before the attack that a big influx of AMP tokens on Cream made the account profitable, according to the blog post.  Cream said it will re-deploy AMP borrowing and lending once the vulnerability has been patched.

According to an internal audit report published last Thursday, the agency said its management of seized cryptocurrency assets and crypto-related investigative procedures needs to be improved.  The audit was led by Mary Lloyd, the agency’s cybersecurity and technology expert. It found a “lack of standardized [cryptocurrency] training” for postal inspectors and inconsistent communication between inspectors and the Cryptocurrency Fund Program, a body created in 2017 to serve as the custodian for the postal service’s crypto wallet and to generally oversee its crypto operations.  Additionally, accounting software used by USPIS to track transfers of cryptocurrencies during investigations was found to have “data integrity issues,” including duplicate transactions, that resulted in inaccurate records.  Postal inspectors investigate crimes involving the U.S. mail, often working with other law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), to catch criminals who use the mail system to transport drugs and other illegal substances.  Because cryptocurrency provides a layer of pseudonymity for illegal online transactions, often through dark web marketplaces, the USPIS and other law enforcement agencies have had to develop undercover crypto investigation procedures. Some of those methods have succeeded more than others.  Lloyd’s report said USPIS should develop a “comprehensive cryptocurrency training program” for its inspectors, “develop written procedures for the management and oversight of the national wallet,” fix the accounting system and improve communication between inspectors and the Cryptocurrency Fund Program.  The audit, which was announced in March, was self-directed. It was the first time the USPS has formally examined the topic of cryptocurrencies, according to a report from Nextgov, a publication that covers technology issues in the government.  The report also revealed the relatively small scope of the USPIS’ crypto investigations: In 2019 and 2020, the Cryptocurrency Fund Program received only nine requests for crypto for investigative purposes, and the postal inspectors seized crypto assets in only four cases.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/01/the-postal-services-law-enforcement-arm-is-buckling-down-on-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fca78afc16279ff294e309e22590513804736f14-5642x3174.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
