42401459,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9j8,1524315645,$10K Test? Bitcoin Price Hits 4-Week High As Altcoins Shine,"Bitcoin hit four-week highs in Asian hours but continues to underperform when compared to alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins).  Having scaled a long-term bearish trendline, the world's largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization rose to $9,021 at 07:30 UTC - the highest level since March 22, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  As of writing, bitcoin (BTC) is changing hands at $8,700 - up 34 percent from the April 1 lows below $6,450. The market capitalization hit a one-month high of $152 billion earlier today and was last seen at $148 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  But BTC's rally, though impressive, looks flat when compared to the performance of the top 25 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.    Data source: CoinMarketCap    Clearly, it has been the altcoin show so far. The lesser-known cryptocurrencies like populous are leading the cryptomarket rally.  EOS is now the fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, courtesy of the 106 percent price rise from April 1 low. Litecoin has dropped to number 6. Meanwhile, bitcoin ranks fourth from the last, despite having rallied 34 percent since April 1.  BTC's underperformance could be an indication the cryptocurrency is fueling the rise in the altcoins. Moreover, most altcoins are traded against BTC. So, investors pouring money into crypto markets tend to buy BTC first and then rotate the money into altcoins. The recent drop in the bitcoin dominance rate from 45.62 percent to 37.98 percent (today's low) also seems to suggest so.  History shows the altcoins surge happens after BTC reaches dizzy heights. For instance, BTC rally looked overdone in December and was followed by a rotation of money into cheap altcoins in late December and early January.  However, this time, the alternative cryptocurrencies have outshone bitcoin at a time when the crypto market leader is recovering from a three-month sell-off. This indicates growing confidence in the alternative currencies and also adds credence to the argument the crypto market has bottomed out.  Moving forward, the crypto markets could remain solidly bid as the world's largest cryptocurrency has witnessed a major bullish breakout.  Bitcoin daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  The long-term descending trendline has been breached in a convincing manner, signaling a long-term bullish-to-bearish trend change.  The 5-day moving average (MA) and the 10-day MA are trending north, indicating a short-term bullish setup.  The 200-day MA resistance is lined up at $9,737.  View  Despite the pullback from $9,060, the outlook remains bullish. Cryptocurrency may crowd out weak bulls (risk-averse traders) by revisiting the trendline support (former resistance) before finding acceptance above the $9,000 mark.  The bullish breakout suggests the cryptocurrency will likely test 200-day MA hurdle of $9,737 in the short-run.  Only a daily close (as per UTC) below the ascending (bullish biased) 10-day MA would signal bullish invalidation.

42401446,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9VM,1524305733,Why ICOs Could Eat Delaware's Lunch,"Andrea Tinianow, Esq. is chief innovation officer at Global Kompass Strategies and was, until January, head of the Delaware Blockchain Initiative. David Adlerstein is a corporate attorney at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz.  The views expressed in this article are solely those of the authors.      Over many decades, the State of Delaware has established a preeminent position as the jurisdiction of choice for businesses to organize, ranging from S&P 500 companies (a majority of which are incorporated in Delaware) to countless startups and LLCs.  This is not by accident; the state’s flexible corporate statutes, very well-developed business case law, highly sophisticated and experienced judiciary (including the renowned Court of Chancery), receptiveness to innovations such as the “poison pill,” and generally friendly commercial orientation offer efficiency and predictability to businesses and their equity holders and counterparties. From the standpoint of this small state with a population under 1 million, corporate franchise taxes are a vital source of revenue.  In recent years, other states have heightened their efforts to attract out-of-state businesses and to erode Delaware’s franchise, and while recently enacted tax reform should essentially halt so-called corporate inversion to lower tax jurisdictions outside the U.S., Delaware has lost untold millions in franchise taxes as a result of this practice.  Another transformative change is underway that could in the not-too-distant future negatively impact Delaware’s popularity as a jurisdiction of choice. This change is not related to lower taxes, but to the popularity of blockchain companies that raise capital through the issuance of tokens or coins, often referred to as initial coin offerings (ICOs), and, relatedly, to so-called “smart securities” or blockchain-based securities with smart contract functionality issued by non-blockchain companies.  Blockchain issuers raised an estimated $5 billion in 2017 through ICOs and, while these transactions varied widely in their quality (and compliance with securities laws), the popularity of ICOs has persisted into 2018 despite well-publicized scams, declining cryptocurrency prices, enforcement actions and strong cautionary pronouncements by the SEC and other regulators.  As evidenced by Telegram’s $850 million follow-on offering of purchase agreements for cryptocurrency earlier this month, the market appetite for tokens remains voracious, at least episodically. Given the continued development of public blockchain use cases and that tokens are the fuel of public blockchains, we expect interest in token offerings to persist.  Unlike shares of stock, tokens or coins generally do not confer ownership in any company and may not include security-like features at all. Token holders are not owed fiduciary duties by the board of directors (or anyone else). Rather, the tokens confer something akin to a license or a coupon, that gives the token holder the right to use the company’s blockchain platform and/or service, which may or may not exist at the time that the token is issued.  For example, the FileCoin ICO, one of the largest on record, confers a future right to digital storage.  New competition  Why should Delaware care about ICOs and tokens?  As the space matures and grows in legitimacy, we expect that more and more innovative companies (both start-ups and well-established) will choose to issue tokens or smart securities. For these companies, the appeal of Delaware’s brand of expertise that focuses on shareholder rights in traditional business frameworks could wane, particularly as other states, such as Wyoming and Nevada, actively vie to become the go-to states for blockchain companies and technology.  A new breed of blockchain entrepreneurs as well as traditional companies deploying blockchain technology to issue tokens can be expected to seek out other (token-friendly) jurisdictions that can provide clear regulatory guidance on the issuance of tokens and the rights of token holders.  As time goes by, these companies and their corporate boards are likely to be attracted to jurisdictions that have built up a body of case law that specializes in blockchain, tokens and related issues, in much the same way that Delaware developed jurisprudence in issues related to fiduciary duties and corporate governance, with the potential end result of Delaware being left behind in this rapidly growing sector.  This is not to say that the blockchain boom poses an existential threat to Delaware’s formidable corporate franchise. But Delaware’s primacy should not be taken for granted.  It is perhaps instructive that up until the early part of the twentieth century, New Jersey dominated corporate formations. But then-Governor Woodrow Wilson of New Jersey waged a campaign to curry favor with the populist faction in his bid for president. This campaign included anti-corporation rhetoric and the passage of antitrust legislation, leading to a mass exodus of New Jersey corporations. The exodus was a boon for Delaware, one which Delaware has nurtured over the last 100 years.  To the credit of its leadership, in August 2017, the State of Delaware was the first in the nation (and in the world) to enact legislation expressly authorizing corporations to maintain their corporate shares in a stock ledger on a blockchain. Since that time, several other states have introduced blockchain legislation relating to incorporations, tokens, transacting business, and much more.  In fact the State of Wyoming recently passed several pieces of legislation that not only copied Delaware’s blockchain amendments but went a step further by providing guidance on how blockchain companies that issue tokens can do business in the State compliantly.  Next steps  The State of Delaware is currently making thoughtful efforts to facilitate the use of blockchain technology so companies can file UCC financing statements and issue shares directly on a blockchain.  These are important initial steps, and certainly the State should proceed with care. But in order to maintain a leadership position in the blockchain space, more will be needed in the not-too-distant future.  In particular, Delaware could benefit by, and should seriously consider, providing additional guidance around the issuance of tokens and cryptocurrency (including by being receptive to new legislation, if appropriate), and by leveraging the state’s refined body of business law and expert judiciary to attract responsible blockchain projects; indeed, the industry would stand to benefit from Delaware’s unique brand of expertise regarding governance.  If we have seen anything in the blockchain space it is that blockchain companies will need a strong governance regime if they are to succeed both individually and as a sector.  Delaware can help with that.

42401449,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcp9ZI,1524302446,"Rappers, Ravens and Lord of the Rings: The Race for 'Dope' Coin Names Is On","In the Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""mithril"" is a rare, indestructible metal whose beauty never tarnishes; in the real world, however, it's the name of three different blockchain projects, all of which are trying to score pop culture points with investors.  It's of little surprise that the name has proven so hot in the crypto world – ""Lord of the Rings"" is, after all, the geek culture equivalent to Shakespeare, and there's no lack of geeks in the cryptocurrency community.  Indeed, cryptocurrency projects of all kinds are branding themselves or their coins with notable sci-fi or fantasy references.  For instance, there's Tron, a top 20 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, which seems clearly riffing off the classic 1980s film by the same name (which got a successful reboot in 2010).  And a newer project that's caught some buzz recently is harkening back to popular HBO series Game of Thrones (adapted from George R. R. Martin's books) calling itself Ravencoin. (Ravens have long been used as a symbol of prophecy and the Ravencoin project's website specifically calls out the Game of Thrones reference to the bird as messengers of truth, which parallel the concept of blockchains as a technology for ultimate truth.)  And lastly, a crypto entrepreneur and veteran of the trade in URLs or domain names, Joshua Metnick, pointed to Neo as a power name. Sometimes called the ""etheruem of China,"" the Neo team rebranded from Antshares in June, taking on the name of the protagonist in the super popular Matrix trilogy.  Looking at their CoinMarketCap chart, it would be hard to argue the switch didn't have an impact on the coin's price. The protocol's token shot up in value right afterward, from $1, and has remained around $65.  Indeed, the interest is using monikers that are well-known throughout nerd culture raises an important question: just how important are these names to the evolution of a crypto token?  In conversation with CoinDesk, Metnick said:  ""There is a certain 'coolness' or 'dope-ness' level to coins that is important and should be thought through before launching a coin.""  The many mithrils  In the case of mithril, several crypto entrepreneurs are all hoping that name pays off.  The first, Jeffrey Huang, also known as the father of Taiwanese hip-hop, is a blockchain-based competitor to services like Instagram and Snapchat, aiming to reward content creators for their posts and in turn, make the app popular through what it calls ""social mining.""  After the project raised 26,000 ether in a private sale of 5,000 ""mithril"" tokens, the company launched an app, called Lit – available for Android and iOS – which together already have 10,000 daily active users.  Speaking to his choice of the token name, Huang told CoinDesk he is a big fantasy and sci-fi fan, and although he originally considered ""uru,"" the stone used to make Thor's hammer, uru didn't sound as cool as mithril.  Meanwhile, another project Mithril Ore is built around the idea of ethereum's forthcoming proof-of-stake system, Casper. The company will sell mithril ore tokens to buy ethereum that can be used to create a large stake, which the company believes will allow smaller investors to get involved in mining without needing to have mined for some time.  Explaining why it choose the name, Laura Hopkins, the company's CEO told CoinDesk, ""Mithril is a rare, solid and near indestructible resource. It is precious and scarce. We have 500,000 tokens that will ever be minted and we only go to 2 decimals. Hence, we are strong, valuable, and rare - like mithril. Hence, 'Mithril Ore.'""  As it happens, many rappers have also rhymed the praises of this second mithril, as well.  And the final project (which changed up the spelling a bit to hearken back to a material used to create armor and weapons in the fictional universe of the Final Fantasy video games) Mythrilhttps://consensys.net/diligence/mythril.html, isn't a token project, but instead, a security analysis tool maintained by etheruem startup Consensys.  When asked about the name, Bernhard Mueller, the software's creator, said, ""I have been waiting for someone ask this.""  He continued:  ""One can imagine the ethereum blockchain as a physical chain that has been reinforced with ether and is therefore indestructible by normal means. However, those who wield a weapon forged of Mythril have the power to undo the magical barrier and lay waste to the blockchain.""  As such, Mueller, who created it in an effort to eliminate the major vulnerabilities in ethereum smart contract code that have led to the loss of millions of dollars in ether, built Mythril to find the faults in smart contracts so that malicious actors won't be able to later.  What's in a name?  That said, one company already gave up on the name – pointing to the need to differentiate itself and eliminate confusion – rebranding from Mithril Coin to Plactal.  And the overlapping names could later explode into a mess of trademark wars and litigation, some of which we've already seen in the crypto space.  Looking back at the early days of the web, for instance, shows how important securing names can be.  For example, two entrepreneurs acquired the domain ""MP3.com"" in 1997 and started posting new music there. At the time, people were searching ferociously for places to get mp3s, and while the entrepreneurs weren't the ones who invented the mp3, they were smart enough to see possibilities in that piece of digital real estate.  The next year, they sold a 10 percent stake in the company for $45 million, according to Wikipedia, and in 1999, it went public raising $370 million – a record IPO at the time.  Then, in the pre-mobile days, a name could also be a strict claim to the territory. For instance, any name attached to a "".com"" dominated any other URL.  Still, Metnick explained, there are ways to enforce trademarks. Using the U.S. as an example, he said that knowingly violating someone's trademark incurs exceptionally harsh damages.  On the other hand, a company has to enforce its trademark. If a trademark holder waits too long to enforce the use of a name for a product that conflicts with the own, the courts can decide to let them coexist, Metnick explained.  For a cryptocurrency or crypto token, a name would be considered a ""trademark"" under the law of most western countries provided it's actually in circulation, because trademarks are established by use (not registration).  ""I would be surprised if a lot of these coins were active and aware and enforcing these brands,"" Metnick said, adding:  ""There are only a finite supply of cool words like 'mithril.' It's a decent supply, but it's not infinite.""
