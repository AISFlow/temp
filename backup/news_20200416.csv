42404499,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiULH,1587069693,Market Wrap: Ether Making Big Gains as Stablecoins Proliferate on Ethereum,"There has been an increase in the number of stablecoins issued over the past month, mainly on the Ethereum network. That popularity may also be lifting ether on Thursday.      Ether (ETH) prices have climbed 8.4 percent over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk price data as of 20:10 UTC (4:10 PM EDT )on Thursday.      Total supply of the top five fiat-backed stablecoins has increased by over 25 percent, primarily led by U.S. dollar-pegged tether (USDT) on the Ethereum network, with over $1.5 billion in issuance since March 12.      The March 12 date is significant because that ""Black Thursday"" was a volatile day for cryptocurrency markets. Massive selling and derivatives liquidations totaling over $700 million on BitMEX sent prices downward, with ether going below $100 for the first time since 2018.      But this month the cryptocurrency market has been witnessing lower levels of spot trading volume and a dip in volatility after a see-saw March. So why are there more stablecoin assets being issued in this low volume, low-volatility environment?      See also: Open Interest in CME Bitcoin Futures Rises 70% as Institutions Return to Market      “I think offshore and non-U.S. participation in getting access to [the U.S. dollar] through stablecoins is the culprit,” said Neil Van Huis, director of sales and institutional trading at digital asset financial services firm Blockfills. Van Huis also referenced the rise of other stablecoins, which compete with tether available on USD exchanges, also fueling growth. USDC, for example, is a joint venture between U.S. crypto companies Circle and Coinbase.      “Stablecoins, outside of tether, have become much more accessible globally,” Van Huis added.      As the world’s largest stablecoin, tether is mostly traded on exchanges that don’t have USD available. “Possible reasons for demand for stablecoin issuance might include users wishing to buy other digital assets and using stablecoins as a low-friction on-ramp as we believe they always have. In any event, we are gratified by the recent market demand for USDT,” said Stuart Hoegner, general counsel at Bitfinex, which controls the tether stablecoin.      So, what’s with the price rise of ether? Daniel Kim, head of business development for exchange aggregator SFOX, says the promise of decentralized finance (DeFi) is tending towards increased investment in ether. DeFi’s promise requires stablecoins to proliferate on the Ethereum network, and issuance increases are a bullish sign. “With market uncertainty, investors are looking for a safe yield investment, which stablecoins are providing.” Kim said.      See also: Ethereum Now Matches Bitcoin on One Key Metric      Even so, not everyone can agree on the prospects of Ethereum as a network translating into long-term ether gains, despite today’s price appreciation. “There's a marginal contribution, but nothing that is defensible from the perspective of making ether a proxy for profiting from increased stablecoin issuance,” said Vishal Shah, a crypto options trader and founder of derivatives exchange Alpha5.      However, in the short term, SFOX’s Kim also noted both the wire transfer issues Finastra had when crypto markets crashed in March and coronavirus uncertainty as signals for some to invest in DeFi networks like Ethereum’s ether.      “With the most recent issue with Finastra and with what's going on with COVID-19, investors are less confident of our banking system in moving funds when needed,” Kim noted. Indeed, value transfer on the Ethereum network is now surpassing that of Bitcoin, the world’s oldest cryptocurrency network.    Today’s price action    Prices for bitcoin (BTC) gained 3.6 percent in 24 hour trading Thursday according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index as of 20:10 UTC (4:10 PM EDT in New York).      Trading for bitcoin has jumped above the 10- and 50-day moving average on spot exchanges including Coinbase. It’s a purely bullish signal after bitcoin broke into the $7,000 level around 9:00 UTC (5 a.m. EDT), triggering $23 million in liquidations on BitMEX with 93 percent consisting of short positions.      For the past 10 hours since the jump into $7,000 territory, bitcoin has been trading sideways in a $6,900-$7,000 range.    Other markets    Most digital assets are up on CoinDesk’s big board for the day. Big gainers include zcash (ZEC) in the green 7.9 percent, eos (EOS) up 7.9 percent and decred(DCR) gaining 5.4 percent 20:10 UTC (4:10 PM EDT).      Elsewhere, gold is climbing by less than 1 percent as of 20:10 UTC (4:10 p.m. EDT) after a few days of sideways trading in the $1,700 range.      In Asia, the Tokyo-based Nikkei 225 index closed Thursday down 1.3 percent as the transportation and real estate sectors were hit with losses.      Europe’s FTSE 100 index ended trading in the red less than a percent as one analyst noted subdued trading in London on the day.      Trading of the S&P 500 index of large U.S. stocks was mixed, gaining less than a percent, as a fresh jobless report of another 5 million pushed unemployment to 15 percent this week. U.S. Treasury bonds continue to deal with selling pressure Thursday, with 2-year, 10-year and 30-year yield all down. The 30-year is experiencing the worst drop, falling 5 percent as of 20:10 UTC (4:10 PM EDT in New York).",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | USDT,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/16/market-wrap-ether-making-big-gains-as-stablecoins-proliferate-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/466a757daab1ade73f47a0de6024017931c73892-1102x734.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42404492,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdiUEO,1587069058,Decentralized Protocol Removed From EU Contact Tracing Website Without Notice,"The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT)https://www.pepp-pt.org/ consortium, which is charged with helping develop the protocols for a privacy-focused European Union contact tracing system, has removed any mention of the decentralized protocol proposal Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP3T) from its website.    Contact tracing is the process by which health authorities track the spread of viruses, identifying who has been in contact with infected individuals and should therefore be quarantined. Countries are pursuing a variety of digital methods of doing so, ranging from location tracking of cell phones and facial recognition, to digital health passes that restrict movement and Bluetooth proximity tracing. Last weekend, Google and Apple announced a plan to update their mobile operating systems to allow Bluetooth tracing.      Any E.U. contact tracing would have to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which ensures greater privacy and data protection for EU citizens than is currently enforced in the U.S.      See also: Europe Debates COVID-19 Contact Tracing That Respects Privacy      The DP3T team, which outlined its proposal to CoinDesk earlier this week, was not told the protocol was being removed from the site, and was not invited to attend a PEPP-PT call Friday with the consortium's various partners, according to three sources familiar with the matter.      “We found this in the morning, so far with no comment from them,” said someone close to the DP3T negotiations. ""There are also other changes that smell centralized, and we don't know what the German government means when they say they plan on implementing ‘PEPP-PT architecture’ as now there is nothing. This seems very worrisome, and that they may implement something that has not been publicly reviewed.”      It’s now unclear what a PEPP-PT protocol might look like, as the consortium website, while listing general guidelines, does not offer concrete proposals, only general principles.    A centralized approach has more privacy risks, as well as the potential for the re-appropriation of data for other purposes, like state surveillance.    CoinDesk reached out to the PEPP-PT contact listed on the initial press release, who did not return a request for comment by the time of publication.      The difference between decentralized and centralized systems are not benign in this context. As CoinDesk has written about previously, a centralized approach has more privacy risks, as well as the potential for the re-appropriation of data for other purposes, like state surveillance, the researchers say. Because of this, designers of the DP3T protocol say their design would encourage more trust in the apps built on the protocol, making them more likely to be downloaded and therefore more effective.      In Germany, the government has said it will be rolling out an app in a matter of weeks, according to the Financial Times, but exactly what app that will be is unclear. The backers of Healthy Together, one of the German app options, have focused on the app’s data protection measures, based on the PEPP-PT framework. It does not involve geolocation data, but Bluetooth proximity tracking, that would be processed locally on users’ phones. But Linus Neumann of the Chaos Computer Club, the largest hacker network in Europe, told the Financial Times that the app’s anonymity could be compromised with minimal changes.      See also: For Contact Tracing to Work, Americans Will Have to Trust Google and Apple      Kenneth Paterson, who is a professor at the Applied Cryptography Group at the ETH Zurich Computer Science Department and is working on the DP3T proposal, said he can’t be sure what PEPP-PT is building now.      “Their system is closed and not open to review by external experts. We can’t look at a specification,” said Paterson. “We can’t look at code. So the system could be full of bugs. It could have a backdoor for the security services. No one outside their closed project can tell.”      “This opens the gates to privacy hell: It could give governments the ability to build the ‘social graph’ for everyone who downloads the app, i.e., they could trivially figure out who is in close proximity to whom.

Alan Friedland and his company “Fintech Investment Group, Inc.” allegedly marketed Compcoin as the key to a proprietary foreign exchange trading software, ART. This algorithm was said to predict dollar-to-euro forex trades with pinpoint accuracy and yield high returns, the complaint said. Cryptocurrency gave investors access and hundreds of investors jumped in.      “In eight years of controlled lab testing, Compcoin delivered an average 10% quarterly return on investment (ROI) – much higher than the ROI of most retail and institutional forex traders,” promised the white paper.      The scheme successfully brought in $1.6 million, the CFTC claimed, and even managed to get Compcoin listed – temporarily – on digital asset exchanges during its sale from 2016 through 2018. Success was short lived.      As alleged by the CFTC, none of the investors got what they paid for. According to the complaint, the man and the company that they paid were not approved to market access to a forex algorithm at all. The National Futures Association (NFA) never approved Fintech's Compcoin disclosure statements, according to the complaint.      Additionally, on April 2 the NFA issued a complaint against Friedland and his company for ""failure to cooperate"" in NFA's investigation of Compcoin.      “Instead of gaining access to ART’s high success rate at predicting USD/EUR forex trades and high rate of return from the trades as promised, purchasers of Compcoin were left with a valueless asset,” the CFTC complaint alleges.      “The CFTC remains committed to protecting market participants from fraudulent schemes, including novel forms of fraud like the one alleged here, where defendants allegedly solicited customers to purchase a digital asset in order to gain access to Fintech’s purported forex trading algorithm,” CFTC Director of Enforcement James McDonald said in a press release.

42431744,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62fh,1587066358,Digital Dollar Project: Don't Rush Digital Dollar During COVID-19 Crisis,"J. Christopher Giancarlo is senior counsel at Willkie, Farr & Gallagher and former chairman of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.      As you read this, the United States along with the rest of the world has been struck with the COVID-19 pandemic. As Washington has implemented the policy response of social distancing with the resulting braking of the economy, it has set upon issuance of direct payments to individuals to offset lost wage income. To better effectuate direct assistance, proposals have been made for so-called “digital dollar” electronic cash payment infrastructures to distribute electronic payments directly to consumers. These proposals to date consider “digital dollars” in terms of distribution functionality for government benefits, not as a form of true central bank digital currency (CBDC).      The Digital Dollar Project proposes something far more fundamental: a new, additional format for U.S. currency, a digital dollar that has the same legal status as the dollars in one’s purse, only on a personal device. For government agencies charged to distribute government crisis benefits to vulnerable populations, especially those without access to banking services, direct transmission of digital dollars to smartphones would be a time-saver. Moreover, in a pandemic where viruses are transmitted by paper money and metal cash transactions, paying for food and essentials with digital dollars is more than convenient, it could be a lifesaver.      See also: ‘Digital Dollar’ Reintroduced by US Lawmakers in Latest Stimulus Bill      The Digital Dollar Project was launched earlier this year to lead public discussion of the merits of a tokenized form of a United States CBDC or, what we alliteratively call the “Digital Dollar.” The project looks to encourage research and public dialogue on the potential advantages of a digital dollar, convene private sector thought leaders and actors, and propose possible models to support the public sector.      The Digital Dollar Project is a partnership between Accenture, the global consultancy firm, and the Digital Dollar Foundation. The Foundation is a not-for-profit organization formed with my brother Charles Giancarlo, a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur, investor and executive, and Daniel Gorfine, former CFTC chief innovation officer. The Accenture team is led by David Treat, managing director and global head of Accenture’s Capital Markets Blockchain practice.      Determined to bring many perspectives and professional disciplines to bear, the Digital Dollar Project recently announced a diverse advisory board that includes economists, business leaders, technologists, innovators, lawyers, academics, consumer advocacy and human rights experts and ethicists from across the political spectrum. The board has held two virtual meetings, with more scheduled. And the project has given a series of briefings to congressional staff, Administration officials and policy bodies in the U.S. and abroad. We’ll soon publish a white paper setting out the benefits of a tokenized U.S. CBDC for the American economy and the broader global financial community.    Something as complex and worthy of the U.S. dollar’s global importance should not be cobbled together in a crisis. Getting it right will take time. Nevertheless, now is the right time to get started.    It is a somewhat unique historic characteristic of the U.S. that when it embarks upon critical technological initiatives, such as landing a man on the moon or building the internet, it often does so through a series of partnerships between the private and public sectors. We believe that creating a well-architected, durable and universal digital dollar is of similar importance. But building it will be an enormous undertaking. It needs to be done carefully, thoughtfully and deliberately and in a way that supports the critical monetary and public policy imperatives of the public sector with the knowhow, ingenuity and project management skills of the private sector. Our project aims to be a private sector thought leader in this endeavor.    Defining a digital dollar    In the two-tiered banking system within the United States, the Federal Reserve (Fed) issues bank notes for the general public and reserves for the banking system. Our proposed digital dollar would maintain the same two-tiered distribution architecture: commercial banks would trade reserves for digital dollars to issue and distribute for end user transactions.      The digital dollar would be a liability of the Fed carrying the full faith and credit of the U.S. This is different from proposals from various banks, like JPMorgan, for bank tokens that are liabilities of their singular institutions. Nevertheless, we don’t view a digital dollar as competitive with or antithetical to the development of private stable coin efforts, many of which seek to tokenize commercial bank money. Private sector innovation should continue to be built atop public monetary infrastructure.      See also: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to Congress      Our proposed digital dollar would be tokenized. “Tokenization” is the act of turning an asset, good, right or currency into a digital representation with properties sufficient to attest and transfer ownership. In today’s current world, cash is a physical token. To verify the transaction, you only need to confirm the authenticity of the bill. Because each bill is unique, it is impossible to spend the same bill more than once. This differs from account-based electronic money, which uses a reconciliation-intensive, message-based approach to adjust entries in a ledger.      In a token-based system, the token (just like the dollar bill) contains all information necessary for the recipient to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. In an account-based system, the operator of the system authenticates the sender to ensure authorization to update account balances. Physical cash, banknotes, are examples of token-based central bank money, and central bank reserve accounts and bank deposit accounts are examples of central bank account-based money.      In a token model, distributed ledger technology (DLT) based systems ensure uniqueness and prevent duplicate spends through a consensus model that provides secure transaction ordering. The consensus model, which provides a mechanism to design and control specific transaction features, can fall along a spectrum of centralization and decentralization, depending on public policy concerns and the desired features of the system.     New format of money    The digital dollar is a much larger undertaking than just a federal government payments infrastructure. It means a tokenized, digital form of U.S. legal tender with all the future advantages and challenges it will engender. Its creation will likely be a source of fundamental innovations for the broader financial system. Combined with DLT, a tokenized digital dollar would be a new financial medium and new payment rail upon which central bank money can be sent and received.      It would serve as an innovative financial market infrastructure that would be portable, sent as easily as a text and allow settlement irrespective of space and time and bank access. And it would enhance confidence for conducting digital payment transactions, broaden scope, diversification and resilience in dollar payments and support retail, wholesale and international payment use cases.      Retail eCommerce is challenging for populations traditionally underserved in retail banking. A digital dollar would offer a new choice for digital transactions, instantaneous peer-to-peer payments, potentially lower costs and diversification of payment rails. It would grant economic actors greater autonomy, especially in times of heightened financial distress.       See also: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar      As with any cash exchange, a retail digital dollar transaction would be complete as soon as possession changes. That is very different from other cashless payments, whether by credit card, wire, personal check or digital app such as Zelle or Venmo, in which settlement is not complete until their banks have recorded, reconciled, and settled their respective debits and credits.       Wholesale payments rest on national payment systems. They are normally conducted through interbank clearing using central bank money to settle securities and other large value payments. The role that central bank money plays in conducting large value payment transactions has important distributive effects. Current wholesale large value transactions are account-based and predominantly executed by banking and payment providers that have accounts with the Federal Reserve. Only organizations with Fed accounts can transact in central bank money. A tokenized digital dollar would provide alternative access to central bank money and support the emergence of broader, more diverse financial market infrastructures.       International payments currently cannot be conducted digitally in U.S. central bank money. A digital dollar would allow more direct monetary relations to be established, reduce risks, address persistent deficiencies of the existing correspondent banking model, enhance competition in international payments and advance financial market integration. The use of a digital dollar in cross-border and offshore transactions would enable digital payments in central bank money for remittances and large value payments, including the possibility to conduct offshore securities settlement.       See also: Ex-CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo on Why He Launched Digital Dollar Project      The Digital Dollar Project will continue its exploration of a true U.S. CBDC in thoughtful writings and by proposing a series of iterative pilot programs. Creating a well-functioning and universal digital dollar should be done in the same way that the internet was created, by supporting the monetary and public policy concerns of the public sector with the know-how, financing and project management skills of the private sector. And it should be done deliberately, cautiously and, yet, with determination.       Something as complex and worthy of the U.S. dollar’s global importance should not be cobbled together in a crisis.

BitGo announced Thursday that Lumina would become part of its new institutional-grade tax solution that would plug into the wider platform. Known as ""BitGo Tax,"" it records and analyzes taxable events, calculates possible liabilities and compiles reports for clients.      In a statement, CEO Mike Belshe said the acquisition means that in addition to tapping secure storage services, BitGo clients can trade, stake and even lend digital assets, all without leaving the platform.      “Clients have digital asset accounts across many exchanges and wallet providers, and that can lead to a fragmented or incomplete view of their digital asset holdings,"" he said. ""BitGo clients now have a clear, intuitive dashboard with tax and reporting abilities, and these new services transform their ability to interact with digital assets.""      See also: Crypto Holders Still Face Issues Reporting Tax Liabilities, Survey of CPAs Finds      BitGo – which doesn't like to be referred to as just a custodian anymore – started targeting the institutional space when it coaxed former banker Richard J. Corcoran out of retirement to head up its custodial business at the end of 2018. It has endeavored to make itself as amenable as possible to institutions by launching a secure off-chain settlement service and partnering with Genesis to offer trades that execute at speeds customary in traditional markets.      This aggressive expansion has borne fruit as BitGo now has a central role in the cryptocurrency market. Belshe claimed back in November that the company processes, on average, as much as 20 percent of bitcoin transactions at any one time.      Back in February it acquired Harbor, a security token platform that held ambitions of becoming a one-stop-shop for tokenized equities. Notably, Harbor was already a regulated broker-dealer and transfer agent, two licenses BitGo lacked.      ""BitGo is the first digital asset firm to launch comprehensive services for wallets/custody, institutional lending, portfolio management and tax.

The Libra Association said its libra would not be a single currency that was backed by a basket of national currency but would now be a model of numerous individual fiat-pegged currencies. While the original model was akin to a disruptive implementation of John Maynard Keynes' original concept for a global basket currency (which he called a “bancor”), this model seems more to position libra to help existing central banks digitize their currencies.      China, meanwhile, steamed forward with its digital currency and blockchain plans.

42431745,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62jh,1587062760,Why Tech-Minded Climate Groups See COVID-19 as a Trial Run for Massive Change,"Thanks to our current state of lockdown, global carbon emissions are down somewhere between 20 and 40 percent, according to various estimates. But that’s merely a fraction of the reductions sought by governments around the world as part of the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change.      To put things in perspective, many of the most-polluting countries must reduce their emissions by 90 percent.      It’s well-known that the digitization of everything is key to reaching these gargantuan 2050 goals. But how will a new (and rather hyped) type of database make this happen?      It will involve the decentralization of decision-making at all levels, says Tom Baumann, co-chair of the Climate Action group at the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), which recently launched a COVID Task Force in conjunction with the European Commission and University College London.      Climate change, while not as immediately pressing as the COVID-19 pandemic, also requires a radical change in our lifestyles.      Read more: Can Bitcoin Survive the Climate Change Revolution?      “Already we sense the feeling of how our lives are changing – not in a way we would like right now. And don’t forget, these [Paris Agreement] goals are, frankly, a starting point. So that's going to require a lot of social and cultural buy-in,” said Baumann, who also co-chairs the Hyperledger climate working group.      Changing the way decisions are made within society is what Baumann refers to as one of the “non-technical aspects” of blockchain. These radical changes will come about by “allowing individuals to vote with their wallets using programmable money,” and providing “trusted and transparent frameworks for accounting climate actions,” he said.    Automatic for the people    Looking ahead, cryptocurrencies and digital tokens are evolving in ways that can incorporate automated internal governance of common resources and encourage collaboration among communities.      To frame this as a question relating to climate action: “How can financial and non-financial value be incorporated into digital currencies that promote, not simply the sustainable production, but the sustainable consumption patterns that are consistent with the decarbonized or net-zero lifestyle?” asks Baumann. “It’s about being able to empower individuals to be more effective decision-makers.”      Blockchains can keep track of scarce digital units of value, which can be aligned in micro-economic systems to achieve common goals and favorable outcomes for communities. For example, a government scheme could reward users of solar energy with digital tokens that can then be used to pay fares on greener forms of public transport.      Read more: When Money Becomes Programmable – Part 1      But decentralizing a massive piece of critical infrastructure like the national electricity grid of a developed country is a bewildering prospect.      Irene Adamski, co-chair of INATBA’s Energy Working Group, said blockchain projects sprouting up all over the place are creating innovation by increments, and this is better suited to addressing the problem than a single, heavily funded attempt at an overhaul.      “We are now seeing different ways of socializing the cost of energy in a decentralized manner by way of incremental changes here and an experiment or a sandbox over there,” said Adamski, a blockchain adviser to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).      “The levers are very sensitive so there is not a lot of room for error. But using the precision of computing technology to handle that in a decentralized and automated manner, possibly involving artificial intelligence, will give a lot more room for maneuverability,” she said.      Such ambitious and transformative tasks will get a shot in the arm thanks to coronavirus, Adamski said. “In Germany we are seeing a lot of bureaucratic barriers tumbling down as people jump and say they need solutions now,” she added.    Small is beautiful    From a climate change perspective, global supply chains have become too vast and complex for our own good.      These could be curtailed by changing consumer behavior on the ground, and the easiest lever to pull is pricing, said Adamski.      “A precise and robust system for pricing and tracking carbon emissions, built using blockchain technology, will change patterns of consumption,” she said. “Exotic fruit or meat flown half way across the world would become much more expensive. The same goes for very drastic distortions of the market where a train ticket across Europe can be much more expensive than a flight.”      Read more: Plastics Recycling Looks Promising to Enterprise Blockchain Startups      This involves a recalibration of capitalism’s underlying metrics of ever-increasing growth and consumption. It’s an old idea, fast growing in popularity again, that “small is beautiful,” to quote the philosopher and economist E.F. Schumacher (sometimes called the grandfather of the green movement).      Over the course of the last century, humans have been busy liquidating Earth’s natural capital in order to sustain levels of consumption that are far beyond planetary bounds, said Baumann. There is now need for “de-growth,” a 180-degree turn from capitalism.      “I’m not suggesting that there be no airplanes in the sky or economic activity,” he said. “Of course there's going to be a move to zero-emissions energy-powered transport and buildings. But also our levels of activity – like taking ten trips a year – that's not reasonable. There will be material and other trade-offs.”      A looming coronavirus catastrophe in the developing world will expose how completely unsustainable the global economic system has become, said Andrew Heath, external engagement manager at Practical Action, a charity formed by Schumacher in the late 1960s.      Read more: Yale Researchers Turn to Hyperledger to Track Carbon Emissions      While a lockdown in the developed world has seen supply chains creaking, what happens to people who need to earn money every day to buy food, or small farmers who need to get hold of seeds to continue to sow and harvest, said Heath.      “There are stories of farmers having to throw away milk because they can’t get to market, or cull chicks because they can't get hold of feed. In the Global South, there’s every chance of supply chains falling down completely. We would argue for more focus on local supply chains and the need for these to be stronger than ever,” he said.    World War Zero    In addition to the decentralization and realignment of our global economic systems, blockchain can also keep a check on our progress by accounting for the planet’s shared carbon budget.      In this case, blockchain would ensure there is scientific integrity behind any natural capital accounting, said Baumann. “People are concerned about the truthfulness or credibility of sustainability claims. If blockchain can provide irrefutable transparent accountability then that will encourage people to have greater faith and willingness,” he said.      Baumann suggests tokenizing the carbon budget as a mass balance that the scientists say we should respect: If there are 400 billion tons that are available and 8 billion people, that's 50 tons per person.      Read more: Hyperledger Conference Shows Where Blockchain Can Fight Global Warming      The question then becomes how to allocate that capital to each person, taking into consideration the fact that a very small percentage of the world’s population created the climate change problem to date.      “It’s a really deep cultural mindshift. I often equate it to something like a religious conversion level of commitment if we are really going to achieve those goals,” said Baumann. “But living small is beautiful, to go back to some of the 1960s and ‘70s environmental messages.”      Adamski’s favorite term for the climate action debate is “World War Zero,” whereby a similar effort to that seen during WWII is required to successfully preserve a livable planet.      “Coronavirus is showing us right now that we are capable of a lot,” she said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/16/why-tech-minded-climate-groups-see-covid-19-as-a-trial-run-for-massive-change,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d9f3620f49a80257edb4f2bef471dbb950deb13a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431757,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN635h,1587061944,Open Interest in CME Bitcoin Futures Rises 70% as Institutions Return to Market,"Open interest in bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has recovered significantly from the March lows, indicating a resurgence in institutions that want to buy the cryptocurrency.      As of Wednesday, open interest, or the number of futures contracts outstanding, was $181 million, a 70 percent increase from $106 million recorded on March 22.       The number stood at $196 million nine days ago. That was the highest since March 7, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      ""The growth in open interest from CME may indicate that entities from traditional finance are more open to add bitcoin exposure to their portfolios, whilst retail investors are seemingly more reluctant to indulge in the futures market,"" cryptocurrency platform Luno noted in its latest weekly market report.    An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said to confirm an upward trend. Put simply, bitcoin’s recent rally has legs.    Bitcoin futures listed on the CME are widely considered to be synonymous with the institutional activity and macro traders. The CME is the largest futures exchange in the world, providing institutions access to derivatives on equities, commodities, foreign exchange pairs and bonds, and was one of the first exchanges to launch bitcoin futures in December 2017.      Open interest had dropped sharply from $316 million to $107 million during the three weeks to March 12, as institutions treated bitcoin as a source of liquidity during the coronavirus-led ""Black Thursday"" crash in the global equity markets. Investors generally prefer to hold cash, mainly U.S. dollars, during a crisis situation.      The financial markets have stabilized somewhat over the last couple of weeks, mainly due to the unprecedented monetary and fiscal lifelines launched by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government. The S&P 500 is currently reporting a rise of more than 25 percent from the multi-year low of 2,192 registered on March 24.    Rising interest, rising price    Bitcoin has seen a solid price rally over the past four weeks. The cryptocurrency is trading near $7,050 at press time, representing an 82 percent increase on the low of $3,867 reached on March 12, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The price rise is accompanied by an uptick in open interest in futures listed on the CME, as noted earlier. Total open interest on other major exchanges including Bakkt, Kraken, ByBit, Huobi, BitMEX, OKEx, Deribit, Binance, FTX and Bitfinex also increased, from $1.7 billion on March 13 to $2.3 billion on March 15.       An increase in open interest along with an increase in price is said to confirm an upward trend. Put simply, bitcoin’s recent rally has legs.      The rally is said to be driven by short covering, or bears taking profits, when the price increase is accompanied by a drop in open interest, and it is often short-lived.     Futures trading volume drops    Some observers, especially chart analysts, look at the trading volumes to confirm price trends. Trading volume refers to the number of contracts traded during a given period of time.      A rise in volume along with a rise in price is said to validate the uptrend. However, in bitcoin’s case trading volumes are on a declining trend, as seen below.       Total daily trading volume in futures listed across the globe topped out above $45 billion in mid-March and stood below $10 billion on Wednesday. Meanwhile, daily volume fell to a 4.5-month low of $83 million in CME’s futures, according to Skew data.      See also: Bitcoin Price Spikes Above $7.1K, Liquidating $23M on BitMEX      Hence, chart analysts may put a question mark on the sustainability of the recent price rally.      However, futures trading volume has dropped amid a rise in open interest. “It is often the result of investors holding on to their positions,” said Emmanuel Goh, CEO of Skew, in a Telegram chat in February, when the futures market was facing a similar situation.      In such cases, the market usually extends the preceding move, which is bullish in this case.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/16/open-interest-in-cme-bitcoin-futures-rises-70-as-institutions-return-to-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f8cff1abe1f3f7b53d5fdd4726c843d55da7034c-1200x792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431749,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62lh,1587059272,BTCPay Looks to Anonymize Bitcoin Transactions With PayJoin Integration,"BTCPay, a popular open source tool for accepting bitcoin payments, is turning to PayJoin for preserving the privacy of those transactions.      PayJoin (also called P2EP) is a relatively new way to send private transactions in bitcoin and may offer better privacy than current popular alternatives such as CoinJoin. Having BTCPay on board gives PayJoin a major boost in recognition that could translate into broader use of the privacy technology by other firms.      BTCPay developer Andrew Camilleri told CoinDesk the company plans to release an ""initial"" version of the P2EP privacy feature built into BTCPay on Thursday. He and BTCPay lead developer Nicholas Dorier have been the main contributors to the code.      Open source BTCPay is used by a range of merchants as a way of accepting bitcoin and lightning payments.      ""Our mission is financial sovereignty for everyone and PayJoin is a great tool to help break blockchain analysis heuristics and achieve that. Since BTCPay is so widely used, it should help jumpstart usage,"" Camilleri told CoinDesk.      Read more: This App Tracks the Impact of Your Donation to Combat Coronavirus      The work has been sponsored by Blockstream for the past several months to help Camilleri focus on the PayJoin changes.      ""We're hoping to improve the privacy and fungibility of bitcoin by accelerating the adoption of P2EP. If enough wallets and businesses support P2EP, it could provide the critical mass needed to achieve widespread financial privacy,"" said Blockstream Chief Strategy Officer Samson Mow.    Not as private    CoinJoin is the main privacy tool used these days, in part because it is used by wallets Wasabi and Samourai, making it much easier for people to use.      CoinJoin allows multiple people to mix their bitcoin transactions together, making it less obvious who owns which bitcoin. While it helps users to maintain their privacy, one of the main issues is it's easy to see when a bunch of users have done a CoinJoin simply by looking at the blockchain.      Bitcoin researcher Paul Sztorc likened the technology to ""wearing a ski mask to an indoor mall.""      The main benefit of PayJoin's ConJoin implementation, on the other hand, is that once done, the transactions look the same as other transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain.      So instead of many senders mixing their transactions, only the sender and receiver mix a transaction.    Ultimately we need to make a choice on what kind of world we want to live in, one where there is financial privacy or one where there isn’t.    It ""breaks blockchain analysis heuristics,"" Camilleri said. Blockchain analytics companies are able to glean certain transaction criteria to guess (often correctly) if bitcoins belong to the same owner, or to see if the transaction was a part of a CoinJoin.      ""Bitcoin's our chance for a logical and fair form of money. Companies that offer services that enable others to discriminate are essentially destroying that chance,"" Camilleri said.      One disadvantage, however, is both the sender and receiver have to support PayJoin.      ""Merchant payment processor support for P2EP made perfect sense. P2EP requires the sender and receiver to both be online. If you're sending, you're naturally online, and merchants have to be online all the time,"" Mow said.    What's next    PayJoin has been around since 2018, but not a lot of services have added support for it yet. Both the sender and receiver need to support the standard, but most wallets don't support it right now.      ""The current active implementations only allow you to do PayJoins between the same wallets, which is a bit too restrictive for widespread usage. There's nothing stopping any wallet or service from adding support for a universal PayJoin protocol now,"" Camilleri said.      This is one problem the project Snowball is trying to solve by creating code allowing for PayJoin transactions that can be easily added to any bitcoin wallet. The developers behind it plan to eventually open ""pull requests"" with suggested code to popular bitcoin wallets, to help get the ball rolling by encouraging them to adopt the privacy feature, and making it as easy as possible to do so.      Read more: Solana Blockchain Adds Korean Stablecoin Terra for Better Payments      Blockstream plans to further spur adoption of PayJoin. For now, it is working on adding PayJoin support to the bitcoin wallet Blockstream Green.      ""The next interesting step would be for an exchange to support P2EP. Ultimately we need to make a choice on what kind of world we want to live in, one where there is financial privacy or one where there isn't,"" Mow said.      ""Money needs to be private and fungible in order for it to be a 'good' money,"" he added. ""With bitcoin, every transaction is open for anyone to see, so we still have a lot of work to do to get it there. Without privacy and fungibility, money can be used as a tool for oppression or financial surveillance.

42431763,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN639h,1587058845,Blockchain Bites: Ethereum's Inroads and Libra's Concessions,"The world's second-largest blockchain by market capitalization is making major inroads despite the new coronavirus-led market turmoil.      The total amount of value transfer on the network has reached parity with Bitcoin, while dapp usage is reported to have surged 64 percent in Q1. Still, crypto isn't confined to the major chains: With Quora finding a use case for charity and Solana entering the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) with a stablecoin integration, decentralized tech continues to earn its reputation as a disruptor.      You're reading Blockchain Bites, the daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news, and why they're significant. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk's newsletters here. Here's the story:    Top Shelf    Ethereum's Inroads    Data shows the total value transferred on the Ethereum network, including ether and ERC-20 stablecoins, now matches that of the Bitcoin network, according to Messari research. ""Ethereum is becoming the dominant value transfer layer in crypto,"" Ryan Watkins, research analyst at Messari, said.  DappRadar found Ethereum saw a 64 percent increase in dapp usage in the first three months of 2020, outpacing other “layer-one” blockchains like Tron and EOS. (Decrypt)  Chainlink’s link token, which funds a system of oracles built on top of the Ethereum blockchain, is outperforming Bitcoin by leaps and bounds as the oracle network’s various use cases garner investor attention, leading to a self-feeding bullish cycle. ""Link has a strong fan base that constantly promotes or ‘shills’ the project to potential buyers. This often creates a positive reinforcement cycle, further driving up the price,"" Connor Abendschein, crypto research analyst at Digital Assets Data, said.    Libra's Concession In a major concession to global regulators, the Libra Association is pulling back from its original vision of a digital currency backed by a basket of national currencies. The Facebook-led consortium now plans to develop a handful of stablecoins each representing a different national currency, which will back their multi-currency stablecoin, rather than holding fiat currencies directly in a bank. The new model limits libra’s flexibility, since adding (or removing) a currency from the basket requires issuing (or retiring) another digital token, but still maintains its blockchain-based tech stack.      Institutional Investors The crypto-focused investment firm Grayscale raised a total of $503.7 million in the first quarter, primarily from institutional investors looking to take advantage of market turbulence. While bitcoin-weighted trusts continue to be the company's most popular product, the report noted that ether trusts also received record inflows in the same quarter as investors added multiple Grayscale products to their portfolios.      UBI-light Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang argues the one-time $1,200 federal stimulus paid to American citizens is not enough to curtail the financial hardship caused by the COVID-19 crisis. An advocate for universal basic income, Yang is instead throwing his support behind continuing payments of $2,000 monthly checks until the crisis is well and truly over.      Hermit Kingdom The United States government has outlined an aggressive set of countermeasures it said could stymie North Korea’s highly lucrative and often cryptocurrency-dependent global cybercrime campaigns. This includes implementing tough anti-money-laundering frameworks for digital currency, expelling North Korean IT workers, following best cyber practices, and communicating with law enforcement. The Hermit Kingdom is thought to have accrued a $1.5 billion cryptocurrency warchest, which could fund the regime’s development of weapons of mass destruction.      Stable Partners    Solana, a blockchain that aims to function at ""web-scale,"" is partnering with Terra to launch its first stablecoin to facilitate a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. ""By bringing stablecoins onto our network, we aim to dramatically expand the design space for developers, opening the door to novel applications that require price-stable payments,"" the Solana team wrote in a draft blog post.  Crypto custodian BitGo has acquired Lumina to increase its cryptocurrency offerings as it transitions to its role as a “full service” crypto firm. (Fortune)    Series B Swiss holding company Crypto Finance AG has closed a $14.5 million Series B funding round co-led by Swiss investor Rainer-Marc Frey, Beijing-based private equity firm Lingfeng Capital and joined by Hong Kong’s QBN Capital. The funds will go towards fulfilling capital requirements for obtaining a broker-dealer license from the Swiss financial regulator FINMA.      Wallet Mimicker An unknown hacker is exploiting trust in well-known brands by creating fake cryptocurrency wallet extensions for Google Chrome that trick victims into disclosing sensitive information. As originally reported by ZDNet, Google has so far removed 49 extensions that mimic Ledger, Trezor, Jaxx, Electrum, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus, and KeepKey from its Chrome Web Store.      'Infectious' Giving IntellectEU, a New York software startup, has created a blockchain-based charity app that replicates viral transmission to spread the act of giving. The #SpreadLoveNotCorona web app encourages users to share a link to donate widely, recording each donation on the Corda blockchain, so a verifiable chain of giving can track who recruited whom.

(Modern Consensus)  A Florida judge said Craig Wright's objection to handing over crucial evidence regarding billions in bitcoin left her ""puzzled,"" as he seemed to argue the court should ""blindly accept"" everything he says. Wright claims to have access to 1.1 million bitcoin but has told the court he couldn't prove this as it would infringe on the privilege he has with a mysterious Kenyan lawyer known as Denis Mayaka, who is supposedly counsel for the Tulip Trust that holds the fortune.    3D Printing CoinDesk columnist Cathy Barrera thinks patent and intellectual property law is holding back the possibility of 3D printing to address a mismatch between supply and demand in vital protective and medical equipment.

42431758,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN637h,1587057710,Vinay Gupta's Big Idea: An Identity Layer for Your Things,"Vinay Gupta knows pandemics. And he knows how to deal with crises. When he researched the most effective way society should respond to flu-like outbreaks, Gupta identified a concept that had not yet gone mainstream, “social distancing,” and wrote that social distancing is “one of the few tangible measures an ordinary person can take to increase their odds of survival.” This sentence alone is not remarkable. What’s remarkable is that he wrote it in 2008.      Gupta, an old-school cypherpunk who helped launch Ethereum (serving as its release coordinator), has a long history of deep-thinking humanitarian projects, like his seminar Hope for the World, his work at the energy policy think tank Rocky Mountain Institute, and his invention of the Hexayurt – cheap, eco-friendly shelters for refugee camps and disaster relief. (If you’ve been to Burning Man, you’ve seen one.)      Now he’s focused on his new startup, Mattereum. A few weeks before COVID-19 shut down life as we know it, I caught up with Gupta at ETH Denver to explore how, exactly, Mattereum would change the world.      See also: Jeff Wilser Talks With Erik Voorhees - Within Five Years There Will Be a Major Financial Meltdown and Crypto Will Be Ready      And just what is Mattereum? In a novella-length manifesto, Gupta describes the project as a “companion to projects like uPort and SOVRIN – a digital identity layer for Ethereum, but for things instead of people.” The core concept: all physical objects of value would have “digital twins” that can be easily searched, tagged, classified, optimized, and – thanks to a clever system of smart contracts and Ricardian contracts – be bought and sold in a way that is legally binding in the real world. “Matter is worth more once it is searchable,” Gupta argues in the piece.      The document is a “manifesto” in the fullest sense, showcasing the sweeping range of Gupta’s intellect and interests. It plumbs the history of consumerism, engineering production and waste management, tossing in both deep-cut references to Sigmund Freud’s nephew (Edward Bernays) and nods to “Fight Club.” Gupta on the early days of aircraft production: “Everything was hand-tuned. Even the SR71, the most advanced plane imaginable in the 1950s, was hand-made. Gigantic sheets of titanium in fifty thousand ton presses still varied enough that essentially every one of the 32 SR71s created was unique and had to be maintained individually…” (There are many passages like this.)      The sheer volume can be dizzying. And yet there seems to be something of a paradox: As Mattereum rolled out in 2019, the focus seemed to be on William Shatner’s involvement with… art collectibles? “Cryptonians!” Shatner tweeted on May 9, 2019. “My friends @VitalikButerin & @ElonMusk were trying to decide what to build on @Ethereum. I’ve been waiting & waiting…I finally decided to do something myself. Join me!” When announcing his involvement, Shatner said Mattereum will help the collectibles space because “it can mean the difference between a priceless, future heirloom and worthless fake.”      No shots at Shatner, but authenticating ""Star Trek"" memorabilia seems to be a far cry from the loftier goals of Gupta’s manifesto, which includes helping to “deliver sustainable abundance to all of humanity.”      I wanted to, as Gupta would say in the manifesto, “square this circle.” How, exactly, do we connect the seemingly mundane (but legitimate) act of improving collectibles with the stated goal of delivering “a significant reduction of the environmental and social harms caused by inefficiencies in industrial capitalism, using the Ethereum blockchain”? To be more blunt: Much of the blockchain space is hyperbole and bluster and pipe dreams, but Vinay Gupta is none of those things – he’s a man who actually gets things done. So I wanted to hear, directly from Gupta, how Mattereum would actually connect the dots between Kirk action figures and cracking the world’s sustainability problem.      Gupta’s response? Mattereum could provide 10 percent, and maybe 15 percent, of all of the unmet needs of humanity… and the solution to this puzzle is in your garage.    A quick note on the timing: We met in February, so in a throwback to what feels like a long-ago era, our conversation is coronavirus-free. Since then, Mattereum has provided a gamut of COVID-19 resourceshttps://mattereum.com/corporate-social-responsibility/. The interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.    CoinDesk: How do we get from William Shatner and art auctions to the *big picture* goals of Mattereum, like helping millions of refugees?      Gupta: The first-world application is where you make the money and you refine the design. That's our collectibles. It's fine art. It's wine. Next year it will be electronics and phones and all the rest of that stuff. But once those systems are slick and up and running, that’s how you then find a 10-millimeter wrench in a refugee camp.      So the first wave is fine arts? And the second wave is cameras, cars, electronics?       Gupta: This year will be arts and collectibles, next year will be things that are mass-produced like cameras, cars and electronics.       And the third wave helps out refugees?       Gupta: So once you've got the ability to track all the matter and all the property rights associated with the matter, and once you get good at that, over the next 10 years, the price will drop to the point where, if you're doing something like large-scale refugee relief, every single physical object that's been paid for with aid money gets a tracker.     It's so hard to explain, because it cuts so deep into people's idea about the structure of the world.    How does that work, exactly?       Gupta: So [it starts] with digital identities for physical things. Once you've got digital identity for physical things, then it's a question of what kind of information you put into that portfolio. For fine art, it's the authentication, it's the provenance, it's all the rest of that stuff. For mass-produced items, specification is super important. Does this SD card fit into this camera and allow it to record 4K video at 60 frames?       How is that different from, say, eBay? What’s the value over that?       Gupta: Most of the information on eBay isn't good. I don't know how much you use eBay. [Laughs.]       Not much, really. Fair.       Gupta: There's also the fact that even if you, as the [eBay] seller, happen to be perfect, and even if you're some crystal clear angelic channel of truth, everyone else is lying. So I have no way of trusting you.       See also: Tencent, Fidelity Back $20 Million Round for Blockchain Firm Everledger      How does Mattereum crack the problem?       Gupta: So now we get a third party involved. The third party looks at the goods. The third party sells me information about the goods in the form of a warranty, and you sell me the physical goods. That gets rid of the conflict of interest, because that third party’s job is to tell the damn truth. They don't get paid for the object sale.       How did they get paid?       Gupta: When I'm about to buy the object, I pay them for the warranty information. If the object arrives and is not as warrantied, I claim on that.      So you’re basically just buying a warranty?       Gupta: It's multiple third parties that sell you a warranty, telling you exactly what the object is like. They're not guaranteeing its future performance. They're telling you this really is a Stradivarius violin. They're telling you this really is a Cortina cylinder head gasket.       Those third-party promises break the logjam that's caused by the fact that the seller is wearing two hats. [Normally] they have the goods and also they describe the goods to you, so they’re incentivized to distort. These third parties are not incentivized to distort.       You’re saying there’s something fundamentally flawed with the classic, two-party system of buyers and sellers? That’s actually a bit more “disruptive,” if you will, than I thought.       Gupta: Yes, absolutely.       I don't think that's been fully appreciated, from what I've seen online.       See also: Everledger Looks Beyond Blood Diamonds With ESG Supply Chain Collaboration      Gupta: No. It's so hard to explain, because it cuts so deep into people's idea about the structure of the world. If we explain to people what we're doing at that level, their eyes glaze over. Because believe it or not, that's only the thin edge of the wedge.       What do you mean?       Think about object pricing. Here we have an object. You and I both think that this is worth $1,000 if it’s as described. But I think there's a one-third chance that you're going to oversell it. And you think there's a one in 20 chance I'm going to screw you on eBay and just refuse... like go raise a dispute and then not pay.       I'm with you.       Gupta: So if you [the buyer] risk-compensate a 30 percent chance of the thing being fake, you'll only pay $700. And if I risk-compensate because there's a one in 20 chance you'll screw me using the eBay dispute system, I want $1050. So there's now a $350 gap, which means we can't do the trade. Too big a gap.       So now Bob comes along with an insurance policy and he's, like, ‘I’ve examined the goods. I'm going to sell you a warranty on how this thing works. That's gonna cost you $30 and you guys can split it 50/50. And that will then bring your price estimates together, because it will get the fraud out of the equation.’ We can each pay $15 to do the deal at $1,000, or we can not pay the $15 and not do the deal. Well, if we wanna do the deal, it's worth that small overhead to sell the risk to somebody who wants it.       I see how that might help in super-expensive things, like fine arts. But can you give another example of how this would add value in reality?       Gupta: So take electronics. Let’s say you buy a Mac. You'll buy it and then you'll use it for a while and then you'll sell it. And then you'll buy another one. Because there's so much distrust in the secondhand market, the prices are lower than they ought to be, because of the doubt discount.       When you first bought the Mac, it cost you $2,000. You know if you're going to sell it, you'll only get 1,000 bucks for it. So for you, your effective cost is $1,000. If the doubt discount is entirely removed, on the secondhand market, it might sell for $1,600. So you won't be paying $1000, your effective cost is only $400, based on the high quality of information in the secondary markets.       Ah, I’m starting to see where this is going…       Gupta: It took five incredibly smart people two years to figure this out. We don't expect people to get it immediately, which is why we're starting with collectibles and toys. It's the thin end of the wedge. But it goes from toys being reused to nuclear power stations in a few years.       How so?       Gupta: Imagine that the laptop is now six or eight years old, and it has been sold a third time, fourth time, fifth time. It has gone through a bunch of hands. On eBay, its value is $50. It’s just a hunk of junk because at that point, you've got no accurate information about it, other than its model name and year. You look at that laptop and you think, hunk of junk.     We're going to go through areas where there are big glaring problems, and work our hardest at solving those problems. So for about a year, it's going to look like a really, really weird high-end flea market.    Now if somebody who actually knows old laptops looks at that, and says, “We've swapped out the SSD for a new SSD. And we've upgraded it to Windows 10, and it has a current license.” That machine is fully useful, and it goes from $50 to $250. What happens [today] is that objects lose so much trust and so much information that they wind up in the landfill while they're still useful.       So the idea is that by restoring trust to previously assumed useless items, you're squeezing more use out of them?       Gupta: You're tying the object back to the story. The object and the object's data get reunited.       [Editor’s note: This is the “digital twin” concept.]       But I would think that things like laptops only make up a small slice of landfills…       Gupta: Oh yes. I mean, landfills…it's entirely things like plastic cups and napkins.       So the bulk of the landfill problem won’t be dented by this, right?       Gupta: The landfill problem is not the problem we're solving here. The problem we're solving is all of the people who want laptops but can't afford them. There's a huge unfilled need for stuff in society. And we're not reaching that need because the stuff is being roped into landfill rather than being roped into people who want to buy them.       And this is only the first of the three things we do. So the asset passport is the first brick. The second brick is a thing called an Automated Custodian, or an automated title holder. And the third is Smart Property Register. [Note: These are fully explained in Gupta’s manifesto.]       This is all pretty abstract. How do you explain this to a mainstream audience?       Gupta: It's a lot of moving parts because it's in the abstract. Right? But if you’re a collector of ""Star Trek"" stuff, this becomes really concrete. Because you look on eBay. And you click on the asset passport link. And it comes up with a valid asset passport. And you put a nickel into the insurance contract. And then you buy the object.       In the next version, you take out the insurance contract, you push money into the smart contract. Now you own the object. So what happens is we gradually blockchain-ize more and more of the transactional space, until eventually, what you wind up with is an API attached to every physical object of value, and you can just push data and money into the API to control the asset.       When do you think that will happen?       Gupta: I think we will have a limited form of that done in the next year for sure, and very plausibly this year, depending on our fund-raising.       How about at scale?       Gupta: There's a kind of dot-com rubric which is, “It's better that 1,000 people love what you do, than 10,000 be kind of lukewarm.” So I think we’re going to go through collectibles. We’re going to go through wine. Antiques. We're going to go through areas where there are big glaring problems, and work our hardest at solving those problems. So for about a year, it's going to look like a really, really weird high-end flea market.       And how does it expand beyond those high-end niche items?       Gupta: I think the place where this will really show up in most people’s lives is... I don't have a good generic name for this yet, but let's say “experimental clutter.”       How so?       Gupta: Let’s say you got it into your head you want to go fly fishing. So you buy a bunch of fly fishing gear. You spend about a year and a half fly fishing. Then you discover that fly fishing is kind of time consuming. And you’re a bit busy because you've got a new baby.       Ah, right, this reminds me of how in the 1980s, everyone bought dumb infomercials for things like Thighmasters and then the Thighmasters languished in the attic, never used.       Gupta: [Laughs.] That's the one. Precisely. So all of that stuff, you buy it as an experiment. I'm the kind of person who does this all the time. And the liquidity crisis on the second-hand sale costs you 50, 60, 80 percent of the object's value, often to the point where it's no longer worth trying to sell the damn thing.       But I’m still fuzzy on the mechanics. In the case of the fly fishing rod, do you have some actual person, like a bored teenager, who’s like, “I’m going to come to your attic and verify that this thing is in good condition?”       Gupta: Start simpler. Think of Patagonia. You know Patagonia?       Sure. We’re in Denver, after all. [Note: Patagonia jackets are to Denver what body paint is to Burning Man.]       Gupta: So if every Patagonia jacket has an “asset passport,” you walk into the store with your used Patagonia jacket. They spend a minute and a half looking it over to verify the condition. Patagonia stamps your asset passport and now you sell it on eBay.       Got it. So maybe you have a “hub” of authorizers…       Gupta: Yeah, that's right. And a lot of those people will be experts in the field. So if you're doing things like collectibles –       They’re almost like notaries!       Gupta: Almost like notaries. Bingo.     We gradually blockchain-ize more and more of the transactional space, until eventually, what you wind up with is an API attached to every physical object of value, and you can just push data and money into the API to control the asset.    This could even be a gig for people.       Gupta: Yes! Boom!       They're experts, and they have their expert shop.       Gupta: Yes, yes, yes!       People come to this shop to get their asset passport “stamped.” To get credentials.       Gupta: Passport “stamped”! That’s a good way of putting it. We're taking that.       It’s yours! Okay, I’m getting this now. What would you say is the biggest risk for not scaling?       Gupta: You know, [P.T.] Barnum said, “Nobody ever went broke underestimating the American public.” The strong possibility is people just don't care at scale. So we might wind up in a position where we rule very lucrative corners, like French wine older than 30 years. But younger wine than that, people are just willing to take their chances. So it might be something where we get stuck at the high end, and it's hard for us to push that.       So what’s the endgame? Boosting the value of the secondary market?       Gupta: If you make the secondary market efficient, the goods are used till the end of life. How many of our goods are actually used till the end of life? Most of it winds up sitting in attics, or being thrown away. Or it winds up in thrift stores, where it sells for 1 percent of what it's worth. So all of that structural inefficiency goes away when you just maintain a record of what the damn thing is. See what I'm saying?       Kind of. How does this get back to the refugee camps?       Gupta: So think of those inventory screens that you get in [Massively Multiplayer Online games]. You never wind up with a thing in the MMO inventory where you’ve forgotten where it is, because the bloody computer keeps track of all your assets. And that's just how property should work.      Now take your refugees camps. All the property in the camp is tagged, which means we don't need 14 10-millimeter wrenches. We need three. Because when you need one, you can send a message directly to the person who currently has it, and you can pay the contract price for buying or renting a wrench from them.      And what’s the connection to helping the environment?      Gupta: What we're talking about doing is unpacking the destructive part of consumer society, the part where we make things usable and throw them away like they're junk – when they're not junk – is a vast unnecessary river of damage.      We've got enormous numbers of poor people in this society that would love access to that stuff. But eBay is so flaky. And charity shops are such an enormous waste of resources that a lot of times people are just throwing stuff away.      The actual conscious, active re-utilization of things that people no longer desire is incredibly slack. And if we tighten that up, there's no environmental impact associated with the satisfying of those human needs, because all the impact was when the thing was first made. The second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth uses, these are free environmentally.      [Laughs a bit.]      You see how this looks like an enormous free lunch?      It does indeed.      Gupta: Yeah. We nearly fell off our goddam chairs when we figured this out. When I sat down to present my conclusions to the team, I was like, “Guys, there's like 20 percent of the global economy sitting inside of people's garages and boxes they haven't opened in 10 years.”      So let’s imagine the big picture, the “pie of needs” of all the people in the world. What slice of the pie could be cut with this?      Gupta: My guess is it's as big as 10 percent. It might be 15 percent.      Are you not worried about forkage? What are your barriers to entry?      Gupta: So right now, the main barrier to entry is that no one is taking it seriously. In the long run, I expect that we'll have 10 to 20 percent of the market, which is basically five to ten times the size of Visa. We're certainly not going to be the last people in the world to do this.      UPDATE: Since our conversation, a far more topical – if tragic – example of Mattereum use case has emerged: ventilators.      In a March 20 Medium post (""Reliably solving the ventilator crisis?"") Gupta writes, “The challenge here is ensuring that the ventilators, oxygenators, masks and other equipment produced meets the necessary functionality, reliability and quality standard required to save lives, and figuring out what to do when they do not.”      In other words, it would be helpful to have the “Authenticator,” or “Asset Passport,” like in our above examples of laptops, Patagonia jackets or ""Star Trek"" collectibles. “These auxiliary [ventilator] manufacturers have a steep learning curve ahead of them, and it is important that they nail it and are able to prove that their products are ready to save lives,” Gupta writes. “It’s realistic but not yet certain that the Mattereum Asset Passport could help them do this.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/16/vinay-guptas-big-idea-an-identity-layer-for-your-things,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2ed6af96830ccb6b825b00e85d20f029fa0fc689-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62xh,1587055856,'Digital Dollar' Reintroduced by US Lawmakers in Latest Stimulus Bill,"The concept of a digital dollar that can be used to provide U.S. taxpayers with stimulus payments to weather the economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has once again been floated by lawmakers.      Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) introduced a new proposal to have the federal government issue $2,000 per month to residents by minting a pair of $1 trillion coins and using these to back the payments. The Automatic BOOST to Communities Act (ABC Act) also brings back the idea of a digital dollar, describing the concept using similar language to a series of bills introduced last month.      Under the ABC Act, Congress would authorize the Federal Reserve to create “FedAccounts,” meaning “Digital Dollar Account Wallets,” which would allow U.S. residents, citizens and businesses located in the country to access financial services.      Read More: How a Flurry of ‘Digital Dollar’ Proposals Made It to Congress      “No later than January 1, 2021, the Secretary shall offer all recipients of BOOST payments the option to receive their payments in digital dollar wallets,” Thursday’s bill read.      The bill was introduced in the wake of ongoing issues with issuing $1,200 stimulus payments authorized under the CARES Act. The Internal Revenue Service has been sending payments to taxpayers, but glitches have prevented numerous individuals from receiving their funds – or even from being able to verify their payment status, the Washington Post reported Thursday.    Multiple mentions    The digital dollar idea first appeared in the original form of the “Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act” introduced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the “Financial Protections and Assistance for America’s Consumers, States, Businesses, and Vulnerable Populations Act” introduced by House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), envisioning a “FedAccount” system wherein the Federal Reserve – the U.S. central bank – would manage bank accounts for every resident, allowing it to directly deposit these payments.      Notably, these digital dollars are not stablecoins and do not appear to be based on a blockchain infrastructure of any sort.      The digital dollar mentions were removed from the subsequent version of the “Take Responsibility” act, and it is unclear whether Waters’ bill made much progress.      Read More: The Overton Window Opens for a Digital Dollar      The idea was also brought up in an independent Senate bill introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the ranking member on the Committee for Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. While the Senate is in recess, an individual familiar with the senator’s thinking said his office still intended to pursue the legislation.    Beyond payments    Thursday’s bill goes beyond just stimulus payments, however. The bill notes that FedAccount holders should have access to a variety of other services if it is passed, including “debit cards, online account access, automatic bill-pay, mobile banking and automatic teller machines maintained in conjunction with the United States Postal Services at its physical locations.”      Thursday’s bill was co-sponsored by Reps. Jesús García (D-Ill.), Alcee Hastings (D-Fla.), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Nydia Velázquez (D-NY) and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.).      The news comes just hours after the Libra Association announced it was modifying its white paper and plan for the libra stablecoin. The entity, spawned by Facebook last year, now envisions launching a series of fiat-pegged stablecoins rather than just one multi-currency-backed token.      The libra project was originally intended to help facilitate financial services for unbanked and underbanked individuals through the use of a digital transfer mechanism.      Morgan Ricks, an associate professor at Vanderbilt University who helped provide input on the original digital dollar proposals, told CoinDesk that he and his associates have ""given advice at the staff level"" to both House and Senate offices over the past few weeks.

42431743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62dh,1587053376,Coinbase Custody Doubles Down on DeFi Governance Options,"Coinbase Custody is making it easier for its clients to vote their tokens on more decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, starting with Compound. The new tools were announced Thursday.      “A year ago, people put their assets in Custody to put them in cold storage and not interact with them much,” said Coinbase product manager Bryce Ferguson. “Now they can stake, vote or do whatever innovative thing those assets offer. … We worked really close with regulators to bring this to market.”      The move is meant to get more voter involvement from Coinbase Custody clients, since DeFi ecosystems have seen notoriously low participation rates to date. Diversification is imperative if DeFi is ever to realize its “decentralized” ethos.      Coinbase’s venture arm invested in Compound Finance starting in 2018. Compound’s 2019 Series A included the Andreessen Horowitz a16z crypto fund, Polychain Capital and Paradigm Capital, all of which are also heavily involved in the Ethereum-centric MakerDAO ecosystem. Polychain and Paradigm are helmed by members of the so-called “Coinbase Mafia.”      Thousands of people now buy assets affiliated with the DeFi ecosystem, including ether, dai, Compound’s cTokens and the MakerDAO voting token MKR. Coinbase Custody clients have been able to vote their MKR tokens without moving them out of storage since last October.      “Coinbase Custody is currently the only custody provider and the only in-app voting experience for Compound,” Coinbase said in a press statement.    Demanding participation    But this isn’t just Coinbase scratching its own itch. There is retail demand for staking and governance features directly in wallet or exchange accounts.      Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin tweeted on Tuesday he’s also interested in the idea of mobile staking options for the upcoming Eth 2.0 revamp. Plus, this week the wallet startup Ledger announced self-custodied staking options for Tron’s TRX, the wallet’s second staking token after Tezos. The complementary Ledger Live mobile app went live in January 2019 and has since staked 49 million Tezos tokens, XTZ, second only to Coinbase.      Coinbase offers Tezos staking through its mobile app as well, since November 2019, and is currently the world’s largest Tezos validator. According to Ferguson, Coinbase now has roughly 60 million tokens ($120 million) staked.      Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier said staking and governance features, even direct smart-contract access like Compound offers, are on the roadmap some time after this sprint focused on Tron.      Among decentralized applications (dapps), Tron dapps are the most popular options in 2020. The blockchain analytics startup Dapp.com’s Q1 2020 report said Tron dapps saw an average of 21,606 users a day last quarter, with the vast majority being “high risk” gambling games.      In terms of Ethereum users, Dapp.com estimated Compound is the third most popular dapp, garnering fewer users but higher volumes. Combined with MakerDAO, the fifth most popular protocol by transaction volume, Dapp.com estimated both DeFi systems had under 2,000 daily users on April 15.      “In the short term, we probably think about DeFi more than anything else,” Ledger’s Gauthier said. “The space is growing so much no one is really competing against anyone right now. Everyone is growing.”      Likewise, both Gauthier and Coinbase’s Ferguson said they are closely monitoring Eth 2.0 developments, as any future assets may have either voting or staking features as well.      “In the long term we think about our role toward the user, the fact that we need to make it as secure and easy as possible,” Gauthier said, adding these coin features were inspired by user demand.",POSITIVE,MKR,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MKR | WALLET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/16/coinbase-custody-doubles-down-on-defi-governance-options,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b54014e107eaf02b77de0d2fcebe2cf0edf05b6-1420x923.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62hh,1587047455,EPAM Joins Effort to Help Cryptocurrency Exchanges Comply With FATF 'Travel Rule',"Software and digital platform provider EPAM Systems has joined forces with an association working to help crypto exchanges comply with tough rules laid out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).      EPAM, which provides digital products across a range of industries including finance, joined OpenVASP as an association member on Thursday, pledging to use its programming expertise to help crypto businesses comply with the FATF's ""Travel Rule.""      In June 2019, the FATF – an international money laundering watchdog – updated Recommendation 16 of the Travel Rule, which relates to the way in which data of the sender a financial transaction and its beneficiary is policed during wire transfers.      The rule change, which caused an outcry in the crypto industry, meant digital asset transactions at exchanges and similar entities – ""Virtual Asset Service Providers"" (VASPs) to use the FATF's parlance – were included as well.      In effect, transaction data above a certain threshold should be stored by VASPs for potentially sharing with other VASPs, as well as regulators and policing authorities, bringing a large compliance burden and raising potential privacy issues. While the FATF rules are guidance for the globe's regulators, nations that do not fall into line risk being blacklisted.      See also: Binance Throws Weight Behind Shyft Network in ‘Travel Rule’ Standards Race      Since the 2019 ruling, crypto businesses have been trying to figure out how to comply with the Travel Rule.      The OpenVASP initiative, launched in November, seeks to provide a clear picture of FATF compliance based on an open-source protocol allowing for secure communication of sender and beneficiary information for crypto-asset transactions between VASPs.      That's where EPAM's induction into OpenVASP may help. The company aims to develop a second implementation of the protocol in Java to further help Virtual Asset Service Providers such as brokers, exchanges and banks, comply with the rule.      EPAM's implementation will follow the C# implementation already being developed OpenVASP founding members such as Bitcoin Suisse, Lykke, Seba Bank, Sygnum Bank, MME Legal and Avaloq.      See also: Inside the Standards Race for Implementing FATF’s Travel Rule      “With alternative crypto assets becoming more mainstream, there is a need in the market to align investors, market participants and regulations to a common standard,” said Balazs Fejes, co-head of global business at EPAM, in a press release.      “OpenVASP provides a transparent, trusted protocol for reporting crypto-asset transactions, and we are pleased to partner with the association to support the open-source community and provide an innovative solution to this challenge,” Fejes added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/04/16/epam-joins-effort-to-help-cryptocurrency-exchanges-comply-with-fatf-travel-rule,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8aff40c7566ee9ad1dc0db9aeff7a592dc60147-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431748,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62rh,1587045600,Libra Scales Back Global Currency Ambitions in Concession to Regulators,"The Libra Association is pulling back from its original vision of a global digital currency backed by a basket of national currencies in a bid to appease global regulators.      The consortium set up last year by Facebook now plans to develop a handful of stablecoins each representing a different fiat currency. One libra coin could be tied to the U.S. dollar, for example, another to the euro and so on.      Libra still intends to issue a multi-currency stablecoin, but it would be backed by the new stablecoins, rather than directly by fiat currencies held in a bank. The new model arguably limits Libra’s flexibility, since adding (or removing) a currency from the basket requires issuing (or retiring) another digital token.      Read more: Libra Isn’t a Cryptocurrency. It’s a Glimpse of a New Asset Class      The pivot, announced Thursday, represents a major concession to governments and central bankers around the world who balked at Libra's original plan, partly out of concern it could undermine their monetary sovereignty.      ""The journey since the original white paper was released has really provoked an important conversation around the world about, 'How do we appropriately regulate digital payments and digital currencies?'"" Libra Association vice-chairman Dante Disparte said in an interview.      Unveiled in June 2019, the Libra Association was originally a collection of 28 organizations including credit card companies, tech giants and venture capital firms, all convened around blockchain technology created by Facebook designed to open up global payments, with an emphasis on the developing world.      Read more: Facebook Unveils Libra Cryptocurrency, Targeting 1.7 Billion Unbanked      However, Libra's model drew regulatory ire, particularly in the developed world. The watered-down version squares with reports by The Information in March and German publication FinanceFWD in January, which said the changes have been in the works since early 2020.      ""We remain committed to our goal of being ready to launch in 2020,"" a Libra spokesperson told CoinDesk.      Libra's new look    Libra will now mainly serve to make existing currencies easier to use, both in a peer-to-peer fashion and internationally, by emphasizing a series of stablecoins backed by sovereign currencies.      A cover letter to the revised Libra white paper released Thursday morning acknowledged widespread objections voiced by policymakers:    ""While our vision has always been for the Libra network to complement fiat currencies, not compete with them, a key concern that was shared was the potential for the multi-currency Libra Coin (≋LBR) to interfere with monetary sovereignty and monetary policy if the network reaches significant scale and a large volume of domestic payments are made in ≋LBR. We are therefore augmenting the Libra network by including single-currency stablecoins in addition to ≋LBR.""    As examples, the cover letter lists libra iterations based on the greenback, the euro, the British Pound and the Singapore Dollar.      ""Every stablecoin would be backed by a reserve of high-quality assets and short-term government securities such that their value is preserved,"" Disparte said. ""And we think this type of model improves the proximity to central banks and public institutions.""      While a multicurrency libra coin (≋LBR) will persist, it will only ever include a combination of those stablecoins, using a model emulating the International Monetary Fund's special drawing rights, much as the Saga stablecoin launched in early 2018 proposed.      A slide deck shown to CoinDesk during the conversation with Disparte said ≋LBR ""will not be a separate digital asset from the single-currency stablecoins.""      Further, the letter said, ""≋LBR can be used as an efficient cross-border settlement coin as well as a neutral, low-volatility option for people and businesses in countries that do not have a single-currency stablecoin on the network yet.""      Read more: Inside China’s Plan to Power Global Blockchain Adoption      A Silicon Valley crypto investor speaking on the condition of anonymity told CoinDesk that stablecoins have already proven to be a major source of success. For example, one of Ethereum's chief use cases has become a way to move stablecoins around.      While it's inevitable that major currencies such as the dollar will become digital, the investor said, some governments may realize they are better off effectively outsourcing that work to an entity like Libra rather than doing it in-house and having a Healthcare.gov-esque debacle.      The larger question, the investor argued, will be whether partners will want to stay engaged in a project whose business model is largely based on extremely conservative returns in a world where interest rates hover around 0 percent in a post-COVID-19 environment.      Read more: This Ethereum Lottery Perfectly Explains How Facebook’s Big Corporate Backers Will Profit From Crypto      Staying permissioned    In a further concession, the association's new white paper removes any mention of ever introducing permissionless participation in the Libra network. All counterparties operating nodes in the Libra network will remain known to all others.      ""Regulators raised thoughtful questions about the perimeter of control for the Libra network – in particular, the need to guard against unknown participants taking control of the system and removing key compliance provisions,"" the cover letter states.      The original white paper envisioned Libra starting out as a permissioned network controlled by the Association’s members, but there were explicit plans for Libra to become permissionless beginning in the next five years.      ""The idea there,"" Disparte said of the changes, ""is to have a model that has the best qualities of permissionless systems but really at all times knows who the counterparties are. So it's KYB, know-your-business and know-your-counterparty.""      The cover letter to the revised white paper also hints that the new roadmap will be more compliant with regulatory recommendations from Financial Action Task Force (FATF), by limiting what individuals and unregulated entities can do on the network. (The FATF formalized its guidelines for crypto businesses three days after Libra was unveiled in June.)      Read more: All Global Crypto Exchanges Must Now Share Customer Data, FATF Rules      ""Unhosted Wallets"" will be subject to balance and transaction limits, and initially, the network ""will only be accessible to"" virtual asset service providers (VASPs), the letter said, using the intergovernmental body's term for regulated crypto firms.      Of course, limiting the ability of unregulated parties to interact with the network may hamper Libra's stated goal of fostering financial inclusion.      Regulated in Switzerland    Material changes to its roadmap aside, the Libra Association is still looking for regulatory approvals to launch.      Disparte said the Libra Association has initiated the licensing process with Switzerland's Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FINMA), which would allow it to offer monetary and banking services.      ""One thing that's quite unique about how they [FINMA] have approached reviewing the Libra project and our licensing application is they've formed a regulatory and supervisory college which effectively comprises a range of countries and parties around the world,"" Disparte said. ""The value of that is to get to as close to a consensus approach to what really is an appropriate framework for managing these types of projects.""      The group also intends to register as a money services business (MSB) with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), typically a first step to offering currency exchange and transfer services in the U.S. (Libra told CoinDesk it does not intend to provide these services). Meanwhile, Facebook's blockchain subsidiary, Calibra, is already registered as an MSB.      Nevertheless: blockchain    The technology stack remains largely the same.      ""Obviously there's ongoing work with the Libra blockchain to ensure readiness,"" Disparte said. ""We are continuing that buildout of the blockchain and the technology supporting this and we want to flatten as much as possible the barriers to entry in this network to the open source world.""      Without permissionlessness, many in the industry would argue a classic centralized system would work as well or better, a point bitcoin advocate Jimmy Song has made repeatedly over the years.      Disparte defended the reliance on blockchain technology despite the fact that Libra will never be a truly open network by saying, ""PayPal bought Venmo many years ago, but a PayPal user can't pay a Venmo user, so there's no interoperability. I think that's where sticking to using blockchain in this construct really supports the free flow of Libra payments from person to person that by today's standards are not possible.""      This peer-to-peer payment element, Disparte argued, is only feasible under a blockchain architecture. ""So the Libra system's big breakthrough ... it's really the concept of a scalable peer-to-peer payment network, that doesn't sacrifice security,"" he said.      When Libra debuted last year, CoinDesk contacted various people in the industry to ask what they thought the potential of this new Facebook-birthed blockchain might be. Investor Naval Ravikant's opinion at that time has proven at least partly prescient.      ""I don't think it means much for crypto because it's not really (sovereign-resistant) crypto,"" Ravikant wrote.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/16/libra-scales-back-global-currency-ambitions-in-concession-to-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3121fc04ba429d9f733ff95fe7d1d5fd01149667-1918x1078.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto-focused investment firm raised a total of $503.7 million in Q1 2020, nearly double the previous quarterly high of $254.8 million reached in Q3 2019. While bitcoin-weighted trusts continue to be the company's most popular product, the report noted that ether trusts also received record inflows in the same quarter as investors added multiple Grayscale products to their portfolios.      The firm, a unit of New York-based Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk's parent company, raised about $600 million across the whole of 2019. With Thursday's report showing the company raising more than $500 million in Q1, it's likely 2020 inflows will exceed the year before.      See also: Grayscale to Fund Ethereum Classic Developers for 2 More Years      Grayscale also reported inflows surpassed $1 billion over a 12-month period, the company's first billion-dollar year. This takes the total value of Grayscale's assets under management (AUM) to $2.2 billion.      The lion's share of demand came from institutional investors, who made up 88 percent of total investments in the quarter. Digging deeper, Grayscale said the overwhelming majority of these institutional clients were hedge funds.

42431747,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62ph,1587040794,Judge 'Puzzled' by Craig Wright's Objections to Producing Evidence of Over 1.1M Bitcoin,"A federal judge said Craig Wright's objection to handing over crucial evidence regarding billions in bitcoin left her ""puzzled,"" as he seemed to be arguing the court should ""blindly accept"" everything he says.      District Judge Beth Bloom overruled Wright's objections to an Order of Discovery issued by another judge, compelling Wright to produce 11,000 documents for the Kleiman lawsuit. She said the defendant mischaracterized the order and relied on unsubstantiated arguments.      In a highly critical explanation for her decision for the Southern District Court of Florida, Bloom said it was the role of the presiding judge to determine what evidence was admissible in court. She ruled Wright's arguments that the documents would be inadmissible because they would disregard his attorney-client privilege was a mischaracterization.      The brother of Wright's deceased business partner is suing Wright for half of the 1.1 million bitcoin supposedly held in a joint mining venture known as the Tulip Trust. Based on today's price, the overall value of the bitcoin in question would be more than $7.7 billion, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      Wright has long claimed to have access to the bitcoin but has told the court he couldn't prove this as it would infringe on the privilege he has with a mysterious Kenyan lawyer known as Denis Mayaka, who is supposedly counsel for the Tulip Trust.      See also: UK Law Panel Defines Crypto Assets as Property      U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart had previously rejected these arguments and even questioned whether the lawyer exists. Kleiman's brother has further accused Wright of abusing attorney privilege to withhold evidence and ""obfuscate"" trial proceedings.      As Bloom said in this week's court order, Reinhart already highlighted Wright's relationship with this lawyer could not properly be authenticated. The evidence consists of a LinkedIn printout and typed declaration asserting he is counsel for the Trust. This ""could easily have been generated by anyone with word processing software and a pen,"" Reinhart had said.      In her reasons for overruling Wright's objections, Bloom said Reinhart ""was not clearly erroneous or acting contrary to law"" after he issued the discovery order. ""Defendant’s gripe, therefore, is not with the supposed exclusion of the evidence but instead with the weight assigned to it.""      Bloom said Reinhart's skepticism was justified on the basis of Wright's history of providing false evidence.      ""[T]he Court is puzzled by Defendant’s apparent argument that Judge Reinhart must blindly accept items produced by Defendant such that Judge Reinhart cannot rely on his past experiences with Defendant in this litigation (including his history of providing forged materials and giving perjured testimony) in evaluating whether Defendant has carried his burden as to privilege.""      ""That is not how fact-finding works,"" Bloom added.      See also: Mark Karpeles Accuses Plaintiff in Mt. Gox Lawsuit of Attempting to ‘Thwart’ Court      Bloom found nothing to support Wright's argument that producing the evidence would leave him in violation of Australian law. She also threw out claims the magistrate judge should have determined whether documents were relevant to the proceedings before ordering Wright to produce them in court.      The court order is the latest development in a long lawsuit characterized by bad blood on both sides. Wright was previously found to be in contempt of court, while just last month Reinhart criticized Kleiman's legal team for charging ""excessive fees"" that were to be paid by the defendant due to the drawn-out proceedings.      Wright now has until April 17 to produce the requested documents.

42431753,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN62zh,1587038400,This App Tracks the Impact of Your Donation to Combat Coronavirus,"Until recently, Thomas Bohner was following all the familiar coronavirus procedures: work from home, social distance, worry about everything. Then, one night over after-work online drinks a couple of weeks ago, he started brainstorming with his team about how to raise money for the coronavirus support effort.      Bohner’s team at IntellectEU, a New York software startup, had the idea of a crowdfunding application for charity. They divided tasks among themselves and hacked it together in fewer than 10 days.    The result is the #SpreadLoveNotCorona web apphttps://spreadlovenotcorona.io/our-faq, which digitally replicates the spreading of a virus. But instead of spreading illness, it scales its impact by encouraging donations to the U.N.’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund for the World Health Organization. Donations are recorded and their impact tracked using blockchain technology.    See also: Open Source PPE: Decentralizing Face Mask Production      “As a blockchain-focused company, we wanted to prove how quickly you can develop and deploy a blockchain-based application (in this case Corda),” Thomas Bohner, vice president of IntellectEU, told CoinDesk in an email.      The idea is fairly straightforward. You sign up to donate, create a username and then donate before sharing a link with others to encourage them to do the same. You can click here to view a full mock-up of the app, and click through it.      The giving started with “patient zero;” with “every infection, the tree branches out and becomes wider and deeper. In the context of our application this means more donations to charity, so the more the merrier,” writes Robbert Coeckelbergh in a Medium post about the app’s technological construct.    On a leaderboard on the app you can see how much specific usernames have raised, and who has gotten involved. The leaderboardhttps://spreadlovenotcorona.io/patjevincent is updated every five minutes; currently IntellectEU tops it, having raised over $400 and “infected” or involved 77 people.    Donations are logged and verified on the Corda blockchain, increasing transparency in the donation process.      “We store the proof-of-payment (without personally identifiable information), making it possible to go back in the chain and verify every and each donation,” Bohner said. “People can go back and check their impact of sharing their personal link. This query checks the blockchain and all donations linked to that ID. The immutability and audibility of the blockchain are key characteristics here.”      See also: Researchers Are Tapping Blockchain Tools in Fight Against Coronavirus      Thus far, the project has raised almost $3,000. The impact can be tracked on the app.      Bohner said the application was built to support COVID-19 but could be repurposed if nonprofits want to leverage it for another good cause such as local crowdfunding or tracking and tracing for medical supplies.      “We believe blockchain as a disruptive technology definitely attracts more people to the application and brings trust in the payment flow,” he said. “Traceability and transparency are becoming more key in the charity industry and blockchain can help.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/16/this-app-tracks-the-impact-of-your-donation-to-combat-coronavirus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/86aa7858de0933b2315916b68777593d5673249a-2560x2099.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431760,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN63Bh,1587037738,First Mover: Coronavirus Trillions Get Bitcoiners Wondering if Halving Still Matters,"Before the coronavirus hit, bitcoiners were looking forward to next month's ""halving"" – a once-every-four-years reduction in new supplies of the cryptocurrency – as the primary factor that would drive prices higher, potentially even a 13-fold increase from current levels.      Since the coronavirus pandemic hit, however, the market's focus has shifted instead to the trillions of dollars of emergency aid and money injections pledged by the world's governments and central banks. Those are seen as enhancing bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against inflation, similar to the traditional arguments for buying gold.      You're reading First Mover, CoinDesk's daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.  However, with bitcoin prices stagnating over the past week in a range between $6,600 and $7,200, well below the level predicted in many investors' halving-predicated models, some industry analysts have been wondering when, or even if, prices will take off. An even knottier quandary for bitcoin bulls looms if prices begin to tumble anew.  ""I don't want to say that this is going to be bitcoin's last stand, but it really is going to put the dominant investment narratives to the test,"" said Joshua Frank, CEO of TheTIE, a provider of data on digital assets.  An analysis published Wednesday by TheTIE and trading platform eToro showed that mentions of ""coronavirus"" are now appearing far more than ""halving"" or ""halvening"" in cryptocurrency-focused publications:      A related finding was that, since the beginning of March, ""gold"" is increasingly mentioned in headlines atop stories about bitcoin:      Early writings by Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, show that while the cryptocurrency network was designed to serve as a peer-to-peer electronic payment system, its resistance to inflation was considered a key attribute. Central banks have a long history of debasing their currencies, Nakamoto reportedly wrote in a February 2009 post.      The underlying blockchain network's original computer programming stipulated only 21 million bitcoins could ever be minted. The hard cap, the thinking goes, makes the cryptocurrency potentially more reliable as a store of value than gold, whose supply hinges mainly on the ability or willingness of miners to keep digging.      According to an International Monetary Fund blog post on Tuesday, governments around the world have now committed some $8 trillion to contain the coronavirus pandemic including higher spending, foregone tax revenue, loans, corporate bailouts and guarantees.      And in a report on Tuesday, Deutsche Bank tallied some $2.7 trillion in balance-sheet expansions by major central banks in the past few weeks. Some of those are tied to accelerated purchases of government bonds and other assets – a type of monetary stimulus known as ""quantitative easing,"" or QE, that was popularized in the years after the 2008 crisis by then-Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke.      ""If QE looks more obviously a cover for unsustainable fiscal policies and especially if the primary function appears to be longstanding debt monetization, currencies will suffer,"" wrote Alan Ruskin, a macro strategist for the German lender. ""Gold is a natural beneficiary of this latter-stage QE, and looks to be already anticipating this outcome.""      Cryptocurrency analysts have highlighted an increasing correlation between bitcoin and gold prices. Eyeballing the performance since the end of April, there is a synchronicity, but it's rough: Bitcoin surged, then fell back, while gold has continued to steadily climb.      Since the start of 2020, gold prices are up 13 percent, close to an eight-year high, while bitcoin is down 1.6 percent, with its price at just over half of the 2019 market peak around $13,000.      CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reported on Wednesday that bitcoin trading volumes have subsided following a surge in early- to mid-March, when prices were swinging wildly.      What does that suggest? Are bitcoin traders beset by a lack of conviction? Or are they unwilling to part with their bitcoin – HODLing, in crypto-speak – because they think the price is going up? It's safe to say that there are fewer buyers and fewer sellers.      In the meantime, signals from the cryptocurrency options market imply that traders see less than a 10 percent chance of bitcoin trading above $10,000 by December. The other 90 percent of outcomes would constitute a big disappointment for bitcoin bulls who were betting that the halving would drive prices to $90,000 or higher.      And with the coronavirus potentially pushing the global economy into its worst recession since the 1930s, traders in all financial markets – from the analog to the digital – now have a lot more to think about beyond the halving.      The Federal Reserve said Wednesday in its monthly ""Beige Book"" survey of regional economic conditions that leisure, hospitality and retail industries have been hit hard by social-distancing measures and mandated closures. The energy sector is suffering from low prices and many factories, including auto plants, were shut down.      Separate U.S. government reports on Wednesday showed steep declines in retail sales and industrial production.      Bitcoin investors are trying to grok what it all means for bitcoin.      ""Coronavirus now is the dominant narrative for crypto,"" says TheTIE's Frank.      If the stock market sells off again, possibly due to Wall Street reckoning that a V-shaped economic recovery isn't likely, will bitcoin follow?      ""If equities begin to decline due to fundamental factors (GDP/earnings declines, an elongated recovery, or simply 'Market is too expensive'), I don't expect BTC to follow,"" Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca Funds, wrote in an email. ""BTC is still an uncorrelated asset, and our fixation on positive correlations is recency bias.""      Nic Carter – a partner at Castle Island Ventures, which invests in blockchain-related companies – wrote Wednesday in a column for CoinDesk that government-funded bailouts could end up propping up companies whose business models could fundamentally change due to the coronavirus crisis. The airline industry, for example, may suffer from a decline in international travel.      ""Generally, I think it reinforces the justification for the existence of bitcoin and non-state monetary systems,"" Carter told CoinDesk in a message.      Michael Maloney, chief financial officer for bitcoin-mining firm Coinmint, said in an email he's still more focused on the halving: ""While I like the speculation surrounding digital gold as a response to Fed issuance, the halving is a mathematical proof that I can model out.""      Unchecked money printing by central banks might theoretically spur runaway inflation, but economic contractions tend to be deflationary: As demand for products and services tumble, prices tend to fall. According to the Los Angeles Times, airfares are down at least 29 percent, with nonstop, round-trip cross-country flights costing as little as $153.      ""The general direction of price inflation was down for both selling prices and non-labor input prices, as districts reported either slowing price growth, flat prices, or modest to moderate declines,"" according to the Fed's Beige Book. ""These trends were seen as reflecting weaker demand for many goods and services in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.""      None of the Fed's 12 regions reported upward wage pressures, due to widespread job cuts and salary cuts.      Put another way, the dollar's purchasing power – for goods, services, people's time – has increased, despite the Fed's balance sheet pushing above $6 trillion last week for the first time in its 107-year history.      ""The QE experiment isn't happening in a vacuum,"" Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, said Wednesday in a phone interview. ""It's happening in the context of the coronavirus shock.""      For bitcoin traders, it might be that context – instead of the halving – that increasingly matters the most.    Tweet of the day    Bitcoin watch    Trend: Bitcoin is flashing green on Thursday, amid signs of a risk reset in the traditional markets. The cryptocurrency is trading over $7,000 at press time, representing a 7 percent gain on the day.      Meanwhile, futures tied to the S&P 500 are up 0.8 percent and major European indices like Germany's DAX and France's CAC have so far added 1 percent and 0.30 percent to their value, respectively. The sentiment seems to have turned positive with European leaders taking tentative steps to ease coronavirus-led lockdowns and reopen their economies.      German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Wednesday that small shops along with larger car dealerships, bike shops and book shops will be allowed to reopen from Monday. Meanwhile, President Trump is set to announce on Thursday new guidelines for the reopening of the economy.      While bitcoin has bounced up strongly from Asian session lows, the cryptocurrency now needs to keep gains above the 50-day average at $7,000. The widely tracked technical line consistently capped upside last week.      If the bulls manage to establish a strong foothold above $7,000, more buyers may join the market ahead of the next month's halving, leading to a test of $8,000. On the downside, the low of $6,486 seen during the Asian trading hours is the level to beat for the bulls. But, with stocks reporting gains, the cryptocurrency looks set to build a new base above $7,000.

42431755,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN633h,1587033916,"Bitcoin Price Spikes Above $7.1K, Liquidating $23M on BitMEX","Bitcoin's price jumped close to $500 early on Thursday, triggering liquidations worth millions on crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX.      The top cryptocurrency by market value picked up a bid around $6,650 and rose to a high of $7,145 in the 90 minutes to 08:30 UTC, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.      The sudden move forced liquidations of futures worth $23 million on BiMEX, of which $10 million happened in the 60 minutes to 08:00 UTC and the remainder in the following 30 minutes, according to data provided by the crypto derivatives research firm Skew.      Total liquidation volume seen over that timeframe was significantly higher than the three-day hourly liquidation average of $1.6 million.      Sell liquidations occur when the market moves against long positions and breaches a predetermined limit, forcing BitMEX's liquidation engine to liquidate (or sell) long positions. Meanwhile, buy liquidations occur when prices move against short positions, forcing the liquidation engine to square off bearish bets.    Bets were bearish    While both long and short positions were liquidated, more than 93 percent of the total liquidations of $23 million were of short positions – a sign leverage was skewed to the downside.      Bitcoin had dropped to lows below $6,500 during the early Asian trading hours, having faced multiple rejections above $7,000 over the last few days. Further, Asian equity markets were also flashing red at the time, tracking overnight losses on Wall Street.      Hence, it's not surprising a majority of positions on BitMEX leaned to the bearish side.      It's worth noting that sudden and sizable price moves almost always lead to the forced unwinding of long or short positions, which in turn adds to the downward or upward pressure on prices.      See also: Does Crypto Need Circuit Breakers? Last Week’s Price Crash Ignites a Debate      For instance, as bitcoin fell below $6,000 during the early U.S. trading hours on March 12, BitMEX squared off nearly $700 million worth of long positions. That likely exaggerated the bearish move, sending prices on to lows below $5,000.    Tracking S&P 500 futures    Bitcoin continues to move roughly in tandem with futures tied to Wall Street's equity index, the S&P 500.      The cryptocurrency fell from $6,900 to $6,600 during Wednesday's U.S. trading hours, as the stock markets put in a negative performance on the back of a record drop in consumer spending, as represented by retail sales.      Sentiment remained weak early on Thursday, with Asian markets tracking Wall Street lower. However, the S&P 500 futures erased losses and rose by 0.8% after European stocks opened on a positive note.      Risk sentiment has reportedly stabilized due to world leaders taking steps to reopen economies hammered by the coronavirus outbreak.      Bitcoin followed suit by printing highs above $7,100 and taking the month-to-date gains to 9.6 percent. At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands near $7,040, representing a 6 percent gain on the day.    Hourly chart    Bitcoin's latest upward move is backed by strong volumes and looks to have legs. Notably, the $400 uptick to $7,000 (marked by arrow) was accompanied by the highest buying volume (green bars) since April 2, according to Bitstamp data.      The cryptocurrency, however, needs to print a strong hourly close above the top end of the descending channel. A breakout, if confirmed, would likely invite stronger chart-driven buying, leading to a re-test of recent highs near $7,500.      The outlook would again turn bearish if bitcoin finds acceptance under $6,695 – the low of today's high-volume bullish candle.

Value transfer refers to the U.S. dollar value of the total units on a blockchain that are transferred on a given day. With Bitcoin, the metric refers to the USD value of all the bitcoin sent on a given day.      Value transfer on Ethereum differs slightly. As well as its own ether cryptocurrency, Ethereum supports assets from third parties that can be sent and received over its network. For the above chart, value transfer on Ethereum refers to the USD value of both ETH and the Ethereum-based stablecoins that are transferred on on a given day.      Another chart from Messari show just how much the increase in the amount of value moved via USDT has boosted Ethereum's numbers over the last few months.    Data dispute    Citing concerns about the validity of Watkins' findings, independent developer Udi Wertheimer expressed his thoughts regarding the exclusion of Omni data, a software layer on the Bitcoin network that includes the issuance of the world's most used stablecoin, tether (USDT). The Ethereum chart had included data for USDT issued as an ERC-20 token.      ""USDT on Omni is bigger than all the non-USDT Ethereum-based stablecoins. If you include USDC and the smaller ones, you should also include Omni-USDT,"" Wertheimer said.      But Watkins was quick to answer, arguing the conclusion remained the same.      ""USDT transferred over Omni has dropped substantially as USDT has migrated over to Ethereum,"" Watkins told CoinDesk.      ""Furthermore, the amount of value transferred on Ethereum is slightly underestimated because it only includes the top stablecoins that CoinMetrics provides data for, and not all Ethereum-based tokens,"" he said.      According to its ""transparency"" page, Tether said it has up to almost $4.9 billion USDT on Ethereum, while it has up to $1.55 billion on Omni.    New record    In his tweet thread, Watkins also noted stablecoins have just had their best quarter to date. Issuance in the first quarter of this year, he said, had ""ballooned over $8 billion,"" adding almost as much to the category's market capitalization in Q1 as for all of 2019.      See also: G20 Watchdog Warns Nations to Mitigate Risks Posed by Libra-Like Stablecoins      ""Over the past two years, many stablecoin issuers have created stablecoins on Ethereum because of its flexible token standards that allow for the easy issuance and interoperability,"" according to Watkins.      ""These stablecoins have grown so great in amount that they're now being widely used as money on the Ethereum blockchain. Instead of sending and receiving value in ETH, which is volatile, users can send value in stablecoins which are price-stable with the U.S. dollar,"" the researcher said.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | USDT,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/04/16/ethereum-now-matches-bitcoin-on-one-key-metric,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/91eecc5bdf4080b79ce4f4bd83afe9ab341a8b93-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431728,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5u1h,1587024000,Mystery Hacker Tries to Steal Crypto Through Fake Google Chrome Wallet Extensions,"A hacker is exploiting trust in well-known brands by creating fake cryptocurrency wallet extensions for Google Chrome that trick victims into disclosing sensitive information.      Harry Denley, director of security at wallet provider MyCrypto, who identified the fake wallet extensions, said in a report Tuesday that Google has so far removed 49 extensions purporting to be well-known crypto wallets from its Chrome Web Store.      The fake extensions are basic phishing ploys. Posing as legitimate wallets, they leak personal information inputted by users, such as private keys and passwords, to the hacker, who can then drain balances in a matter of seconds.      The fakes detected have so far claimed to be wallets including Ledger, Trezor, Jaxx, Electrum, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Exodus and KeepKey. Test amounts of crypto sent by Denley have not been picked up, suggesting that either the hacker has to manually empty wallets or they are only interested in comparatively large balances.      See also: Hacker Exploits Flaw in Decentralized Bitcoin Exchange Bisq to Steal $250K      On the Chrome Web Store most of these apps had consistently good reviews written typically in simplistic or broken English. On the basis that the admin email appears to be a Russian one, it's possible the hacker could also be based there, Denley noted.      More than half of all malicious extensions reported have claimed to be hardware wallet maker Ledger – nearly double the next largest, MyEtherWallet, which was 22 percent of fake extensions. There's no obvious reason why the hacker decided to focus so much on Ledger, Denley said in his report.      When asked if there's a way to prevent hackers from creating new fake extensions, Denley told CoinDesk: ""Not really, though Google could use the data from the 49 extensions we've flagged to build some detection – though it could be easily bypassed.""      See also: There’s a New Way to Get Your Stolen Crypto Back      ""Most of the malicious extensions had the same structure and same files which could be analysed,"" he said. ""The only way I can think of limiting the victim pool is by education and normalising the behaviour of not entering raw secrets into [user interfaces].""      Denley has highlighted serious security threats in cryptocurrency wallets before. Last year, he wrote a paper showing how one supposedly secure wallet provider was in fact issuing the same private keys to multiple users.      Denley first detected the fake wallets in February. Since then, the number of reported phishing attacks has risen exponentially on a month-on-month basis. Because the hacker has not yet been identified, it's possible they could continue creating fake wallet extensions ad infinitum.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | WALLET,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/16/mystery-hacker-tries-to-steal-crypto-through-fake-google-chrome-wallet-extensions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76e7df2b30917a2d8e86a34dac4696179cfbf401-1900x1268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431724,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN5tth,1587009600,Swiss Crypto Firm Closes $14.5M Series B to Help Secure Brokerage License,"Swiss holding company Crypto Finance AG has closed a $14.5 million Series B funding round co-led by Swiss investor Rainer-Marc Frey, Beijing-based private equity firm Lingfeng Capital and joined by Hong Kong’s QBN Capital.      The round began in September 2019 and was initially slated to close two weeks prior to Thursday, but was delayed by the financial uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, Crypto Finance AG CEO and founder Jan Brzezek told CoinDesk in a phone interview.      Crypto Finance AG operates three subsidiaries including Crypto Fund AG, Crypto Broker AG and Crypto Storage AG. Brzezek said the Series B funds will be used to fulfill capital requirements for obtaining a broker-dealer license from the Swiss financial regulator FINMA for Crypto Broker AG. Sister-firm Crypto Fund AG received its FINMA license in October 2018.      Brzezek said the subsidiary is in the “final mile” of receiving the license, which will allow the firm to expand its cryptocurrency trading business to additional banks in Switzerland and abroad. Specifically, the license will let Crypto Broker AG increase its trading values and expand into derivative products. Brzezek said the process has taken 18 months so far.      More-traditional financial institutions, Brzezek said, “don't want the hassle of connecting [with] different exchanges and brokers. … But they connect their API or order management systems to our infrastructure and then they can trade around the world.”      He said the firm is not a prime broker like Genesis Capital or Cumberland but offers “best execution,” a valued feature for traditional players looking for small price spreads on market orders.    Asian capital    Crypto Finance AG is also looking East following the raise, which brings the total since its founding in 2017 to $37.29 million. The Swiss company has attracted attention from Asian investors who remain bullish on crypto but would rather invest in regulatory-friendly markets, Brzezek said.      “The U.S. is still struggling to find the common solution,” Brzezek said of regulatory hurdles in the states. “We have a very good legal basis to operate in Europe and in Asia.”      In a statement, Lingfeng Capital partner Ming Shu said his firm looks forward to “building a bridge between Europe and Asia with Crypto Finance.” Consulting firm PwC was enlisted for investor introductions, according to a press release. As part of the funding round, Brzezek has proposed that Shu join the Crypto Finance AG board of directors.      The Swiss firm is also planning to enter the crypto derivatives market, with Brzezek citing the allure of high trading volumes on incumbent platforms such as BitMEX. Brzezek said Crypto Broker AG plans to offer derivative products to clients and is seeking licensing.      Although a timetable was not given for launching a regulated derivatives platform, Brzezek said he saw “a lot of interest in the room.”",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/04/16/swiss-crypto-firm-closes-145m-series-b-to-help-secure-brokerage-license,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/58d95a76a5cd2511493692c8bcd31a489f2d9156-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
