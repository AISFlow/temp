11935900,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527642,1681945245,"Uniswap Depreciates, Vital Levels To Keep An Eye On","The past few days saw a recovery in the Uniswap price, but it appears that the bullish trend has reached exhaustion. UNI dropped by 6% in the past 24 hours, causing its price to fall below its descending line. Although Uniswap gained 0.7% on the weekly chart, most of its gains were wiped out due to the recent drop in price. Currently, the technical outlook for Uniswap indicates that the bears are gaining strength, with demand for the altcoin dipping as buyers lose confidence and accumulation decreases. Related Reading: Coinbase Turns To Europe For Growth Amid Clampdown By US Regulators For buyers to re-enter the market, UNI must surpass its immediate resistance mark, and buyer strength must make a comeback. However, if Bitcoin fails to remain above the $30,000 mark, it is likely that other altcoins like UNI will also experience a dip. Even if BTC surges again, UNI’s recovery may not be sustainable in the long run. In addition, UNI’s trading volume has declined, suggesting an increase in short-term selling on the one-day chart. Uniswap Price Analysis: One-Day Chart At the time of writing, UNI was priced at $5.95 with a key resistance level of $6. Breaking through this resistance could potentially push UNI to reach $6.30, thereby reversing the bearish thesis. Conversely, if UNI loses its current price level, it may find support at $5.70. However, if it falls below this level, it could drop to $5.30. The recent trading session saw an increase in the number of sellers, which was reflected by the red volume bars on the chart. Technical Analysis Buyers are leaving the market owing to decreased demand. This has caused Relative Strength Index (RSI) to dip below the half-line, indicating that sellers currently outnumber buyers. A further drop in price could lead to a complete return of bearish sentiment as the price falls into a supply zone. Additionally, UNI’s price has fallen below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, indicating that sellers are currently driving the price momentum in the market. However, if buyers were to step in, UNI could potentially rise above the 20-SMA line. The bears have taken over, as evidenced by other technical indicators. Despite this, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator displayed green histograms. These are associated with buy signals. Related Reading: These Top 5 Cryptos Are Thriving Despite A Slippery Market However, the buy signal’s strength has decreased. It indicated mounting bearish pressure. Meanwhile, the Bollinger Bands, which measure price volatility and fluctuation, have tightened, suggesting that UNI could experience range-bound movement in the upcoming trading sessions. Moving forward the broader market strength will be crucial for the price of the altcoin.

11935899,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527676,1681945211,"Bitcoin Shrimp Supply Continues To Rise, Why This Is Good","On-chain data shows the Bitcoin shrimp supply has continued to rise recently, which can be positive for the BTC ecosystem. Bitcoin Shrimps Now Hold 6.7% Of The Entire Circulating Supply According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the BTC shrimps have added 1.78% of the cryptocurrency’s supply to their holdings since the LUNA crash last year. The relevant indicator here is the “Entities Supply Distribution,” which measures the total percentage of the Bitcoin supply that each entity group in the market is currently holding. Investors are divided into these entities based on the total number of coins they carry in their wallets. For example, the 0.001 to 0.01 group includes all addresses holding at least 0.001 and 0.01 BTC. When the Entities Supply Distribution metric is applied to this specific group, it tells us about the percentage of the BTC supply that the amounts of wallets falling in this range add up to. The “shrimps” are holders with less than 1 BTC in their wallet balances. This means that this cohort includes all entity groups in the 0 to 1 range (to be more precise, four groups satisfying this condition: less than 0.001, 0.001 to 0.01, 0.01 to 0.1, and 0.1 to1). Related Reading: Sell Bitcoin For $45,000 In May And Go Away If History Is Guide Here is a chart that shows the Entities Supply Distribution for the entities belonging specifically to the shrimps’ cohort: The values of these metrics seem to have been rising in recent days | Source: Glassnode on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the percentage of the total Bitcoin circulating supply held by the shrimps has notably increased during the past year or so. As a whole, these investors now hold 6.7% of the entire BTC supply. The shrimps represent the retail investor segment of the BTC market, so their supply rising up during this period implies that retail participation has been increasing in the sector. Related Reading: Bitcoin Korea Premium Index Shows Signs Of Selling, Pullback Soon? The percentage of the supply held by these smallholders had already increased during the preceding couple of years, but the growth had been slower. In the past year, a few events have resulted in the growth of this cohort to accelerate. The chart shows that the first of these was the LUNA collapse back in May 2022, while the second one was the 3AC bankruptcy, which took place only a few weeks later. The most significant effect appears to have been from the FTX crash back in November, as the supply held by these holders rapidly rose shortly after it occurred. Accumulation from retail investors can be constructive for the Bitcoin market in the long term as it represents growth in the adoption of the cryptocurrency. Adoption generally provides a solid foundation for the sector, on which later price moves can sustainably lift off from.

CoinJoin is a way of combining multiple bitcoin transactions to enhance privacy.  Trezor says the Model T is the first and only hardware wallet to enable CoinJoin transactions for bitcoin. Several software or “hot” wallets like zkSNACKs’ Wasabi wallet already have CoinJoin. The feature will be rolled out to Trezor’s Model One devices at a future date, according to the company.  Most transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are publicly available. A basic tool such as a block explorer – a piece of software for analyzing cryptocurrency transactions – is all it takes to tie those transactions to real life identities and violate users’ financial privacy.  CoinJoin attempts to reinstate privacy by combining multiple bitcoin payments from multiple spenders to produce a single transaction whose history and ownership are obfuscated.  CoinJoin can be done through decentralized coinjoin marketplaces such as JoinMarket, or through wallets like Trezor’s Model T or zkSNACKs’ Wasabi wallet. Both Model T and Wasabi use zkSNACKs’ CoinJoin service that charges a coordination fee – 0.3% of the coinjoined amount according to Trezor.  Per Trezor’s release: “Users simply click on the ‘anonymize’ button. Users then choose the number of CoinJoin rounds — with every round increasing the level of privacy — confirm their choices on the Trezor device, and the rest of the coinjoin process is automated and requires no active user participation.”  Trezor’s other privacy features include Tor, coin control, and Shamir backup.  “Trezor values privacy as an individual’s most important asset,” said Matěj Žák, CEO of Trezor. “Consequently, we’re delighted that we’ve found a way for our community to keep their bitcoin history private.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/19/trezor-model-t-gets-bitcoin-privacy-upgrade-with-new-coinjoin-feature,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba99eff639fa825a9265e4587dd2d17181ecc644-5296x3300.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11934493,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527577,1681941626,"Bitcoin Bears Steal 3%, Time To DCA?","Applying a Dollar Cost Average (DCA) method can be smart for investors looking to profit from the crypto markets. Yesterday’s trade session witnessed a brilliant price recovery from Bitcoin after it reclaimed the $30,000 level, pushing some Altcoins to the upside. While the bulls basked in the glory of their supposed win and retaliation, BTC Bears decided to drop the ball again in today’s trade session with a slightly over 3% drop. Several Altcoins, including Ethereum, have recorded losses as BTC struggles in price, trading slightly above the $29,000 price region. While market sentiments may fluctuate, employing a dollar-cost average strategy can be the close-to-perfect strategy to profit from these BTC rallies. Related Reading: ICP Bulls On A 10-Day Joy Ride, When Does It Stop? Applying A DCA Strategy To Bitcoin Bitcoin started 2023 on a good note as it has produced four consecutive monthly green candles and a rally that broke past $30,000 for the first time since June 2022. However, a Forbes report called for a $10,000 Bitcoin price prediction in the first quarter of 2023. Crypto investors who took the call and waited missed out on Bitcoin’s rally or had to buy at higher entry points. This is why DCA strategies are necessary not to miss out on future price bottoms and asset rallies. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) is an investment strategy smart investors use to buy into an asset using a fixed amount of capital at different time intervals. Regardless of market ups and downs movements, this strategy is utilized and employed by investors to profit from potential price bottoms and rallies in the future. As a case study, Bitcoin is a popular digital asset and cryptocurrency known for its high price volatility and movements in the crypto and financial markets. Right from its creation as a cryptocurrency, it has experienced multiple bear and bull cycles which commonly sees it trading at high peaks (bull markets) and lows (bear market). Every trader wishes to accurately time these bottoms and peaks and take profitable trade actions, but this is almost impossible, as it were unless a DCA strategy is applied. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Binance Whale Games And More Crypto Investors Are Still Greedy Bitcoin’s fear and greed index still shows that while a retracement is seen in the price of Bitcoin today, investors are still greedy. A report shows that the current greed level for BTC at $29,274 is at 63, which is a relatively high amount of greed among crypto investors. This indicates that investors are still buying BTC at the current price for which it is trading. On the flip side, a general rule of thumb is that extreme greed could indicate a possible price retracement, while extreme fear presents buy opportunities in the markets. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is seen trading at $29,163.

CAKE Slides 25% From February Highs CAKE is the utility token of PancakeSwap, a decentralized exchange running on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Like the rest of the cryptocurrency market, CAKE is under immense pressure, dropping four percent on the last trading day. Related Reading: CAKE Remains Under Pressure Despite PancakeSwap Dominating BSC Notably, CAKE is also down 25% from early February. The token price is at March 2023 lows and looks likely to break the support line at around $3.45. The bearish engulfing bar of April 19 is wide-ranging and with decent volumes. It is a continuation of losses of March 27 and a confirmation of sellers set in motion on February 9. On this day, the Uniswap community voted to deploy Uniswap v3 on BNB Chain, a smart contracting platform similar to Ethereum. It also marked the first time Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, had been deployed to a high-activity platform like the BNB Chain. The contraction of CAKE prices was in response to the expected competition considering Uniswap’s dominance in Ethereum and decentralized finance (DeFi), judging from the protocol’s total value locked (TVL). As an illustration, DeFiLlama data on April 19 shows that Uniswap had a TVL of $4.29 billion, more than $2 billion that of PancakeSwap. Despite initial fears, PancakeSwap remains the dominant DEX on the BNB Chain ecosystem, enabling the trading of BEP-20 tokens. PancakeSwap’s Tokenomics Proposal CAKE’s dump continues even after a proposal from the PancakeSwap community to make CAKE more deflationary. In the new proposal, CAKE would have an annual inflation rate of 3% and 5%, prioritizing shifting to a more sustainable staking model. Here, the goal is to have low staking inflation of CAKE, wherein the real yield is from PancakeSwap’s revenue. At the same time, the goal is to create a structure that favors long-term CAKE staking. Related Reading: PancakeSwap TVL Drops 12%, Did This Exchange Received A Lethal Blow? Breaking down details, staking allocation per block will drop from 6.65 CAKE per block to a target of about 0.35 – 1 CAKE per block.

Clients including wholesale food vendors, law firms and trust accounts rushed to pull out deposits from the bank last month, New York State Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris told the House Financial Services Committee . ""It is a misnomer that the failure of Signature ( OTC:SBNY ) was related to crypto,"" she said. ""The outflow of crypto deposits was in exact proportion to the representation in the depositor base overall."" In the bank run following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, ~20% of the deposits left Signature ( OTC:SBNY ). Of these, 20% were by crypto clients, Bloomberg quoted Harris as saying. Signature ( OTC:SBNY ) was taken over by the FDIC soon after. Harris highlighted that Signature ( OTC:SBNY ) was already limiting its crypto deposit exposure prior to the bank run. Many in the crypto industry believe a concerted effort by U.S. authorities led to the closing of Signature ( OTC:SBNY ).

The facility offers investors the one-month T-bill yield less the 0.5% management fee on stablecoin deposits, the protocol said. Currently, the one-month T-bill rate is at around 3.7%, meaning that the investment would offer a 3.2% annual yield.  Maple’s new offering comes as crypto investors have become increasingly keen to earn yields by investing in traditional financial (TradFi) assets. Stablecoins generally do not offer users yield, while crypto lending may come with outsized risks, as last year’s defaults and insolvencies among digital asset firms proved.  Meanwhile, yields in traditional markets have risen after central banks globally hiked interest rates to combat inflation. Multiple blockchain protocols have started to offer tokenized versions of real-world assets (RWA) such as government bonds, making RWAs one of the hottest trends in crypto this year.  The pool is structured as a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that collects investor’s stablecoins and lends it to crypto hedge fund Room40 Capital, the sole borrower of the pool, to invest in T-bills, the post explained.  The pool allows accredited investors, crypto firms and decentralized autonomous organizations’ (DAO) treasuries to earn yield on their idle stablecoins with low risk, as short-term U.S. Treasurys are considered among the safest investments.  Maple and Room40 does not require any lockup period for deposits before withdrawal, making the pool ideal for managing cash held in stablecoins, the protocol said.  Notably, only entities and individuals based outside of the U.S. can access the pool after completing a three-step know-your-customer (KYC) check.

DOGE closed 2022 at the price of $0.07029 due to the market-wide crash following the FTX incident. Since the start of 2023, the token has remained between the $0.07 and $0.09 price ranges, indicating minimal action within this period. While its 24-hour price is currently down by 5.66%, there’s no guarantee that it will continue declining or reverse to an uptrend. But some technical indicators may tell whether Dogecoin will resume the uptrend or fall even further. Dogecoin Hit Resistance Level At $0.09268 Dogecoin maintained seven green bars, indicating a bullish trend over the last seven days. This price movement brought the token above a resistance level at $0.09268 yesterday after reaching the day’s high of $0.09449. It eventually closed the day at $0.09399 and continued a downtrend since the beginning of today. On April 19th, Dogecoin entered around the $0.094 price mark. At the time of writing, the token has declined by 5.62% from this figure, as it currently trades at $0.08787. It has already dropped to the day’s low at $0.08417, indicating a buy move at the current price. Related Reading: Binance Coin (BNB) Rallies 8% Ahead Of Hard Fork Upgrade Notably, the Dogecoin price could resume an uptrend considering the recent boost in its trading volume over the past day. The meme coin saw about $1.5 billion in trading volume yesterday. Meanwhile, the trading volume in the last 24 hours is a little over $1 billion, indicating around a 24.51% surge within the same period. The token could significantly recover with such trading activities on the network. What’s Next For DOGE – Will It Plunge Or Soar? As the daily chart indicates, Dogecoin is on a downtrend, creating a long red bar. This is the first red candle it’s posting after seven days of bullish price actions. But based on the current market sentiment, the coin will likely make an uptrend shortly. Dogecoin trades above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs), indicating bullish sentiments for the token’s price. Also, the Relative Strength Index indicator is gradually approaching buy sentiments from its current neutral state at 54.58. Based on the 1-day chart, some major resistance levels are $0.09268 and $0.10350. On the other hand, notable support levels are $0.07007 and $0.06259. The indicators above show a higher tendency for the token to resume an uptrend than to continue a bearish move. However, crypto assets are volatile and could deviate from predicted prices without warning. So, invest with caution by employing risk management techniques.

The largest cryptocurrency by market cap recently fell below $30,000 a day after regaining its perch above this psychologically important threshold and dipped as low as $29,045 at one point, according to CoinDesk data.  The decline also caught traders who were betting on an increase off guard because the majority of BTC liquidated positions were long, according to data from futures and trading platform Coinglass.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar pattern, dropping below $2,000 on Wednesday for the first time in almost a week. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently changing hands around $1,981, down over 4% from Tuesday, same time.  Most major cryptos were in the red on Wednesday, including a number of decentralized finance tokens. DeFi exchange Uniswap’s UNI and lending platform Aave’s AAVE sank 6% and 7%, respectively, to trade at around $5.90 and $74.85. Maker’s MKR tanked by 5% to hover at around $729.31.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures overall crypto market performance, was down 3% for the day.  Decentralized exchanges (DEX) volumes had been surging amid growing concerns about their centralized counterparts, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of digital asset information platform The Tie, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  “I think it’s likely that we see this trend continue until we get clarity on the Binance regulatory situation,” Frank wrote, although he added that DeFi accounts for less than 5% of the overall crypto market cap.  Meanwhile, increasing regulatory scrutiny continued with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reopening a proposal from last year that would target DeFi exchanges for regulation.  “Regulatory crackdowns against DeFi, concerns around security with DeFi hacks occurring regularly, and nervousness around who the counterparties actually are on DeFi platforms are likely going to continue to delay real institutional adoption,” Frank said.

But the coffee company’s Web3 loyalty program did what beta programs are supposed to do and let the company learn from its mistakes.  Starbucks’ loyalty program released “The Siren Collection,” its first limited-edition NFTs on March 9 to members of the invitation-only beta. Despite the limited number of people in the program, the drop of 2,000 Stamps priced at $100 was met with such high demand it crashed parts of the Starbucks Odyssey website. Many members complained of error messages and other issues preventing them from buying one of the NFTs on Nifty Gateway.  “The Starbucks First Store Collection,” the second NFT drop, is an edition of 5,000 Stamps priced at $99. The program limited the initial sale to Odyssey members who had earned at least two unique Journeys Stamps and had them in their wallet at the time of the pre-sale. In addition, they restricted the sale to one per customer, down from the two per customer maximum of the original sale.  While the token-gated pre-sale was a good start to stemming the problems of last time, there were still members confused to find out they weren’t eligible, and in the first few minutes of the early-access period the Discord group was flooded with screenshots of people getting stuck on the second stage of the process and anxiously awaiting delivery. Reports of wait times in the Discord chat varied from 5 minutes to upwards of 15 minutes.  After the 3-hour pre-sale concluded, the rest of the Odyssey members were able to snag one of the roughly 2,800 stamps remaining. The general sale that followed also seemed to go smoother, with NFTs still available for purchase as of publication time.  Those who bought a “First Store” Stamp will see the art revealed on April 20. According to Starbucks, the art will focus on “commemorating 1912 Pike Place. Depicted as a multi-media collage of photos, in-store textures and prominent icons from our archives, this collection puts a modern spin on the historic landmark.” 1912 Pike Place is the location of the first Starbucks store in Seattle.  As of writing, secondary sales of The Siren Collection NFTs are hovering at a $460 floor price on Nifty Gateway and have done over half a million dollars in trading volume.  The Odyssey Program also recently revealed reward tiers for the points members have been collecting for completing Journeys and buying stamps.  Level 1 will require 1,000-2,999 points and reward choices are a virtual coffee class, a Starbucks coffee passport or to make a charitable donation to Feeding America. For 3,000-5,999 points, members reach Level 2 and can name a coffee tree, attend a virtual tasting paired with a bag of coffee or receive a Starbucks cold cup. Level 3 is for members with 6,000 points or more and rewards to choose from are a customized MiiR 360 traveler, 30 days of free drinks or an experience at a Starbucks Reserve store.

42394071,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVknN,1681933458,Blockchain Meets Bonds: How Crypto Can Solve Long-Standing Issues in Capital Markets,"In the 1988 movie ""Die Hard,"" a New York City police officer travels to Los Angeles to reunite with his estranged wife at her company’s holiday party. As the party is underway, terrorists seize control of the building and take everyone hostage. The intruders were on a mission to steal $640 million in bearer bonds, which, unlike registered bonds, carried no serial number or registration records and are untraceable with no record of ownership. If they had been successful, the law would have presumed the person in possession of the bond (the bearer) was the rightful owner.  Anthony Bufinsky is the head of growth at Arca Labs.  But with the advent of blockchain, a ""Die Hard"" heist would be fruitless. Smart bonds – digital bonds stored on a distributed ledger – are an emerging application of the technology wherein each bond has a unique digital signature that verifies ownership and eliminates the need for physical certificates. Blockchain ensures all transactions are recorded and stored permanently, making it difficult for anyone to steal or alter the bond's value without detection.  Smart bonds can transform the life cycle of debt instruments and have the potential to disrupt debt capital markets. This digitalization of bonds may enhance process efficiencies and liquidity, reduce costs, simplify and democratize capital raising for issuers, and create a broader investable landscape. For over three centuries, bonds were issued as paper certificates. However, as the volume of trading grew, companies became inundated with paperwork. In 1973, the Depository Trust Company (DTC) was created to address the mounting paperwork and security issues. Paper certificates were vulnerable to loss, tax evasion, money laundering and theft such as a real-life bearer bond heist. During the London City bonds robbery of 1990, thieves stole 291.9 million British pounds (equivalent to 848.8 million pounds today), highlighting the risks associated with physical bearer bonds. As a result, the use of physical bearer bonds declined in favor of electronic records. Then in 1995, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) released paperless rules, ending the era of paper securities and introducing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC), a central depository for the custody of all securities. This change ushered in faster middle and back office processes and greater protections in the securities market.  The digitalization of financial instruments is leading to significant innovations in capital markets operations.  While paper certificates carried a five-day settlement time, this new system required at least two days in the settlement of bond transactions. Although electronic processes increased efficiencies and reduced human error, extended settlement timelines exacerbated the liquidity disaster faced by banks during the 2008 financial crisis. After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, the payments to counterparties that had traded with them were delayed. Recently, the SEC proposed a reduction of settlement time to one day, but this is a temporary bandage. Capital market participants want accurate and complete information and expedited settlement; blockchain technology can make it possible, and the emergence of smart bonds is a step in this direction.  Digitalization: Disrupting debt capital markets  The key function of smart bonds is the digitalization of debt instrument covenants into smart contracts. Smart bonds are self-executing bond contracts that use blockchain technology to automate the various stages of a bond’s life cycle and execute specific actions based on predetermined conditions without manual intervention. This straight-through processing (STP) is built into the DNA of smart bonds. It optimizes debt securities issuance, trading, clearing, settlement and interest payments, reducing the time and resources required to execute transactions. Smart bonds can also significantly reduce the need for intermediaries, such as banks, brokers, and clearinghouses. By eliminating intermediaries, the fees associated with their services are also eliminated. This reduces the overall cost of managing bonds.  Issuance and trading: After a bond’s issue price is established, the agreed-upon details (such as issuer, maturity date, coupon rate, issue price and face value) can be coded into a smart contract and stored on a blockchain. This ensures authenticity, provenance and transparency. ​​The lead manager or underwriter allocates smart bond tokens to investors. Payment is automatically deducted from investors’ accounts, immediately and simultaneously settling the transaction for all investors across all time zones. Blockchain enables a tokenization platform – a decentralized and secure trading environment that connects issuers with investors and allows transactions without intermediaries like brokers or dealers. Smart contracts automate the transfer of ownership and update the bondholder registry, ensuring accuracy and reducing the risk of errors.  Clearing and settlement: Traditionally, bonds are settled during banking hours. Additionally, the settlement period can take up to five days in primary markets and two days in secondary. This latency period exposes market participants to potential price swings. Conversely, smart contracts can automatically trigger clearing and settlement processes as long as both parties have agreed to the contract terms and the necessary conditions have been met. This instant settlement reduces the time required to complete these tasks and the likelihood of a price change between the time of trade and settlement. While smart bond settlement is not limited by banking hours, it may still be subject to certain trading platform or exchange rules.  Interest payments and maturity: Smart contracts can automate interest payments by releasing funds to bondholders on specified payment dates. Eliminating the need for a central counterparty reduces counterparty risk; at the bond's maturity, the principal amount can also be automatically returned to the bondholder, ensuring timely payments and reducing the risk of default.  Due to high-profile attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, there is a perceived risk that smart bonds may be vulnerable to hacks and other security breaches. However, unlike cryptocurrencies, smart bonds are not bearer assets. Instead, ownership of smart bonds is automatically registered on the blockchain. Therefore, fraudulent transfers of smart bonds can be invalidated. Depending on the regulatory requirements, ownership of smart bonds may be recorded with transfer agents, too. Transfer agents help safeguard customer assets by facilitating the freezing, cancellation or replacement of tokens in the unlikely event of a mistake or malicious attack. However, this decreases the component of decentralization.

Still, all the possible benefits of smart bonds cannot be leveraged because regulations are based on authorized parties' electronic entries in private ledgers. While legal challenges could hinder smart bond adoption in the short term, as the infrastructure evolves and more organizations and municipalities adopt the technology established, we expect to see greater innovation and growth.

Bitkey, C=, TBD, and MDK may be unheard of to investors but should be considered as long-term growth drivers. When investing in Block Inc, investors need to be aligned with the Bitcoin route the company is taking for long-term growth. These initiatives are quickly increasing the company's TAM. Investment Thesis Long-term investors in Block Inc. ( SQ ) need to take a stance on the company's emerging business units. Bitkey, C=, & MDK are Bitcoin-related ( BTC-USD ) companies, while TBD is a platform that is building the foundation for decentralized identity. What makes Block Inc. unique is its ability to innovate from within the company. It has done this already with its platform Cash App, which has now surpassed the original square business in quarterly gross profit. Investors should be cautious given that Bitcoin is in the early stages of potentially being regulated. But, in all, I believe that emerging businesses will be able to create substantial shareholder value in the long run by increasing addressable markets while reinforcing the company's closed-loop ecosystem strategy. Cash App: From Start-up to Growth As you may know, Block Inc's first core product was the Square POS system. But, in 2013 the company launched a project to build out a small internal start-up: Cash App. Cash App began as a simple P2P platform, but has since grown its product offerings significantly. In 2016, Cash App retained $5 in gross profit per customer and reached $47 per customer as of their 2022 investor day by launching products such as instant deposit, cash app card, direct deposit, Bitcoin trading, etc. These new products, network effects, as well as successful marketing campaigns, have driven incredible user growth over the six years shown below. In 2015, Cash App only had 1 million monthly transacting actives (note the importance of the terminology used ) - which I consider a start-up or perhaps a high-growth firm. Transacting Actives (Block Inc. Investor Presentation) Flash forward to 2022 Q4, Cash App's gross profit exceeded Square's gross profit for the first time in the company's history. In other words, the Cash App business is now an established company on a stand-alone basis. Q4 Results (Block Inc. Investor Relations) The New Start-Ups Block Inc. has four start-ups within its ecosystem, all with varying degrees of maturity. Over the long term, I expect a couple of these start-ups to follow the same trajectory as Cash App has done. I'm going to present them below in order of most mature to least mature. The benefit that Block Inc. has now, compared to earlier, is a larger amount of capital to deploy on developing ecosystems. As of Block Inc's investor day, they announced that the company was only spending Investment Criteria (Block Inc. Investor Day ) TBD TBD, Block Inc's most mature start-up, is led by Mike Brock. He has been active in the Cash App business and he was responsible for creating Spiral , which is an ecosystem responsible for supporting Bitcoin developers. I have not included Spiral in this analysis since it is non-profit. TBD is working on technology that enables users to have a decentralized identity on the web. TBD's mission is to build Web5: ""Web5 is the banner for a set of new technologies that upgrade the Web with decentralized identity, P2P trust mechanisms, and a decentralized app layer. The term Web5 is a throwback that pays homage to HTML5, which was used to represent the last major effort to evolve the Web some 15 years ago."" As of now, TBD project roadmap is currently 64% complete, and since they stand for open-source communication, investors and other stakeholders can follow their progress through the following link: https://areweweb5yet.com/ TBD Product Development (areweweb5yet.com) Decentralized Identifiers will allow web users to have one account or one unique identity for many different platforms. This implies that each individual will store and own their own data and simply move it from platform to platform. For example, imagine a world where you can easily switch from one music streaming platform to another by moving all of your playlists with the click of a button. Or imagine a world where you can move between different social media platforms and bring your friends along with you. These types of abilities are what TBD is enabling through its full stack of products shown above. TBD is aiming to be 80% complete within the next month! According to Emergen Research , the decentralized identity market size was $725 million in 2022 and they expect the market to grow at an astonishing 87.3% CAGR through 2032. The main growth driver for this blockchain-based technology is identity theft and security breaches. ""With a decentralized identification paradigm, Personally Identifiable Information ((PPI)) is never duplicated or kept. Instead, a trusted source confirms the needed information without disclosing any personally identifiable information."" Key Trends (Emergen Research ) The research report claims Microsoft ( MSFT ), Accenture, Nuggets, 1Kosmos Inc., among other firms to be major players in this industry so far. I believe that the research report overlooked Block Inc. due to the fact that TBD has not yet commercialized a product. But, since the market is still young and fairly fragmented I expect TBD to gain market share within the consumer segment of the market once they have a product ready. Block Inc has experience working with business customers through its Square product as well as with consumers through its Cash App product and their industry knowledge will serve as a building block for growing TBD going forward. Grand View Research expects this market to be worth $102 billion in 2030, Allied Market Research is expecting $77.8 billion by 2031, and MarketsAndMarkets is expecting $6.8 billion by 2027. This goes to show that it is difficult to estimate the growth in this market, so investors should take these projections with a grain of salt. But, the consensus is nonetheless that this industry will be growing incredibly fast over the next decade. Bitkey Bitkey is led by Jesse Dorogusker, who is also the CEO of Block's subsidiary Tidal. Jesse was previously the Director of Engineering at Apple for key products such as the iPhone, iPad, and iPod accessories. Bitkey is a hardware wallet product that allows users to store Bitcoin in a secure and non-custodial way (a.k.a a cold wallet). Furthermore, the hardware wallet itself is going to be coupled with an app where you can manage your finances as well as send cross-border payments using Bitcoin. Block is striving to make Bitkey as secure and easy to use as possible, which is why the company is also building a service in which you can recover your unique key if you happen to lose it. This is incredibly important to include in a hardware product - that is notoriously difficult to use - because it will drive fast user adoption among consumers who are not tech-savvy. Bitkey has now been sent out to 200 Block employees with varying technical knowledge, 19 different nationalities, and different phone operating systems (about 50/50 IOS & Android). This is how the product looks in use: Bitkey Product (Jack Dorsey Damus ) Jack Dorsey has been claiming on Damus that Bitkey ""Feels really amazing. Especially the recovery methods."" Business Wire predicts the hardware wallet market size will grow from $442.56 million in 2021 to reach $3.6 billion by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 23.7% from 2022 to 2031. IMARC Group expects the market to reach US $1.23 Million by 2028 and Valuates is expecting a market size of $1.67 billion by 2029. In other words, researchers have a stronger consensus of the growth in this industry. The Digital Trend mentions in its article Block: Reshaping The Future that the banking crisis during the past month may lead consumers to be less trustful toward the established banking system, similar to what happened after 2008. This leads me to believe that market growth for cold wallets could be underestimated, though it is difficult to put a figure on it. Once again, research reports overlook Block Inc as a player in this emerging market. Current market participants that the researchers find are, among others, Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey, and CoolWallet. From my intuition, market participants will be competing on ease of use, security, and price. As a large company, Block Inc. has a clear cost advantage in which it could sell the hardware at a loss and rely on recurring revenue streams for subscription services (similar to their Square revenue model ). As shown in the picture above, Bitkey can be unlocked with the consumer's unique fingerprint which exemplifies the company's focus on both ease of use and security. As for now, though, I believe it is too early to rate the performance of the product. In order to keep up-to-date with the newest developments, check out this link: https://bitkey.build/ C= C= is a Bitcoin-related startup that serves to increase the strength of Bitcoin as a payment method. C= is a lightning node provider , which means that it provides Bitcoin liquidity for those who want to send Bitcoin or Bitcoin sending over the lightning network. They make use of Block Inc's $133 million of Bitcoin (as of Q4 Shareholder Letter) in order to enable institutional customers as well as individuals to send Bitcoin quickly. In an interview C= lead, Nick Slaney, states ""Right now we have about 8,000 Bitcoin...We're putting our Bitcoin to use and we're actually hoping to generate some revenue off it"" C= currently has 1.3 trillion sats (satoshi) invested into its lightning node, which is equivalent to 13 Bitcoin or ~$387,000 . So, this amount makes up a very small portion of Block Inc.'s Bitcoin holding. C= Lightning Stats (Amboss) Nonetheless, C='s lightning node is already ranked the 123rd largest based on capacity (Amboss) , which is impressive considering the short amount of time it has been in operation. C= can generate profit from this lightning node by either forwarding payments or selling liquidity . Although the quick growth is exciting, the revenues generated from this node will most likely not be material to Block Inc in the foreseeable future. MDK The Mining Development Kit, similar to what it sounds like, is a project that is working on building its own Bitcoin mining semiconductor chips to serve as the foundation for a full suite of Bitcoin mining products. The philosophy behind this project is to decentralize Bitcoin mining by making it accessible and easy for anybody to use. MDK is still in its nascent stages, but it is worth mentioning due to the projected market size of Bitcoin mining hardware. Allied Market Research expects the Bitcoin mining hardware market to reach a total worth of $1.7 billion by 2031. The market growth for Bitcoin mining will most likely follow the cyclical nature of Bitcoin Mining revenues, which are shown below. Bitcoin Mining (Bitcoin Magazine) Risk The company sees value in Bitcoin not only due to its incredibly fast adoption but also its continued growth potential. Along with the quick adoption that Bitcoin has already experienced, a larger lack of trust in the established banking/payment system is another tailwind for the technology. Bitcoin Asset Class (Block Inc Investor Day 2022) These start-ups, though, do come with inherent risks with Bitcoin as a system for which to build the ecosystems on top of. Seeking Alpha lays out risks such as volatility, and the decentralized nature of the asset. These factors will lead to unpredictability for Block Inc in regard to building products and projecting revenue streams. For instance, I believe that the company may face several dilemmas in balancing the decentralized nature of Bitcoin while also being in control of the system. In sum, the evolution of Bitcoin regulation will be an important determinant of the new start-up's success: ""The challenge and concern around Bitcoin regulation is how patchwork legislation across jurisdictions may hinder the growth and maturation of the crypto economy that is intended to be a borderless, open financial system."" ( Source: Coin Telegraph ) Conclusion In all, Block Inc is investing for growth. By investing in these new technologies, the company will have an expanded TAM of only $1,422 - 1,792 million today, but a staggering $77,100 - 399,300 million ten years from now. TAM (millions, USD) Today 2031/2032 TBD $280 - 650 $71,800 - $394,000 Bitkey $547 $3,600 MDK $595 $1,700 Source: Author's estimates The TAM that Block Inc is trying to capture is especially staggering when compared to the company's market cap. Data by YCharts Furthermore, I believe that these start-ups will significantly reinforce the potential for Block Inc to expand its closed-loop system outside of just Cash App and Square. Bitkey & MDK will allow users to efficiently mine, store, and send Bitcoin all within the same system. By bypassing card networks such as Visa ( V ) and Mastercard ( MA ) as well as banks, Block Inc will not need to pay transaction fees when customers, for example, send remittance payments to each other. The company has already built a closed-loop ecosystem with Square and Cash App, in which Cash App customers can pay Square merchants through the app. The emerging Bitcoin start-ups will be a further enabler of closed-loop ecosystems as the company builds out remittance services using Bitcoin on-off-ramps and potentially integrates these products with Cash App and Square. Ark Invest clearly displays the potential margin benefits for Block Inc if it had a fully closed-loop digital wallet ecosystem. Big Ideas 2023 Ark Invest Ark calculates the net take rate by dividing Block Inc's Gross Payment Volume ((GPV)) by its gross profit on transactions. For the full-year 2022, the company had a GPV of ~$203 billion and a gross profit on transactions was ~$2.337 billion lending a net take rate of 1.15%. If Block Inc instead had all transactions in a close loop, its gross profit on transactions would more than double to $203 billion x 2.6% = $5.287 billion. Ark mentions in their footnote that they expect Block Inc to share the expanded take rate with merchants and consumers in order to improve the ecosystem for its users. Therefore, it is more reasonable to expect that the net take rate will lie around 1.5-2% in the long run instead of 2.6%. Increasing gross profit margins coupled with increased GPV (note that GPV was ~$84 billion in 2018) could result in outsized returns for investors. For these reasons, I believe Block is a strong buy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4595063-block-startup-ecosystem-will-drive-growth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11931814.jpeg

The new collection features 47,000 tokens, which sold for $99 each, this time with limited one-of-one NFTs and autographed cards. Traders who purchased 47 tokens would be eligible for a dinner with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, while those who purchased 100 would not only win the dinner but also a unique one-of-a-kind collectible with new rarity traits.  The second collection features art that closely resembles that from Trump’s NFT debut in December, which also sold out within a day of release. The first collection was a surprise success and its floor price quickly jumped in the 24 hours following the sale, with prices on secondary marketplace OpenSea reaching 0.19 ether (ETH), or about $230 – more than double the original price. Trading volume also crept up to 900 ETH, or $1.08 million, on the day following the sale.  Recent filings also indicate that Trump made between $500,000 to $1 million from the NFT project via a licensing deal he inked with the collection’s creator.  However, the secondary market has cooled to Trump Trading Cards this time around.  According to OpenSea, the second series’ floor price is about 0.053 ETH, or about $108 – just a few dollars above the token’s original mint price. Its trading volume is 774 ETH, or about $1.5 million (the price of ether in December was about 40% lower than it is today).  While the price of ETH today is hovering around $2,000, the returns on the second collection are already looking lower for holders in terms of speculation and utility. The first collection boasted multiple sweepstakes featuring more opportunities to win real-life experiences such as a Zoom call with Trump himself, a dinner in Miami or a cocktail hour at Mar-a-Lago.  Momentum is slowing  Not long after the second series of Trump Digital Trading Cards dropped, Twitter users poked fun at the “cringy” artwork that was even more outlandish than the first series.  While many of the tokens appear in the same style as the first collection, with artwork of the former president in different outfits and backgrounds, the new tokens feature Trump participating in activities such as playing guitar at a concert, hosting a barbecue, as a “king” chess piece and even wrangling a lion.  “It's Trump's attempt to paint himself as the ‘alpha male’ he always wanted to be,” said independent journalist Ed Krassenstein on Twitter.  One of the rare NFTs depicting Trump as a King of Hearts is listed on OpenSea for 47 ETH, or about $94,000, though the highest bid on the collectible stands at 0.84 ETH, or about $1,600 at the time of writing.  Shortly after the second collection was released, Trump lamented its mint price of $99, claiming that he “could have raised the price much higher” and said he “will be given no ‘nice guy’ credit,” in doing so.  However, “nice guy credit” might not even be enough to increase sales on either collection.  According to data from OpenSea, the floor price of the first Trump Trading cards series has been slowly declining over the past 24 hours. Since Tuesday, the floor price has fallen from 0.2 ETH, or $400, to about 0.14 ETH, or about $280. Meanwhile, interest in the second collection appears to be waning too, with the number of sales dropping from highs seen earlier in the day.",NEUTRAL,ETH,ETH | MARKET | MATIC | REGULATION | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/19/trumps-second-nft-collection-sells-out-while-prices-on-first-collection-plunge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3c38d787a679eff0693701e52f4f8ff7d551b6b-1170x898.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11930837,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527617,1681930840,From Margin To Perpetuals: How Decentralized Exchanges Are Redefining DeFi Trading,"The decentralized finance (DeFi) space has been gaining tremendous traction over the last months, especially in the area of perpetual trading. The on-chain perpetual exchange sector has seen significant growth recently, with a total trading volume of $164.2 billion in Q1 2023. According to the DeFi researcher and analyst, Thor Hartvigsen, the on-chain perpetual exchange sector is poised for significant growth in the coming years, with projections of 10-20x growth. This growth is driven by the emergence of new protocols and the increasing number of traders moving on-chain, especially after the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX. Decentralized Perpetual Exchanges, The Future Of DeFi Trading? Hartvigsen’s analysis shows that, as the space matures, it is expected that the cumulative on-chain perpetual trading volume will increase to trillions per quarter. Related Reading: These Top 5 Cryptos Are Thriving Despite A Slippery Market Several decentralized exchanges such as DYDX, GMX, KWENTA, and GNS have emerged in the on-chain perpetual exchange space, offering unique features such as low fees, increased privacy, and the ability to trade various assets without the need for intermediaries. For example, dYdX was one of the first on-chain perpetual exchanges to launch in the DeFi space, and it has since gained significant traction. Despite a decrease in trading activity since 2021, dYdX still does more in daily trading volume than all of the other perp protocols combined, with a total trading volume of $913 billion. The analysis shows that when it comes to on-chain perpetual trading protocols, dYdX operates differently from its counterparts like GMX, gTrade, and Level. dYdX has a low trading-fee structure that is more similar to a centralized exchange (CEX). Furthermore, dYdX does not charge fees on the first $100,000 traded and allows users to avoid Ethereum gas on all deposits above $500. This low fee structure works to dYdX’s advantage as it attracts more traders to the platform, similar to how CEXs attract traders with their low fees. On the other hand, GMX is another of the leading on-chain perpetual exchange protocols, with a total trading volume of $100.5 billion and total fees of $148.2 million. Additionally, GMX is getting close to launching V2, which will introduce a new liquidity structure to the protocol, a large number of trading pairs, new asset classes, and much lower fees. Hartvigsen suggests that the success of GMX last year sparked the on-chain perpetual exchange narrative, with its novel liquidity model (GLP) and real yield distribution of fees to liquidity providers and $GMX stakers playing a significant role. The Road Ahead For DEXs Hartvigsen also highlights in his analysis that while the on-chain perpetual exchange sector is expected to grow significantly, it is unlikely that it will overtake centralized exchanges in perpetual trading volume due to CEXs’ larger marketing budgets and ability to onboard retail more easily. Related Reading: ADA 10% Rally Coincides With Cardano Foundation’s Annual Report Additionally, regulatory uncertainty remains a significant headwind for the sector, with tokens paid as a yield resembling securities to a significant extent. This could make larger entities from traditional finance more reluctant to invest in these tokens. Despite these challenges, Hartvigsen believes that the on-chain perpetual exchange sector has significant growth potential. The protocols mentioned above are the ones to watch, but new entrants could also emerge in the future, attracting significant liquidity.

Teneo, 3AC's liquidator, published a notice in February outlining its intent to sell an expansive list of NFTs estimated to be worth millions to recoup some losses. The Singapore-based hedge fund filed for bankruptcy in July.  In a press release on Wednesday, Sotheby's announced that it would be hosting a multi-part sale featuring NFTs from the Grails collection, formed as part of 3AC's asset portfolio primarily in 2021. Sotheby's refers to the contents of the Grails collection as ""some of the most significant digital artworks ever assembled.""  ""This unparalleled collection will be released in chapters across various sales formats ranging from private sales to auctions and will occur across multiple locations globally, each one highlighting some of the most coveted and top grails,"" Sotheby's wrote in its description of the collection.  Highlights from the impressive portfolio include rare generative art pieces, like Dmitri Cherniak’s Ringers #879, Snowfro’s Chromie Squiggle #1780, Tyler Hobbs’ Fidenza #216, Larva Labs’ Zombie CryptoPunk #6649 and Autoglyph #187. The first sales from the collection will take place during Sotheby’s marquee sale week this May in New York.  “Collections are often representative of the time and the place from which they were formed, telling a unique story through their artworks,"" said Michael Bouhanna, Sotheby's head of digital art and NFTs. ""This expansive collection marks an important moment in the rise of generative art on the blockchain in 2021, and was guided by the 3AC ethos of acquiring some of the highest quality and rarest works available on the market.""  Teneo said in a statement that it chose to partner with Sotheby's digital art team on the sale ""because we believe that they bring a best-in-class approach that will ultimately maximize the value of these assets on behalf of all creditors.”  The upcoming Sotheby's sales are not related to Starry Night Capital's impressive NFT portfolio. The Starry Night fund was set up by 3AC in partnership with well-known NFT collector Vincent Van Dough in August 2021. The NFTs in that collection were moved to a Gnosis Safe in October and are ""presently subject to an application before the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court in the High Court of Justice in the British Virgin Islands,"" according to Teneo's February filing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | SPONSORED,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/04/19/sothebys-auctioning-off-rare-nfts-from-3acs-seized-collection,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/cde0ce3dc3b5f5339189ba21d60543bf0a0a0426-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Crypto trading and payments inside Russia will still be banned, added Naiullina.  The country’s government is also working on a bill that will create a national agency to license and supervise cryptocurrency platforms operating in Russia, wrote local newspaper Vedomosti on Tuesday, citing Sergei Altukhov, a member of Russian parliament’s economic policies committee. Altukhov added that a new tax code will be introduced for miners as a part of the regulation.  Talking to a parliamentary fraction of the “New People” political party on Monday, Nabiullina said the central bank’s plan includes creation of special organizations that will be charged with mining crypto and processing payments for cross-border trade deals. It’s not clear what these organizations might yet be. BitRiver, one of Russia’s largest mining companies, previously partnered with the state-affiliated oil company Gazpromneft.  Digital assets issued inside Russia, in accordance with the local law passed in 2020, can also be used for such cross-border deals on a par with the global decentralized cryptocurrencies, Nabiullina added.  Naliullina’s deputy, Alexey Guznov, added that the Bank of Russia is currently in discussions with the government to define what kind of organizations can participate in the experiment, what their business models should look like and what banks they will be using. In the early stages of the experiment it likely will be government-sponsored companies, he said.

Bitcoin Core is an open-source project that relies on grants, stipends and the goodwill of its contributors.  So Mehta was, technically, a paid volunteer funded by grants from Spiral, a subsidiary of Jack Dorsey’s Block that focuses on funding Bitcoin development; The Human Rights Foundation; and Gemini, the Winklevoss twins’ crypto exchange.  Mehta began contributing to Bitcoin Core in August 2020 and primarily worked on improving Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol through Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 324 (BIP324). Bitcoin’s P2P protocol governs the communication between nodes in the network. That communication is currently public and not encrypted, making the network vulnerable to various attacks and vulnerabilities.  BIP324 seeks to reduce the potential of such attacks by introducing a version of the P2P protocol that encrypts messages between Bitcoin nodes.  Mehta, a former Google software engineer, didn’t elaborate on what his startup idea is, but he’s no stranger to the startup world. In 2013 Mehta launched Outbound, a messaging platform that raised $2.2 million and was eventually acquired by Zendesk in 2017.  “BIP324 is going into better hands than mine,” Mehta tweeted. “I have a Bitcoin startup idea I'm so excited about, some nights it's hard to sleep.

Bitcoin Korea Premium Index Has Turned Red In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the selling pressure has been rising in the sector recently. The “Korea Premium Index” is an indicator that measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on the South Korean exchanges and that listed on foreign platforms. When the value of this metric is positive, it means the price of the cryptocurrency listed on the South Korean exchanges is currently greater than that on the global ones. Such a trend suggests that there is a heavier amount of buying taking place on the former platforms right now compared to the latter ones (or alternatively, the Korean exchanges are just observing a lower amount of selling pressure). On the other hand, the indicator showing a negative value implies that South Korean investors may be selling more of the cryptocurrency compared to the rest of the world’s user base. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Korea Premium Index over the last few months: The value of the metric seems to have been quite red in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin Korea Premium Index has been very positive during most of the rallies in the last few months, suggesting that users of the South Korean exchanges have been heavily purchasing the cryptocurrency throughout the price surge. This constant buying pressure from these holders may be one of the reasons why the asset has been able to sustain an upwards trajectory in these recent months. Related Reading: Glassnode: 8/8 Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Confirm Recovery From Bear There have also been a few instances, however, where the indicator’s value has turned negative and the global investors have outpaced this cohort in terms of the buying pressure. The most notable recent instance of this trend was when Bitcoin broke above the $31,000 mark a few days back. The asset topped out above this level when the Korea Premium Index turned red, implying that it may be the selling from these holders that led to the coin’s decline. Many of the other occurrences of the metric showing negative values this year have also similarly provided resistance to the asset. Recently, the indicator has again turned red, suggesting that these investors may have started to distribute once more. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Exchange Whale Ratio Spikes The bearish impact from these red values didn’t immediately appear as the price in fact started climbing and went above the $30,000 mark shortly after. During the past day, however, this recovery has disappeared as the asset has sharply plunged below this level again. It’s uncertain whether this dip was all that was to come because of the selling pressure from the Korean investors, or if the cryptocurrency would be facing more pullback in the near term.

42394075,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVlI9,1681924908,Valuations and M&A Show Things Aren’t So Bad for Crypto,"Recent troubles in crypto (the collapse of FTX in November, runs on crypto-friendly banks in March, etc.) have brought into question the viability of the entire asset class. However, a closer look at the long-term performance of blockchain companies and crypto miners mitigates those doubts. Financial investors have remained active and M&A activity is still strong.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  This article will focus on two engines of the crypto world:  Blockchain tech companies and exchanges: Bakkt, Block, Coinbase and PayPal  Crypto miners: Canaan, Marathon Digital, Riot and Hive  Both sectors have performed dismally over the past 12 months relative to the Nasdaq Composite Index – which has also done terribly. The chart below shows the plunge in all their market caps (with a starting value of 100 for each in April 2022).  However, this observation must be put into perspective.  First, despite the pain, investors are now assigning a similar revenue multiple to those two crypto-related sectors and the Nasdaq. (We track that using enterprise value, or EV, divided by revenue.) The mining group especially has seen a massive rebound in that metric since the beginning of the year, coinciding with bitcoin’s (BTC) large rally.  Second, if we look at a wider time horizon (as illustrated below), the mining group still outperforms the Nasdaq between April 2020 and April 2023., winning 90% to 63%. The blockchain group is down 12%. Crypto miners benefitted from a huge bubble in the first half of 2021 (traded between 30x and 70 EV/revenue). From early 2022 to mid-2022, those extreme valuations normalized and converged around 3.5x EV/revenue. The Blockchain group, meanwhile, pretty closely tracks the Nasdaq, though with less volatility.  VC Investment and M&A Activity  There are still a number of very active financial investors in the crypto space. In 2022, there were 2,541 venture capital (VC) investments totalling $26.2 billion in crypto or blockchain companies. Some highlights: Celestia raised $53 million in a Series B round, Matter Labs raised $200 million in a Series B and Fenix Games completed early-stage rounds and raised $150 million.  As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the top 10 VC-backed companies have raised approximately $8.45 billion during their lifespan. Coinbase topped the ranking of the most active financial investors in crypto in the first quarter 2023 with 340 investments (including Amber, CoinDCX and CoinTracker), while NGC Ventures was in second position with 258 investments (Parami Control, Resource Finance, etc.). The top 10 financial investors are based in the U.S. (six of them), China (three), and Singapore (one).  Despite the shockwaves from the FTX bankruptcy filing in November, the ecosystem is still quite dynamic. Notable M&A deals closed in the fourth quarter include Gleec BTC Exchange acquiring Blocktane for $1.5 billion, Binance buying TokyoCrypto for $225 million and Bankless purchasing Earnifi for $150 million.  Conclusion  The valuation of crypto-related companies has converged with the rest of tech, a sign that the digital-asset industry is maturing. The recent crisis has pruned out non-viable players and investors are adopting a less speculative stance on this asset class. As crypto mining exemplifies, there may be room for certain subsectors of crypto to deliver superior performance compared with peers. Of particular interest are the blockchain security platforms – such as Fireblocks, Taurus or Copper – that offer solutions to protect digital assets like crypto. Valuations will be supported by specialized private investors and M&A activity driven by consolidation plays at the international level, either by geographic or technology consolidation.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,"Christophe Morvan, Julian Ostertag, Sam Levy",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/19/valuations-and-ma-show-things-arent-so-bad-for-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87266c183d301f03907aa69205216900e41fd8b5-2118x1191.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421087,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRq9,1681923785,Olaf Carlson-Wee: Crypto Is the Great Wealth-Redistribution Machine,"Olaf Carlson Wee is the prototypical “crypto bro.” He got in early, got rich and now spends his time investing and making art. He wears colorful, flamboyant clothes, has bleached his hair and has an electronic music studio in his home. In 2017, around the time of the initial coin offering (ICO) craze, Carlson-Wee made a name as a public figure as one of Coinbase’s earliest hires and expert voice. He wrote a blog about decentralized applications of blockchain, and argued tokens are not investment contracts, in part, because they have utility.  Olaf Carlson-Wee will be speaking at Consensus 2023, in Austin, Texas.  To hear him tell it, the most recent crypto bull run was less fun. Although still heavily invested and active in the crypto industry, he seemed to step back from the spotlight. He did give an interview to the très chic Interview Magazine (founded by Andy Warhol), where he described his post-college, pre-Coinbase life in a hippie enclave in Washington state and later in a Minnesota cabin. It was around then that he started seriously thinking deeply about crypto, a habit he has yet to kick. Ever since, Carlson-Wee has been on a mission to improve his life and the world – he believes in both meritocracy and wealth redistribution, and has a challenging view of what ""progress"" really means.  CoinDesk caught up with the part-time investor, part-time philosopher ahead of his appearance at Consensus 2023. Although prototypical in some sense, Carlson-Wee is also highly singular. The interview touches on artificial intelligence, techno-optimism and what he calls “super happiness.” It has been edited slightly for clarity and length.  Where do you land on the AI doomerism/optimism scale?  Yeah, so there's one thing I think is very important, and I'm surprised that this isn't the consensus view, which is that [artificial intelligence] is inevitable. The idea that every government, private company, every individual hacker in the world is going to sign and agree to, like, slow down AI research is jokingly nice. And it's very scary to me that people would rather hand over control of all this development to some sort of, you know, vague, global body that controls how we can develop and interact with AI systems – that would make decisions for the rest of humanity. Now this is out of the box, I don't think it's possible to stop, we can sort of predict the way things will go. Some trends are kind of obvious: There's going to be automation of a large swath of the current “white-collar labor market.” Consumer AI systems are really just better and more efficient versions of mental labor. But when it comes to longer-term trends, whether AI will destroy us – these things are fascinating. Through prompting AI you can actually get it to write software, explain to you how to download it and get it running on your machine – that’s how it escapes the box, right? It’ll become very tricky to discern, like, what is human and AI, or what was augmented. The weird effects here are emergent and hard to predict. When I think about it as an investor, and see algorithms that are trained on specific data, maybe the algorithm itself ends up being a commodity, which I think is something nobody exactly saw. You know, there's this sort of interface and application layer that actually ends up being the most valuable components themselves. I do think it's possible this is one of the singularity technologies where we create an AI to write code to create a better AI and it's like a recursive loop, which may lead to recursive loops with other novel technologies.  Is there an analogy to crypto here? As in, crypto that’s truly resilient and immutable, is it not only impervious to regulation but also inevitable?  I do not think it is possible to stop. The genie's out of the bottle. It's open-source, permissionless – anybody can sort of opt into this and start using it or start building their own version. Once you launch these things into the world that have those properties, I really do not think it is possible to stop them. You can slow them down in specific regions but the world is quite competitive. And, you know, different regions with perhaps more favorable rules creates economic incentives for other people to sort of support and facilitate that region. As an extreme example, suppose there was only one country in the entire world where AI development and cryptocurrency were legal, that country would very quickly become extraordinarily wealthy. Right? There is this sort of game theory of nations competing with each other where if you're not the country that controls the global reserve currency you might benefit from the development of crypto.  See also: What ChatGPT Thinks About Digital Assets  You cold-called Coinbase for your first job. What was it about Coinbase that made you want to join?  This is over 10 years ago, now. I was the 30th user of Coinbase. So there was a really tiny, like micro, micro crypto ecosystem – not by any means an industry, but [collectively] like an open-source software project and these little rinky-dink businesses built around it. In the early days of bitcoin, ironically, you could not buy it online because of payment processors (credit cards, PayPal, bank transfers) protecting against fraud. Interestingly, Brian [Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase] was an anti-fraud engineer at Airbnb. His original insight was building an app that allowed him to take online payments – basically becoming the first company where you could buy [bitcoin] online. It had a friendly interface. It was based in America. I was sort of waiting to see if it got hacked in the first couple months – back in those days the lifespan of a crypto wallet was measured in weeks. Eventually, after I started using Coinbase, I started to feel it was the model to take bitcoin mainstream. [It] handled custody, sending bitcoin to other people and logins to make account recovery possible. You could use it from your phone or computer, you're not going to a bank or meeting somebody in person. It was a killer company, the only company I applied to work for in my entire life.  In an interview you gave to Celo, which you’ve invested in, you said it was the best chance to get everyone around the world a banking-like system. This was a number of year ago, and I’m willing to say crypto generally and Celo in particular are still immature – but at the same time mass adoption has not happened as many have said it will. Is crypto still waiting to find its use case?  Crypto has, you know, over a trillion dollars of value. You can measure it in different ways, but let's call it 50 million different holders. So as a wealth preservation product, there's arguably substantial product market fit at this point. And, you know, I am a believer in these secure blockchain systems for different useful types of applications – for computation and diverse applications. We still have [to see] 10x growth in value just to get to gold parity, and just think how many new features crypto can support beyond what gold does. My absolute bear case is that crypto only reaches gold parity. But just think about the total addressable market of anybody who has any amount of savings. I mean, what [percentage] of people's wealth do they have in crypto? Anecdotally, over time the number tends to creep up – you kind of start out just holding bitcoin, then fast forward five years and, like, a huge chunk of your total wealth ends up being stored in these systems as you gain faith and confidence in them. So even if the only use case we ever have has already been discovered, I think we're in a relatively immature market with a huge amount of growth.  You mentioned earlier how countries that enable crypto development could become insanely wealthy, which reminded me of a quote you gave to Interview Magazine about rewriting the global economic and financial system to transfer wealth from “traditional elites to those in the cryptocurrency sphere.” Arguably, that has started to come true. Are you happy with the results so far?  When people look at a system like Bitcoin, and they have criticisms of it, like “this isn't real” or the fact that some people have more than others, these are all in some sense criticisms of the existing system of markets and capitalism. Most people have never thought about how it all works. For some people, criticizing crypto is the first time they ever take a first-principles approach to reasoning about what money is. Crypto is an alternative sociological belief system that questions what is legitimate. We all sort of agree on the legitimacy of the dollar, but it's still a social contract. The dollar is not like gravity, where we can measure it and reason about it in precise terms. Similarly, crypto is sociological – this movement to create a unified, global financial system relies on technology but it's also a shift in a belief system about what’s legitimate.  What should positive wealth redistribution look like then, should the government have a role in it?  You know, I think so. I started believing in a meritocratic system where people have different abilities and insights than others (which should not be a controversial insight). A global system of resource distribution is meant to appropriately distribute resources to people – with the most going to those who are going to help other people the most. That’s because they invest in themselves to invest in the world. I really do have a positive view on the whole thing. Like, I don't think the ability to centrally plan resource distribution makes any sense whatsoever because the world is so complex and chaotic. It’s way more unpredictable than any individual group or person could possibly wrap their head around. And so resource distribution is better from the ground up, like how the best way to build infrastructure is through open and permissionless innovation.  You have one life, just go for exactly the life you want  Does the idea that people have naturally different abilities or interests speak at all to your own or the wider tech community’s interest in transhumanism and life extension?  So, to be clear, for me personally I'm not that interested in life extension. I’m not that interested if we can get everybody to live to 120 instead of 90. I'm much more interested in, I hate this term but, improving “quality of life.” One of the core insights from the early transhumanist thinkers is whether we are genuinely orders of magnitude happier than our ancestors. Are people who have built up a lot of resources orders of magnitude happier than your average person who has access to a normal level of resources? I don't need a scientific study to anecdotally know the answer is no. The differences in well-being and happiness are actually not that dramatic between people in the past or across different societies. And so what I'm very interested in is, you know, our hardware, so to speak, our brains and bodies is the result of a kind of Darwinian evolution. We can use different technological approaches to sort of optimize ourselves not for reproduction but actually for happiness and well-being. So I'm much more interested in improving what you might call “super happiness.”  If you had to decide between dying tomorrow or living forever, what would you choose?  Do I have to live forever?  Yeah, one or the other.  I'm gonna pass on answering that one because I honestly need to think about it. Being forced to be alive forever – that's very very scary in a way. Broadly, I want more life, not less. It's not like I'm against living longer but I would rather have an extremely fulfilling and happy life than a long, monotonous, hard life.  Any recommendations for people who want to live a happier, more fulfilled life?  That's a big question. If I was just doing bullet points, the big one is you have one life, just go for exactly the life you want. Don't let anybody else judge you or change that path. Develop your own view of what you want your life to be and never ever stop chasing after it.  That's a good answer. I spoke to someone you hired at Coinbase who described it as a ragtag team back in the day. Now that you're an investor do you miss the more hands-on experience of coding and managing a team? Do you take an active role in the companies you invest in?  It absolutely was a super ragtag team. I am a huge believer in supporting outsiders that have great insights, but not a lot of social or material proof. I love supporting outsiders and people who are thinking differently. And I still love supporting and getting involved in those kinds of early stages and being the first believer for somebody. But I think I got a lot of the “operational firefighting” out of my system at Coinbase. I was there for three and a half years, and think I did about a career-worth of work. Investing is cerebral.  See also: What Are VCs Funding After FTX? More Decentralized Infrastructure  Do you have a favorite book?  My favorite authors are David Foster Wallace and Cormac McCarthy. If I had to pick one book, it might be “Infinite Jest,” which is kind of DFW’s magnum opus.  That book changed my life.  Yeah, I get it. The first time I read it, I read it in like a week, which means reading for probably six, seven hours a day. As an author, DFW captures extraordinarily well what it feels like to be a person and have consciousness. I really felt like he was inside my brain. I have two older brothers who are authors, and my parents were ministers full time for about three decades each, both retired now. They were both English professors before they were ministers.  A family of readers and writers.  Yeah, it was a literary family.  This was pretty solid, I think we could call it here. Anything you’d like to add or highlight?  [Olaf]: I mean, Carissa … anything you think …  [Carissa, a representative for Gasthalter & Co. who arranged the call]: It was a nice conversation, I think. I don't know, maybe I've seen you more energized about the space right now than ever before. What about your general take on what's happening in crypto overall?  Yeah, actually, let's go there.  You know, the general feeling is that crypto is the underdog. It's subversive. It’s not the obvious thing. It's sort of like this contrarian place to be that’s shrouded in obscurity. All that stuff. That’s what I've always found really motivating about crypto. The flicker of broad, mainstream awareness and attention around in 2021 was actually like the least interesting time for me personally. So I've just been really invigorated by a return to building out of the spotlight and refocusing on really fundamentally, building systems that can support the global financial system. Rather than, you know, hype and media attention that comes with these sort of big market movements.  1. Are you still deploying capital? 2. If founders are reading this, what would get your attention?  We are. We have been for almost seven years. The core proposition has never really changed for me, which is low-level protocols and infrastructure. It's always been an area I have a huge intellectual interest in. But if you have a breakthrough concept – whether it's a new invention or novel economic model – come talk to me. That's what we specialize in, the stuff that nobody else gets.

SEC Chair Fails To Clarify On ETH’s Status That Gensler failed to clarify the status of ETH before the House Financial Services Committee on April 18 can be problematic. Gary Gensler getting grilled on whether he thinks ETH is a security or commodity Enjoy pic.twitter.com/vrFVn3Ap63 — sassal.eth 🦇🔊 (@sassal0x) April 18, 2023 Rep. Patrick McHenry, the committee chair, pressed Gensler to state whether ETH was a commodity or a security—meaning the asset must be regulated by the SEC and engaging entities must register to transact. However, Gensler failed to answer the question saying he didn’t want to “pre-judge”. This statement is despite the SEC taking enforcement actions and serving Wells Notices to several cryptocurrency companies in the past few months.

In the meantime, without clarity and the SEC demanding platform offering staking services to register, ETH and tokens of proof-of-stake networks would likely remain under pressure. Ethereum Drops Below $2,000 When writing on April 19, ETH prices have fallen below the psychological $2,000 level, dropping 8% in the last few hours.

From the Ethereum daily chart, the collapse of prices on April 19 has unwound the gains of April 14. It continues to heap pressure on buyers from last week. Still, even at spot rates, the uptrend remains firm. ETH is up 40% from mid-March and 72% from December 2022 lows. Ethereum Price On April 19 | Source: ETHUSDT On Binance, TradingView Whether this trend will continue and Ethereum buyers flow back depends on the reaction of prices in the next few trading session. The key reaction points going forward are April 2023 highs at $2,140, acting as resistance; and $1,900 on the lower end. While the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed Bitcoin to be a commodity, the silence from the SEC on ETH’s status could negatively impact ETH and how conservative investors perceive the second-largest cryptocurrency. Institutional investors often conduct their due diligence so they don’t have exposure to unregistered securities. The SEC is yet to issue clarity on the precise classification of ETH, which is negative for the coin.

Best known for his 2007 hit ""Crank That,"" Soulja Boy has in recent years expressed an interest in cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. The rapper bragged about bitcoin gains on the 2018 track ""Bitcoin"" and released a 3D NFT collection earlier this month.  According to ZachXBT, Soulja Boy tweeted about various crypto projects and NFTs 73 times since March 2021. In particular, ZachXBT cites a complaint made by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March, charging Soulja Boy and other celebrities like Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, Akon and Ne-Yo with promoting tronix (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT) without disclosing compensation. He also pumped a now-defunct token called RAPDOGE in 2021.  ZachXBT also points to promotions of tokens like SaferMars, which turned out to be a rug pull scam. According to ZachXBT, Soulja Boy's promotions to his millions of followers across social media are estimated to have netted him over $730,000.  Soulja Boy did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  Celebrities continue to face growing scrutiny over their promotion of NFTs and other crypto tokens without proper disclosure.

The company operates a blended business model that generates revenue from self-mining, compute hosting, and cloud mining. At the end of June 2022, Bitdeer had about $334 million in cash and crypto. The Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining industry has yet another organization that has entered the public markets. On Friday, Singapore-based Bitdeer Technologies Group ( BTDR ) went public via SPAC merger with Blue Safari Group Acquisition Corp. The combined company now trades on the Nasdaq ( NDAQ ). While it is yet another BTC miner with a 9-figure market cap, Bitdeer is a very different type of business from what we've previously seen from other Bitcoin mining names in the public equity markets. Mining Model Rather than running a fully integrated business like Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) or an asset light model like Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Bitdeer has more of a blended approach where it self-mines, offers hosting services, and provides cloud mining at the consumer level. It's a bit like combining the models of Riot, Compute North, and StormGain all under one company. Bitdeer provides these services through 5 different data centers that are located in Washington, Texas, and Tennessee, with two more in Norway. The Texas and Norway locations are leased while the company owns the Washington and Tennessee properties: Global Footprint (Prospectus, Page 207) As of the end of June 2022, Bitdeer says to have 522MW of capacity in use with 452MW under construction and an additional 400MW planned. At the end of January, Bitdeer stated 16.2 total EH/s capacity: Hashrate As of 1/31/23 Proprietary 4.1 EH/s Hosting 12.1 EH/s Source: Prospectus, page 143 Of that total 16.2 EH/s mining capacity, 4.1 EH/s is used for self-hosting and 12.1 EH/s is used for providing hosting services to other companies and to consumers. Company filings That level of self-hosted mining made Bitdeer the 7th largest publicly traded miner by EH/s at the end of January 2023. This puts Bitdeer more in what I'd call the ""second tier"" of BTC miners based purely on that metric. Balance Sheet & Revenue From a balance sheet standpoint, all we have to go off of is the mid-year 2022 numbers. Bitdeer has nearly $331 million in cash, $3.1 million in cryptocurrencies, and a total of $659.7 million in assets against $342.4 million in liabilities. Balances (Bitdeer) The company generally converts all of its crypto mining revenue into fiat and actually held almost no BTC on the balance sheet as of end of June 2022: Crypto balance breakout (Bitdeer) Not pictured in the table above is FileCoin ( FIL-USD ) which makes up over 59% of Bitdeer's crypto holdings. The next largest crypto holding for the company is Tether ( USDT-USD ). From a revenue breakout standpoint, it appears that proprietary mining was becoming a larger portion of the company's revenue up until last year when it went from 50.7% of total revenue for the six months ended June in 2021 to just 22.8% of total revenue in the first half of 2022: Revenue Breakout (Bitdeer) The big growth area for Bitdeer was in the cloud hash rate category. This model is interesting because the company charges an upfront fee for providing the mining services and the user then gets to keep the mining reward. For this to work long term, the user's mining reward has to be larger than the upfront cost of using the service. If crypto prices decline too far, that arrangement becomes unprofitable and the consumer stops using the service. In the company's prospectus, it noted diminished demand for its cloud hosting business last year because of the poor sentiment in the crypto market more broadly: For the hash rate sharing and hosting businesses, the demand for such products has become lower due to the relatively bearish market on Bitcoin and the crypto asset market in general. It's too early to tell if those clients have come back online with Bitcoin's recent rise above $30k but it's certainly possible. Bitdeer has estimated annual revenue at the end of 2022 to be $330.3 million compared to $394.7 million the year prior. The company attributed the decline to a decrease in the BTC price, an inability to keep proprietary mining growth inline with global network hash growth, and a decrease in the revenue from the hosted business. Something else to consider is this company only appears to have about a six month history of profitability: Operating results (Bitdeer) From 2019 to 2021, it looks like the second half of 2021 was actually negative from a profitability standpoint. Which is not a great sign in my view considering the broader crypto market was at all time highs in November of that year. As has occasionally been the case in this industry, it seems like share-based compensation for Bitdeer cut into profitability quite a bit when the crypto market was roaring in the second half of 2021. Valuation vs Peers Since this company still has less than a full week of trading action post-SPAC merger, comps to peers will be somewhat limited. But we can already see Bitdeer is getting a sizeable $745 market capitalization as of Tuesday's closing price: Data by YCharts Bitdeer is apparently worth more than Bitfarms ( BITF ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ) combined despite no meaningful BTC position to speak of, more debt than both companies combined, and less self-mining EH/s capacity as of January 2023. The advantage Bitdeer does have over all three of those companies is an enormous cash position. Still, BTDR is trading at 2.3x book value: Data by YCharts This is a much richer valuation compared to mining peers of similar self-mining EH/s size. Even after a 33% slide from the $10 pre-merger share price, I don't think these BTDR shares are a strong value yet. Especially considering we don't have updated balance sheet financials for the end of 2022 at this time. Summary Every risk associated with Bitcoin mining generally speaking applies to Bitdeer as well. While I'm not as concerned about jurisdiction risk domestically given the company's mining properties are in states like Tennessee and Texas, I do think we need updated information before taking a stab at BTDR shares at more than 2x book value. It's certainly possible Bitdeer is managing a diversified mining business that will reward shareholders well following B itcoin's halving next year. But I'd personally wait for a couple fresh quarters of data before jumping into this one.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4595005-bitdeer-too-early-to-tell-spac-merger-miner?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/11926879.jpeg

Magi is still in development and months away from being a production-ready offering, according to an announcement posted by crypto engineer Noah Citron.  The project is a new client for OP Stack, the standardized, open-source development stack that powers Optimism. The system is written using the Rust programming language and is meant to serve as a faster alternative to op-node, the only existing rollup client that’s maintained by OP Labs and written in the Go programming language. A16z’s thesis is that more systems make for more robust decentralization for Optimism, and the addition of one based on Rust will attract more developers.  A client is broadly any type of software application that can allow a user to interact with a blockchain.  “Magi acts as the consensus client (often called a rollup client in the context of the OP Stack) in the traditional execution/consensus split of Ethereum,"" wrote Citron in the post. ""It feeds new blocks to the execution client in order to advance the chain,"" he continued. ""Magi performs the same core functionality as the reference implementation (op-node) and works alongside an execution node (such as op-geth) to sync to any OP Stack chain, including Optimism and Base.""  On Tuesday, Citron tweeted out an orange dot with “coming soon,” which Twitter users tied to Coinbase’s similar tweet of a blue dot ahead of its Optimism-based layer 2 announcement. A16z Chief Technology Officer Eddy Lazzarin responded, saying his firm wasn’t working on a layer 2 blockchain.  UPDATE (April 19 2023, 16:44 UTC): Adds quote from a16z announcement post.

Ethereum Remains Volatile ETH, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, is under immense pressure when writing. Although the uptrend remains, and the coin has generally posted impressive results over the last four months, the price drop today has led to the biggest liquidation of ETH long positions in over one month. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Stuck In Key Range And 100 SMA Could Spark Fresh Increase According to Coinglass data, ETH long positions were also wrecked on March 22 when over $31 million were forcefully closed. On average, less than $10 million of ETH longs have been closed on other trading days in the last month. The magnitude of long or short liquidation can be used to measure general volatility in the market. Volatility indicates how fast or slow an asset price moves within a given period. Depending on the general liquidity, asset prices can move at different paces. In crypto, the most liquid assets, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, are usually less volatile than altcoins, for example, those outside the top 50. $41 Million Of ETH Longs Liquidated From the $41 million ETH longs liquidated, a big chunk is in OKX and Binance. These are some of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges that support the derivatives trading of crypto assets. By supporting margin, perpetual futures, and other derivatives, OKX and Binance traders can use leverage to trade bigger positions than they would ordinarily be able to. Although leverage can amplify gains, it risks the trader’s account when prices move against their prediction. The drop of ETH prices from $2,100 moved against leverage traders in, among other platforms, Binance and OKX, leading to tens of millions of dollars being liquidated. By liquidating a position, the exchange forcefully closed the long position and secured the margin since it couldn’t cover the ongoing loss. How quickly a position can be liquidated also depends on the leverage level. Traders with high leverage and trading bigger positions in a volatile market stand a higher risk of having their positions liquidated.

Within 30 minutes (assuming you’re not trying during rush hour, which is key here) it’s possible to disconnect from La La Land on a canyon or ridge trail with only the occasional interruption from a fellow hiker and/or fitness influencer. Here, conversations can flow freely, punctuated with the occasional Google fact check when cell service allows.  “Do you think ChatGPT will replace your role?” I asked my data scientist friend, who works for a large tech firm in the midst of layoffs. “No, my job requires too much specific context,” she responded succinctly, acknowledging the protective barriers and moats created by proprietary corporate datasets.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Anyway, what does ChatGPT think about crypto – and does that thinking pose a threat to investment writers and strategists?  Let’s make an assumption: Its views ought to reflect the “average” opinion of the information and sentiment embedded in the data sources on which it was trained. The AI bot should give some sense of the consensus view on digital assets, a collective zeitgeist constructed from an advanced statistical exercise.  Or at least that’s the idea. I decided to find out what ChatGPT thinks.  Prompt: Explain bitcoin to a high school student.  ChatGPT: Bitcoin is a type of digital money that people can use to buy things online. But instead of being printed or minted like traditional money, it's made using computer code and stored on a public ledger called the blockchain.  Bitcoin is different from regular money because it's decentralized, meaning it's not controlled by any government or financial institution. Transactions are processed directly between users without the need for intermediaries like banks or credit card companies.  Because [b]itcoin is decentralized, it offers a level of privacy and security that traditional financial systems cannot match. However, its value can be volatile and there are risks associated with investing in it.  Overall, [b]itcoin represents a new way to transact and store value digitally, and is seen by some as a potential hedge against inflation or as a store of value like gold.  Decentralization, disintermediation, store of value, not controlled by any government, like gold – all common and consistent themes supporting the bitcoin narrative. Let’s keep going:  Prompt: Are cryptocurrencies useful? Please explain in simple terms.  ChatGPT: Cryptocurrencies can be useful for several reasons. Here are some of the most common:  Decentralization: Cryptocurrencies like [b]itcoin and [ether] are decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any central authority or government. This can make transactions faster, cheaper and more secure.  Global access: Cryptocurrencies can be accessed and used by anyone with an internet connection, regardless of where they are in the world. This can be particularly useful for people who do not have access to traditional banking systems or for cross-border transactions.  Transparency: Cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public ledger called the blockchain, which means they are transparent and can be verified by anyone. This can increase trust and reduce the risk of fraud.  Programmability: Some cryptocurrencies like [ether] allow developers to create decentralized applications that can run on the blockchain. These applications can be used for a wide range of purposes, including finance, gaming, voting and supply chain management.  However, it is important to keep in mind that cryptocurrencies are still a relatively new technology and are subject to high volatility and regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, cryptocurrencies are not yet widely accepted as a form of payment and may not be suitable for everyone. As with any investment or financial decision, it is important to do your own research and consider your individual circumstances before investing in cryptocurrencies.  It sang a similar song of decentralization, disintermediation and transparency, albeit with an inclusion of smart contracts, a global perspective and a healthy financial risk disclaimer. It’s useful to remember that ChatGPT’s training data included information up until September 2021, coincidentally around the peak of the last bull market. A quick prompt of “What is FTX and who is Sam Bankman-Fried?” confirms a lack of awareness of, well, you know what happened a few months ago.  ChatGPT’s reference to the global nature of cryptocurrencies is a good reminder that digital assets make it easier to make cross-border remittance payments and provide a decentralized and trusted open-source alternative for regional or local financial services and infrastructure. It’s all too easy to overlook these critical use cases, because people like me mostly take them for granted as part of modern life in a developed economy, absent the infrequent banking crisis. Preference for this more banal use case can clearly be seen when comparing Google Trend search data for Bitcoin versus Ethereum (see below).  Here, the search activity for Bitcoin and Ethereum have been combined to create a relative ratio of activity, with the intent to proxy user interest. A value of 1 would suggest an equal amount of search activity within a country is spread across Bitcoin and Ethereum; 10 means 10 times more searches for Bitcoin than Ethereum. Given that BTC currently has about 2.3 times more market capitalization than ETH, it’s not surprising that no ratio in the chart above is much below that number. Switzerland at 2.3 is neutral (as usual), aka in line with market cap expectations.  Russia, Egypt and Nigeria show substantially more interest in bitcoin over ether, while Serbia, China and Switzerland (the Ethereum Foundation is based in Switzerland) are relatively more interested in Ethereum. From a glance at the countries within the top and bottom of bitcoin/ether search activity bins, we could conclude that developing and frontier economies are more focused on store of value and decentralized payment system utilities, whereas developed economies are more interested in refining and upgrading existing financial technology infrastructure via blockchain rails and smart contract platforms.  Read more: ChatGPT Will Kill Search and Open a Path to Web3  Just as we prompt ChatGPT for answers, we receive prompts for new questions and analysis. Who exactly is prompting whom?  Prompt: Will AI replace investment analysts? Please answer in haiku  ChatGPT: AI aids analysis,  But cannot replace the skills,  Humans still needed.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here’s some news worth reading:  BIG RELIEF: With last week’s big Ethereum upgrade, the scary narrative in the runup was this: The change enabled people to unstake ETH they’d staked to run the network, so what if there’s a rush for the exits? Won’t that tank ETH’s price? It didn’t happen. In the initial moments after the upgrade went live, the cryptocurrency held steady just above $1,900. Hours later, ETH zoomed above $2,100. What’s more, there’s evidence there was an inflow, not outflow, of money into ETH in the aftermath. This raises a question: Does the ability to stake and then unstake any time improve the case for investing in ETH? Is it more alluring to investors now the barrier to getting your money back is gone?  BULL MARKET: Given how ugly the regulatory news is around crypto, it’s hard to believe there’s talk that a bull market is upon us. And yet that’s just what analysts at brokerage firm Bernstein proposed this week. To them, the November collapse of FTX got rid of “toxic” leverage from the industry, and the macro environment looks favorable for bitcoin (BTC). “Any potential dislocation, whether on the bank’s credit side, or on the sovereign side … positions bitcoin perfectly as a safe-haven asset alongside gold,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote. BTC has nearly doubled since New Year’s Eve, so this – surprisingly – doesn’t feel outlandish.  SPEAKING OF FTX: An attorney representing FTX in bankruptcy court said one option being explored as the firm tries to recover money for creditors is relaunching the formerly large crypto exchange. FTX’s FTT token doubled in price in reaction to the news. I’m reminded of a nice recent story from my colleagues Oliver Knight and Helene Braun that argued reopening FTX faces an uphill climb given how poorly regarded its technology was.  PEPE COINS: Elon Musk recently generated interest in tokens with Shiba Inu mascots. Why, like so much in crypto, doesn’t matter. But those dog coins are old news now, CoinDesk’s Shaurya Malwa reports. Degens have moved on to coins with Pepe the Frog logos. If there was a punchline or takeaway, it would go here.

42387689,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQnG7B,1681919099,EU Lawmakers Skeptical on Digital Euro Plans,"The European Union’s elected lawmakers seem skeptical about the point of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as the bloc prepares to make key decisions on a digital euro in the coming months.  During a Wednesday debate, members of the European Parliament raised concerns over privacy, state control and the role of banks, and some are starting to wonder if the project is worth pursuing at all.  “There's one central question which hasn't yet been credibly answered, which is what is the added value …. What can I do with a digital euro that I can't do with current payment options?” asked Markus Ferber, economic spokesperson for the center-right European People's Party. “As long as there's no answer to this question, there's going to be a great deal of skepticism.”  That view appears to be shared by some in the center-left Socialists and Democrats grouping, the next biggest in the chamber.  “The question we have to ask is why are we doing it, and with what goal,” said French lawmaker Aurore Lalucq. “We're jumping onto the digital bandwagon because it's fashionable, and trying to deliver it with forceps … I think you need to be extremely careful.”  The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to make a formal decision about whether to issue the digital euro later this year. But officials are keen to gain lawmakers' consent for any legislation that would be needed to accompany the CBDC.  “If we don't provide our own solution, then we run the risk of private stablecoins or foreign central bank digital currencies filling the gap,” the European Commission’s Mairead McGuinness told lawmakers, adding that “a digital euro could support more innovation and payments such as machine to machine payments.”  McGuinness, the commissioner responsible for financial services policy, is due to publish a bill next month that she said will cover the euro’s status as legal tender, the compensation that private operators would receive for distributing the currency and privacy – an issue that topped a 2021 ECB poll of public concerns about the plans.  “This is not a ‘Big Brother’ project,” McGuinness said. “We should not address this issue to citizens in this chamber as any sense of a project of control … it's a project of choice.”  Some lawmakers, concerned that private-sector projects like the now-abandoned Facebook libra stablecoin could usurp the role of central banks, may be swayed by those arguments. Others are worried about the authoritarian implications of greater state control.  “I was told that we need this so we can compete with China,” said Michiel Hoogeveen, a Dutch lawmaker from the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists Group. “Back in the day, we would counter Communist China with policies of rollback or containment, not by copying it.”  Others said they were concerned the ECB is under the thumb of bank lobbyists, and that planned restrictions such as caps on holdings could unduly clip the CBDC’s wings.  “Some of the existing interests which fear the disruptive impact of the digital euro are trying to hamper the design,” said Ernest Urtasun of the parliament’s Green grouping. “What's crucial is the development of this project. We cannot leave it in the hands of the ECB and the technical advice that they have, which is coming from the private banking sector.”  Read more: EU Merchants Could Be Required to Accept Digital Euro, Ministers Told",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/04/19/eus-digital-euro-plans-meet-with-lawmaker-skepticism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/652b3b374e31a649ca522fb1785d61f7c5ec54b1-2212x1244.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move comes about seven months after Microsoft's venture capital arm, M12, led a $20 million strategic funding round for Space and Time.  The marketplace is the online store providing applications and services for use on Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, which came in behind only Amazon Web Services among the largest cloud infrastructure services providers in the world in the fourth quarter, according to Statista data.  Space and Time offers real-time data indexed from major blockchains combined with off-chain datasets provided by customers. The end result is a hybrid transactional and analytic database that’s pre-loaded with real-time blockchain-native data.  The one-click deployment through the Azure Marketplace gives developers the ability to access, manage and perform analytics on the blockchain data. Businesses can build on the blockchain without revamping their existing tech architecture.  “Partnering with Microsoft makes a lot of sense for us and to build with Azure adds a tremendous amount of value for our organization as we build these pillars to ensure that the world has verifiable data in a time where the complexity of data and the transparency of data is going to be more vital than it's ever been,” Space and Time co-founder and CEO Nate Holiday told CoinDesk in an interview.

This price behavior demonstrated the token’s resilience even as the global crypto market cap tanked by over 4%. Although OKB has registered some price drops today, it traded bullish yesterday, closing at 4.62% gains. Its trading volume has increased by 54.47%, depicting increased network activity. The Sui airdrops on the OKX web3 wallet after its mainnet launch must have increased user activity for OKB. What Could Be Pushing OKB’s Price? Sui Network is a layer-1 blockchain and Smart Contract platform designed to scale digital asset ownership. Sui makes crypto assets ownership fast, secure, private, and easily accessible to everyone. Related Reading: These Top 5 Cryptos Are Thriving Despite A Slippery Market Sui’s mainnet launch comes up in Q2 of 2023, and the network provided $5,000 worth of Sui token airdrops to OKX users. This could be fueling the rally in OKB price. Aside from the Sui token airdrop, the OKB ecosystem promotes Web3 gaming activities. That could be another factor pushing OKB’s price as the Web3 space rapidly expands. Following historical data, OKB has recorded an incredible price increase since the start of April. As of April 4, OKB traded at $40.77. It started rising gradually to $43.43 on April 13. Then on April 14, the token experienced a massive price surge of 16%, pushing it to $50.45 within 24 hours. It didn’t end there. The token continued rising bullishly and hit $55.88 on April 15, another 10% price increase in 24 hours. Unfortunately, OKB experienced a slight pullback from $55.88 to $53.17 on April 16. It quickly recovered momentum and rose by 4.62% from $52.32 on April 17 to $54.73 on April 18. OKB’s bullish price movement is why it could retain a 23.75% increase over the past seven days despite the market-wide downturn. At press time, OKB is trading at $51.80, with a high of $55.09 and a low of $51.30 over the past 24 hours. OKB Price Outlook In The Coming Days OKB is trading in a sideways trend today, recording a pullback from yesterday’s closing price of $54.73. It is bearish today and has formed a red candle on the chart. However, OKB found support at the 78.6% Fibonacci level ($51.746), which has sustained the asset’s price in the last three days. It is also struggling as the bears at the 100% Fibonacci level ($54.938) keep pushing the price down. Related Reading: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Binance Whale Games And More OKB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 61.10 in the neutral zone. Currently, the indicator is moving downwards, exhibiting a bearish trend. However, the asset is trading above its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a short and long-term bullish sentiment. OKB will likely bounce off the 78.6% Fib level and rally again in the short term.

42387675,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQnGGX,1681915478,Democrats Blast Draft Stablecoin Bill in First 2023 Hearing on Issue,"Skeptical remarks from key Democrats Wednesday are bringing into question the chances for U.S. stablecoin legislation that the crypto industry has been relying on as the first real oversight effort from Congress.  The House Financial Services Committee held its first hearing on stablecoins in 2023 on Wednesday in connection with a discussion draft bill that was created by Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) last year and that was published over the past weekend. And while Republicans praised the effort that went into the bill, Democrats called it outdated.  In her opening statement, Waters said the bill was a joint effort, but negotiations over its provisions remained incomplete, and “unfortunately, a lot of things happened in between” last fall and Wednesday, such as the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.  ""Mr. McHenry alarmed me somewhat when he said that the members on his side of the aisle had come up with a whole new bill,"" Waters said. ""The posted bill in no way represents ... negotiations between the two of us ... I think we're starting from scratch.""  Waters added later in the hearing that the committee should move ""very quickly"" on an updated bill.  Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), chairman of the subcommittee holding the hearing, took a different tone, calling the bill a bipartisan baby “named Maxine McHenry.”  “It's here today for both sides of the aisle to review and consider and to hear from our panelists. So today we're going to discuss it, think about revisions. How do we address the benefits and risks described in the Biden administration's 2021 report on stablecoins?” he said during his opening remarks.  His counterpart across the aisle, Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the senior Democrat on the digital-assets subcommittee, said lawmakers should question ""whether stablecoins are even needed."" He said the draft language released by Republicans is ""outdated"" and doesn't reflect any lessons learned from the implosion of major crypto firms last year.  Still, the need for a federal bill on stablecoins is apparent, said McHenry, chairman of the Financial Services Committee.  “It is important for us internationally and domestically. It's very important that we have that understanding on a bipartisan basis, the utility and importance of this legislation,” he said.  The House stablecoin effort was the most promising crypto work taking place in Congress last year, with the top members of the committee agreeing on most of the key points as the Treasury Department also weighed in. But McHenry and then-chairwoman Waters were unable to get it to the finish line in the committee. Since then, there's been no substantial talks between the parties.  Regulating stablecoins – tokens affixed to steady assets such as the U.S. dollar – has been a priority of U.S. financial agencies that see them as potential threats to future financial stability, and lawmakers from both parties argued that this narrow slice of the industry could be handled more easily than a more comprehensive bill.  One of the primary sticking points has been the question of whether any legislation can win the necessary support of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. So far, he hasn't made any definitive comments about his position, and other Democrats in his committee have suggested that granting the industry any tailored oversight may just encourage a sector they think is too dangerous to exist at all.  A spokesperson for Brown previously told CoinDesk that stablecoins aren't used for payments now and that Brown was “continuing to look carefully at all the different approaches his colleagues have put forward.""

42394062,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvVjy5,1681914569,The Big Issues of Stablecoin Issuance,"This morning, the House Financial Services Committee is discussing the future of stablecoins under U.S. regulation. The committee will hear testimony from five experts, although notably it appears only two of those actually represent the crypto industry: Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle, and Jake Chervinsky, chief policy officer of the Blockchain Association.  Chervinsky’s testimony, released ahead of the hearing, breaks down stablecoin regulatory issues with the grounded clarity that smart lawyers often bring to the rhetorically overheated crypto world. His testimony on its own would serve well as the basis for future effective stablecoin regulation.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  First, there’s the question of what these instruments accomplish that merits regulatory legitimization. Stablecoins provide utility for individuals around the world seeking the stability of the U.S. dollar. As Chervinsky points out, this potentially benefits the U.S. by “reinforcing the dominance of the U.S. dollar as the global reserve currency at a time when that status is under threat by foreign adversaries like China and Russia.”  As I’ve written before, the dollar doesn’t face a particularly imminent threat to its reserve status, but there’s still good reason to strategically preempt the possibility. On a more nuanced, strategic level, widely available and well-regulated dollar-backed stablecoins would likely go a long way to kneecapping China’s grandest plans for its “digital yuan” central bank digital currency (CBDC). Because of the evidence that the digital yuan includes powerful surveillance and censorship features, which could ultimately reach well beyond China’s borders, this would be a service to the world.  Chervinsky’s most important and interesting point is that lawmakers and regulators should focus on privately managed stablecoins, rather than a federally issued CBDC. A well-constructed and publicly overseen CBDC would likely be the best path forward in a vacuum, if nothing else because it would be of lower risk for users.  But Chervinsky’s stance acknowledges the unfortunate political reality that there is virtually no chance the U.S. would create a cash-like CBDC without built-in surveillance. Privacy, particularly among centrist Democrats, has unfortunately lost much of its appeal as a principle of American society. As many have quipped, if printed cash were invented today its completely untraceable nature would probably be anathema to many legislators.  These House hearings are as much about educating lawmakers and the public as anything else, and Chervinsky does yeoman’s work here as well. Specifically, he breaks down the differences among three types of stablecoins: custodial, decentralized and algorithmic. Rightly, he argues that regulatory efforts should focus on formalizing the structure of custodial stablecoins, such as Circle’s USDC, which hold dollar instruments in a bank to back up circulating tokens.  “Decentralized” stablecoins here refer to structures such as MakerDAO, whose DAI stablecoin is overcollateralized, largely by other crypto assets. These structures are highly experimental and, as Chervinsky says, should be provided breathing room to develop – though given the recent stance of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the chances of that may not be good.  Finally, Chervinsky is diplomatic when it comes to what are known as “algorithmic” stablecoins, which are sometimes partly backed by other assets but are typically undercollateralized. Chervinsky says that it’s “uncertain” whether algo stablecoins might ever be viable. If I have one quibble with the testimony it’s this: The truth is that algo stablecoins are almost certainly the financial equivalent of the perpetual motion machine scam. While I wouldn’t personally advocate for making them outright illegal, I certainly wouldn’t raise a big stink.  See also: Centralized Stablecoins Are Problematic. Is a Decentralized One Possible? | Opinion  Given the proposed focus on collateralized stablecoins, Chervinsky lays out the relevant regulatory questions. These include providing “a regulated path for both banks and nonbanks” to issue stablecoins, and standards for oversight and quality of reserves.  Finally, he gives Congress the toughest message of all: that they have to actually do something.  “Deciding how U.S. dollar stablecoins should be regulated is a major question that only Congress, not the federal agencies, can address.” As for regulators who would enforce new stablecoin rules, Chervinsky advocates for the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), outlining why neither the SEC nor Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is a good fit.  I have mixed feelings about this entire stablecoin process. While good regulation of any part of crypto would be welcome, it would be a bit maddening if we get reasonable U.S. stablecoin regulation before the SEC gets its act together to establish a disclosure and investing framework for actual crypto assets.  Stablecoins, after all, take advantage of only a tiny part of what crypto can do, while still relying on the old choke point-riddled banking rails. But perhaps that hybrid nature makes them the thin end of a wedge that can open the door for crypto proper just a bit wider.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | FIAT | REGULATION,David Z.

11929179,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527619,1681912359,How to Allow Customers to Pay in Bitcoin,"Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have transformed the way many businesses operate. A growing number of vendors accept Bitcoin payments allowing their customers to use this new payment method. Allowing customers to pay in Bitcoin is not difficult, and any vendor can start doing so by following a few simple steps. You can learn about this fantastic opportunity and become a bitcoin trader through the Bitcoin Prime trading platform that is free and easy to use. Understanding Bitcoin as a Payment Option Before allowing customers to pay in Bitcoin, it is important to understand Bitcoin and how it works. Bitcoin is a virtual currency that provides an alternative to fiat currency. This virtual currency has value. Hence, its growing acceptance. As a business, allowing customers to pay in Bitcoin aligns well with the digital payment trend that is becoming more popular. Besides being a virtual currency, Bitcoin is also a valuable digital asset. By accepting Bitcoin payments, vendors can also benefit from bitcoin trading. Learning about laws or regulations affecting Bitcoin and its use is also essential. Different countries may have various rules on Bitcoin payments. Please understand these regulations to ensure a seamless experience when customers pay in Bitcoin. Allowing Bitcoin Payment To ensure seamless transactions, follow these steps to allow customers to pay with Bitcoin at your business. 1. Do You Need Bitcoin Payments? After understanding Bitcoin and how it works, the next important step is determining whether you need it as an accepted payment option. And this will be important to avert unnecessary outcomes like not having customers willing or ready to pay in Bitcoin. 2. Setting Up Your Crypto Wallet Next, set up your crypto wallet. This virtual wallet enables vendors to accept and hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There are multiple crypto wallet providers online that vendors can use to set up their crypto wallets. With your unique private key, you can access and secure Bitcoin. 3. Enabling Bitcoin Payments After setting up the bitcoin wallet, the next step is to enable Bitcoin payments on your e-commerce website. You can do this by downloading and installing relevant apps or plugins on the e-commerce platform. And this is relatively straightforward. Just ensure that your Bitcoin payments are on a good site. 4. Communicating Appropriately Setting up and enabling Bitcoin payments to allow customers to pay in Bitcoin does not guarantee that the customers will use this option. That is where the communication aspect matters. Like any new product or service, vendors need to communicate with customers letting them know they can use Bitcoin to pay for goods or services. Ensure that your communication is clear and positively influences the customers. And this means providing all relevant information, including explaining to customers how they can pay in Bitcoin and the potential benefits. As more customers know that a vendor accepts Bitcoin payments, they will be more inclined to start using it. Benefits of Allowing Bitcoin Payment Allowing Bitcoin payments is beneficial to a business. Bitcoin is a popular virtual currency with millions of users. And this means that companies have a growing market of Bitcoin users who will prefer paying in Bitcoin. Allowing Bitcoin payments is good for enhancing competitiveness. Virtual currencies and digital payments are becoming more popular and replacing traditional payment options like credit cards or cash. Therefore, businesses that allow customers to use Bitcoin to pay are likely to be more competitive than those that don’t. Take Away As Bitcoin becomes more popular as a digital currency, businesses should start allowing their customers to pay in this virtual currency. And this creates an additional payment alternative that customers find more convenient and beneficial than conventional payment options. Allowing customers to pay in Bitcoin is simple and involves following a few steps.

Bitcoin is a popular virtual currency, otherwise referred to as cryptocurrency. The mysterious entity, Satoshi Nakamoto, is behind Bitcoin’s development and introduction. Today, Bitcoin has millions of users globally. You can mine Bitcoin, buy, or trade via online crypto trading bots like bitcoin up Bitcoin is a virtual currency that forms an alternative to fiat money, and many people use it as a payment for services and items. And this has also resulted in a growing number of businesses accepting Bitcoin payments. Whether you are shopping for essential items or services, paying with Bitcoin has some key benefits. Four Fast and Easy Steps to Pay with Bitcoin Paying with Bitcoin is quite simple and fast. Following the four simple steps below, you can pay for goods or services where Bitcoin is accepted. 1. Open Your Bitcoin Wallet Opening and setting up a Bitcoin wallet is the first thing to do when paying with this cryptocurrency. A Bitcoin wallet acts like the typical wallet for keeping physical money. However, being a virtual wallet means you cannot touch it. You can set up your Bitcoin wallet with your preferred Bitcoin wallet provider online, such as Binance. 2. Obtain Bitcoin After setting up your Bitcoin wallet, the next step is to obtain Bitcoin. And this ensures that you have some Bitcoins in your wallet to use for payments. There are different ways you can acquire Bitcoin. 3. Finding Out Whether Vendor Accepts Bitcoin You will need to find out whether a particular vendor accepts Bitcoin payments. It is important to note that while the number of vendors accepting Bitcoin continues to grow, some still need to take it as a form of payment. You can quickly establish whether a vendor accepts Bitcoin by going to their website or finding a list of vendors that do so online. 4. Make Payment The final step in paying with Bitcoin is making the payment. And this involves getting the vendor’s Bitcoin address, inserting it in the relevant field in your Bitcoin wallet, typing the amount of Bitcoin to send, and confirming payment. The vendor will receive the Bitcoin payment almost immediately. Benefits of Bitcoin Payment Among the main benefits of using Bitcoin to pay for goods or services is the control it gives the user. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency meaning that no government or single entity controls it. With traditional fiat currency, the government, through the central bank, has significant control denying you the freedom to transact the way you desire. Additionally, Bitcoin offers privacy and anonymity to users. Bitcoin protects your identity, which is essential to prevent hacking. Remaining anonymous when making Bitcoin payments also boosts the trust in the cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology. Moreover, Bitcoin payments are far much cheaper than other payment alternatives. Using online payment platforms like PayPal or a credit card attracts fees that can be too costly. However, Bitcoin payments do not have such costs, making them cheaper and more convenient. Conclusion Bitcoin has become a popular means of payment for goods and services. Many vendors are now accepting Bitcoin making it convenient to pay with Bitcoin instead of fiat money, PayPal, or credit card. Paying is very simple and easy, as outlined above. With the convenience of Bitcoin payment, including the benefits, why don’t you try it the next time you want to pay for some items or services?

11927807,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527609,1681911217,Can Using Bitcoin Take You to Jail?,"Since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, its popularity has grown significantly. Currently, Bitcoin has millions of users ranging from individuals to businesses. This popularity has primarily been positive thanks to the growth in Bitcoin’s value over time. However, there are also negative stories and concerns about Bitcoin, showing that it could take one to jail. You can also invest in Bitcoin by trading in it. You can register and start purchasing and selling Bitcoin via the Immediate Edge app. Bitcoin is a digital currency and asset. You can use Bitcoin to pay for daily purchases in different businesses that accept it. Is Bitcoin Legal? Before exploring the issue of how Bitcoin could take you to jail, it is prudent to understand its legal status. People go to prison for engaging in illegal activities and items such as narcotics. For instance, you can go to jail for possessing illegal drugs or weapons. You can also go to jail for having and using counterfeit money. Bitcoin is inherently legal, although many countries and states are yet to accept it as legal tender. China is one country that has banned Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Other countries like the US are coming up with various laws and regulations on cryptocurrencies affecting Bitcoin usage. However, even in countries where Bitcoin is not treated or accepted as legal currency, having and using Bitcoin does not mean that you can go to jail. In the US and many other countries, people and businesses are using Bitcoin because it is not unlawful. Many companies in the US are now accepting Bitcoin payments. So using Bitcoin may not take you to jail if you use it legally or per government regulations on cryptocurrency use, including paying crypto taxes. But there are several ways that Bitcoin can land you in prison, as espoused below. Illegal Activities Using Bitcoin Bitcoin can take you to jail if you use it for criminal activities. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin’s blockchain makes it attractive to criminals who may hide their traces by using Bitcoin. Some illegal activities that can attract jail terms with Bitcoin include money laundering, drug trafficking, and human trafficking. The Silk Road case is one example of how Bitcoin can lead one to jail. In this case that attracted significant media attention, criminals used the dark web to conduct illegal transactions with Bitcoin, including money laundering and drug trafficking. Some of the individuals that were found guilty went to jail. Tax Evasion Bitcoin can take you to jail by using it to evade taxes. Tax evasion is a financial crime that can attract imprisonment and other penalties. If you hide your investments and other legally taxable activities in Bitcoin, the relevant government agencies could catch up with you and put you in prison for it. Operating Unlicensed Crypto Exchanges Bitcoin can also take you to jail if you operate a crypto exchange without licensing and following relevant regulations. Crypto exchanges are places where people buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies. Although not all countries treat Bitcoin as legal currency, they all require some form of licensing for the crypto exchanges. Crypto exchanges are businesses and have to operate within the relevant legal framework. Final Thought Bitcoin is inherently legal, and owning or using it may not take you to jail. However, engaging in criminal activities, evading tax, and operating unlicensed crypto exchanges will land you in jail. Different countries are now coming up with crypto laws and regulations. Learning about these laws and regulations is vital to avoid going to jail for breaking them.

42387666,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQnFVl,1681910427,Prosecutors Seek 7-Year Prison Sentence for Reggie Fowler in Crypto Shadow Bank Case,"U.S. prosecutors have asked a court to sentence Reggie Fowler, a former professional football player who became an entrepreneur, to at least seven years in prison in the case involving Crypto Capital Corp., the shadow bank that lost hundreds of millions of exchange platform Bitfinex's money.  Fowler, the alleged operator of Crypto Capital Corp., pleaded guilty to charges of bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy last April – around two years after rejecting a plea deal.  Court documents filed on Wednesday show prosecutors requesting a sentence of at least seven years in prison – reduced from the typical recommended 15-20 years for similar crimes – and an order of forfeiture upward of $740 million.  ""Reginald Fowler has committed serious crimes. Only a significant period of incarceration, of at least 84 months’ imprisonment, could reflect that seriousness, promote respect for the law, and afford adequate deterrence,"" the court document said.  Prosecutors also ask the court to issue an order of restitution amounting to $53 million on behalf of the Alliance of American Football, which they say was ""a victim of Fowler’s wire fraud.""  “I have longstanding admiration for the prosecutors seeking a seven-year sentence, but their request is seven years too long. The factors of the controlling statutory sentencing statutes and the very recent amendments to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines all cry out for a non-custodial sentence for this remarkable man who has overcome obstacles that are perhaps even more extraordinary than are the achievements that he has gained throughout the last six decades of his life. We remain confident that the Court will agree that Reggie Fowler does not belong in prison,"" Fowler's attorney, Edward Sapone of Sapone & Petrillo, LLP, said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk.

42411958,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhjxg,1681909885,Onramp Invest Teams Up With CoinDesk Indices to Deliver Leading Crypto Indices,"CoinDesk Indices,the underlying index provider for this product launch, sat down with Eric Ervin, CEO of Onramp Invest, to discuss how advisors can now access comprehensive crypto indices on Onramp’s Marketplace.  What follows is an interview with Eric Ervin, CEO of Onramp Invest. The interview was conducted by CoinDesk Indices and is not associated with CoinDesk editorial.  1. What is your view on where the crypto industry is heading to?  There’s perhaps no industry more exciting than digital assets right now. We’re still in the nascent phase of its growth, and even at this stage, this asset class is already doing so much to change the world of finance for the better. Other industries, such as real estate, gaming and entertainment, are also in early stages of major shifts driven by digital assets and blockchain. We’re starting to see tokenization bring out more opportunities for investors by applying blockchain’s efficiency and borderless potential to existing traditional market methods. With the market currently moving in a more positive direction and the emergence of new regulatory frameworks aimed at protecting investors, we believe cryptocurrencies are going to find even more ways to reach their full potential.  2. You’ve mentioned the connection between The Great Wealth Transfer and what it means for alternative investments like cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. How do you think the next generation of inheriting investors see the future of blockchain?  The millennial generation and younger are the most educated investor group that we've ever seen; in fact, they are the most educated generation in history. They want to try new things, and they're about to inherit trillions of dollars worth of wealth. They are curious, and even though cryptocurrencies give them more opportunities to invest independently, there is evidence that they want blockchain investing guidance from advisors; as their wealth grows, it is only natural to assume they will seek additional help. We think we're going to see a kind of evolution into a hybrid management approach where advisors can support, manage, and advise on client assets while still allowing them to maintain autonomy and direct input on strategy. This generation doesn’t want to set it and forget it—they’re intrigued by innovation and want to be involved in it.  3. Why do you feel crypto indices are so critical for advisors? When you’re considering partners to work with in the indices space, what do you look for?  The digital asset space is moving quickly, and the number of cryptocurrencies available to follow can be overwhelming for anyone—particularly for advisors who are managing traditional assets, as well. The average advisor will probably only be looking to allocate 3-10% of a client’s portfolio to digital assets. They don’t want to spend 90% of their time doing research. Digital asset indices allow advisors to utilize leading market research from top firms that are on the pulse of the market and take some of the more nuanced guesswork out of investing by creating a diversified exposure. We are very fortunate to be able to partner with innovative firms like CoinDesk Indices (CDI) which specializes in cutting edge, extensive market and analytical research. We also prioritize partnering with firms that can show a consistent track record and put an emphasis on compliance in an evolving regulatory space.  4. Tell us about the offering and the underlying indices.  By partnering with CDI, Onramp can provide advisors with a wider range of options so that these advisors can create models aligned with their clients’ desired exposures. The indices now available on Onramp’s flexible platform include CoinDesk Market Select Index (CMIS), CoinDesk DeFi Select Index (DFX) and CoinDesk Currency Select Index (CCYS).  CDI's indices are designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of some of the largest and most liquid digital assets that meet certain trading and custody requirements. The indices are based on the Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS), with each index consisting of different digital assets.  As of April 4, 2023:  DFX consists of the following assets: Aave (AAVE), BCurve DAO Token (CRV), Synthetix (SNX) and Maker (MKR).  CCYS consists of the following assets: Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Stellar (XLM), Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Quant (QNT).  CMIS includes 27 different constituents within 5 of CDI's crypto sector indices, offering broad market access while also having filters and screens in place for liquidity.  5.

42412257,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3t1o,1681907825,EU’s Crypto Licensing Regime Set for Approval as Lawmakers Signal Support,"European Union lawmakers from multiple parties signaled continuing support for the bloc’s landmark Markets in Crypto Assets regulation in a Wednesday debate, suggesting the licensing law known as MiCA will easily be approved in a vote scheduled for Thursday.  MiCA, whose main political outlines were agreed upon last year, would allow crypto exchanges and digital-wallet companies to offer regulated services across the bloc and requires stablecoin issuers to hold sufficient reserves.  Speakers from the parliament’s biggest groupings – the European People’s Party, Socialists and Democrats, Renew Europe and European Conservatives and Reformists – welcomed the proposals. Assuming all those parties’ members vote accordingly, the law seems set to comfortably gain the majority needed for the legislation to pass.  “Europe can be proud of the step we're taking today,” Lídia Pereira of the center-right EPP, which constitutes the biggest political grouping in the European Parliament, told fellow lawmakers.  “As we've seen in recent months, stringent rules and supervision are very much needed,” the European Commission’s Mairead McGuinness said, citing the collapse of crypto companies FTX, Celsius Network and Voyager Digital and of the terraUSD stablecoin, and referring to provisions intended to protect consumers, prevent market abuse and curb money laundering.  MiCA should “restore the trust that was damaged by the FTX case” and bring stability to the sector, said Stefan Berger, the German center-right lawmaker who led the parliament’s negotiations on the law, adding that it will put the EU “at the forefront of the token economy.”  Lawmakers also suggested support for a separate but controversial anti-money-laundering measure known as transfer-of-funds rules, which require crypto providers to gather details of their users’ identity.  Agreement on the laws marks “the end of the ‘Wild West' era for the unregulated world of crypto assets,” said the Green grouping’s Ernest Urtasun, adding that the sector had “provided a safe haven for fraudsters and international criminal networks.”  The deal struck by negotiators for the parliament and the EU’s Council, representing member states, must be formally rubber-stamped by both institutions before the measures pass into law, a step that has been hampered by administrative delays in completing and translating the text.  MiCA rules will take effect 12 to 18 months after the legislation is published in the bloc’s Official Journal, which is likely to happen in June – potentially making the EU the first major jurisdiction with a wide-reaching crypto law.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin slid more than 3% to below $30,000 on Wednesday morning. While the sell-off didn’t appear to stem from any immediate fundamental reason, an unexpectedly high U.K. March inflation figure of more than 10% may have influenced market sentiment. Liquidations may have also played a role. “Bitcoin saw some decent liquidations on Binance, which dropped as a consequence of long rekts being washed out early this morning,” said Laurent Kssis, a crypto trading adviser at CEC Capital. There was close to $100 million in liquidations, according to Kssis, who added that many investors are buying at under $29,200. “This was clearly an opportunity for many investors who had anticipated the drop to get back in at lower levels,"" he said.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler refused to say whether ether is a security during a nearly five-hour hearing before the House Financial Services Committee Tuesday. Gensler fended off questions about whether his agency was pushing too hard on proposed rules and providing too little time for public feedback on those rules and about how the SEC was approaching crypto companies that want to operate in the U.S.  Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX's plan to restart its operations has drawn interest from venture-capital firm Tribe Capital, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday. Tribe, whose portfolio included FTX ahead of the exchange's collapse in November, is considering leading a $250 million fundraising round, with a $100 million commitment, according to the report. A source told Bloomberg that Tribe Capital co-founder Arjun Sethi met with FTX’s official committee of unsecured creditors in January to go over an informal proposal. ""The committee is working with the debtors to evaluate all options to reboot or sell the FTX exchanges and create value for creditors,"" FTX creditors' committee tweeted on Tuesday, adding that there isn't a set timeline for a reboot or sale at this time.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of bitcoin held by wallets associated with miners since February.  The miner balance declined by about 800 BTC last week, a sign those responsible for minting coins are beginning to run down their coin stash again.  The miner selling, however, accounts for less than 1% of bitcoin's average daily trading volume of over $20 billion, suggesting a negligible bearish impact on the cryptocurrency's price.

The companies are looking to make it easier for institutions to hold digital assets and bolster investor confidence in the market. The arrangement allows customers to access the more than 1,800 tokens supported by Ledger, broadening their crypto investment options without having to maintain their own private keys, while segregating clients’ funds and reducing counterparty risks.  Institutional investors have become increasingly mindful of complying with crypto regulations amid a regulatory crackdown on the digital-assets industry in the U.S. In the first few months of 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission has levied penalties, including fines, against more than a dozen crypto trading and lending firms.  As part of the deal, Etana is able to act as a settlement party to the counterparties in a given transaction, enabling them to trade digital assets without putting up their money to one another directly, eliminating the risk of deals falling through.  ""It essentially prevents the client from doing the Hokey Pokey, or putting his money in and taking it out before a trade actually settles, leaving the exchange with the settlement risk,” Etana CEO Brandon Russell told CoinDesk.

42412245,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3svG,1681905600,Crypto Protocol Fetch.ai Offering AI Trading Tools for Decentralized Exchanges,"Fetch.ai, which develops artificial intelligence (AI) tools for crypto, is rolling out a set of enhanced trading products for decentralized exchanges (DEX).  The Cambridge, U.K.-based firm wants to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions between decentralized finance (DeFi) users using AI-powered ""agents"" to execute trades based on user-defined parameters, it said Wednesday. It will roll out the suite of trading tools later this quarter.  ""Users submit their orders to an agent, which then puts it in escrow or an atomic transaction while it works out where it can do the order matching,"" CEO Humayun Sheikh said in an interview. ""The ability of the platform to find and create liquidity is where the platform comes into itself, whereby agents work together to create those decentralized order books.""  The absence of a liquidity pool, the mechanism usually employed by DEXs to facilitate quick and efficient trading, means there is no trove of coins for hackers to target.  By focusing on individual agents, Fetch.ai is attempting to overcome the risk that the smart contract at the heart of a DEX is exploited, or that the developer promoting a new project disappears with users' money in what's known as a rug pull. The agents employ their own smart contracts to carry out users' instructions.  ""A hacker would have to hack every single agent. They couldn't just hack the central smart contract because there isn't one,"" Sheikh said.  As of last month, nearly $120 million in crypto had been stolen in 2023 across 19 different breaches, according to analytics firm Crystal Blockchain, with most involving attacks on vulnerabilities in the code and design of decentralized protocols.  Not only is this directly damaging to the victims of these thefts, but it is detrimental to the confidence and the potential for further adoption of DeFi, something Fetch.ai is aiming to tackle with its alternative paradigm for how the ecosystem can operate.

42412238,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3srW,1681904538,Hong Kong Court Declares Crypto as Property in Case Involving Defunct Gatecoin,"A Hong Kong court has recognized crypto as property ""capable of being held on trust"" in a case involving shuttered crypto exchange Gatecoin, according to a court document reviewed by CoinDesk.  Global law firm Hogan Lovells first reported on the judgment on Wednesday.  Justice Linda Chan, who presided over the case, said Hong Kong, in line with other common law jurisdictions, defines ""property"" broadly ""intended to have a wide meaning.""  There have been similar rulings in Mainland China, while the U.S. Internal Revenue Service treats crypto as property for tax purposes. A government-funded law commission in the U.K. found crypto can be classified as a new type of property under existing laws in England and Wales.  In 2019, Hong Kong-based crypto exchange Gatecoin announced it will shut down and start liquidation following an attempt to recover disputed funds from a former payment services provider.  Liquidators sought directions from the court on whether the crypto held by Gatecoin should be treated as property held on trust or ""if no trust existed, the digital assets should be made available to the general body of creditors,"" according to the Hogan Lovells report. The exchange held up to 140 million Hong Kong dollars ($17.8 million) in crypto as of last October, the report said.  ""While the court determined that cryptocurrencies are capable of forming the subject matter of a trust more generally, on the facts in this particular case it found that a trust had not been established,"" the report said.  The 2018 terms and conditions of the exchange platform showed ""no certainty of intention to create a trust over the cryptocurrencies held by Gatecoin,"" the judgment said.  A ruling would give Hong Kong liquidators ""greater clarity"" on how crypto assets held by companies should be treated in wind-down procedures, Hogan Lovells said.  Hong Kong has been pushing for clearer regulations for the crypto sector. Brokerage firm Bernstein said earlier this year that Hong Kong's approach to regulating crypto could attract capital to the jurisdiction at a time of global regulatory uncertainty.  CoinDesk has reached out to Hogan Lovells for comment.

42410811,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrhl4,1681902000,"CoinDesk Winds Down Ethereum Validator ‘Zelda,’ and We Now Wait to Get Money Back","As loyal Valid Points readers recall, CoinDesk set up its own Ethereum validator, fondly nicknamed “Zelda,” in 2020 to witness firsthand the blockchain’s landmark shift to an energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus mechanism from its original proof-of-work – the same one used by Bitcoin. The goal was to learn, and to report.  That transition was effectively completed last week, when Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade (aka Shapella) went live, enabling the first-ever withdrawals from the blockchain’s staking mechanism.  In keeping with the original plan, we took the steps needed to wind down our validator and redeem our initial deposit of 32 ether (ETH) – worth about $15,000 back in 2020 – along with the extra ETH that Zelda was awarded over time for helping to keep the blockchain secure and running smoothly.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  It’s been a learning experience, and one of the key lessons was discovering how long it can take for validators to withdraw their ETH when the exit queue gets backed up. According to CoinDesk Director of Engineering C. Spencer Beggs, we could be looking at roughly a week before our withdrawal request is successfully processed and the 32 ETH hits our wallet.  Another thing we’ve learned, along with investors and traders in digital-asset markets, is that the Shanghai upgrade proved to be quite bullish for the price of ether; it wasn’t the vicious sell-off that some analysts had warned would come. It was never our intent to speculate on the price of ETH, but after a rally in the second-largest cryptocurrency to an 11-month high above $2,100, our original principal is now worth nearly $70,000.  CoinDesk's validator rewards during the roughly 30-month experiment add up to 3.65618 ETH (about $7,600), and as promised we are planning to donate these profits to charity.  Now that our validator project is concluding, it is also time to say goodbye to Valid Points, which was launched a few years ago to focus exclusively on Ethereum and the wider array of projects connected to it. But don’t worry – the newsletter isn’t going away. Next week, Valid Points officially becomes The Protocol, which will focus on blockchain and crypto tech more broadly. You, reader, don’t have to do a thing; your existing subscription will carry over.  We wish to thank former CoinDesk reporters Christine Kim and Will Foxley for having the foresight (and fortitude) to undertake this project and launch Valid Points back in 2020, along with all the other journalists who have contributed to the newsletter over the years. And a heroic shout-out goes to Beggs, who figured out how to do all of this and oversaw the technical aspects so competently.  The following is a detailed walk-through of the steps that Beggs took to wind down our Ethereum validator and redeem our staked ether from the blockchain.  The validator-tracking app Beaconcha.in provided the snapshot below of our validator’s status at the start of the process. (The yellow triangle with the exclamation mark shows that the validator had not yet updated its withdrawal keys.)  Beggs took the steps to exit on Friday, April 14, two days after the Shanghai upgrade successfully went through. (Yes, we admit we attended the watch parties.)  He used the Ethereum “staking deposit CLI” – the official management service for generating the cryptographic keys used on the proof-of-stake blockchain – to generate a signed message known as, “BLSToExecutionChange.” This message is a command that informs the blockchain that we wanted to update our validator’s withdrawal address, which hadn’t been possible prior to the Shanghai upgrade.  We then broadcast that message to our beacon node.  “I signed the message and sent it to our beacon, and the beacon sent it to the blockchain,” Beggs said.  Based on the guidance in this Ethereum Foundation FAQ on staking withdrawals, Beggs expected this step to take two to three days:  But after just an hour, there was the status update below from Beaconcha.in; it had already gone through:  With the withdrawal credential successfully updated, Beggs logged in to our server, using the program Lighthouse, which runs both our validator and beacon clients, and issued the request to exit.  “You just type a command,” he said.  We received the following response from the server:  There’s a lot of info in that screen, but a crucial bit is in those last few visible lines – estimating that our exit would be processed on Ethereum blockchain epoch 196,690, and that we would be able to withdraw at epoch 196,946. (At the time, we were at epoch 194,506.)  The script read: “Exit epoch in approximately 838,656 secs.”  “I did the math to convert that to days,” Beggs said. It worked out to about 9.7 days.  Currently the Ethereum blockchain is at epoch 195,372, and Beaconcha.in now estimates that the exit will be processed on April 24, 4:16 p.m. UTC, and the withdrawal on April 25, 7:34 p.m. UTC.  In the meantime, according to Beggs, “Zelda’s still validating and attesting.” Working till the very end.  Epilogue  Asked for any lessons learned in the winding down, Beggs says he’s glad (or lucky) that he took detailed notes on the project from the very beginning.  “I was sweating bullets there for a second because I thought I did something very wrong, because when I tried to generate the ‘BLSToExecutionChange’ message, my keys and my previous withdraw credentials didn’t match,” Beggs recalled.  He took a look back at his own documentation on the project to remind himself how to verify the keys – by regenerating them using our original seed phrase and validator index. With the clue (from his two-years-earlier self), he was able to figure it out.  “Finally it came out and generated the right way,” Beggs said in a Zoom interview. “I’m glad I wrote everything down.”  Sage D.

11920251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527549,1681901441,Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Binance Whale Games And More,"The Bitcoin price fell from over $30,000 to a new local low of $29,032 in the early morning hours (4:00 am EST) today. The initial 3.5% price drop happened within just 20 minutes. While the sell-off does not seem to have a fundamental reason, two factors are currently coming into focus for the sudden price drop. These are a massive sale of 16,000 BTC worth around $467 million on Binance and the subsequent cascade of liquidations. The Reasons For The Bitcoin Plunge Analyst @52Skew presumably shared the initial trigger for the sudden drop in Bitcoin price via Twitter. The trader revealed that 16,000 Bitcoin were sold off from Binance spot at the market price, while “pretty typical” amounts were sold off on other spot exchanges. “Interesting selloff here,” the analyst remarked in reference to possible activity by whales. He further noted that there were some signals ahead of the selloff, with large spot & market makers selling off the price. He further speculates: Either a new local low here if $29K is held & no FUD is dropped later. However, 16K BTC is unusual size to be market sold solely from Binance spot. Usually this kind of sale happens before bad news comes out. If a nothing burger event; could see an omega short squeeze. Indicators investors should look out for, according to @52Skew, are negative funding “across the board”, open interest, which indicates a large interest in shorts, and an elevated spot buying volume. Related Reading: Sell Bitcoin For $45,000 In May And Go Away If History Is Guide After the huge sell-off, a so-called long squeeze on the futures market occurred.

On March 23, as a result of the long squeeze ($183.7 million), Bitcoin fell from $28,300 to just under $27,000, and it took the market only one day to recover the entire loss. Analyst @DaanCrypto states that this dump was necessary, to flush out all over-leveraged long positions in BTC, ETH and other altcoins. “Funding rates seem mostly reset already,” the analyst concludes. Related Reading: Not So Fast: Bitcoin Strength Fails To Breach This Key Bullish Level Michaël van de Poppe, founder of Eight Global, agrees. “It’s just a liquidation cascade,” writes the analyst, who further advises: ‘Should you get into #altcoins and positions?’ Well, this drawdown is your chance. Bitcoin corrects, cascade of liquidity being taken on altcoins and deep wicks providing significant opportunities. Nothing major has changed, just a correction. At press time, the Bitcoin price was trading at a key support level, changing hands for $29,166.

42412260,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl3t5Y,1681898582,Institutions Flock to Ether After Shapella Upgrade,"Ethereum implemented the highly anticipated Shapella hard fork, also known as the Shanghai upgrade, on April 12, reducing the risk of staking the blockchain's native token, ether (ETH), by allowing withdrawals of locked coins at will. The pivotal event has galvanized institutional interest in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value.  Since April 10, the number of active, or open, ether futures contracts trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has risen 39% to 6,248, according to official data. In U.S. dollar terms, open interest has increased by over 70% to $633 million. The tally reached a 12-month high of $675 million on Friday, Coinglass data show. Each contract has a value of 50 ETH and is quoted in US dollars per 1 ether.  Institutions typically prefer regulated products like CME futures that allow them to take exposure to digital assets without owning them. As such, CME futures tied to ether and bitcoin are widely considered a proxy for institutional activity.  ""The CME's market share has grown as institutions have been forced to evaluate the credit exposure underlying their collateral on crypto native exchanges,"" said Jeff Anderson, a crypto trader and the former chief investment officer at Folkvang Trading. ""The activity surrounding Shapella has laid this bare with open interest at 12-month highs.""  Noelle Acheson, the author of the popular Crypto is Macro Now newsletter, voiced a similar opinion.  ""The past few days have seen a strong inflow of institutional interest into ETH futures,"" Acheson said. ""USD open interest is now at its highest since March 2022, and just before the weekend, ETH futures open interest on the CME jumped over 80% in USD terms,"" Acheson said.  An increase in open interest alongside a price rise represents an influx of new money into the market and confirms the uptrend. Ether's price has risen 8% since the Shapella hard fork, CoinDesk data show.  ""ETH is definitely experiencing idiosyncratic flows at the moment,"" Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, said. ""BTC OI is down 1.5% since April 10, whereas ETH OI is up 38.7% in the same period,"" referring to open interest.  ""We have been seeing similar flows in exchange-traded products (ETP). BTC ETPs saw net outflows of 1.52% from April 10 to April 18 while ETH has seen net inflows of 0.77% in the same period,"" Lunde added.  The futures basis, or the spread between prices in futures and spot markets, has widened, with the annualized rolling three-month premium doubling to over 4%. The combination of rising open interest and widening basis suggests the leverage has been allocated to the bullish side.  A rising premium often draws carry traders to the market. Carry trading involves setting up a market-neutral strategy by selling futures and simultaneously buying the underlying asset in the spot market to pocket the price differential between the two markets.  ""The attractive basis has brought more traders to market,"" Anderson said.  Activity on other exchanges has also picked up pace post-Shapella, suggesting institutions are not the only ones flocking to the market right now.  ""Open interest has also been hitting record highs on Deribit, so it may not be conclusive evidence of institutional buying,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  The global ETH futures open interest, excluding CME, has increased by almost 22% to $6.62 billion, Coinglass data show. Open interest in Deribit-listed ETH futures has jumped 30% to $750 million, reaching the highest since the May 2021 record high of $778.6 million.  ""Post the Shapella upgrade, unstaking withdrawals have been orderly and well-absorbed by the market and we are also seeing an uptick in staking from ETH holders. As ETH continues to be deflationary post-Merge and with the added attraction of staking yields which can be freely unstaked, we are seeing more bullish interest on ETH,"" Lo said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | FORKS,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/04/19/institutions-flock-to-ether-after-shapella-upgrade,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a456e57471c498e4087715509d2f2c2e7407f67f-2911x983.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

11917892,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=527502,1681893905,"Sell Bitcoin For $45,000 In May And Go Away If History Is Guide","K33 Research, formerly known as Arcane Research, has published a report which suggests Bitcoin investors should follow the old Wall Street adage “Sell in May and go away.” The saying suggests that investors should sell their stocks in the summer and buy them back at the end of the summer to avoid a seasonal decline in the stock market. In their Bitcoin-related report, senior analyst Vetle Lunde writes that the current drawdown and recovery cycle is strikingly similar to the pattern of the 2018-19 bear market in terms of length and trajectory. If history repeats itself, Bitcoin could peak at $45,000 in as little as one month, around May 20, 2023, according to the analyst. Similarities Of The Current Bitcoin Rally To 2018 The research is based on an analysis using fractals of previous drawdowns and previous lows. “While no one should expect a 1:1 mirroring of the current drawdown to previous drawdowns, the resemblance to the 2018 drawdown is staggering,” writes Lunde, who shared the chart below. The analyst found similarities in both the duration from peak to bottom and the recovery path. The lows of the current cycle and the 2018 bear market cycle lasted both about 370 days. The return from peak to bottom is also strikingly similar. After 510 days, it was 60% in both cycles. The only minor difference is that the decline from peak to bottom in 2018 was slightly higher at 84% than in 2022, when BTC bottomed at 78% from the all-time high. Related Reading: Glassnode: 8/8 Bitcoin On-Chain Indicators Confirm Recovery From Bear The conclusion that Bitcoin will reach its local high around May 20, 2023 comes from the fact that in 2018, the bear market rally peaked 556 days after the 2017 high, on June 29, 2019, with a drawdown of 34% from the high. Lunde therefore predicts: While history is far from likely to repeat in a similar fashion if the fractal were to continue – BTC would peak around May 20 at $45,000. As for the reasons for the strong similarities, Lunde has no “satisfactory” explanation. The best explanation, according to Lunde, is the pragmatic behavior of long-term holders of Bitcoin, who even after the sharp drawdown prove their “diamond hands”, meaning they do not sell, and instead use the phase to accumulate. Related Reading: Yield Curve Reaches Historic Low, What It Means For Bitcoin Moreover, according to Lunde, the current rally has all the hallmarks of a “hated” rally – “a rally where holders feel underexposed after a highly traumatic year, where investors are de-risked in anticipation of further downside,” as Lunde writes, finding another similarity in this: The hated rally of 2019 ended with a significant blow-off top before BTC resumed trading at a 40-60% drawdown from its 2017 ATH. Remarkably, K33 Research is not the only analytics firm predicting a local high for Bitcoin in the mid $40,000s. Glassnode co-founders Jan Happel and Yann Allemann write in their latest newsletter that the market is currently showing extreme strength, which is why the next big target is $35,000 before $47,000. “This is still the outlook just as we expect much higher prices into late Q2 and Q3,” write the analysts, who focus their attention primarily on macro data and the dollar index (DXY). The latter, according to the Glassnode co-founders, will fall into the 91-93 range before the end of the year, which would be extremely bullish for Bitcoin. At press time, the Bitcoin price traded at $29,340.

Further declines took it as low as $29,000, CoinDesk data shows.  While the sell-off didn't appear to stem from any fundamental reason immediately, an unusually large sell order on crypto exchange Binance and an unexpectedly high U.K. March inflation figure of more than 10% may have influenced market sentiment.  Also in the mix: a so-called long squeeze. More than $25 million in bitcoin futures were liquidated. Longs, or bets on rising prices, made 98% of the positions.  ""The hotter-than-expected U.K. CPI may have weighed over risk assets, including BTC. But the gravity of the reaction has been far, far more severe than in other asset classes,"" Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, told CoinDesk, using the acronym for consumer price index.  ""Seems to be more of a leverage washout. Binance OI in BTCUSDT perps fell 5.1% in 15 minutes, effects more severe in ETH with larger liquidation volume than BTC,"" Lunde said, referring to open interest, or the total number of contracts in the futures market, and also to perpetual futures contracts.  Prominent pseudonymous crypto Twitter trader @52kskew pointed out that a 16,000 bitcoin sell order, worth over $467 million at current prices, preceded the dump, which may have initiated the long squeeze.  ""16K BTC is unusual size to be market sold solely from Binance spot usually the kind of sale happens before bad news comes out,"" @52kskew opined in a follow-up tweet.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of their initial margin. It happens when the investor is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position, meaning they don't have sufficient funds to keep the trade open.  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  The slide led to a sell-off in the broader crypto market, with ether (ETH), polygon (MATIC) and dogecoin (DOGE) all falling by about 5% in the past 24 hours and solana (SOL) losing nearly 9%.

Over the course of the marathon hearing, Gensler fended off questions about whether his agency was pushing too hard on proposed rules, providing too little time for public feedback on these rules, how it was approaching crypto companies hoping to operate in the U.S. and a host of noncrypto questions, including proposed disclosure requirements around climate change and audit trails.  Gensler's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday was his first since the current Congress took over, and indeed his first in over a year.  ""Congress must provide clear rules of the road to the digital asset ecosystem because the regulators cannot agree,"" Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) said in his opening statement.

One of the most contentious points in the hearing came early on, when McHenry asked Gensler to say if he thought ether was a security.  ""Back in 2018, then-SEC Corporation Finance Director Bill Hinman said he believed ether was not a security,"" McHenry said. ""Last month [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] Chair [Rostin] Behnam expressed his view that ether is a commodity. The State Attorney General of New York asserted in a court filing last month that ether is a security. Clearly an asset cannot be both a commodity and a security. Do you agree?""  ""It depends on the facts and the law,"" Gensler said repeatedly during the line of questioning, refusing to say yes or no.  Joshua Ashley Klayman, head of Fintech and head of Blockchain and Digital Assets at Linklaters, argued after the hearing that this was a positive sign for the industry that Gensler didn't immediately just say ether was a security, or say that ""everything other than bitcoin"" was a security.  ""This was the best we could possibly hope for, and it gives some cover to not just ETH but also other cryptocurrencies,"" she said.  Regulatory clarity  Gensler's responsiveness – or perceived lack of responsiveness – to congressional inquiries outside of the hearing came up during Tuesday's questioning.  Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) asked Gensler if the SEC would provide its internal staff memo recommending an enforcement action against the FTX exchange and its one-time CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  ""You're responding to our FTX request solely with publicly available documents ... you didn't give us anything surrounding the charges filed against Sam Bankman-Fried,"" Huizenga said.  Gensler said investigative documents are intended to be confidential, with Huizenga responding he would follow up on the matter.  A number of lawmakers questioned Gensler about a perceived lack of regulatory clarity for crypto companies.  Gensler told Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) that companies needed to ""come in and comply and register to protect the investing public.""  Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) and McHenry said the regulator has not provided the clarity needed by the industry to actually do so. Davidson pointed to Gensler's lack of a definitive answer on whether ether is a security as one example.  Congressman Stephen Lynch (D-Fla.) said there is indeed ""a fair amount of guidance and clarity,"" though ""it's just not clarity that the crypto industry wants,"" pointing to the SEC's enforcement actions and recent guidance, and joint statements by various federal regulators.  ""My friends on the other side of the aisle seem to be bemoaning a lack of regulatory clarity, and then in the same breath they criticize the SEC's rule-making efforts, which arguably would provide that clarity that they desire,"" Lynch said.

The position is not large enough to distort prices but it does present a sentiment risk in a down cycle, Bernstein said in a research report Wednesday.  The business analytics software company is the largest corporate holder of bitcoin as a balance sheet treasury asset, owning around 140,000 BTC at an average cost of $29,800. The stash is worth about $4 billion at current prices, the report said.  The company has about $2.2 billion in debt, with repayments due in 2025 and beyond. It has pledged 15,000 of its bitcoins, Bernstein said.  “High BTC prices mean a stronger balance sheet, higher stock prices and easier debt repayment without selling its BTC holdings,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  MicroStrategy holds around 0.7% of total bitcoin in circulation, representing about 20% of daily average traded volume in spot markets, the note said.  At those levels, MicroStrategy does not “necessarily pose a concentration risk” even if trading volumes fell during a bear market, though it may affect market sentiment.  “The potential liquidation of MicroStrategy’s BTC during bear markets creates an overhang for BTC in a down cycle,” it said.

The Bank of England ran ""Project Meridian"" through the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) London innovation hub to build a prototype that could potentially speed up and reduce costs of transactions in central bank Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) systems.  The project used DLT to link the central bank’s RTGS system ""with other financial market infrastructures and ledgers automatically orchestrating the exchange in ownership of funds and assets in a resilient and secure way,"" according to a statement issued by BIS, which groups the world's central banks.  DLT systems that help keep records of and verify crypto transactions have inspired innovation in traditional finance, with banks around the world exploring how the technology could potentially improve the efficiency of interbank transactions or even power digital versions of sovereign currencies. However, a senior official at the Bank of England warned lawmakers in February that DLT may be too clunky to power a central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Meridian is one of several projects by the BIS Innovation Hub dedicated to examining new developments in fintech, from decentralized finance to CBDC systems.  The project tested scenarios where funds were transferred from buyer to seller only if a corresponding asset on a real estate registry moved simultaneously in the opposite direction. But the prototype can be applied other registries and other assets, including equities and bonds, according to the report.  ""Applying the prototype to other asset classes, such as foreign exchange, was a principle design consideration,"" the statement said.  Although the project has demonstrated that synchronized settlements are possible with commercial bank reserves kept with the central bank, implementation of such systems require ""policy, regulatory and legal"" considerations, the report said.

Sandwich bots are front-running punters of newly issued tokens such as pepe (PEPE) and chad (CHAD) – meme coins with no intrinsic value that caught wind of Crypto Twitter degens almost overnight as the tokens zooted over 10,000%.  A sandwich attack, traps a user's transaction between two transactions, which is then further manipulated to gain profits. This is done by front-running the victim's trade by buying the same asset, and then selling tokens to the victim in the same trade for a slightly higher price.  Sandwich attackers aren’t typically a form of exploit but are looked upon in crypto circles as a type of predatory behavior, which skims value from users, leads to a spike in gas fees and doesn’t benefit either the network or the user.  The victim might not notice it, but for sandwich bots the gains can run into millions of dollars as they target thousands of wallets and skim a few dollars each time.  A wallet named “Jaredfromsubway.eth,” a likely nod to the popular sandwich chain, has spent over $2 million in the past week on Ethereum network fees trying to sandwich traders punting on predominantly low-cap tokens.  That has driven up fees of the entire network, data from Dune Analytics shows. Each transaction on the Ethereum network costs over $10 as of Asian morning hours on Wednesday – ten times more than last week’s $1 level.  The actions of Jaredfromsubway.eth mean they spent 7% of all fees on Ethereum in the past 24 hours, the data shows, becoming the top spender on the network.  That is ahead of fees spent by Arbitrum, a layer 2 blockchain that batches transactions on the Ethereum network, and Uniswap, the most-used decentralized exchange.  It is unclear how much Jaredfromsubway.eth made from their front-running actions, but given they spent a significant amount – and continue to do so – the gains likely exceed costs by a significant amount.  As such, research firm Sealaunch has estimated Jaredfromsubway.eth's gains at over $1.4 million since Tuesday, as per a tweet.  Meanwhile, the pepe frenzy is on in full force. Pepe tokens nearly doubled in value in the past 24 hours as Crypto Twitter traders moved over their DOGE-themed token obsession to bet on the internet meme instead, as CoinDesk reported.  Scores of pepe wannabes have popped up as well, as have chad, wojak, and babypepe – each a nod to internet memes.  Most of these are unlikely to last beyond a few weeks. But unlike then, entities like Jaredlikesubway.eth is eating the gains while fresh.",NEGATIVE,PEPE,ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ARB | PEPE,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/04/19/ethereum-fees-spike-as-bots-spend-millions-to-frontrun-punters-of-pepe-chad,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0684441f2761c5b6cc25f8c01b8e19463949a7cb-2906x1634.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin regained its perch above $30K, but its rally stalled; ether hovers near $2,100.

But the BTC rally stalled around $30,300 by midday, and the largest cryptocurrency by market cap was up just 3.3% over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin had dipped as low as about $29,100 on Monday before rebounding, as investors seemed to regain some of their prior zest for assets that hold value even as concerns about the banking industry have faded.  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Kaiko senior research analyst Dessislava Aubert called the current rally ""macro driven"" and said that its ongoing strength would depend on liquidity.  The rally ""started with the [U.S. Federal Reserve] providing emergency liquidity to banks in the United States,"" Aubert said. ""So definitely, liquidity is playing a huge role.""  She added: ""We have seen that markets are expecting great cuts in the second half of the year. So there is still a lot of uncertainty around whether this will be the case or not. Ultimately, it will depend on how U.S. monetary policy turns out.""  Ether climbed above $2,100 for the second time in three days before dipping below the threshold and then rising again. The second-largest crypto by market capitalization was recently changing hands at about $2,100, up about 1.5%. A post-Ethereum Shanghai upgrade sell-off has yet to materialize.  Other major cryptos were solidly green, with ICP, the token of blockchain-based, smart contracts platform Internet Computer, recently rising 15% to trade at about $6.80. XRP, the native crypto of the blockchain-based, payments-focused platform XRP ledger, was up more than 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index, which measures the performance of the overall crypto market, was recently up 2.7% and in significant uptrend territory on a one to five scale.  Equity indexes spent the day largely running in place as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 were all within a few fractions of a percentage point of where they stood at the close of trading Monday. Gold ticked upward to $2,017, but was still down from its near record highs of last week when assets that held value were in vogue. The yield on two- and 10-year Treasury edged up slightly but last week's surge has stalled.  In an email to CoinDesk, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of Pastel Network, a decentralized blockchain for non-fungible tokens (NFT), cryptos and Web3 technology, attributed bitcoin's plunge under $30,000 to ""converging elements,"" particularly the looming prospect of an inflation-focused Fed continuing its diet of hawkish interest rate hikes. But he also noted a loss of public confidence in the dollar and banking system.  ""People ... are seeking a decentralized safe haven asset that is an inflation hedge,"" he said.  He added: ""There are also macroeconomic conditions to consider. With an easing [consumer price index] and recessionary signals, the market seems to be pricing in potentially dovish Fed policies, which could lead to a risk-on craze. Bitcoin has found itself in somewhat of a paradoxical environment, and there may be price fluctuation to weather until the Fed’s short and medium-term monetary policies become clearer.""

This generally involves searching for explanations as to why prices are trending up or down or what triggered a sharp move.  Often there is an obvious explanation – an earnings surprise or an unexpected corporate action. Sometimes the cause isn't so easy to see – flows of funds, an evolving user base, steady product development and so on.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  With bitcoin (BTC), it’s even harder to discern what is driving sentiment shifts at any given time because it doesn’t have earnings, there are no corporate actions, regulation isn’t the threat it is for some other crypto assets and the narratives are multiple and varied. There isn’t even universal agreement as to what bitcoin is, let alone what drives its price.  But our search for reason amid chaos encourages us to latch on to something that makes sense, and if it is a narrative that justifies our interest while highlighting a timely concept, then so much the better.  Store of value  One phrase we’re hearing a lot of these days is “store of value.” It tends to mean different things to different people, but in general, it refers to an asset that holds its value relative to a broad basket of other assets over a long stretch of time.  In spite of its short-term price volatility and sharp bear markets, bitcoin is a store of value because it is the only asset traded on liquid exchanges today with a programmatic and verifiable hard cap. With other “hard assets” (those with limited supply) such as gold, diamonds or real estate, we don’t know the supply cap, nor do we know how much is currently in existence.  Plus, with other “hard assets,” the price influences the potential supply. For instance, if gold were to surge from $2,000 to $20,000 per ounce, new extraction methods would become viable, boosting the theoretical cap. Bitcoin is the only asset traded on liquid exchanges for which the price has no influence whatsoever on the supply. It is the hardest of hard assets.  What’s more, the supply of its most common denominator – the U.S. dollar – has been increasing over the decades, and more recently at an astonishing pace. We are likely about to embark on another wave of monetary easing, involving lower interest rates and the incentivization of credit to overcome declining economic growth and consumption.  An increase in the supply of USD above what economic growth can absorb will – all other things being equal – decrease its value relative to other assets, and following basic math, if the value of the denominator drops, that of the ratio increases. Bitcoin is a store of value and a hedge against currency debasement.
