32153939,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633712,1723071621,Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Following Crash Below $0.1,"Dogecoin (DOGE) was one of the tokens significantly affected by the recent crypto market crash. With the crypto market recovering, the meme coin is showing signs of life and is looking to reclaim the psychological support level of $0.1, having bounced off key support. Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support With $0.1 In Sight Crypto analyst World of Charts mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Dogecoin is bouncing from the key support at $0.09. In line with this, the analyst revealed that he will be adding to his position for the long term as this recent crash can give “massive returns” in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Over? Veteran Trader Predicts Rebound To $90,000 Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo highlighted Dogecoin’s impressive bounce above $0.09, with the critical support level of $0.1 currently in sight for the foremost meme coin. Like World of Charts, Crypto Kaleo also suggested that the recent price crash for DOGE was a massive investment opportunity considering the heights the meme coin could still reach in this bull run. The analyst labelled the drop below $0.1 as a “gift” while predicting that Dogecoin will still rise to $1 in the next few months. In a more recent analysis, Crypto Kaleo opined that the worst is over for Dogecoin and that DOGE’s drop to around $0.08 was likely the bottom. He explained that he feels good about where major cap tokens have currently dipped to and doesn’t see them going much lower. As such, Dogecoin is unlikely to dip to between $0.06 and $0.07, which he had expected earlier. As to what is next for Dogecoin, Crypto Kaleo mentioned that the meme coin will experience “several months of chop” in the $0.08 to $0.13 range before it enjoys that parabolic rally to $1 in early 2025. DOGE Not Yet Out Of The Woods Crypto analyst Kevin Capital (formerly OG Yomi) recently offered a different view and suggested that DOGE could still experience a significant price drop before reclaiming the $0.1 support zone. The analyst claimed that Dogecoin is “definitely” still in a downtrend and “has a lot of work to do” before it can flip bullish on its current price structure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Running Out Of Coins As Dominance Hits 3-Year High However, he noted that the foremost meme coin showed a lot of “resilience” to close the three-day candle above the three-day 200 simple moving average (SMA). He further remarked that Dogecoin’s successful break out above $0.143 would be key to creating a new bullish structure. Kevin is one of the crypto analysts who is most bullish on Dogecoin, as he once predicted that the meme coin could rise to as high as $3 in this market cycle. At the time of writing, Dogecoin is trading around $0.098, down almost in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

32151719,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633910,1723067735,BREAKING: XRP Price Rallies 27% As Ripple Secures Major Win In SEC Lawsuit,"In just one hour, the XRP price rallied 27% to a one-week high of $0.6406 on Wednesday after Judge Analisa Torres ordered Ripple Labs to pay only $125 million of the $2 billion fine sought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) against the blockchain payments company after a four-year legal battle. Ripple’s Legal Victory In the ruling, the court, applying a test derived from the Supreme Court, determined that Ripple’s Institutional Sales constituted offers or sales of investment contracts. However, the Court differentiated Ripple’s Programmatic Sales and Other Distributions, finding that they did not fall into this category. Additionally, the Court clarified that the individual sales conducted by Ripple co-founders Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse did not qualify as offers or sales of investment contracts for reasons akin to those outlined for Ripple’s Programmatic Sales. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative: Shorts’ Turn To Get Squeezed? When deliberating on the penalty, the Court concluded that a first-tier penalty was fitting in this instance, noting the absence of allegations related to fraud, deceit, or manipulation, along with the lack of established deliberate or reckless disregard for regulatory requirements. Moreover, the Court noted that the SEC had not proven that Ripple’s failure to register the Institutional Sales resulted in significant losses or risks to investors. Consequently, the SEC’s motion for remedies and the entry of final judgment were partially granted and partially denied. The Court’s decision mandates an injunction against Ripple to prevent future securities law violations and imposes a civil penalty amounting exactly to $125,035,150. In this regard, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stated that the court reduced the $2 billion penalty sought by the SEC by 94%, recognizing that the SEC had “overplayed their hand”. Garlinghouse further stated, “This is a victory for Ripple, the industry and the rule of law. The SEC’s headwinds against the whole of the XRP community are gone.” XRP Price Predictions Point To Mega Bull Run With XRP not considered a security by the court, the token’s price saw one of its best rallies of the year in a matter of hours, surpassing Monday’s pre-market crash price resulting from global economic uncertainty. Related Reading: Analyst Says Bitcoin Bottom Is Not In, Will Price Crash Below $50,000 Again?

Another analyst under the pseudonym “360 Trader” on social media platform X, also claimed that now the XRP’s “chains are off,” arguing that the XRP price will fly this cycle with a target ranging between $4 and $8.

32150897,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633731,1723066212,Dogwifhat Gains Traction: WIF Jumps 19% Beyond Major Resistance Level,"Dogwifhat (WIF) has recently demonstrated significant bullish momentum, as its price surged 19% to break through the $1.5 critical resistance level. The breakout above this key resistance suggests increasing buying pressure for the cryptocurrency and opens up new possibilities for further upward movement. As WIF maintains its momentum above the $1.5 resistance mark, the question is whether the bulls can continue driving the price higher toward the next resistance level at $2.2, or if a pullback is imminent. This article aims to inform the audience about the significant price movement of Dogwifhat, provide a detailed technical analysis of the breakout above the $1.5 resistance level, and assess market sentiment along with potential future price directions including key levels to watch. WIF was trading at around $1.69 and has increased by over 19% with a market capitalization of over $1.7 billion and a trading volume of over $734 Million as of the time of writing. In the last 24 hours, the asset’s market cap has increased by more than 19%, while its trading volume has decreased by more than 20% Technical Analysis: Breaking Through $1.5 Resistance Currently, the price of WIF on the 4-hour chart has printed two bullish candlesticks, surpassing the $1.5 resistance mark towards the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Since breaching this key resistance level, the digital asset has experienced a consistent upward trend, suggesting that bulls are taking control and could further drive the price higher. Additionally, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line of the indicator has successfully risen above 50% and is currently heading to 70%, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing and the asset might experience more upward movement. On the 1-day chart, although WIF is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it can be observed that the crypto asset with a single bullish momentum candlestick has surged past the $1.5 resistance level. With this recent bullish momentum, the meme coin could extend its rally toward the next resistance level at $2.25. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is ascending from the oversold zone toward 50%, further supporting the potential for a continued bullish move and indicating that buying pressure in the market is stronger than selling pressure. Potential for Further Gains: What to Expect For WIF As WIF’s price continues to gain traction, it is expected to approach the next key resistance level at $2.2. Should the price break and close above this level, it may continue its bullish move toward the next resistance point at $3.58 and potentially advance to even higher areas. However, if WIF encounters resistance at the $2.2 mark and experiences a rejection, it could start to decline toward the $1.5 level. Should the price break below this support level, it may signal a further bearish move, leading to additional declines towards the $1.02 mark and beyond.

42390655,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd50zV,1723061707,"Judge Fines Ripple $125M, Bans Future Securities Law Violations in Long-Running SEC Case","A federal judge imposed a $125 million fine on Ripple after finding last year that its institutional sales of XRP violated federal securities laws.  The judge reiterated her view that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through exchanges did not violate federal securities laws.  A federal judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in civil penalties and imposed an injunction against future securities law violations on Wednesday.  District Judge Analisa Torres, of the Southern District of New York, imposed the fine after finding that 1,278 institutional sale transactions by Ripple violated securities law, leading to the fine. The $125.035 million fine is well below the $1 billion in disgorgement and prejudgment interest and $900 million in civil penalties the SEC sought.  Wednesday's order on remedies follows the judge's July 2023 ruling in the case itself, finding that Ripple violated federal securities laws through its direct sale of XRP to institutional clients, though she also ruled that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP to retail clients through exchanges did not violate any securities laws.  The SEC tried unsuccessfully to appeal that portion of the ruling while the case was ongoing.  Judge Torres also banned Ripple from future violations of federal securities laws on Wednesday, saying that while she isn't making a judgement that Ripple has violated any laws after the SEC filed its lawsuit, the company may well ""cross the line"" in a section referring to Ripple's ""on demand liquidity"" offerings.  ""Rather, the Court finds that Ripple’s willingness to push the boundaries of the Order evinces a likelihood that it will eventually (if it has not already) cross the line,"" she said. ""On balance, the Court finds that there is a reasonable probability of future violations, meriting the issuance of an injunction.""  The injunction document requires Ripple to file a registration statement if it intends to sell any securities.  The SEC is likely to appeal the July 2023 ruling now that the judge has imposed a sentence, after the same judge denied the SEC's motion for an interlocutory appeal last year.  The SEC and Ripple settled charges tied to CEO Brad Garlinghouse and other executives after that interlocutory appeal was denied.

32147829,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633704,1723060839,Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative: Shorts’ Turn To Get Squeezed?,"Data shows the Bitcoin funding rates on exchanges have turned negative, a sign that the shorts have now become the dominant force in the market. Bitcoin Funding Rates Have Turned Negative After Market Crash As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the Bitcoin funding rates have seen a sharp decline recently. The “funding rate” refers to a metric that keeps track of the periodic fee that derivatives contract holders are currently exchanging with each other. When the value of this indicator is positive, it means the long investors are paying a premium to the short ones in order to hold onto their positions. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is shared by the majority in the sector. Related Reading: Chainlink (LINK) Recovers 20% As Network Lights Up With Activity On the other hand, the metric being negative implies a bearish mentality could be the dominant one in the market as the short holders outweigh the longs. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this Bitcoin indicator for all exchanges over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin funding rate had been positive throughout the year 2024, save for a couple of small dips into the negative region, until this latest crash, which finally took the indicator to notable red values. The earlier positive values were naturally due to the fact that the market had a bullish atmosphere to it, so the average investor was trying to bet on the price to rise. From the graph, it’s visible that this positive sentiment was the strongest during the rally to the all-time high (ATH) price fueled by the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) demand. During the consolidation period that had followed this rally, BTC had seen a couple of notable drawdowns, but they weren’t enough to shake off the bullish mood. The recent sharp crash, though, appears to have finally caused investors to have a bearish outlook on the cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin crash had resulted in a huge amount of long liquidations in the market, triggering what’s known as a squeeze. In a squeeze event, a sharp swing in the price causes mass liquidations, which in turn fuels the price move further. This then unleashes a cascade of more liquidations. Since the latest such event involved the longs, it would be called a long squeeze. In general, an event of this kind is more likely to affect the side of the derivatives market that is more dominant. As this power balance has shifted towards the shorts now, it’s possible that the market could instead see a short squeeze in the near future. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin In A Bear Market Now? Here’s What On-Chain Data Suggests Naturally, it’s not necessary that a short squeeze should take place, but if the price ends up witnessing some volatility, it’s possible it may end up punishing the short-heavy market.

While JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon continues to worry about inflation, former FRBNY President Bill Dudley said the economy is facing imminent recession and the Fed needs to cut rates soon and often.  The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} has tumbled after rallying earlier Wednesday as U.S. stocks gave up a sizable early advance to turn lower in U.S. mid-afternoon action.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} at press time was trading at $54,800, down just shy of 4% from 24 hours ago and more than 6% from the $57,600 level touched a few hours earlier. Ether {{ETH}} is faring worse at $2,322, lower by 7.1% over the last day and sending its ratio against bitcoin to the lowest level in more than three years. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is down 3%.  Trading got off to a good start Wednesday after Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida, said that the central bank wouldn't hike borrowing costs when markets are unstable. The dovish comments sent the yen lower and the Japanese stock market and U.S. index futures nicely higher. While the Nikkei managed to close higher by 1.2% and U.S. stocks opened with gains of around 1.5%, the bullishness has faded throughout the course of the day.  Roughly ninety minutes before the close of trade, the Nasdaq is down 0.8% and the S&P 500 off 0.6%.  Speaking with CNBC Wednesday, JPMorgan CEO didn't sound so sure that the U.S. Federal Reserve would be successful in returning inflation to its 2% target. Worrying him on inflation are things like deficit spending, ""remilitarization,"" and the green economy shift. Of what appears to be an imminent Fed rate cut, Dimon says it's likely coming, but he doesn't expect it to have much effect.  Former Fed member says central bank missing recession signs  Meanwhile, former Federal Bank of New York President Bill Dudley suggests the Fed needs to cut rates soon and in a sizable fashion.  ""Evidence of a weakening labor market and moderating inflation has accumulated rapidly, strongly suggesting that the Fed is behind the curve,"" wrote Dudley this afternoon on Bloomberg. He noted that the recent fast rise in the unemployment rate has breached the ""Sahm rule"" threshold (named after economist Claudia Sahm), thus indicating far higher unemployment and a U.S. recession in on the way.  ""Monetary policy is tight and becoming tighter as price and wage inflation moderate,"" continued Dudley. He argues that just getting to a neutral fed funds rate would require at least 150 basis points in rate cuts and if the Fed needs to get into the accommodative range, another 100 basis points in cuts on top of that might be necessary.  ""Prepare for more volatility in stock and bond markets,"" concluded Dudley, who expects Fed Chair Jerome Powell's ""deliberative manner"" to prevent any quick easing moves.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/07/crypto-turns-broadly-lower-in-us-afternoon-trade-as-stocks-give-away-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80f2f833ba0f2c369edfb8875c4b8cbd636e7e6e-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32144594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633868,1723056013,Top Analyst Doubt DOGE Will Generate More Profits & Mpeppe Is a Profit Machine,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, the names Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and the new contender, Mpeppe (MPEPE), have been generating significant buzz. These tokens, each with its unique features and dedicated community, are poised to create more millionaires than ever before. Here’s a detailed look at why these three cryptocurrencies are in the spotlight. The Memecoin Pioneer: Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has always been a favorite in the crypto community, known for its humorous origins and strong community support. Created in 2013 as a parody of Bitcoin, Dogecoin has grown far beyond its meme status. DOGE uses a modified version of the Litecoin blockchain, leveraging a proof-of-work consensus mechanism with the Scrypt algorithm, which promotes inclusivity and decentralization by making it accessible to individual miners. Recent Developments Recently, Dogecoin (DOGE) introduced Doginals, or DRC-20 tokens, allowing users to store data like images and texts on the blockchain. This feature has increased the utility of DOGE, making it more than just a memecoin. Additionally, Dogecoin’s collaboration with Elon Musk has kept it in the limelight. Musk’s endorsement, along with improvements like a 25% reduction in CO2 emissions for transactions, has bolstered DOGE’s appeal. Despite these positive developments, Dogecoin (DOGE) has faced challenges. A significant whale movement, involving the transfer of DOGE worth approximately $11 million to Robinhood, led to a dramatic price drop of 24%, pushing it down to the tenth position among the largest cryptocurrencies. This volatility underscores the risks but also the potential rewards for DOGE holders. The Versatile Competitor: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB), launched in 2020, has quickly become a formidable competitor to Dogecoin (DOGE). Created as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, SHIB has leveraged the advantages of Ethereum’s infrastructure, including its transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient than DOGE’s proof-of-work system. Innovative Ecosystem Shiba Inu (SHIB) has expanded its ecosystem significantly, introducing decentralized exchanges like ShibaSwap and additional tokens such as LEASH and BONE. The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution, along with SHIB-themed merchandise, publications, and games like Shiba Eternity, has diversified SHIB’s applications and increased its attractiveness to investors. Despite the innovative strides, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has not been immune to market fluctuations. The token burn event, where over 81 million SHIB tokens were burned, saw a temporary surge in interest but also highlighted the volatility in SHIB’s price. Currently, SHIB has a circulating supply of 589.27 billion tokens, with regular burn events designed to increase scarcity and drive value. The New Contender: Mpeppe (MPEPE) Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a new player in the crypto market, capturing the interest of investors looking for high returns. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at 0.00107 USDT per token, with over 75% of the tokens already sold, raising a substantial $589,695. This strong presale performance indicates significant investor confidence. Promising Potential Mpeppe (MPEPE) sets itself apart by integrating decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms, providing real utility beyond its meme status. This combination of practical applications and community engagement makes Mpeppe an appealing investment, with analysts predicting substantial gains. The token’s innovative approach and strategic positioning in the market suggest it could outperform established memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Conclusion: A New Era of Crypto Millionaires Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Mpeppe (MPEPE) each offer unique opportunities for investors. While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have established themselves with strong communities and innovative features, Mpeppe’s promising start and practical applications position it as a strong contender in the crypto space. As these tokens continue to evolve and attract attention, they are set to create more millionaires in the ever-expanding world of cryptocurrencies. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on the growth potential of these tokens should consider the unique advantages and risks associated with each. As always, thorough research and careful consideration are crucial when navigating the volatile crypto market.

32144662,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633713,1723055422,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Bottom Is Not In, Will Price Crash Below $50,000 Again?","Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa recently suggested that the Bitcoin bottom isn’t yet in and that the flagship crypto could still drop to new lows. Meanwhile, other crypto analysts like Mikybull Cypto have made a case for why the bottom is in and suggested that it is unlikely that Bitcoin will drop below $50,000 again. Bitcoin Bottom Is Likely At The $40,000 Range Altcoin Sherpa mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin is more likely to find its bottom at the $40,000 range rather than at 50,000. He noted that this would mean a “few more nasty wicks, a few more liquidations, and a bit more pain” as the flagship crypto could still drop below the psychological level of $50,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Sees Sharp 24% Drop, Where Does Price Go From Here? The analyst made these statements while predicting how the next few months could play out for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Altcoin Sherpa added that he expects Bitcoin’s price to range for the next one to four months. He further predicted that the market would witness “temporary pockets of altcoin moves,” leading to euphoria among market participants. Why The BTC Bottom Is In Mikybull Crypto offered a different view and explained why the Bitcoin bottom is already in, with the flagship crypto unlikely to drop below $50,000. Using the Elliot Wave Theory to analyze Bitcoin’s price action, the analyst mentioned that the chart shows that the wave four macro correction is ending. He remarked that wave five will take Bitcoin to a minimum target of $135,000, which should happen in the next few months. Mikybull Crypto further alluded to the spike in the volatility index (VIX), which he noted usually signals a macro bottom, just like it did in 2020. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is another indicator the analyst highlighted to show that the macro bottom is in. He added that the Bank of Japan’s assurance of no further rate hikes until the market stabilizes has also helped to reduce the pressure on Japan’s carry trade, Lastly, Mikybull Crypto mentioned that Bitcoin’s funding rate is in negative territory, which usually leads to a short squeeze. He added that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs trading volume is on a new level, and whale accumulation for the past thirty days has never slowed, which he claimed shows that institutional investors are bidding rather than distributing. Related Reading: XRP Whales Take Advantage Of 20% Drop To Buy Millions Worth Of Tokens Cryptoquant’s CEO Ki Young Ju recently revealed that 404,448 BTC have been moved to permanent holder addresses over the past 30 days.

32144267,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633865,1723054803,Here’s Why Dogecoin Holders See More Benefit In Investing Mpeppe (MPEPE),"The dynamic world of cryptocurrencies has always been about finding the next big opportunity. Recently, Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are beginning to shift their focus towards Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new player promising impressive returns and innovative utility. As the market evolves, understanding these trends and their implications is crucial for any savvy investor. The Rise and Challenges of Dogecoin Dogecoin (DOGE) has had a remarkable journey since its inception in 2013. Originally created as a joke, it has grown to become one of the most recognizable names in the crypto market. Dogecoin started with a negligible value and soared to a current live price of $0.09534, boasting a market cap of $13.84 billion. However, it has recently faced significant challenges. In the past week, Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced a 26.14% drop, which affected its market position and investor sentiment. A notable incident contributing to this decline was a whale moving approximately $11 million worth of Dogecoin (DOGE) to Robinhood, sparking panic and subsequent sell-offs. This event led to massive liquidations, with $13.08 million in long positions wiped out. Despite a recent 14.12% rebound, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains under pressure, and analysts, like CryptoKaleo, predict that DOGE might fall below $0.07 before potentially rallying to $1. Enter Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender In stark contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining traction as a viable alternative. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is priced at 0.00107 USDT per token, with over 75% of the tokens already sold, raising $589,695. This rapid uptake signifies strong investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential. What sets Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart is its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms, offering real utility beyond speculative trading. This combination of practicality and profitability is attracting a diverse range of investors, making Mpeppe a compelling option. The Utility and Profitability of Mpeppe The utility of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its innovative approach. Unlike many meme coins that rely solely on hype, Mpeppe offers tangible value through its DeFi and gaming integrations. This functionality not only provides entertainment but also potential earnings, which is a significant draw for investors looking for more than just speculative gains. Crypto analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s prospects, forecasting a potential 1000x return. This optimism is fueled by Mpeppe’s strong community support and the significant interest it has garnered during its presale phase. Early investors stand to benefit immensely from these projected gains. Dogecoin’s Current Market Position Despite its struggles, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a major player in the crypto market. Its historical performance has demonstrated resilience, and its strong community continues to support it. However, the recent market dynamics highlight the volatility and the need for investors to diversify their portfolios. The drop in Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price and market position, falling to the tenth spot among cryptocurrencies, underscores the challenges it faces. The massive liquidations and the reduction in network activity, with active addresses dropping significantly, paint a picture of a coin in flux. Yet, the reduction in whale sell-offs suggests some level of confidence in a potential rebound. The Future of Mpeppe and Dogecoin As Dogecoin (DOGE) navigates its current challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents itself as a promising alternative. The innovative utility and high return potential make Mpeppe an attractive investment. For Dogecoin (DOGE) holders looking to diversify and hedge against volatility, Mpeppe offers a viable option with its unique blend of DeFi and gaming functionalities. The crypto market is constantly evolving, and staying ahead of the curve means identifying and acting on new opportunities. Mpeppe (MPEPE) not only represents such an opportunity but also exemplifies the innovative spirit of the crypto world. Conclusion: Embracing New Opportunities For investors, the decision to pivot from Dogecoin (DOGE) to Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by the latter’s promise of utility and profitability. As the market continues to evolve, embracing new opportunities like Mpeppe can lead to significant gains. The future of cryptocurrencies lies in their ability to provide real value and engage communities, and Mpeppe is well-positioned to do just that.

Mpeppe (MPEPE), a fresh contender in the meme coin arena, has taken the market by storm, boasting an impressive 310% increase in value. Meanwhile, Dogecoin struggles to maintain its position amidst significant market fluctuations and declining confidence among traders. Dogecoin’s Struggle: Market Position and Community Sentiment Dogecoin (DOGE), once celebrated for its strong community and market presence, has recently faced a dramatic downturn. The cryptocurrency has slipped to the tenth position among the largest digital assets, reflecting a 24% price drop. This decline highlights the volatile nature of the crypto market and raises questions about Dogecoin’s future. The drop was exacerbated when a large holder, or “whale,” moved approximately $11 million worth of Dogecoin (DOGE) to Robinhood, causing panic and further sell-offs among traders. The Impact of Large Market Movements Large market movements, such as the recent Dogecoin (DOGE) transaction, often trigger a chain reaction that affects overall market confidence. Traders who were betting on a price increase found themselves facing substantial losses. This emotional and financial strain has intensified the uncertainty surrounding Dogecoin (DOGE) and its ability to rebound from its current slump. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Market Sensation In contrast to Dogecoin’s struggles, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is enjoying a meteoric rise. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, Mpeppe is trading at 0.00107 USDT per token, with 75.26% of the tokens already sold. This rapid uptake, resulting in $589,695 raised, indicates strong investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential.

The next presale stage will see the price increase to 0.001777 USDT, further incentivizing early investment. Shifts in the Crypto Landscape: Dogecoin’s Decline and Mpeppe’s Ascent The current market dynamics reflect a broader shift in the crypto landscape.

32143801,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633858,1723054009,Dogecoin Whales Turn Their Focus to Mpeppe For Its Utility And Profits,"Dogecoin (DOGE), once the undisputed king of meme coins, is now facing fierce competition from a rising star: Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a staple in the cryptocurrency market for years, recent developments indicate that Mpeppe might be the new contender capable of outshining the legendary Dogecoin (DOGE) with its potential 1000x gains. Let’s dive into the recent performance and prospects of these two cryptocurrencies. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Kid on the Block Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, priced at 0.00107 USDT per token. The presale has already raised $589,695, with 75.26% of the total tokens sold. This rapid uptake reflects growing investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential. With only 235,023,783 tokens remaining, the buzz around Mpeppe is palpable. Mpeppe’s success in the presale phase is a testament to its promising future. Investors are eager to get in early, anticipating massive returns as the token prepares to transition to the next stage at a higher price of 0.001777 USDT. The strong presale performance indicates that Mpeppe is well on its way to making significant waves in the crypto market. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Current Struggles Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a challenging period. The live price of Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.098749 per DOGE/USD, with a market cap of $14.36 billion USD. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin has seen a decline of 0.82% in the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $996.73 million USD. This performance has resulted in Dogecoin slipping to the 10th position among the largest cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin’s decline is attributed to several factors, including a significant whale movement of 117.52 million Dogecoin (DOGE) worth $11 million USD to Robinhood, an American exchange. This movement sparked panic in the market, indicating a potential sell-off. Additionally, Dogecoin faced massive liquidations, with $14.74 million USD liquidated in the last 24 hours, highlighting the extreme volatility and market pressure DOGE is currently under. Market Reactions and Predictions The recent downturn has seen Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price fall below $0.08, a stark contrast to its peak of $0.14 just two weeks ago. Technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are showing bearish momentum. The MACD is in the negative zone, and the RSI indicates that Dogecoin (DOGE) is oversold. These metrics suggest that unless there is significant buying pressure, Dogecoin may continue to struggle in the near term. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum. With strong community support and a successful presale, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a serious contender in the crypto space. The token’s innovative approach and high return potential are attracting investors looking for the next big opportunity. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) The optimism surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by its unique value proposition. Unlike many meme coins, Mpeppe offers real utility through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. This blend of fun and functionality is attracting a diverse range of investors seeking substantial returns. Crypto analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s potential, predicting that it could achieve up to 1000x returns. This forecast is based on Mpeppe’s innovative approach, strong community support, and the significant interest it has garnered during its presale phase. Early investors are particularly optimistic about the substantial gains they could achieve as Mpeppe continues to gain traction. For those interested in investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. Ensuring the correct contract address is crucial to avoid scams and secure your investment. Conclusion While Dogecoin (DOGE) grapples with its current market challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable rival with the potential to deliver massive returns. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) recent struggles highlight the volatility and risks inherent in the crypto market. In contrast, Mpeppe’s strong presale performance and promising future make it an attractive option for investors seeking high returns. As the crypto landscape evolves, Mpeppe is set to become a key player, possibly overshadowing the once-dominant Dogecoin. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on new opportunities should consider Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a viable option. With its unique value proposition and high return potential, Mpeppe could be the next big thing in the crypto world.

But after a week like this, how can we not? Founders and developers have learned the hard way how the vagaries of price-go-down can affect the industry's fortunes. Read on.  ALSO:  Ronin's latest $12M exploit puts two-year-old ""rigorous"" security focus under microscope.  Top picks from the past week's Protocol Village column: Mysticeti, Sui, Polyhedra, Injective, Transak, Succinct.  Nearly $50 million of blockchain project fundraisings: Curio, Andrena, Daylight, Cartridge, Zoth, Khalani, Pichi.  Arthur Hayes unveils Bitcoin Ordinals release ""Airheads,"" invests in Oyl wallet.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Network News  Bitcoin price (seen here as the chain of red and green candles) plotted against its 50-day and 200-day simple moving price averages – now converging toward a ""death cross."" (Omkar Godbole/CoinDesk/TradingView)   DEATH CROSS! Crypto markets suffered one of their worst sell-offs in years, a week-long tumble that took the bitcoin (BTC) price down to $50,000, from $70,000 just last week – darkening the mood across a blockchain industry that until very recently seemed to be approaching ebullient. Despite a slight price rebound on Tuesday and Wednesday, all members of the benchmark CoinDesk 20 index remain deeply in the red over the past week, with ether (ETH) suffering its biggest single-day price drop since May 2021. Alternative.me's frequently cited ""Fear and Greed Index"" of crypto-market sentiment swung to ""extreme fear"" from ""greed,"" and a dreaded pattern known as the ""death cross"" is now forming in bitcoin's price chart, as spotted by CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole.  For now, the default view is that this is a market blip and will quickly pass. (Memecoins appear to already be back.) The question is whether questions might again start to percolate in the blockchain industry – if developers, project employees and fundraising founders will soon endure another round of the bruising existential nerviness that permeated the industry as recently as late last year.  Macroeconomic and crypto-native factors were cited as catalysts for the past week's selling: the prospect of rising Japanese interest rates (since walked back), a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report, tensions in the Middle East, poor earnings at tech firms, deflating of the AI hype, bitcoin miner selling and rumors that market maker Jump Trading might be selling ETH due to speculation it would be forced to exit the crypto business due to regulatory investigations. The end result was some $1 billion in crypto-futures liquidations, along with $350 million of decentralized-finance (DeFi) liquidations.  As is often the case, there were some winners, along with opportunists who tried to buy the dip or disseminate words of encouragement. As a group, bitcoin whales, as large holders are known, accumulated more of the cryptocurrency during the market squall, though small investors were apparently so unnerved that they reduced their stakes, CoinDesk's Krisztian Sandor reported, citing data from blockchain analytics firm IntoTheBlock. Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) held up surprisingly well, with just $168 million of net outflows on Monday – versus the ""couple billion"" that Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said he was expecting. Ethereum ETFs actually scored net inflows.  An address linked to the infamous $200 million Nomad cross-chain bridge exploit in 2022 was apparently tempted off the sidelines, spending about $40 million in stablecoins to buy up ETH at the heavily discounted price, The Defiant reported. Tron founder Justin Sun chimed in on X to say ""we're creating a $1 billion fund to combat FUD,"" which is short for ""fear, uncertainty and doubt."" Notably, DeFi platforms maintained operations throughout the drama, successfully processing liquidations of crypto collateral, and the lending protocol Aave even reportedly generated a tidy windfall of $6 million in fee revenue.  Sean Farrell, a crypto analyst at FundStrat, wrote Tuesday that while he was ""encouraged"" by the ""impressively strong"" market bounce, ""We think it’s right to keep some dry powder on hand over the next couple of weeks.""  This is a T-shirt I bought at Goodwill a couple years ago for $3.99. I have no idea what it was originally supposed to stand for, but in my mind it stands for a less G-rated version of, ""Buy the Freaking Dip."" (Bradley Keoun)  RONIN RUN-IN: It's only been two years since the Ronin Network made headlines from suffering a $625 million exploit, one of the largest attacks of all time in the history of decentralized finance (DeFi), which is rife with reports of massive hacks. The episode was so jarring for Ronin – an Ethereum-compatible blockchain forged for gaming, launched by Axie Infinity creator Sky Mavis – that the project's documentation refers specifically to the lessons learned: ""This incident led Sky Mavis to become a fully antifragile, zero-trust organization. Sky Mavis has implemented rigorous internal security measures to prevent future attacks. All code has been fully reviewed and optimized, with security experts auditing the entire architecture."" Well, on Monday, Ronin posted on X that an upgrade of its bridge had ""introduced an issue"" that ultimately allowed hackers to make off with about $12 million worth of ETH and the stablecoin USDC. Ronin Network co-founder Aleksander Larsen tweeted that some $850 million of funds were safe on the project's bridge, and it was later disclosed that the hackers were apparently of the ""white hat"" variety – willing to return the stolen funds, typically in exchange for a bounty. The project's official account on X went out of its way to point out that the ETH and USDC tokens taken out in a single transaction withdrawal represented the ""maximum amount"" that was possible to extract: ""The bridge limit serves as a critical safeguard to increase the security of large fund withdrawals, and it effectively prevented further damage in this exploit."" A full post-mortem is expected next week.  Elsewhere:  The former CEO of crypto platform Uphold, J.P. Thieriot, is trying to drum up crypto support for Vice President Kamala Harris as she pursues the Democratic nomination in the presidential election, arguing that former President Donald Trump is offering empty promises to the industry.  Trump Sneakers, a website owned by former President Donald Trump that sells themed footwear and perfumes, earlier this week started listing a range of limited-edition sneakers including a Bitcoin-themed, high-top version that costs $499 a pair on pre-order. There are just 1,000 pairs of the bright orange version, and they already sold out.  The shares of bitcoin miner Core Scientific (CORZ) surged as much as 17% on Tuesday, outperforming other crypto-linked stocks, after the company signed an extension of its earlier high-performance computing (HPC) contract with CoreWeave. (According to its website, CoreWeave is a ""specialized cloud provider, delivering a massive scale of GPUs on top of the industry’s fastest and most flexible infrastructure."")  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Chart illustrating the drop in latency from a blockchain switching to the Mysticeti-C consensus on 106 independently run validators. (Mysticeti white paper authors)  1. Mysticeti, a consensus protocol based on directed acyclic graphs (DAG) that ""cuts consensus latency to 390 milliseconds and establishes Sui as the fastest consensus layer in the industry,"" has been deployed on Sui mainnet after a successful run on testnet, according to the team.  2. Polyhedra Network, a team building a crucial blockchain component known as a cryptographic ""prover,"" released a new platform called ""Proof Arena"" that will ""allow ZK-proof system creators to compare their systems against others in a clear and scientific manner while ensuring that all controllable variables are held constant,"" according to a press release Wednesday. Initially, the project will be set up to generate benchmarks for Polyhedra's own ""Expander"" ZK-proof system, Polygon's Plonky3, StarkWare's Stwo and Linea's Gnark. ""The team plans to support all open-source proof systems and will provide benchmarks for frequent ZK tasks like Keccak and Poseidon hash verification run on a variety of machine configurations,"" according to the press release.  3. Stakers on the Injective blockchain on Thursday passed the ""Altaris Mainnet Upgrade Proposal,"" also known as ""IIP-420,"" and deployment of the upgrade began soon afterward, according to social-media posts by the project. In a message to Protocol Village, the team described Altaris as ""a major update enhancing the trader, staker, developer and end-user experience. It includes an advanced RWA Oracle for expanded tokenized offerings, improved INJ Burn Auction mechanics and market enhancements like perpetual market launch permissions for native DEXs. Altaris introduces SDKs for Python, Go and TypeScript for developers, enriched interoperability with IBC hooks, streamlined governance, enhanced security for the Injective Bridge and Ledger wallet integration.""  4. Transak, a Web3 payments infrastructure provider, has ""officially launched wire transfers as a new payment method for U.S. users to purchase cryptocurrencies,"" according to the team. ""Implementing wire transfers for cryptocurrency transactions involves intricate processes, from handling bank transfers to ensuring accurate fund reconciliation. This is far from a streamlined task and requires a robust and lengthy product development cycle. Transak has invested significant time in building a comprehensive system that ensures smooth fund flow, demonstrating its commitment to providing a seamless user experience.""  5. Succinct, a platform for developers to build decentralized apps with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), announced SP1 1.0, the production-ready release of their zkVM, ""enabling builders to write real-world ZKPs with Rust and affordably generate proofs in real time,"" according to the team: ""The co-founder and CEO is Uma Roy. The platform has delivered up to a 10x performance gain in latency/cost, already securing over $1 billion in TVL, with thousands of proofs. With more than 100 billion CPU cycles proven on the prover network’s private beta, Succinct is trusted by Polygon and Celestia."" According to a blog post: ""We benchmark SP1 against RISC0 on three real-world workloads (Tendermint, Reth Block 17106222, and Reth Block 19409768) using a variety of cost-efficient AWS and Lambda Labs GPUs with on-demand pricing."" Also: ""SP1 is 100% open-source, allowing teams likeArgument (formerly known as Lurk Labs) andScroll to implement custom precompiles for their own use-cases that have dramatically decreased cycle count and accelerated proof-generation time.""

Wireless internet provider Andrena has raised $18 million in funding to develop a protocol for decentralized broadband. The protocol, known as DAWN, is a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN), designed to provide homes with internet without having to rely on centralized providers. DAWN is currently operating in a testnet environment ahead of launching on Solana, Andrena announced via email on Wednesday.  Daylight, building a decentralized protocol that will eventually allow users to build ""virtual power plants"" using ""distributed energy resources"" (DERs), launched a testnet and announced a $9 million funding round led by the venture capital firm a16z. Framework Ventures and existing investors Lerer Hippeau, Lattice Fund and Escape Velocity also participated.  Cartridge, a developer of provable games and the tooling and infrastructure that powers them, has completed a $7.5 million Series A funding round, led by Bitkraft Ventures with additional participation from Fabric, Dune, StarkWare, Primitive and Ergodic.  Zoth, a DeFi yield infrastructure company, raised $4 million in a strategic round to accelerate the launch of its Tokenized Liquid Note ($ZTLN). According to the team, the fundraising attracted ""significant investment from Taisu Ventures, G20, Fat Cat Ventures, GemHead Capital and other prominent companies.""  Blockscout, an open-source block explorer for EVM-based chains, completed a $3M seed round led by 1kx with participation from Primitive Ventures and Gnosis, according to the team.  EXCLUSIVE: Khalani, pioneer of a decentralized solver platform designed to unleash the full potential of intents,raised $2.5M in a seed round led by Ethereal Ventures, with participation from Nascent and Figment Capital. According to the team, angels include Arthur Hayes via Maelstrom, Jan Xie and Nick White.  Pichi Finance, a trustless points trading protocol offering price discovery to tokens pre and post-TGE, completed a $2.5 million seed funding round, led by UOB Venture Management, Signum Capital and Mantle Network.  Deals and grants  Screen grab from Arthur Hayes's post on the 'Airheads' Bitcoin Ordinals collection (Arthur Hayes/Airheads)  Arthur Hayes, co-founder of the BitMEX crypto exchange who now serves as chief investment officer of his own private-wealth office, Maelstrom, announced his first NFT collection, Airheads, using the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, and disclosed an investment in Oyl wallet. According to a blog post by Hayes: ""Each Airhead is an inflatable, balloon-like character generated using recursive art to visually represent the size and value of your digital portfolio at the point of mint.  The venture arm of cryptocurrency exchange OKX and the Aptos Foundation, which supports the development of the Aptos protocol, set up a $10 million fund to encourage the growth of the Aptos ecosystem and broader adoption of Web3. The accelerator fund, named Ankaa, will be used to develop projects built on Aptos, according to an emailed announcement.

MARA has significantly diluted shareholders, with the number of shares outstanding increasing 44 times in the last four years, primarily to finance operations and stock-based compensation. It is unclear to me whether MARA aims to be a Bitcoin mining play or position itself as an alternative to holding Bitcoin, especially with its recent diversification strategy. MARA's current market value is fair in my view, reflecting its current and projected Bitcoin holdings. However, the stock has shown variable performance relative to Bitcoin, adding uncertainty to its valuation. Due to the numerous variables at play, including shareholder dilution and unclear management direction, I rate MARA a HOLD. I think Investors are better off buying a Bitcoin ETF. Thesis: Despite its leadership in Bitcoin Mining, I find MARA's investment narrative unconvincing I see Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) as the best Bitcoin miner accessible to investors due to its leading hash rate and average Bitcoin production per day. In my view, the problem with MARA is not its leadership in Bitcoin mining, but rather the unclear narrative of why investing in this stock is preferable to simply holding Bitcoin. MARA has recently announced a plan to buy $100 Million in Bitcoin to embrace a ""HODL"" strategy for Bitcoin, mentioning management's belief in Bitcoin's long-term potential. However, the company has been financing itself primarily via shareholder dilution, with total shares outstanding increasing by a factor of 44X in the last 4 years. The issuance of new shares in Q2 alone was worth over $800 Million, or eight times more than the announced one-off purchase of Bitcoin. In this context, it is unclear to me whether management is trying to position the company as an alternative to holding Bitcoin or stick to being a Bitcoin mining play that relies on shareholders' dilution to finance operations. This investment thesis is further clouded by the fact that MARA recently started mining Kaspa, a relatively unknown cryptocurrency project, with a market capitalization below $4 Billion at the time of writing. I find this decision at odds with management's recent claims about believing in Bitcoin's long-term potential. Judging from the historical performance of MARA's stock against Bitcoin, I think the market is also uncertain about how to price this company. Based merely on current and projected Bitcoin holdings, I think MARA is fairly valued - something I will cover in this article, along with MARA's shareholders dilution and diversification strategy. However, because of an overall unclear investment narrative depending on too many variables, I rate the company a HOLD. Investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin would be better off, in my view, buying a Bitcoin ETF , or investing in MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ) if they can stomach high volatility. MARA: company profile of a leading Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ((MARA)) is, in my view, the best Bitcoin miner currently available to investors. I base this assertion on two data points: the company's average operational hash rate and the average number of Bitcoin MARA mines per day. The Average Operational hash rate of MARA stands at 24 EH/s in Q2. This compares with 11.4 EH/s for Riot Platforms, Inc. ( RIOT ) and 20.4 EH/s for CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) - two other publicly listed, US-based Bitcoin miners. For readers unfamiliar with the crypto world, the hash rate measures the processing power of a cryptocurrency network. It indicates how many calculations per second can be performed to validate transactions and secure the blockchain. In simple terms, a higher hash rate means a Bitcoin miner is better positioned to mine more Bitcoin from the blockchain. The leading hash rate of MARA is reflected in the average number of Bitcoin mined per day. MARA produced an average of 22.9 BTC/Day in Q2, compared with 14.8 for CleanSpark and 9.27 for RIOT. The above data points prove, in my view, how MARA has the best technical equipment and mining efficiency among publicly listed, US-based Bitcoin miners. While there might be privately owned Bitcoin miners outside of the US that have better hash rates - notably in Southeast Asia - these are not accessible to investors and are therefore outside the scope of this article. While there is no doubt in my mind that Marathon Digital Holdings is an excellent choice for investors interested in Bitcoin miners, the real question is whether investing in this Bitcoin miner makes sense. Should investors rather opt for simply holding Bitcoin? This is the question I will try to answer in the following sections of this article. MARA or Bitcoin? The market has many variables to consider. In evaluating whether or not MARA represents an efficient - and potentially better - alternative to holding Bitcoin, I found numerous variables to be considered. I will go through them in this section of the article. Before doing that, however, I want to start with a historical comparison between the company's stock performance and that of Bitcoin. This comparison proves, in my view, how the market has been puzzled about how to price MARA for the last few years. MARA vs. BTC performance, past 5 years (Seeking Alpha) For the better part of the last 5 years, MARA overperformed Bitcoin. That overperformance mostly happened during the 2021 Bitcoin bull run, with MARA correcting back to Bitcoin's performance during the following bear market. MARA vs. BTC performance, past 6 years (Seeking Alpha) Interestingly in my view, the situation drastically reverses if we extend the time horizon to 6 years. Taking into consideration data from 2018, the previous bull run of Bitcoin, MARA has vastly underperformed Bitcoin itself. Most of Bitcoin's overperformance happened through the crypto bear run of 2019 and 2020. The reasons behind this apparent difficulty of the market in pricing MARA have to do, in my view, with the company variable and projected Bitcoin holdings, its heavy shareholders' dilution, and its attempts at diversification. These are all elements I will cover in the next paragraphs, starting with its market valuation. MARA's valuation vs. its Bitcoin holdings: is it justified? Marathon Digital Holdings has 18,536 Bitcoins as of July 3rd, 2024. At the time of writing, following a steep correction in BTC, the company has a market capitalization of just above $5 Billion, with its Bitcoin holdings worth just below $1 Billion. I believe it is fair that MARA trades at a significant premium against its mere Bitcoin holdings. The company is a leading Bitcoin miner, and therefore I think the market should discount the future value of Bitcoin the company will mine over time. Estimating the amount of Bitcoin that MARA will ""extract"" from the blockchain in the future is no straightforward task. This ultimately depends on the relative strength of MARA as a Bitcoin miner against all other Bitcoin miners on the blockchain. While MARA is currently a leader in the space, new entrants with better hash rates might come into play - especially if Bitcoin sees increasing adoption, including from governments and financial institutions. I will attempt to calculate the worth of MARA's future Bitcoin production by taking the latest post-halving numbers reported by the company and considering the effect of upcoming Bitcoin halvings on its operations. MARA produced 22.9 Bitcoin on average per day in Q2, following the Bitcoin halving in April. In the same period of 2023, MARA produced 32.2 Bitcoin on average per day, marking a 32% decrease. Given the above data points, I am making the following assumptions to assess MARA's future Bitcoin production and its fair market value at current Bitcoin prices: MARA will produce roughly 20 Bitcoins per day until the next halving in April 2028. After 2028, I assume MARA's production will decrease by 40% for each subsequent halving event. This 40% figure is based on MARA's historical performance and the company maintaining its leadership as a miner, which would offset the halving's -50% impact on Bitcoin rewards. For simplicity, I assume MARA's relative strength against other miners will remain unchanged. With the above assumptions, I expect MARA to produce ~27,000 Bitcoins until the 2028 halving (20 BTC per day, multiplied by 1349 days until mid-April 2028). I then expect the company to produce ~16,000, ~9700, ~ 5700, ~3500, and ~2100 Bitcoins for the following 5 five halvings (ending in 2048). The total value of the roughly 64,000 Bitcoins I estimate MARA will produce is worth $3.3 Billion at current market prices. Adding the roughly $1 Billion worth of Bitcoin that MARA currently holds, as well as an additional $100 Million worth of Bitcoin that MARA plans to purchase, we have a total value of Bitcoin of $4.5 Billion - a figure that is close to MARA's current market capitalization of $5 Billion. In other words, the current market capitalization of MARA reflects the value of all the Bitcoins MARA holds, plans to hold, and will mine until 2048-and then some. Given that MARA is a Bitcoin miner, I believe its market valuation should be justified exclusively by the Bitcoin it holds and is expected to produce. In this context, I think MARA's valuation is currently fair, presenting a premium of around 10% against my calculation. However, I think it's worth noting that extrapolating figures until 2048 is a perilous task, as many things can change over such a long time span. In this regard, I believe investing in MARA presents an inherent risk, as it assumes the company will continue to be a leader in its industry for the foreseeable future. MARA is diluting shareholders, and not necessarily for the right reasons A key reason against holding MARA instead of Bitcoin concerns shareholders' dilution. The company has very generous stock-based compensation and has historically relied on issuing new stock to sustain its business. In the 3 months ended on June 30th, 2024, MARA issued roughly $80 Million in common stocks to cover for stock-based compensation. The company overall raised $834 Million from issuance of common stock during the same quarter. This figure compares with a Net Income of $137 Million. These quarterly figures pale against the $100 Million the company has announced it plans to invest in Bitcoin for long-term holding. It is also the reason why, in my view, management's strategy to diversify MARA as a Bitcoin ""HODL"" play -something I will cover in the next section - is not strong enough to change the fundamental investment narrative for this company. I understand MARA does not want to sell its Bitcoin holdings to finance itself. At the same time, I think its heavy reliance on shareholders' dilution - including for rewarding employees - is one of the strongest arguments against holding this company. MARA Shares Outstanding, past 5 years (Companiesmarketcap.com) Perhaps the most convincing data point to illustrate just how reliant on dilution MARA is, is its history of shares outstanding. The company had only ~ 6.5 Million shares outstanding in 2020, and it currently has over 290 Million shares. This represents a 44X increase in the number of shares in less than five years. ""Diworsification"" and a possible attempt at copying MicroStrategy's playbook A further element that I believe blurs the fundamental investment thesis for MARA, is management's recently announced strategy of diversification. The company is diversifying its core business in two ways. First, they have started to mine Kaspa , another cryptocurrency, in Q2 this year. Kaspa is a relatively recent cryptocurrency, introduced in 2022. In a nutshell, Kaspa proposes to be an alternative to Ethereum, based on a proof-of-work protocol. The second way MARA is diversifying its core mining business is by committing to buying $100 Million in Bitcoin, in order to adopt a full ""HODL"" strategy. In management's own words: Adopting a full HODL strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term value of bitcoin [...] We believe bitcoin is the world's best treasury reserve asset and support the idea of sovereign wealth funds holding it. We encourage governments and corporations to all hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset. I see two issues with this diversification strategy. First, the two legs of this strategy seem to be at odds with each other. If MARA is committed to Bitcoin and to ""HODL"", why then mine a relatively unknown cryptocurrency? If MARA's management truly was confident about the long-term value of Bitcoin, deploying more resources - and perhaps a better strategy - to purchase more Bitcoin over time would be more coherent with their thinking, in my opinion. The second reason why I do not like this diversification strategy is that I do not see a $100 Million one-off purchase as radical enough of a commitment. I have already covered how this figure pales against the more than $800 Million that MARA raised by issuing common stocks in Q2 alone. I would have preferred management focus on increasing its Bitcoin per share and providing investors with a stronger case for holding MARA against Bitcoin. Overall, I think MARA would benefit from a clearer positioning as a Bitcoin thought leader. In this regard, I see MARA's diversification strategy as an attempt at copying MicroStrategy. MicroStrategy, which I covered in an article a few months ago, positions itself as a ""Bitcoin development company."" The investment thesis for MSTR is fairly straightforward: the company aims to increase its BTC per share by strategically issuing new shares, cashing out the premium against its Bitcoin holdings. This contrasts with an investment thesis for MARA that is clouded by continued shareholder dilution to sustain operations and an unclear strategic positioning on whether MARA should be considered a miner or an alternative to Bitcoin itself. A remark about the secular performance of Gold Miners Investors seeing Bitcoin as a long-term hold might be interested in a comparison against the performance of gold and gold mining companies. While there are significant differences between the gold and Bitcoin mining industries, there are also similarities. Most notably in my view, economies of scale exist in both industries: both Bitcoin and gold miners are more efficient in ""extracting"" either asset, the larger and better equipped they are. Gold Mining vs. Gold Mining stocks, 20 years comparison (Visualcapitalist) Historically, gold miners have overperformed gold since the early 2000s, up until the mid-2010s. Since then, the gap between gold and its miners has widened until it reached a record earlier this year. I believe making parallels between gold and Bitcoin might be a bit too premature as Bitcoin still represents less than 10% of the market capitalization of gold. Despite this, I think the comparison with gold miners might still be helpful to remind investors that even for a much more established asset class, miners can behave very erratically compared to their underlying asset. I think this is something investors should consider when evaluating whether to enter an investment in Bitcoin miners for the long term. Risks to my thesis - market volatility and a high Bitcoin average mining cost MARA remains a highly volatile stock, and investors interested in short-term bets or actively trading Bitcoin might benefit from trading MARA rather than Bitcoin itself, given its higher volatility. Furthermore, the market might continue to assign a premium to MARA against its Bitcoin current and projected holdings. This might be especially true in the context of a Bitcoin bull market given how, historically, MARA has significantly outperformed Bitcoin in times of bull market. This latter risk might also materialize if management decided to go all-in with a Bitcoin ""HODL"" strategy and lessen the reliance of the company on shareholder dilution. In other words, the main risk to my thesis is that the market might continue to ""like"" MARA more than Bitcoin, no matter if I find its investment narrative unconvincing. Finally, there is also a risk that MARA might perform well in a sustained Bitcoin bear market. The average cost for mining Bitcoin at the moment is more than $75,000, above Bitcoin's all-time high. In case the price of Bitcoin were to stay below its ATH for months or even years, smaller Bitcoin miners might go bankrupt and leave the blockchain. In this scenario, MARA would benefit by being one of the most resilient miners, given its dimensions and efficiencies. The less miners there are on the Bitcoin blockchain, the more rewards for each remaining miner, such as MARA. While a prolonged Bitcoin bear market would hardly be good news for any crypto-related stock, I think this is a risk worth noting as it specifically concerns MARA being a leading Bitcoin miner. Conclusion In writing this article, I have not focused on whether or not entering a bet on MARA and/or Bitcoin makes sense at current price levels. Rather, I have focused on understanding whether investing in this leading Bitcoin miner could be more beneficial than investing directly in Bitcoin. Investing in MARA means entering a historically highly shareholder-dilutive company, with a premium against its Bitcoin holdings (present and expected) that the market has valued very differently over time. Another issue, in my opinion, is the company's relatively weak attempts at diversification, leaving some room for concern over management's direction. This, in my view, is in stark contrast to an investment in Bitcoin or MicroStrategy, which have a far clearer, albeit still risky, investment thesis. Ultimately, I think there are too many variables at play when it comes to an investment thesis for MARA. For these reasons, I rate MARA a HOLD. If you already have MARA in your portfolio, I see no reason for selling it, as the company might very well perform in line with or even better than Bitcoin based on historical data. However, I see no reason to recommend investors interested in Bitcoin to buy MARA instead of simply buying a Bitcoin ETF.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4711602-marathon-digital-too-many-variables-at-play?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32142336.jpeg

32141437,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633738,1723050032,Arthur Hayes Reveals How To Trade Crypto Amid The ‘Dollar-Yen Death March’,"In his latest essay “Spirited Away,” Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, dives into the complexities of the global financial markets, with a focus on the impending unwinding of the dollar-yen carry trade and its impact on the crypto market. Hayes begins by discussing the potential actions of the US Vice President Kamala Harris in response to an impending financial crisis, influenced by her need to secure electoral victory. He predicts, “Harris will instruct Yellen to use the monetary tools available to her to avert a financial crisis,” suggesting an immediate response to stabilize the markets expected “no later than the opening of Asian trading next Monday, August 12th.” Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Believes The Crypto Crash Sets The Stage For Bitcoin To Thrive – Key Reasons Why The analysis revolves around the ‘yen carry trade,’ where Japan Inc. borrows yen at low rates to invest in higher-yielding foreign assets. This trade has been massively profitable due to the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) policies that keep yen liabilities low and asset returns high, facilitated by a weak yen. However, Hayes points out the vulnerabilities of this strategy: “If the BOJ ceases its bond purchases, the unwinding could lead to significant yen appreciation and a corresponding decline in global equity markets.” Hayes outlines the potential dire consequences of a sudden strengthening of the yen, predicting drastic impacts on global stock markets. He quantifies these impacts, stating, “If the dollar-yen reached 100, a 38% move, the Nasdaq would drop to ~12,600 and the Nikkei to ~25,365,” indicating severe repercussions for global financial stability. According to the former BitMEX CEO, the full unwind of the dollar-yen carry trade is a question of when, not if. “The question is when the Fed and Treasury will print money to blunt its effects on Pax Americana,” he adds and describes a scenario where the US equity markets could crash into this upcoming Friday. “Then some sort of action over the weekend is probable,” according to Hayes. He further theorizes on a more long-term scenario: “If the yen starts to weaken again, the crisis is over in the immediate term. The unwind will continue, albeit at a slower pace. I believe the markets will throw another tantrum between September and November as the dollar-yen pair resumes its death march toward 100. There will definitely be a response this time around, as the US presidential election will be weeks or days away.” How To Trade Crypto In This Environment Hayes describes the situation as complex due to two conflicting liquidity forces. “Trading this in a crypto fashion is difficult. Two opposing forces influence my crypto positioning,” he states. First, there is the “Liquidity Positive Force”. This force emerges from the US Treasury’s potential actions, which could inject significant dollar liquidity into the market. Hayes notes, “After a quarter of net restrictive policy, the US Treasury will net inject dollar liquidity because it will issue Treasury bills and possibly deplete the Treasury General Account.” This influx of liquidity could buoy markets, including cryptocurrencies, by providing more capital for investment. Related Reading: Why The 4-Year Crypto Cycle Is A Thing Of The Past: Top-Analyst Conversely, the strengthening of the yen (“Liquidity Negative Force”), driven by the unwinding of the carry trade, would necessitate a global sell-off of financial assets as higher yen costs make debt servicing more expensive. This force could lead to a withdrawal of liquidity from markets, exerting downward pressure on asset prices, including cryptocurrencies. Hayes proposes that the interplay of these forces will dictate the behavior of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. He categorizes potential outcomes into two scenarios: Convex-Bitcoin Scenario: In this scenario, Bitcoin could rise in value regardless of whether the dollar-yen pair strengthens or weakens, indicating that the market expects a bailout if the yen strengthens and that the liquidity provided by the US Treasury is sufficient to counteract the negative impacts. Correlated-Bitcoin Scenario: Here, Bitcoin’s price movements would align closely with traditional financial markets. A strengthening yen would lead to a fall in Bitcoin prices, and a weakening yen would result in a rise, mirroring the liquidity shifts in traditional finance. “If the setup is convex-Bitcoin, I will aggressively add positions as we have reached the local bottom. If the setup is correlated-Bitcoin, then I will sit on the sidelines and wait for the eventual market capitulation. The mega assumption is that the BOJ will not reverse course, cut deposit rates back to 0%, and resume unlimited JGB purchases. If the BOJ sticks by the plan it laid out at its last meeting, the carry trade unwind will continue,” Hayes concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $57,200.

Tokenized short-term liquidity funds have found product-market fit across institutions, Web 3.0 investment firms, blockchain foundations, and other crypto-native organizations this year. Six products each reached $100-plus million and one reached the $500 million mark in July 2024, eclipsing $2 billion in collective flows.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Protocols are electing to diversify their own treasury holdings into real-world assets, with Ethereum Layer-2 Arbitrumdeploying $27 million in ARB tokens into BlackRock’s BUIDL, Ondo Finance’s USDY, and products offered by Superstate, OpenEden, Backed Finance, and Mountain Protocol. MakerDAO opened theSpark Tokenization Grand Prix competition to tokenize and integrate $1 billion in real-world assets. Meanwhile, synthetic dollar protocol developerEthena Labs is exploring allocating a portion of its $280 million stablecoin holdings and reserve fund to yield-generating real-world assets.  Prime brokers, market makers, and custodians have also been enjoying the benefits of professionally-managed liquidity products providing pass-through yield where existing stablecoins would not. One good example is prime brokerFalconX accepting BlackRock’s USD Institutional Digital Liquidty Fund (BUIDL) as collateral for trading and swap positions from clients. That’s an immediate value-add for FalconX, its clients, and Securitize as the tokenized fund issuance platform alike. More FalconX clients will likely elect to swap stablecoin and cash holdings into BUIDL for the on-chain yield, which will drive additional capital and participants from the digital asset realm towards the Securitize ecosystem. As detailed inApril 2024, onboarding capital to tokenization platforms through short-term liquidity funds is paramount to tokenized alternative assets seeing success.  Web 3.0 organizations and asset managers will begin shifting up the risk curve and building out diversified books after finding some level of comfort with tokenized liquidity funds. Private investment funds are ripe for an unlock. Singular commercial real estate and residential real estate assets have proven to be tough sells; they concentrate risk, are not very differentiated, and generally have less velocity than investment funds geared towards the same asset class.  Contrast that with the $14 trillion residential mortgage space and associated Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR). Residential MSR have clocked an estimated $1 trillion in annual secondary trading volume during each of the last four years running through venues like Blue Water. Token-focused investors are typically seeking two-sided liquidity, an active market, and underlying asset velocity. Bringing an existing two-sided market to the tokenization space will alleviate current industry pain points, offering something attractive to the nearly $2 billion in liquidity fund capital that resides on-chain. As such, Blue Water sits as that bridge between digital asset capital markets and the ever-active mortgage industry.

42424697,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHVybh,1723047380,How DePIN Can Modernize Car Insurance,"Passing my driving test at 18 gave me a sense of great freedom. But, as I considered buying a car, the thrill was dented by the cost of car insurance. Because I was a new driver, I was seen as high-risk by insurers and my quote was exorbitant. I felt it was unfair to be evaluated as a driver based on the perception of the cohort I belonged to.  It's unfair to generalise and deem an entire group of drivers as dangerous due to grouping factors. Exceptional drivers exist in every age group and category, and insurance fees should reflect individual driving skills, not the driving skills of the group that one belongs to. To ensure fairness, we should focus on how individual drivers perform rather than the group they fall in, and DePIN will help us achieve this.  Although this feeling of injustice didn’t lead me directly to founding a Layer-1 blockchain for DePIN applications, the impact DePIN is already having on the automotive industry inspired me to consider how the concept could be utilised to make car insurance fairer.  The problem with current vehicle insurance  The current vehicle insurance industry builds risk profiles based on generalisations about the driving behaviour of all drivers. This approach often penalises members of an entire cohort based on the actions of a few, leading to disproportionately high premiums across the board.  The upshot is that motor insurance premiums are rising, even on the cheapest cars. The cost of insurance increased by 25 per cent in 2023, following a 50 per cent hike the year before, yet insurers still claim to be spending more on claims and costs than they’re raking in via premiums, and younger drivers are the most affected by this.  This approach is inherently unfair because it fails to account for individual driving behaviours and circumstances. For example, a young driver who practices safe driving habits and has no history of accidents is still lumped into a high-risk category simply due to age. This lack of personalisation penalizes good drivers and discourages safe driving practices, as they see no direct benefit from their responsible behaviour.  I asked myself: Is this all fair? But, more importantly, how can we solve this problem?  DePIN is a game-changer  The concept of DePIN aims to create decentralized infrastructures that empower end-users by providing more affordable services. A unique use case of DePIN is that it enables each participant in an ecosystem to collect and contribute data to the network and be paid for their data.  Using data assigned to individual users but preserving their privacy through blockchain cryptography and DePIN data sharing, enables insurers to develop more accurate assessments of driving risk for specific driverss. Unlike traditional methods that rely on broad assumptions, DePIN allows for a nuanced understanding of individual driving behaviours.  At the heart of this revolution is the “DePIN Data Logger,” a cutting-edge device that can be attached to a car to acquire data directly from a car's sensors. This logger captures multiple metrics such as speed, break reaction time and more, that can help companies analyse the overall behaviour of drivers.  A DePIN Data Logger is set to transform vehicle insurance by enabling a “pay-as-you-drive” model. Drivers can securely log their data anonymously, using an unique personal ID, which grants access to sharing their data and pay the insurance at the end of each journey. This system ensures that the necessary data for risk assessment and insurance calculation is collected without compromising the driver's identity or specific journey details.  By collecting detailed driving data, such as speed, braking patterns, and reaction times, insurers can develop a nuanced understanding of drivers’ behaviour. This data-driven method moves away from broad generalizations and offers a more equitable solution for determining insurance premiums.  The DePIN focus on privacy means that while comprehensive data is utilized for improving insurance accuracy, the drivers’ personal information remains secure. Drivers can enjoy the benefits of personalized insurance without fear of their movements being tracked or their data being misused. Additionally, by opting in, drivers can be paid for the data that they choose to share with third-party providers for uses beyond insurance, such as with car manufacturers, mechanics and parts providers.  The road ahead  The potential benefits of a data-driven approach are supported by various studies and data points: A report by McKinsey & Company highlights that telematics-based insurance products can result in more accurate pricing, reduced claims costs, and improved customer satisfaction.  Furthermore, data from the European Commission indicates that the implementation of telematics in vehicle insurance can reduce accident rates by up to 20%, as drivers become more aware of their driving habits and adjust their behaviour accordingly. These findings underscore the potential of DePIN to create a fairer and more efficient vehicle insurance system.  While the benefits of DePIN in vehicle insurance (e.g. where an automotive DePIN partners with an insurance provider) are clear, some challenges and considerations need to be addressed. One of the primary concerns is data privacy. Ensuring that the data collected by DePIN Data Loggers is used responsibly and securely is paramount.  To overcome this issue, you need a Layer-1 blockchain that is fully decentralized and device agnostic. An architecture where each user (node) retains control over their own transactions. This decentralized model ensures that users' data remains within their own custody, aligning with regulatory frameworks such as the EU’s GDPR privacy law.  Users have the ability to operate as full node operators, maintaining control over the data they contribute, as it’s stored locally on their own vehicle. This setup ensures their privacy and autonomy. When and if they choose to sell their car, they simply remove the access rights associated with their private key / password, and their data remains encrypted and no longer accessible.  As the DePIN narrative continues to gain traction, insurers are expected to embrace this technology and develop its potential. By doing so, they can create a fairer and more efficient system that rewards safe drivers and reduces the financial burden on those who are unjustly penalised under current models.

42390661,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd51K1,1723046726,Preparing for DeFi Regulation: The Role of Portable KYC,"The global cryptocurrency regulatory landscape has evolved rapidly over the past few years, and this swift pace of regulatory rulemaking is unlikely to slow down anytime soon. Lawmakers are increasingly shifting their focus from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and applications (dApps).  The passage of MICA legislation in the EU is already putting pressure on DeFI firms to start KYCing their users due to the fact that only ""truly decentralized"" projects are exempt from MICA when in reality most DeFi applications do have an organization or individual ultimately controlling them. Additionally, the EU commission has a target date of EOY 2024 to produce their full report on the risks and recommendations for DeFI. In the U.S., the SEC has started an enforcement action against the largest DEX in the world, Uniswap.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  As the number of DeFi participants increases (as illustrated in the chart below), regulators are becoming more focused on DeFi space. While the exact nature of future legislation remains uncertain, it is safe to assume that the basic principles of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) will become applicable to DeFi.     Regulated institutions typically follow a standardized KYC framework to meet their regulatory requirements:  Establish the customer’s identity through documentary or non-documentary means (Customer Identification Program/CIP).  Assess customer risk by scanning against sanctions, Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), adverse media lists, customer occupation, expected activity, etc.  Ongoing monitoring for subsequent inclusion on AML watchlists, adverse media lists, spikes in activity, etc.  Currently, all three steps of the KYC process are repeated at every institution where an individual holds an account. This requires individuals to submit the same documentation and information multiple times. Since opening a new bank account is not a frequent activity, the inconvenience of repeated KYC is generally not acutely felt by customers. In DeFi, however, someone might interact with ten or 15 protocols a day. Requiring individuals to complete KYC multiple times causes frustration and turns DeFi into a digital version of the traditional financial system.  There’s an alternative: portable KYC.  DApps now have a unique opportunity to implement this, both in the current largely unregulated environment and, in the future, when DeFi-specific AML/KYC regulations are enacted. In a regulation-free setting, public blockchain technology allows users to submit their identification documents, have their names screened against AML watchlists, have their on-chain activity scanned for AML risk, and store proof of each check in their wallet. Users can then interact with permissioned dApps, whose smart contracts can filter out those who have not passed the KYC checks.  This method is advantageous for individuals, who do not need to endure the friction of repeatedly submitting documentation. It also offers significant benefits for dApps, ensuring they don’t run the risk of violating sanctions and money laundering rules, while saving money on compliance personnel and systems, and providing resistance to sybil attacks..  DApps subject to AML/KYC regulations can use portable KYC to satisfy aspects of their regulatory obligations similarly to unregulated dApps. However, regulated dApps will need full access to their customers’ underlying documentation to make onboarding decisions. While customer documentation cannot be stored on a public blockchain, regulated entities are permitted to engage service providers to assist in fulfilling their AML/KYC obligations. Therefore, portable KYC service providers can store and transmit the customer documentation to the entity, enabling it to decide whether to onboard the user.  The coming shift towards regulated DeFi protocols underscores the need for innovative compliance solutions. Portable KYC offers a practical approach to balance user convenience and regulatory demands, enabling dApps to reduce compliance costs and mitigate risks. By preparing now, DeFi organizations can ensure a smooth transition into a more regulated future, fostering trust and resilience within the ecosystem.

42390653,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd50ez,1723044699,"Hong Kong Digital Bank Mox Adds Crypto ETFs, Plans Direct Crypto Investing","Digital bank Mox, a subsidiary of Standard Chartered, has started offering crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to its customers.  It is also planning on offering direct crypto investments in the future.  Mox is one of several banks offering crypto ETFs in Hong Kong, differentiating itself by charging a lower fee.  Mox, a virtual bank subsidiary of Standard Chartered, has started offering bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to its clients shortly after launching an investment platform in Hong Kong, the company announced Wednesday.  The bank also plans to offer direct crypto investments on its platform through a partnership with a licensed exchange, it told the South China Morning Post. So far, only two exchanges, HashKey and OSL, are licensed to offer crypto trading in Hong Kong.  “Adding Crypto ETFs to the Mox Invest platform empowers our customers to gain access to emerging asset classes with confidence, allowing them to explore new investment opportunities within the evolving crypto ecosystem in a regulated and trusted environment and through a safe and simple way via the Mox app,” CEO Barbaros Uygun said in a statement.  While the crypto ETFs are already available to investors on other trading platforms, Mox charges a lower fee of 0.12% of transaction volume with a minimum of HK$30 ($3.85) for Hong Kong-listed ETFs and 0.01% with a minimum of $5 for U.S.-listed ETFs. This is the cheapest among banks in the area, Henry Lau, Mox's head of investment, told the SCMP.  U.S.-listed spot bitcoin and ether ETFs have gained traction since their introduction earlier this year, with the bitcoin ETFs taking in over $17 billion inflows since January. The spot ether ETFs, which started up in July, have seen a net $364 million of outflows resulting from investors pulling money out of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, according to data from Farside Investors.

Tron is touted as a “silent giant”, boasting a whopping $1.4 billion in revenue over the past year. This is because of the platform’s significant investment in stablecoins, thus propping their stablecoin activity just behind Ethereum, the second-most prominent blockchain in the world. Another development that will increase stablecoin activity on the platform is TokenPocket, a crypto wallet provider, introducing a feature that uses Tether (USDT) to pay gas fees on TRX, providing convenience for users who want to use Tron despite not holding any of the token itself. ✅Use $USDT to cover gas fees on the #TRON network via TokenPocket! Check out how @Cointelegraph introduces this feature! @trondao #TRON 👇https://t.co/90Kiwkc40W — TokenPocket (@TokenPocket_TP) August 3, 2024 How did this affect Tron’s position in the market? Well, the answer lies in the ever-growing stats that show a strong and growing community in the long run. According to Tron’s official website, the platform has processed over $8 billion in transactions with a whopping $19.6 billion in total value locked (TVL). Long-Term Growth Is Guaranteed At These Levels The token’s current positioning amid the bearish market is somewhat stable, settling around $0.1229 and $0.1271. TRX bears have already used this price range earlier this year which puts more pressure on the bulls to hold on to this support range for a future breakthrough. Related Reading: Aave Protocol Unfazed By Market Jitters, Surges 21% TRX moves alongside Ethereum in the same manner as ETH following Bitcoin within the broader market. This might help with the token’s future performance as the market usually follows the two top cryptocurrencies as a gauge of the broader market’s bullishness or bearishness. As Bitcoin’s rebound slows to a crawl, TRX might face difficulties in achieving a breakthrough in the short term. However, this does not discredit the possibility of a bullish breakthrough in the mid to late August timeline which might be the time Bitcoin and Ethereum already recovers from the market overreaction this week. However, the market’s current volatile nature also may hamper any further attempt at short-term upward movement. The bulls should then continue holding on the $0.1229-$0.1271 price range to ensure a strong breakthrough in the long-term.

42390652,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd50Zr,1723043896,Crypto PAC Fairshake Claims Another Win Against Elizabeth Warren Ally With Bush Loss,"The digital assets industry's Fairshake PAC is chalking up three victories in this week's congressional primaries.  Crypto spending has helped defeat a number of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's congressional allies, including prominent progressive Rep. Cori Bush in Missouri.  Fairshake said it's securing advertising time in 18 general-election contests, where it'll spend $25 million on its picks for Congress.  The crypto industry has devoted a seven-digit war chest to opposing candidates backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and that spending may have contributed to some sitting lawmakers losing their jobs, according to the leading political action committee (PAC) funded by digital assets firms.  Bush, a prominent House of Representatives progressive, lost her primary battle to Wesley Bell, a Democratic prosecuting attorney, by a wide margin after anti-Bush forces began spending millions on opposition ads – easily outpacing the money her campaign raised from supporters. Crypto opposition – despite the hefty $1.4 million price tag from its Fairshake super PAC – was overshadowed by a massive, $9 million anti-Bush campaign from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which spent several million dollars to derail Bush in this week's primary.  ""Cori Bush has now become the latest anti-crypto, Elizabeth Warren-endorsed lawmaker to lose their seat in Congress,"" said Josh Vlasto, a Fairshake spokesman, in a statement. ""The crypto and blockchain community will continue to support candidates who believe in innovation and job creation.""  This echoed the similar playbook to the earlier campaign against Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.), which also drew a big-money response from the pro-Israel lobbying group in addition to a lesser (but still significant) opposition spending from the crypto sector.  Also in Tuesday primaries, Fairshake and its affiliates chalked up two victories of its hand-picked, pro-crypto candidates in Washington state and a different Missouri race.  In Washington state, the PACs spent $1.5 million to support Democrat Emily Randall in the 6th Congressional District, where she won in the state's top-two primary system. So, she'll face the second-highest vote winner in the general election, though she exceeded that Republican's vote total by more than 3,000 and would be expected to win.  In Missouri's 3rd Congressional District, the crypto PACs spent money to support Bob Onder, a Republican state senator, who won the Republican primary handily in a district that's expected to favor the Republican in the November elections.  That makes 26 U.S. congressional races in which the crypto industry has prevailed in either getting its pick or in opposing a candidate that the sector's hired political guns saw as a threat to the digital assets space. Sen. Warren and her allies have been a theme of the 2024 crypto spending – which has been outpacing most other U.S. industries. The most prominent example was the $10 million devoted to defeating Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) in her bid for the U.S. Senate. More recently, in Arizona's 3rd Congressional District, crypto pick Yassamin Ansari, a Democratic former vice mayor of Phoenix who has been a digital assets advocate, retains a 42-vote lead in her race (now heading for automatic recount) against a Warren-backed opponent.  With the U.S. congressional primaries soon winding to a close, Fairshake has set its sights on general-election contests. The PAC announced on Wednesday that it's beginning to secure advertising time in 18 districts, planning for about $25 million in spending.  “We will continue to deploy our resources in support of leaders on both sides of the aisle and in both houses who are committed to getting things done and working with the industry to pass responsible regulation that drives innovation, creates jobs, and sustains America’s global leadership,” Vlasto said in a statement.

42390656,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd50uN,1723043689,DePIN Data Verification: A Challenge With no Silver Bullets,"At times, all it takes to defeat a high-tech solution is something as low-tech as a piece of bubble gum. You see, certain goods — mostly food products such as fish or dairy — have to be transported at a specific temperature. Companies set up sensors in delivery trucks to keep track of that, but drivers, who can get fined for mishandled shipments, aren’t fans of those. So some of them just put chewing gum on the sensors, which makes sensor readings invalid.  In a data-dependent decentralized environment like DePIN, malicious actors can mess with the system as easily as the drivers in this anecdote, which comes from an industry partner of ours. And the consequences can be a lot more dire than a food poisoning, potentially bringing entire projects down. So how should builders handle DePIN data verification? That’s a question we took to heart when working on peaq, the layer-1 for DePIN.  Data makes DePIN go round  First, let’s take a moment to fully grasp the issue at hand. In essence, it comes down to two things: data being crucial for DePINs to function — and their incentive model inviting potential abuse.  On the data side, there is an entire segment of DePINs that are fully focused on crowd-sourcing data. Silencio Network collects data on noise pollution, MapMetrics collects navigation data, WeatherXM, as shocking as that is, collects weather data, and so on and so forth. For all of these projects, data is their product; it is what they offer to the demand side, enterprises, researchers, and everyone in between. As such, quality data is crucial for their ability to consistently reward users sharing it, which is a key part of the DePIN flywheel enabling projects to scale.  That said, DePIN data verification matters even if data isn’t the core product. Let’s take a DePIN for electric vehicle charging, for example. The charging session is obviously an off-chain event, and the DePIN needs data to charge the buyer for the session and reward the provider for it. More specifically, it needs such variables as the vehicle and chargepoint IDs, the duration of the session, the amount of electricity consumed, et cetera.  In both cases, data and rewards ultimately go hand in hand: If you provide the right data, you get the tokens. Most people will do exactly that, playing by the rules. However, a small amount of bad actors might decide to spice things up — and spoil the meal for everyone.  Fake it till you break it  Here is the problem: Data can be spoofed, or forged, in non-techie terms. The chewing gum story very much applies, but here’s another entertaining examples — remember Pokemon Go? Well, there’s an entire subreddit on spoofing your location in the game, enabling you to catch a Pikachu or two from the comfort of your sofa. In a scenario where a DePIN offers increased rewards for data from a specific location, you could use the same principles to spoof the location of your sensors and earn more tokens for providing, well, garbage data. By the same account, a chargepoint that’s not really there will probably entertain the prankster who put it on the map, but not the driver whose electric vehicle was just about to run out of juice.  From the DePIN’s perspective, such spoofing is pretty abysmal. If the DePIN’s whole product is data, spoofing is poisoning its well, making its datasets less valuable. In the short term, this means fewer happy customers, in the long term, it could kill off the demand side and bring the project down. With non data-centric DePINs, fake activity cuts into the reward pools for honest participants and can enable real-world crime.  The catch is, though, that Web3’s ethos demands DePINs to be open for anyone to join, with no centralized device checkups. At the same time, DePINs must operate trustlessly, featuring baked-in mechanisms for filtering out malicious actors at every step.  So what is the ultimate DePIN data verification solution? Well… There’s none.  No silver bullets  The simple truth is, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions here. The reason for that is quite simple: DePINs are very diverse, they dive into hundreds of industries and leverage thousands of device types. This means that any sort of device-level uniform controls can only be enforced if a DePIN works exclusively on proprietary hardware. The strategy is not illegitimate, but comes at the expense of openness, while also introducing a centralized point of failure into the project — the device manufacturer.  The good news is that we don’t need a one-size-fits-all solution. We can rather mix and match various approaches and build decentralized networks with multi-level safeguards. Using the devices’ private keys to sign all the data they broadcast at the source is a good device-agnostic first step that allows us to track the data to its source and thus weed out malicious actors post-factum. However, the device needs to be able to sign transactions for that to work, and that also takes specialized software. And, of course, the dutifully and correctly signed data might still be wrong if there’s chewing gum involved.  Machine learning is another handy data verification tool, seeking out abnormalities in the data coming in from the devices. This approach benefits from the very network effect that makes a DePIN — the more data sources you have, the more on-point your estimates of the underlying pattern will be — and flags anything that doesn’t fit into it. Granted, an anomaly might not always be the result of malicious activities, though, which is why DePINs would also benefit from using data oracles as well. These oracles would provide another benchmark for the DePIN to compare the data against, further boosting its ability to weed out malicious actors.  When working in tandem, all of these solutions provide us with a toolbox that allows DePIN builders to create the suitable data verification solution for their specific case, making the DePIN data trustworthy. That, in turn, is a crucial step toward wider DePIN adoption across the board, from enterprises in need of quality data and services to everyday people.  So, while DePIN data verification will always take some customization, the value of getting it right will be as huge as the downside for getting it wrong.

32136244,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633841,1723041643,Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe Rival Coins That Are Dominating The Market With Massive Gains,"In the fast-paced world of cryptocurrency, Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) have emerged as standout contenders, each making significant strides with impressive gains. As the crypto market evolves, these two meme coins are capturing attention with their unique attributes and substantial growth. Let’s explore why Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are currently dominating the market and how they are reshaping the future of digital assets. Pepecoin (PEPE): A Trailblazer in Meme Coins Pepecoin (PEPE) has established itself as a notable player in the meme coin arena, primarily due to its innovative approach to meme culture and community engagement. The coin has gained considerable traction by leveraging the viral nature of internet memes. Pepecoin (PEPE) has successfully integrated meme culture into its framework, capitalizing on the popularity of the Pepecoin (PEPE) meme to create a unique investment opportunity. This alignment with internet culture has helped it attract a dedicated following of investors and enthusiasts. The coin’s growth is largely attributed to its strong community. Driven by active participation and engagement, Pepecoin (PEPE) has used its fan base to boost its market presence and value. The community’s dedication has played a crucial role in its success. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A New Contender with Innovative DeFi Features Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new entrant in the cryptocurrency market, is making waves with its impressive performance and forward-thinking features. Priced attractively, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly gained attention as a serious competitor to established coins like Pepecoin (PEPE). One of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s standout features is its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. By incorporating elements such as yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers more than just a meme coin experience. These DeFi functionalities provide significant value and utility, setting Mpeppe (MPEPE) apart from traditional meme coins. Mpeppe (MPEPE) enhances its appeal by offering a wide range of financial services within the DeFi ecosystem. This includes lending, borrowing, and trading opportunities, all without traditional intermediaries. This added functionality not only improves Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s utility but also positions it as a progressive force in the cryptocurrency market Pepecoin (PEPE) vs. Mpeppe (MPEPE): A Comparative Analysis Pepecoin (PEPE)’s success stems from its deep roots in meme culture and community-driven growth. However, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is pushing boundaries with its advanced DeFi capabilities. Investors are increasingly evaluating how these two rival coins compare: Pepecoin (PEPE)’s success in leveraging meme culture has led to significant gains, but Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative approach with DeFi integration offers a new kind of growth potential. While Pepecoin (PEPE) continues to thrive on its meme-based appeal, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s functionality within the DeFi space adds a layer of practical value that could attract a different segment of investors. Both coins boast strong communities, but Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s dual focus on meme culture and DeFi could engage a broader audience interested in both entertainment and practical financial applications. The combination of cultural relevance and advanced technology makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) a unique player in the market. Conclusion Pepecoin (PEPE) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are not merely competing in the meme coin sector; they are setting new benchmarks for what meme coins can achieve. Pepecoin (PEPE)’s strong community and cultural impact, combined with Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative DeFi integration, are demonstrating how meme culture and advanced technology can drive significant market gains. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, these rival coins are well-positioned to influence the future of digital finance and investment.

32135712,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633826,1723040863,Dogecoin Struggles To Compete With New 1000x Rival,"Dogecoin (DOGE), once the undisputed king of meme coins, is now facing fierce competition from a rising star: Mpeppe (MPEPE). While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a staple in the cryptocurrency market for years, recent developments indicate that Mpeppe might be the new contender capable of outshining the legendary Dogecoin (DOGE) with its potential 1000x gains. Let’s dive into the recent performance and prospects of these two cryptocurrencies. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Kid on the Block Mpeppe (MPEPE) is currently in Stage 2 of its presale, priced at 0.00107 USDT per token. The presale has already raised $589,695, with 75.26% of the total tokens sold. This rapid uptake reflects growing investor confidence and excitement about Mpeppe’s potential. With only 235,023,783 tokens remaining, the buzz around Mpeppe is palpable. Mpeppe’s success in the presale phase is a testament to its promising future. Investors are eager to get in early, anticipating massive returns as the token prepares to transition to the next stage at a higher price of 0.001777 USDT. The strong presale performance indicates that Mpeppe is well on its way to making significant waves in the crypto market. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Current Struggles Dogecoin (DOGE) is experiencing a challenging period. The live price of Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.098749 per DOGE/USD, with a market cap of $14.36 billion USD. Despite its popularity, Dogecoin has seen a decline of 0.82% in the last 24 hours, with a 24-hour trading volume of $996.73 million USD. This performance has resulted in Dogecoin slipping to the 10th position among the largest cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin’s decline is attributed to several factors, including a significant whale movement of 117.52 million DOGE worth $11 million USD to Robinhood, an American exchange. This movement sparked panic in the market, indicating a potential sell-off. Additionally, Dogecoin faced massive liquidations, with $14.74 million USD liquidated in the last 24 hours, highlighting the extreme volatility and market pressure Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently under. Market Reactions and Predictions The recent downturn has seen Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price fall below $0.08, a stark contrast to its peak of $0.14 just two weeks ago. Technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) are showing bearish momentum. The MACD is in the negative zone, and the RSI indicates that Dogecoin (DOGE) is oversold. These metrics suggest that unless there is significant buying pressure, Dogecoin may continue to struggle in the near term. In contrast, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is gaining momentum. With strong community support and a successful presale, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a serious contender in the crypto space. The token’s innovative approach and high return potential are attracting investors looking for the next big opportunity. The Future of Mpeppe (MPEPE) The optimism surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE) is driven by its unique value proposition. Unlike many meme coins, Mpeppe offers real utility through its integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) and gaming platforms. This blend of fun and functionality is attracting a diverse range of investors seeking substantial returns. Crypto analysts are bullish on Mpeppe’s potential, predicting that it could achieve up to 1000x returns. This forecast is based on Mpeppe’s innovative approach, strong community support, and the significant interest it has garnered during its presale phase. Early investors are particularly optimistic about the substantial gains they could achieve as Mpeppe continues to gain traction. For those interested in investing in Mpeppe (MPEPE), the smart contract address is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B. Ensuring the correct contract address is crucial to avoid scams and secure your investment. Conclusion While Dogecoin (DOGE) grapples with its current market challenges, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is emerging as a formidable rival with the potential to deliver massive returns. Dogecoin’s recent struggles highlight the volatility and risks inherent in the crypto market. In contrast, Mpeppe’s strong presale performance and promising future make it an attractive option for investors seeking high returns. As the crypto landscape evolves, Mpeppe is set to become a key player, possibly overshadowing the once-dominant Dogecoin. Investors looking to diversify their portfolios and capitalize on new opportunities should consider Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a viable option. With its unique value proposition and high return potential, Mpeppe could be the next big thing in the crypto world.

Block validators that are immediately downstream of a transaction are likely to cooperate, the report said, noting that sanctions may not apply to non-U.S. persons.  Ethereum block builders have largely cooperated with sanctions on Tornado Cash, despite there still being some activity with the crypto mixer, said a new report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The New York Fed published a paper on Wednesday evaluating the effect the Office of Foreign Asset Control's blacklisting of Tornado Cash had on its usage. Mixers are designed to support privacy by obfuscating the origin and destination of transactions, but law enforcement entities like OFAC have targeted several of them due to their use by illicit actors, including North Korea. The U.S. Treasury Department banned all U.S. persons from engaging with it in August 2022.  Roman Storm, one of the developers of Tornado Cash, is currently facing trial over his role in the project, with prosecutors and defense attorneys arguing over whether it is a software tool or a service. Another developer, Alexey Pertsev, was convicted in the Netherlands on similar charges earlier this year.  Wednesday's paper suggested that while block validators that are immediately downstream of a transaction are likely to cooperate – particularly after a court ruling supporting the sanctions – nodes that are further away from a transaction's origination are less likely to be cooperative.  ""To examine the impact of regulatory clarity and judicial precedent on cooperation, we exploit the timing around the court ruling in August 2023 that ruled in favor of OFAC,"" the paper said. ""We find direct evidence of large builders switching to a cooperative posture following the ruling, giving credence to the idea that clarity around regulation is a pivotal factor to determining whether to cooperate.""  Read more: Conduct Versus Code May Be the Defining Question in Roman Storm Prosecution  The paper included the caveat that it was measuring cooperation with the sanctions, but those sanctions may not apply to non-U.S. persons (defined as any citizens or residents and entities) outside of the country. In other words, non-cooperation doesn't necessarily mean anyone is using Tornado Cash in violation of the sanctions.  Still, ""the total value and volume of Tornado Cash drops precipitously"" in the sample period measured, the paper said, and just one entity was responsible for most of the blocks containing funds sent through the mixer.

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority has issued over 1,000 warnings since its financial promotion rules for crypto firms took effect last October, Lucy Castledine, the regulator's director of consumer investments, told CoinDesk.  The rules require crypto companies to be registered with the regulator in order to be able to reach out to clients in the U.K.  ""I think it is also important to point out that we will continue to act where we see firms acting illegally and to date we have issued over 1,000 warnings on unregistered crypto firms that are illegally promoting to the U.K. market,"" Castledine said in an interview.  ""So we’ve issued the alerts against those firms, and actually, our actions have already resulted in the removal of 48 apps from U.K. app stores, and we will continue to work with third parties, like social media companies, to try to get illegal websites removed and taken down as appropriate,"" Castledine said.  On Wednesday, the FCA published guidance for registered firms noting both good and poor practice.  The rules require firms to take reasonable steps to establish whether a consumer is a restricted, high-net worth or certified sophisticated investor before communicating financial promotions.  Most firms ensured customers could self-categorise themselves properly, the report said.

32134632,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633710,1723039210,Cardano Price Crash Below $0.3: Is It Time For You To Buy ADA?,"Cardano is one of the altcoins that have been significantly impacted in the crypto market crash triggered by the Bitcoin decline. However, while this could sound as the end of the road for some, others are seeing this as an opportunity to buy the cryptocurrency for cheap. One of those is crypto analyst Alan Santana, whose recent analysis points toward bullishness for the ADA price in spite of the decline. The State Of Cardano Crypto analyst Alan Santana has outlined why the Cardano altcoin could be a good buy from these prices. In the analysis posted on TradingView, Santana suggests that investing in an altcoin like Cardano should be focused on the long term rather than the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Running Out Of Coins As Dominance Hits 3-Year High The analyst pointed out that the Cardano price is currently undergoing a major correction. However, there is no cause for alarm as this decline isn’t localized to just Cardano alone. Rather, it is affecting the entire crypto market. Instead of focusing on the market decline, Santana points out that Cardano is a great project, so it is better to pay attention to what is to come. For example, the current level is a good level to begin accumulating AD coins and the Fibonacci indicator supports this. Presently, the ADA price has lost its support at the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement, which is bearish for the short term. This is because it will cause the altcoin price to actually move to its long-term support of $0.25 seen in January and October 2023. Nevertheless, this makes it a good time to start buying for long-term gains, according to the analyst. Can ADA Return To Its ATH? With the Cardano price plunge below $0.29, it is now down almost 91% from its September 2021 all-time high of $3.1. This means that the altcoin’s price will have to do a 10x to reach a new all-time high, and with the expectation of potential upside, it could make now a unique opportunity to buy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Crash Over? Veteran Trader Predicts Rebound To $90,000 On his part, crypto analyst Alan Santana expects the ADA price to reach a bottom and then bounce from $0.25. The top of the target from here lies just above $0.65, meaning that this would be a 150% increase in price from the historical support level of $0.25. Santana is not the only crypto analyst that sees upside for Cardano as another analyst Captain Fabik also expects the altcoin’s price to rise. The crypto analyst had pointed out a Falling Wedge Breakout on the chart, signaling a 70% rally for the digital asset. However, another crypto analyst Crypto Bullet believes that the ADA price will actually underperform in this bull market. While the analyst believes a price increase is possible, they do not believe that the price will reach a new all-time high this cycle.

The movement of funds, totaling approximately 2,800 ETH, was tracked from dormant wallets to a single wallet, with the origin traced back to a wallet involved in a $2 billion seizure in 2020.  Wallets tied to funds seized from the $4.2 billion PlusToken Ponzi scheme started moving thousands of ether (ETH) on Wednesday, creating chatter about more looming sell pressure among crypto market participants on X.

The ether in the previously dormant wallets was traced back to a wallet that seized $2 billion worth of ETH in 2020.

32132232,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633668,1723035647,Bitcoin Bull Run Still Intact? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says,"After Monday’s market crash, concerns about the stability of Bitcoin’s bull run have emerged. Yet, Ki Young Ju, founder and CEO of CryptoQuant, a leading blockchain analytics firm, maintains a positive outlook. He suggests that, despite the recent crash, on-chain data continues to support the notion that the bull market for Bitcoin remains intact. Bitcoin On-Chain Analysis: Bullish Arguments #1 Bitcoin Hashrate The Bitcoin hashrate, which gauges the computational power utilized in mining and processing transactions, is nearing an all-time high (ATH). Ju notes, “Miner capitulation is nearly over, with hashrate nearing ATH. US mining costs are ~$43K per BTC, so hashrate likely stable unless prices dip below this.” #2 Whale Behavior Significant Bitcoin inflows into custody wallets are another argument to be bullish, indicating strong accumulation by large-scale investors, often referred to as ‘whales’. Ju highlights, “Significant BTC inflows into custody wallets. Permanent Holder addresses increased by 404K BTC, including 40K BTC in US spot ETFs over the last 30 days. New whales are accumulating.” Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Really Safe? New Insights from ‘Black Swan’ Author on Recent Crash #3 Retail Investor Participation The current subdued participation of retail investors is similar to patterns observed in mid-2020. Ju remarks, “Retail investors are mostly absent, similar to mid-2020.” This absence might contribute to less volatility, as retail trading often leads to rapid price swings. #4 Old Whales Still HODL Between March and June, long-term holders (those who have held for over three years) transferred their Bitcoin holdings to newer investors. Currently, there is no significant selling pressure from these veteran holders. Bearish On-Chain Data #1 Macro Risks On the downside, Ju points out macroeconomic risks and recent market activities that could impact Bitcoin’s price stability: “Macro risks could lead to forced sell-offs. There were large crypto deposits by Jump Trading recently, and Binance hit YTD high in daily deposits.” Related Reading: Bitwise CIO Believes The Crypto Crash Sets The Stage For Bitcoin To Thrive – Key Reasons Why #2 Borderline On-Chain Indicators While some on-chain indicators have recently turned bearish, these are borderline, according to Ju. He asserts, “Some on-chain indicators turned bearish but are borderline. If bearish trends persist for over two weeks, market recovery could be challenging.” #3 Bull-Bear Cycle Indicator Flags Bear Phase Notably, the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator has also flagged a bear phase for the first time since January 2023 (high blue area in the chart), warranting close observation. CryptoQuant Head of Research Julio Moreno added that this indicator has previously identified limited bear phases during significant market events like the COVID sell-off in March 2020 and the Chinese mining ban in May 2021. Moreover, it also correctly anticipated the start of the bear market in November 2021. Despite these bearish undercurrents, Ju remains cautiously optimistic about the potential of Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high until the end of the year. “As long as the Bitcoin price stays above $45K, it could break its all-time high again within a year, imo. Some indicators are showing bearish signals. However, they could still recover with a rebound, so we need to watch if it stays at this level for a week or two. If it lingers longer, the risk of a bear market grows, and recovery may be difficult if it lasts over a month,” Ju concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $56,639.

The Grayscale Bittensor Trust and Grayscale Sui Trust are single-asset funds only holding their namesake cryptocurrencies, and are accessible to eligible individual and institutional accredited investors, the firm said in a press release.  ""We are excited to add Bittensor and Sui to our product suite, and believe Bittensor is at the center of the growth of decentralized AI, while Sui is redefining the smart contract blockchain,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, head of product and research at Grayscale.  The new offerings follow Grayscale's launch of a decentralized AI-focused digital asset trust last month, which also offers exposure to TAO together with several other tokens, including near {{NEAR}}, render {{RNDR}} and filecoin {{FIL}}. That fund gathered nearly $1 million of assets under management as of Aug. 5, according to the fund's website.

Despite increasing hash rate, the company's cost per Bitcoin mined has doubled, making it more expensive than buying Bitcoin directly. Bitcoin's future looks promising with potential price increases, but investing in Bitcoin itself or a Bitcoin ETF may be more profitable than owning Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital. I have written about Marathon Digital ( MARA ) where I suspected the company would underperform due to the halving event. Now that the event is over, and we have the company's Q2 2024 results, we can see how it has all played out. This article serves as an update to my original article, with the core thesis that owning Bitcoin itself is better than this miner. Marathon Digital’s Revenues Missed the Mark in Q2 2024 Marathon Digital’s most recent Q2 2024 played out as I hypothesized. After all, if production was cut in half, due to the halving event, and the Bitcoin price did not double, then mathematically there was nowhere for revenue to go but down. The company’s Q2 2024 reported $145.1 million, much lower than the $165.2 million reported last quarter. Analysts expected revenue in Q2 2024 to be $157.1 million, so it can be seen how much Marathon missed the mark on expectations. However, revenue this quarter was still 78% YoY higher than the $81.8 million reported in Q2 2023. This was primarily driven by the increase in the average price of Bitcoin, which remains much higher compared to where it was a year ago. This quarter, the company has made substantial progress on its infrastructure projects and investments. The company grew its operations by more than 10% to a total of roughly 250,000 mining rigs. For the quarter, the company’s installed hash rate is 31.5 EH/s in Q2 2024 with an efficiency of 23.5 joules per terahash. Marathon Digital aims to continue to improve its mining operations via the deployment of additional S21 Pros and immersion cooling systems. The company has also made strides to get its newly acquired sites in Texas and Nebraska up and running with various infrastructure enhancements like airflow enhancements and electrical upgrades. Hash rates on these sites have improved by 15% - 25% ever since Marathon Digital took over operations. Marathon Digital’s management has reiterated its 2024 guidance of a hash rate of 50 EH/s. Marathon Digital (Investor Relations) Bitcoin miners like to show off their increasing hash rate to investors as a sign of progress for the company. The hash rate, for those unfamiliar, is a number that quantifies a network’s power and efficiency. It is a function of the number of computations the miner’s rig can achieve in a second. However, this number is a bit misleading as it isn’t directly tied to revenue, rather what is important is the actual number of Bitcoin mined. As an example, Marathon Digital’s hash rate has significantly increased over the last year, however due to the poor economics of Bitcoin mining the actual number of Bitcoin obtained has declined. In Q2 2024, Marathon Digital produced 2058 Bitcoins with an energized hash rate of 31.5 and an average operational hash rate of 24 EH/s. This was a 30% decrease or 868 fewer Bitcoins compared to the 2926 Bitcoins mined in Q2 2023. This decline came about despite the much lower energized hash rate of 17.7 and an average operational hash rate of 12.1 EH/s. In other words, Marathon Digital’s energized hash rate and average operational hash rate increased by 78% and 98% respectively, however its total Bitcoin mined decreased by 30%. Press Release (Marathon Digital) Profitability Remains Out of Reach The fact that the number of Bitcoins mined has decreased in the midst of an increasing hash rate is worrying. This is because the hash rate does not increase organically but rather due to substantial investments. According to management in the company’s earnings call; The company produced 868 less Bitcoin in the second quarter as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the halving, increased global hash rate and the continued impact of unexpected equipment failures at third-party operated sites and transmission line maintenance, partially offset by an improvement in average operational hash rate. Digging into the company’s income statement, we can see that the Cost of production has substantially increased from a year ago. In Q2 2023 Marathon Digital’s total cost of revenues was $92.5 million, while in Q2 2024 the total cost of revenues roughly doubled to $181.7 million. This means that the implied cost per Bitcoin grew from $31,612 in Q2 2023 ($92.5 million divided by 2926) to $88,287 ($181.7 million divided by 2058) in Q2 2024. Press Release (Marathon Digital) Simply put, it is more expensive for Marathon Digital to mine Bitcoin in Q2 2024 at $88,287 than to simply purchase Bitcoin in the market. The most expensive Bitcoin has ever been during this latest run is approximately $71,500. These numbers could even be worse next quarter, as the halving event took place on April 19, 2024. Meaning there was close to half a month of pre-halving production in these costs. Bitcoin’s Future Remains Bright Now just to re-iterate something that may have been missed from my last two bearish takes on MARA stock, I think Bitcoin is a fine investment. There is certainly a case to be made for Bitcoin reaching $100,000 to $200,000 BTC in the near future. Even now, there is a growing acceptance from both the general public as well as the political elite of Bitcoin’s use cases. For example, a poll done by Seeking Alpha has found that more investors are considering buying crypto to balance their portfolios and diversify risks. Seeking Alpha polled over 1,000 subscribers to get their views on cryptocurrencies and the most significant change found is a 10-point shift from 15% to 24% for new holders of crypto and a decrease of 45% to 37% for negative perceptions of crypto. The new spot ETFs were the most popular form of “crypto investment” something that I mentioned in my previous Marathon Digital article weeks ago. There is also growing acceptance of crypto from the political elite in the US. Both presidential candidates, Trump and Harris, have signaled that their future administration will be friendlier to cryptocurrencies. Trump made headlines in his speech at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference, promising to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. In classic Trump fashion, he concluded his speech with “Have a good time with your Bitcoin and your crypto, and everything else that you’re playing with.” On the Democratic side, the Harris campaign has signaled that it wants to “reset” with crypto companies, signaling a shift away from the Biden Administration’s aggressive SEC enforcement. In other words, politically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could be in a safer regulatory environment in the near future. Conclusion and Valuation Putting this all together, I believe that investors should opt to own Bitcoin or a Bitcoin ETF over Bitcoin miners like Marathon Digital. In the latest quarter, it cost Marathon Digital $88,287 to mine a Bitcoin, while Bitcoin right now is selling at $55,115. Therefore, even if the price of Bitcoin rockets another 60% (from $55,115 to $88,287), Marathon Digital is only breaking even at the gross profit level. Furthermore, this isn’t an issue that is going away. After two more halving events, roughly 8 years from now, Bitcoin’s price might have to be $353,148 just for Marathon Digital to break even. It’s clear based on the 2023 and 2024 data above that the increase in capacity and hash rate is not enough to offset the loss of production from these halving events and the fact that Bitcoin becomes harder to mine as time goes on. The caveat to all this though, is that if you are like Cathie Wood CEO of Ark Invest, or Michael Saylor, the co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) and you believe that Bitcoin will be above $1 million per coin by 2030 or $13 million by 2045.

Bank of Japan deputy governor Shinichi Uchida said that the central bank would not hike borrowing costs, which may have provided some relief for investors of risk assets such as crypto. ""As we're seeing sharp volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets, it's necessary to maintain current levels of monetary easing for the time being,"" Uchida said in a speech to business leaders in Hakodate, Hokkaido. The broader crypto market, measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has risen over 5%, with SOL continuing to lead the gains. The altcoin has regained the $150 mark, on the back of climbing nearly 10%.  Memecoins from the Solana ecosystem surged more than 30% in the past 24 hours, leading gains in the crypto market, as the network’s underlying token SOL, recovered from losses earlier in the week. Cat-themed popcat (POPCAT) and dog token dogwifhat (WIF) surged as much as 25%, before slightly retreating, while smaller tokens MUMU and catdog (CATDOG) rose 30%, data show. Major memecoins on other blockchains, such as DOGE and PEPE, lost as much as 5%. Solana network volumes more than doubled to over $3.3 billion from Monday’s $1.5 billion, banking in fees of at least $750,000 per day, DefiLlama data shows.  Crypto asset manager CoinShares recorded profits after tax of around $513.1 million in Q2, a considerable bump from $12.7 million in the equivalent quarter a year ago. The firm also noted a loss of $481.4 million on the fair value of digital assets, as the crypto market pulled back from its all-time high levels of Q1. Once accounted for this depreciation, CoinShares' comprehensive income for the quarter was $32.6 million, almost five-times the figure for Q2 2023 of $6.3 million. The firm saw its asset management fees more than double to $28.45 million, helped by its acquisition of the ETF unit of Valkyrie, which gave CoinShares a U.S. arm to its ETP business.  Chart of the Day  The Crypto Fear & Greed Index fell to 17 on Tuesday, the lowest in two years.  Readings below 20 represent extreme fear often observed at market bottoms.

32129869,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633649,1723032057,Explosive XRP Prediction: Analyst Foresees 20-Fold Gain,"Market experts and technical indicators imply that XRP might break out in a positive way. After a short rise and retracement, the cryptocurrency has been trading at levels that indicate a break in consolidation. Related Reading: Bloody Monday: Cardano Not Spared From Bloodbath, Suffers 30% Loss At the time of writing, XRP was trading at $0.5149, up 1.1% in the last 24 hours, but sustained a 19.7% drop in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows. Javon Marks, a crypto analyst, has identified numerous significant technical indicators that support the optimistic outlook for the coin, despite it shedding a lot of value in the weekly frame. A symmetrical triangle structure is frequently observed in his chart analysis, which is frequently linked to substantial price increases. $XRP recently broke out temporarily which looks to have been only an attempted breakout but, between Price Action and the RSI, there are patterns still present through bull divergences that can suggest a successful bullish breakout to be on the horizon! On a conservative note,… https://t.co/BCrp9CwT6i pic.twitter.com/XGGiv0nBDp — JAVON⚡️MARKS (@JavonTM1) August 6, 2024 The MACD and RSI indicators both have levels that indicate a bullish divergence. The resiliency and upward trajectory of XRP are on display in these numbers. Expect Short-Term Gains Over the next seven days, XRP is expected to show an uptick, indicating a positive short term perspective. Based on information from the crypto prediction tool CoinCheckup, XRP is trading 20.98% below the expected price for the next month right now. Technical signs, however, show a bullish change just ahead. Rising purchasing pressure and the present price levels point to the coin maybe being set to surpass its recent resistance levels. The RSI and MACD both provide indications of positive momentum, therefore supporting the possibility for upward movement. Analysts think this might result in a successful breakout effort, driving XRP to fresh highs in the not too distant future. Projected Medium-Term Growth Looking further into the near future, XRP has similarly bright medium-term potential. Reflecting great market confidence and investor interest, CoinCheckup’s study projects a 22.68% price rise over the next three months. This predicted expansion fits rising acceptance of cryptocurrencies and more general market patterns. Based on a thorough investigation, Marks’ symmetrical triangle formation shows that XRP maybe preparing for a notable price movement. This pattern, along with positive divergent RSI readings, suggests that XRP has the ability to break out from its present period of consolidation and go very significantly higher. XRP: High Price Targets With a one-year growth estimate of 103.77%, long-term XRP estimates remain quite positive. This continuous rise points to XRP as a useful altcoin for those looking for both quick profits and long-term development. Growth projections climb sharply to 180.60% over a six-month period, therefore indicating the prospect for significant increases. More ambitious projections, including those from Marks, indicate that XRP may see its price rise to between $15 and $18, therefore reflecting a huge gain of over 2,101%. Such forecasts rely on technical analysis patterns and past market behavior that have lately shown large price swings. Related Reading: Aave Protocol Unfazed By Market Jitters, Surges 21% Further driving these increases are the growing acceptance and integration of the wider cryptocurrency industry into conventional financial institutions. The liquidity and trading volume for XRP are projected to increase as institutional investors and large-scale traders become more engaged, thereby maybe driving even more notable price swings. These metrics emphasizes XRP’s transformative power in the changing digital asset scene as well as its appeal as a high-reward investment possibility.

DAWN is currently operating in a testnet environment ahead of launching on Solana, Andrena announced via email on Wednesday.  Wireless internet provider Andrena has raised $18 million in funding to develop a protocol for decentralized broadband.

DAWN incorporates blockchain technology to build a trustless system of exchange between network participants to allow for a ""proof of backhaul"" - a measure of throughput capacity at each node.

An earlier version of the story said the funds appeared to have come from the protocol's treasury.  Synthetix's former treasurer, SynthaMan, said they ""had nothing left"" after being liquidated as crypto markets plunged over the weekend.  The DAO's founder unlocked $6.5 million from an Illuvium vesting contract and sent $86,000 to the former employee, on-chain data appear to show.  On-chain data appear to show that Synthetix founder Kain unlocked $6.5 million from an Illuvium vesting contract and transferred $86,000 to SynthaMan, a former treasury council member, who was liquidated during the weekend's crypto market plunge, blockchain sleuth EmberCN posted on X.  EmberCN also said SynthaMan, who describes himself as the ""ex-Synthetix treasurer"" on X, also received approximately $112,000 in donations in the past two days after posting that all his SNX was lost ""due to liquidation"" and had ""nothing left.""  ""Some folks asked for donation wallet,"" SynthaMan wrote on X. ""If you guys willing to donate or lend me some money until my ILV unlocks in September, you can send it to: Spartan.eth Otherwise I wont even ask you for that. Just need to survive 1.5 months."" ILV refers to the cryptocurrency illuvium.  Etherscan shows that a wallet tagged as belonging to project-founder Kain sent the tokens to the Spartan.eth address.  ""@kaiynne unstaked his ILV and sent some to me,"" SynthaMan wrote on X after the earlier version of this story was published. ""At no point he used 'Projects's Treasury'.""

Interestingly, despite this so-called ‘Red Monday,’ Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg Senior exchange-traded fund (ETF) analyst, revealed in a post uploaded earlier today that investors of BlackRock’s crypto fund, IBIT, maintained their holdings without flinching. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds Past $56,000, Ethereum Over $2,500: Key Factors Unshaken By Market Meltdown According to Balchunas, during this chaotic period whereby panic selling may be seen as the norm, BlackRock investors particularly showcased a strong level of resilience by not liquidating any portion of their cryptocurrency holdings. What makes this more interesting is that these same investors had already endured about an 8% loss the previous week and were facing additional losses during the Bitcoin market crash. Balchunas noted: Compared to some of these degens these boomers [Blackrock investors] are like the Rock of Gibraltar. You guys are so lucky to have them. Balchunas further reported that although BlackRock registered a minor 0.3% total outflow from its assets under management (AUM) during this period, it is relatively small compared to the overall market movements. Interestingly, a third of these outflows were attributed to Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which faced challenges during the same period. Furthermore, Balchunas speculated that although the immediate reaction to the market downturn was more subdued than expected, the week might still see more significant capital withdrawals, potentially reaching the billions. Balchunas noted: I could see some more outflows this week. I was thinking a couple billion would leave, maybe 5%, which means 95% hung tough which would be strong. So far tho looking much stronger than that. Even I’ve been surprised by the HODL ability of the boomers and equally surprised by the weakness of the natives. My lord you finally have ETFs here bringing in $17b and you can’t just chill? Bitcoin Current Recovery And Outlook Following the recent dip in Bitcoin comes a notable recovery, which started earlier today. So far, Bitcoin has increased to as high as $56,957 in the early hours of today before retracing slightly to trade at $56,672, at the time of writing, up by 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

The Bitcoin dominance should peak during the next 1-2 months. Looser monetary policy should cause Altcoins to outperform in the post-halving year after capitulating during the halving year. Hodlers have stopped taking profits. It’s time to stack Sats & Wei again. Recap of the Year for Crypto 2024 has been a great year for investors so far with the S&P500 ( SPX ) returning ~10% YTD with the largest companies outperforming. Not surprisingly, it has been a good year for crypto assets. Similar to the outperformance of large caps, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) offered by far the best risk/reward in the crypto asset space, returning ~28% YTD. The second-largest crypto asset, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), returned only ~5% YTD. Data by YCharts Personally, the situation is favorable for me. On February 26th, I i ntroduced the possibility of a mid-cycle correction for crypto assets at around $50,000 per bitcoin along with rising bitcoin dominance, while signaling that I would not take profits for now. On April 23rd, I changed my mind after prices rose above $71,000 and took profits by selling ~20% of my position. The rationale was that my position had become too large and long-term holders were starting to sell bitcoin into the rally. Since then, I've been steadily but cautiously DCA'ing exclusively into bitcoin as I suggested in my last article. I believe the next 4-6 months will be a great time to rebuild and/or restructure one's crypto asset allocation as I believe this mid-cycle correction will take longer than most market participants expect. It is important to know the previous crypto cycles and macroeconomic circumstances to be prepared for similar events and drawdowns. Therefore, I'm going to share and discuss my game plan for the rest of this year and early 2025 - the post-halving year. Here's my bitcoin positioning over the last 3-4 years: Positioning of Author (tradingview.com) Sentiment Turned with Rising Prices It should come as no surprise that sentiment turned positive after bitcoin started to rise from the lows of 2022 and 2023. However, over the last four months, the number of unique addresses that were active as either senders or receivers started to drop 20% from 860,000 addresses to the current 685,000 addresses as prices started to top out at a bitcoin price of ~$70,000. BTCUSD (orange) & active addresses (blue) (tradingview.com) The further drop in on-chain activity solidifies the assumptions I have been making throughout this half-year about a mid-cycle correction before the real bull run. Currently, active addresses have even fallen below the trendline that has been forming since 2018. However, the move could be exaggerated by the immense ETF inflows, which could have depressed the number of active custodial addresses as more market participants opt for non-custodial addresses. Ignoring the distortions of bitcoin ETFs, I think it is fair to say that the rally from $15,000 to $70,000 happened without mania and broad retail speculation on the price of bitcoin, unlike 2021. During the last two significant bull runs in 2017 and 2020, active addresses shot through the roof along with crypto asset prices. Interestingly, both 2017 and 2020 were post-halving years. Previous halves occurred in 2016 and 2019. Historically, the mania phases of the bull run haven't occurred in halving years, where everyone expects them, but in post-halving years. This fits well with the odds of a prolonged consolidation phase throughout 2024 (halving year) and a real bull run in 2025 (post-halving year). The Link to Monetary Policy Personally, I find it amazing that the four-year cycle in 2023 and 2024 played out almost the same as it always has. I believe that the biggest influence on crypto asset prices still comes from monetary policy, i.e., demand rather than supply, as bitcoin is designed to hedge monetary debasement. The thought process is as follows: During periods of monetary restraint with less quantitative easing, even quantitative tightening and/or restrictive interest rates, crypto assets should underperform. Bitcoin's dominance (percentage market share of Bitcoin vs. Altcoins) should increase, similar to the outperformance of less risky large cap stocks and riskier small-cap stocks during such periods in the stock market. After monetary conditions have been restrictive for a long enough period of time, assets begin to undergo some form of correction. During this correction, monetary conditions ease significantly and bitcoin dominance peaks, i.e., altcoins (small caps) begin to outperform bitcoin (large caps). These phases of the cycle are where broad-based retail speculation finds its best breeding ground. I believe we could be in this phase again as early as 2025. Interest rates have been restrictive for long enough, and the economy is starting to show weakness. BTCUSD (orange) & FEDFUNDS (blue) (tradingview.com) As interest rates get cut, asset prices usually fall. Many investors will try to rationalize that lower interest rates should be positive for asset prices because of lower discount rates. However, falling interest rates are the primary signal of a weakening economy, hence the correction in asset prices that is historically associated with rapidly falling interest rates. It is only after the asset price correction that looser monetary conditions begin to drive markets to new highs and crypto assets begin to outperform again. The chart above doesn't do justice to how much Bitcoin prices fell during the halving year of 2019 into the early part of the 2020 post-halving year. In June 2019, Bitcoin peaked at $13,880 only to fall to the low of the halving year in December 2019 at $6,425 - a drop of ~53%. In early March of the post-halving year, during Covid, Bitcoin temporarily dropped as much as ~72% to a low of $3,850. Applying historical drawdowns to today's situation, a bitcoin price of $36,000 - 50% off the peak in March 2024 - doesn't seem unrealistic and should be expected by every investor. Bitcoin Dominance has Little Upside Left Bitcoin's dominance fits perfectly into the cycle described above. In times of monetary restriction, investors tend to flock to larger, less risky assets. In the crypto asset space, this is bitcoin because it has by far the most decentralized, time-tested and secure network of any crypto asset. However, when monetary policy begins to ease significantly, speculation drives investors into smaller, riskier, less decentralized and insecure altcoins. BTCUSD (orange) & BTC.D (blue) (tradingview.com) During the last mid-cycle correction in 2019, bitcoin's dominance topped out, and during the mania phase in the post-halving year of 2021, bitcoin significantly underperformed the average altcoin. I believe it is likely that we are in a similar situation. Since early 2023, when monetary policy started to become restrictive again, bitcoin has significantly outperformed the average altcoin. The Bitcoin dominance increased from 40% to 56%. Due to more and more upcoming Altcoin projects, the clear overall trend of Bitcoin dominance remains downward, with lower highs. However, the dominance bottomed in 2018 and 2022 at ~40%. The dangers of holding an altcoin during a period of rising bitcoin dominance, however, is not only that the risk/reward of simply holding bitcoin is much greater as both variables work in favor of bitcoin. But many altcoins disappear forever in the depths of the bear market. In addition, historically, bitcoin's dominance has risen in three of the four years of recent cycles, only to collapse in the mania year of the cycle. Therefore, I believe it makes the most sense to maintain a strong core position in bitcoin at all times in one's crypto asset portfolio, and only diversify a portion of it into altcoins when bitcoin dominance is near its peak. After all, investors could choose the wrong altcoin and still underperform bitcoin even during falling bitcoin dominance. Hodlers have Stopped Taking Profits One of the main arguments of my last article was that hodlers (wallets with a bitcoin holding period of more than one year, i.e. the ""smart money"" of the crypto asset space) have started to take profits. Historically, hodlers tend to sell into rallies and accumulate during bear markets. The same is happening in this mid-cycle correction. Hodlers have stopped taking profits as prices have continued to fall to now ~$56,000. If the mid-cycle correction continues, most hodlers would start accumulating, according to the historical behavior of the cohort, especially visible during the mid-cycle correction of 2019. This dynamic would be the precursor to a possible mania phase in the post-halving year of 2025, as Hodlers begin to sell aggressively again to short-term holders when monetary conditions are easier and altcoins again outperform bitcoin. BTCUSD (orange) & Hodler Positioning (blue) (tradingview.com) The Yield Curve Suggests a Hard Landing The US10Y-US02Y Yield Curve is finally starting to steepen after inverting in June 2022 as short-term yields are now falling, putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to react and lower the Fed Funds Rate. The yield curve has a great track record of predicting recessions after a curve steepens out of an inversion. The last three times the yield curve steepened out of an inversion were before the Covid crash in 2020, before the Great Financial Crisis in 2008, and before the dot-com bubble in 2000. This time, the yield curve has been inverted for more than two years. An inverted yield curve means that the average bond investor expects falling long-term interest rates due to impending economic stress, and therefore lower inflation and growth. US10Y - US02Y (blue) (tradingview.com) The curve hasn't steepened out of an inversion yet, but signs of economic stress and rising unemployment increase the odds every day. The last time that the yield curve steepened out of an inversion was in late 2019, before the Bitcoin midcycle correction and the top of the last cycle of the Bitcoin dominance. BTCUSD (orange) / US10Y-US02Y (blue) (tradingview.com) If the yield curve continues its current steepening and comes out of the inversion in the next few weeks, the chances of a mid-cycle correction in crypto asset prices due to the very likely scenario of a recession increase significantly. The continued steepening would likely result from falling short-term interest rates due to signs of immediate economic uncertainty. In 2019, the ""hard landing"" of the covid crash led to a sharp rise in unemployment. Perhaps we can see some early signs of such a dynamic in this cycle as well. However, the unemployment rate historically rises sharply in a short period of time without much predictive power. BTCUSD (orange) & Unemployment Level (blue) (tradingview.com) Conclusions for Positioning I have a passive and an active part of my crypto asset portfolio. The passive portfolio is the larger part and has a 100% Bitcoin allocation. I don't plan to do anything here. After all, even during the 2022 bear market, the bitcoin hash rate has been rising steadily since its inception, making the network more secure day by day without any interference from price volatility. Fundamentally, Bitcoin serves as a hedge against monetary debasement. I believe that increasing demand for a permissionless, decentralized, immutable, deflationary digital asset in a world of centralized monetary debasement seems inevitable. BTCUSD (orange) & BTC Hashrate (blue) (tradingview.com) In addition, the number of retail users is growing steadily, even though the number has dropped in the past during the biggest corrections / crashes of crypto asset prices. Therefore, it makes sense to have a position in this emerging asset class that hasn't stopped growing rapidly since its inception. BTCUSD (orange) & Number of Retail Users (blue) (tradingview.com) For my active crypto asset portfolio, there are a lot of consequences because the recent dynamics are playing out similarly to 2019. Due to my expectation of rising Bitcoin dominance the active portfolio consisted of ~ 95% Bitcoin. However, over the next few months, I believe that rotating into the second-largest crypto asset, Ethereum, makes a lot of sense from a risk/reward perspective - especially when interest rates have already fallen and asset prices have corrected lower. As I expect the Bitcoin dominance to peak in the next 1-2 months, it also makes sense from a risk/reward perspective to diversify into a broad range of altcoins, led by Ethereum of course, as it has proven to sustainably survive multiple crypto cycles. Altcoins have massively underperformed over the past two years, but potentially looser monetary policy in a post-halving year is the perfect breeding ground for speculation and short-term retail interest. Typically, retail investors tend to buy riskier and smaller assets, so the average altcoin should outperform if a bull run materializes in 2025. Until then, I believe it is time to stack Sats & Wei again.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4711388-bitcoin-time-to-stack-sats-again-rating-upgrade?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32126656.jpeg

42407754,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga41NX,1723025038,Coinbase’s Paul Grewal Says Crypto Should Remain Non-Partisan,"Grewal is inspired by Asia’s quick embrace of crypto regulations, but remains optimistic about the U.S.  If crypto policy is going to succeed in the U.S. it needs to be a bi-partisan issue, bringing together both sides of the aisle, he argued.  At the Bitcoin Nashville Conference, the loudest and most thunderous applause came from Republican candidate Donald Trump’s promise to fire Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler. Republicans have taken on crypto on as a pet issue, but Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, doesn’t want this to become a partisan issue.  “My number one concern is that crypto becomes politicized and becomes a partisan issue in ways that, at the very least, slow and perhaps even worse, threaten its continued growth and development,"" Grewal said during an interview at the Asia Blockchain Summit in Taipei, emphasizing the need for bipartisan support for policy modernization.  Part of the need for change in the U.S. comes from a reliance on antiquated frameworks, like the Howey Test, to address the reality of twenty-first-century finance.  “There needs to be an understanding that the Howey Test was developed in the context of an Orange Grove real estate in Florida in the 1940s and 50s,"" he said, arguing that applying the Howey Test “blindly and mechanically” to blockchains and crypto does not make practical sense.  “Precedents, even from the Supreme Court, have always been recognized as applying in particular contexts and needing to adapt to new technologies and issues that emerge in markets and in the economy more generally,” he said. “It's important to respect precedents and to use the wisdom garnered from decades of applying them in all sorts of other contexts without being beholden to them in a way that just doesn't make practical sense.”  Asia doesn’t have the same binding constraints as the Howey test, and Grewal appreciates how regulators are writing the rules from the ground up while listening to feedback from the industry.  After all, Hong Kong’s path to creating its digital asset license framework – and allowing crypto ETF issuers to offer in-kind redemptions, which the SEC prohibits – began with an announcement in the fall of 2022 that authorities in the city were reconsidering their stance on the topic.  ""What is most inspiring to me here in Asia is that there's a focus on discrete issues and almost no focus on ideology,"" he said. ""There is an interest in understanding the technology, where the industry is headed, and our experiences…because they want to learn and take the best, while avoiding the worst.""  In contrast, within the U.S. it has been a challenge to have “meaningful dialogue with large chunks of the government when it comes to crypto and policy,"" Grewal opined. However, he remains optimistic about America, as both major political parties are beginning to recognize the significance of crypto.  ""Crypto, at the end of the day, it's code. There are plenty of other issues in the United States and all over the world for us to disagree on. We should be able to agree on what code does and how it operates,"" he concludes.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/07/coinbases-paul-grewal-says-crypto-should-remain-non-partisan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f0d3eedcf6166a033bc3dc2f60da9dcaf19b5e0-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32124963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633627,1723024832,"BlackRock Plans Ethereum ETF Options, Files With SEC","In a notable development, BlackRock, one of the world’s largest asset managers and ETF issuers, has collaborated with the Nasdaq Stock Market in a move to introduce options for its Ethereum ETF recently approved by US regulators. 2025 Decision On Ethereum ETF Options Proposal The filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlines BlackRock’s proposal to amend Options 4, Section 3 to allow for options trading on the iShares Ethereum ETF Trust. Related Reading: 3 Reasons To Buy XRP Now: Crypto Analyst Shares Bullish Forecast Per the filling, if approved, options on the Trust will adhere to the Exchange’s existing rules for ETF options trading. These rules govern various aspects such as listing criteria, expirations, exercise prices, margin requirements, and trading halt procedures, ensuring a standardized approach to trading options on the Trust. The filling further reads: ….The Exchange believes that offering options on the Trust for trading on the Exchange will promote competition by providing investors with an additional, relatively low-cost means to hedge their portfolios and meet their investment needs in connection with spot ether prices and ether related products and positions However, Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart noted that the introduction of options on BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF is subject to regulatory approval not only from the SEC, but also from the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Seyffart expects a final decision from the SEC around April 9, 2025. Key Levels To Watch For ETH’s Price This development, if approved by the SEC, would give investors further exposure to the second largest cryptocurrency on the market. However, in the near term, ETH needs bullish catalysts to break out of the downtrend witnessed especially on Monday, when the token retraced over 20% following global economic uncertainties and increased selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sellers Running Out Of Coins As Dominance Hits 3-Year High At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $2,488, up 1.8% over the past 24 hours, after plunging to a low of $2,112, a level not seen since January 2023 on Monday. This level is key as crypto analyst Trading Tank, in a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), claims that as long as ETH remains above $2,400, further price recovery could be seen in the near future for the second largest cryptocurrency on the market. Trading Tank also highlighted the $2,575 level as crucial for another leg higher to test its first resistance to climb to higher levels at $2,690 on the ETH/USDT daily chart. In the scenario in which ETH could breach this barrier, the next hurdle to watch is noted by the $2,910 resistance level, which is imperative to reclaim the $3,000 milestone.

32125605,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=23971,1723024588,Thị Trường Phản Ứng Thế Nào Khi Ethereum ETF Ra Mắt?,"Việc ra mắt các quỹ ETF Ethereum là một bước đột phá lớn, giúp các nhà đầu tư dễ dàng tiếp cận Ether thông qua các công cụ đầu tư quen thuộc. Các tổ chức tài chính nổi tiếng như BlackRock và Fidelity đã đổ xô vào, làm tăng tính hợp pháp và hấp dẫn của Ethereum. Tuy nhiên, khối lượng giao dịch ban đầu thấp hơn so với Bitcoin ETF, cho thấy kỳ vọng khác nhau. Ethereum ETF Ra Mắt Nhưng Chưa Bằng Bitcoin ETF Ngày 23 tháng 7 năm 2024, các quỹ ETF Ethereum chính thức lên sàn, giúp các nhà đầu tư tiếp cận Ether dễ dàng hơn. Các quỹ này đầu tư trực tiếp vào Ether, không giống như các sản phẩm trước đây chỉ theo dõi hợp đồng tương lai. Các tên tuổi lớn như BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale đều tham gia, cạnh tranh với các tính năng và mức phí khác nhau để thu hút nhà đầu tư. Việc này làm cho Ether trở nên hợp pháp hơn trong mắt các nhà đầu tư truyền thống. Phản Ứng Ban Đầu Của Ethereum ETF Phản ứng ban đầu với các ETF Ethereum khá tốt nhưng chưa đạt mức bùng nổ như Bitcoin ETF. Ngày đầu giao dịch, dòng vốn vào đạt 2,2 tỷ đô la, so với 4,6 tỷ đô la của Bitcoin ETF. Một số quỹ như Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust và BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust có sự quan tâm lớn nhưng chưa phải là cú hích mạnh. Các ETF Ethereum thiếu tính năng staking, khiến một số nhà đầu tư có thể chọn mua ether trực tiếp để nhận phần thưởng staking. Ethereum ETF Có Thể Gây Ảnh Hưởng Lớn Hơn Bitcoin ETF? Ethereum không chỉ là tài sản kỹ thuật số lớn thứ hai mà còn có cộng đồng phát triển mạnh mẽ. Các công cụ và ngôn ngữ hợp đồng thông minh của Ethereum đã tạo nên một hệ sinh thái Web3 phát triển mạnh mẽ. ETF Ethereum có thể là cầu nối giúp các tổ chức lớn tham gia sâu hơn vào thị trường tài sản kỹ thuật số. Hơn nữa, Ethereum còn là trung tâm của nhiều dự án blockchain khác, làm tăng tính tương tác và đổi mới trong ngành. Tóm lại là: Việc ra mắt Ethereum ETF là một cột mốc lớn, giúp Ether trở nên dễ tiếp cận và hợp pháp hơn trong mắt các nhà đầu tư truyền thống. Dù khối lượng giao dịch ban đầu chưa bùng nổ như Bitcoin ETF, nhưng tiềm năng của Ethereum trong hệ sinh thái tài chính kỹ thuật số là rất lớn. ETF Ethereum có thể mở ra nhiều cơ hội đầu tư và phát triển, không chỉ cho Ether mà còn cho cả hệ sinh thái blockchain.

SOL registered some of the largest gains after reclaiming the $140 support zone on Tuesday morning. Its strength was highlighted by several market watchers, who shared their bullish predictions for the token. However, an analyst warned investors of a key level to watch out. Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Stays Afloat With 31% Gains Amid Crypto Market Mayhem Solana Leads The Market Recovery As the crypto market recovers, Solana saw a massive 30% bounce from its lowest trading price of $110, registered on Monday. This performance crowned SOL the biggest gainer among the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, surpassing Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH)’s recovery. Pseudonym trader Glitch Capital compared BTC, ETH, and SOL’s charts, deeming Solana’s the “best looking one out of the three” by far. To the trader, SOL “swept lows into $120 support and held nicely” compared to the two largest cryptocurrencies. Per the post, the token is testing its M15 trend as resistance, which could give SOL a decent push,” if it can flip this trend into support. Similarly, trader Eugene Ng Ah Sio praised the token’s performance. “One thing of note is the absolute monstrous strength $SOL shows, whether it’s rain or shine,” said the trader in an X post. Based on the chart, the trader believes “it’s pretty much given” that the cryptocurrency will hit a new all-time high (ATH) “at some point” during this cycle as “there are simply more buyers than sellers.” Crypto Jelle, market analyst and investor, reaffirmed his SOL forecast as the token was “still holding the key support area, and the weekly candle is green.” In a previous analysis, Jelle stated that Solana looked “ripe to push higher.” Jelle predicts the token will reach a new ATH during Q4 2024 and set a $600 price target for this cycle. SOL Price Could See Another 10-15% Drop Despite the bullish sentiment, Ali Martinez revealed that SOL’s TD Sequential indicator showed a sell signal on the hourly chart. This signal suggested the token could potentially lose the $140 support zone, which it’s been testing throughout the day. Failing to maintain this support level could trigger a retrace to the $135-$130 price range. According to the analyst, Solana could find some relief at the $146 mark as “breaking the risk line (…) would invalidate this signal.” Moreover, reclaiming this level could “potentially drive SOL up to $150-$166” resistance levels. Altcoin Sherpa believes investors have a good accumulation range within the $125-$150 prices. To him, Solana remains one of the strongest performers of the bull run and will be “one of the best retail chains this cycle.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Rebounds Past $56,000, Ethereum Over $2,500: Key Factors Additionally, Sherpa highlighted SOL’s “strong reactions today” but forecasted another drop to the $125 mark soon. “I still think you get another shot at $125 or lower in a few weeks, personally,” said the analyst. As of this writing, Solana is trading at $148, a 10% surge in the last 24 hours.

Bitstamp will help Stripe manage fiat-to-crypto conversions and transfers to consumers.  CORRECTION (Aug. 7, 09:51 UTC): Corrects Bitstamp's partner to Stripe throughout. An earlier version of this story said the crypto exchange was working with Strike.  Payments processor Stripe has joined forces with crypto exchange Bitstamp to accelerate its expansion in the European Union by making fiat-to-crypto on-ramp easier for users, the companies announced Wednesday.  The fintech firm offers a customizable widget that developers can embed into their product to allow conversion of crypto and instant settlement of transactions. It currently supports multiple cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin {{BTC}}, Ethereum {{ETH}}, Solana {{SOL}}, Stellar {{XLM}}, and USD Coin {{USDC}}. The widget won't be available to U.K. customers, the two companies said in a press release.  Bitstamp will help the fintech firm manage fiat-to-cryptocurrency conversion and transfers to consumers. This, in turn, will expand the crypto exchange’s Bitstamp-as-a-service product, the white-label version of its crypto trading services to banks and fintechs.  On June 6, the popular trading firm Robinhood (HOOD) said it would buy Bitstamp in a $200 million all-cash deal.

The surge in Solana-based tokens contrasted with declines in major memecoins on other blockchains.  Memecoins on the Solana ecosystem surged more than 30% in the past 24 hours, leading gains in the crypto market, as the network’s underlying token SOL, recovered from losses from earlier in the week.  Cat-themed popcat (POPCAT) and dog token dogwifhat (WIF) surged as much as 25%, before slightly retreating, while smaller tokens MUMU and catdog (CATDOG) rose 30%, data show. Major memecoins on other blockchains, such as dogecoin {{DOGE}} and pepe (PEPE), lost as much as 5%, showing a preference for Solana-based tokens.  Solana network volumes more than doubled to over $3.3 billion from Monday’s $1.5 billion, banking in fees of at least $750,000 per day, DefiLlama data shows. Fees generated by Pump, a popular platform used to issue new memecoins on Solana, increased to $535,000 in the past 24 hours compared to under $300,000 on Monday – indicative of higher risk-on activity among traders.  The ecosystem activity came as SOL rose 7.5%, trading over $150 in European morning hours on Wednesday to beat the broad-based CoinDesk 20’s 2.23% rise. It fell from $145 to as low as $112 on Monday amid a broader market rout but has since led gains among major tokens.  Optimism around the ecosystem comes ahead of a widely expected SOL exchange-traded fund (ETF), which could be the third spot token offered to professional U.S.-based investors behind bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}}.  “The possibility of an SOL ETF shows promising signs to investors on SOL’s mainstream adoption,” Lucy Hu, senior analyst at Metalpha, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat. “The quick rebound of SOL indicates renewed confidence in the broader crypto space as the market becomes more stabilized,”  “SOL has shown to be robust with innovations, and meme coins have been rising in popularity,” Hu added.

32120131,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633602,1723017607,"Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Plunge Back To $51,000 On Wedge Pattern Breakdown","Bitcoin may be experiencing a price recovery towards the $57,000 level after a sharp 20% drop on Monday that sent the largest cryptocurrency on the market to a low of $49,000 not seen since February. Still, BTC is not out of the woods yet, as a concerning pattern has emerged on its 10-day chart. Analysts Spot Bearish Signals According to technical analyst Ali Martinez, Bitcoin is forming a rising wedge pattern, a bearish continuation pattern often linked to further downtrends. While BTC may climb as high as $57,000 at the upper boundary of the wedge, Martinez warns that investors should look for a potential breakdown that could pull the cryptocurrency back down to around $51,000. Related Reading: UNI Price Bounces Back 13% Above $5.6, Can Bulls Maintain Control? Martinez also highlighted that one of Bitcoin’s key support levels, based on its market value to realized value (MVRV) pricing bands, is currently at the $54,000 mark. This level is crucial in preventing a more substantial drop towards the $40,000 region. Conversely, if the $54,000 support holds, the analyst sees the key resistance on the upside at $67,000. Another analyst, Rekt Capital, has also observed that Bitcoin is showing signs of attempting to recover and fill the new CME gap above with the currency’s current price recovery of 4.5% recorded in the last hours, which ranges from $59,400 to $62,550. However, the analyst noted that a smaller CME gap has formed at a slightly lower level, between $53,700 and $54,600, which any short-term dip in the market could potentially fill. Reasons For Optimism In Bitcoin Market Amidst these bearish technical indicators, there is a glimmer of optimism, as according to Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO of market analysis firm CryptoQuant, several key metrics suggest that the bull market remains intact despite the recent pullback. According to Ju, one of the key signs is the recovery in Bitcoin’s hashrate, a measure of the computing power dedicated to the network. Ju contends that miner capitulation is nearly over, with the hashrate nearing all-time highs. This is significant, as US mining costs are approximately $43,000 per BTC, indicating that the hashrate will likely remain stable unless prices dip below this level. Additionally, Ju has observed significant inflows of Bitcoin into custody wallets, indicating that large institutional investors, or “whales,” are actively accumulating digital assets. The analyst noted that Permanent Holder addresses, which hold their Bitcoin for over 3 years, have increased by 404,000 BTC, including 40,000 BTC in US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) over the past 30 days. Related Reading: XRP Whales Take Advantage Of 20% Drop To Buy Millions Worth Of Tokens In contrast to the increased whale activity, Ju has observed a relative absence of retail investors, similar to the market conditions in mid-2020. This could be interpreted as a positive sign, as it indicates that the current price movements are not driven by speculative froth but rather by institutional investors’ strategic accumulation of Bitcoin. Lastly, Ju noted a reduction in the selling pressure from long-term Bitcoin holders, or “old whales,” who sold their holdings to new whales between March and June. The analyst believes that the lack of significant selling pressure from these experienced investors is a bullish signal, as it suggests that a new generation of institutional players is now shaping the market with a more long-term outlook. At the time of writing, BTC is struggling to break above its current price level of $56,670 while trimming losses in larger time frames, which amounted to 13% last week.

32081749,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633571,1723014038,Experts Believe The Dogecoin Hype Is Over And Mpeppe (MPEPE) Will Take Over.,"Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been the poster child for memecoins, riding waves of social media hype and celebrity endorsements to impressive heights. However, the fervor that once surrounded Dogecoin (DOGE) appears to be waning. Analysts and experts in the cryptocurrency market are noting a shift in investor sentiment as the coin’s momentum starts to decline. While Dogecoin (DOGE) still holds a significant place in the market, its days of meteoric rises driven by viral trends may be over. Mpeppe (MPEPE): Formidable Player As Dogecoin (DOGE) loses its luster, a new contender is capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts: Mpeppe (MPEPE). Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly emerging as a formidable player in the memecoin space, leveraging a blend of humor, internet culture, and robust blockchain technology. This combination is proving to be highly appealing to a broad audience, positioning Mpeppe (MPEPE) as the next big thing in the crypto world. Mpeppe (MPEPE) differentiates itself from Dogecoin (DOGE) by integrating advanced decentralized finance (DeFi) elements into its ecosystem. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has largely remained a meme-driven token, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is innovating with features like yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance. These DeFi components provide substantial utility and add value to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) community, attracting both casual investors and serious crypto enthusiasts. Financial Opportunities Investors are increasingly looking for cryptocurrencies that offer real financial opportunities beyond just price speculation. While Dogecoin (DOGE) has relied heavily on market hype, Mpeppe (MPEPE) offers tangible financial benefits through its DeFi integrations. Investors can participate in yield farming and liquidity mining, earning rewards and generating income through their Mpeppe (MPEPE) holdings. This financial utility makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) an attractive option for both new and seasoned investors. Expert Predictions Many experts believe that Dogecoin (DOGE) has peaked and that its future growth will be limited. On the other hand, the same experts are predicting significant upside potential for Mpeppe (MPEPE). With its innovative approach and strong community support, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is expected to see substantial gains in the coming months.

32116386,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633426,1723012228,Is Bitcoin In A Bear Market Now? Here’s What On-Chain Data Suggests,"Bitcoin has gone through a major crash recently, but has the asset yet breached the historical bear market boundary? Here’s what on-chain data says. Bitcoin Is Currently Under Realized Price Of New Whales In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed what the Realized Price of different key groups in the Bitcoin market is looking like right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Lowest Since FTX Crash, Signal To Buy The “Realized Price” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the average cost basis or acquisition price that the investors of a given group currently share. When the asset’s spot price is above this metric, it means the cohort as a whole can be considered to be in a state of profit. On the other hand, BTC’s value under the indicator suggests the average group member is holding a net loss. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Realized Price for some major cohorts on the Bitcoin network: The first Bitcoin cohort listed here is the “New Whales,” which include the large investors (more than 1,000 BTC in holdings) who bought their coins within the past 155 days. The likes of the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other custody wallets would be included in this category. This group currently has a Realized Price of $65,000, meaning that these whales would be in notable losses after the latest cryptocurrency crash. The next group, the Binance Traders, has a cost basis of $55,000, around where the asset’s spot price is trading. Thus, these investors would currently be just breaking even on their investments. Bitcoin still holds a distance above the Realized Price of the third group, the Miner Whales, at $45,000. As the CryptoQuant founder has pointed out, BTC dipping below this level has historically confirmed a bear market for the coin. From the chart, it’s visible that the asset last saw major breaches of the level back in November 2018 and May 2022. It also saw a temporary break during the COVID crash in March 2020. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $1 Billion As Bitcoin Crashes To $51,000 As the latest crash has been unable to take Bitcoin below this cost basis of the mining companies, it’s possible that a transition towards a bear market hasn’t happened yet. The last cohort in the chart is the Long-Term Holder Whales, which includes the whales that have been holding for more than 155 days. The Realized Price of this group has never been breached in the coin’s entire history and currently trades around $22,000. BTC Price Bitcoin has recovered over the past day as its price has gone up 7% to reclaim the $55,000 mark.

42407757,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga41XS,1723009343,Bitcoin's Impending 'Death Cross' May Trap Bears as Bank of Japan Eases Rate Concerns,"BOJ's Uchida downplayed rate hike concerns amid market volatility.  The anti-risk yen slides while BTC and stock futures rise after Uchida's comments.  The renewed risk-on hints at a possible bitcoin death cross bear trap.  It appears bitcoin's {{BTC}} impending death cross, a bearish technical pattern, will again live up to its reputation as a contrary indicator, presaging renewed bullish price action as it did in September 2023.  That's because early on Wednesday, the influential deputy governor of the Bank of Japan (BOJ), Shinichi Uchida, said that the central bank wouldn't hike borrowing costs when markets are unstable, weakening the case for a continued unwinding of ""yen carry trades"" and resulting risk aversion in risk assets, including bitcoin.  ""As we're seeing sharp volatility in domestic and overseas financial markets, it's necessary to maintain current levels of monetary easing for the time being,"" Uchida said in a speech to business leaders in Hakodate, Hokkaido.  Other things being equal, BOJ's latest comments mean limited downside in the cryptocurrency even as the death cross, characterized by the cryptocurrency's 50-day simple moving average (SMA) moving below the pivotal 200-day SMA, looms.  Bitcoin traded firm following Uchida's comments, briefly topping the $57,300 mark as the Japanese yen (JPY) depreciated to 148 per U.S. dollar (USD) from 145 per USD. Japan's equity index, Nikkei, rose 4%, signaling a risk reset, and futures tied to the S&P 500 rose 0.8%.  ""The BOJ struck the 'Yen put,' and the Nikkei will be driving the Nasdaq and S&P to their pre-selloff levels,"" pseudonymous market observer Global Macro said on X.  The yen carry trade involves taking out cheap yen-denominated loans and investing in high-yielding currencies like the Mexican peso and risk assets. The strategy has been quite popular in recent years as the Bank of Japan kept interest rates at zero while others, including the Fed, raised borrowing costs rapidly to combat inflation.  However, last Wednesday, the Japanese central bank raised rates, ditching the ultra-easy monetary policy for the first time in 17 years. The hawkish move triggered an unwinding of carry trades, causing broad-based risk aversion. BTC tanked from $66,000 to $50,000 in five days to Monday.  ""By July 16th, the equity markets and many other risky asset markets peaked. For whatever reason, these asset markets began to sell off. As the sell-off continued, recent entrants into the YCT [yen carry trade] saw their assets falling, and to be clear, that is almost always the driver of unwinds. But worse, the Yen began rallying slowly. That began the unwind,"" Andy Constan, CEO of Damped Spring Advisors, said in a detailed yen carry trade explainer on X.  ""The unwind of the trade results in inelastic price moving flow to buy Yen and sell risky assets. The sale of the risky asset also impacts the much bigger set of levered investors who don't have any yen exposure at all and they get margin called as well,"" Constan added.  11:29 UTC: Corrects Uchida's title to Deputy Governor.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/07/bitcoins-impending-death-cross-may-trap-bears-as-bank-of-japan-eases-rate-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4e9c6e7e9791ef77274df317fdadc4967a9388d0-6000x3375.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32112638,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633553,1723006819,Is Bitcoin Really Safe? New Insights from ‘Black Swan’ Author on Recent Crash,"Bitcoin has led a global crypto market downturn in the past few days, with the asset down to as low as $49,751 on August 5. This significant plunge from Bitcoin has been attributed by many to the downturn in the Japanese markets. The Trigger in Japan Speaking on the crash, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a risk analyst, author of “The Black Swan” and a well-known Bitcoin detractor, sheds light on the origins of the recent market disruptions that have rippled through to cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Could Bitcoin Outshine Gold? Trading Guru Weighs In On The Historic Financial Duel On Monday, the Japanese stock market fell severely, dropping by more than 10%. The report said this plunge came “amid risk from a stronger yen, tighter monetary policy, and concern over the US recession.” The narrative begins with Japan’s economic policies, where after maintaining zero interest rates for an unprecedented thirty-three years coupled with nearly two and a half decades of quantitative easing, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) found itself cornered into a position where adjustments seemed inevitable. The abrupt decision by the BOJ to raise interest rates led to a sharp downturn in the Nikkei 225, a major stock index, which in turn sent shockwaves across global markets, including the cryptocurrency sector. According to Taleb, this sharp pivot in policy was a long time coming, as the artificial suppression of interest rates and excessive liquidity injection often come with hefty long-term costs. The Japanese approach, often hailed as a successful quantitative easing model, now faces critical scrutiny as it appears the bill for years of economic manipulation is due. Taleb particularly noted in the post on X: Nearly 33 years of (near) Zero Interest Rates (ZIRP) and 23 years of Quantitative Easing come at a price you eventually must pay. (Japan was always mentioned by the QE fools as a place where the strategy worked). Is Bitcoin Safe? Bitcoin dipped to a 7-month low during the global market plunge, dropping below $50,000. This fall impacted the crypto market so much that the total liquidations surpassed $1 billion. Given this significant negative impact attributed to the plunge in the Japanese market, some might question if Bitcoin is still safe, especially as a safe haven. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin has since proved to be a digital asset worth considering as a safe haven when it comes to times like this. In March 2023, when major banks in the US were collapsing, Bitcoin saw a rise to as high as $29,000—a notable increase from its lowest levels below $20,000 that month. Besides, it is also worth noting that not only Bitcoin was a victim of the impact of this Japanese market crash, as several other major crypto assets, including Ethereum and Solana, experienced a drastic fall. For context, Ethereum fell as low as $2,197—a low not seen since January of this year; Solana also bore the brunt, dipping to $110. Aside from these major cryptocurrencies, traditional assets also received their share of impact, with Nvidia, Tesla, and Apple falling at least 4%.

32108883,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633509,1723001446,Chainlink (LINK) Recovers 20% As Network Lights Up With Activity,"Chainlink (LINK) has made a sharp 20% recovery from the crash during the past day, as the network has seen a spike in address activity. Chainlink Has Returned Above $9.8 After Recovery Rally The cryptocurrency sector had opened the week with a sharp crash, and Chainlink was no exception, as its price had slammed down towards the $8 level after being above the $11 mark during the weekend. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV Lowest Since FTX Crash, Signal To Buy? In the past day, the market has seen some respite, but LINK has particularly stood out with a surge of almost 20%, which has taken its price back above $9.8. The below chart shows what the recent trend in the asset has looked like. Out of the top 20 coins by market cap, only Solana (SOL) and Shiba Inu (INU) rival Chainlink in returns over the last 24 hours. Despite the big jump, though, LINK is still nowhere near making a full recovery from the recent downturn. Nonetheless, the surge would still provide some hope to its investors. As for the cause behind this recovery rally, perhaps on-chain data could provide some hints. LINK Daily Active Addresses Has Hit Highest Levels Since May According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, the LINK network has recently seen a surge in Daily Active Addresses. The “Daily Active Addresses” here refers to an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the number of Chainlink addresses participating in some transaction activity daily. The metric naturally includes both senders and receivers. The unique number of active addresses on the blockchain can be considered the same as the unique number of users participating in the network activity, so the indicator’s value tells us about the amount of traffic LINK is receiving right now. When the metric’s value is high, it means a large number of addresses are making moves on the network. Such a trend implies that interest in the asset is high among investors. On the other hand, the low indicator suggests that few are paying attention to cryptocurrency as there isn’t much trading activity on the chain. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Daily Active Addresses for Chainlink over the past few months: The graph shows that Chainlink saw a sharp surge in its Daily Active Addresses alongside the crash, implying that many users became active to make some transfers. Such a trend isn’t unusual during periods of volatility, with the activity usually corresponding to panic from the investors. This time around, however, things may have been different. Related Reading: Crypto Liquidations Cross $1 Billion As Bitcoin Crashes To $51,000 “Interestingly, this surge occurred alongside a general outflow from exchanges, suggesting accumulation during yesterday’s troubled market,” notes IntoTheBlock. With the latest spike, the Chainlink Daily Active Addresses has reached the highest level since May.

The price is trading below $2,640 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could rise steadily if it clears the $2,680 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Aims Higher Ground Ethereum price started a recovery wave after a nasty spike below the $2,000 level. ETH climbed above the $2,200 and $2,250 resistance levels like Bitcoin above $65,000. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,920 swing high to the $1,910 swing low. Moreover, there is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $2,440 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. However, the bears are active near the $2,540 and $2,550 levels. Ethereum price is still trading below $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near the $2,540 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $2,920 swing high to the $1,910 swing low. The first major resistance is near the $2,680 level and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. The next major hurdle is near the $2,720 level. A close above the $2,720 level might send Ether toward the $2,860 resistance. The next key resistance is near $2,920. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might send the price higher toward the $3,000 resistance zone in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,540 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near $2,440 and the trend line zone. The first major support sits near the $2,365 zone. A clear move below the $2,365 support might push the price toward $2,250. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,120 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,050.

32105034,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=633542,1722996001,Bitwise CIO Believes The Crypto Crash Sets The Stage For Bitcoin To Thrive – Key Reasons Why,"In the aftermath of a tumultuous week that saw Bitcoin (BTC) plummet to a seven-month low of $49,000 on Monday, global financial markets were rattled by a significant downturn, sparking concerns across stock exchanges and the crypto sphere. However, amid the chaos, Bitwise’s Chief Investment Officer Matt Hougan analyzed the drivers behind the recent market meltdown. He explained why he believes traders’ fears may be misplaced and that the market dip holds key opportunities for potential Bitcoin price appreciation. Crypto Crash Or Opportunity? In a recent note to investors, Hougan pointed to the broader market chaos, including a 12% single-day crash in Japan’s Nikkei index and a 4% tumble in Nasdaq futures, sparking the crypto selloff. He drew parallels to the market turmoil seen at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, when Bitcoin crashed 37% in a single day. “It felt as if we might never recover. The media claimed Bitcoin had failed its test as a hedge asset,” Hougan recalled. However, he noted that in the year following that crash, Bitcoin surged over 1,000% to new record highs of $57,322. Hougan believes a similar dynamic could play out this time, arguing that Bitcoin’s fundamental case remains intact, regardless of short-term price volatility. Related Reading: UNI Price Bounces Back 13% Above $5.6, Can Bulls Maintain Control? “Nothing fundamental had changed about Bitcoin because of Covid,” Hougan said. “The maximum number of Bitcoin that could exist (21 million) was the same on March 11 as on March 12. You didn’t need to rely on any bank, government, or company to store wealth in Bitcoin on March 11, which was still true on March 12.” Moreover, Hougan contends that the factors that propelled Bitcoin’s rise during the pandemic – the expansion of central bank intervention, the limitations of centralized institutions, and the growing digitization of the economy – are still in play today. Will Bitcoin Emerge Stronger? Hougan also acknowledged in his remarks the near-term uncertainty, noting that it remains unclear whether the crypto market has found its bottom yet. He pointed to the potential for further deleveraging and contagion risk among crypto firms as key monitoring factors. However, the Bitwise CIO urged investors to look past the short-term noise and focus on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. He warned against the temptation of market timing, reminding readers that “the four most expensive words in finance are ‘this time it’s different.'” Historically, Hougan said, crypto has tended to trade lower initially during periods of broader economic panic, only to end up higher over the following 12 months. He expressed confidence that the current market meltdown will be no exception and that Bitcoin will emerge stronger from the turmoil. “In fact, I’m betting the other way,” Hougan concluded. “Resist the urge to look at intraday prices, and focus instead on where Bitcoin could be next year, in five years, and in ten years.” Related Reading: Helium (HNT) Stays Afloat With 31% Gains Amid Crypto Market Mayhem When writing, the largest cryptocurrency on the market has climbed back to the $56,300 level, surging 4.5% in the last 24 hours.

Veteran Trader Predicts Rebound To $90,000","The Bitcoin crash may be over, as a crypto trader has predicted a significant rebound for the pioneer cryptocurrency, foreseeing Bitcoin soaring to new all-time highs of $90,000. This bullish projection comes amid the recent downtrend in the price of Bitcoin, which saw a dramatic crash below $50,000 at some point over the past few weeks. $90,000 Rebound Target Set For BTC In an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 5, crypto analyst, Peter Brandt made a bold prediction, suggesting that Bitcoin could witness a significant rebound to $90,000 this bull cycle. Sharing a price chart depicting a series of pumps and dumps in Bitcoin’s value since the beginning of the year, Brandt foresees the pioneer cryptocurrency hitting $90,000 before the end of 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Sees Sharp 24% Drop, Where Does Price Go From Here? During his post, Brandt emphasized the importance of focusing on what could potentially happen (possibilities), rather than what is likely to happen (probabilities) or what is believed to be certain (certainties). This unique approach to analyzing the market avoids over-dependence on assumptions and remains flexible to various market results. Seeking Brandt’s opinion on the current state of the market, a crypto community member shared that they have been forecasting a bull flag for Bitcoin over the past few months. They inquired if Brandt concurred with this prediction and if a Bitcoin has reached a golden pocket, a key Fibonacci retracement level that often signals the next potential resistance level. Responding to the crypto community member, Brandt negated the possibility of a Bitcoin bull flag, citing various technical analytical authorities such as Schabacker, Edwards, and Magee, who state that bull flags should not last longer than two months. This ultimately suggests that if a supposed bull flag pattern has persisted for more than two months, then it does not meet the criteria for a bull flag. Additionally, when asked by another crypto member if a possibility was just a type of probability, Brandt clarified that possibilities could not be described as a probability because probabilities involve assigning numbers and making assumptions. Brandt has disclosed that he strictly avoids trades based on assumptions to remain open to all possible outcomes without bias. Bitcoin Regains Strength After 23% Market Crash Before Brandt predicted a rebound to $90,000 for Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency had experienced a sharp decline in its price. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s price had fallen to around $52,000, marking a significant drop of more than 23%, according to CoinMarketCap.

The cryptocurrency appears to be breaking out of its previous bearish trends, steadily approaching previous price highs around the $60,000 mark. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $55,903.
