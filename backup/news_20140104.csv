42425238,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfTh,1388853232,"Bitcoin Isn't Evil, and Here's What Gives it Value","American economist Paul Krugman recently asked a valid question that is on the minds of many other bitcoin sceptics: where does the value of bitcoin as a unit (BTC) comes from?  Yes, bitcoin can be a wonderful technology to transfer ownership of these units, but why should they be worth $1, $1,000 or $1,000,000?  Krugman wrote in his piece titled 'Bitcoin Is Evil':  ""… when I try to get them to explain to me why BitCoin [sic] is a reliable store of value, they always seem to come back with explanations about how it’s a terrific medium of exchange. Even if I buy this (which I don’t, entirely), it doesn’t solve my problem. And I haven’t been able to get my correspondents to recognize that these are different questions.""    Fred Ehrsam from Coinbase responded with a sophisticated version of what most bitcoiners tell people when explaining why bitcoin is a valuable asset. The usual response is that bitcoin is worth something because of its awesome transacting capabilities. He wrote in his piece titled 'Bitcoin Is Good':      ""In the present, the value of bitcoin as a currency can be viewed as the sum of the cost savings of using the bitcoin network for payments rather than alternative payment networks.      If 1.00 bitcoin is currently used for 10 transactions a year with an average value of $100, the bitcoin network is three percent cheaper than the average next best alternative, and this dynamic is maintained for 10 years, multiplying these arbitrary sample inputs values 1.00 bitcoin at $300. This does not require bitcoin to replace existing local currencies.""    In my opinion, this is not really a satisfactory answer. To trade something of value it must have some value beforehand. So saying that it is valuable because it's so efficient to trade is circular logic.  Consider this example: if Fred uses the bitcoin network just to move his dollars around, the actual value of the whole BTC supply is irrelevant to him. It could be $1 per coin or $10,000. He would still move the same $100 and get back $100 (provided volatility is not too high during the turnaround).  Similarly, all other awesome applications – secure timestamping, name systems, smart contracts, etc – all are equally possible regardless of how much one bitcoin is worth.  So what gives BTC value?  In the first year of bitcoin, there were almost no transactions, but people were spending their energy on generating bitcoins. The only two reasons that come in my mind are:  Value as a collectible, in a similar manner to people collecting rare metals, stones, shells, postal stamps, paintings and baseball cards.  Value from betting that other people may find these collectibles valuable and thus would have to buy some of them from earlier collectors, thus making them richer.  Gold is valuable for the exact same reason. Not because it's shiny (many things are), but because it's rare, durable and mobile, and thus can be collected. And once collected, it can only increase in value when more people want it.  Once the collectible gets some value, it can become money. Once bitcoins became valuable, you could take advantage of the beautiful transfer network. But it always stays the same network: whether a hundred people use it or millions. So the network can't be responsible for any single price that people put on bitcoin.  Believers  Most bitcoiners love the technical beauty of the technology and feel bad about acknowledging that the price depends solely on the amount of ""believers"". All of them individually base their beliefs on the technical features, but there is no measurable way to deduce fair amount of ""faith"" from the technical properties.  Everyone decides individually how much money and time they want to sacrifice for their beliefs. Fred Wilson, for instance, likes technology very much, but does not (as he has previously admitted) own a lot of coins.On the other hand, some people invested without a clear understanding what bitcoin is, but just because it sounded cool.  There's clearly no rational way to tell how much money bitcoin ""should be worth"" today or tomorrow. Additionally, deducing value of bitcoin based on circulation metrics is faulty from the start as ""circulation"" does not really exist and all transfers happen only insofar as money already has some value to people. And then, frequency of transactions is independent from the total value of the supply. Bitcoins are frequently traded simply because they can be, but valued because they are valued. Gold is not traded that often, but it is still valued many times more than bitcoin.  For more insight regarding collectibles and early history of money please see the excellent article by Nick Szabo.  In the end, bitcoin is valuable as a collectible. Its reliability as a ""store of value"" depends on the number of people willing to hold it. The more people believe in the seriousness of bitcoin, the more they will add to this belief in the form of infrastructure around it, increasing people’s confidence about it even further.

42425249,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfrh,1388848051,Chinese Web Giant Sina Launches Bitcoin Information Pages,"Sina.com.cn, China's fourth most-popular web portal, yesterday launched Sina Bitcoin Market information pages with charts, statistics and real-time market quotes.  Sina announced the launch by saying the service was created to assist investors in understanding and discussing bitcoin market trends and relevant market knowledge. It features data gathered from Mt. Gox (USD-BTC), BTC China (CNY-BTC), and 11 more of the largest bitcoin trading platforms. It said the site aimed to be easy to use and understand, and welcomed user suggestions.  Initial reports said the response from users was mainly positive.  Sina is sometimes called ""the Yahoo! of China"". Given the nature of large online and media businesses in China, any sign of bitcoin endorsement from a company as prominent as Sina can spark optimism. The same signs were noted after state media CCTV's documentaries on bitcoin earlier in 2013. It suggests that decision-makers at some levels of China's official hierarchy appear to find value in bitcoin.  Although based in mainland China, Sina's online services are aimed at Chinese-speaking communities around the world and it has over 100 million registered users. The company also operates properties like microblogging platform Sina Weibo, Sina.net, Sina Online and Chinese mobile carrier Sina Mobile.  China has bewildered many outsiders with its regulatory statements and actions of the past month; seeming to both allow widespread access to bitcoin while simultaneously clamping down on access to entry and exit points – but not always enthusiastically.  Officially, the Chinese authorities have forbidden any financial institutions from setting bitcoin prices or dealing in digital currencies, and blocked third-party payment processors from exchanges. People are still allowed to speculate and trade them, with several of the usual warnings about associated risks.  The formerly largest exchange BTC China has moved to a voucher system to facilitate payments. Other exchanges like Huobi, chbtc.com and FXbtc, however, are reportedly still receiving deposits in CNY via wire transfers.  The uncertainty has had an effect on bitcoin prices over the past month. Bitcoin was at an all-time high of over $1,200 on 4th December, but lost 50% of that value after the People's Bank announcements. It has recently climbed closer to the thousand dollar mark again, but any news from a country the size of China causes fluctuations.  At the time of writing, 1 BTC was trading for 4,710 CNY ($778.4) on BTC China and 4,728 CNY on Huobi.com.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2014/01/04/chinese-web-giant-sina-launches-bitcoin-information-pages,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0b6747bf3c1c372d74860108cbff78ae2b3b2494-744x534.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425245,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvfdh,1388839770,Malaysian Central Bank Has No Plans To Regulate Bitcoin,"Malaysia's Central Bank, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), joined others by publishing its own statement on bitcoin this week.  The statement was similar to those issued in other countries of late, but probably the briefest we've seen from a central bank so far. An announcement, posted on the bank's official website, simply said:  ""The bitcoin is not recognised as legal tender in Malaysia. The Central Bank does not regulate the operations of bitcoin. The public is therefore advised to be cautious of the risks associated with the usage of such digital currency.""  There has been a flurry of similar statements around the world in the past week, from countries as far apart as Lebanon and New Zealand. All, however, have stressed two main points: bitcoin cannot be recognized as a ""currency"", and using it carries certain risks.  It is still unknown to what degree these statements indicate central banks internationally are washing their hands of all bitcoin-related responsibility, or whether they signal the opening moves of an eventual crackdown.  CoinDesk spoke to Colbert Low, the founder of local services and consultancy firm BitcoinMalaysia.com, about whether the central bank's statement would change anything. He said:    ""Nothing changes, there are still plenty of bitcoin/altcoin trades going on.      Our secret traders' groups on [messaging platforms] Whatsapp and Kakaotalk are still going strong, with 200 plus people. ASIC (SHA256) hardware sales are also strong and there's plenty of demand from miners in Malaysia.""    Low compared the BNM's stance to that of the neighboring Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) last month. After originally warning investors to ""be wary"" of bitcoin in September, the authority announced later it would not regulate it at all, saying: ""Whether or not businesses accept bitcoins in exchange for their goods and services is a commercial decision in which MAS does not intervene.""  Malaysia shares similar traits with Singapore in that it has a healthy supply of young IT professionals (both on the hardware and software side) and also serves as a regional hub for financial services, making it attractive ground for digital currency developers as well.  In July 2013, Thailand's central bank became the first to make strong statements about bitcoin's legal status, using the word ""illegal"" repeatedly to denounce bitcoin trading and use in exchange for goods and services. Some local exchanges suspended business in response.  Some claimed the news was misreported and/or exaggerated, and Thailand maintains a healthy bitcoin scene with at least two exchanges, Bahtcoin and CoinMill, still operating. The latter site carries a note that there are restrictions on trading Thai Baht, and offshore banks may only trade Thai Offshore Baht (THO). CoinMill has a calculator for current baht-bitcoin exchange rates.

42376795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6eRa1,1388821053,Games Giant Zynga Starts Playing With Bitcoin,"Social gaming giant Zynga has announced that it will be accepting bitcoin for in-app payments in selected games, as a ""test"" with payment processor BitPay. The move opens up $200m per quarter in potential markets for the digital currency.  The Zynga team account posted the following on reddit:    ""The Bitcoin test is only available to Zynga.com players playing FarmVille 2, CastleVille, ChefVille, CoasterVille, Hidden Chronicles, Hidden Shadows and CityVille. The games can be accessed at http://zynga.com.      Zynga is always working to improve our customer experience by incorporating player feedback into our games. We look forward to hearing from our players about the Bitcoin test so we can continue in our efforts to provide the best possible gaming experience.""    Sources connected to BitPay and Zynga users quickly confirmed the announcement as true.  It might also be worth mentioning that Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, who contributed to Zynga's Series A and B funding rounds in 2008-09, also both have a stake in bitcoin payment processor and wallet service Coinbase.  Zynga is among a new generation of companies focused on social gaming. These games, which often piggyback on existing social networks, draw users into addictive play sessions, in which they can compete and collaborate with their friends.  Zynga’s revenue comes in two forms: direct payments in games, and revenue from partners. Direct payments are made inside games to buy assets that can help players to compete.  Reddit user 'betafall' posted this video showing the simplicity of making a bitcoin purchase within a Zynga game:  The firm also announced a push into real money gaming, releasing ZyngaPlusPoker and ZyngaPlusCasino in the UK in early 2013. In the US, it announced that it would pursue a real money gaming license, but in July, it backtracked on the decision, ending its real money gaming efforts in America.  Zynga has a turbulent history when it comes to the use of alternative currencies for in-app purchases. In 2010, the company reportedly threatened to end its relationship with Facebook after the social networking giant tried to force it into using its own virtual currency, the now-defunct Facebook Credits, for purchases inside its games. Had that deal gone ahead, Facebook would have pocketed 30% of all in-game payments made to Zynga on Facebook-hosted games.  The companies overcame their dispute and signed a five-year contract, but Zynga also started its own Zynga With Friends network, which connects players of its games from various platforms. It also created a Zynga API allowing developers to create social games on its network.  Founded in 2008, the company went public in December 2011. Last year was tough for Zynga – in July, figures emerged suggesting it had lost almost half of its user base in the course of a year.  Zynga’s casual, mobile-friendly market stands in contrast to the traditional console game market, in which sprawling, complex games often rival Hollywood movies in budget and production time. In the console sector, companies have moved away from virtual currency. Microsoft, for example, abandoned its Points system earlier this year, returning instead to straightforward fiat currency for purchases, made via credit cards.  Taking bitcoin as an in-game currency would bring several benefits, ventured Jeffrey Green, “The benefits would be to give the user another payment option. Give the user what he wants, so to speak,” said Green, who wrote an analysis of virtual currencies launched by large online firms when at Mercator Advisory Group. He explained:  “The challenge would be the volatility of bitcoins and what their worth might be when exchanged for dollars. Volume wouldn't be very high, but there likely will be gamers out there looking for something novel to try.”  There is also the commission to consider. PayPal charges commission on payments, and although big fish like Zynga may get a discount, bitcoin’s low-to-no transaction fees are difficult to argue with.  There are, however, negative aspects to using bitcoin for in-game payments. Notably, the virtual currency doesn’t yet allow for recurring payments, which could be useful in social gaming.
