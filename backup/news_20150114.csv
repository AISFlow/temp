42398133,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWOU,1421277963,"Tim Draper, Nas Back Bitcoin API Maker BlockCypher in $3 Million Round","BlockCypher has raised more than $3m in a seed-funding round that will allow it to expand its operations in Europe and Asia.  Tim Draper  and Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang’s AME Cloud Ventures are among the many that invested in the round. Other participants included Boost VC, 500 Startups, Crypto Currency Partners, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), hip-hop artist and VC Nasir Jones, Jesse Draper and Shawn Byers.  With this latest round of funding Blockcypher said it can now seek to provide customers deeper analytics while continuing to build services and invest in scaling and security. The round coincides with the company’s release of an open-source block explorer that will showcase four different cryptocurrencies – bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin and BlockCypher Testnet.  BlockCypher CEO and co-founder Catheryne Nicholson also sought to paint the funding round as one that will find the company improving its technology.  Nicholson told CoinDesk:  “Using the BlockCypher Web Services, developers can expect reliable operations, very innovative APIs, the ability to scale as they need and they also get deep understanding of the technology powering cryptocurrencies at their service.”  The funding coincides with an uptick in offerings from cryptocurrency API providers, with CEX.io, Chain, Coinbase and Neuroware all making headlines in recent weeks.  Focus on blockchain applications  Many of BlockCypher’s investors spoke to the company’s focus on technology, the potential of the blockchain and the future of blockchain applications.  Most took an agnostic approach, choosing to highlight not simply bitcoin, but more specifically its underlying distributed ledger technology.  “We think one of the most promising areas in bitcoin is in the blockchain technology layer,” said Foundation Capital general partner Charles Moldow. “It’s where the greatest innovation is happening and it’s at the core of BlockCypher’s expertise.”  NEA partner Rick Yang also emphasized how developers will be empowered by the company's offerings using a similar wording.  “BlockCypher has built the only cloud-optimized blockchain technology layer, allowing developers and large enterprises to easily build and adopt blockchain technology,"" he said.  2014 was a breakthrough year for the blockchain, bringing much of the excitement around its abilities and possibilities for ledger-based applications. PeerNova, HashRabbit, Blockstream and BlockScore are just some of the many emerging startups working to utilize the blockchain for more than bitcoin transactions.  Nicholson, too, emphasized the blockchain in her comments, adding:  “Most of the time in software you see improvements or iterations on existing frameworks but very seldom do you see brand-new technology like blockchains.""  Zero-confirmation transactions  According to the company, BlockCypher Web Services is currently processing half a million events and customers worldwide daily.  Unsurprisingly, it has attracted fans of its offerings, including Brian Gamido, CEO of Philippine remittance company Paladin.  “I like their ability to quickly innovate and integrate cutting-edge blockchain features into their solution,"" Gamido said.  One such feature is the company’s 'confidence factor', which, Nicholson said, “is only a taste of things to come”.  The zero-confirmation confidence factor, a signature BlockCypher product, allows merchants to process bitcoin transactions within seconds, instead of hours, and with 99.99% confidence.  “Our back-end is powered by our own full-node blockchain daemon that's been optimized for scale and reliability in large cloud deployments,” she said. “This gives us a lot of control in what we can build as we're directly plugged in the peer-to-peer networks.”  Daniel Cawrey contributed reporting.

42398134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWKY,1421276147,CoinTerra CEO: Company 'Frozen' Amid Lawsuits and Default,"Following a lengthy silence in the media, CoinTerra CEO Ravi Iyengar has emerged on the offensive, seeking to clarify the current state of his bitcoin mining firm, one that has recently been rocked by questions about its solvency.  Speaking to CoinDesk as part of a new interview, Iyengar confirmed that the Austin-based bitcoin mining company is in default, and it is currently awaiting a decision from its secured note holders.  CoinTerra is in default on roughly $4.25m-worth of secured notes, according to Iyengar. The admission comes days after the firm became the target of a lawsuit filed by data center services provider C7 Data Centers. CoinTerra has launched a countersuit, contesting Utah-based C7’s allegations of unjust enrichment and breach of contract.  Iyengar asserted that a halt in bitcoin mining at C7’s data centers resulted in a default event for CoinTerra, telling CoinDesk:  “At this point in time, things are kind of frozen. Until the next steps are clear, you know, there’s not a whole lot progress we can make.”  The CEO declined to offer specifics on a potential deal, citing non-disclosure agreements.  Indications that CoinTerra was experiencing debt problems first emerged earlier this month. Iyengar said in an interview that situation has effectively left CoinTerra ""frozen"" as it pursues solutions with its debt holders.  Problems not anticipated  Complicating the company's current situation is that CoinTerra began accepting preorders for its planned 16nm AIRE Miner in September.  Iyengar said that at the time CoinTerra didn’t foresee the problems it is currently experiencing today, arguing that his company’s fortunes shifted as the price of bitcoin fell over the course of 2014 and network difficulty climbed.  He explained:  ""Things were going well. We had many different meetings, in terms of investment opportunities and all that, so there was no indication at that time whatsoever that things [would worsen].""  Throughout the interview, Iyengar strived to paint CoinTerra as the victim of larger market forces.  “Who would predict the downfall that bitcoin has taken, in terms of price and difficulty and all that?” he continued. “A lot of things have happened that were not foreseen.”  The legal complications, as well as the default, have put initiatives such as its next-generation mining ASICs in limbo, and Iyengar said that, like other parts of the business, its too early to suggest how that work might continue.  Awaiting debt decision  When asked about CoinTerra’s next move, Iyengar said that there are several factors, including the health and future of the bitcoin network itself, that will play into the final decision made by its debt holders.  Until then, Iyengar acknowledged, the company’s future remains uncertain.  He suggested that owners of the company’s debt are likely examining the current price of bitcoin – $182 at the time of writing – as well as any other variables as they weigh the plan put forward by CoinTerra, explaining:  “I’m sure the note holders are looking at everything, the situation in the market. So, it all depends on how they move.”  “It’s hard to predict,” he concluded.

42398125,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWFd,1421269061,Next US Marshals Bitcoin Auction Could Be Held in Q1,"The US Marshals Service (USMS) has revealed that its next bitcoin auction could take place in the first quarter of 2015.  The federal agency tasked with managing assets seized during criminal investigations has to date auctioned off nearly 80,000 BTC confiscated in the FBI's shutdown of now-infamous online black market Silk Road.  The USMS did not reveal further details about the timing to CoinDesk, stating only:  “We do anticipate that we will hold another bitcoin auction in the first quarter of this year.  The agency also declined to elaborate further on ongoing plans for upcoming auctions, including how many bitcoins may be auctioned off or if the price of bitcoin would be considered when deciding the timing of the sale.  The USMS previously revealed that it had timed its most recent auction of 50,000 BTC in part to avoid market disruption.  In conversation, however, a spokesperson from the agency stressed that this is only the anticipated date, and that plans for the auction could change.  In the coming months, the USMS is expected to sell 94,336 BTC, worth $17.5m at press time, as it liquidates the remainder of the bitcoins previously held by Ulbricht, who only yesterday admitted to founding Silk Road as an “economic experiment”.

42398123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWDf,1421260223,Bitcoin's Twitterati React to Price Decline,"The bitcoin price crashed below $200 on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index earlier today, dropping to $179.13 before rebounding.  Unsurprisingly, the price collapse has set off a whirlwind of conversation about the future of the bitcoin network, both within and outside the community.  Regular bitcoiners have been reeling at what the news means for their digital currency holdings, while traders have welcomed the return to volatility and exchange volumes have surged to their highest levels since November 2014.  At press time the price stood at $184.  While the $200 mark is likely a significant mental threshold for many bitcoin investors, the lower price is also notable, as it comes in just under ¥1,000 Chinese yuan – the currency credited with being involved in over half of the total bitcoin trade.  Acknowledging the extreme price movements, prominent figures from within the bitcoin community took to Twitter to share their thoughts.  Community reactions  With prices dropping but difficulty still high, many miners are at crisis point.  Author and advocate Andreas Antonopoulos sent out the following prophetic tweet two days ago.    Evolution of the dynamic difficulty of bitcoin mining as the price declines and profits turn into losses. A difficulty plateau coming?      — AndreasMAntonopoulos (@aantonop) January 12, 2015    New York-based founder of Digital Currency Group and creator of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, Barry Silbert, joined the conversation as the situation unfolded late yesterday.  His tweet, although brief, created a flurry of debate among his followers:    Capitulation      — Barry Silbert (@barrysilbert) January 13, 2015    Silbert's blunt message was followed by one from Roger Ver, a prominent investor in various bitcoin startups, who referenced the Silk Road Trial's possible effect on the price fluctuation.    I suspect the Bitcoin price has been dropping in anticipation of the Feds selling 100K more bitcoins in light of the #SilkRoadTrial news.      — Roger Ver (@rogerkver) January 14, 2015    The Wall Street Journal's tech columnist, Christopher Mims, was quick to link the effect of recent events elsewhere in the financial world and the price decline.

42398129,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWIa,1421244429,Bitcoin Foundation Launches Event Series to Boost Core Development,"The Bitcoin foundation will hold the first of a series of roundtable discussions for developers in Boston next month.  The organisation, which has recently narrowed down its activities, said the event is for developers interested in deepening their technical expertise to support the future development of Bitcoin Core.  Gavin Andresen  , chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation spoke about the need for the event, saying:  ""The biggest challenge for bitcoin startups right now is finding technical talent who understands the blockchain technology. Whatever your skill level or interest, this event will give you a solid grounding in Bitcoin Core and how you can contribute.""  The event, titled Devcore Boston: Developing the Developers, will be held on 11th February at District Hall, 75 Northern Avenue, Boston.  Devcore Boston will include a 'Quick Hacks' workshop, training and certification, consulting sessions with law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, panel discussions with leading technical experts, an in-depth Q&A with Bitcoin Core developers and networking opportunities.  Sean Neville, CTO and co-founder of Circle, the title sponsor of the event said: ""Bitcoin's ongoing maturity toward massive mainstream volume depends on attracting more people to code, test, debate and generally innovate in its open meritocracy,"" adding that ""these roundtables help developers cross that threshold"".  Shift in focus  The news comes after the organisation declared that it was going to wind down its education, outreach and public policy initiatives as it turned its focus to core development in November last year.  This decision followed the publication of three surveys conducted by the Bitcoin Foundation, which focused on businesses, individuals and the general public.  Fourty-four percent of the Bitcoin's Foundation's individual members supported the trade organisation's decision to focus more on core development, constituting 106 out of a total of 230 respondents.  Fifty-two percent of individual members said that supporting the development of bitcoin's open-source technology, was to them, the most important part of the organization's work.  Additionally, similar findings were found in the community and business member surveys, with 56% and 44% of respondents respectively supporting core development.

42398137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWRR,1421242699,Global Bitcoin Trade Volume Surges on 15% Price Decline,"As the bitcoin price plunged below the $200 mark, hitting a low of $170.08, holders of the cryptocurrency sold the asset in a surge of millions of orders across bitcoin exchanges globally.      With the price teetering on the brink of the $200 level around 07:20 (GMT), global exchange trading volume began to pick up. The number of trades per minute executed on exchanges tripled, from around 1,000 to 3,370 at its peak, according to data from Bitcoinity.      As trading velocity spiked, the total amount of volume hitting exchange order books grew to a high of 183,000 BTC (roughly $36.6m).      While trading surged, however, the bitcoin price nose-dived below $200, losing about $30. It hit a low at 07:44am, 15 minutes after the selloff began.      The bitcoin markets this morning were in ""total capitulation"", said trader Alistair Milne of the Altana Digital Currency Fund.      He added:      ""If this isn't what total capitulation looks like, I don't know what does.""            Busiest day since November    Bitcoin exchanges had their busiest day since November, when the price rallied from around $320 to hit a high of $427 in just two weeks. That rally saw 1.72 million coins changed hands. Just over a million coins have changed hands today so far.      Some of that trading volume has been generated by the burgeoning sector ofdigital currency hedge funds. Bitcoin's recent return to volatility has been a bonanza for them.      One trader, Harry Yeh at Binary Financial, recounted trading over 20,000 BTC (about $6m) in a single marathon 20-hour session last month. He said today's market action was getting close to that level.      ""This is probably the best day of trading,"" he said. ""I've been trading for about 10 hours already.""    Swaps activityhttp://bfxdata.com/sentiment/longshort.php on Bitfinex, the largest US dollar exchange by volume, shows speculators split between longs and shorts.    Current hourly swaps shows shorts with 67% of the market, although longs had a 57% share at around 10:00, as the price rose. At press time, total active swaps still showed longs dominating, with a 76.6% share.      With the US East Coast still getting out of bed, exchange order books likely have a frenzied day to come.    Rough ride ahead    The question hanging over the bitcoin markets remains: did the price find a bottom at the $170 mark, or will it plumb even greater depths? Conversely if a bottom has been found, what will be the rate of a rebound?      Buyers may be found with bitcoin at prices not seen since the autumn of 2013. Money is waiting on the sidelines to enter the market at current prices, Yeh says.      ""We have a lot more higher net-worth clients looking at bitcoin now and seeing the price dip as a buying opportunity,"" he said.      For others, like Altana's Milne, making a call on the price at this stage remains premature. His only advice to cryptocurrency traders in today's market is be prepared for a rough ride.      He said:      ""It is very possible we have seen the bottom, however nothing in today's market is logical. Whatever your position, strap yourself in!""

42398141,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSWVN,1421229511,"Bitcoin Price Continues to Fall, Breaking Through $200 Barrier","The bitcoin price fell below the landmark $200 point at 07:24 (GMT) today, putting it back into territory not seen since late 2013.  Within five minutes of crossing that threshold it had plunged further to $185. Less than 15 minutes after that, it fell to $179.13.  The latter price is significant as it lies just below 1,000 Chinese yuan, the currency involved in 65% of bitcoin trades, possibly crossing a lesser-acknowledged psychological barrier.  At press time, the price had rebounded somewhat to $205.54.  Gox-like prices  The last time the bitcoin price crossed the $200 line was in late October 2013, heading in the opposite direction on its rocket-like rise to the all-time high of over $1,100.  The only time the bitcoin price has been anything like so low since then was within the walled garden of Mt Gox, after the exchange had stopped bitcoin withdrawals in February 2014. In the world outside, the price did not drop below the mid-$500s.  Holders looking to spend their bitcoins can now only dream of such purchasing power returning in the near future as miners produce bitcoins at a rate of 25 coins every 10 minutes and payment processors convert coins instantly to fiat to shield merchants from price uncertainty.  A sub-$200 bitcoin is bound to have an emotional effect not only on bitcoin users and speculators, but also cryptocurrency's opponents in the media, some of whom have been reporting bitcoin's death since 2011 with almost parental finger-wagging.  Mining conundrum  Although most of the focus over the past 48 hours was on the price of bitcoin, the hash rate has also experienced a massive drop, followed by a fast recovery late Tuesday. According to Blockchain charts, the hash rate went from 358,478,281 GH/s to 229,513,534 GH/s yesterday, before recovering to about 300,000,000 GH/s.  The problem is clear – the combination of a high difficulty level and low prices means mining is simply no longer profitable. The current difficulty level is 43,971,662,056.09 and was adjusted just a couple of days ago. This means that it will be at least two weeks before the network readjusts to a new difficulty rate.  However, it all depends on the time between blocks, which went up to more than 12 minutes last night, dropping to under 11 minutes this morning. If more miners decide to cut their losses and pull the plug, the time will go up again, resulting in an even longer wait for the next difficulty adjustment.  Mining revenue is simply too low to sustain the network at this price point and miners are faced with a tough choice – if they decide to power down, the next difficulty level will be attained later, but if they keep going, they will continue bleeding money. If the price does not recover, both scenarios are damaging to miners and bitcoin in general.  Low prices to remain?  Many of those who decide to keep mining at a loss will be forced to unload their bitcoins as soon as possible, at any price, just to cover part of their expenses. This will increase supply of cheap BTC in the short run, depressing prices even further.  If a significant number of miners decide to halt operations, we could see a substantial drop in the difficulty rate, but not in two weeks – depending on the size of the cut, it could be much longer.  It is a vicious cycle, as the hashing power will still be there and many will be eager to pounce as soon as the difficulty drops. This could in turn increase the next difficulty level and repeat the cycle once again, introducing even more volatility and uncertainty into an already shaken system.
