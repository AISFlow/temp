42397641,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDh3t,1401314421,How Bitislands Plans to Turn All of Bali into 'Bitcoin Paradise',"Tourists traveling to the tropical holiday island of Bali would ""only need to bring bitcoin"" under a new initiative called 'Bitislands' that is aiming to convince all local businesses to accept the digital currency, including money changers.  While there are several moves to create 'Bitcoin Boulevards' around the world in certain neighborhoods, this is the first attempt to convert an entire island.  The social experiment is sponsored by Bitcoin.co.id (also known as Bitcoin Indonesia), Indonesia's largest exchange and bitcoin lobby group.  Bitcoin Indonesia's co-founder and CEO Oscar Darmawan spoke to CoinDesk about the project, saying:  ""We will show to the world that bitcoin can be a better money; as a first step we will convert Bali into Bitcoin Paradise Island.""  Community support  Darmawan noted that all prominent Indonesian bitcoin startups have backed the project, and other international companies from around the Southeast Asian region have added their names as well.  To date, this list of companies includes Artabit, CoinPip, Quantified, Coin of Sale, Tukarcash and Bitwyre.  On Bitislands' advisory board are notable local and expat entrepreneurs and investors, including producer of the ""Life on Bitcoin"" documentaryhttp://lifeonbitcoin.com/ Christian Hsieh, Quantified Assets CEO Ville Oehman, CEO of Indonesia's biggest internet marketing forum Ricky Andrian, and the organizer of 'Ubud Breakfast with Bitcoin' events Gary Dykstra.  Gaining a foothold  The project's first goal is to set up an office and Bitcoin Information Center in Bali, and the island's first offline bitcoin exchange. To show how serious a project Bitislands is, Bitcoin Indonesia's CTO and other co-founder William Sutanto has relocated to Bali to personally oversee operations.  Bitcoin promises to spare travelers the headaches of having to change currency at every destination, like exchange rate ripoffs, money changer fees, the need for constant mental price conversions and others.  The Bitislands team is inviting bitcoin fans worldwide to support the initiative through donations, spreading the word and even volunteering in Bali itself.  Attracting entrepreneurs  Bali is probably a more perfect location for mass bitcoin adoption than most would assume.  Once known as a haven for surfers and hippies, the island's image has shifted over time to that of a more mainstream tourist destination, popular especially with travelers and party-goers from Australia and Japan.  More recently, though, it has begun to attract digital nomads and other entrepreneurs from around the world as the perfect place to run a laptop-based startup.  Bali's warm climate and relaxed, low-cost lifestyle appeals to location-independent developers who only need to meet with co-workers and clients in person a few times a year, if ever.  This situation has created a thriving startup ecosystem, generating even more interest in the area. There are already a few entrepreneurial co-working spaces there, including Hubud in the town of Ubud, The Sanur Space in Sanur, and the offices of web design and marketing company Lumonata in main center Kuta.

42397657,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhDj,1401312917,"Darkcoin Price in Turmoil Following Emergency Fork, Network Issues","Serious problems with a central structural component of the darkcoin network resulted in an emergency fork earlier this week, a development that triggered a broad selloff in the community.  Darkcoin  employs masternodes to bundle anonymized transactions and boost efficiency and security within the network. However, a bug in the code resulted in a series of forks that disrupted payments and forced exchanges to freeze trading while a hard fork was put in place by the darkcoin team.  The price of DRK reached an all-time average high of $15 on 25th May. At press time, however, the price of 1 DRK hovered around $9.50, although price swings have seen it fall as low as $8.  Darkcoin developer Evan Duffield said in a statement published on the Darkcoin Talk forum that while the cause is not fully understood, a fix is in the works:  ""This was either due to an intentional attack on the network or an issue with the masternode payments system, in either case we have a solution for masternode payments that will be safe for the network in the future.""  Darkcoin has fallen to sixth place in terms of overall market cap, according to Coinmarketcap.com, dropping from third place late last week.  Changes to masternode payments  Masternodes in the darkcoin network previously received 10% of block payments as an incentive for operators to run them. According to Duffield, these payments will now increase to 20% of each block reward:  ""We've wanted to increase masternode payments to 20% for a few weeks now, but have not been able to since the code was already going through the testing and launch stages. This will give us an opportunity to add greater incentive to secure the network and run masternodes.""  Duffield added that community concerns over how masternode payment changes were being conducted had been heeded, saying that ""we've decided the community is correct and will be using the same model as before to implement the hard forks.""  Development team expands  Notably, Duffield announced that a new development team will be formed to tackle later implementations of darkcoin, as well as work on the DarkSend transaction anonymizer, explaining:  “This should allow us to move at a similar pace of development with much greater quality. The next version of DarkSend is scheduled to be released at the end of June.”  Duffield also said that any interested developers should contact the darkcoin team to get involved.  Interest remains  These potentially troubling developments come during a period of rising interest in darkcoin, as evidenced by the coin's massive upswing in price and market attention. Darkcoin was recently profiled by Wired and International Business Times, among other publications.  Earlier this week, noted bitcoin investor and finance personality Max Keiser even remarked that darkcoin is ""clearly going to be a huge winner"" during a show that addressed the rising popularity of the altcoin.    #darkcoin at these prices = great buy.      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) May 26, 2014    For more on how an increasing interest in anonymity has helped popularize the coin, read our most recent report.

The reimbursement plan was put in motion by Silk Road 2.0 after the site suffered a serious hack in February that resulted in the loss of 4,476 BTC in customer funds ($2.6m at then-market prices). Undeterred, Silk Road 2.0 proposed a seven-point plan that would find moderators going without payment and the site charging a markup on purchases to recoup the losses.  Moderator Defcon issued a lengthy statement on a community forum and reposted on Deep Dot Web regarding the status of the plan on 27th May, saying that 82% of customer funds have been repaid thus far, adding:  ""In less than 30 days, I will be drafting an unprecedented announcement that your resilience made possible: the announcement that Silk Road has repaid all victims of our February hack.""  In late April, the Silk Road 2.0 moderator indicated that all customers could be expected to have received compensation for lost funds by 18th June. That news followed the announcement that 50% of hack victims had been repaid as of 8th April.  Defcon ended the message by claiming that Silk Road 2.0 cannot release exact user counts or BTC sales figures, citing ""security reasons"".  Revolutionary message  Defcon framed the announcement as a vindication of his operation, which has faced criticism since the initial hack, stating:  ""We are sending a clear message of integrity and justice, louder than the slander our oppressors can push into the news. History will prove that we are not criminals, we are revolutionaries.""  Defcon also took aim at ""economic oppression"", contrasting the actions of Silk Road 2.0 with economic giants like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, which Defcon criticized for ""steal[ing] the people's money"".  Updated sales  As noted by recent research, Silk Road 2.0 has become larger than even the original Silk Road at the time the website was seized by US law enforcement officials.  Still, Silk Road 2.0 has seen setbacks. Defcon noted that sales figures have still yet to recover, and that volume currently totals just 68% of pre-attack weekly sales.  Should sales rise, Defcon suggested, the repayment plan could be completed before its scheduled date.

42397658,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhIe,1401309646,Coinbase Launches Payment Pages to Make Bitcoin Socially Shareable,"San Francisco-based bitcoin services provider Coinbase has launched a new feature called Payment Pages that enables users to have a social, sharable payment profile.  The company is promoting the effort with the help of notable names and charitable efforts.  Nas, Marc Andreessen and Code.org are just some of the luminaries that have created Payment Pages for the official launch. The proceeds of bitcoin transactions to these accounts will go to charity.  In a post on the official Coinbase blog, the company states:  ""This personal address makes it easier than ever for people to know where to send you bitcoin.""  Making bitcoin basic  Getting on users on board with bitcoin via cryptographic addresses like ""1H3Nr8N68EaFiMggFpX2QpUp4edtZmUgui"" is difficult. This is likely a major reason Coinbase is launching Payment Pages.  The Payment Pages feature combines the ease of digital currencies with a social profile that seems to be factoring for the modern Internet Twitter and Facebook have created.  Payment Pages creates an easy-to-use URL for people. For example, the page for rapper Nas (where bitcoin donations go to Watsi.org) is https://coinbase.com/Nas:  After clicking on ""Send Money"", users are given the option to either directly send from their Coinbase wallet or use an external BTC wallet.  For the launch, Marc Andreessen's Coinbase page is donating to the social fund AV2.org. Code.org is also part of the initial Pages push, funding non-profit computer science projects.  Coinbase has committed to matching any charitable donations to these accounts, up to $50,000  Digital currency meets social media  The popularity of bitcoin has to-date primarily revolved around its price. But, the unexpected rise of dogecoin has provided evidence that the better path to cryptocurrency adoption may be social media.  Coinbase's Payment Pages, for instance, are easily shareable on places like Twitter:    I just donated Bitcoin to @watsi via @Nas! http://t.co/INZUqC0MbT      — Fred Ehrsam (@FEhrsam) May 28, 2014    QuickCoin is another example of how the bitcoin industry is looking to leverage sharing to increase bitcoin adoption. The QuickCoin wallet integrates with Facebook for BTC transactions through the gargantuan social network.  Coinbase is obviously paying attention to the viral effects social media could have on BTC. Coupled with its giveaway of digital currency to college students and concert-goers, the company is increasing its efforts to spread the word about bitcoin, especially to a younger audience.

42397642,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDh4s,1401307251,Gyft Integration Lets iOS Users Buy Gift Cards from Pheeva Bitcoin Wallet,"Bitcoin wallet provider Pheeva has integrated its hot wallet service with Gyft, a San Francisco-based mobile gift card company that accepts bitcoin. Users can access more than 200 retail gift cards from inside of its wallet, thanks to its new relationship with Gyft.  The idea is to simplify the process for people using bitcoin, and vice-versa.  Lamar Wilson, the founder of Pheeva, told CoinDesk:  ""We just took away more of [bitcoin's] friction, so you can just buy gift cards directly in the wallet.""  Gyft access  The difference between most wallets and Pheeva is users are able to access retail spending right inside the app, rather than having to transfer bitcoins to another service.  The partnership with Gyft allows for easy purchasing of stored value with BTC from a number of retailers. Those gift cards can then be used directly from Gyft's mobile app.  Wilson explained:  ""If you don’t have Gyft on your phone then you can sign up for a Gyft account as soon as you get in [the wallet].""  There are companies moving away from isolated applications and toward allowing an e-commerce ecosystem for bitcoin.  Hive, a newly released mobile app for Android, offers an app store that has this added functionality, and Coinbase Apps is an example of bringing bitcoin extensibility from that popular wallet into one centralized location.  The iOS workaround  Pheeva is able to successfully get around Apple's mobile restriction on bitcoin wallets transactions through the use of a cooperative. This is normally used for organizations that keep mobile applications private and that are focused on a smaller subset of users.  The way it works is that mobile users have to sign up for Pheeva on its website in order to join the cooperative. This is true for Pheeva on both iOS and Android. After signing up, the site then redirects to a download page, depending on mobile platform.  Here is a demonstration of the app sign-up process, as well as some shots of the Gyft functionality within Pheeva's wallet service:  Wilson told CoinDesk that getting a full iPhone bitcoin wallet experience is easier than most people realize, saying:  ""If you fill out the form on the iPhone, you can click the button and literally download the app right there.""  Of course, there are other available wallet apps for iOS, however, these options have limited transaction capability, and Apple's restrictive policy toward bitcoin wallets on its app store has led to a number of high-profile delistings.  Major players such as Coinbase and Blockchain have had full-function wallets removed from the Apple App Store. The Apple stance on bitcoin has been thought by some in the bitcoin community as a way to control all financial transactions within its mobile ecosystem.  Cooperative mentality  Wilson knows the cooperative approach does give Pheeva a unique position on iOS.  He said the network effects also give the wallet a more community-oriented vibe. ""The cooperative is actually bringing us in users,"" he added.  Pheeva has monetization plans in place for its future. At some point, the company plans to launch an ad network and, as a cooperative, proceeds will be redistributed to members.  As Wilson explained:  ""The way [it] works, revenue that comes into the company is split up into the cooperative.""  Having iOS is clearly a major advantage, given the few options for people in that market. Looking to tap into nascent demand among Apple users, Wilson said he hopes to add both Coinbase and Blockchain capabilities to the wallet through the use of those companies' APIs.  Ultimately, he believes in selling Pheeva to the masses as a 'hot' wallet. The focus is specifically for retail payments, thus the reason for the Gyft integration:  ""We’re promoting it as a hot wallet because we’d rather people just use it for small to medium transactions.""  iPhone image via Twin Design / Shutterstock",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/28/gyft-integration-lets-ios-users-buy-gift-cards-from-pheeva-bitcoin-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b8a14b67eda4eee63bcaf8929052f286e9e31b3c-1000x677.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397656,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhFh,1401301874,"Mt. Gox to Sell Bitcoin Trademark, But Could a Buyer Enforce It?","Tibanne KK, the parent company of the now-bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, is currently searching for investors to buy the company's trademark rights to the word “bitcoin”.  The company first acquired the trademark in 2011, and the rights to associated protections are not set to expire until 2021 in the EU and in 2022 in Japan.  However, the potential sale of the bitcoin trademark raises questions over the validity of the “bitcoin” trademark and whether it could be held up in court owing to the word’s general usage throughout the digital currency ecosystem.  For an expert's take, CoinDesk spoke with Daliah Saper of Saper Law, a Chicago-based attorney who specializes in intellectual property. Saper, whose firm began accepting bitcoin payments in 2013, remarked that at anyone who owns the trademark would likely have a hard time actually enforcing it internationally.  ""It's a generic term – no one can own 'shirt' for shirts or 'watch' for watch. Bitcoin is the only way that people can reference bitcoin without talking about what it is,"" Saper explained.  Tibanne is also selling its bitcoin-related domain names in a package it hopes will net at least $1m – a sum that could potentially be used to repay creditors.  An executive from Tibanne told The Wall Street Journal that, as a result of Mt. Gox’s collapse, the company simply wasn’t using the domains anymore.  Sale complications  Saper said that anyone who buys the bitcoin trademark from Mt. Gox may run into problems beyond the general nature of the word itself.  First, because Tibanne was not the originator of the term, anyone who subsequently purchases it would have to prove that the word hadn’t entered general usage prior to time the trademark was first acquired. The word first appeared in 2009 in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original white paper.  According to the UK-based Intellectual Property Office, Tibanne trademarked the word in four classes related to software, electronic commerce, and both the transmission and hosting of e-commerce services. Whoever acquires the trademark would need to use the trademark for these purposes, as well as prove the validity of the trademark on these grounds it challenges.  Otherwise, the trademark would likely be considered abandoned and others could seek to trademark the word in a new application filing.  Unlikely approval  Saper suggested that Tibanne was granted the bitcoin trademark because at the time, the digital currency was not well known among government officials and regulators. As a result, it’s possible that the company acquired the trademark simply because whoever approved it didn’t know that bitcoin was a generic term, she said, explaining:  ""It may be that the trademark examiner looking at this application wasn’t really sure what it was, and just gave it to them.""  Saper added that had the trademark application been filed a year or two later, it’s highly unlikely it would be given the same approval.

Released today, the extensive slideshow features a graph showcasing the rapid expansion evident in the bitcoin wallet space.  With this information, Meeker concludes that the uptick in bitcoin wallet ownership is proof of ""extraordinary interest"" in cryptocurrencies.  Meeker noted that the number of bitcoin wallets has increased eight-fold since last year, and that more than 5 million bitcoin wallets are currently in use today from major providers such as Blockchain, Multibit and Coinbase.  The slide was part of a short series on the ""Re-Imagining of Money"", which also alluded to Square Cash, the latest mobile wallet play by mobile point-of-sale giant Square.

As such, her positive inclusion of bitcoin could prove influential in drawing more interest and intellect toward the digital currency ecosystem.  Meeker has been praised by publications such as Fortune for her ability to spot big-picture trends, as she championed Google stock as a prime investment opportunity.

42397662,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhLb,1401293590,Video: London’s Pembury Tavern Celebrates a Year of Bitcoin,"Buying something with bitcoin in London is no longer a novelty.  You can buy your groceries, a trendy bicycle, a bottle of gin, and even tickets for a play in the capital. There are so many bars and pubs accepting bitcoin that you can even go on a pub crawl across town. Yes, the CoinDesk team has attempted this.  However, the first of the many pubs in London that started accepting bitcoin was The Pembury Tavern. Located in East London’s borough of Hackney, the outfit opened it doors to bitcoiners last summer.  We headed over to The Pembury Tavern to celebrate their one year anniversary and chat with founder Stephen Early to find out how bitcoin payments have panned out for him one year on.  [youtube id=""9Fa_72t4W70"" width=""620"" height=""360""]  .  Early says that deciding to accept bitcoin was his “best ever accidental publicity campaign”.  “I originally decided to experiment with it just because I was interested in the technology.”  He claims he just ""mentioned"" online that he was starting to take bitcoin and received enormous media interest. Early says that he sees about £1,000 of bitcoin transactions per month, but due to the recent drop in the price, that number has gone down.  “With the drop in price of bitcoin recently, people are more reluctant to spend it.”  As one of the first merchants in London to start accepting bitcoin, he also has some feedback for bitcoin wallet providers.  “My biggest criticism so far is some of the wallets are very bad at actually emitting unconfirmed bitcoin transactions into the bitcoin peer-to-peer network. What happens in that case is the customer’s wallet tells them they’ve paid, our till hasn’t received the payment because the transaction hasn't been broadcast over the network and then we are stuck!”  However, he has no plans of reversing his bitcoin acceptance.

42397664,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhMa,1401289272,Facebook's Ben Davenport Leaves for Bitcoin Startup BitGo,"Software engineer and bitcoin angel investor Ben Davenport is departing from a three-year stint at Facebook to join BitGo – a company that helps users and organizations better secure their bitcoin funds.  Davenport, who has early-stage invested in at least seven bitcoin startups since 2011, will join as head of product and co-founder, he told CoinDesk, adding:  “The way I think about Bitgo is it’s a pioneering leader in security for bitcoin.”  BitGo and multisig  Davenport pointed out that BitGo was one of the first companies to release a multi-signature (or 'multisig') bitcoin wallet – a more secure way of storing bitcoins.  Most wallets in use today rely on one public and one private key – the latter being all that is required to release funds. Loss of that key means the funds will no longer be accessible, and theft of the key may result in the funds being stolen.  Multisig, however, uses several private keys, more than one of which (for example, two of three) must be signed before funds will be sent. Redundancy is also provided, so, if one of the keys is lost or compromised, the funds can still be controlled, providing the other keys are still held.  For its consumer wallet, BitGo currently uses three keys: one for the user, one for BitGo and one stored in offline backup. At least two of the three keys are needed to access the wallet.  Since two keys must be signed to access the wallet, there can be no single source of intrusion, meaning a hacker would somehow need to obtain more than one key to gain control of the funds.  However, the company plans to concentrate on providing more complex schemes for organizations through its enterprise product. To that end, BitGo is building an advanced set of tools to be used as the bitcoin variation of traditional corporate accounting software.  ""This is really bringing the same type of [multisig] technology to companies that want to hold and transact bitcoin,"" said Davenport.  Complex systems  Larger organizations are by nature complex systems. Companies have different levels of management from the CEO downward, and then there is the accounting department that is tasked with moving money around.  ""All those people need to transact with bitcoin, but need to be able to have business roles in place,"" explained Davenport. ""Spending limits, velocity limits and approval chains.""  That's where BitGo sees an opening: providing organisations with the ability to better control bitcoin process and procedure in the form of multiple private key signatures. This, along with its cold storage product, will offer enhanced security for enterprises.  Multisig also provides granularity in the form of access clearances for bitcoin transactions, said Davenport, adding:  ""That sort of thing doesn’t exist for bitcoin today and that’s one of the things that BitGo will be enabling.""  BitGo won't just be targeting traditional companies with its products either, said Davenport, adding that the company will be ""empowering other bitcoin businesses – from exchanges to mining pools and even other wallets.""  Growth of multisig  Multisig is expected to become the standard for bitcoin wallets over the next few years, since one key simply does not provide enough security.

42397648,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDh9n,1401286045,Who Will Protect Investors in a Cryptocurrency Crowdsale?,"Cryptocurrency is moving from crowdfunding new startups to ‘crowdselling’ them, and several new ventures are promising to decentralize the whole process.  At least three new projects have surfaced this month, all of which want to put crowdsale ventures on the block chain. However, one of the biggest questions remains unanswered: how will gullible and inexperienced investors be protected from making bad decisions?  The idea of raising money for new projects using bitcoin began with crowdfunding – Kickstarter-style sites allowing projects to take bitcoins in payment. Success has been limited, however.  Others have experienced far more success by ‘crowdselling’ instead, in which they sell equity to large numbers of people, rather than simply taking pre-orders or donations from them.  Seedcoin  , for example, works via Havelock Investments, which has been owned since last November by The Panama Fund. Havelock is a Panamanian registered bitcoin investment fund, dealing with only offshore investments.  The company retains a proportion of shares in the companies that work with it, and aggregates them into a fund. It then sells investors shares in that fund, meaning that they invest in more than one company at a time.  In that sense it follows a centralized model: administering funds from a single point. But, as with all things crypto, several parties are now moving to decentralize the whole thing via the block chain.  From crowdfunding to crowdsale  Adam Levine, a well-known bitcoin entrepreneur who is also involved in Humint, is the person behind one of these crowdsale projects, called CoinPowers. He points out that the by-now traditional Kickstarter crowdfunding model is flawed, because it doesn’t offer equity:  “The way things are now, if you don't want the reward there is very little reason to support such a project even if it's a good idea and you think it can succeed. Sure you can just donate, but in practice most people view their donation and its reward as a pre-order.”  One problem with that is that users don’t get to leave. Once they’ve made a donation, they’re stuck – even if the company changes direction, or sells itself to a large player. That’s what happened with Oculous Rift, the Kickstarter-funded virtual-reality goggles firm which sold to Facebook, infuriating users.  Companies are hoping that trading shares or assurance contracts in new startups using the block chain will cut through that whole tangled mess, while giving them more of a stake in the firm. Hence, the move from the crowdfunding to the crowdsale model. And there are a few firms already doing it.  BitShares  is another venture that offers people the chance to trade shares in companies online. It may have morphed since we wrote about it last August, following the departure of cofounder Charles Hoskinson to form Ethereum.  And Counterparty, a distributed exchange offering people the chance to issue their own assets, is another potential platform for crowdsales.  We’ve already seen MaidSafe, the distributed, anonymous storage network, which sold its own coin via the Mastercoin altcoin to help fund itself, and made $6m in its first five hours. Now, there are other, slightly different models, all wanting to use the block chain to decentralize the sale of equity to large numbers of users.  Earlier in May, Mike Hearn launched a new project, Lighthouse, which he has described as a crowdfunding application, which uses assurance contracts. It isn’t designed to sell shares in a company, though – it’s designed to raise money for the initial development phase of a project, just to get a project off the ground.  Because it’s block chain based, you can revoke pledges to a project if it doesn't deliver, Hearn said, explaining:  “It’s usable for small, lightweight micro-crowdfunds, like someone who is organizing a small party or conference where people buy tickets by pledging. The organization only goes ahead once enough tickets are pre-sold and people only pay for their tickets if enough people will go for it to be fun. Existing crowdfunding sites have overheads that are too high for this.”  Then, there’s Levine’s CoinPowers project. He’s not revealing too much, other than to call it a “solution-agnostic donation and crowdsale platform”. It will enable people to build their own tokens that will be used to raise value for a project, and a platform to launch it on.  “We're primarily focused on distributed applications and project-based coins rather than so called ‘virtual IPOs’,” Levine adds.  Another project that will use tokens to represent assets is Swarm, created by software developer and entrepreneur Joel Dietz.  This platform would have crowdsale projects issue their own coins for sale to participants. If the project succeeded, participants would then receive profits based on the coins that they held. The venture is offering its own crowdsale, where participants can receive a share of coins launched by others on the platform.  “This is similar to an AngelList syndicate or eToro or other socially enabled platforms, where you can ‘follow’ a particular person or idea,” he says, adding:  “The exciting part is that we are building this in a decentralized way, where multiple parties can endorse a project and a retail investor can make their decision based on the success of previous investors.”  Regulatory issues  While all this is going on, regulators are still grappling with the concept of centralized crowdsales. In 2012, the US passed the JOBS Act, which included a provision that allowed non-accredited investors to invest in companies.  However, Congress passed the details off to the SEC, which last year finally released proposed rules for the solicitation part of the law, which governs crowdfunding. Those rules have not yet been passed.  “Crowdfunding has taken three steps in the right direction, but is hitting a regulatory wall. We, and a million others like us, are either going to climb over or walk around or blast through this wall. We aren't going to wait,” says Dietz.  The question is, will regulators let it? Crowdfunding site BitFunder was shut down by last October, after pressure from the SEC, indicating that regulators are taking notice. It was the latest in a line of dead bitcoin ‘stock exchanges’.  [post-quote]  The SEC plays a role in protecting investors from securities that may be very risky, or even fraudulent. Companies that sell shares in themselves via an Initial Public Offering (IPO) regulated by the SEC must undergo an incredible amount of hoop jumping before they can get there. Even then, they’re sometimes found to be actively defrauding the markets.  In angel and venture capital funding, the investments aren’t publicly available, but are instead restricted to experienced people who want to participate.  Crowdsales on the block chain are effectively funding rounds, because they allow investors to buy assets related to new ventures.  Those ventures are selling the assets to raise money for their own development. But they don’t have the same level of scrutiny as an SEC IPO, and yet they’re open to everyone, rather than just accredited investors.  Protecting the retail investor  So what is being done to protect these retail investors?  “Nothing, and some people will probably get rapped by the SEC for it,” says Lighthouse’s Hearn.  Others hope to offer some protection by vetting their projects. Dietz plans to conduct his own due diligence on potential fundees, by having them fill out a form. But where is the auditing process?  Havelock tries to offer some protection in the form of a prospectus.  “It can’t guarantee your investment, but at least it can check to ensure that the guy is who he says he is,” said a source close to the company, who added that it issues a prospectus for funds that it launches.  The fund is liquid, meaning that it’s freely traded under an exchange, said the source, and that users’ money isn’t stuck there. He also argues that investments are usually small:  “The amazing thing is that you can have thousands of people putting in five dollars each.”  CaVirtex, a successful Canadian exchange, started off at Havelock Investments.  “If you want a poster child from something that started as an idea,"" said the source, ""and then later on were able to reach physical shares, that’s your poster child for a successful company that was able to raise capital in 12 hours.”  CaVirtex, which launched on the exchange in March 2013, had the advantage of being able to ride on bitcoin’s incredible success. Other Havelock-listed companies – and their investors – were not so lucky. Neo & Bee, for example, was a Havelock-listed company that collapsed.  “There are worse players before and there will be worse after. It’s a risk-to-reward ratio. [Havelock] didn’t specifically launch this company, it was a passthrough fund, which it doesn’t do anymore,” the source said.  Eddy Travia, the co-founder of Seedcoin, which lists its funds on Havelock Investments, argues that the accountability lies with the investor.  “I would advise them to gauge the public interest in this project, the relevance of this project for the community, the seriousness of the project leaders, the solidity of the fundraising process itself,” he says, giving the MaidSafe project as an example.  “I know the Mastercoin team and I trust they are doing a very serious and professional work in putting together the crowdsale process. Of course, as an investor I would also need to look into the project itself and see if this is something I feel represents an attractive value proposition for my own objectives.”  Ideally, Levine hopes that a lot of this will be solved by reputation systems:  “No matter the form, fraud is illegal. Beyond that, most of the projects I'm consulting on are reputationally binding rather than legally binding. If you start a project, create a token and use that as the fuel to build your project and then when it's ready you do not follow through and honor the token, you've disenfranchised your earliest and probably most passionate supporters. Those people who were and would have been your evangelists are now very burned by you and incentivized to share their experience, which will make it more difficult for you to operate.""  That’s all very well, but in a truly decentralized system, anyone could create a project on the block chain, and it wouldn’t have to be vetted. And leaving accountability entirely in the hands of the investor has always been fraught with danger, because as we know from traditional financial markets, it’s usually pretty easy to separate a fool from his money.  No one has yet been able to answer the question of how we’ll protect non-accredited retail investors in the age of the block chain-based crowdsale – and if it takes off, that, rather than any technological issues, may prove to be its biggest challenge.

42397653,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhGg,1401280116,BitPay Now Processing $1 Million in Bitcoin Payments Every Day,"Bitcoin payments processor BitPay has revealed it is now processing an average of $1m worth of bitcoin payments per day.  Coinbase and BitPay are currently the biggest bitcoin processors on the market and BitPay says it is serving the needs of over 30,000 businesses and organisations.  The company’s client list features a number of big names, including: Zynga, Virgin Galactic, WordPress, Gyft, Shopify and TigerDirect.  Bitcoin adoption made easy  The basic idea behind bitcoin payments processors is simple – they allow merchants to accept bitcoin without having to handle bitcoins at all, as all transactions are converted to fiat. This approach also means merchants are not exposed to a number of risks associated with bitcoin, namely volatility and wallet security.  A large number of merchants clearly like the idea, as the company went from 10,000 merchants last year to more than 30,000 in just nine months.  BitPay processed an estimated $110m worth of bitcoin transactions last year and at this rate it stands to process three times as much this year. NewsBTC reports that the company hopes bring as many as 100,000 merchants in its fold by the end of the year.  Record funding round and expansion  Earlier this month the company successfully closed a $30m Series A funding round, setting a record for bitcoin company funding. The round was led by Index Ventures and several prominent investors decided to pitch in, including Sir Richard Branson, PayPal founder Peter Thiel and AME Cloud Ventures, helmed by Yahoo founder Jerry Yang.  Even before the record-breaking funding round was announced, the Atlanta-based company started an aggressive expansion, opening offices in Amsterdam, Buenos Aires and San Francisco.  A leadership reshuffle was also revealed recently. Stephen Pair has moved up to the position of CEO, while former CEO Tony Gallippi has now taken the role of Executive Chairman. BitPay said the decision would create openings for additional executive-level positions and ensure that developers are well represented in the leadership team.

42397660,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbDhKc,1401275587,Wedbush Analysts: VC Funding in Bitcoin Doubled in Under Three Months,"Wedbush Securities has issued a new report on bitcoin, concluding that its recent boost in VC funding could unleash its disruptive potential in the long run.  The report, titled ‘Timing and Sizing the Era of Bitcoin’, examines emerging opportunities for bitcoin and its potential effects on various industries. Wedbush analysts Gil Luria and Aaron Turner believe bitcoin could have a profound effect on trust-based markets, payments markets and a range of other industries, including the Internet of Things (IoT).  The analysts think the disruption from bitcoin will take longer than expected, but it will have an even more profound effect than anticipated. The “era of bitcoin” is expected to last between two and 20 years from now.  Banking, payments and more  Wedbush points out that as much as 20% of the US GDP is generated by industries whose main function is as a trusted third party. Bank fees generate $250bn a year, while revenues related to global payments exceed $300bn.  However, Wedbush expects bitcoin will have an effect beyond payments:  “Although payment transaction fees are the most obvious fees that could be reduced by using bitcoin technology, we believe the use of the blockchain asset ledger and bitcoin protocol could also challenge financial services fees such as deposit fees, foreign exchange fees, escrow, trust management fees, collections fees, etc.”  Wedbush sees a silver lining in the collapse of Mt. Gox and security challenges faced by bitcoin operators and users.  “We believe that the fact that much of bitcoin balances need to be held offline in cold storage as ironic considering the goals of digitizing transactions, and believe that improvements in security measures will eventually eliminate the need for this mechanism,” Wedbush concludes.  Another vital piece of the puzzle will be the introduction of secure, robust and regulated exchanges in the US over the next few months. The key driver of the bitcoin price will future transaction volumes rather than regulatory moves and trading anomalies such as the Mt. Gox collapse.  Wedbush also pointed out that the volume of VC funding has more than doubled in less than three months. It also commented on emerging technologies such as Ethereum, which could enable further developments in the field of digital currencies and smart contracts.  Disrupt everything  In addition to the financial services industry, Wedbush believes bitcoin could eventually disrupt a number of unrelated industries, including some emerging ones. Luria and Turner argue that bitcoin adoption is going through the “adoption chasm” and boarder adoption is still one to three years away.  One industry stands out as a potentially huge market with a role for bitcoin technology, if not bitcoin itself. Machine-to-machine communication, i.e. the Internet of Things, requires mechanisms to secure internet communication, allowing IoT devices to interact and transact. The Internet of Things is forecast to generate global revenues of up to $8.9tn by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 7.9%.  The company views bitcoin and Ethereum as “enabling technologies” that could be used to reduce denial of service (DDoS) attacks and eliminate spam emails.  Wedbush discussed a number of other uses for bitcoin and blockchain technology in a similar report published in January.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/05/28/wedbush-analysts-vc-funding-in-bitcoin-doubled-in-under-three-months,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8074594fd3ac2bfb9765f00310ed36bc90719444-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425718,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIfUth,1401269619,Why Bitcoin's Price Has Leapt 64% Since April,"Bitcoin’s price has been on a roll of late.  The CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) recently crossed back above $590 on the 27th of May, representing a 64% gain from 10th April when the price was as low as $360.  Much of this dramatic price increase has come in just the last few days. For approximately a one-month period prior to 19th May, bitcoin was trading in a relatively tight band around the $450 level. Then, on that date, the price began to steadily ratchet upwards (see Figure 1).    Figure 1: CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, 25th April – 26th May 2014    Shifting momentum  The price of bitcoin may have also crossed an important technical threshold.  Bitcoin has reversed trading below its 50-day moving price average for the first time since early February (Figure 2).  Investors will often look to breaks above and below various moving average calculations as an important directional signal about where prices may be headed.    Figure 2: Bitcoin 50-day moving average and daily price, Jan – May 2014    The clear break above the 50-day moving average is perhaps a bullish technical indicator of where bitcoin’s price may be trading in the near-term.  Volume trends  The recent price increase has been accompanied by a significant increase in USD trading volume as can be seen in Figure 3.    Figure 3: Bitcoin USD Price and Trading Volume, Feb – May 2014    From the 1st-18th May, there were approximately 16,000 USD-denominated bitcoins traded on average each day on exchanges. From the 19th-26th May, that figure more than doubled to over 41,000 bitcoins traded on average per day.[1]  Recent USD volumes, however, have not reached the levels of late March to early April when news began spreading of a further crackdown by Chinese authorities on the ability of bitcoin exchanges to interface with Chinese banks.  Why is bitcoin’s price rising?  Unlike other significant price moves in the past there is no obvious event which can be pinpointed to account for the recent price increase.  A rise in the number of bitcoin transactions, which would perhaps indicate greater commercial use and demand for bitcoin, could explain a bitcoin price increase.  However, the use of bitcoin as measured by total bitcoin transactions has remained relatively steady (Figure 4).    Figure 4: Daily bitcoin transactions, 26 April – 26 May 2014        .  Rather a combination of events may explain recent price trends.  China stabilizes, eBay teases, BitPay raises  In spite of the further crackdown by Chinese authorities, the bitcoin exchanges which are located in China have continued trading and not been forced to relocate operations as was previously feared.  In fact, the evidence from recent trading volumes at CoinDesk CNY Bitcoin Price Index component exchange BTC China suggests trading volume may be picking up in China once again (Figure 5).    Figure 5: BTC China trading volume (units), Mar – May 2014    Other possible explanations for the rise in the price of bitcoin include mention by eBay CEO that the online marketplace is ""actively considering"" integrating bitcoin into its payment system.  As discussed in the CoinDesk State of Bitcoin report, a move by a major retailer such as eBay to adopt bitcoin could be a major catalyst for further use and demand for bitcoin, which in turn should drive the price higher.  Also of note was the recent record-setting $30m venture round by bitcoin payment processor BitPay.  The investment round surpassed the previous largest bitcoin investment round of $25m for Coinbase and valued BitPay at a reported $160m. The round was a vote of confidence from venture capitalists who continue to like what they see in the bitcoin economy’s growth prospects.  What other reasons explain the recent price increase? Share your thoughts in the comments below.  [1]  Actual bitcoin USD-denominated volume is likely underrepresented by these figures from BitcoinAverage as they do not include all USD exchanges.

Taking a cue from the recent successful (at least in the attention-getting stakes) covering of NASCAR racer Josh Wise's car with dogecoin livery, Diamond Circle will put its logo alongside the orange 'B' on Johnson's helmet as he rides in the 107 year-old race classic, which is broadcast around the world.  CEO Stephen Rowlison believes that such associations and global sponsorship deals are the best way to bring light to the digital currency revolution as it rolls out its products, and thanked associates such as Jason Kelly of the Manx Digital Currency Association.  He presented one of Diamond Circle's bitcoin debit cards to Johnson's racing team Lloyd James PR Kawasaki as part of the promotion.  Bitcoin friendly jurisdiction  The Isle of Man has made bitcoin headlines outside of motorcycle racing too. A recent ruling by the island's Financial Supervision Commission determined that licenses are not required for bitcoin exchanges, and over 15 bitcoin exchanges are said to be interested in setting up there.  Fast internet and low taxes have already made the territory an e-commerce hub, including a large number of online gambling sites.  Business leaders on the self-governing British Crown dependency have formed the Manx Digital Currency Association, whose role is to assist government and protect the reputation of the Isle of Man through sensible policies.  Diamond Circle's ecosystem  Diamond Circle is developing a bitcoin payments infrastructure consisting of ATMs, debit cards, merchant POS systems and online exchanges, with plan to use near-field communication (NFC) technology to send and receive coins.  Selling its system both locally and internationally, Diamond Circle says overseas interest had been strong, and it recently sold six of its 'cashless' ATM terminals to a customer in the Middle East.
