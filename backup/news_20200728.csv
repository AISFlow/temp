42384221,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1JMj,1595968544,Market Wrap: Bitcoin's Price and Ether's Dominance Sit at 2020 Highs,"Bitcoin's price is at its 11-month high as volatility bounces back up. Meanwhile, ether's dominance has spiked on continued growth in decentralized finance (DeFi).    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $10,998 as of 20:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 2.1% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $10,573-$11,422  BTC above 10-day and 50-day moving averages, a bullish signal for market technicians.    The price of bitcoin hit another 2020 high Tuesday, reaching $11,422 on spot exchanges like Coinbase. The last time the price of the world’s oldest cryptocurrency hit that level on Coinbase was Aug. 12, 2019.      Read More: Bitcoin Futures Volume Surges 186% as Price Hits $11K      “Bitcoin has pushed decisively through not only psychological resistance of $10,000 but also a key level near $10,055,” said Katie Stockton, an analyst at Fairlead Strategies. However, she is skeptical the price can stay over $11,000.      “There are some signs of upside exhaustion on this push higher, so we would be sure to await confirmation of the breakout before adding exposure to bitcoin. This would occur on consecutive weekly closes above $10,055,” she added.      “The Fear and Greed Index is in the ‘extreme greed’ zone, moving towards the overbought level,” noted Konstatine Kogan of cryptocurrency fund of funds BitBull Capital. “The first support is located at the level of $10,000. If bitcoin falls below this mark, then there is a possibility of a subsequent decline,” he added.      Not all stakeholders are suspicious of the bitcoin market’s price run-up. One positive for traders is that volatility is making a comeback, according to data from aggregator CryptoCompare.      “Historical bitcoin volatility has bounced from its lowest point since March 2019,” said James Li, research analyst for CryptoCompare. “The question is whether this is just a temporary bounce or are we heading back to a historical, more volatile BTC market,” he added.

Read More: Soaring DeFi Usage Drives Ethereum Contract Calls to New Record      The dominance of ether in the cryptocurrency market crossed 12% Monday, its highest point in 2020, according to data calculated by real-time charting firm TradingView. Dominance, or the market cap as a percentage of the entire cryptosphere, is a measure traders use to quickly get a sense of a cryptocurrency’s importance relative to the broader digital currency market. Although ether’s dominance has dipped below 12% Tuesday, it’s still higher than it has been all year; the last time ether hit 12% dominance was back in May 2019.      “DeFi users can access that market using stablecoins. But clearly the main core asset fueling the DeFi run is still ether, hence its recent dominance,” said Jean-Marc Bonnefous, managing partner for Tellurian Capital, which has been investing in crypto projects since 2014.“The recent development and ramping up of new and better DeFi applications such as Compound, Aave and Balancer is clearly generating more traction for Ethereum,” he added.

42384207,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1J1L,1595964608,Community Behind Privacy-Focused Smart Contract Forges Ahead After Settlement,"The community behind “secret contracts” is moving forward after months of delay.      The Secret Network, an open source network that protects data for users of decentralized applications, known as “Secret Apps,” has started a token burn and is welcoming players such as Binance, Staked and Figment to its testnet of “secret contracts.”      The network’s protocol lets decentralized applications use encrypted data without revealing it on a public blockchain, or even to nodes themselves, using smart contracts that use private data termed “secret contracts.”      This is one of the main selling points of the Secret Network, a decentralized community that includes contributors such as Enigma, Secretnodes.org, and Chain of Secrets.      The developments are important for a network that was stymied after Enigma, which developed secret contracts, settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February over its $45 million 2017 initial coin offering.  That left the Enigma mainnet project in limbo. But over the last few months, community stakeholders have independently progressed the vision of the project, organizing a token swap where owners of now defunct ENG tokens, sold during Enigma’s ICO, can swap them for Secret (SCRT) tokens.    The token swap    Since the token swap went live June 27, more than 9 million tokens have been exchanged, with a value of over $2.4 million.      “Privacy is really the thing that drew me in,” said Ian Dixon, one of the key community members that set up the token swap, who is based in Sparks, Nevada. “I love bitcoin but what's at the core of bitcoin? It’s privacy. And Enigma’s idea definitely spoke to me because even after all the ways that bitcoin might change, the core thing that doesn’t is privacy, and Enigma stuck with that in a way no one else has.”      Enigma's settlement with the SEC left the company unable to comment on or coordinate much of anything in the community. Dixon and other contributors were left wondering what would happen next and decided to step in. They agreed to a swap of tokens, working on it in addition to their full time jobs until it went live in late June.      See also: This New Coding Language Could Help Unlock Bitcoin’s Smart Contract Potential      The Secret Network uses a computing technique known as Trusted Execution Environments (TEE), which allows computers to analyze data without exposing it to other parts of the system, somewhat like a vault. The secret contract code is finalized, but has yet to be proposed to the mainnet. There are currently 34 active validators on the network.      “Enigma is continuing to collaborate with the community in the development of Secret Network, including the recent completion of the code to enable secret contracts on the network,” said Guy Zyskind, CEO and cofounder, Enigma.    Secret contracts in action    That day is coming closer, as the Secret Network launched an incentivized testnet for its secret contracts that includes 15 validators including Binance, one of the largest exchanges in the world, Staked and Figment, which are two of the crypto world’s biggest staking providers, as well as Chorus One, which builds core infrastructure for blockchain protocols. The development is the final step before the secret contracts are proposed to the mainnet, and represent what could be adopted by some of the largest players in crypto.      Since the settlement, Enigma has focused on the development of privacy preserving tech, such as the secret contracts. It’s also using IBM Cloud to build the Enigma Confidential Computing Platform, and bringing that platform to bear on data sharing in the time of COVID-19 through SafeTrace, a contact tracing function that would allow data such as location history and diagnosis results in a privacy-preserving manner between users and data providers, according to Enigma.      The Secret Network’s community of validators and developers have proposed the idea of creating a foundation to oversee, coordinate, and amplify the work of the network. The idea resulted in the launch of the Secret Foundation on June 15, with Tor Bair, former Head of Growth at Enigma, as the foundation’s Executive Director and Chairman.      See also: EU Privacy Shield Ruling Is an Opportunity and Conundrum for Decentralized Tech      Laura Weindorf, who is based in Grand Rapids, Mich., was another person who was attracted to the Secret Network for its emphasis on privacy.      “Things are going to happen with it that we wouldn't even have thought of, as everything evolves,” said Weindorf. “That's very exciting to me and I really wanted to be part of that in general.”      She worked on the network upgrade that changed web addresses for the Secret Network, so they started with the word “secret” and added the token swap module that several people developers built to the mainnet.      “I saw that enterprises were exploring private blockchains, and sure, you can do that. But for mass adoption you need to have scalability and privacy built in, and so I got involved,” said Weindorf.      See also: ‘Radical Indifference’: How Surveillance Capitalism Conquered Our Lives      Dixon is looking forward to furthering his work on a block explorer, Puzzle, after months of work on the token swap.      “We're going to be adding off chain voting and the idea is, we want users to be able to signal their interest in different initiatives and ideas on these Cosmos based networks, starting with the Secret Network, and it’s going to be private voting” said Dixon.      The next step for secret contracts are quickly approaching.      “The second phase of Secret Network’s incentivized testnet will begin in early August, with secret contracts expected to be proposed on mainnet in September,” said Tor Bair, Executive Director of the Secret Foundation. “This would make Secret Network the first public blockchain to support smart contracts that use encrypted inputs, outputs and state.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | BNB | TOKEN SALE,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/28/community-behind-privacy-focused-smart-contract-forges-ahead-after-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7c74febfc578d0c708b14225dda121f80de7c86c-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42389371,4pHPaGKu7LL5ERBnY3J6uN,1595963107,What Crypto Lender Celsius Isn’t Telling Its Depositors,"Standing in a spacious, white living room and sporting a black T-shirt, Alex Mashinsky, CEO and co-founder of cryptocurrency lender Celsius Network, urged his customers to ignore the naysayers.  “Don’t listen to the FUD-ers, look at the facts,” Mashinsky said on the YouTube livestream on July 17, using crypto slang for “fear, uncertainty and doubt.” A few minutes later, he reassured the audience of “Celsians,” as the platform’s users are nicknamed, that the company is prudently deploying their crypto deposits.  Like a bank, Celsius Network borrows from one set of clients, lends to other customers and pockets the difference in interest. Unlike a bank, it only borrows and mainly lends cryptocurrency, and it does not have government deposit insurance. The company claims to have gathered a total of more than $1 billion worth of crypto deposits as of June.  As an example of its high lending standards, Mashinsky said Celsius Network strictly demands collateral when making a loan.  “When you’re using any other platforms that are like Celsius, what you care about is, who is the borrower?” Mashinksy said. “Is the lender doing non-collateralized loans? Celsius does not do non-collateralized loans. … Celsius will not do that because that would be taking too much risk on your behalf.”  The statement was at odds with what Celsius’ own representative had told CoinDesk just a few days before.  In response to a question from CoinDesk, Anastasia Golovina, an external spokesperson for Celsius Network at the Ditto PR agency, confirmed the company also makes uncollateralized loans, on what she described as a limited basis.  “Celsius’ total uncollateralized loans are less than a fraction of 1 percent out of tens of thousands of loans issued since 2018,” Golovina told CoinDesk by email on July 13, referring to the number of loans but not the dollar volume. “All of these were normal size loans and were done to institutions with billions of dollars in equity.”  When subsequently asked about the dollar volume of the uncollateralized loans and about Mashinsky's denial of their existence on the AMA, Golovina did not provide a response.  Read more: Crypto Lending 101  Even if small, the uncollateralized lending is one of several salient items that Celsius has downplayed or not shared with depositors.  Is Celsius Network the next hot ticket?  Celsius, which has raised close to $20 million in the past two months on the crowdfunding platform BnkTotheFuture (including $10 million from stablecoin issuer Tether), is a major player in a budding corner of the crypto industry.  In the past year, lending activity has mushroomed as some holders sought to earn a yield on their assets, others sought to raise cash without selling their coins and market makers borrowed to fill orders quickly.  The phenomenon could potentially improve liquidity and price discovery for crypto assets. (Disclosure: Another crypto lender, Genesis Capital, is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent company of CoinDesk.)  But like all lending, the crypto kind carries risk – and Celsius may be taking more of it than depositors fully realize.  Whatever the amount of unsecured lending in which Celsius engages, the majority of Celsius’ loans appears to be collateralized. To borrow $1,000 with a 0.7% interest rate, for example, a trader needs to pledge around 0.43 BTC of collateral to Celsius as of this writing, and if the value of that collateral dips, the loan is subject to margin calls.  But Celsius has also at times invested deposits in perpetual swaps, futures-like contracts with no expiry date, people familiar with Celsius’ business said.  Reportedly pioneered by the BitMEX exchange, perpetual swaps settle to an index periodically, letting traders maintain their positions without rolling them over. This activity, one source said, increases Celsius’ vulnerability to brutal sell-offs like the one bitcoin endured in mid-March, which led to a spike in forced unwindings of such contracts at BitMex.  “The problem is that some of that is done on BitMEX, and you take March 12 again and BitMEX closes down through the margin-call floor – the extra 2% profit is now negative 10% profit,” this person said, describing a hypothetical scenario.  Read more: Genesis CEO Details ‘Black Thursday’ Chaos in Q1 Lending Report  Celsius denied investing in perpetual swaps.  “Our business is to lend out coins to institutions,” Mashinsky said in an email to CoinDesk. “Celsius lends mostly to large institutions and sometimes to exchanges, both provide us with collateral.”  Rehypothecation: a growing concern for depositors  A serial entrepreneur who helped pioneer voice-over-internet-protocol (VOIP) technology, Mashinsky founded Celsius in early 2018. Like many in the crypto space, he touts his service as a way to democratize finance. An August 2019 pitch deck obtained by CoinDesk says the company’s vision is to provide “fair interest income for 7 billion people.”  Also potentially concerning to depositors, people with knowledge of the matter said, is that Celsius lends out portions of the collateral borrowers hand over.  An over-the-counter desk trader likened this practice, known as rehypothecation, to the way subprime loans were repackaged and sold as mortgage-backed securities and then resold as collateralized debt obligations in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.  Because of rehypothecation, which the trader said several crypto lending platforms are engaging in, he is seeing many clients pull out of lending and move toward options contracts.  Another source familiar with Celsius’ business said the lender’s rehypothecation of loan collateral is also why crypto miners don’t take out loans from the firm – they don’t want to end up unable to access crypto they mined.  In response to questions about rehypothecation of collateral, Golovina said Celsius won’t “discuss our best business practice and the competitive advantage of our business model.”  Read more:$25 Million in 2 Weeks: BlockFi Booms as Bitcoin and Ether Investors Seek Interest  In its terms of use, Celsius reserves the right to re-hypothecate customers’ assets, but it’s ambiguous whether the passage refers solely to depositors’ funds or to borrowers’ pledged collateral as well. “In consideration for the rewards earned on your Account and the use of our Services,” the document says, “you grant Celsius the right … to pledge, re-pledge, hypothecate, rehypothecate, sell, lend or otherwise transfer or use any amount of such Digital Assets … for any period of time.”  Shrunken capital  Before the aforementioned recent $19.2 million investment from Tether and BnkToTheFuture, Celsius raised its startup capital through an initial coin offering (ICO) in early 2018. The company swapped its CEL token for bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the largest and second-largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, respectively.  However, Celsius did not convert the crypto it received in the ICO to fiat until after the market tanked, which caused it to lose about half the value of the proceeds, people familiar with the sale said.  Public information supports this claim. In September 2019, Mashinsky told CoinDesk the ICO was valued at $50 million. But financial statements filed with the U.K. registrar Companies House in May 2020 show proceeds of only $25 million as of Feb. 28, 2019. (Celsius is based in Hoboken, N.J., and privately held, but has a subsidiary in London, and is thus required to file financials with the registrar.)  Celsius chalked up the difference to an accounting practice, but acknowledged it did not convert the crypto to fiat in the same month that it was raised.  “While Celsius reported an ICO worth $50 million, when the coins converted to fiat the value of the coins dropped as the market dropped in accordance,” Golovina said. “In addition, for tax reasons, we recognize revenues over several years as we use the funds to build the product.”  Read more: Here’s Why Interest Rates on Cryptocurrencies Could Be a Game-Changer  Celsius recognizes ICO proceeds as revenue only when it converts the funds to dollars, she said, again citing tax reasons.  It waited to convert the crypto to dollars because the firm identifies as a “HODLer,” she added, using crypto argot for a long-term investor.  CORRECTION (July 29, 20:20 UTC): An earlier version of this article overstated Celsius’ recent funding round. It was $19.2 million crowdfunded on BnkToTheFuture including, not in addition to, $10 million from Tether.

42384222,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1JKD,1595959995,"Bitcoin’s Latest Rally May Have Staying Power, Exchange Flows Suggest","Bitcoin is currently trading above $10,000, but is the latest move into five figures here to stay? Data suggests this rally might have legs.      The leading cryptocurrency has failed a number of times during the last 12 months to keep gains above the $10,000 mark. But this time may be different. Consider the flow of bitcoins and stablecoins in and out of cryptocurrency exchanges observed on Monday, suggesting the latest price breakout may persist.      The inflow of bitcoins into exchanges increased by 68,970 BTC to 130,039 BTC on Monday – the largest single-day rise in 134 days – as the cryptocurrency jumped over 10% to $11,315 to reach its highest level in nearly 12 months, according to Chainalysis, a blockchain intelligence firm.      In other words, as the cryptocurrency rallied to multi-month highs, some investors moved their coins to exchanges. Investors typically transfer coins from their wallets to exchanges when they lack confidence in the rally or resources to hold coins for long-term and want to liquidate their investments.      As such, one may argue that additional supply has poured into exchanges. While that seems to be the case, the buying pressure, as represented by the inflow of the largest stablecoin tether (USDT) into exchanges, has also strengthened.      See also: Tether’s Supply on Compound Jumps to Over $224M in a Week      Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that peg their market value to some external reference, usually the U.S. dollar. Tether and other major stablecoins are widely used to fund cryptocurrency purchases and their market capitalization has grown enormously this year. Tether, the largest dollar-backed stablecoin, crossed a $10 billion market cap earlier this month.      Tether inflows surged by over 440 million USDT to 726 million USDT on Monday, as per Chainalysis. “There was $726 million worth of demand for bitcoin entering into exchanges yesterday to balance the $1.3 billion worth of bitcoin looking to sell,” Philip Gradwell, chief economist at Chainalysis, tweeted early Tuesday.      And while the inflow of tether was less than that of bitcoin, there are other means to buy cryptocurrencies. “There will also be demand from fiat,” Gradwell noted.      Thus flows suggests the buying pressure may be strong enough to absorb the extra supply that has come onto exchanges and bitcoin may finally succeed in establishing a strong foothold above $10,000.      At press time, bitcoin was changing hands near $11,140, having tested dip demand with a drop to levels below $10,600 during the European trading hours.",NEUTRAL,BTC | USDT,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/28/bitcoins-latest-rally-may-have-staying-power-exchange-flows-suggest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ad9105799d70b2c61c129f4e4863b43b14bb0b50-1920x1356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384217,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1JGR,1595959220,Proof-of-Stake Chains Team Up to Prove DeFi Is Bigger Than Ethereum,"Liquidity mining is coming to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains.      Anchor, the new decentralized finance (DeFi) platform from Terra, Cosmos, Web3 Foundation and Solana, is being designed to launch with a governance-token reward. Version 1 is going live in October, according to a Terra co-founder.      Anchor is a two-pronged platform for PoS token holders. The system offers savings accounts and a lending platform – the bread and butter that made DeFi on Ethereum a multibillion-dollar enterprise.      ""We've been looking at ways in order to earn passive income on our users, for unused balances in unused assets,"" Do Kwon, a co-founder of Terra and the startup built atop it, Chai, told CoinDesk in a phone call. Terra is a two-token stablecoin protocol that has risen to prominence in Korea as a payments provider known for saving users money.      As Kwon explained, Alipay rapidly gained market share by promising users a better savings rate if they held cash in their mobile app. Kwon believes his team can craft a DeFi system that can produce a predictable rate of return that performs considerably better than bank savings.      Further, if the trends so far hold, adding a liquidity mining element should bolster those returns.      Read more: What Is Yield Farming? The Rocket Fuel of DeFi, Explained      The new governance token is likely to be named Anchor, like the platform, Kwon said. It will distribute over the course of five years and there will be no pre-mine for Anchor's creators.      While it's launching with a small set of PoS tokens, Kwon said Anchor hopes to make it very easy for other projects to join by meeting a set of technical standards. ""We really imagine this closer to the Rosetta standard that Coinbase published,"" Kwon said.    How Anchor will work    ""One of the general trends of DeFi is can you give consumers something that looks like a savings account, that is a yield-paying crypto asset,"" Zaki Manian, founder of Iqlusion and a leader in the Cosmos ecosystem, told CoinDesk in a phone call.      The first thing that has to be understood about DeFi is this: When someone deposits a token somewhere to earn yield, what they get back is a token. Users don't have an account like in Web2; they have a wallet. Depositors get a digital note in their wallet after making a deposit, and they can as easily give that to someone else as hold onto it.      Staking works the same way. PoS protocols require their validators (which function like bitcoin miners) to post a stake to do the computational work that blockchains require. Validators ante up to win block rewards, and their stake is at risk if they misbehave.      ""Staking is DeFi,"" Solana CEO Anatoly Yakovenko told CoinDesk in a phone call. ""Composability between chains is fairly easy to build between proof-of-stake networks.""    Spreading the wealth    One fear PoS leaders have had is that a few big operations would dominate all the networks. The most obvious threat: major centralized exchanges. They can give traders convenience and staking returns, which is tough to beat.      ""If there isn't a decentralized alternative to this, proof-of-stake is not a viable idea. This is the frontier,"" Manian said.      This new token represents a future claim to yield. So, for example, if a Cosmos investor deposited 100 ATOM onto a staking platform advertising a 5% annual yield, they would get a token back for their deposit. If they traded that token in at the end of a year, they would get back 105 ATOM. Anchor calls these tokens that represent stakes bTokens.      Much like Compound or MakerDAO, Anchor will let PoS holders deposit bTokens as an asset on Anchor. These will serve as collateral for stablecoin loans (initially, these are likely to be primarily stablecoins created with Terra).      On the consumer side, users will be able to make stablecoin deposits in Terra and earn a predictable return.      ""We now have means to turn Anchor into a turnkey asset for passive income,"" Kwon said.      Manian concurred. ""I'm interested in this because A.) DeFi and B.) the potential for what seems like a wider consumer product,"" he said.    Terra update    The Korea-based stablecoin project was first announced with a $32 million investment led by Binance in August 2018.      In October, Terra reported $54 million of payments through its Chai wallet app.      Read more: ‘Clicks and Bricks’ Strategy to Drive Korean Users to Terra’s Blockchain      Terra has risen to be tied for fourth place as a payments platform in Korea, Kwon said. No small feat.      For users, Chai is able to provide users with discounts funded by new token emissions, which get minted whenever demand starts to push the price above its target.      Chai has already brokered a partnership for access to the Mongolian market. Kwon said travel restrictions under COVID-19 have dramatically slowed the team's ability to access other markets, although Taiwan is the next step.      It's another small country, but it has a lot of e-commerce activity, and Terra was created with e-commerce in mind.      While Chai hasn't shown up in the U.S. yet, Kwon is working on a partnership now that would enable U.S. customers to put funds into Anchor using fiat, over regulated payment rails. Further, its expansion to Solana reflects a larger strategy to expand Terra's footprint.      ""We are building bridges to all the 'layer ones' that don't currently have stablecoins,"" Kwon said.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | ETH | MARKET | MINING | SOL,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/07/28/proof-of-stake-chains-team-up-to-prove-defi-is-bigger-than-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66a065c348d0ed391405e8ff4b3cded139f35c36-1177x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Coin Metrics reported Tuesday more than 3.1 million daily contract calls had gone through on July 25, an all-time high.

Coin Metrics analysts excluded from the figures abnormal network activity from a distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attack in October 2016, which saw daily contract calls spike from around 30,000 daily to 40 million.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk the July 25 all-time high was much more ""organic.""  The last time contract calls breached the three million milestone was during the ""Black Thursday"" sell-off on March 12.  This surge in daily contract calls coincides with a resurging ether (ETH), the price of which has increased 26% in a week, from $236 to $320 by press time.

42384216,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1JCf,1595954424,MIT Lightning Creator Unveils First 'Demonstration' of Bitcoin Scaling Tech,"The infrastructure propping up Bitcoin might become easier for anyone to spin up and run.      Lightning creator Tadge Dryja has been working on a new design for a lighter weight Bitcoin full node, about which he first wrote a paper in 2019. Last week, he and a team of coders released a first version of the Utreexo software as a part of MIT Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), putting the idea of lighter nodes into working code.      Full Bitcoin nodes act like financial security systems, validating Bitcoin blockchain transactions and protecting users from being tricked into thinking they received money that they didn't. But they take up a lot of computing space and are quickly growing in size.      Since these nodes are the most ""trustless"" way of using Bitcoin, developers have long been trying to make them easier to use. It's one of Bitcoin's nerdy ""holy grails.""      Read more: Jonas Schnelli Wants You to Run a Bitcoin Full Node      Utreexo specifically tackles the size of the ""state"" of a full node, which shows up-to-date information about who owns how much bitcoin. Utreexo slashes this state size from roughly four gigabytes to less than a kilobyte. In that regard, it could be a big breakthrough.      ""Utreexo is a new scalability technology for Bitcoin, which can make Bitcoin nodes smaller and faster while keeping the same security and privacy as full nodes,"" Dryja wrote in the blog post announcing the release.      But it hasn't been implemented fully yet, which is why it is a big deal to see Dryja releasing a first version of it. The project still has a long journey to go before users can begin using the nodes to plant a flag of financial self-sovereignty. But it's a crucial first step.    A 'super-pruned node'    Bitcoin full nodes hold every transaction ever made, clocking in at about 200 GB today.      ""Pruned"" full nodes are able to reduce the size of the transaction history to as low as a half a gigabyte, about the size required to store an episode of a TV show.      But this doesn't tackle the storage of Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs), which tallies up how much bitcoin is linked to each bitcoin address. This batch of data takes up a little less than 4 GB of data.      This UTXO state has grown rapidly over time and it is likely to continue growing, making it harder to run full nodes.      That's where Utreexo comes in. With the help of fancy, new cryptography, it's possible to replace this bulk of state with one tiny cryptographic proof that takes up much less storage.      Read more: Lightning Co-Creator Releases Code for Bitcoin Scaling Concept      ""Utreexo is a novel hash based dynamic accumulator, which allows the millions of unspent outputs to be represented in under a kilobyte – small enough to be written on a sheet of paper,"" Dryja explains on the MIT DCI website.      Because it does what a pruned node does, plus more, one bitcoiner called it a ""super-pruned node,” Dryja told CoinDesk.    Challenging SPV    Trying to shave down these hefty Bitcoin full nodes is far from a new pursuit. Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) is probably the most popular version of a lightweight node, used by Electrum and other wallets.      Utreexo is similar to SPV in that it doesn't require nearly as much computer storage space as a full node. But SPV nodes don't preserve user privacy as well and are more susceptible to attacks than Utreexo nodes are.      Since Utreexo offers these security benefits, Dryja hopes it might chip away at SPV's dominance in the space (as long as writing the Utreexo software goes as well as planned). ""I think it would be great if it replaced SPV to some extent, allowing an Electrum-like user experience but with Bitcoin Core security,"" he told CoinDesk.      Read more: Could SPV Support a Billion Bitcoin Users? Sizing up a Scaling Claim      But in the end, he doesn't think it'll replace SPV completely, as SPV is still easier to run.      ""I think it will be a bit in between. [Utreexo nodes are] heavier than SPV but lighter than current full nodes, so some SPV users may switch to Utreexo, and some current full node users will switch as well,"" he said.      He also imagines that since Utreexo nodes are so much easier to run, they'll be much more common than normal full nodes.      ""Longer term, I can definitely see almost all full nodes using a Utreexo-like design, and nodes which store the entire state and history would be more like current blockchain explorer websites or Electrum servers – there will still be some, but no normal users will run their own,"" Dryja said.    Careful next steps    Utreexo developers now put forward a proof of concept, showing that the idea can be turned into a real working product. But they still have a lot of work to do, including ironing out bugs to make the mini node suitable for real money.      ""The software also operates on testnet, the Bitcoin testing network, and is not recommended for use with real money. There are still plenty of known bugs and inefficiencies in the code, but we’re improving it at a rapid pace,"" Dryja writes.      They'll eventually have to make the Utreexo node compatible with the nodes already running on the Bitcoin network. To do this, developers will eventually need to modify Bitcoin Core, the most popular Bitcoin node software.      But this could be dangerous. Utreexo is ""a significant re-thinking of how Bitcoin works, changing consensus-critical code,"" Dryja writes.      ""It is thus likely to be difficult to get Utreexo code into Bitcoin Core, and with good reason. We want to be very sure to not introduce problems into a system handling so many people’s money,"" Dryja said.      That's why they've decided to see if they can try to add Utreexo's magical powers to alternative Bitcoin node software Btcd first, because it's not used by nearly as many people to secure their money, ""and in the process learn more about how it affects full node operation,"" Dryja said. The next step will be eventually applying what they learned to Bitcoin Core.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Alyssa Hertig,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/07/28/mit-lightning-creator-unveils-first-demonstration-of-bitcoin-scaling-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4dbf4ff590e6514331a92ff23ee8646d9b1ea77d-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42384206,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1J3r,1595953800,CFTC Chair: 'A Large Part' of Financial System Could End Up in Blockchain Format,"Perfection shouldn’t be the enemy of good when it comes to regulating the cryptocurrency space, said Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman Heath Tarbert.      The nation’s top commodities regulator, who recently marked his first anniversary at the CFTC, detailed his approach to cryptocurrency in a wide-ranging interview with CoinDesk. Tarbert noted that many of crypto’s unique attributes – namely borderlessness and decentralization -- require a thoughtful approach.      “Our entire financial and economic system outside the current system, the non-crypto system basically evolved since, one could argue, the Renaissance in Italy,” he said. “Whereas what people are doing in the digital asset space is effectively building within a decade or less an entire economic system based on human incentives and trust … I just find that fascinating.”      Tarbert specified that he is interested in the way developers are incorporating “hundreds of years of accumulated knowledge about human behavior and economic incentives” as well as cryptographic methods originally used in national security applications to build these digital commerce systems.      Read more: Regulated Derivatives Will ‘Legitimize’ Crypto, Says CFTC Chair      Tarbert said he is fascinated by decentralized finance (DeFi).      “When you think about the idea that at some point a large part of our financial system could very well exist in blockchain format, that's also revolutionary,” he said.    Building out    Tarbert took office on July 15, 2019, coming to the regulatory agency from the U.S. Treasury Department, where he served as Assistant Secretary for International Markets. He said that while he was familiar with bitcoin and digital assets prior to joining the agency, “I quickly found out that this is such a rapidly changing environment that I needed to really bone up” on.      While many aspects of the crypto and fintech spaces aren’t currently under the CFTC’s jurisdiction, some new products might someday fall into the derivatives space. So Tarbert needs to learn about much more than just bitcoin.      “My view is that to be a successful CFTC chairman, meaning regulating the derivatives market, you have to have [a] keen understanding of the underlying market,” he said. “And so I've tried to learn as much as I can about the various agricultural sectors. I've gone out into fields and ... gone to grain elevators, I've gone to a feedlot to learn about cattle and wheat. I'm learning about oil but I'm also learning a lot about crypto and in many ways, because it's so revolutionary and so cutting edge, I'm spending a lot of time just learning how it all works in the ecosystem.”      Read more: CFTC Approves Bitnomial to Offer Futures Contracts Settled in Real Bitcoin      Tarbert’s efforts are paying off. Tarbert pointed to the elevation of LabCFTC, the agency’s fintech wing, noting it had grown from being a small group within the CFTC’s general counsel’s office to becoming its own division.      In the months since, the CFTC has declared ether a commodity, allowed the first ether-based futures products to enter the market and approved actual delivery guidance that explains to exchanges when the CFTC has jurisdiction and brought numerous enforcement actions, Tarbert said.      The next challenge is building out a holistic regulatory framework for crypto and its derivatives markets in the coming years.      “I suspect some of it will be principles-based and some of it will be more specific rules … the right blend of each to allow for innovation and also flexibility both for market participants but also for ourselves because we don't want a regulatory framework to be obsolete six months after it's introduced, but at the same time, there may be customer protection and maybe some other issues that are so important that we want to provide very clear standards and rules to provide clarity,” he said.    Novel questions    Tarbert said the planned framework, announced earlier this month, won’t be a prescriptive one, but a holistic approach that looks at how the agency regulates derivatives markets. This will require the CFTC to evaluate how it looks at exchanges, clearinghouses and other market intermediaries, and how its core principles apply or should apply to the space.      “We have some things listed on exchanges, but most of those, they’re either cash-settled products or they are fully collateralized,” he said. “So we actually haven't gotten into a system where we actually have physically delivered digital asset products that have the kind of margining and practices associated with them as we do other futures contracts and even swaps.”      The CFTC doesn’t want to over- or under-regulate the space, he said.      “We have rules regarding custody of assets, so how do we handle custody and settlement?” Tarbert said. “We know how to do it with traditional physical assets and with cash but how do we do that with digital assets?”      Capital requirements, segregating customer assets with broker assets, market intermediary reporting and bankruptcy are other issues that need to be addressed within this framework, he said.      Pricing risk for crypto asset derivatives sold on margin is another area the CFTC is examining.      Read more: What the CFTC Chairman Actually Said About Ether Futures and Ethereum 2.0      “What about if there's a failure?” he asked. “Non-default loss at the clearinghouse, meaning the clearinghouse loses money not because one of the members fails but, rather, it loses custody of these assets or it loses the keys or something, and then what role should insurance play?”      This extends to infrastructure and physical hardware questions, and whether the CFTC should replicate its current regulations for the digital asset market or try to fit digital assets into an already existing framework.      These issues illustrate the need for a flexible framework, Tarbert said, one which takes into account these major questions but can still be applied flexibly as different aspects of the crypto space evolve.      As an added wrinkle, the CFTC won’t know for sure if its framework is effective until it’s implemented.      “You're dealing with a counterfactual, so you can't say, well, ‘how would things have evolved if we didn't have this framework in place?’ The answer is, it's a really important process but it needs to happen,” he said.      The G20’s Financial Stability Board underwent a similar process and the U.S. Treasury Department had to create rules around capital controls after the 2008 financial crisis as well, so Tarbert’s not a stranger to this type of challenge.      “It's a very difficult question, but I think we owe it both to ourselves as well as market participants that after a reasonable period of, let's say five years, we take a look back and say, ‘what are we doing right, what did we do wrong and what changes need to be made,’” he said. “It's easier said than done, but it does need to be done.”    Borderless    The CFTC also has to contend with the fact that crypto is inherently borderless. Market participants and developers all hail from different jurisdictions, and many live outside the U.S.      The U.S. should harmonize its approach to crypto both across the 50 states and additional territories, as well as with how other nations are approaching it, Tarbert said, likening the new asset class to other commodities under its jurisdiction.      “Commodities are commodities all around the world, right? Wheat is wheat ...and so the commodity prices and the derivatives prices based on those commodities around the world are all interconnected,” he said. “Well now we take digital assets, crypto assets … and there they are uniform. And ... people are not thinking about regulatory and national boundaries, by definition, this stuff is outside of it.”      Read more: CFTC Seeks Industry Advice on Blockchain Applications      The CFTC joined the Global Financial Innovation Network as one step in this process, collaborating with regulators worldwide to share ideas about financial innovation. The agency is also part of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), where Tarbert is the current vice-chairman.      Other international efforts include the Financial Stability Board, which has a working group on stablecoins (cryptocurrencies which maintain price parity with a fiat currency or asset like the U.S. dollar) and the Financial Action Task Force, which published guidance on crypto exchanges last year.      In his view, future international standards around crypto “will be as important to this community” as the Basel Accords developed across the past 30 years are to the banking sector today.      That’s not to say there shouldn’t be a national regulatory regime, Tarbet said.      “But I think there’s a real acknowledgement from national regulators that there needs to be enhanced international cooperation and thinking, and to some extent if at all possible, some degree of convergence,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/07/28/cftc-chair-a-large-part-of-financial-system-could-end-up-in-blockchain-format,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c98ae3955a07351d9eaa87dd28939903594d9673-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rattaggi said the list could shift based on coin performance.      De-Funded Cryptocurrency hedge fund Tetras Capital is shutting down and returning investors’ money after quarters of low returns, an anonymous source told CoinDesk. The New York-based fund, founded in 2017, recorded a 75% loss life-to-date. At its height, Tetras managed upwards of $33 million, according to financial filings, with an investment thesis centered around shorting ether and investing in alt-coins. At least 68 crypto hedge funds closed last year internationally, almost double the number – 35 – in 2018, according to a Crypto Fund Research report.      SEN's Zen Silvergate Bank continued to book new cryptocurrency customers in the second quarter while its portfolio of bitcoin-collateralized loans nearly doubled. According to its latest earnings report, the bank’s $1.1 billion traditional loans increased only 0.1% from the first quarter. Bitcoin-collateralized loans through the bank’s SEN Leverage product surged 88% in the same period, to $22.5 million.

The platform has been bolstering its anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards in response to the European Union’s AMLD5 and new Finnish business regulations. Recently, LocalBitcoins has suspended cash-for-crypto trading and added mandatory identity verification.      Sustainable Investments Fasset, a fintech company headquartered in the U.K., has launched an Ethereum-based operating system dedicated to the ethical financing of sustainable infrastructure. The system tokenizes investments made in sustainable infrastructure – like solar power plants, wind farms and fiber optic – and makes them tradable among global investors. By moving the entire financing process to the blockchain, the firm intends to improve liquidity in the sustainable infrastructure sector and lower barriers to entry that will enable asset owners to avoid costly middlemen and directly list their assets on exchanges.

Ethereum’s Devcon 1, held in London in November 2015, was like Woodstock, except perhaps with less nudity.      Bankers and Big 4 consultants disguised in hoodies shared space with dreadlocked Ethereum coders, sitting cross-legged in the corners, their laptops open in front of them.      Packed into a Victorian banking hall in the heart of the City of London, the audience listened as ConsenSys chief Joe Lubin predicted a new future for firms; cryptographer Nick Szabo talked about decentralization in the context of Francis Drake and the Aztecs; and chief scientist Vitalik Buterin assembled shards of the path that lay ahead.      “The internet kind of sucks,” said Ethereum wallet designer Alex Van de Sande during his opening keynote. “It’s centralized, and it’s broken – but we can fix it this week.”      Such was the optimism in the room.      Keeping with the Woodstock motif, this moment in time possessed a kind of prelapsarian innocence: The DAO debacle and hard fork decision that followed was at least six months away, and further off still was the ICO gold rush.      An earlier confab, Berlin’s Devcon 0, preceded Ethereum’s launch. In London, things were starting to get real.    Market intel    Bitcoin's Bounce Bitcoin’s futures trading volume recorded triple-digit growth Monday, as institutions and investors raced into a market primed for a bull run. Aggregate daily futures volume on major exchanges reached $43 billion, the highest single-day volume since March 13, according to data source Skew. Daily trading volume on institutional exchange CME rose 570% to a yearly high of $1.32 billion, Bakkt registered a record volume of $132 million and total open interest for all exchanges rose to $5 billion – the highest since February.      Yearly Highs: Bitcoin & Gold Bitcoin’s 13% price jump to 2020 highs of $11,180 on Monday came as the dollar’s value slides. This move was in tandem with gold’s newly set all-time high, both of which are referred to as inflation hedges. Bitcoin is up 57% year to date, more than double the 28% gain this year for gold, while the S&P is flat for the year. “Given gold has just set a new all-time high, and with bitcoin’s correlation to stocks breaking down while being replaced by a strong correlation to gold, we envisage further tests to the upside this coming week,” Diginex wrote in a report. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Currency Index, a gauge of the greenback’s value versus other major currencies, has fallen for seven straight sessions. A weakening dollar “mechanically pushes up the prices of the commodities invoiced in greenbacks,” according to the Wall Street Journal.    Tech pod    Launchpad Before Launch Ethereum developers have released a ""validator launchpad"" on the Medalla testnet to educate and prepare future validators as part of a multi-stage roll out of Ethereum 2.0. The transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the core component of Eth 2, is designed to improve the system’s scalability. According to an announcement, three phases of the roll out are planned, with the first, phase 0, focusing on the underlying tech behind staking by tracking validators and their balances. The launchpad, which comes before phase 0, will enable validators to track and deposit test stakes on the upcoming Medalla multi-client testnet.    Opinion    Millennial Moves Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis, thinks millennials are shaping the future of money. From fashion to tech, a millennial “desire for autonomy and granular choice” is now extending to finance. “For most of the past hundred years, retail finance was dominated by a small number of regional, and later national, institutions. No more: 71% of millennials would change banks based on the quality of an app, and a full third of us say we won’t need a bank at all in the future,” he writes.

Bitcoin soared above $11,400 on Monday, but this volatility only triggered the bankruptcy price for only $133 million worth of bitcoin futures contracts on BitMEX, the leading bitcoin derivatives exchange, according to Skew.  Breaking above $10,500 was a critical bullish market signal for many traders since bitcoin had stayed below that price since September 2019.  Monday’s liquidations are less than half the amount of contracts closed by liquidation on May 10, when bitcoin briefly dropped 15% to $8,100 from a daily open of $9,500.  Significant bitcoin price movements generally trigger the liquidation of hundreds of millions in futures contracts by reaching pockets of market liquidity that has accumulated over time or are traded with excessive leverage.  “Everyone knows this is going up,” said Zoran Scekic, managing partner at cryptocurrency trading firm Zorax Capital, adding that he doesn’t think retail traders are in over-leveraged short positions at this point, which could be the reason behind relatively low levels of liquidated futures contracts.

42384188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1EPl,1595944068,Why Bitcoin-Like Scarcity Would Be a Disaster for the Dollar,"Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.      There’s a widespread belief that the exorbitant quantity of money the Federal Reserve is pouring into the U.S. economy must eventually mean the return of high inflation. After all, if there’s lots more money but no more stuff to buy, prices must rise, mustn’t they? So the prospect of Judy Shelton – known for her support of the gold standard – joining the Fed’s Board of Governors is raising the hopes of those who want the Fed to be stripped of its money creation powers.      But the Fed’s mandate is price stability. And, as I shall explain, if the Fed can’t vary the quantity of money in circulation in response to economic circumstances, it can’t stabilize the price of a dollar.      See also: Jill Carlson - How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Money Printer      What is the “price” of a dollar? Some people like to express the dollar’s price in terms of gold – though as the dollar hasn’t been backed by gold since 1971, this is perhaps a bad attack of nostalgia. For them, the dollar’s price is anything but stable and the Fed is fatally undermining it.      Goldbugs think the rise in the dollar price of gold over the last century means the dollar is worthless (despite me arguing about it with them for hours). I have had similar arguments with people who think that massive rises in the stock market/bond market/real estate/bitcoin mean the dollar is hyperinflating. But as the dollar is not backed by assets, the rising price of assets tells us absolutely nothing about the price of a dollar.      For ordinary U.S. people and businesses, the price of a dollar is its purchasing power. The dollar’s domestic purchasing power is the quantity of U.S. goods and services U.S. residents can purchase with their own currency. The rate at which the dollar’s purchasing power changes is known as the “inflation rate.”      If people reject a currency in favor of gold or another currency, its purchasing power falls to zero. This is known as “hyperinflation.” It has never happened to the U.S. dollar.    If the Fed wants the price of dollars to remain stable, it has no choice but to accommodate that demand by creating lots more dollars.    For foreigners, the price of a dollar is its exchange rate versus their own currency. The exchange rate is the quantity of another currency that one dollar can purchase. This in turn determines not only the quantity of externally produced goods and services that U.S. residents can purchase with dollars, but also the quantity of U.S.-produced goods and services that foreigners can purchase with their own currencies. We can therefore regard the exchange rate as measuring the dollar’s purchasing power outside the U.S.      A fall in the exchange rate means one dollar purchases fewer foreign-made goods and services. The rate at which the exchange rate falls is thus the external equivalent of the domestic inflation rate.      Exchange rate collapse destroys the external purchasing power of the currency, just as hyperinflation destroys its domestic purchasing power. Indeed, the two are often seen together. If the country has large amounts of debt denominated in foreign currencies, exchange rate collapse can mean it becomes unable to service these debts.      Furthermore, if the country is dependent on imports, a sudden exchange rate fall can mean it can’t pay for imports. All too often, the government’s response to these disasters is to print enormous amounts of its own currency in the hope of exchanging it for the foreign currency it needs. This fuels the exchange rate collapse and triggers domestic hyperinflation.      In the past, central banks and governments regarded the exchange rate as the most important price. They thought countries must “earn their way” in the world by exporting goods and services to other countries, and they knew controlling the exchange rate would help them to export. They also feared that if a country allowed its exchange rate to float against other currencies it would collapse, resulting in hyperinflation. So they pegged their currencies to gold or other assets, or even to each other.      “Fear of floating” determined monetary policy long after the end of the gold standard. Indeed, for many developing countries it still does. As recently as the 1980s, the Fed was actively managing the dollar’s exchange rate, aided by other central banks.      But after the failure of the Louvre Accord in 1989, the Fed switched to managing the dollar’s domestic purchasing power instead of the exchange rate. Along with most major central banks, it set a target of 2% per annum consumer price inflation and allowed the exchange rate to float.      Since then, the Fed has managed inflation by adjusting the interest rate it charges banks to borrow dollars. Bank lending creates purchasing power. Increasing banks’ borrowing costs encourages them to charge more for loans to individuals and businesses, which damps demand for loans and thus reduces bank lending. When bank lending falls, the rate at which purchasing power increases also falls. In other words, less bank lending means lower consumer price inflation.      Of course, U.S. banks create dollars when they lend. But the Fed doesn’t directly control the quantity of dollars they create. And it doesn’t restrict its own money creation either. It creates reserves in response to demand from banks, and provides liquidity to financial markets in response to signals from market participants. Contrary to popular opinion, this is intended not to allow inflation to run out of control but to maintain it at around the Fed’s 2% inflation target.      To understand why the Fed can’t meet its price stability mandate by directly controlling the quantity of dollars in circulation, it’s helpful to look at bitcoin’s behavior. Bitcoin’s algorithms control its quantity, not its price. The quantity of bitcoin in circulation increases at a constant rate and is ultimately limited to 21 million (even though this won’t be reached in the lifetime of anyone alive today).      See also: Frances Coppola - ‘Money Printer Go Brrr’ Is How the Dollar Retains Reserve Status      The result of controlling the quantity of bitcoin rather than its price is price instability. Bitcoin’s price is subject to wild swings as demand for it fluctuates, while its quantity does not. This roller-coaster ride doesn’t really matter for bitcoin, because almost no one is buying their weekly shopping with it or hodling their life savings in it. But for the millions of people whose livelihoods depend on the dollar, price swings of the kind all too often seen on the bitcoin charts would be disastrous.      As we saw in September last year and March this year, international demand for dollars heads for the moon at times of crisis. So if the Fed wants the price of dollars to remain stable, it has no choice but to accommodate that demand by creating lots more dollars. This would still be true if it were targeting the exchange rate, by the way. International dollar shortages cause the dollar’s exchange rate to rise.      If the Fed adopted some kind of algorithm that kept the rate of money creation constant, or linked the dollar to gold or some other asset, the result would be renewed instability both in the dollar’s external value and its domestic purchasing power, not on the upside (exchange rate collapse and hyperinflation really are not a serious risk) but on the downside. We know from the 1930s that when the Fed is prevented by a rule or a gold standard from creating enough money to ease a crisis, the result is debt deflation and severe economic depression.

42384193,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1ETX,1595941200,Fireblocks Claims Exchange Program Enables Zero-Confirmation Crypto Deposits,"Digital asset storage and transaction firm Fireblocks is hoping to drastically speed up cryptocurrency trades for big players and institutions.    The company launched what it calls the Deposit Acceleration Program on Tuesday, a system that is claimed to offer crypto deposits on exchanges with zero confirmations in real time.  The program would greatly reduce the time it takes to settle large transactions on-chain and has potential to bring fresh institutional trading volume to exchanges, according to a press release provided to CoinDesk.  Stephen Richardson, Fireblocks' VP on product strategy, told CoinDesk the program effectively locks digital assets into a transaction, preventing the possibility of an inadvertent double-spend or resubmission of the transaction.  Most exchanges require the digital assets to be loaded on their platform before trading – a process that can take from 10 minutes to 24 hours, depending on network and levels of congestion.  A deposit isn't normally available on an exchange until the transaction has been confirmed a number of times by miners on the cryptocurrency's network.  This delay poses a problem for those wanting to quickly take advantage of arbitrage opportunities or those exchanges running on tight liquidity margins, Fireblocks said.  Antigua and Barbuda-based crypto derivatives exchange FTX has become the first to join the program, meaning Fireblocks customers can now send cryptos to FTX with zero confirmations in real time.  The firm is hoping to partner with more exchanges on the program.

42384200,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1EhN,1595938443,Bitcoin Futures Volume Surges 186% as Price Hits $11K,"Bitcoin’s derivative market sprang back to life on Monday with futures trading volume witnessing a triple-digit growth on the back of increased participation from U.S. based institutions.    Aggregate daily futures volume on major exchanges surged 186% to $43 billion, the highest single-day volume since March 13, according to data source Skew.  Daily trading volume on institutional exchange CME rose 570% to a yearly high of $1.32 billion; Bakkt registered a record volume of $132 million.  Total open interest rose to $5 billion, the highest since February.  Volumes declined sharply amid dull bitcoin price action, but picked up again as bitcoin crossed $10,400 – a bullish breakout.  The price rise was a combination of increasing retail demand and institutional volumes, said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank.  Joel Kruger, a currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk bitcoin now looks overextended, suggesting we could soon see a healthy correction, especially with the global outlook increasingly uncertain and the price of bitcoin still vulnerable to weakness in stocks as was seen in March.  The bitcoin supply – which fell to a 12-month low in Q2 – might now increase again as miners look to sell their coins on the open market, adding additional downside pressure.

42384201,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1Eid,1595935647,First Mover: The Dollar Drop May Have Helped Push Bitcoin Past $11K,"As the U.S. dollar's value slides, prices are suddenly rising for just about everything priced in dollars.      That includes bitcoin, which shot up some 13% on Monday for its biggest gain in almost three months. Prices soared past levels reached in February, prior to the pandemic-induced sell-off, reaching a new 2020 high of $11,180.      You’re reading First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more. We follow the money so you don’t have to. You can subscribe here.      Joe DiPasquale, CEO of the cryptocurrency hedge fund BitBull Capital, told First Mover in an email that the latest move up appeared ""in sync"" with gold's climb in recent days to a new record. Bitcoin is seen by many digital-asset analysts as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, similar to the way investors in traditional markets have historically used gold.      ""Bitcoin sprung into action,"" DiPasquale said.      It's a remarkable development in the bitcoin market, where investors, as recently as last week, were despairing that the oldest and largest cryptocurrency had been stuck in a range between $9,000 and $10,000 for the past two months.      So for bitcoin bulls, the jolt out of the doldrums was welcome, especially when the price went up, not down. The day's gain came on strong trading volume, with levels not seen since early June.      “The trend is clear and we are headed higher,” said Jack Tan, of Taiwan-based quantitative trading firm Kronos Research.      Bitcoin is now up 57% year to date, more than double the 28% gain this year for gold, which climbed in recent days to a record. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index of large U.S. stocks, meanwhile, is roughly flat for the year.      ""Given gold has just set a new all-time high, and with bitcoin's correlation to stocks breaking down while being replaced by a strong correlation to gold, we envisage further tests to the upside this coming week,"" the cryptocurrency-trading firm Diginex wrote in a daily market report.      The U.S. Dollar Currency Index, a gauge of the greenback's value versus other major currencies like the euro and yen, has fallen for seven straight sessions; the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs predicts the dollar could lose another 5% over the next 12 months.      ""The U.S. dollar is eroding quickly, and people are starting to notice,"" wrote Mati Greenspan, founder of the cryptocurrency and foreign-exchange research firm Quantum Economics, in his daily email. ""It's plain to see that people are ditching the buck as fast as they can.""      That's good for bitcoin and gold: As the Wall Street Journal put it Monday, a weakening dollar ""mechanically pushes up the prices of the commodities invoiced in greenbacks.""      Investors appear worried the global economic recovery is faltering, with cases on the rise and a death toll globally that just passed 650,000. In the U.S. Congress, Senate Republicans proposed a $1 trillion relief package following negotiations with President Donald Trump, but that amount falls far short of a Democrat-led plan for $3.5 trillion in stimulus.      Jim Reid, strategist for the German lender Deutsche Bank, wrote in a report that the Federal Reserve, which has already expanded its balance sheet this year by about $3 trillion to about $7 trillion, might need to pump another $12 trillion over the next few years.      The Federal Reserve is scheduled to meet this week in closed-door discussions, with a statement due late Wednesday. With interest rates already close to zero, no major policy changes are expected, but the cryptocurrency investment fund Arca noted Monday that a sell-off in the U.S. stock market might provoke the U.S. central bank to respond.      A report on Thursday is expected to show that U.S. gross domestic product declined during the second quarter by a staggering 35% on an annualized basis.      With so much fragility in the economy, and things not improving quickly, ""the moral hazard is now so high that the stock market barely even has to blink,"" Arca wrote.      For bitcoin, according to Arca, ""the breakout was just a matter of time.""    Tweet of the day  Bitcoin watch    BTC: Price: $10,773 (BPI) | 24-Hr High: $11,395 | 24-Hr Low: $10,215      Trend: Bitcoin is witnessing a low-volume technical pullback on Tuesday.      The largest cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $10,850 - down over 4% from the 11-month high of $11,394 reached on Monday.      The drop in price suggests bitcoin may be overvalued. The 14-day relative strength index jumped to 82 as prices surged 11% on Monday. An above-70 reading indicates overbought conditions - meaning excessive demand has pushed prices unjustifiably high.      The pullback may be extended further, as the 14-day RSI is still hovering above 70. In addition, the RSI on the hourly chart has dropped into bearish territory below 50. That said, the bullish bias might be invalidated if prices finish below $10,500 (the February high) at the UTC market close.      That looks unlikely, as the decline from multi-month highs observed so far today is accompanied by a slide in trading volumes (above right). A low-volume pullback is often short-lived.      Besides, some analysts are convinced that Monday's bullish move has put bitcoin on the path toward record highs. ""[Monday's] daily close is amazing and could very well resemble April 2019's $1k candle that ended the bear market and fueled a rally to $13,000.

42384198,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1Eg7,1595930413,"Memories of London’s Devcon 1, Ethereum’s ‘Woodstock’ Moment","Ethereum’s Devcon 1, held in London in November 2015, was like Woodstock, except perhaps with less nudity.      Bankers and Big 4 consultants disguised in hoodies shared space with dreadlocked Ethereum coders, sitting cross-legged in the corners, their laptops open in front of them.      Packed into a Victorian banking hall in the heart of the City of London, the audience listened as ConsenSys chief Joe Lubin predicted a new future for firms; cryptographer Nick Szabo talked about decentralization in the context of Francis Drake and the Aztecs; and chief scientist Vitalik Buterin assembled shards of the path that lay ahead.      “The internet kind of sucks,” said Ethereum wallet designer Alex Van de Sande during his opening keynote. “It’s centralized, and it’s broken – but we can fix it this week.”      Such was the optimism in the room.      Keeping with the Woodstock motif, this moment in time possessed a kind of prelapsarian innocence: The DAO debacle and hard fork decision that followed was at least six months away, and further off still was the ICO gold rush.      An earlier confab, Berlin’s Devcon 0, preceded Ethereum’s launch. In London, things were starting to get real.    Shoestring budget    Today, Ethereum’s native cryptocurrency has a market cap of some $36 billion, but at that stage the Ethereum Foundation, which had managed an $18 million token sale, didn’t have any fiat currency on hand, recalls DARMA Capital managing partner Andrew Keys, the then-head of business development at ConsenSys.      “I had to lend the Ethereum Foundation $35,000 because they only had crypto. I had to put it on my credit card so we could reserve the room,” said Keys.      A couple of weeks before the London event, Keys had managed to broker a landmark deal with Microsoft Azure, the first big enterprise to really back Ethereum. The Wall Street Journal ran a story about Microsoft working with Ethereum, and on Oct. 27, 2015, the price of ether crossed one dollar. The publicity also enabled Keys and Marley Gray, principal architect at Microsoft Azure, to cobble together some vital sponsorship money.      “I had a very difficult time getting together the funds with Microsoft as a sponsor,” said Gray. “Then the WSJ interview went really well and I was able to secure $14,000, a sponsor table and a speaking slot to announce eBaaS, or Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service, on Azure. That table was just a card table of questionable stability, and the first thing out of most people’s mouths when they found out I was from Microsoft was, ‘What are you doing here?’”    OGs and FOMO    Another of the Ethereum OGs involved in the planning was venture investor William Mougayar, who remembers the general worry that the London event simply wouldn’t sell enough seats.      “We weren’t sure it was going to fill up,” said Mougayar. “We were giving discounts to attend. Then a week or so prior to the event, there was a fear of missing out and a swelling of attendance, resulting in a standing room situation that we ended up with.”      On the subject of FOMO, Mougayar organized an evening event at the London City offices of law firm Orrick, to introduce a gaggle of investors to Ethereum.      “We had some of the top Ethereum developers, such as the teams led by Gavin Wood, Jeff Wilcke, the nascent ConsenSys and the Foundation proper. But only three VCs showed up from about 18 that I invited,” recalled Mougayar. “Two of these VCs are leaders today in backing blockchain companies.”      Although investors never knew it at this stage, Ethereum was about to foster an explosion in crowdsales. In attendance at Devcon 1 was Fabien Vogelsteller, the inventor of the ERC-20 token standard that would launch a thousand ICOs.      “Devcon 1 showed us the sheer size of the developer community, just 10 months after the network launch,” said Vogelsteller, founder of LUKSO. “So, I did expect there to be an increase of ICOs, not only because of ERC-20, but because it just looked imminent.”    Bankers and boomers    This gathering of brave new disruptors found itself facing the old financial world, represented in a panel featuring the likes of Lee Braine of the technology office of Barclays Investment Bank.      This besuited boomer from Barclays must have looked like “the man” that you wanted to stick it to, at least to the cypherpunks and libertarians in the audience. (It’s worth noting, at that time the entire financial world and large parts of the legal system were expected to be soon replaced by smart contracts.)      “It was a heady time,” Braine recalls, “with an explosion of innovation coming from startups, big technology companies, universities, open-source communities and also the financial institutions themselves.”      Before too long the Devcon banking panel took the form of a lecture, with Braine asking the room how a system of blockchain-based smart contracts might handle some rather complicated netting cycles used by a large investment bank to optimize trade processing at scale.      In fact, Braine’s post-trade securities netting question is an example of where and when decentralization, though perhaps desirable, cannot achieve the efficiency of a centralized solution.      “It’s effectively a centralized batch optimization process,” said Braine. “I'm not aware of a genuinely distributed model that can achieve the same settlement efficiency.”      (Braine and his team have subsequently explored this problem using quantum computing power.)      Keys, who was moderating the banking panel, remembers Braine’s fiendishly complex challenge, and also the fact that the Barclays scientist was “fully suited.”      “But then he is a Brit,” said Keys, “and not some ding-dong from the U.S.”",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/28/memories-of-londons-devcon-1-ethereums-woodstock-moment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/235b578a3a87f96459ac8888a29030e467341438-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new research paper released on Tuesday reveals the state government's concerns over falling behind on disruptive technologies like blockchain.  The current climate of ""uncertainty"" has given way to unexpected scenarios, prompting the need to update regulations around such emerging technologies, the paper reads.  The Treasury acknowledged regulators need to catch up, saying falling behind the times is a growing problem.  The NSW Treasury is responsible for the management of the state's finances, advising on policy and developing governance frameworks, and supplying analysis and advice to industry.  With traditional regulatory models that oversee industry risk being challenged by societal changes, technological advancements and economic circumstances, the department recommends an ""outcome-based"" regulatory approach.  Such a model would provide ""flexibility"" for businesses to innovate and show appreciation for the potential of emerging technologies, without the need to seek approval from regulators.  An acceleration of reforms could bring benefits worth $4 billion for the NSW economy stemming from a 5% cut in regulatory compliance costs for emerging tech providers, the Treasury suggested.

42384183,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1ELz,1595925331,Staking on Ethereum 2.0 Takes First Step With Test System for Validators,"The transition to Ethereum 2.0 and its proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is finally underway.    Announced Monday, Ethereum developers have released a ""validator launchpad"" on the Medalla testnet to educate and prepare future validators as part of a multi-year, multi-stage roll out of the Ethereum network's most important upgrade to date.  Eth 2 will radically transform the world's largest smart contract platform as it shifts from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS).  In PoW, miners do the job of validating transactions through complex math solved by computer hardware and then adding them to a data block in a series, or chain, that is cryptographically secured.  PoS, on the other hand, lets entities known as validators lock up holdings of a network's cryptocurrency as collateral for the right to validate a transaction without the need for computer hardware. Validators are rewarded based on how much crypto they initially stake.  The transition to PoS is aimed to improve Ethereum's scalability issues that arise from its inability to handle a large quantity of transactions under PoW. PoS also expected to be more cost-effective than mining.  Three phases of the rollout are planned, with the first, phase 0, focusing on the underlying tech behind staking by tracking validators and their balances.  The launchpad, which comes before phase 0, will enable validators to track and deposit test stakes on the upcoming Medalla multi-client testnet.  When phase 0 arrives, validators will start securing Eth 2's network with real stakes.  Phases 2 and 3 will revolve around adding and storing Eth 2 data and enabling programs to be run on the network, respectively.  The legacy Ethereum platform will exist for some time as its own independent PoW chain, but the developers stressed the ""transition toward PoS starts now"" in Monday's announcement.

42384185,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXA1ENF,1595922467,Firm Uses Ethereum to Tokenize Sustainable Infrastructure in Fight Against Climate Change,"Fasset, a fintech company headquartered in the U.K., has launched what it claims is the world’s first operating system built on the Ethereum blockchain dedicated to the ethical financing of sustainable infrastructure.    Announced Tuesday, the system is intended to democratize investments in sustainable infrastructure, including the construction of solar power plants, wind farms and fiber optic networks, by tokenizing (creating digital representations of) those assets to make them accessible to a global pool of investors.  Mohammad Raafi Hossain, Fasset’s CEO and a former technology adviser to the United Arab Emirates' prime minister, told CoinDesk infrastructure assets are some of the most resilient and long-yielding financial assets, continuing to provide dividends long after the project is complete, because they provide important utilities to the public.  These infrastructural assets are useful and accessible to anyone, he said, irrespective of where they come from, just like a decentralized blockchain.  In a press release, Hossain said climate change is expected to cost the world economy $7.9 trillion by 2050, and that the need for sustainable infrastructure has never been more urgent.  The Fasset Enterprise Platform (FEP) enables hard-asset owners in sustainable infrastructure to tokenize their assets for fundraising purposes.  By moving the entire sustainable infrastructure financing process to the blockchain, the firm intends to improve liquidity in the sector and lower barriers to entry that will enable asset owners to avoid costly middlemen and directly list their assets on exchanges.  The initiative, inspired by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, is a response to rapid climate degradation and the lack of capital entering the sustainable infrastructure sector, which is moving toward a $15 trillion deficit by 2040.  Fasset’s primary objective is to bridge that deficit with blockchain-backed investments, Hossain said.  Founded in early 2019, the firm has already won the support of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Kuwait and Bahrain, and has raised over $4.7 million.  It also plans to launch a regulated exchange for hard assets in the near future.

LocalBitcoins announced Tuesday it’s using Elliptic’s Navigator risk analysis tool and Lens wallet screener to crack down on illicit crypto. Blockchain analysis firms have previously claimed that LocalBitcoins receives the bulk of Finland’s criminal coin.  The Helsinki-based platform has been bolstering its anti-money laundering (AML) safeguards in response to the European Union’s AMLD5 and tough new Finnish business regulations, both of which turned up the heat on regional crypto businesses.  In the run-up to Finland’s enforcement deadlines, LocalBitcoins ditched cash-for-crypto trading and added mandatory identity verification. It also banned Iranian users from trading bitcoin, likely in response to U.S. sanctions.  Elliptic Chief Scientist Tom Robinson told CoinDesk that such policy shifts have contributed to a 50% drop in darknet crypto inflows for the year.  “The reduction in flows from dark markets to peer-to-peer exchanges is a clear consequence of these businesses introducing strong KYC and AML controls,” he said. “Criminals are now thinking twice before trying to cash-out through the major peer-to-peer exchanges.”  LocalBitcoins did not respond to requests for additional comment.

The New York-based fund is shutting down and returning investors’ money after quarters of low returns, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke to CoinDesk on condition of anonymity.  The fund struggled to perform and posted about a 75% loss life-to-date since opening in 2017, the source said.  Tetras Capital managed upwards of $33 million at one point for more than 60 investors who pitched in at least $100,000 apiece, according to financial filings.    Tetras Capital’s closure adds to a growing line of cryptocurrency hedge funds folding after crypto prices slid from peak highs in 2017.    According to a Crypto Fund Research report, at least 68 crypto hedge funds closed last year internationally, almost double the number – 35 – in 2018.    The fund launched in 2017 with a focus on altcoins, Tetras Capital co-founder Alex Sunnarborg said in a 2019 Forbes interview.    Alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, are digital assets other than bitcoin.  One altcoin trade Tetras claimed to have made was a short position on the cryptocurrency ether at a price of $700 in May 2018, according to the interview and a fund investment report.  The short view appears to have been the right call, as ether tumbled below $100 last year and has lately been trading in the $200 range.  Sunnarborg, a former Raymond James and CoinDesk analyst who sold crypto-asset market research app Lawnmower to this news publication, managed Tetras Capital with partners Brendan Bernstein and Thomas Garrambone.  Bernstein and Garrambone have worked as analysts for a number of investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Torreya Partners.
