42425367,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwF1h,1390860146,Ten People You Meet in Bitcoin,"Last month, over 600 people congregated in Las Vegas for the Inside Bitcoins conference, including yours truly. The critical mass of bitcoin pioneers and thought leaders was stunning, and I wrote about the top ten movers and shakers I had the chance to meet in person.  This past weekend, nearly twice as many people attended the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, and the attendees continued to wow me with their enthusiasm, creativity, and raw intelligence.  As I flew back to Boston, I realized that the conference’s palpable energy stemmed just as much from the quality of the 'average' attendees as it did from the high-profile presenters and exhibitors.  Forget celebrities; let's talk about ten who represent the 'average' people you will meet in bitcoin.  Early adopters  I arrive in Miami for the pre-conference cocktail party on Friday night, and one of the first people I meet is Charlie. He's 42, but he looks 30, and is as easy-going as they come. We share a few stories before the invariable question of ""How long have you been in bitcoin?"" pops up, and he nonchalantly says that he purchased ""a bunch"" when bitcoin traded for $4.50.  Today, he considers himself retired, travels the world and doesn't worry about a whole heck of a lot.  Incredibly, Charlie is not unique in this crowd. Dozens of paper and actual millionaires, hackers, entrepreneurs, legal experts, miners and journalists mingle at the roof deck party in the Clevelander Hotel in Miami Beach this first night.  It is an eclectic mix of individuals with vastly different backgrounds and interests, but a common passion for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin.  Entrepreneurs and hackers  There's David, an entrepreneur who loves ""beekeeping as much as bitcoin."" He and his seven year old son have made all-natural honey since 2011, which they only sell in exchange for bitcoin. In fact, the whole operation is completely cashless (aside from taxes), as David's packager, web-designer and sugar suppliers are all paid in bitcoin.  Then there's Gary, a man determined to sell his '93 Mercedes Benz 300 CE Convertible at the conference in order to demonstrate how easy, inexpensive and trustless bitcoin transactions can be. I will see him again the very next day grinning from ear-to-ear in front of the conference hall having just successfully auctioned the car for 9.25 BTC.  Finally, there's Kevin, a baby-faced engineer interning for wallet service provider Blockchain. He's won several hacking competitions related to cyber-security and has been thinking about applying for an NSA scholarship to help defray the costs of Penn State, but he's here now because he knows that he too might strike digital gold if he stays in the industry.  Some needed diversity  I am also pleasantly surprised to see that the community is evolving beyond the ""white males club"" many complain about. Although the first person that most attendees see on Friday is a stunning blonde model clad in little more than gold body paint (which certainly annoys some), the other females at the conference aren’t just wives and girlfriends.  The women on the BitPay team are sharp and counter (or let's be honest, correct) the technical criticisms I have of their product.  Rena, the co-founder of New York's MintCombine incubator, talks about bitcoin's likely regulatory path and her motivation for incubating young bitcoin enterprises. And Beth, a former NASA engineer and current Virgin Galactic astronaut trainer who helped assemble the international space station, tells me about her mining rig (""just a few Jupiters"").  Even during conversations with actual 'plus-ones' like one Emily, it's still refreshing to hear someone tease her ""good ole boy"" finance colleagues for not understanding bitcoin and investing in the currency as aggressively as she has.  Our gold-painted greeter, Maili, also becomes a bitcoin convert on Friday night. When one person suggests she try collecting tips in bitcoin, she tells him she will put a QR code on her professional website.  My experience tells me that would be smart. The bitcoin community is as generous as it is passionate.  Benevolence  When I made the last minute decision to attend the conference, I foolishly underestimated how crowded Miami Beach would be during mid-January and struggled to find a hotel room.  [post-quote]  Yet after one blast email and fifteen minutes, I had a host. Jeffrey, a fellow writer, conference presenter, and entrepreneur (his Liberty.me IndieGogo campaign recently eclipsed the $100k mark) splits his hotel room with me for two nights.  We meet for the first time when I knock on his door.  At another point in the conference, I ask Tim, the Bitcoin Seattle meetup organizer, for a stick of gum and extend my hand. Instead of the gum, he hands me a bitcoin-engraved silver coin.  When I explain that I had only meant to ask for some gum, he shrugs and says, ""That's ok. I like your writing. Consider it a tip.""  Driving the future  For every Jeremy Allaire, Brian Armstrong and Barry Silbert, there are ten equally passionate people you don't know like Tim, Rena and David who make the industry so vibrant and exciting. And you may only meet them at large conferences like this one.  They are having so much fun tackling some of the biggest challenges in bitcoin, it is hard to see them abandoning the movement anytime soon. Every single one of them understands how risky bitcoin is, but they see today's risks as tomorrow's opportunities.  They are certain that the community will persevere through any hiccups and produce new crops of Allaires, Armstrongs and Silberts. They just aren't worried about a whole heck of a lot.

Shrem and 'BTCKing' are accused, by the Manhattan US Attorney, the DEA and other federal agencies, of engaging in a ""scheme to sell"" $1m of bitcoin to Silk Road users.  Ross William Ulbricht, the 29-year-old alleged mastermind behind the Road, has not yet been tried.  He was arrested for violating the narcotics laws of the United States, possessing and distributing controlled substances and committing or conspiring to commit computer hacking offences and money laundering offences.  Ulbricht also allegedly, “solicited a Silk Road user to execute a murder-for-hire of another Silk Road user, who was threatening to release the identities of thousands of users of the site”.  This timeline is a collection of everything we know about Silk Road so far. There are plenty of conspiracy theories. There are also details which may appear vague or even incongruous.  Whatever revelations come next, they are all just the beginning of a much longer timeline.  The interactive timeline below lets you scroll through the key points in the Silk Road story.

42425356,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEhh,1390845873,Bank of Russia Issues Warning on Digital Currencies,"Recent sub-zero temperatures may have paralysed parts of Eastern Europe, but they haven't done much to slow down the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank.  On Monday, the bank issued a statement on the use of digital currencies. It resembledhttp://www.cbr.ru/press/PR.aspx?file=27012014_1825052.htm similar warnings issued by regulators in Asia and Europe over the past few months, so the pattern is very familiar.  The bank  points out that these currencies aren't backed by a state entity, that they are speculative in nature and that trades are carried out on virtual exchanges are ""high risk"". The statement goes on to warn citizens and businesses, especially financial institutions, about the risks associated with digital currencies like bitcoin.  In addition, the bank warns that issuing alternative currencies in the Russian Federation is prohibited:  ""According to Article 27 of the Federal Law 'On the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (Bank of Russia)' issuing monetary surrogates is prohibited in the Russian Federation.""  The central bank also pointed out that the anonymous nature of digital currencies, and the unlimited range of actors who use them, could lead some people to break the law unintentionally, as they could unknowingly aid those who use such currencies for money laundering or even terrorism.  Involvement in such transactions and exchange services will be considered as ""potential involvement in the implementation of suspicious transactions"" in accordance with existing legislation on money laundering, as well as counter terrorism legislation.  The warning will no doubt leave many Russian bitcoin enthusiasts scratching their heads. It comes just days after Sberbank CEO German Gref publicly backed digital currencies in Davos, saying they are an interesting global experiment and that an outright ban would be a ""colossal mistake"".  Sberbank  is owned by the Bank of Russia, which makes the timing of the statement rather odd to say the least – it sounds rather like a case of damage control.

42425357,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEjh,1390843656,BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem Arrested in Silk Road Bitcoin Bust,"Updated 23:40 GMT with comments from Senator Tom Carper & the Winklevoss brothers.  Charlie Shrem, CEO of bitcoin exchange service BitInstant, has been arrested for his alleged involvement in a scheme to ""sell and launder over $1m in bitcoins"" through the now defunct online black market Silk Road.  According to a document published by the Manhattan US Attorney, charges have also been filed against Robert M. Faiella, a 52-year-old Florida native better known as ""BTCKing"". Both Shrem and Faiella have been charged with conspiring to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, among other individual charges.  If convicted, Faiella and Shrem face maximum prison sentences of 25 years and 30 years, respectively. The case is being handled by the Office’s Complex Frauds Unit, and Assistant US Attorney Serrin Turner is in charge of the prosecution.  Official reactions  Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara issued a statement, reinforcing his office's hardline stance toward the use of virtual currencies to commit crimes, not simply the currency itself:  “Truly innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.""  Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), released a written statement thanking investigators and reminding everyone that law enforcement is ""focused on ensuring that those who want to use digital currencies for harm are stopped.""  He did, however, also add cautiously that bitcoin and digital currency might be beneficial if regulated properly:  ""That being said, there are many who believe that digital currencies are an important and valuable new technology, and who want the opportunity to play by the rules in bringing potentially valuable products to the marketplace. That’s why it’s critical that the federal government, including Congress, takes notice and learns more about the potential promises and risks of this emerging technology and develop thoughtful and sensible policies that protect the public without stifling innovation and economic growth.""  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who had been major investors in BitInstant since 2012, have distanced themselves from Shrem with an emailed statement that they expected management to obey all applicable laws.  ""We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials. We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.""  An overview of the charges  Law enforcement officials allege that from December 2011 to October 2013, Faiella ran an underground bitcoin exchange through the Silk Road website, described as a ""sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar"" where ""every variety"" of illegal drugs was sold.  The release went on to detail why it believes Faiella failed to properly register his exchange as a money transmitting business:  ""The company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash for bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. Faiella obtained bitcoins with the company’s assistance, and then sold the bitcoins to Silk Road users at a markup.""  Further, the statements allege that Shrem was complicit for failing to report Faiella's crimes, as he was legally obligated to do in his position.  The charges state that Shrem ""was fully aware that Silk Road was a drug-trafficking website"", and that he knew Faiella was ""operating a bitcoin exchange service for Silk Road users"". It went on to allege that Shrem had also used the site to purchase drugs, and that correspondences between Shrem and Faiella provide evidence as to this preexisting knowledge.  ""Shrem knowingly allowed Faiella to use the company’s services to buy bitcoins for his Silk Road customers; personally processed Faiella's orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity report with the United States Treasury Department about Faiella’s illicit activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the company’s Compliance Officer.""  Charlie Shrem, a rising star    The announcement follows the news that Shrem was pulled last minute at this weekend's North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami, Florida. His talk was replaced by an economics panel, but no official explanation for the change was given at the time.      Shrem is a high-profile member of the bitcoin community, serving not only as CEO of BitInstant, the New York-based bitcoin exchange that garnered a $1.5m investment from Wiklevoss Capital, but as vice chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation.      Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss issued a statement following Shrem's arrest, indicating that when they extended capital to the firm, it was with the understanding that its management would abide by anti-money laundering laws.      ""Although BitInstant is not named in today’s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest. We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials.""              The 24-year-old graduate of City University of New York-Brooklyn College received a rush of media attention and public interest for his status as a ""bitcoin millionaire"", and has been an outspoken evangelist for bitcoin.    ""Bitcoin is not simply a currency, or a payment system. Bitcoin is a technology that enables you and I to work together to make the world a better place,"" Shrem wrote on December 25.  Despite Shrem's success, however, BitInstant has been plagued by outrage from frustrated users and was even hit with a class-action lawsuit. Shrem has not commented on the allegations publicly or via his official Twitter account.  Silk Road prosecutions continue    Though the arrests may come as a surprise to those who have used the anonymous networks, researchers have indicated that tracing individual bitcoins to specific exchanges is possible, and as such, would lead to more arrests in cases like Silk Road.      Sarah Meiklejohn, author of the paper, “A Fistful of Bitcoins: Characterizing Payments Among Men With No Names,"" noted in December that such actions would even be ""easy"" for law enforcement officials.      ""The FBI now has all the data for Silk Road, they can see how much these guys earned, and they can see the addresses they used. So, it really seems like they have a lot of what they need to be able to prosecute them,"" Meiklejohn told CoinDesk.    The Silk Road website has since been forfeited, and authorities have announced they will look to sell $25m in bitcoin holdings confiscated from the site.  Illegal sales crackdown  The announcement follows the increased scrutiny of US citizens who are using bitcoin black markets for illicit and illegal transactions.  On 18th January, a Florida man was arrested for selling a deadly toxin to police officers through the bitcoin black market Black Market Reloaded. Similarly, earlier this month, another black market use was arrested for shipping a legal firearm to international authorities.

42425355,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwEfh,1390840242,Major UK Banks Face Backlash After Withdrawal Limits and Delays,"Restrictions on withdrawals, ATM hardware errors, widespread fraud – while these may sound like the kind of problems associated with a burgeoning economic platform, they are in fact issues dominating the headlines of traditional global finance.  In the past week, UK customers have encountered complications withdrawing cash from major banks (including Bank of Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds and TSB) due to contentious policy changes and service interruptions.  On 24th January, it was revealed that HSBC had failed to inform customers of a policy change implemented in November that would require consumers to submit ""evidence"" to complete cash withdrawals of £5,000 to £10,000.  The revelation caused widespread public outrage among privacy and alternative currency advocates who view the development as symptomatic of the increased control banks and financial institutions are exerting over the traditional monetary supply.    .@hsbc_uk_press In light of recent revelations of accounting scandals and Hezbollah money laundering, why should anyone believe you?      — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) January 25, 2014    Similarly, Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Lloyds and TSB customers were affected by the unscheduled shutdown of cash machines and debit cards on 27th January, which representatives claimed was caused by a server failure.  Up to 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours, reports said.  Cash withdrawal restrictions  HSBC's actions were not just concerning to consumers. In the aftermath, major banks also moved to distance their brands from such restrictions, clarifying their policies on large cash withdrawals.  None indicated that they would require evidence to authorize this action, though all stated that they still reserve the right to ask questions about large withdrawals as a consumer protection precaution.  Yet, while the consumer protection angle was a favoured explanation by banks, certain consumers saw it very differently. Stephen Cotton, the HSBC customer whose story incited the maelstorm, got to the heart of the issue in press statements made after he was denied both £5,000 and £4,000 withdrawals. Cotton said:  ""You shouldn't have to explain to your bank why you want that money. It's not theirs, it's yours.""  Cotton has been banking with HSBC for 28 years, and had previously received indications from phone support that he could make such a withdrawal. Following the backlash, the bank quickly moved to change its guidance to employees, instructing them to make clear that providing such information is not mandatory.  Speaking on the policy, HSBC said:  ""Cash presents more risk, and in particular financial crime risk, than other payment methods. It also leaves customers with very little protection if things go wrong.""  ""Therefore, we need to monitor particularly closely movements of cash in and out of the banking system. This is why we ask our customers about the purpose of large cash withdrawals when they are unusual and out of keeping with the normal running of their account.""  ATM issues continue  The problems encountered by the Bank of Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds and TSB ATMs may have been less notable, if only because a string of IT problems have plagued UK banks in recent years. Though, in the case of these banks, actions to resolve the issues were greeted more positively.  Paul Pester, CEO of TSB, took to Twitter to personally apologise for the outage, and to deal with real-time customer concerns.    My apologies to TSB customers having problems with their cards. I'm working hard with my team now to try to fix the problems. PDP      — Paul Pester | (@PaulPester) January 26, 2014    Pester updated customers as to when the problem was fixed, responded to a consumer suggestion by updating its automated telephone messages and apologized to frustrated customers who reported point-of-sale disturbances and call centre issues.    @Hardbyte sorry Craig. At one point we had 300 customers queuing to speak to the call centre - sorry if you couldn't get through. PDP      — Paul Pester | (@PaulPester) January 26, 2014    A call to action  In the ensuing unrest, the virtual currency community has used the issue at hand to illuminate those who are dissatisfied with the current state of the banking industry, yet uninformed about available alternatives.  Separate reddit threads have since emerged, with some garnering more than 200 comments spanning a wide range of topics.  Evan Rose, president and CEO of BitcoinATM, spoke to CoinDesk about how his industry can learn from such issues. Rose noted that although the bitcoin ATM industry isn't immune from the issues experienced by these banks, it does benefit from ""a clean design slate"". He said:  ""Whereas much of the infrastructure surrounding traditional ATM networks is grounded in technology 20+ years old, we took the opportunity to build our service from the ground up with absolute redundancy and availability in mind.""  ""Much of the bitcoin ecosystem is being built in a similar manner, which has the potential to give bitcoin companies a leg up over the traditional services customers are accustomed to.""

42425370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwF9h,1390833655,"Derivatives, Futures and Protecting Against Bitcoin's Risks","Many companies and individuals are banking on bitcoin's long-term prospects, hoping that the currency's value will continue to rise.  According to a recent CoinDesk poll, 56% of bitcoiners think that the price of one BTC will reach $10,000 in 2014.  But wait - hasn’t it been made crystal clear that bitcoin is volatile? Isn’t it true that exchanges have vastly differing prices? How can investors avoid the hazardous and risky attributes of bitcoin?  Ways to protect value for those holding bitcoin (without exchanging it for fiat) must emerge. Hedging, a common financial procedure used in traditional markets, is one such method that can help individuals and companies maintain value if bitcoin’s price drops.  Hedging is used to counter against fluctuations, something that bitcoin investors are acutely aware of.  Bitcoin derivatives  Derivatives are instruments that allow investors to trade in something indirectly. As the name implies, they are “derived” units of value.  As such, derivatives are predicated on the idea that you can manipulate your position towards a security (eg a stock, a bond – or a bitcoin).  Singapore-based BTC.sx is currently the most popular platform for doing this. In November, BTC.sx reported over 2,000 registered users. A recent press release announced that the company had since brokered over $35m in transactions.  The company’s interface is simplistic, offering users only two buttons: 'long' for when investors think bitcoin will go up, 'short' for when the value will go down. But the UI probably belies the type of person that will really use BTC.sx.  “Those who use our platform are pretty sophisticated investors,” said George Samman, the chief operating officer of BTC.sx.  “We are a 24/7 operation where you can hedge at spot at all times as this volatile markets price constantly changes.”  Investors should be sophisticated: BTC.sx allows its customers to trade on margin.  This means users can place leveraged bets on the platform: “Customers on BTC.sx are able to go long or short on bitcoin with our platform. We offer 10x margin on their bitcoin,” said Samman.  It’s proving to be popular, and Samman says that the company really saw a huge spike in interest in the latter part of 2013. “We really started to see more interest in BTC.sx around October, when the price went from $200 to $1,200,” he said.  The company is now raising money to expand its operations.  Futures  Futures can be used as a long-term bet that something will rise or fall. This is slightly different to what BTC.sx is doing. At first, being locked into something long-term, like a contract, might not make immediate sense.  Unless you’ve invested a ton of money in something bitcoin-related, that is. Mining would be a good example of this.  The Russia-based exchange ICBIT, a site that’s been in operation for over two years, sells millions of futures contacts a month. Futures on ICBIT for March alone total over 2.4m in contracts. ICBIT makes money in this just like an exchange; they reap fees from every transaction.  One futures contract on ICBIT is worth $10. In order to cover $100,000 worth of bitcoin, for example, an investor would have to buy contracts worth $1,000 on ICBIT's exchange.  The company told CoinDesk that some traders hedge bitcoin values up to $1m and that vast majority of their business comes from US customers.  If you are a big-time bitcoin miner, it makes sense to hedge the risk that lies ahead. Things like rising electricity costs, hardware obsolescence and dropping BTC valuations could be problematic for miners.  Although they are also known as being speculative bets, farmers are often commonly associated with futures. Farming can be risky – just look at the drought conditions in California. This is similar to what bitcoin miners are doing – hedging against the unknown.  The fact that ICBIT's biggest attraction has been bitcoin, while other cryptocurrecies like litecoin do not have a big market, suggests that mining could be one of the biggest targets for these types of contracts.  Alternatives  New ways of reducing risk are coming. PawnCoin is a company that will give individual investors the ability to unlock a portion of bitcoin holdings. That company has said it will take on the risks of volatility while providing its customers with fiat liquidity.  New York-based bitcoin trading platform Coinsetter has been raising money to offer financial instruments in the future.  When asked about risk management products, Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of Coinsetter, said:  “Our legal team has spent considerable time formulating our regulatory strategy around offering futures and options to US institutions. We have a market making partnership lined up, and I believe we will be able to release a platform for it this year.”  Another alternative which may have less risk involved than futures or derivatives is insurance.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was originally formed in the United States to ensure that bank deposits were safe in the event of financial turmoil; other countries have a form of this as well to protect from cataclysmic events. A recent American Banker article discusses this idea for bitcoin.  And companies like Elliptic are doing this in an unregulated way right now, using insurer Lloyd's of London to protect its deep cold storage wallets. But unlike hedging against volatility risk, Elliptic's solution only protects investors in the event that a wallet is stolen.  Conclusion  Predicting the movement of bitcoin can seem like a completely implausible undertaking. But with derivatives and futures contracts, there is opportunity for sophisticated investors to profit, or at least cover their risks.  This is something that institutional investors and proprietary traders already use in financial markets to reduce the chance of loss. Insurance could also come into play at some point as bitcoin becomes a more popular financial asset.  Barry Silbert of SecondMarket and the Bitcoin Investment Trust has said that Wall Street is planning to invest in bitcoin during 2014. Some of these methods will certainly play a part in the ways that a growing collective of cryptocurrency investors will try to mitigate their risks.  When Wall Street comes knocking, bitcoin will need these types of products in order to properly apply institutional risk management techniques.

42425371,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwExh,1390825934,App.net Debuts Crowdfunding Platform for Bitcoin,"Social application network App.net has announced a new platform, Backer, that will allow software companies to raise funding for new features using bitcoin.      Developers can accept payments for projects via credit card, bitcoin or both. Additionally, open-source projects can use the site fee-free.    App.net  sees Backer as a way to allow companies to invest in new services (inlcuding bitcoin acceptance) without financial risk, by having customers contribute to the cost of their development.    Introducing Backer: Crowdfunding for Features -> https://t.co/0yY2K4zWVL      — App.net (@AppDotNet) January 25, 2014      The feature marks the latest release for App.net, which offers a variety of applications - from microblogging clients to photo sharing services - which, unlike major alternatives, are run by subscription payments, not advertisements.    App.net's bitcoin experiment    The idea for Backer was born when App.net asked customers if they would pay in bitcoin for its services. Before taking the leap, however, App.net was unable to find any crowdfunding tools that would allow a software business to raise funds for a feature like this.      Rival platform Kickstarter, for example, prohibits software projects in its guidelines.      ""The impetus for us building and launching this now was that we were trying to figure out whether or not to accept bitcoin for App.net subscriptions, and every single other startup founder I asked said they were wondering the same thing. If you survey the current tools available, there are none that would work for this. When I asked other founders if they would use something like Backer to decide whether or not they should accept Bitcoin they said 'yes'.""            App.net's proposal    Under App.net's proposal, a one-year subscription to its service would cost 0.036 BTC ($31.56 at press time); a yearly developer account subscription would cost 0.1 BTC ($87.65); and a bundle of 10 member accounts could cost 0.3 BTC ($263.31).      Should the crowdfunding campaign raise 40 BTC ($35,099), App.net pledges that it will add the option for developers to receive payments from App.net in bitcoin.      ""If App.net is able to reach this goal, we will have an incentive to hold the bitcoin we receive from subscription fees to pay out Developer Incentive Program payments, rather than immediately converting the bitcoin we receive back to USD. This means that a portion of our business will run directly using bitcoin,"" the company wrote.              With 25 days remaining, that crowdfunding campaign has raised 5.6 BTC toward its 10 BTC goal.    Bitcoin crowdfunding    App.net, however, is not the first crowdfunding platform to accept bitcoin. Last October, Australia-based Pozible announced its decision to accept bitcoin in order to capitalize on the low costs of virtual currency transactions. Similarly, the Argentina-based site Idea.me started a bitcoin funding platform for art, music and retail projects back in December.      Of course, the burgeoning space also includes more bitcoin-specific crowdfunding platforms. CoinFunder was launched in March with the goal to allow users to post projects and bounties that could be funded by communities. BitcoinStarter followed soon after in April, though it has received criticism for its model.      While novel, bitcoin crowdfunding services still face an uncertain regulatory environment, one made all the more murky by the lack of legal clarifications for crowdfunding services.

42425353,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwBLh,1390822256,"Miami Bitcoin Conference Day 2: Litecoin, New Coins and Regulatory Risks","Day Two of the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami was packed full of speakers and panels.  The two halls at the Miami Beach Convention Center kept attendees on the move. In the promenade areas, a number of bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related businesses were showing off their product and services.  In turn, the Miami Beach area served as a vacation-like backdrop for the event, with parties held on the rooftop of the Clevelander Hotel on both Friday and Saturday night.  Even so, the conference schedule of the second day seemed to move at a frenetic pace, with few breaks in between. Here are some of the highlights.  Litecoin  One of the most popular speakers during Day Two of Bitcoin Miami was Charlie Lee. Though Lee now works at Coinbase, he was responsible for the creation of litecoin, which he named the “lite” version of bitcoin.  “Some people call me Satoshi Lite,” he joked to the audience.  While working at Google, he says that his litecoin project was “an excuse to learn the bitcoin code”. He had faith that he ""could launch a coin that was better” than other alternative cryptocurrencies.  Lee said that building the currency upon the bitcoin's source code has allowed litecoin to adopt bug fixes and other updates to keep it relevant and grow its popularity.  In addition to having a different proof-of-work than bitcoin, Lee pointed out that litecoin has 4x the transaction speed and 4x the total coins of bitcoin. Litecoin has reached a $1bn market cap and a 300x increase in price, according to Lee.  He believes that litecoin could be a payment alternative to bitcoin just like there are different types of credit cards. Merchants will likely “accept bitcoin and litecoin just like merchants now accept Visa or American Express,” he said.  And Lee is optimistic about litecoin's future in light of ASIC mining coming to the market sometime soon, he said: “ASIC is not as scary as people think”. Lee was keen to add that there are currently “no plans” for litecoin to be implemented with Coinbase, but that it's only a “matter of time” before this will happen.  New coins on the block  There were mixed opinions on the potential of alternative cryptocurrencies, a much-discussed topic during the second day of the Miami conference.  In the morning, developer Vitalik Buterin introduced his new cryptocurrency platform Ethereum. Buterin told the audience that there are “serious scalability issues,” when building on top of bitcoin. “Bitcoin was never designed for TCP/IP,” he said. Buterin likened bitcoin to SMTP, the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for email systems that is a protocol built on top of TCP/IP.  Since Vitalik's belief is that bitcoin was ""not designed as a foundational layer”, he conceived Ethereum, a platform that works upon the concept of contracts that act as an automated agent.  He also said that Enthereum has a more powerful scripting language for developers compared to bitcoin. One of the uses for Ethereum, he said, was to build sub-currencies for very specialised purposes.  “Let’s not have one currency. Let’s have 1,000s of currencies,” said Buterin.  Not every speaker at the conference was overly positive on the concept of the growing number of alternative cryptocurrencies. Angel Investor Brock Pierce said during his talk that altcoin ""fragmentation"" could be a concern for bitcoin's growth potential going forward. Yet he remained positive about bitcoin's price in the future.  “We’ll see a $5,000 bitcoin in 2014, perhaps $10,000,” he said.  Regulators  There is a degree of uncertainty towards what policymakers will do in regards to decentralised currency regulation. As a result, compliance-related topics are always a popular at events like these. This was made crystal clear during the regulation panel during Day Two.  The panel consisted of Carol van Cleef a partner at Patton Boggs LLP; Jacob Farber, senior counsel at Perkins Coie; David Aylor, a Silk Road-representative criminal defense lawyer; and Gabriel Caballero, an associate at Gunster Law. The session was moderated by Paul Buitink.  “The SEC has been relatively quiet,” said Caballero, who made the point that the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) will likely have a big role in securing cryptocurrencies. That particular process will allow investors to have better access to of bitcoin, but will definitely draw scrutiny from the SEC.  Caballero believes that the unique nature of distributed money means different government organisations will have to be involved and must collaborate in order to enact cohesive policies. “When you say ‘regulate bitcoin’, that is a very broad statement,” he said.  The law firm Perkins Coie is currently representing a number of bitcoin-related startups. Senior counsel Jacob Farber believes that compliance issues will have to be taken care of at some point.  ""We have to assume that this will be a problem that solves itself,"" said Farber.  The future and closing remarks  “This industry is moving at light speed,” Nicolas Cary, the CEO of hosted wallet Blockchain.info, remarked during his session at the end of Day Two.  Cary announced that developer and bitcoin advocate Andreas Antonopoulos is joining the Blockchain.info team. One of the things that Antonopoulos will likely be working on are technical security elements such as multisignature transactions. “Multisig is definitely on our radar,” Cary told the audience.  The company already has amassed 1.4 million users, according to a spokesperson. Cary said that the future success of bitcoin adoption will have to do with developers building accessible applications.  “We need you to build beautiful and simple products to make bitcoin fun,"" he implored the audience.  Cary was the last speaker at the conference before closing remarks were made. The conference schedule concluded with organiser Moe Levin, who talked about the impressive attendance numbers. “We expected 500, we got 1,200. A lot of the ticket sales happened just two days ago,” he said.  The North American Bitcoin Conference was, in the end, an opportunity for attendees to learn new things about cryptocurrencies and network with like-minded enthusiasts. In those respects, it did not disappoint.  The fact that it was held over a weekend in Miami, where temperatures averaged a comfortable 70 degrees, certainly helped.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | LTC | REGULATION,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/01/27/miami-bitcoin-conference-day-2-litecoin-new-coins-and-regulatory-risks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/89660c0c0fd1d004126a7f96c0213064d8c0ab62-1292x706.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425335,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHwAth,1390818639,"Jeremy Allaire: Regulators, Wall Street and Bitcoin Hitting the Mainstream","Last year, bitcoin was nothing more than funny-money criminals used to buy drugs and weapons. Well, that was the story that dominated mainstream coverage of the digital currency.  No longer. The world-changing potential of this decentralised method of digitally transferring ownership is being discussed in serious, if inflammatory, terms everywhere from the US Senate to Chinese state television.  But to make this transition, bitcoin is having to change. No longer the preserve of radical libertarians, bitcoin is beginning to be dominated by a different kind of animal: the suited businessman.  And with Wall Street-types not far behind, the anti-government ideals held by certain parts of the bitcoin community are being rejected and disowned. Bitcoin is beginning to hit the mainstream, but it’s tidying itself up first.    Why banks fear bitcoin    Jeremy Allaire, who founded the bitcoin payments company Circle, which raised $9m in venture capital funding and is due to launch later this year, is one of the people arguing that bitcoiners should work with governments to establish regulations for bitcoin.  “If your goals are to create a sort of shadow financial system that runs in offshore jurisdictions and is attractive for anarchists and criminals, then maybe [regulation] is not important,” he told CoinDesk on a recent visit to London.  But if your goal is to ensure widespread adoption of bitcoin, there needs to be rules around its use, he says, arguing that it’s not good enough to imagine bitcoin can exist above society:  “A lot of the safeguards that businesses and consumers take for granted in their everyday interactions and payments don’t exist in bitcoin, so [...] how do we understand those risks? How do we address those risks? That’s actually going to be the path forward, not saying, ‘well bitcoin is superior to all things, it’s going to undermine all of these things.’”  Allaire is blunt about the transition bitcoin is going through, saying it’s “absolutely” moving away from its libertarian roots.  He defends governments for issuing warnings about the risks of using bitcoin – “I think these are people who are doing their jobs and calling a spade a spade” – and has little time for people who harbour conspiracy theories about why banks have been unwilling to engage with bitcoin businesses.  It’s not because they’re worried about losing the fees they charge on transactions, he says: “They’re not even thinking that far out. It’s more because they don’t want to go to jail.”    The suits are coming    Government regulation  in the bitcoin space will give banks the confidence to start working with bitcoin businesses, says Allaire. But that’s not the only important change that needs to occur so that bitcoin can enter the mainstream: bitcoin needs Wall Street.  The birth of bitcoin has been tied by some to the economic crash that began in 2007. With the reputation of the financial sector ruined, a new currency that bypassed the banks always had a good chance of being a winner.  The idea that Wall Street may have a role to play in bitcoin’s development is “heresy” to certain members of the community, admits Allaire. However, if bitcoin trading is to develop, it needs Wall Street’s input.  “What I’ve found is that there are so many really talented and smart people in that industry that want to get into this industry. They see what its potential is,” he says.  “You’re going to see an injection of Wall Street knowledge-based skill sets, technical sets, coming into this space, that ultimately will benefit everyone because it will create products from a trade perspective that are more mature.”  Allaire’s vision is that bitcoin will be as easy to use, and as widespread, as the financial services we take for granted today, as physical cash even. That’s not to say he sees bitcoin as merely a like-for-like replacement for our current financial systems.  He talks about “unifying the world more deeply on a common internet-based monetary system” and says that privacy is a “critical ideal that needs to be held up.” However, in its current form, the currency doesn’t appeal to enough people.    Widespread appeal    “The users of bitcoin, I hate to say it, they’re men aged 25-40. Typically, they’re hi-tech focused people; that’s not the whole world,” he says.  “To the average consumer, for them to put their money in this and feel like that money is secure and no-one can steal it, requires some rules around how does that get stored.”  De-risking bitcoin won’t just involve government rules – there are technical and business innovations that will make bitcoin more palatable to ordinary people, Allaire says.  His outspoken belief that bitcoiners should embrace rather than resist the involvement of governments runs counter to the ideology held by many of the people that first flocked to bitcoin, and he admits as much.  But he’s relaxed about moving bitcoin in a direction that some may consider antithetical to its origins:  “A lot of significant technical inventions, including a lot of inventions on the internet, were created with different goals or different expectations around their use, and those really evolved in unpredictable ways.”  Bitcoin is no different. It’s changing, evolving in a way that could allow it to dominate the financial arena. But it won’t destroy the system, it will simply become another part of it.
