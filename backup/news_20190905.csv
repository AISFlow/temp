Speaking on CNBC’s The Squawk Box this morning concerning emerging markets and safe-haven asset classes, Mobius said cryptocurrencies, like fiat, are backed by faith and only hold utility as far as others are willing to use them.  “The bottom line is there is a whole generation of people who have faith in the internet, they have faith in these cryptocurrencies…the degree to which a cryptocurrency can enable you to buy something and you believe that to be the case, then that’s fine.”  Mobius said a gold-backed cryptocurrency run on the blockchain would be of interest, however. “If there is a cryptocurrency that is really backed by gold and there is a meaningful agreement and some kind of modern thing connection, then this could be quite interesting,” he said.  On blockchain, the investor remains skeptical. Mobius said the underlying technology itself remains open to attacks.  “I believe blockchain is a very high-risk situation . . . anything that’s created by man can be broken into . . . and it could create a big crises, so I think we have to be very careful with blockchain.”  The statements follow the stablecoin issuer Paxos' announcement of a gold-backed cryptocurrency earlier today.

The delivery agent, WinLNK.Agent.gen, has been active since 2011 but now its payload is a bit more lucrative for the folks who spread it.  The malware masquerades as a book or essay packed in an executable file which allows the hacker's command-and-control system to send other pieces of malware, including cryptominers and spam delivery systems, onto an infected computer. How do we know the malware is targeting students? Kaspersky watched its logs and saw ""233,000 cases"" of malicious essays and ""122,000 attacks by malware that was disguised as textbooks.""  ""More than 30,000 users tried to open these files [this year],"" they wrote.  Downloading out-of-copyright ebooks and library books is quite simple and safe so this malware targets harder-to-find textbooks. Our own quick Google search found a number of ebook versions of various beginning college texts that cost $150 or more online. While most of them were PDFs, there were a number of executable files that were flagged as malware.  Far more pernicious, interestingly, are the ads masquerading as download links that send you to malware sites rather than the correct PDF or ePub file.

Nor does it mention Calibra, the Facebook subsidiary developing a wallet for the currency.  However, Libra's stated goals include bringing financial services to underserved people in the developing world, and more specifically, enabling money transfers over WhatsApp.  WhatsApp declined to comment.  The position would be in London or Johannesburg with significant travel time and calls for someone with expertise in blockchain, digital identity and cryptocurrency.

Calibra is also building out a compliance team including a sanctions lead, head of compliance and head of fraud.

42382616,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOoN,1567696514,Vanbex Sells IP Amid Criminal Probe Into $22 Million ICO,"Vanbex, a Canadian blockchain company mired in a criminal investigation and several lawsuits, has sold its intellectual property to Toronto-based crypto brokerage Hyperion for an undisclosed price.  ""This acquisition allows the value of the products and the business models they represent to continue under Hyperion’s banner,"" Lisa Cheng, co-founder of Vanbex, said in a press release issued Wednesday  Acquiring Vanbex's tokenization and tax products ""was a strategic move enabling us to focus on a larger market share,” said Michael Zavet, CEO of Hyperion, in the release.  The FUEL token, which Vanbex issued in the initial coin offering (ICO) at the center of the investigation, will still be used ""to pay for transaction fees, API integrations, and services provided in the digital asset ecosystem between Hyperion and the Vanbex blockchain technology products,"" Vanbex stated.  The announcement didn't seem to fully assure some investors in Vanbex's Telegram group, who asked CEO Kevin Hobbs about the token's fate. One said he was ""hoping there is something legally binding in the agreement"" requiring Hyperion to continue accepting FUEL.  Neither Vanbex nor Hyperion responded to requests for comment.  Vanbex will now operate as a blockchain consulting company ""with a focus on supporting Hyperion’s growth from its offices in Vancouver,"" the release said.  Moving out  Vanbex disclosed that it was in talks to sell its assets months ago.  A corporate update posted on Vanbex's website June 25 said the company planned to move its tech products to a new company, ""removing all the negativity surrounding Vanbex and its founders.""  According to the post, Cheng would become CEO of the new company, and Hobbs would stay with Vanbex and its consulting arm to keep fighting for its reputation.  In an ask-me-anything (AMA) session that day with FUEL token holders on Telegram, Hobbs clarified that the ""new company"" was an existing firm negotiating to buy the IP.  It is unclear whether that entity was Hyperion or another party, and this week's announcement says nothing about Cheng joining the acquirer.  The investigation  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) began investigating Vanbex in May 2018. Soon after, the Canadian Revenue Agency began a tax probe.  Canadian authorities froze the bank accounts of Hobbs and Cheng and seized their property in March of this year. The Director of Civil Forfeitures claimed Vanbex's founders misappropriated the $22 million raised in the 2017 ICO and failed to deliver the product promised to investors.  Vanbex's founders denied all the allegations, saying no evidence has been provided to the court to support them. However, some evidence soon surfaced.  According to records presented by RCMP, Etherparty, one of the companies Hobbs and Cheng operated, received its first ICO pre-sale contribution reported to Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) on Aug. 17, 2017.  Then, from Aug. 21 to Dec. 4, Etherparty and Hobbs received nine transactions worth over $5.5 million from over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk Cumberland. On Dec. 7, Hobbs withdrew over $4.1 million from his personal accounts at Cumberland, the document says, and on the next day, Hobbs and Cheng purchased a condominium for that same amount in cash.  According to a July 19 ruling by Supreme Court of British Columbia judge Elliott M. Myers, the investigators demonstrated that Hobbs and Cheng sold $5.5 million worth of bitcoin right before going on a spending spree.  Not buying it  Vanbex argued in a court filing that the director of civil forfeitures hadn't proved Hobbs' and Cheng's wealth boost was a result of the ICO; rather, it could be Hobbs' gambling winnings.  ""Hobbs recorded nearly $60,000 per month in winnings from casinos alone,"" the document states.  However, the police were not convinced, according to Judge Myers:  ""The RCMP investigator deposes that Mr. Hobbs apparently had no substantial wealth or assets prior to the ICO. As of September 29, 2017 Mr. Hobbs had only CDN$15,122.99 in his personal bank accounts. Ms. Cheng does not appear to have any active personal Canadian bank accounts. Mr. Hobbs lives in a residence owned by Ms. Cheng's parents.""  Neither was the judge, who added: ""Mr. Hobbs's winnings can in no way explain the amount of the property purchased by him and Cheng.""  The court left Vanbex founders' property under arrest. The investigation is ongoing.  Investor lawsuit  In the meantime, the company was hit by a new legal challenge: two investors filed a lawsuit to the Supreme Court of British Columbia, saying Hobbs and Cheng violated Canada's securities law by failing to register their ICO as a security offering, and that they misled investors about the state of their business.  Plaintiffs Andrew Beck and Craig Petersen claim they purchased $30,000 worth of FUEL each and now can't sell the tokens, which fell considerably in price.  Hobbs told CoinDesk the lawsuit is ""another attempt to blackmail"" the company, blaming a former employee, Kip Warner, who reported Vanbex to the Canadian police.  Vanbex is now suing Warner for defamation.  'I got suspicious'  For his part, Warner said he had trouble getting paid for his work at Vanbex and was surprised by the firm's focus on marketing rather than development.  ""There were no actual engineers, everybody was doing marketing stuff, so I got suspicious,"" he told CoinDesk.  After quitting Vanbex, Warner shared the information with his friend at the Canadian police. Then the police started investigating Vanbex ""independently on their accord,"" Warner said, but Hobbs figured out who started the fire.  ""He sued me because he believes I’m the genesis for his downfall,"" Warner said.

The exchange announced Thursday that NYDFS had approved the new offering, which Binance is launching in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company.  The Binance stablecoin will be backed by U.S. dollars on a 1:1 ratio, according to a press release. The offering joins the Paxos Standard and the Gemini Dollar as an NYDFS-approved stablecoin.  At launch, verified Paxos customers will be able to directly purchase BUSD tokens through the company's wallet using either U.S. dollars or PAX, its own stablecoin. Binance users will likewise be able to trade BUSD for bitcoin, binance coin or XRP.  The exchange previously announced its intention to issue stablecoins worldwide as part of its Venus project. Binance has already issued stablecoins pegged to bitcoin (BTCB) and the British pound (BGBP).  In a statement, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (""CZ"") said:  ""We hope to unlock more financial services for the greater blockchain ecosystem through the issuance of BUSD, including more use cases and utility through the power of stable digital assets.""  Not the first  Binance USD is only the latest stablecoin whose reserves are being held by Paxos. The company, which was the first crypto firm to receive a trust charter from NYDFS in 2015 (as the itBit Trust Company), now custodies the dollar reserves for its own Paxos Standard stablecoin and Huobi's HUSD token.  According to the company, Paxos will act as both the custodian and the issuer for BUSD, and will regularly audit the dollar holdings.  Paxos co-founder Rich Teo said in a statement that BUSD would be ""a vital step towards long term stability in global crypto markets."" He added that Paxos' ""stablecoin as a service"" offering allowed Binance to customize the new product for its users.

42382602,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOVV,1567692020,Paxos Launches Gold-Backed Cryptocurrency,"Many bitcoiners are former gold bugs who believe in “hard money,” so one crypto company is hoping digitized gold will attract more traders.  Paxos, the New York-based exchange and stablecoin issuer, just launched a gold-backed crypto asset called Pax Gold (PAXG), with each ethereum-based token encapsulating the legal title to a physical bar of gold stored in the Brink’s London vault. Pax Gold has been approved by the New York Department of Financial Services.  “It’s not a representation of the commodity, it’s actual legal title to it,” Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla told CoinDesk. “This is the exact point of the blockchain, the exact premise, that you can now make [assets] easily moveable and divisible and not be tied to a manual, physical process.”  Each token costs the same as an ounce of gold and can be redeemed for a physical bar at partnering institutions such as Bullion Exchanges in New York. Cascarilla said Paxos will expand its list of global partners from the traditional commodities industry to ensure users can claim real gold even if they’re not in London or New York. Plus, the crypto loan startup SALT now offers PAXG-backed loans as well, available in fiat or stablecoins such as PAX, TrueUSD or USDC.  “We’re going to do more products like this where we are taking real-world assets and putting them on the blockchain,” Cascarilla said.  Still, it remains to be seen whether tokenized gold will appeal to crypto enthusiasts. Messari co-founder Dan McArdle told CoinDesk that assets issued by and custodied with centralized entities don’t rival bitcoin’s role as “digital gold.”  “Bitcoin achieves all of gold's relevant properties, plus a lot more, and is just better gold for the modern era,” McArdle said. “Bitcoin achieves its properties precisely because it has no centralized or federated anchors to the physical world. You simply can't get the trustless/uncensorable properties of bitcoin if some relatively small set of people/entities has to manage physical objects represented on a blockchain.”  Product-market fit  Paxos will need to find an audience of gold traders who are interested in crypto beyond bitcoin, as traditionalists on both sides are wary of tokens.  Bitcoin skeptics like Roy Sebag, founder of the precious metals custodian Goldmoney, don’t believe a self-custodied, relatively fungible cryptocurrency would bring new and compliant use cases to the broader gold market. It still requires a know-your-customer process.  “There’s zero value being added in terms of a decentralized blockchain,” Sebag said. “A closed system that is permissioned would be fine. We’ve already been doing that for five years.”  Indeed, the World Gold Council estimated gold-backed financial products like exchange-traded funds accounted for nearly $100 billion of the global market holdings in 2018. Paxos’ commodities trading platform, Post-Trade, secured a chunk of that pie by processing precious metal trades since July 2018. Now, with Pax Gold, retail investors will be able to participate in a broader range of digital gold trades beyond institutional platforms.  “We’re acting at that gateway, as a trusted holder of the assets, but also has trusted verifier of participants,” Cascarilla said. “Just like our Pax stablecoin, it’s audited.”  For traders who might want to buy gold on-the-go and then pick it up in another location, Cascarilla believes Pax Gold could offer a regulated alternative to physical ownership.  “You can own that gold but you don’t have to pay a custody fee, and you can send it around the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,” he said. “This is a groundbreaking product in the history of gold.”  Paxos CEO Chad Cascarilla image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/05/paxos-launches-gold-backed-cryptocurrency,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42382604,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOZH,1567688450,Paxful Plans to Bring 20 Crypto ATMs to Colombia,"A partnership between two cryptocurrency firms could bring 20 new bitcoin ATMs to cities around Colombia.  The bitcoin exchange, Paxful, and crypto ATM company, CoinLogiq, announced the partnership Sept. 5. By integrating the Paxful kiosk feature with CoinLogiq hardware, users will be able to purchase BTC using cash, credit and online debit transfers.  According to Coinatmradar.com, Colombia already boasts 46 bitcoin ATMs, nearly triple the number of all the other terminals located in South America. Further, Paxful conducted a survey of 1,000 random Colombian internet users, and found that nearly 80 percent of Colombians are open to investing in cryptocurrencies.  There are a number of concerns, however. Colombian regulators have thus far exhibited a hardline stance against cryptocurrencies. In 2017, Colombia's central bank, Banco de la República, decreed crypto does not represent legal tender, while the Superintendencia Financiera (SF) said financial institutions are not authorized to invest, broker, or manage virtual currencies.  Despite these dictates, crypto exchange LocalBitcoins found that transactions made in Colombian pesos spiked 1,200 percent in 2017.  Evidence suggests that demand for crypto in Colombia is at least partially driven by expatriates from neighboring Venezuela. In fact, as previously reported, a cottage industry of crypto exchanges and ATMs has sprouted providing services for Venezuelans to exchange their hyperinflated currency and send remittances back home.  The newly-added ATMs will be placed in shopping centers and other public spots. The machines will allow users to withdraw or deposit cryptocurrencies. Paxful did not respond to a request for comment by press time.  Paxful’s manager for Latin America, Magdiela Rivas, said the partnering firms are also working to place 25 new cryptocurrency ATMs in Peru.

Launched in 2018, Dapix is building a delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS) blockchain to act as the connective tissue between cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges and other applications. The goal is to establish an industry standard across all blockchain platforms for sending and receiving payments in crypto.  “The FIO Protocol is the service layer to the entire blockchain ecosystem,” said David Gold, founder and CEO of Dapix. ""[The goal] is to do for blockchain what HTTP did for the internet.""  So far, 24 different blockchain wallet applications have joined the non-profit arm of this initiative, which is known as the Foundation for Interwallet Operability (FIO) Consortium. In February, Binance’s Trust Wallet joined the FIO Consortium, which already includes non-custodial crypto exchange ShapeShift, ethereum wallet application MyCrypto and the official Bitcoin.com wallet.  Speaking about the joint effort, head of Binance Labs Ella Zhang said:  “We invested in the decentralized FIO Protocol because we believe that it has the ability to be the usability layer for the entire blockchain ecosystem. As a start, the FIO Protocol will work immediately across every blockchain. ... Over time, Binance envisions the open source FIO Protocol becoming a usability standard that every blockchain-related product integrates.”  Joining Binance Labs in the Series A round are crypto investment firms Blockwall Capital, NGC Ventures and LuneX Ventures.  Dapix's Gold highlighted the FIO Protocol is targeted for mainnet launch in the first quarter of next year. For now, Dapix and the 24 members of the FIO Consortium are testing out aspects of the protocol with the FIO Address Presale.  FIO addresses are meant to simplify the complex wallet addresses normally used to send and receive cryptocurrency payments. Unlike most other tools to simplify wallet addresses, the FIO protocol aims to standardize addresses across all blockchain platforms and applications.  “Our primary goal with the FIO Address Presale is not to generate the most income possible; it's to generate engagement with the FIO Protocol,"" Gold said, adding:  ""We want to get as many people to reserve a FIO domain in advance so they’re ready to use it with their FIO-enabled wallet as soon as mainnet goes live.""

42382610,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOfZ,1567688421,US Energy Department Funds Trial of Factom Blockchain to Secure Power Grid,"Factom, one of the earliest companies to pitch blockchains to enterprises, is participating in a U.S. government-funded trial of the technology to protect the national power grid.  Announced Thursday, TFA Labs, an internet-of-things (IoT) security startup, is experimenting with Factom's protocol to validate that devices on the grid aren't infected with malware.  Backed by a nearly $200,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the project aims to improve the security of millions of such devices.  In some cases, TFA Labs is looking at storing raw data, such as the health and status of devices, on the Factom blockchain. In other cases, the company wants to assign a digital identity to the firmware, or permanent software installed on devices. If the files are manipulated, they’ll produce a cryptographic hash that does not match the digital identity, indicating something is amiss.  “We can store raw data or data hashes of the data,” Dennis Bunfield, CEO of TFA Labs, told CoinDesk. “It’s ideal for IoT device use.”  The first phase will last until March when TFA aims to have a prototype for the use case. If the experiment gets to phase two, TFA Labs will collaborate with device manufacturers and could get close to $1 million in funding from the DOE.  Factotum  Factom is separately working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to record camera and sensor data on the blockchain and with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to see if the tech can digitize records of individuals who live in remote parts of the world.  Enterprise users can develop on the startup's protocol using familiar coding languages, said Greg Forst, marketing chair for Factom Protocol.  ""We're data-centric and enterprise-grade whether that's a government or startup or anybody in between,"" Forst said.  Founded in 2014, the Austin, Texas-based company conducted one of the earliest token offerings, raising $1.1 million in 2015 by selling ""factoids.""  However, ""you don't need the factoid token to use the protocol,"" Bunfield said. ""So you never need to touch crypto to use the protocol, making this ideal for use by governments and corporate enterprises.""  Subsequent seed and Series A rounds brought in over $8 million to Factom. An early project recording land titles in Honduras stalled. Factom later introduced a product for the mortgage industry. In July of this year, a nonprofit called the Triall Foundation announced that it was running a clinical trial over Factom.

42382605,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOd3,1567688406,Reid Hoffman's New 'Hamilton'-Inspired Crypto Rap Video Is Straight Fire,"""I myself hold bitcoin,"" Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and a member of the PayPal Mafia, told CoinDesk as he described his reasons for releasing a new hip-hop video about central banks competing against cryptocurrency.  Hoffman's interest in bitcoin goes back years, yet it would be a mistake to lump him in with the burn-traditional-banking-down school of long-time evangelists.  ""I am a pro-government and well-run society guy,"" he said, and yet Hoffman – a partner at VC firm Greylock – also believes a small handful of global cryptocurrencies will arise, inevitably, because they will enable things the world wants and needs.  ""So that's why I have this, to elevate the discourse,"" he told CoinDesk.  The video is a small offering to the online discussion about the future of money in a much catchier format than we usually see. It pits actor-rappers playing Alexander Hamilton (the U.S. Founding Father and first Secretary of the Treasury) against Satoshi Nakamoto (the person (or group) that released the code that powers bitcoin).  https://youtu.be/JaMJi1_1tkA  HODL rhymes  Hoffman was inspired to make the video by watching the musical ""Hamilton.""  He wanted to borrow the didactic rap format to improve the dialogue around an important topic and felt that the fight between traditional banking and decentralized capital made sense.  It's an approach that will be familiar to fans of the YouTube channel Epic Rap Battles of History (ERB), the two main characters go back and forth rhyming out key points supporting each side and taking down the other.  ""As if banks these days still help people make money,"" the emcee playing Nakamoto, YouTuber Timothy DeLaGhetto, spits in response to the necessity of banking. ""The interest in crypto's on rapid ascent. What's your current interest? Like half a percent?""  But the pro-banking side can give as good as it gets.  Epic Rap Battles member EpicLloyd plays Hamilton, with objections to crypto such as, ""Untraceable money, wow, so clever. One typo in your address and it's gone forever.""  Just in case readers aren't familiar with this particular genre, consider checking out Gandhi vs. Martin Luther King, Rasputin vs. Stalin and (this reporter's all time favorite) Eastern Philosophers vs. Western Philosophers.  And indeed this isn't the first time that someone has borrowed the format to make an economic argument. In 2010, economist Russ Roberts teamed up with the group Emergent Order to do a video called ""Fear the Boom and Bust"" about the economics of contemporaries John Maynard Keynes and (crypto favorite) Friedrich Hayek.  Which side are you on?  With regard to this entry in the cannon of historical hip-hop, it's hard not to view the video as pro-crypto.  The video is littered with cameos from the industry's Illuminati, such as Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin; Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, co-founder of Zcash, Lily Liu, co-founder of Earn.com; Elena Nadolinski, founder of Beanstock; Wences Casares, CEO of Xapo; Ben Davenport, co-founder of BitGo and many, many others.  If people say that the video is really just an argument for cryptocurrency, Hoffmann says, ""I think I am OK with them saying that."" But he continued:  ""I do think it's good for the world to have one or more cryptocurrencies, and I think one more of those will be bitcoin or a derivative of it. I think that's a good thing.""  Since his early days in technology, he saw companies come along that helped society work in new and better ways. For example, at PayPal, he saw individuals empowered to accept payments, which paved the way for millions of small businesses.  He saw bitcoin as a chance to offer similar new benefits, such as in emerging markets. He said he thought at the time, ""This could be super important toward helping build society the way it should be.""  But really the underlying message of the video is not so much crypto replacing the banking system, but how the conversation can evolve so that both institutions advance in a way the improves more lives.  Hoffman concluded:  ""What you are really doing is a design goal of how you evolve crypto networks and how you evolve banking systems, so that both are a part of a well-ordered society.""

42382618,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOqt,1567688404,A Bitcoin Treasure Hunt Is Coming to College Campuses This Fall,"The buzzy scavenger hunt for $1 million worth of bitcoin, Satoshi’s Treasure, is coming this fall to nearly two-dozen college campuses worldwide.  The game is operated by a small, mysterious company based on a tropical island (figuring out more about the game itself is part of the appeal) and is sponsored by Primitive Ventures and other prominent investors. Eventually, there will be hundreds of cryptographic keys around the world, shrouded in puzzles and riddles, and the first team to compile 400 of the key fragments will be able to claim the prize.  According to game co-creator Eric Meltzer, over 100,000 people are now on the email list for updates and announcements related to such clues, 40 of which have been released so far.  Now BlockVenture Coalition partners Tyler Wellener and Philip Forte are kicking off a North American campus tour with 20 universities, hosting educational meetups and mini hunts to help students join the game.  “A lot of these students want to learn about blockchain and crypto, but their universities haven’t caught up to them yet,” Wellener told CoinDesk. “We’re looking to provide resources for a lot of these different student groups.”  There will be smaller rewards associated with campus scavenger hunts and self-custody workshops starting mid-September, although organizers are still working out the details.  IDEX CEO Alex Wearn told CoinDesk his exchange will also sponsor some campus workshops focused on bitcoin wallets and decentralized exchanges.  Jonathan Calso, head of the blockchain group at the University of Michigan, told CoinDesk these sponsored meetups benefit the student body by bringing hands-on learning opportunities to campus and giving student clubs like his more credibility among faculty. His college is one of the many Wellener referred to – those that lack courses and official resources related to bitcoin.  “This helps us get more visibility from the engineering department, economics and computer science departments as well,” Calso said, adding:  “The clues incentivize you to discover new websites and tools … to play around with a bitcoin wallet a bit, to see what the technology can do.”  Global networks  Meanwhile, Satoshi’s Treasure co-founder Jessica Wang told CoinDesk she’s helping student groups at several universities in China and Australia get involved with the fall semester campaign, including Shandong University.  “Students are the future of this industry, so we’re going to put small prizes, like one bitcoin, into this game to attract more students,” she said. “We’re going to hide more physical location puzzles globally.”  Wang said that, according to Google Analytics data from the game’s main website, so far roughly 60 percent of traffic comes from the United States and Canada, followed by Russia, France and Indonesia. As such, these custody-focused seminars in North America will also aim to connect students around the world.  “We’re going to have one [key] piece at a university in Asia and another in a university in the U.S. So they’re going to need to network with each other,” Wang said.  Thanks to a small grant from the Tezos Foundation, Satoshi’s Treasure organizers will also hire cryptography experts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, plus external foundations, to keep up with demand for more keys by ramping up the puzzle-making process.  “Top cryptography foundations and teams will create more puzzles on their end,” Wang said. “We want the ecosystem to bring more stakeholders into the game.”  Eugene Leventhal, former head of Carnegie Mellon University’s blockchain club and a current member of the university’s CyLab Security & Privacy Institute, told CoinDesk these seminars and campus scavenger hunts could also help engage a wider range of students. CMU Blockchain Group events typically attracted around 30 students each in 2018, with the highest turnout being roughly 80 students.  “For the humanities side, we hope something like this will be a way to get more students involved,” Leventhal said, adding:  “I’m interested in maximizing the activities and touchpoints for students, so they can get involved.”  Buried bitcoin via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/09/05/a-bitcoin-treasure-hunt-is-coming-to-college-campuses-this-fall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/77ff5c8a1eeca3522087830b9134679efed13ccc-1500x1191.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bailey did not elucidate about the possible uses of the technology Apple might pursue. She had been taking about the future of payments at the CNN event.  With Facebook planning to launch its Libra stablecoin next year, it would be surprising indeed if Apple were not watching crypto. But, Bailey's comments may come as confirmation that more might be going behind the scenes at Apple's Cupertino HQ.  In February, Apple submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that contained rare details about the computing giant’s interest in blockchain tech.  The document indicated that Apple was involved in the drafting of “Blockchain Guidelines” for the Responsible Business Alliance’s Responsible Minerals Initiative and had been working with the RBA's blockchain team.  Elsewhere in the CNN report, Bailey said that in launching Apple Pay, the firm has made it harder for users to tip. The firm is looking at the problem, she indicated.

42382619,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9sOs9,1567681240,Bitcoin Market Turns Indecisive After Price Rally Stalls Around $10.6K,"View  Bitcoin created a ""spinning-top"" candle on Wednesday, pouring cold water over the optimism generated by the triangle breakout witnessed earlier this week.  The spinning top has made today's UTC close pivotal. A close above Wednesday's high of $10,834 is needed for the continuation of the recent rally.  A UTC close below the spinning top's low of $10,378 would shift risk in favor of deeper losses below $10,000.  A bearish daily close shouldn't be ruled out, as the spinning top represents buyer exhaustion.      The bitcoin (BTC) market is looking indecisive, after witnessing a solid two-way business in the last 24 hours. Today's UTC close will likely determine the next move.  The top cryptocurrency by market value picked up a bid at lows below $10,400 around 13:45 UTC on Wednesday and rose above $10,800 at 20:00 UTC, according to Bitstamp data.  Tuesday's high-volume move had set the tone for a test of the bearish lower high of $10,956, as discussed yesterday.  The bullish move, however, ran out of steam at a 15-day high of $10,834 in the U.S. trading hours yesterday and prices fell back at the UTC close at $10,586 – down just $0.30 percent on the day.  Essentially, BTC created a spinning-top candle on Wednesday, which comprises of a small body, representing marginal gains or losses on the day and long wicks, representing two-way price action.  The spinning top is widely considered a sign of indecision in the market place – with neither bulls nor bears being in a commanding position.  In such situations, experienced traders often wait on the sidelines till a strong directional move emerges. So far, BTC has not shown any signs of directional strength – the cryptocurrency is consolidating around $10,600 on Bitstamp.  Daily chart  The spinning-top candle has taken the shine off the triangle breakout witnessed earlier this week and has made today's UTC close pivotal.  A close above the candle's high of $10,834 would imply a continuation of the rally from the recent low of $9,320.  A more reliable indicator of bullish revival would be a UTC close above the lower high of $10,956 created on Aug. 20. A bullish close above $10,956, if confirmed, would open the doors to $12,000.  Meanwhile, a close below the spinning top's low of $10,378 would indicate that the rally from the recent low of $9,320 has ended and the bears have regained control. That could yield a sell-off back to $9,755 (Aug. 22 low).  With the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram reporting bullish conditions (an above-50 reading), observers may feel tempted to predict a bullish daily close.  However, it may be foolish to rule out a bearish close, as the spinning top candle has appeared following a $1,500 rally, and the indecision predominantly represents bullish exhaustion. If the bulls were strong, the spinning top would not have appeared. Hence, a correction could be around the corner.  BTC is also looking heavy on the intraday charts.  Hourly chart  BTC has found acceptance below the bullish trendline, having faced rejection around $10,800 twice in the last 48 hours.  More importantly, a falling channel breakout seen yesterday failed to accelerate the preceding bullish move – a sign of bullish exhaustion. The 50-hour moving average is also beginning to top out (shed bullish bias).  As a result, a pullback to the 100-hour MA, currently at $10,247 cannot be ruled out.

Joo Sang-sik, director of the company's technology arm, CT-AI Labs, made the announcement at the Upbit Developer Conference in Incheon on Sept. 4, according to a report from local media outlet IT Chosun.  Joo said the company is aiming to develop a blockchain network that would allow fans to be more engaged with the entertainment ecosystem by investing in artists' work through cryptocurrencies.  The director provided few specifics about the technology, but said the firm aims to make use of the concepts of both public and private blockchains and is currently talking to potential partners to build the network.  The entertainment business as it stands utilizes inefficient settlement and payment systems – issues that blockchain could help address, Joo said.  SM Entertainment is a force in the K-pop world, which is becoming one of Korea's most important exports. The company was founded in 1995 by Lee Soo-man – sometimes called the President of Culture. Its acts include Girls' Generation, EXO and Red Velvet.  SM Entertainment is listed on the Korean stock exchange and has a market capitalization of roughly $600 million. The firm undertook a management reshuffle recently, as shareholders raised concerns about its finances and some of its business decisions. Its stock price has dropped 43 percent since last November.  SM Entertainment is not the first company to have proposed the use of blockchain tech in the K-pop industry.  In late 2018, a platform called Ko-fun was launched, aimed to allow K-pop-related crypto transactions on a blockchain. The plan was to create coins for individuals acts, such as a BTS Coin.

42403257,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdfLEa,1567656057,"As Crypto Markets Go Cold, Who Will Pay for Open-Source Code?","Formerly a CoinDesk Contributing Editor, Daniel Cawrey is author of the upcoming “Mastering Blockchain” book to be published by O’Reilly Media.      Earlier this year IBM purchased Red Hat, the oft-referred to model for how open source can thrive, for $34 billion.  Long the consultant to enterprises, IBM is going through a transitional period as a business and needs a boost. Red Hat’s open-source software offers IBM the ability to better compete in cloud services offered by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  Why is this important? Red Hat is one of the most name-checked examples of how open-source software can be successful. It is often used as an example of how championing open source can lead to business success. This is particularly pertinent to the cryptocurrency ecosystem, where open-source ethos rule the technology.  But, something is being lost in this conversation. Namely, open source requires funding for developers to contribute.  Despite what some may think, open source isn’t free. That’s a problematic proposition in the rollercoaster markets that make up open blockchains.  The Volume Issue  Crypto can enable almost ridiculous levels of transparency and control.  Yet in order for it to move forward, incentives must be aligned. Scaling technologies and design experiences must make cryptocurrency easier to use. However, most cryptocurrencies are used primarily for speculation. And the speculative market is in the doldrums, with low levels of volume.  BTC trading volume is at one of the lowest points it has been over the last two years. Source: Bitcoinity  I wrote about this issue years ago, discussing the existential threat facing bitcoin. This was during the 2015-2016 bear market when Bitcoin Core was really the only group working on the protocol. Not long after my piece was published on CoinDesk, an MIT initiative providing $900,000 worth of funding for bitcoin development was announced.  This isn’t to say markets are the single unifying force in crypto, but it’s important to recognize the significance. Augur seems to be an example of this as news comes out about that project seems to affect price. Augur went up as its 2018 launch approached. Yet as volumes hit $1 million and an assassination market developed the price began to decline.  Augur is an interesting project funded directly by crypto via its own token. But Augur depends on other projects to use its network in an open source fashion. When a trader’s market depends on that, it’s an issue.  Veil, which relied on Augur’s protocol, closed up recently. It is an example of this and how the market perspective can impact things. Less trading means less interest in projects like prediction markets.  Zcash and Litecoin  Zcash and Litecoin are experiencing difficulties funding development and other expenses. Both projects have indicated it is the market causing these issues.  The Litecoin Foundation’s finances are in the red. Founder Charlie Lee seemingly is just funding it at this point. Blame for this has been put on crypto’s bear market, which shows projects are more influenced by trading than most in the ecosystem realize.  “The goal, of course, is to get Litecoin Foundation to be self-sustaining from donations, partnerships and merchandise sales,” Lee said. “Until we get to that point, I have and will continue to support the Litecoin Foundation financially as necessary.”  Litecoin isn’t much different than bitcoin, although they did experiment with things like SegWit before BTC implementation. Yet the litecoin community clearly doesn’t see a reason to put forth money to keep the Litecoin Foundation operational.  Zcash can be considered differentiated from both bitcoin and litecoin with increased privacy features. Zcash’s shielding technology is indeed novel, though only a small number of transactions are shielded.  The black line represents unshielded transactions, while the blue line indicates shielded Zcash transactions. Source: Zchain  Is there a community in need of zcash and its privacy protections? Time will tell, although from a trading perspective banks seem to have issues with it. And example of this is when Coinbase UK dropped the asset in Europe likely due to banking pressure.  “I opted for the initial Dev Fund to sunset itself, so that in the future, if Zcash were a success and a community were to grow up to support it, that community would have to collectively decide what to do next,” said Electric Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox.  Time will tell how much support Zcash will get.  Where Funding Comes From  “I think things have improved greatly in terms of the breadth of different funders.… We’ve had an explosion in people that want to fund open source work in the space,” Matt Corallo told CoinDesk recently after joining Square Crypto.  If there’s an explosion of funders for open-source crypto, they are keeping it pretty quiet. Coinbase has talked about support for open source, offering $2,500 per month starting in early 2018. However, there hasn’t been any updates since 2018 and the Coinbase Open Source Engineering site no longer works.  Square Crypto is willing to pay its developers salaries in BTC to fund bitcoin development. Jack Dorsey wants to “improve money."" That statement seems to indicate Dorsey’s not really sure what cryptocurrency is. Yes, people did buy $125 million of BTC from the Cash App. But are they using bitcoin for payments?  Why don’t miners help pay for more open source development? Traders? What are the stakeholders providing funding? Square Crypto. Blockstream. Lightning. MIT. The Ethereum Foundation. Who else is putting resources into crypto development?  2019 has been a good year for Gitcoin. Source: Gitcoin  OKCoin just announced a contest where users vote which version of bitcoin (core, cash, SV) to fund development. The exchange is donation up to a whopping 1,000 BTC. Something feels a little bit divisive about a campaign like this, even though the effort is called “Let’s Build Bitcoin Together!”. Sounds more like building very different versions of bitcoin very separately.  In the ethereum and dapp ecosystem, Gitcoin has paid out over $2 million to developers, with ConsenSys apparently leading the way. Maybe other cryptocurrency projects should have a community-based resource like this. Despite low volumes in the trading market, Gitcoin appears to be working.  Developers over Investors  Recently, Binance announced funding for 40 developers to work on open-source projects.  However, the requirements for an “evangelist” to receive funding means building exclusively on the Binance platform. That seems trading related, although with Binance X and Venus, its likely to compete with Facebook’s cryptocurrency project.  Could it be, shocking as it may seem, that Libra, with 28 members, could help move crypto open source forward?  Despite criticism from literally everyone, the project is still expected to become an open network. Endpoint wallets will still need to provide the KYC/AML compliance. Yet there could be a lot of money contributed to open source surrounding the project. This might be true if they follow the Gitcoin playbook.  Markets don’t always go up. Litecoin has had to cut salaries despite Charlie Lee’s salvo. And the Zcash foundation is spending more than it’s bringing in. Ironic for there to be funded bailouts for cryptocurrency development. Or running deficits. In these cases, it’s easy to blame it on the performance of the crypto market. Because one has to wonder: How will open cryptocurrency development do financially in the future if some of these big-name projects can’t find funding?  Market dynamics have never stopped open source outside of crypto.  Look at Red Hat – no market ever stopped it from figuring out open source. It focused on developers, not investors. Crypto projects should pay attention to what has worked in open source over the years. It should not depend on donations correlated with the whims of the market.
