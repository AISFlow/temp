Kraken is aiming to position itself as the premier cryptocurrency service within the region, identifying Australia as a key growth area for retail and institutional clients. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.      Its acquisition of Bit Trade, a platform that combines liquidity from several exchanges into one interface, signifies a major step into the APAC region by offering local customers access to Kraken’s high trading volumes.      ""Australians will have access to the deep liquidity on Kraken in Australian Dollar (AUD) whilst benefiting from the fast settlement times via local Australian banking and with the security of a local Australian compliance framework,"" Bit Trade CEO Jonathon Miller told CoinDesk in an email.      The entire Bit Trade team will join Kraken as part of the acquisition with Miller becoming ""Managing Director of Kraken in Australia.""      Founded in 2013, Bit Trade quickly built a strong reputation for offering intuitive and sophisticated products without compromising security or regulatory compliance.      The announcement also marks Kraken’s tenth public acquisition, following its most recent take over of Circle Trade in December 2019.      Ryan Watkins, a research analyst at Messari, said in a recent crypto research report that he expects the industry’s top cryptocurrency exchanges by trade volume to partake in nearly $1 billion of acquisitions over the next 24 months.      “Liquidity begets liquidity,"" Watkins wrote.

In his annual speech to the Venezuelan Constituent Assembly, Maduro announced the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, would only accept petro for fuel sold to airlines. ""I decree the sale of all fuel sold by the PDVSA for planes operating international routes be made in petros from now on,"" he said.      It's uncertain whether the new restrictions apply exclusively to the capital's Simón Bolívar International Airport, or whether airlines flying from other airports in the country will be targeted, too. Similarly, it's not clear if the rules will only apply to Venezuelan airlines or include international carriers.      Airlines will be able to purchase fuel using a PetroCard that can convert international currencies, including the U.S. dollar, into petro for payment.      ""[W]e are opening roads to the new economy. We are building a world for the peace and integration of peoples, their happiness and improvement,"" he said.      In his speech, Maduro also declared that government authorities would only accept the petro for document service fees, including passport applications.      Cryptocurrencies are popular in Venezuela, a country where years of hyperinflation have rendered the national bolívar practically worthless. When the government announced it was launching a cryptocurrency backed by the country's vast oil reserves, it hoped the petro could become a new means of payment to help businesses bypass U.S.-imposed sanctions.      But the government has so far struggled to push adoption. Despite Maduro's hopes to make it as widespread as the bolívar, the government said in November that only 400 businesses in the country accepted the petro. In December, he offered public-sector workers, pensioners and soldiers a $30 holiday bonus – in a country where the minimum wage is under $10 a month – for signing up to the state-backed cryptocurrency wallet and payments platform PetroApp.      Maduro previously ordered PDVSA to convert a percentage of its sales and purchases into the petro in early 2018. During Tuesday's speech, the president ordered the company to immediately sell 4.5 million barrels of oil in exchange for the cryptocurrency and from then on to sell a minimum of 50,000 barrels per day as an ""exploration mechanism"" to sound out industry interest.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/15/venezuelas-maduro-airlines-must-use-petros-to-pay-for-fuel,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ea70851c225824c6444c79df5aecc95242a74d9-900x600.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a blog post Wednesday, the Electric Coin Company (ECC) has published an improved Android SDK and new iOS package to help developers support shielded payments on mobile devices. The new software tools come alongside a lightweight server for backend processing of mobile shielded payments, meaning addresses, transaction amounts and memos within transactions are obfuscated.      While multiple zcash wallets already exist for laptop and desktop computers on the ZecWallet service, today's release is a major step toward enabling shielded payments on mobile, the ECC said.      Due to the vast amount of data needed to process shielded payments, facilitating them on mobile devices was technologically difficult. The ECC said it managed to trim data constraints down on mobile versions to implement its Sapling privacy tech.      “What previously required gigabytes of data on a server is now accomplished with megabytes of data and computation suitable for a phone,” the ECC said in an April 2019 blog concerning the Android lightclient release which predated today’s announcement.",POSITIVE,없음,TECHNOLOGY | ZEC,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/15/electric-coin-company-sdk-paves-way-for-shielded-zcash-payments-on-mobile,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c680d8cbc8fff8f09965263594f409eaa17d0e31-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, the moves mark an expansion in offerings for a company originally focused on providing institutions custodial services, as it continues to bet that adding more features like trading will carry crypto further into mainstream.      Merkle Data’s acquisition similarly expands Anchorage's reach, according to the blog post. Framing the data team as a complement to its new trading service, Anchorage said Merkle Data will boost its quantitative analysis and risk modeling capabilities.      The San Francisco-based startup has been building out its services for much of the past year. In October it added a governance platform for on-chain voting, months after introducing Stellar inflation and Tezos staking (called “baking”) to clients holding either crypto asset.      President Diogo Mónica sees these expansions as pivotal for the custodial firm he co-founded. In an opinion piece written for CoinDesk’s Year in Review series, he said, “whatever investors want to do with their assets – buy and hold, exit a major position, actively trade, participate in staking and governance – the custodian will be involved.”      It is also a response to client expectations, said Nathan McCauley, Anchorage CEO.      “This is part of a growing trend,"" he said in a statement sent to CoinDesk. ""Our clients have been asking us to provide brokerage from day one, because they're typically part of the same workflow. Clients buy assets and then deposit them into custody, or withdraw assets from custody in order to sell them. When one provider can do both, it simplifies things for clients significantly.""      The trading service features from slight differences when compared to the “majority” of over-the-counter desks operating today, Anchorage claims. Its platform uses a fee-based model instead of the prevalent principal structure.      Principal model trading allows brokerages to profit off the spread between an asset’s quote and spot price. Fee-based trading, on the other hand, makes money by commission.

As co-founder of the Open Index Protocol, James entered the world of blockchain when she realized it was impossible to control or even find content.      ""I was a writer and director, and so I'm really familiar with the friction that content creators are experiencing,"" she said at the Digital Money Forum at CES 2020. ""Right now it's really hard to make a living. It's really hard to keep track of your stuff. And so I felt really unstable about building a media business that way.""      Ultimately, James sees the future of content as a decentralized system free of major gatekeepers like YouTube and Twitter. But it will take work.      ""If you are on Instagram or you make a show on YouTube, you kind of work in a company town. And if they do something to you, they endanger your entire livelihood,"" she said. ""And so what we're talking about is how this decentralized future is going to make it so that we own our data again, that we own our content that we're putting into the world and that that's just really clear and transparent.""      James' project creates ""a decentralized and transparent index for digital content and protected file persistence."" According to James, it's working. In 2019 the organization saw some solid acceptance including new implementations of the protocol in real-use cases.      First, the organization created a partnership with the state of Wyoming and Overstock's Medici Land Governance blockchain to decentralize property records. The team also created a video series called What Kind of Internet Do You Want? to describe the features of decentralized media.      Ultimately, James sees the decentralized future as a solution to many problems in the media. The key, said James, is making the decentralized tools as easy to use as Medium.      ""How do we bridge this decentralized future that we all dream of with the world of platforms that are so convenient and so easy to use and have so many tools and features?"" she said.

42431414,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2LNh,1579118420,NBA Team Auctioning Basketball Star's Jersey on Ethereum Blockchain,"The Sacramento Kings will auction off starting guard Buddy Hield’s jersey from Wednesday’s game against the Dallas Mavericks using a blockchain-powered marketplace.      Working with ethereum project incubator ConsenSys, the Kings said Wednesday it would be live-auctioning team memorabilia using an ethereum-based platform operated by Treum, a supply-chain product. The platform will be used to verify the provenance of athletic collectibles, with auctions running during and after NBA games.      The platform will help ensure all items being sold are authentic, said Tyler Mulvihill, Treum’s co-founder.      “We've seen time and time again and instances of this exact problem, right? This is the jersey, [is it] real, was it game-worn, how do I know?” he said. “We’re working with the Kings to solve each and every one of those problems.”      He told CoinDesk in a phone call the platform wants to heighten fan experiences, noting that a relatively small number of basketball aficionados are able to make it to games at present.      ""We wanted to create an application that does something real right now, [that] adds enthusiasm,” said Bradley Feinstein, head of business development at ConsenSys. Fans can ""participate live in the game [and] ultimately give them this experience where they can participate with verifiable proof. … [They] understand that what they are about to get is real.”      If the Buddy Hield game jersey auction is successful, here's how future auctions will work: During home games, Kings fans can bid on gear worn by players on the team. Each auction would run from right before tip-off to 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time, with all items authenticated and recorded on Treum. A digital token that will contain data detailing the game, season, player and timestamp will represent proof-of-ownership for items, and will be held by the item’s owner.      Proceeds from auctioning Hield’s jersey will benefit the victims of 2019's Hurricane Dorian (Hield grew up in the Bahamas) while proceeds from future auctions will generally go to the Sacramento Kings Foundation.      Kings Chief Technology Officer Ryan Montoya told CoinDesk the move is only the Kings’ latest foray into blockchain, noting that the team has accepted bitcoin since 2014 and offers other blockchain-based fan experience products.      Calling ConsenSys the “Andreessen Horowitz of crypto,” Montoya said the new auction platform “is going to transform businesses, economy.”      “We just want to be a part of it and share this with our fans,” he said.      The NBA is strictly overseeing memorabilia from its teams, said Ian Wheat, the team's director of innovation and esports.

42431411,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN2L5h,1579114676,NJ Counterterrorism Chief Warns US Congress: Crypto Is Funding 'Domestic Extremism',"New Jersey Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness Director Jared Maples predicted Wednesday that domestic terrorists will increasingly turn to bitcoin.      Speaking during a U.S. House Financial Services Committee monetary policy sub-committee hearing in Washington, Maples said domestic terrorists find value in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies’ security and masked movements.      “They’re seeing the effectiveness of being able to mask those movements,” Maples said. “As cryptocurrency becomes more prevalent and the technology becomes easier to adapt and use, we do believe we’ll see more of that in the domestic terror realm.”      The hearing focused on how domestic terrorists finance their attacks in general, not specifically with bitcoin.      But three of the five witnesses – Maples, Congressional Research Service finance expert Rena Miller and Anti-Defamation League (ADL) Senior Vice President George Selim – addressed crypto’s role in their written and oral testimonies.      Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), a longtime crypto skeptic, pressed Maples for instances of domestic use, saying: “If it works for Hamas, it will work for the Nazis, too.”      Maples responded: “We do see evidence that domestic terror groups are realizing that foreign terror groups like Hamas have been operating using bitcoin due to the encryption [and] due to the difficulties in tracking those transactions.”      Still, government officials have successfully exploited bitcoin’s inherent blockchain traceability to bust high-profile crime rings. Last October, investigators dismantled the world's largest operating child pornography site by using analysis software.      Maples told the committee in his written testimony that one such donation came immediately after the Charlottesville, Virginia, attack in 2017: $60,000 in bitcoin to Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin.      “We cannot discount the future use of cryptocurrencies as a means to fund acts of domestic extremism within New Jersey and across the United States,” Maples wrote in his prepared remarks.      Selim, the ADL executive, also provided testimony of bitcoin’s past use in supporting white nationalists. He cited reports that neo-Nazi troll Andrew “weev” Auernheimer has received massive sums in donated bitcoin, as have white supremacist internet forums like Stormfront and the Daily Stormer.      He nonetheless noted that cryptocurrency businesses like Coinbase enforce sweeping anti-hate policies that prevent customers from transacting in such ways.      “Cryptocurrencies are not a panacea for white supremacists’ money transfer difficulties,” Selim wrote in his testimony.      Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) asked Maples how governments can get ahead of the crypto trend.      “We have to put stringent oversight in place,” Maples said, specifying that this would include ensuring the right people are aware of the risks around crypto as well as monitoring crypto movements themselves.    Privacy concerns    Vargas made clear his belief that government oversight of cryptocurrencies should not turn into overreach. Vargas asked Maples how the government might show restraint and “do it in such a way that we’re able to track this money but at the same time not be so involved in their lives?”      Maples said the government must “remain mindful” of constitutional rights.      “If we get the processes right and in conjunction with the right amount of oversight I think we can get to the right answer to protect and defend our country,” he said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/15/nj-counterterrorism-chief-warns-us-congress-crypto-is-funding-domestic-extremism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b42cf7d5510b6a3fbdc2e8bab54554d1b942d16-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

At a Wednesday hearing revisiting landmark legislation passed 20 years ago, the House of Representatives’ Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission will look at the impact of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, as well as analyze new, technology-enabled threats that need to be addressed. Liat Shetret, head of policy and research at London-based crypto forensics firm Elliptic, is scheduled to testify at the hearing.      Elliptic co-founder Tom Robinson told CoinDesk that cryptocurrency and the dark web are two such areas the House commission will examine.      Shetret is expected to explain how current tools can help law enforcement agents track illicit cryptocurrency payments. Elliptic tells CoinDesk the U.S. can play a leadership role in creating new regulations – or supporting the recommendations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) – around the global use of cryptocurrencies.      One recommendation Shetret is slated to submit: Exchanges using privacy coins should be subject to strict AML rules.      Previous testimony on human trafficking has been critical of cryptocurrencies’ role, driving recommendations that Congress increase regulatory oversight of the industry, Robinson said.      “What I want to do is put cryptocurrency usage in some context and say … the availability of blockchain analysis has been successful in curbing illegal use of cryptocurrency,” he said.      Indeed, fellow crypto analytics startup Chainalysis announced inOctober it had worked with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to trace bitcoin transactions associated with the web’s largest child porn site. The DOJ arrested or indicted nearly 40 individuals, several of whom were traced through their bitcoin use.    Privacy coin concerns    While a large number of crypto transactions can be traced, privacy coins are an exception.      To that end, Shetret’s prepared remarks, which were shared with CoinDesk, will recommend Congress and regulators develop new guidance for banks and crypto exchanges on how to approach privacy coins and the individuals who trade them.      “We respect every individual’s right to financial privacy, and privacy coins have societal value,” Shetret’s testimony says, citing people living under authoritarian regimes.      Still, privacy coins are being used by criminals, and most dark web marketplaces currently accept these cryptocurrencies, she said.      “Regulators should ensure that cryptocurrency businesses that support privacy coins enforce anti-money laundering policies that are appropriate to the lack of traceability inherent to them,” she said.      As part of this, Shetret calls for the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the U.S. Treasury Department’s money laundering monitor, to issue guidance specifically detailing how privacy coins should be treated.      Shetret told CoinDesk in a phone call that Congress should be commended for looking at cryptocurrencies, but the U.S. government and financial institutions should fully grapple with crypto’s incumbent risks.      “There’s a big role that banks generally, financial institutions need to understand their own role and exposure to crypto, and law enforcement needs to understand their transaction monitoring,” Shetret said. “We can’t just talk about it in a vacuum.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/15/crypto-analytics-firm-elliptic-to-tell-us-congress-privacy-coins-need-stricter-aml-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/479f60b0bc2e073d4b37b545b8c48a98748adf7e-900x611.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Coinbase-backed exchange, which began operations in September, will also drop the $10 subscription fee it had planned to collect from traders on a monthly basis. Though based in San Francisco, Blade prohibits U.S. residents from opening accounts on its platform.       Blade will be the first cryptocurrency exchange to offer fee-less trading in bitcoin perpetuals - no-expiry contracts which mimic a margin-based spot market and trade close to the underlying reference price.       Its main rival, BitMEX, which dominates the perpetuals space, is currently charging a 7.5 basis points (bps) taker fee per trade and so are other competitors, namely Deribit and ByBit.       Further, there will be no restrictions or eligibility requirements. This is in contrast to a few exchanges that offer products somewhat similar to zero-fee trading, but require users to buy and hold exchange tokens.       With a fee-less, zero-eligibility model, Blade is hoping to attract meaningful volume from the likes of BitMEX and other exchanges. Blade also offers up to 150x leverage, compared to BitMEX’s 100x leverage.       The increased volume could come from high-frequency trades like scalpers, who enter and exit quickly, usually within seconds, using high leverage to make many small profits from large numbers of trades throughout the trading day. Scalpers work on thin margins and need lower costs to make money.

42403791,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmhe,1579100400,"JPMorgan Veterans' Kadena Launches Public Blockchain, Integrates Wallet to Cosmos Network","Crypto startup Kadena’s public blockchain launched Wednesday, adding interoperable smart contract support between the public chain and its private chain counterparts.      The Brooklyn-based offshoot of JPMorgan’s blockchain center announced the launch marks another step in its effort to develop scalable, secure proof-of-work alternatives to the current leading cryptocurrencies ethereum and bitcoin. As part of its efforts in interoperability, Kadena is also integrating its wallet Chainweaver with the Cosmos Network, allowing different blockchains to interact.      The integration process is expected to be complete by March.      Using Kadena, individuals or businesses can begin looking at apps and projects that use “a fully-scalable base layer as a piece of public infrastructure” while maintaining privacy features to address any regulatory or other concerns, founder and president Stuart Popejoy told CoinDesk.    Public chains    Using an in-house smart contract language called Pact, Kadena said the advancement introduces a “hybrid blockchain” model capable of processing 750 transactions per second, though 750 is just Kadena’s conservative estimate. Popejoy, who previously directed JP Morgan's Blockchain Center of Excellence, said his protocol’s braided blockchain design can accommodate even industrial use cases.      According to Popejoy, the durability of ethereum and bitcoin proves PoW’s value but their failures to reliably process transactions (bitcoin) or grow to the demands of decentralized apps (ethereum) makes them unsuitable for enterprise use cases.      Public chains are also anathema to certain sensitive contexts such as medical privacy issues, he said.      “Kadena’s whole goal is to solve the scaling problems of bitcoin and the security problems of ethereum,” Popejoy said.      The hybrid model based on a PoW protocol hopes to take on this issue by essentially allowing users to switch between chains using the Pact programming language.      “You have a scalable private blockchain, you have a scalable public blockchain and you have Pact, and the application layer that allows you to communicate between all three,” Popejoy said.      Kadena said a number of companies already plan to utilize its hybrid blockchain model in finance and healthcare, including Rymedi, a South Carolina medical technology firm and facilitator of an FDA-approved study of blockchain tracing specialty prescription drugs.    Multiple chains    To further aid its scaling and interoperability goals, Kadena hopes to conclude its Cosmos integration by the end of March.      As part of the move, Kadena will make Pact available on Cosmos as Kadenamint, meaning developers will be able to create smart contracts using Kadena’s token starting Wednesday.      “Besides storing cryptocurrencies, our multi-blockchain wallet can provide a tool kit and user-friendly programming environment for developers on the Cosmos Network,” said Kadena founder Will Martino, another JPMorgan veteran, once lead engineer for the bank's blockchain prototype, Juno.      Developers can write smart contracts for both Cosmos and Kadena from the same interface using Chainweaver. The wallet includes features such as Formal Verification and capabilities-based security, according to Martino.      To fund its operations, Kadena raised $15 million in 2018 from investors including Multicoin Capital and the private investment arm of the owners of Fidelity Investments. The firm aims to raise another $20 million via a token sale.      Ethan Buchman, technical director of the Interchain Foundation, one of Cosmos’ largest backers, said in a statement that scalability, security and usability are all major issues to address.      ""We're working with Kadena to integrate their digital wallet Chainweaver into the larger Cosmos ecosystem to tackle these issues like never before, enabling users to build Pact smart contracts running on the Tendermint consensus engine through Chainweaver's stellar UX,"" Buchman said.

42403803,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmrU,1579099236,Uphold Opens Crypto Trading to Users With UK Bank Accounts,"Trading platform Uphold has added pound sterling support, meaning users can trade cryptocurrencies via payments from U.K. bank accounts.      The new connectivity launched into beta Wednesday and is expected to become publicly available on Jan. 21. Near-instant transfers will soon also be enabled through the U.K.'s Faster Payments Service (FPS) in the coming weeks.      After that, U.K. users will be able to make zero-fee deposits with bank cards, which can settle in seconds using FPS. They can also make deposits with eight supported cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, ether and XRP. Using Uphold's third-party providers, users can earn interest on fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies stored on the platform.      Founded in 2013 as Bitreserve, the platform originally launched as a straight play to make cryptocurrencies more accessible. The company rebranded to Uphold in 2015 when it expanded its mission to offer financial services in a broader range of assets.      According to Uphold CEO J.P. Thieriot, the platform is designed to ""democratize access to financial markets."" Describing it as ""one of our most important markets,"" he added: ""The U.K couldn’t be joining us at a more important time as we’re opening around 7,000 new accounts per day thanks to our expanded line up of services.""      At the height of the ICO boom in 2017, some exchanges reported they were onboarding tens of thousands of new users every day. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao told Bloomberg at the time the platform once had 240,000 new registrations in an hour.      Uphold has more than 1.7 million users globally and a cumulative volume of $6 billion. As well as a trading platform, it can also be used to send funds free of charge. Using an automatic exchange facility means users can make transactions with different assets.

42403789,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmfg,1579096800,Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Launches Testing Ground for Blockchain Interoperability,"The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), the standards group where finance and other industries explore private versions of ethereum technology, has launched a testing ground to bring about certified, branded and harmonized business uses by the end of 2020.      The EEA TestNet will operate as a pre-certification sandbox, where forks of ethereum can be standardized according to certain specifications set out previously by the EEA, which will make them interoperable with each other. There are now hundreds of companies working on enterprise versions of ethereum, plus an entirely new cohort of industry players joining the fold via Hyperledger’s ethereum-based member Besu, making standardization a priority.      As it stands, ethereum-based clients and protocols are frequently unable to talk to each other. For example, Quorum, the privacy-centric version of ethereum built by mega-bank JPMorgan, can’t operate with Hyperledger Besu, which is designed to work seamlessly across private deployments and the public ethereum mainnet.      “Early on in technology families, people do often make assumptions of interoperability. But when you actually put these pieces together in an app, they don't work,” said Paul DiMarzio, director of community for the EEA.      The launch of the testing ground, developed by DLT testing platform Whiteblock Genesis, brings the EEA standards program into its “middle stage,” said DiMarzio.      “We are providing a place where clients can start to get their feet wet in a testing environment and then, towards the end of the year, will provide the actual ability to certify against those specifications. Then we can actually stamp things as being EEA certified and branded and have that guarantee of interoperability as opposed to an assumption,” he said.      Zak Cole, CEO of Whiteblock, takes up a role as chair of the EEA Testing and Certification Working Group. Cole said the TestNet will exist indefinitely as businesses continue to join the ethereum community. “Even if we have some tech specs finalized, people are going to want to be able to experiment within a low-risk environment,” he said.      There has been some suggestion of rivalry between JPMorgan’s Quorum and Hyperledger Besu, which was built by engineers at PegaSys, one of the main spokes in the ConsenSys wheel of ethereum-based startups.      The current disconnect between Quorum and Besu turns on a subtle difference in the implementation of the Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerant (IBFT) consensus algorithm (Besu refers to its version IBFT2), which DiMarzio said the new test environment could help “iron out.”      “Some scenarios include public transactions, private transactions, permissioning, block validation and the IBFT consensus mechanism,” said Dan Heyman, head of PegaSys, in a statement about planned test scenarios for Besu. ""An EEA certification program is being talked about for potentially the end of 2020.""      JPMorgan declined to comment.      DiMarzio said EEA needs to coordinate its testing program with the Ethereum Foundation, which is overseeing the rollout of the ethereum 2.0 public blockchain, but the majority of the EEA’s focus is not directly concerned with the complex switch to a proof of stake (PoS) system of block creation.      ""The EEA TestNet is intended for members to run applications that follow current EEA specifications. PoW and PoS are consensus algorithms, and the current EEA client spec does not dictate what specific consensus algorithm must be used. A shift in base protocols from PoW to PoS will of course be evaluated by the working groups to determine if the specs (and TestNet) should be changed,"" he said.      Most private clients currently substitute different consensus algorithms, such as IBFT, Raft, and Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET).      ""The EEA working groups are in particular looking at Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithms, primarily those related to IBFT, for potential future adds to the spec,"" said DiMarzio.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/15/enterprise-ethereum-alliance-launches-testing-ground-for-blockchain-interoperability,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/700764f2571e76b5448bd66d3c0cbfaf1de17ff2-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Announced Wednesday, the Vancouver, British Columbia-based Voyager said its support of tether (USDT), USD coin (USDC) and true USD (TUSD) would enable traders to better manage risk and fund their accounts without going through a bank.      “Adding these three new stablecoins to our platform gives our customers an alternative funding mechanism and another means to hedge their risk in the crypto market,” said Stephen Ehrlich, Voyager co-founder and CEO.      Voyager allows both retail and institutional investors commission-free trading on multiple exchanges from a single account. The platform uses technology said to ensure traders get the best prices available. The firm earns revenue by taking a spread from orders executed at levels better than quoted at order submission.      Ehrlich, who used to be the CEO of E*Trade, founded Voyager with Oscar Salazar, the former CTO of Uber, in the summer of 2018. The broker began offering interest on 3 percent APR on bitcoin last November, following its acquisition of wallet startup Ethos earlier that year.      “Voyager customers will also be able to earn interest on these stablecoins, giving them another way to grow wealth in the crypto industry,” said Ehrlich. Deposits and withdrawals for all three stablecoins opened earlier Wednesday, with interest-earning beginning Feb. 1.      The brokerage firm took the unusual step of a reverse merger in 2019, purchasing the majority of shares in a publicly traded company – in this case, a defunct mining exploration company – and combining in order to become listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.      By becoming a listed company, Voyager now makes quarterly and annual disclosures of its financials and answers to the Canadian securities regulator. That can help build trust with traders, according to Ehrlich, who said there was ""an increase in demand for users looking for new, secure platforms to buy and trade crypto assets.""",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | USDT,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/15/voyager-to-offer-interest-on-three-newly-listed-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b427bce05a5c5f211c7fa9dfa76414abcd32cc15-1866x1133.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403802,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmtS,1579088134,UN Warns Against Attending North Korean Crypto Conference Next Month,"The United Nations is warning about the risks of attending North Korea's cryptocurrency conference in February.      Reuters reports Wednesday that going to the event would probably be a violation of international sanctions, according to a confidential report soon to be put before the U.N. Security Council.      The news comes after ethereum developer Virgil Griffith was arrested and more recently indicted over attending the conference to give a talk last April. Griffith has been charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.      North Korea has been accused, in another UN report, of funding its weapons of mass destruction program with hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as banking institutions. The August 2019 report said North Korea has used “widespread and increasingly sophisticated” hacks to amass around $2 billion, which is laundered over the internet.      Any effort seen to be enabling the regime's efforts to circumvent sanctions would likely be illegal under UN rules.      “Supporting the DPRK’s use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, risks violating the Security Council’s resolutions because it would unavoidably increase the DPRK’s ability to subvert sanctions and generate revenue for its weapons programs,” an anonymous British government spokesman told Reuters.      The website for the North Korean event is reportedly seeking to attract U.S. attendees, saying their passports will not be stamped on entry, helping to obfuscate their visit.      An excerpt from the new UN report, seen by Reuters, states that past talks at the crypto conference “have included explicit discussions of cryptocurrency for sanctions evasion and money laundering.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/15/un-warns-against-attending-north-korean-crypto-conference-next-month,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7014cdcc0e570039913c47e936da36de648dd010-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42403806,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdgmxO,1579086790,Bitcoin Eyes $9K After Biggest Single-Day Rise in a Month,"View  Bitcoin violated crucial resistance near $8,460 on Tuesday, strengthening the case for a rise to the 200-day average at $9,100.  The pullback seen in the last 12 hours or so lacks volume support and could be short-lived.  Acceptance under Tuesday's low of $8,100 would abort the short-term bullish bias. Indicators, however, are reporting strong bullish momentum, so a drop below $8,100 looks unlikely.    Bitcoin jumped sharply on Tuesday, violating key resistance and opening the doors for a test of a widely followed technical line above $9,000.      The number one cryptocurrency by market value added nearly $800 to its price and ended the day (UTC) with 8.74 percent gains – the biggest single-day gain since Dec. 15, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Back then, bitcoin had reversed higher from an eight-month low of $6,425 to score its first double-digit gain since Oct. 25. The big move from multi-month lows warned of an impending reversal of the six-month bearish period – a trend change that was confirmed with last week’s 11 percent price gain.      That bullish breakout has been bolstered by Tuesday’s move above $8,463 – passing the resistance of a lower high created on Jan. 8.      As a result, the next major resistance – the 200-day moving average (MA) located at $9,100 – could soon come into play.      At press time, bitcoin is changing hands near $8,710, representing a 1.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.      While prices have pulled back from Tuesday’s high of $8,900, the technical charts suggest it's nothing more than a temporary correction.    Daily chart    Bitcoin rose more than 8 percent and closed well above $8,463 on Tuesday. The breakout above the lower high was accompanied by the strongest buying volumes (green bar) since Nov. 25, according to Bitstamp data.      Volumes also rose sharply on major exchanges including Bitfinex and Coinbase, which are included in the calculation of Bitwise’s “real 10” bitcoin trading volume listing along with Bitstamp.      As a result, further gains could be in the offing, more so as there are no signs of overbought conditions. The 14-day relative strength index is yet to cross into overbought territory above 70.00.      Further, bullish momentum is looking strong with the five- and 10-day averages sloping upwards.    Hourly chart    In the six hours to 05:00 UTC, trading volumes dipped as the cryptocurrency pulled back from $8,900 to $8,555. A low-volume price drop is often short-lived.      The RSI has also realigned in favor of the bulls as opposed to above-70 readings seen 24 hours ago.      All in all, bitcoin looks set to pass the psychological resistance of $9,000 and test the 200-day MA at $9,100 in the short-term.      A UTC close above the 200-day MA would expose key resistances located at $9,400 and $10,350.      Popular analyst Josh Rager expects a potential break above $10,350 to set the tone for a major bull run for months to come.      The cryptocurrency reversed sharply lower from $10,350 in October, so a move past that resistance could attract keener buying.      The short-term bullish view would be invalidated if prices find acceptance under Tuesday's low of $8,105. That level could come into play if the cryptocurrency breaches the former hurdle-turned-support of $8,463 on the back of strong volumes.

The San Francisco firm requested the withdrawal in a filing posted with the SEC on Tuesday, while NYSE Arca – the ETF's sponsor – has also withdrawn the associated 19b-4 filing for the fund.      While the news may disappoint those in the investment community keen to see the first ever bitcoin ETF in the U.S., the news is not surprising. The proposal was rejected by the SEC in October, although the regulator said soon after that it was reviewing the rejection.      The proposal did not meet legal requirements to prevent market manipulation or other illicit activities, the commission said in its rejection announcement.      ""This is the next step towards our long-term goal of bringing a bitcoin ETF to market, and we plan to refile our application at an appropriate time. We are currently working hard on answering the questions that the SEC raised in its 112-page response to our initial filing,"" according to Matthew Hougan, Bitwise's global head of research.      ""We remain fully committed to the development of a bitcoin [exchange-traded product], and will update you when we have more details on our timeline,"" he said.

The similarities between the two represent an uncomfortable truth, particularly when you consider that many of the parties who have leveled such criticisms at cryptocurrencies over the last three years have been the issuers and defenders of cash itself: central banks.      Ahead of the annual meeting in Davos, where many central bankers, movers and shakers will gather to discuss what the future of finance holds, it is worth remembering where we have come from. In particular, we should remember the characteristics – and the consequences – of the existence of cash, that relic of the past.      I have long held that, were cash invented today, it would be dismissed by policymakers, bankers and law enforcement as dystopian, absurd and dangerous. Regulators would wring their hands over tax evasion and terrorist financing. Central bankers would worry about the implications on their ability to institute negative interest rates. Executives at the heart of the financial system would scoff at the idea of such an archaic system: “What does one do with it?” they would laugh. “Carry it around in a suitcase?”      And yet, for the last hundred years, physical cash has been central to the global financial system. Ahead of his time, economist Ken Rogoff wrote in 2014, in “The Costs and Benefits to Phasing Out Paper Currency,” that roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s M2 money supply was held in paper cash. Clearly, despite the many issues posed by this asset in this medium, cash remains in high demand.      This should be little wonder. Physical cash can perform many wonders that digital forms of money have (until recently) never been able to offer. Cash is more immune to seizure from banks and governments than a savings account. Cash offers underground economies a cloak of privacy. Perhaps most importantly, cash enables those who do not have access to bank accounts an ability to save and transact in their local currency. These guarantees have formed an important foundation of demand for paper currency.      While paper money remains relevant today, the world is trending in another direction. Digital payments systems, from AliPay to Zelle, are replacing the use of cash. These shifts have prompted policymakers, politicians, and pundits around the world to explore central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and corporate-issued coins as the next generation of money. Sweden’s Riksbank is working toward an “e-Krona” in the face of dwindling cash use. Facebook’s Libra project has been framed by Mark Zuckerberg himself as a direct answer to China’s digital cash systems, both existent and emerging.      Amidst all of the printed words and proofs-of-concept, however, policymakers would do well to remember that perhaps the most important experiment with digital money – bitcoin – has been running for over a decade in plain sight. The last year has seen CBDCs and corporate coins grab headlines while decentralized cryptocurrencies have often been relegated to a footnote, dismissed as unusable, untenable and even unethical.      But cryptocurrencies have much in common with that other product that has long been a central part of the global financial system: cash. Cryptocurrencies' importance and implications – for local and global policymaking, for matters of privacy and for the preservation of civil liberties – ought not to be underestimated and ought to be just as central to the conversations of those gathering at Davos.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Jill Carlson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/15/ahead-of-davos-what-can-cash-teach-us-about-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5a8fc3dfd06cdcf59ec824038c06c7754d3853c-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A one-time Venezuelan gold mining outfit-turned multinational crypto startup, First Bitcoin registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) last week – an initial step, said CEO Greg Rubin, in providing fragmented bitcoin ATMs a new network.      His plan: link thousands of ATMs run by dozens of often small-time operators with a comprehensive know-your-customer, transaction monitoring and regulatory compliance solution that streamlines every aspect of the back-end business.      “We want to create a consortium of bitcoin ATM operators and put them on the global ATM network,” Rubin said. He said the consortium will roll out this year.      First Bitcoin, based in Holon, Israel, has been active in the crypto space for years, offering a bitcoin exchange and ATM services. The SEC temporarily suspended trading of its shares in 2017.      First Bitcoin’s network hinges on its recently acquired 2015 patent. U.S. 9,135,787 B1, otherwise known as “Bitcoin Kiosk/ATM Device and System Integrating Enrollment Protocol and Method of Using the Same,” came under First Bitcoin’s control last summer in exchange for 1.6 million shares, according to the SEC filing.      Rubin insisted the patent is more than a legal bludgeon. He said he has no desire to become a patent troll, referring to those those who scoop up intellectual property rights and then sue infringers, often frivolously, seeking compensation and damages.      “We don’t want to send two big Italian guys with baseball bats” to enforce the patent, Rubin said.      Instead, First Bitcoin will use the patent to make inroads among operators. Rubin said the relationship will be mutually beneficial: First Bitcoin will charge a flat transaction fee comparable to ATM fees, and operators will meet local compliance and regulatory burdens via its network.      Rubin said small-time operators stand to gain the most from this globalized network      “You cannot continue operating like you’re in the Stone Age with 10 machines,” he said. “We will be on top of the regulations, we will be on top of security. Your role is just to promote the business.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/01/15/former-venezuelan-gold-mining-company-wants-to-centralize-bitcoin-atm-infrastructure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9f7c23209e1144dadab25753950e8b99c59d6057-1200x818.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

IBM's Food Trust project, of which Sánchez is a part, aims to allow growers, grocers and cooks to track their food from seed to plate.      The system, said IBM General Manager of Blockchain Services Jason Kelley, uses the blockchain simply because it is the cheapest way to get everyone – from the farmer in the field to a tech-loving chef like Sánchez – to connect. Rather than forcing each participant to run massive data stores or buy expensive gear, this blockchain allows for most of the interaction to happen using 3D-printed hardware and cellphones.      Sánchez is the founder of the restaurant Johnny Sanchez in New Orleans and a judge on the television show MasterChef.      Originally aimed at managing food supply chains for big corporations like Nestle, the new tech allows for farmers to optically or chemically scan their products using simple electronics. Then, as the food moves from farmer to supplier to kitchen, everyone involved can confirm the product matches the description. In fact, IBM showed off how its technology can ""read"" the colors in olive oil and help identify the manufacturer. One manufacturer, CHO, is already shipping its blockchain-tracked oil to Whole Foods stores.      We spoke with Kelley and Sánchez at CES 2020. In fact, Sánchez cooked with blockchain-tracked produce including kale and scallops.
