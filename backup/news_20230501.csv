Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: As Asia's trading day begins, bitcoin drops 4% to $27,981 and ether declines 2.45% to $1,824.

Bitcoin is opening the trading day in Asia at $27,981, down 4.9% in the last 24 hours, while ether is down 3.8% to $1,824.  Despite this slow retreat from $30,000, co-founder and CEO of research platform The Tie Joshua Frank pointed out on a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV’s ""All About Bitcoin"" that there are still many positive market indicators for bitcoin.  Bitcoin's market cap dominance is surging again, nearing June 2020 highs, he noted, but liquidity remains a challenge.  ""I think a lot of institutions are excited about bitcoin. I think that the risk-off narrative is resonating right now. Just like it did in 2021,"" he said, while explaining that a shortage of liquidity remains a challenge for the market but is also leading to bitcoin’s overall outperformance.  ""Bitcoin is outperforming due to several reasons, including market consolidation, low trading volume, and banking uncertainty,” he said. ""In the short term, bitcoin is more correlated to gold. However, the U.S. regulatory environment is unenthusiastic and negative towards crypto, contributing to low liquidity.”  As the week continues, traders will be looking to U.S. job openings on Tuesday and news from the Federal Reserve about interest rate moves on Wednesday.  Biggest Gainers  There are no gainers in CoinDesk 20 today.  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Solana SOL −5.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM −5.3% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC −4.7% Currency  Insights  By Jack Tan, co-founder of Woo Network  Crypto companies may have to move from the U.S. due to stifling regulations.  However, Western founders and teams may continue to dominate innovation by looking East, where governments are embracing new technologies.  These countries and jurisdictions have passed more crypto-friendly laws and created a welcoming business environment for firms in the digital asset space. The mix for Western companies with talent and other resources can be potentially powerful.  Regulation has become a central issue in the crypto asset space as the U.S. responds to multiple debacles that have undermined confidence in crypto. The Biden administration recently shifted its position on crypto from neutral to negative through its White House Council of Economic Advisers, which said that “crypto assets do not appear to offer investors any fundamental value to date.”  Exodus of talent, capital  Major crypto players no longer look to the U.S. for leadership, and they have been seeking other jurisdictions from which to grow. For example, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the crypto industry has “already started” moving outside the U.S., while crypto exchange giant Coinbase, whose once-upbeat outlook about U.S. regulation has soured, may start an overseas trading desk. And Circle is opening a new office outside the United States.  It’s hard to imagine that they would go to the European Union because even the G-7, an intergovernmental political forum consisting almost entirely of western countries, is outlining tougher regulations for digital assets. A French bill, for example, stipulates that companies will have to meet extra rules on internal controls, cybersecurity and conflicts of interest.  Why move east?  Regulators are more supportive in Asia’s financial centers. Japan recently relaxed token listing requirements. Hong Kong announced it was open to crypto firms, Thailand said it would waive taxes for initial coin offerings (ICO), and Dubai’s regulatory framework hopes to become a global crypto hub.  The East is also l playing a bigger role in cultivating crypto innovation by spurring higher crypto adoption rates. The East dominates analytics firm Chainalysis’ top 20 global crypto adoption index, including Vietnam, the Philippines, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Indonesia and China.  Additionally, money is flowing into the region. China's third-largest state-owned insurance institution – Pacific Insurance Investment Management Hong Kong Branch – and Waterdrop Capital unveiled compliant blockchain venture capital and POS token income enhancement funds, respectively. Dubai-based Cypher Capital is looking to raise over $100 million for a new venture capital fund to target ""Asian technology tycoons."" HashKey Capital, which is instrumental in moving crypto forward in Hong Kong, has closed its third blockchain funding at $500 million with a focus on growth opportunities in emerging markets.  How could the West still dominate?  A more open regulatory environment, faster crypto adoption and flow of funds to the region do not necessarily translate to the East having dominant market players in the crypto space. And western countries still have relatively stronger economies and cultivate exceptionally brilliant talents through an ingrained culture of innovation, and the strongest financial markets.  Westerners have founded the most innovative firms in the crypto space. For example, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Binance founder Changpeng Zhao were raised and educated in Canada. The founders at Coinbase, Grayscale, OpenSea, Gemini, Kraken, Uniswap, and Chainalysis are mostly from the U.S. and educated in the U.S. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)  The West dominates the top 10 rankings of the most innovative economies as measured by the Global Innovation Index, including Switzerland, the United States, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Denmark. We would expect that innovative crypto projects would continue to originate from these locations.  The crypto space needs the support of the financial and fintech centers, and the majority of the top-ranking ones are still from the West. In the Global Financial Centres Index released last month, 14 of the top 20 financial centers are from the West, including New York, San Francisco, London, Los Angeles, Boston and Washington, D.C.  The importance of a robust, risk-reward framework  Having worked in the finance industry all my professional life, I have witnessed how innovations are borne from crises and deeply stressful situations. Innovation is often messy.  Companies and governments forget this, and often it’s the leaders that enact policies that lean too heavily toward protecting the status quo by limiting risk. We’ve seen once-innovative companies such as Kodak and IBM lose their edge as they focus more on stability and the bottom line for shareholders. Meanwhile, scrappy startups with vision, talent and nothing to lose sometimes succeed wildly – provided they can operate in nurturing environments.  An East-West partnership may be crypto’s model for the future.

As of December 31, 2022, 1.9% of USDC outstanding was owned by COIN, up from 0.8% in September 2022. Has COIN increased their ownership of USDC since Dec 2022? With COIN not the sole beneficiary of income generated from USDC, why would COIN increase their USDC investment instead of investing directly in the underlying Treasuries backing USDC? With 15% of revenues collected in crypto assets and not fiat currency, COIN needs price appreciation in crypto assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum to increase earnings. Coinbase's (COIN) December 2022 10-K and USDC Examination Reports raise a number of questions going into the March 2023 earnings. USCoin (USDC-USD) is a stablecoin backed 1:1 by US Treasuries or US dollars held in US financial institutions. USDC is administered and governed by the Centre Consortium, which was co-founded by COIN and Circle, the issuer of USDC. USDC is a meaningful contributor to COIN's revenue growth as disclosed below in the 2022 10-K. USDC - a leading US dollar stablecoin redeemable 1:1 for US dollars - is an asset whereby we have a unique commercial arrangement and generate income through means other than our customers' engagement with our products and services. We offer rewards on USDC to our customers in order to encourage participation . Within transaction revenue and subscription and services revenue, a meaningful concentration is from transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum and interest income in connection with USDC , respectively. In particular , our subscription and services revenue has grown over time with interest income received in connection with USDC is becoming a more meaningful revenue contributor. Therefore, our operating results could fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the demand for our subscription and service offerings, in the demand for USDC, the balance of USDC on our platform, in interest rates, and to our ongoing relationships with third parties, such as the issuer of USDC. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we derived a more meaningful amount of our net revenue from interest income, primarily in connection with USDC, than we have historically. As illustrated in the chart below, despite the rewards offered by COIN to encourage participation, the amount of USDC outstanding has contracted materially over the past year. While the quantity of USDC outstanding has declined, COIN has increased their ownership from $100 mln USDC as of December 2022 (0.2% of USDC outstanding) to $861 mln (1.9% of USDC outstanding) as of December 31, 2022. Investors should pay close attention to COIN's USDC holdings as of March 31, 2023. COIN is not the sole beneficiary of earnings generated from USDC as the 10-K explains. We earn income on fiat funds under a revenue sharing arrangement with the issuer of USDC, pursuant to which we share any interest income generated from USDC reserves pro rata based on (i) the amount of USDC distributed by each respective party and (ii) the amount of USDC held on each respective party's platform. Our income is dependent on the balance of such fiat funds and the prevailing interest rate environment. Since COIN is not receiving 100% of the revenues generated by USDC, then why would COIN invest any of their cash into USDC versus directly owning the underlying Treasuries USDC is backed by? Rather than investing nearly $860 million into USDC, COIN would be better served to have purchased the underlying Treasuries backing USDC and not sharing any of the interest income. With the amount of USDC outstanding declining from $55.6 billion in June 2022 to $32.5 billion as of March 31, 2023 (down 41%), investors should take note of whether COIN has increased or decreased their USDC position at the end of March 2023, and what percentage COIN's ownership represents of the total USDC outstanding. COIN discloses in their 10-K that 15% of their revenues came not in fiat currency, but in crypto assets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we collected approximately 15% of total revenue in crypto assets. We currently do not have any formal policies requiring conversion of these crypto assets received into fiat currency. There is no disclosure as to what portion of these crypto assets received as revenue were in the liquid and transparent markets for Bitcoin or Ethereum (ETH-USD) versus the nontransparent and nebulously categorized ""Other crypto assets"" that constituted 49% of COIN's transaction revenue from crypto traded on COIN's platform. For perspective, Bitcoin trading represented only 29% of COIN's transaction revenue and Ethereum transactions 22% of COIN's revenues. COIN discloses up to 10% of quarterly earnings can be invested in crypto assets. With COIN accepting 15% of revenues in crypto and with 10% of earnings plowed back into crypto assets, COIN's earnings are levered to price appreciation of crypto assets. If crypto prices remain flat, there is no boost to earnings and earnings will remain entirely dependent upon staking, trading volume and interest income from USDC. If crypto prices decline, earnings will be adversely impacted as illustrated with COIN's massive 2022 loss following their $3 billion profit for 2021. Recommendation: Avoid COIN. If you're a crypto bull, then own the crypto asset directly. With the amount of USDC outstanding contracting rapidly, there is limited upside to COIN and plenty of downside risk. For crypto bulls, a short position in COIN could serve as an effective hedge on a price decline in crypto assets.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | USDC,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4598644-coinbase-10k-and-usdc-examination-reports-raise-questions-march-2023-earnings?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12274829.jpeg

42393629,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1W6F,1682977189,Bitcoin Drops Below $28K; JPMorgan Takes Over Embattled First Republic Bank,"Bitcoin (BTC) kicked off the U.S. trading week edging below $28,000 – the continuation of a downward spiral that started on Sunday as federal regulators prepared to seize control of First Republic Bank.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $27,800, down over 5% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. BTC had been hovering around $28,500 as U.S. markets opened and it was announced banking giant JPMorgan had won the auction to purchase First Republic assets.  Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange Oanda, suggested in a note that the fast response to First Republic’s implosion showed the banking sector was prepared to address these types of crises. Wall Street may have grown confident that wider banking risk has been “removed from the table,” Moya wrote.  “It is looking like the U.S. banking system has a playbook to deal with the next banking crisis when it emerges, which is somewhat dampening the case for cryptos,” he added.  San Francisco-based First Republic is the fourth bank to fail in the past two months, following Silvergate, Silicon Valley and Signature banks.  Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, followed a similar pattern to bitcoin, dropping more than 4% to change hands at around $1,813 Monday afternoon.  Equities were closing lower Monday, with the S&P 500, Wall Street's benchmark equity index, down 0.04%. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite recently slid 0.1%.  Investors will be eyeing the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) monetary policy meeting, which begins Tuesday to decide whether to boost interest rates and by how much. The CME’s FedWatch tool currently sets the probability of a 25 basis point (bps) increase at more than 94%, which would boost the target range to between 5% and 5.25%.  Some analysts expected the decision may cause price fluctuations in the crypto market.  “After a breakout (BTC above ~$25,000), it’s important to pay attention to pullbacks to gauge the buy strength remaining,” bitcoin mining equipment and hosting provider Blockware Solutions Analysts wrote in a newsletter on Friday. “In this case, BTC flashed some pretty bullish signals, as buyers quickly stepped in at the 50-day [simple moving average].”  Blockware Solutions’ analysts said BTC has strong resistance between $30,000 and $31,000, although they noted that “it’s not unreasonable to assume that the FOMC policy decision could make or break current BTC strength.”  April recap  After soaring in March, bitcoin rose a more modest 2.5% in April amid crypto regulatory, banking and other macroeconomic uncertainties, according to the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the crypto market’s overall performance. Ether climbed 4.4%, much of its gains coming when the successful Ethereum Shanghai upgrade did not lead to a mass ETH sell-off, as some market observers had expected.  Blockchain-based distributed rendering service Render Network’s utility token RNDR was the best-performing asset in the CMI, rising 77%, and was followed by the decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Injective Protocol’s INJ token, which jumped 69%.  Chain's XCN token in the CMI's Currency sector was among the biggest CMI laggards, plunging over 33% in April. It dropped over 53% in March.  But regulation remains a major stumbling block for the industry. In the U.S., exchange giant Coinbase (COIN) demanded that a federal court force the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to clarify whether existing securities laws apply to digital assets, and the European Union finalized legislation that aims to clarify the region’s regulatory approach to the sector.

12272440,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529422,1682976602,"Bitcoin Is Crashing, But Why Are Transactions At New All-Time Highs","In a day when Bitcoin prices are crashing, posting worrying drops from April 2023 peaks, the underlying network is processing record transactions. Bitcoin Prices Dropping, But Why? Dune Analytics data on May 1 shows that the platform is processing record transactions which, if going by historical performance, would typically point to demand. In a normal scenario, this demand could translate to buying pressure. However, as seen in the chart below, the spike in the activity on the Bitcoin network is attributed to the non-fungible token (NFT) collection “Ordinals.” The demand for these assets has interfered with the normal on-chain dynamics. We can see a shift in preference as it relates to inscription types. Image Inscriptions 🟧 dominated until very recently, but have been surpassed by text based 🟦. Over 2.39M Inscriptions have been added to the #Bitcoin ledger, adding 9.3GB in data, and paying 212 $BTC in fees. pic.twitter.com/KZPy074WoP — glassnode (@glassnode) April 30, 2023 In that sense, despite the high block demand, BTC prices are down 4% in the past 24 hours, crashing 10% from April 2023 peaks, and are likely to clear critical support levels immediately. Notably, sellers have quickly reversed the gains of April 27. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Continue To Sell While Bitcoin prices remain under pressure when writing, the coin is within a broader trade range. Key reaction points remain at $31,000 on the upper hand, a level flashing with April 2023 peaks, and $26.5k on the lower end, a support level marking the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the March to April trade range. Moreover, from mid-March 2023, BTC rallied approximately 60%, floating higher as the financial markets feared another meltdown in the United States banking sector. Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) experienced a bank run in March while two more crypto-centric banks, including Signature Bank, closed shop. High On Chain Activity, A New Normal For BTC? Bitcoin prices are now cooling off, looking at the performance in the daily chart. This is despite positive news based on blockchain activity. According to Dune Analytics, the Bitcoin network has processed more transactions than any other day since launching 14 years ago. On May 1, on-chain data showed that the platform processed 568,300 transactions, 78,000 more than it processed at the peaks of the 2017 Bull Run. Even though activity has exploded, an analysis of the chunk of transactions processed revealed that over 50%, or 307,000, were inscriptions from Bitcoin Ordinals. Dune data shows that the number of inscriptions is up 16% from April 29 and maintains an upward trend pointing to increasing user demand. The Bitcoin Ordinals allow users to attach or “inscribe” files on the Bitcoin network, including apps, videos, audio, images, texts, and more. Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Potential Price Drop To $25,000, On-Chain Data Signals Bearish Trend These files are unique, “inscribed” at the Satoshi level, and permanently stored on Bitcoin blocks. The more files inscribed, the more transactions there are, explaining the “spike” in the number of on-chain transactions processed in recent days. As of May 1, over 2.9 million files were attached to the Bitcoin network, with the number of average inscriptions rising from less than 10,000 in early February to over 300,000 in early May 2023. As mentioned above, the rapid rise of “inscriptions” doesn’t necessarily translate to demand for BTC. The underlying network is a transactional layer, enabling the transfer of funds. It is not meant for storing files, a development that could dent the appeal of the most valuable blockchain and slow down BTC demand leading to a permanent spike in its transaction levels.

While many feared a big sell-off, I see these upgrades as a catalyst for the ETH price. Liquid staking protocols like Rocket Pool and Lido Finance also stand to benefit. Overview Ethereum's ( ETH-USD ) most important transition, the Merge, followed by its much-anticipated upgrade, Shanghai, has been an enormous success. In this article, we will look at how the transition and upgrade could affect the Ethereum network, largely positively, in the long run. The Ethereum Evolution is Beyond Layer-2 Solutions Regardless of newly launched Layer-2 solutions to scale the Ethereum network and the success they've had, developers of the Ethereum network have not relented in upgrading the network to make it greener, faster, and more decentralized. The move from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) has made Ethereum energy efficient. Validators in the new PoS network have replaced miners-validators on the ETH network stake ETH. Staking also removes some of the ETH supply from circulation, making ETH deflationary. Shanghai is Upon Us The Shanghai upgrade is also referred to as Shapella by the Ethereum developer community. Shapella is a portmanteau of the words Shanghai and Capella. For clarity, the Shanghai upgrade takes effect on Ethereum's execution layer, while the Capella upgrade will be on the consensus layer. The Shanghai upgrade was completed on April 12, and the withdrawal of staked ETH and accrued rewards began. Over 18 million ETH ( $34.5 billion worth of ETH) staked on the Ethereum Beacon Chain network is expected to be unlocked over time. The total stacked ETH is approximately 18% of ETH's total circulating supply. On completion of the Shanghai upgrade, the first 3,902 ETH were withdrawn successfully, data from blockchain data and research firm Nansen reveals. According to Nansen's research, the withdrawal of staked ETH has been smooth since the Shanghai upgrade. Fear of a Sell-Off As the date for the Shanghai upgrade drew near, there was speculation of a sell-off of unlocked ETH that would create selling pressure and tank the price of ETH. However, since Shanghai, the price of ETH has steeply increased, crossing the $2,000 mark for the first time since August 2022. Instead of the speculated sell-off, more Beacon Chain validators are being created, as observed in on-chain data. For example, a wallet that has been inactive for over 2,000 days suddenly made a series of 30 separate 32-ETH transactions, staking a total of 960 ETH and creating 32 validators on Beacon Chain. The Shanghai upgrade and the smooth withdrawal process since the upgrade went live have increased the confidence of stakers in staking ETH and creating validators. A Boost for Liquid Staking The Shanghai upgrade has sparked lots of interest in crypto liquid staking - an advanced crypto staking service and a growing trend in decentralized finance (DeFi), in which stakers receive a liquid derivative of their staked token. In liquid staking, stakers stake tokens with a liquid staking provider. The staker then receives a derivative or a ""receipt,"" representing the staked token. The derivative token can be used on DeFi lending platforms as collateral for crypto loans and to leverage several yield opportunities in DeFi. These staking providers also allow users to stake as little as 0.01 ETH instead of the 32 ETH needed to become a validator. Liquid staking provides immediate liquidity for staked tokens. Liquid staking providers have seen growth in liquid staking since the Shanghai upgrade was completed. As the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, ETH's influence on the volume of liquid staking has been massive. Lido Finance ( LDO-USD ), a liquid staking solution for Ethereum and other top PoS cryptocurrencies, and Rocket Finance ( RPL-USD ), a decentralized Ethereum staking pool, experienced significant growth in January. From early 2021 to January 2023, the amount of ETH staked on these liquid staking platforms grew by 2,470% - an influence of Ethereum's move to PoS. Today, liquid staking providers account for over 30% of the total ETH staked . Technical Analysis Looking at the technical chart for Ethereum, I think that we are near the bottom of a sell-off, which should set us up for a rally into at least $2337. ETH TA (Author's work) This is where I'd expect the larger circle wave 3 to top. Before that, though, I'd expect ETH to fall in a wave C and test the 61.8% retracement of the latest move, which is at $1710. For some time, BTC has been outperforming the market, but if we enter altseason, we could see ETH perform much better in the coming weeks. Risk So far, the Shanghai upgrade and withdrawal of ETH have been smooth; the speculated unlock selling pressure has not negatively affected ETH's price since the upgrade. Instead of a mass withdrawal and sell-off of unlocked ETH, an additional 94,800 ETH (worth $198.7 million) were deposited for staking on the Ethereum network just days after the upgrade, according to data from Nansen. Nansen's data also show that ETH deposits have outpaced withdrawals. The net withdrawal of ETH after the Shanghai upgrade is about 66,000 ETH, while the net deposit sits at 100,000 ETH. This is very bullish for ETH. If deposits keep outpacing withdrawals in the coming weeks and months, we can say it's the dawn of a new era for the world's second-most-valued cryptocurrency and blockchain network. On the flip side, one criticism the Ethereum transition to PoS has drawn is the control of large staking pools by single entities like Coinbase (COIN), Binance (BNB-USD), Kraken, and Lido. The ""big four"" entities control over 50% of ETH's staking pools, hence over half of Ethereum network validators. This has raised concerns about the security and decentralization of the Ethereum network since it transitioned to PoS. Final Thoughts When all is said and done, the latest upgrade is a net positive for Ethereum. Users now have the flexibility to unstake/stake their holdings, and this will help regulate the supply, which should ultimately become slightly deflationary, which will help ETH appreciate.",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4598619-shapella-done-and-ethereum-still-here?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12272070.jpeg

12270394,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529421,1682970897,Sad Frogs: Why The Parabolic Pepe Coin Could Flatten By 80%,"Pepe coin, the meme cryptocurrency based on the popular internet meme, has become the newest sensation across crypto. Although it has made early buyers extremely happy – and extremely wealthy – it could soon leave many holders feeling flattened due to a possible 80% correction. Let’s take a closer look. Feels Good, Man… For Now What goes up, must come down. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. Regardless of the phrase you choose, there is a lesson related to Pepe possibly on the way. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying Few meme coins these days are a bigger deal than Pepe, rising from nothing to into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap in a little over two weeks since its launch. It’s vastly out-performed meme coin brethren Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, and the dozens of new coins that Pepe’s runaway success has spawned. But after an especially big rally of well over 400% in the last 48 hours, holders who bought he top could ultimately find out what it means to be a sad frog meme. The parabolic Pepe coin curve | PEPEUSDC on TradingView.com Predicting A Massive Pepe Coin Crash PEPEUSDC on Uniswap is one of the first charts to launch on TradingView with the largest amount of price data. Since the chart’s inception, it has brought investors 3,000% ROI. Earlier adopters turned $250 into a cool mil. Those who bought the top might be at risk of turning a million into lot less, considering the risk of a more than 80% correction. The risk is due to the parabolic curve pictured above breaking down violently. Related Reading: PEPE Goes To The Moon: Meme Coin Listed On OKX, Binance Listing In the Works? A rule of thumb in technical analysis is to expect at minimum an 80% retracement of a parabolic rally. Crypto holders would do well to remember that Peter Brandt famously called for an 80% collapse in Bitcoin after the 2017 peak. After that parabolic rally ended, BTCUSD dropped at full 84% from top to bottom before it was over. Brandt nailed the target over a year in advance. If Pepe coin has topped out after a 3,000% gain, a roughly 80% correction might be due. But much like Bitcoin then, after the correction, Pepe coin being such a new and hot coin should eventually bring substantial returns again. However, while the greater crypto market corrects, profit taking could aggressively spill into Pepe holders, who have a lot more room to fall compared to the rest of the market. As a result, things could get ugly quickly.

Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Retests Multi-Month Trend Line, Bulls Prevailing Again?

Despite selling some holdings, the individual still holds 2 trillion PEPE tokens, worth approximately $2.37 million at current market prices. If this investor were to sell their remaining meme coin tokens at the current market price, it could potentially profit approximately $4.14 million. Furthermore, a user using dimethyltryptamine.eth has made a significant profit investing in the cryptocurrency project. The user reportedly purchased 5.9 trillion PEPE tokens for the equivalent of 0.125 Ethereum, worth approximately $251.

Positioning crypto portfolios defensively is not an easy task. Sitting in stablecoins carries risk due to the collateral being held by centralized entities on traditional finance rails. Litecoin holders can stake LTC through THORFi savers vaults to generate 5.2% in-kind yield on unused coins without giving up control of funds. In a previous non-crypto article , I gave my rationale for why I suspect a recession is likely just around the corner. One of the more straightforward reasons that I can provide is that the Federal Reserve is now openly acknowledging a possible recession as well. Many of the traditional metrics that investors have paid attention to leading into a recession are flashing some warning signs. For the benefit of this specific article, I won't re-hash the entire thesis from my prior work. But the main points are as follows: The 10s minus 2s are deeply inverted We had two negative real GDP print quarters in 2022 Inflation adjusted retail sales peaked two years ago Consumer sentiment is horrid In my view, these factors taken together could certainly justify moving portfolios to more of a risk-off strategy. For crypto investors, this is something that should also be considered. The problem for market participants in this industry is we don't have a large amount of historical context to serve as a guide because most of these assets are less than 10 years old. Furthermore, the crypto response to the 2020 recession is unlikely to repeat unless there is a large and immediate pivot to easing from the central bank. While I won't get into the probability of that happening, I will say that there are things we can do within crypto rails to play defense. The Stablecoin Problem One of the simplest approaches crypto investors can take right now is allocating to stablecoins. There are several to choose from, but the overwhelming majority of them still require a centralized custodian that has traditional banking rails for collateralization. My personal preference is to not utilize those strategies because of the counterparty risk. Especially heading into a recession where financial institutions are potentially holding collateral that is underwater. USDC Peg (CoinMarketCap) In mid-March we saw how exposure to traditional banking rails could lead to significant problems in the crypto market when USDC ( USDC-USD ) briefly de-pegged by more than 10% . One of the most popular decentralized stablecoins is Dai ( DAI-USD ) and even that coin wasn't immune from the banking scare because it is collateralized by USDC to a large degree: DAI Collateral (Daistats) 40% of DAI's collateral backing is USDC. When USDC's peg broke, DAI's did too. While there are other decentralized stablecoins being developed on blockchains like Cardano ( ADA-USD ) that are very interesting, most of these coins are still experimental and subject to peg risks. Litecoin Is Still Solid Back in October I wrote what I felt was a strong contrarian take on Litecoin ( LTC-USD ). Litecoin is a proof-of-work fork of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) that many in the crypto investment community choose to ignore. My view since October has been that skipping over LTC out of some nonsensical Bitcoin zealotry is silly and diversification within crypto makes sense. Data by YCharts Not only is Litecoin up more than 65% since that article was published, but it's also the only top 10 layer one crypto that is beating BTC over the last 6 months. Much of what I talked about in that October article still applies today. It's still one of the most distributed coins in crypto and one of the most widely used for payments according to BitPay . 90 Day Adjusted NVT (CoinMetrics) From a pure network valuation standpoint, only ZCash ( ZEC-USD ) is cheaper from a 90 day adjusted NVT ratio standpoint. The question for Litecoin bulls is how do you manage your holdings in a recession if valuations in the broader market are elevated and you'd prefer to not swap back into fiat or other cryptocurrencies? You can adopt a staking strategy to generate yield without giving up control of your keys. How To Stake Litecoin Even though Litecoin is a proof of work blockchain, it is possible to deposit LTC and return in-kind yield. The most popular ways to do this have historically been through centralized entities like Celsius ( CEL-USD ) or Nexo ( NEXO-USD ). However, there are obvious drawbacks going with that approach and Celsius didn't survive crypto winter. Those depositors are still waiting for a portion of their funds back. Giving up control to a non-transparent, centralized custodian is not what I'm suggesting. THORChain ( RUNE-USD ) allows Litecoin holders to deposit LTC on-chain and earn in-kind yield through THORFi ""savers vaults."" These vaults differ slightly from THORChain LPs because the asset deposits don't require RUNE exposure to qualify for rewards: Savers Vaults are a pivotal innovation for THORChain and the first decentralized product to offer yield on native Bitcoin, and many other native assets. Users anywhere in the world can enter and exit THORChain Savers Vaults at will and earn yield without the need for wrapping, impermanent loss risk, or price exposure to multiple assets. The difference between staking collateral through a proof-of-stake chain and doing it through THORChain is PoS staking usually generates returns from token emissions while THORFi savers are more similar to LPs for THORChain swaps. Essentially the yield comes from fees that users pay when they swap between chains. This results in an APR that fluctuates but the yields can often be higher than US treasury bills. Asset Savers Depth Savers Filled Savers APR BTC $20.35M 100.68% 3.41% LTC $741.95K 54.45% 5.22% DOGE $224.61K 22.64% 7.46% BCH $203.95K 33.65% 4.30% Source: THORChain Explorer, PoW Coins For Litecoin specifically, the coin's annual inflation rate is currently 3.7%, which means the THORFi savers pool is currently generating a 1.5% real yield in the native asset if demand for the coin stays constant. This also doesn't take the halving into consideration. Much has been made about Bitcoin's halving which is roughly a year away. Litecoin also has an impending block reward halving but that halving is less than 100 days away. Following that event, the LTC annual rate of inflation will drop to 1.8%. Assuming the THORFi savers vaults' APR stays in line with current levels, LTC's THORFi real staking yield will jump to 3.4% in the native asset. Risks with THORFi Of course, yield doesn't come without trade-offs and one of the major risks inherent to any on-chain DeFi application is loss of funds through hot wallet phishing scams or a larger network hack. When providing liquidity through something like THORChain, the liquidity pools generate synthetic assets. What this means is when a user deposits LTC into THORFi savers vaults, what that user actually has is a claim on the LTC deposited rather than complete control of the original asset. The THORFI savers program is also variable rate. So as pool depth increases, the reward associated with staking through that pool could go down. Since the savers vaults are paying out swap fees to liquidity providers, more liquidity chasing less fees could also diminish the yield. Crypto Commodities There has been no shortage of instances lately of the Securities and Exchange Commission designating various cryptocurrencies as unregistered securities through enforcement actions. Despite Dash ( DASH-USD ) acting as a notable recent exception , the common thread that most of the SEC's securities designations share is the coins had an ICO and are native to proof of stake chains. Litecoin never had an ICO. In a recent lawsuit against Binance ( BNB-USD ), the CFTC claimed Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Litecoin are all commodities. While I think we're probably still quite a bit of time and litigation away from the US market getting better clarity on digital asset designations, it's difficult for me to imagine the SEC trying to argue LTC is an unregistered security since it's a proof of work coin with no centralized issuer and no initial coin offering. In the event the courts do find that a large majority of the crypto market coins are unregistered securities, it could position LTC fairly well as a digital commodity that is a cheaper alternative to Bitcoin. Summary This THORFi yield approach is not a strategy that everybody will want to do and it's also not a strategy that everyone will be able to do. The savers vaults have depth levels and program fill targets. The Litecoin vault is only 54% filled and has the second best yield of the PoW THORFi offerings. For a more defensive-themed cryptocurrency portfolio, finding safer yield opportunities without forfeiting keys is an attractive option. There aren't a lot of individual assets or asset classes that figure to perform well in a recession. Crypto is likely not an asset class that will have a lot of winners in a recession and that's if it has any winners at all. However, Litecoin specifically has a halving coming up in the very near future. It's a coin that has legitimate utility as a decentralized payment network. Long term crypto holders that don't want to convert back to fiat but that would like to position defensively can utilize THORFi savers to generate in-kind yield on LTC positions while they wait out a downturn.",NEUTRAL,BTC | LTC,BTC | FIAT | LTC | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4598579-crypto-recession-strategy-staking-litecoin?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12268895.jpeg

12268590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529383,1682965825,Bitcoin Bearish Signal: Miners Continue To Sell,"On-chain data shows that Bitcoin miners have continued to sell recently, a sign that can be bearish for the price of the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Miner Reserve Has Been Going Down Since Rally Started As an analyst in a CryptoQuant post pointed out, BTC miners have continued to shave coins off their reserve recently. The “miner reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Bitcoin that all miners are holding in their wallets currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Emerges As the King Of Assets,10X Growth Over Gold During US Banking Crisis When the value of this metric goes up, it means the miners are depositing a net number of coins into their wallets. This trend suggests these blockchain validators are accumulating the cryptocurrency. As miners are often a source of selling pressure in the market, their holding on and adding to their supply can be bullish for the price. On the other hand, a decreasing value in this indicator implies that miners are transferring some BTC out of their reserve. Since one of the main reasons why these investors may withdraw from their wallets is for selling-related purposes, such a trend can have bearish consequences for the asset’s value. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner reserve over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have gone down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant The above graph shows that the Bitcoin miner reserve saw a sharp plunge just as the rally began in January, suggesting that these investors sold to take advantage of the profit-taking opportunity. The drawdown in the metric was also quite sharp in this case and surpassed the levels seen during the FTX crash last November. The miner reserve has only moved sideways or down since this selloff, suggesting that these holders haven’t participated in any accumulation in recent months; they have only been looking at chances to exit. Recently, when Bitcoin plunged from the $30,000 mark, the indicator again saw a sharp leg down, meaning that this cohort was again selling their BTC. The drawdown in the indicator has also continued through the volatile price action observed in the last few days, suggesting that the BTC miners are still disposing of their coins. Though these investors may have been selling a net amount of coins recently, the actual scale of their selling isn’t that significant compared to their total reserve (they currently hold upwards of 1.82 million BTC in their wallets). Related Reading: Internet Computer (ICP) Social Dominance Hits 23-Month High, Top In? The quant notes, however, that the miners holding onto their coins for longer periods could be one of the crucial factors for the bullish trend’s health. It now remains to be seen whether these holders can reverse the trend anytime soon or if they will continue to sell Bitcoin in the short term. Either possibility is likely to have a profound effect on the BTC price. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $28,100, up 3% in the last week.

42393625,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1VbT,1682965339,Crypto Exchange Poloniex Agrees to $7.6M Fee to Settle Sanctions Violation Charges,"Poloniex LLC, a U.S. entity previously affiliated with the Poloniex crypto exchange, will remit $7.59 million to settle sanctions violations allegations with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC), the sanctions watchdog said Monday.  The platform had nearly 66,000 violations of various sanctions programs, allowing customers from Crimea, Cuba, Iran, Sudan and Syria to trade up to a collective $15 million between January 2014 and November 2019, OFAC said in a press release.  While Poloniex launched in January 2014, it did not have a sanctions compliance program in place until May 2015. The compliance program was also not retroactive, allowing customers from sanctioned jurisdictions who were already on the platform to continue using it, a Treasury document said.  ""Although Poloniex made efforts to identify and restrict accounts with a nexus to Iran, Cuba, Sudan, Crimea and Syria pursuant to its compliance program, certain customers apparently located in these jurisdictions continued to use Poloniex’s platform to engage in online digital asset-related transactions,"" OFAC said.  The Poloniex exchange is currently owned by a consortium of entities, which includes backing from Tron creator Justin Sun. Prior to that, U.S. crypto company Circle briefly owned Poloniex, though it sold the business after less than two years. Poloniex LLC appears to be the remaining U.S. legal entity after the sale of the exchange business.  Last year, the Poloniex exchange and fellow crypto exchange Huobi announced they would form a ""strategic partnership"" that would include boosting Huobi Token ""ecosystem development."" Sun is also an adviser to Huobi.  OFAC said in its report Monday the fact that Poloniex LLC ""was a small startup at the time of most of the"" alleged violations, and that Circle improved Poloniex's sanctions compliance program during its time owning the company were both mitigating factors in calculating how severe the penalty would be.  Both Circle and Poloniex cooperated with OFAC, which was another point in the exchange's favor, OFAC said.  A Poloniex spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment.

At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency has experienced a 3% decline in the last 24 hours and is currently trading at $28,400. However, it has now settled within an accumulation range of $27,800 to $30,000. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Community Destroys 3.26 Billion SHIB in April Amid Price Decline Bitcoin Bulls Take Caution BaroVirtual from Cryptoquant recently shared his analysis regarding the potential downside targets for Bitcoin. According to the analyst, the bearish divergence of the BTC: On-Chain Summation Index suggests a target of approximately $27.200. A Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern also indicates a lower range target of $25,000. The BTC on-Chain Summation Index is a metric that tracks the number of Bitcoin being transferred on the blockchain. When the index shows a bearish divergence, it suggests a decrease in the amount of Bitcoin being transferred, which could lead to a decline in price. On the same note, Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, received its largest single Bitcoin deposit in the past week. The deposit, made to an address that had remained inactive for four months, came from five separate addresses and totaled over 1,200 BTC, worth over $35M at current market prices. Arkham, a blockchain analytics firm that tracks cryptocurrency transactions, reported the news. The firm noted that the deposit was made in a single transaction and that the funds were sent to a previously unused deposit address. Will this translate into an extension of the bearish momentum? It remains to be seen. Moreover, according to Material Indicators, a crypto analytics firm, the recent Bitcoin monthly candle close/open has signaled a potential short-term price correction for the cryptocurrency. The firm’s Trend Precognition A2+ algo flashed a short signal, indicating a potential decline in Bitcoin’s price, as seen in the chart below. However, according to Material Indicators, the signal is tentative until the candle closes, and a pump above the April high could invalidate it. Additionally, Wednesday’s upcoming U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Federal Reserve interest rate decision could catalyze a significant price move in either direction. If the Federal Reserve raises interest rates by 25 basis points, it could lead to a stronger US dollar and put downward pressure on Bitcoin’s price. However, continuing to pause or maintain current rates could boost investor confidence and lead to a price increase for the cryptocurrency. Although the potential downside targets predicted for BTC, evidence suggests that the $27,000 mark could support the cryptocurrency and push back the bears. This level has already demonstrated its resilience as a support floor, holding up well against significant selling pressure since April 21st.

42393614,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bj1UwR,1682961437,Bitcoin Set New Record of Daily Transactions the Same Day the U.S. Government Quietly Engineered a Bank Buyout,"On Sunday, as the U.S. government worked behind the scenes with two major banks to engineer the latest financial rescue plan, the Bitcoin network hit a new all-time high for the number of daily transactions processed. There were more confirmed transactions than it ever had in its 14-year history, beating the previous record set during the 2017 bull run. Today, JPMorgan Chase has acquired First Republic after the distressed bank’s assets were seized by regulators, becoming the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history.  While the two events – Bitcoin’s surging use and the latest example of U.S. financial calamity – are not exactly related, the timing here does suggest something about the future of the crypto industry and bitcoin’s possible place in an evermore-dysfunctional economy. At the same time regulators and legislators are working to lessen crypto’s inroads into the wider economy, the private banking sector is showing itself to be unable to manage itself.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  After weeks of uncertainty and a slumping stock price, First Republic was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in a bid to prevent a possible bank run, further contagion and a drawdown of the insurance fund’s reserves. The federal banking watchdog immediately sold “all of [First Republic’s] deposits and substantially all of [its] assets” to JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, which was also provided $50 billion in financing to complete the deal. Democratic politicians are likely to challenge the sale, which was reportedly rushed through to close before markets opened on Monday.  “Our government invited us and others to step up, and we did,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said. Crypto fans may know Dimon as one of the highest-profile advocates of “blockchain” and long-time bitcoin critic. First Republic’s failure is second only to Washington Mutual, which failed during the Great Financial Crisis that also gave rise to bitcoin. While some amount of blame could be put on First Republic’s management, economists are largely aligned in thinking its collapse is at least partially due to rising interest rates and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy that also brought down the Silvergate, Silicon Valley and Signature banks early this year.  Where this situation aligns with bitcoin in particular is that the crypto industry is part and parcel of a wider political realignment towards populism. Crypto is not the only movement challenging the authority of central banks and established powers, as many people will see the First Republic bailout as another example of profits being privatized while losses are socialized. In trying to prevent a massive drawdown on FDIC reserves, political operators have essentially said that all U.S. banks are too big to fail – a type of moral quandary that protects a certain class from the consequences of their decisions.  See also: Peter McCormack – Balaji Srinivasan's $1M Bitcoin Bet Could Be Right, but I Hope He's Wrong | Opinion  Bitcoin has emerged as an alternative monetary system, which many think could eventually serve as a legitimate global reserve currency like the U.S. dollar is today. The system is attractive to some because it follows prewritten rules, including a fixed monetary issuance schedule set by social consensus (unlike the political and monied interests that rule the greenback). Bitcoin’s price rose steadily during the last cycle of banking failures, and might also catch a wave up this time. This doesn’t necessarily mean bitcoin is a “hedge” against financial calamity, or that people are choosing “trustless” financial systems over increasingly untrustworthy banks.  The timing of the Bitcoin blockchain’s latest milestone is purely incidental. Bitcoin transactions have been trending up since the launch of Bitcoin Ordinals, which enabled the network to support non-fungible tokens (NFT). More than 2.39 million Ordinals have been “inscribed” to date, according to Glassnode’s data cited by Blockworks. But, even though Bitcoin NFTs now account for roughly half of the transactions on the network (rewarding bitcoin miners with increased transaction fees, and potentially helping secure Bitcoin’s long-term “security budget”), not all bitcoiners are aligned in thinking this is a worthwhile feature.

According to a report by on-chain analytics provider Glassnode, “Bitcoin daily transaction counts are approaching All-time-highs, seeing an explosive uptick in 2023.’ Regardless of this news, Bitcoin has continued to move downward after its weekend plateau of trading at just between $29,300. The asset trading volume has also surged slightly indicating a possible violent sell-off. Bitcoin Records Daily Transactions Nearing Peak Levels According to Glassnode, on the 30-day moving average, Bitcoin daily transactions have reached an amount of 348,700. While the peak level which was seen in 2017 remains at 379,000 transactions per day. This has proved Bitcoin’s daily transactions are beginning to near the all-time high last seen about 5 years ago. Furthermore, according to the Glassnode report, this surge in Bitcoin daily transactions is thanks to the Ordinal inscriptions. The Ordinal inscriptions also known as Bitcoin non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or Ordinals, are inscriptions (digital artifacts) inscribed on satoshis (sats) – little units of Bitcoin. Glassnode noted the inscription accounts for approximately 30% to 40% of mined transactions and 10% to 20% of fees paid. Meanwhile, the remaining majority of transactions are monetary in nature, frequently conducted through exchanges. According to Glassnode, compared to Ordinals activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, BTC exchange activity is relatively low, representing roughly 30% of fees and transactions. The trend of creating inscriptions initially gained popularity in February when users started inscribing NFTs on satoshis. However, the recent resurgence has been dominated by inscriptions that are based on text. Glassnode noted: Bitcoin transaction counts, address activity, Inscriptions, and Mempool congestion are all elevated. As is the degree of HODLing, and supply acquired below $30k. Conviction remains. BTC Continues Downtrend Bitcoin (BTC) is yet to make any significant move in the past few days. Instead, it has only seemed to pick up from where it left off in its downward trend in recent weeks. Over the past 24 hours, the top crypto has plummeted nearly 4% with a market price of $28,435, at the time of writing. This downtrend follows a notable fall from the $30,000 region in recent weeks. So far, Bitcoin has a 24-hour range between a low of $28,315 and a high of $29,944. Meanwhile, the BTC market cap is still in the green while its trading volume signals selling pressure, indicating a possible continuous bearish trend. Over the past week, Bitcoin’s market capitalization has surged from a low of $528 billion on April 24 to as high as $550 billion as of today. Its trading volume has also spiked from a daily trading volume of $15.4 billion to $19.8 billion, over the same time period.

Called Blend, short for Blur Lending, the platform is intended to allow traders to maximize NFT liquidity by allowing buyers to put up collateral for their token purchases. This will enable new buyers to enter the ecosystem who were previously priced out of expensive collections like Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunk NFTs.  Just as home buyers put a down payment on a property and then pay a mortgage, Blur said Blend will allow collectors to apply the same principles to NFT markets – they can put up a percentage of the full NFT price and finance the remaining balance.  Blur posted a Twitter thread sharing the details of the product, explaining how the product will help open opportunities for lenders and borrowers seeking to enter the market.  “Every trillion dollar market relies on financialization to scale,” said Blur in a tweet. “Many may want to buy into a collection, but very few can afford to pay it all at once. The solution is NFT lending.”  Blur said the product was created in collaboration with Dan Robinson, head of research at venture capital firm Paradigm and investor in decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap version (v)3, alongside pseudonymous research associate Transmissions, who has previously contributed to building the marketplace protocol Seaport. Paradigm is the lead investor in Blur.  According to the thread, Blend will have no fees for traders or lenders, pushing the Blur brand further into the world of decentralized finance (DeFi).  “Blend is a flexible and permissionless floating-rate lending protocol that can support arbitrary collateral with no oracle dependencies, and allows whatever interest rates and loan-to-value ratios the market will bear,” reads the Blend white paper. “We're excited to see how people use it!”  Blend comes to Blur near the end of Season 2, the airdrop period of $300 million worth of its native BLUR token.

12264001,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529369,1682953232,"Chainlink (LINK) Price Falls Below $7, Are The Bears Back In Control?","The bearish trend a few days ago brought Chainlink (LINK) down to $6.735 on April 26. The bulls tried to recover and drove the price of LINK to a solid 24-hour high of $7.30, but it later fell to a 7-day low of $6.773. Due to the current FUD and increased regulatory pressure in the United States, Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped below $29,000. But if the bulls build strong momentum, BTC may test $30k and climb higher, dragging the rest of the altcoin market, including LINK, with it. Will Bearish Trend Continue? As of the time of writing, the LINK market is still moving down, falling by 2.49% to $7.06. According to CoinMarketCap info, LINK’s market cap decreased by 3.11%, while its 24-hour trading volume rose by 30.83% during the downtrend. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying The increasing trading volume suggests a possible change in investors’ sentiment for LINK. It indicates that network activities are increasing despite the downturn, which might push the LINK price to a rally. However, if more traders attempt to sell their holdings, a market sell-off may occur, potentially adding to downward pressure on the price. Notably, due to the ongoing Spring 2023 hackathon, long-term holders stopped selling. This recent event might draw new network players and start a long-lasting bull movement. LINK Technical Analysis LINK has seen a few rejections at the supply zone of $7.50 in the past few days, which is also the primary resistance zone. On April 30, the LINK price hit the resistance zone and went down, which attracted the bears. Chainlink trades between support and resistance levels of $6.773 and $7.500. The first significant resistance level for LINK is $7.500. The following resistance zone is $8.831 if the price moves above this current zone. But if the bears build strong momentum, the next support will be $5.492. Related Reading: Pepe Coin’s Mega Rise Pinned To This Smart Contract Fix The market is down due to a change in market structure caused by the 50-day SMA change in direction. If the bullish momentum doesn’t pick up, the trend may change to a potential bearish market. The 50-day SMA established a Death Cross by crossing below the 200-day SMA, indicating a potentially bearish signal and suggesting a selling opportunity. At the time of analysis, the RSI is 40.86 below the neutral zone. Therefore, this shows that LINK is not in the overbought zone but seems to be heading toward the oversold zone. The bears are aggressively pushing the price of LINK to the oversold zone while the bulls are still trying to hold the market, even though the momentum is weak. The MACD is currently trading below the signal line, showing bearish sentiment in the market.

The most well-known digital token ( BTC-USD ) slid 3.3% to $28.45K at 10:43 a.m. ET, once again rejecting the key $30K technical level, despite renewed concerns about the traditional regional banking sector. Other major token also took a hit, namely ethereum ( ETH-USD ), slumping 3.6% to $1.84K, and solana ( SOL-USD ), -5.5% . The bearish price action sent crypto-tied stocks lower, including Riot Platforms ( NASDAQ: RIOT ), -5.9% , Marathon Digital ( NASDAQ: MARA ), -5.5% , CleanSpark ( NASDAQ: CLSK ), -5.5% , Core Scientific ( OTCPK:CORZQ ), -5.2% , MicroStrategy ( NASDAQ: MSTR ), -4.1% , and Coinbase Global ( NASDAQ: COIN ), -1.8% . The moves come as investors brace for Wednesday's FOMC gathering. With core inflation showing signs of stickiness and the labor market still going strong, fed funds futures priced in a 91.2% chance that monetary policymakers will lift the benchmark rate by another 25 basis points, according to the CME FedWatch tool , taking the target range to 5.0%-5.25%. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, contended that this could be the last rate increase, ""or the last for awhile, if the Fed chooses to sit back and evaluate inflation, the state of the economy, and the cumulative impact of all the rate hikes.” “The continued strength of the labor market and slower-than-hoped moderation in inflation pressures underscore the case for the Fed raising interest rates again on May 3,"" he said. ""The Fed has sown a credibility issue on inflation and the way to dispel that is to see the job of restoring price stability through.” More on Crypto Bitcoin on track for over 7% weekly gain amid renewed banking woes Bitcoin: A Flash Crash And A Look At The Fundamentals Sell Bitcoin In May And Go Away (Until It Crosses This Moving Average)",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/news/3962655-crypto-linked-stocks-slide-as-bitcoin-retreats-to-below-29k?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12263693.jpeg

These figures are lower than the total SHIB burns in March 2023, which was 6.78 billion SHIB tokens burned through 540 transactions. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying The SHIB burn process involves sending Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens to an address known as a “burn address.” This address is a designated address created to hold the tokens to be burned permanently. The Shiba Inu community carried out these burn transactions to reduce the total supply of SHIB in circulation. Notably, a token’s scarcity sees demand higher than supply leading to a boost in price. Despite the high number of token burns, SHIB’s price is still declining. Koyo Retains Top SHIB Burner Status From March 2023 Koyo (KYO) retains its top SHIB burner status for a second consecutive month burning a whopping 2.59 billion tokens. It burnt 6.15 billion SHIB tokens in March 2023 through multiple transactions. The largest of its burn transactions in March was a transfer of 924.15 million SHIB to the dead wallet on March 17. Also, Koyo burned another 794.85 million tokens on March 28. Koyo continued its aggressive burn rate in April 2023, sending 1.10 billion SHIB to the dead wallet on April 9. Also, Koyo followed up with another massive burn event on April 14, burning 1.49 billion SHIB tokens. However, the burns didn’t affect Shiba Inu’s value as the token’s price is still down by over 2% in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Pepe Coin’s Mega Rise Pinned To This Smart Contract Fix The current price slump could be a temporary pullback due to the recent market downtrend. One thing that could change the trajectory of the price is the Shibarium upgrade, which is yet to be announced. Shiba Archives said a top SHIB developer claimed the Shibarium upgrade would be here before May. However, the developer did not specify the year or give further information. Notably, some SHIB community members reacted to the reduced burn rates in April 2023. A Twitter user, Macguy, stated that the developers don’t want to listen to the SHIB community‘s calls for more burns. He believes the burns are slow and dragged on purpose, announcing that he did his part by burning 10 million SHIB tokens. Shiba Inu Price Analysis SHIB is in a downtrend today, dropping below its support level of $0.0000102. Also, it is trading below its 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA), a bearish sentiment for the short and long term. SHIB’s resistance levels are $0.0000118, $0.000012, and $0.0000113 as it is currently trading at $0.00000996. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 36.26 and descending into the oversold region of 30. SHIB will likely experience further price decline in the coming days. However, the $0.00000973 support will prove critical and can act as a price pivot for a recovery.

The fundraise comes ahead of the ecosystem and native token launch on Ethereum layer 2 blockchain Arbitrum later this year.  Arbitrum was recently at the center of one of the most-hyped events in recent memory: an airdrop of its long-awaited ARB token to early builders, users and investors. The event came with some controversy related to the Arbitrum DAO prematurely moving nearly $1 billion of the tokens to the Arbitrum Foundation before a vote on how to use the funds had finished.  The FARE ecosystem is built on probability smart contracts, which are triggered by transparent on-chain events based on probability variables. The first use case for the contracts is randomized minting and burning (or “winning” and “losing”) of the FARE token. The system is designed so the probability of losing or burning a token is higher than minting or winning, similar to how a real-world casino operates. Instead of a centralized “house"" getting the profits, the value is passed along to FARE holders through token deflation.  Other investors in the round included 6th Man Ventures, Arrington Capital, Eniac Ventures, Spark Digital Capital, Morningstar Ventures, Quantstamp and DWeb3, among others.

Related Reading: Terra Classic Recent Efforts Could Benefit LUNC’s Growth Potential Contract Deployment Spike Could Boost AVAX Adoption According to the latest CoinMarketCap data, Avalanche (AVAX) has experienced a minor 2.04% dip in its price over the last 24 hours, but still remains relatively steady at $17.04. Despite this slight setback, data from Artemis reveals that the network has witnessed a significant spike in contract deployment, which can be a positive indicator for the protocol’s usage and adoption. The contract deployment of $AVAX has recently hit its highest levels in over six months. After analyzing the on-chain activity, we found that contract deployment hasn’t seen such growth since May 2022. pic.twitter.com/ehkVk7ZrrK — Artemis 🏹 (@Artemis__xyz) April 28, 2023 The increase in the number of smart contracts deployed on the Avalanche network suggests that more developers are building dApps and exploring the potential of the platform. As the number of dApps on the network grows, it can lead to a wider range of use cases for the protocol, attracting more users and projects. This increased adoption and usage can ultimately drive up demand for AVAX. If the trend of contract deployment continues to rise, it could be a sign of a healthy and growing ecosystem on Avalanche. This, in turn, can further boost the token’s value. Avalanche Network TVL. Image: Defillama Avalanche’s DeFi Performance Disappoints Despite a significant increase in smart contract deployment on the Avalanche network, the platform’s performance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector has been less than stellar. Recent data shows a sharp decline in the platform’s decentralized exchange (DEX) volume, falling from 311 million to 13.74 million in just a few months. This has had a direct impact on Avalanche’s total value locked (TVL), which has also seen a decline. One of the contributing factors to the decline in Avalanche’s DeFi performance has been the decreasing interest in BTC.b, a wrapped Bitcoin token on the network used for DeFi purposes. According to data from Dune Analytics, all DEXes on the Avalanche network have witnessed a decline in BTC.b usage, indicating a lack of interest in the platform’s DeFi offerings.

12261742,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529345,1682946619,"Solana (SOL) Retests Multi-Month Trend Line, Bulls Prevailing Again?","Sunday night’s crypto market-wide correction has once again sent the Solana price down to a level that is crucial for price action in the coming weeks. SOL has been forming an ascending trend line on the 1-day chart since late December last year, which could lead the price back into bullish territory, as NewsBTC reported. Already in the last few days, the Solana price had tested the trend line (black) before a decent bounce to the upside took place. However, yesterday’s price action pushed SOL back to the trendline. However, as the 4-hour chart shows, SOL has shown strength and remained above the trendline. The retracement has also caused Solana’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) to reset on the 4-hour chart. With the RSI near the overbought zone at 68, there has now been a healthy pullback to 41. Thus, the 4-hour chart continues to look bullish. A look at the 1-hour chart continues to show a similarly strong picture. For SOL’s bulls, today is all about closing above the $22 level to stay above the trendline. If successful, the bulls can once again tackle resistance at $22.78 before the big challenge: the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) (blue). Solana already fell below the “bull line” on April 8, 2022, which technically means it is still in bear territory. The collapse of FTX and the entanglements are certainly one reason why SOL is still undervalued compared to other altcoins. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Price Holds Ultra Strong, Bulls Target $25 Today? While numerous altcoins are already trading above the 200-day EMA, the indicator remains the most important target for Solana. However, this will likely require a renewed upswing in the overall crypto market, especially in the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Once the 200-day EMA falls, Solana’s yearly high at $27.13 comes into focus, where the 38.2% Fibonacci level is also located. Subsequent Fibonacci levels would be $33.06 (50% Fibonacci), $39.14 (61.8%Fibonacci), and $47.81 (78.6% Fibonacci). Related Reading: Solana Faces A Trend Decision, But The Bull Case Prevails Remarkably, Solana’s current strength can also be seen in the SOL/BTC chart (1-day chart).

12260502,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529327,1682942823,"Internet Computer (ICP) Social Dominance Hits 23-Month High, Top In?","Data shows the Internet Computer (ICP) social dominance has hit a 23-month high, a sign that a local top may be here for the cryptocurrency. Internet Computer Investors Are Showing Signs Of Euphoria According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, a large number of investors are talking about ICP following its recent bullish momentum. A relevant indicator here is the “social volume,” which measures the total number of social media text documents that contain mentions of a given asset. The text documents here refer to a collection of data assembled by Santiment that includes posts and messages from social media websites like Reddit, Telegram, and Twitter. This indicator only gauges the unique mentions of the asset in question, meaning that even if a forum post includes the term several times, its contribution towards the social volume still remains one unit. Now, “social dominance” is a metric that compares the social volume of the given cryptocurrency with that of the top 100 assets (by market cap) combined. Here, the coin of interest is Internet Computer, so what this metric tells is how much of the discussion on the Internet related to cryptocurrencies, in general, includes the topic of ICP. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the ICP social dominance over the last year: Looks like the value of the metric has been pretty high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As shown in the above graph, the Internet Computer social dominance has observed a very sharp spike recently as the price of the asset has shown some bullish momentum. This latest uptrend in the asset’s value has been quite extraordinary when compared to the rest of the market, as most of the cryptocurrencies have only shown a flat movement or a decline in the same period. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Rejects $30K But This Variable Can Trigger A Fresh Increase Rapid upwards momentum like this can bring a lot of eyes toward an asset, and so, discussions about it naturally follow on social media. Because of this reason, it’s not unexpected that the ICP social dominance has shot up during this period of bullish divergence from the rest of the sector. From the chart, it’s visible that the metric saw a large spike of similar scale only a week or so before this latest surge, and this spike too occurred as Internet Computer enjoyed some rapid rise. Shortly after this previous spike in social dominance took place, however, the price topped above the $7 level as the bullish momentum petered out. Generally, whenever there is a sharp rise in discussions around an asset during price surges, it’s a sign that euphoria may be building among investors. Historically, such market conditions have led to an increased possibility for the price to form a top. Internet Computer may have hit a local high during the past spike due to this reason. As the latest surge in discussions around ICP is even higher in value than the previous instance, it’s possible that the coin may be at risk of declining currently.

After the substantial transfer made in trueUSD (TUSD) got flagged by Whale Alert early Monday, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao took to Twitter to say his platform has warned Sun it will take action if he used any of the funds to buy up large amounts of SUI tokens from Binance's Launchpool.  ""Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales,"" Zhao said.  The SUI token, the native token of layer1 blockchain Sui, is set to take place once the mainnet goes live on May 3. On Sunday, Binance announced the SUI token will be available via its Launchpool, which allows users to stake their crypto assets to provide funds into a liquidity pool and get rewards in return.  Sun replied to Zhao's post saying his team was not fully aware of the ""intended purpose"" of the funds, which he says is used to ""facilitate market-making between leading TUSD exchanges, thereby enhancing liquidity and trading volume, rather than participating in any exchange promotions.""  ""Upon realizing this error, we immediately contacted the exchange team and arranged for a full refund of the funds,"" Sun tweeted.  Later Monday, Binance tweeted it would reallocate the market maker's 278,752 farmed SUI tokens to its platform's TUSD liquidity pool at 00:00 UTC on May 2.

Three key takeaways about cryptocurrencies. Winners and when. I recently had the opportunity to attend a two-day conference in Sarasota, Florida hosted by the Global Interdependence Center. The topic was Cryptocurrency and the Future of Global Finance . Given that it included some of the leading research and analysts on cryptocurrencies along with an address from Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Christopher Waller, the event provided a substantive education on a burgeoning segment of capital markets that is otherwise overrun with noise and conjecture. It was a worthwhile and enlightening experience. My own basic views on cryptocurrencies to this point have been the following. The advent of the blockchain and the supported cryptocurrency systems are almost undoubtedly transformative. The fact that cryptocurrencies have experienced two successive major asset price bubbles first in 2017 and again 2021 is evidence of meaningful future potential in the same way that the dot com bubble of the late 1990s heralded how the Internet would change the way we live our lives in the more than two decades since. But from where we stand today, several key questions linger. How exactly will cryptocurrencies be transformative, and over what future time horizon will any such changes play out? Also, how will the winners and losers be determined along the way? The following were some of the key takeaways from the conference: Moves like Apple . While cryptocurrencies are often perceived as potentially viable alternatives to the fiat currencies such as the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen among many others that we have come to know so well over the years, they don’t behave as such at least to date. This is also true of the traditional global alternative reserve currencies like gold, as the historical price relationship is generally weak. StockCharts.com Instead, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD) move with a very high correlation to the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index ( QQQ ). StockCharts.com So instead of owning something that many might perceive will provide them with a differentiated and more diversified returns experience for their broader “asset” portfolio, those that have added cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are taking on a risk that is effectively doubling down on the exposures they likely already maintain through holdings in technology stocks. This is true even for those investors that might perceive they are getting something different to complement their S&P 500 allocation, as a historically high percentage at more than one-third of the headline benchmark is weighted to Information Technology or tech-adjacent sectors such as Communications (that contains former tech juggernauts Alphabet (nee Google) and Meta Platforms (nee Facebook)) and Consumer Discretionary (that contains heavy dollops of Amazon and Tesla). Put simply, the investors that are crypto curious are often those that tilt toward greater risk and more aggressive equity allocations. And for those that follow through and allocate to crypto, they are effectively ending up with more of the same piece from a portfolio allocation perspective. Disruptive innovation . In many respects, cryptocurrency remains an instrument for speculators seeking to ride the waves of liquidity that have flooded through capital markets in recent years. After all, it is not widely used as a medium of exchange and it does not represent a reliable store of value in any meaningful way. But as we move forward into the future, it is reasonable to wonder about the path of disruptive innovation for cryptocurrencies to ultimately attain this more widespread viability and acceptance. In other words, what should we really be watching in monitoring the progress of cryptocurrency? First, the path to long-term viability is not likely to happen at the high end of the market. What does this mean? It’s not likely that we wake up one day and Bitcoin is replacing the U.S. Dollar as the way we buy groceries at the market here in America. Why? Because we in the United States are already catered to in many ways. We have the global reserve currency and an overall market system that works pretty smoothly barring the occasional hiccup. Sure, we’ve had some high inflation recently, but it’s not like it’s resulted in a sense of chaos or chronic uncertainty. The same is true for a more middling case like El Salvador. Here’s a frontier market that made the bold move to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. But in unfortunate yet classic top ticking the market fashion, the launch of the Chivo electric wallet in October 2021 took place almost to the date when Bitcoin was reaching its peak over $68,000. Since that time, of course, the cryptocurrency dropped in value by more than -75%. In short, too big of a move way too early. So where does cryptocurrency find its path to legitimacy? The same way as nearly all disruptive innovations have, which is gaining more widespread usage and acceptance in lower end segments of the global marketplace that are being largely overlooked where profitability is the least and where the need for new ways of doing things like transactions systems is greatest. It is in these low-end segments where the opportunity is greatest for cryptocurrencies to gain widespread acceptance and essentially work out the kinks in broadening actual implementation. As they stabilize and improve, these cryptocurrencies can then start working their way upmarket to more established and developed economies to expand their presence. This is the most likely path for cryptocurrencies going forward, and it is disruptively innovative transformation that is not going to happen overnight. Instead, it is a gradual evolution that will likely take a good deal of time measured in many years if not a decade or more to play out. Like Amazon and Priceline . We have more than 24,000 cryptocurrencies in existence today. And just like the many dot com stocks that came and went during the late 1990s and early 2000s, it is likely that the vast majority of these cryptocurrencies will follow the same path into extinction in the coming years. What cryptocurrencies then are the likely survivors into the long-run the same way that we still use the services of major companies like Amazon and Booking Holdings (nee Priceline) today? The consensus view of the experts at the conference is that while others may continue forward into the future, two cryptocurrencies were likely to be the primary survivors into the long-term. The first is Bitcoin due to its size dominance as well as its applicability from a transactions systems standpoint. The second is Ethereum (ETH-USD) due to its applicability for more specialized applications and contracts. As a result, these two cryptocurrencies are useful leading proxies for monitoring the broader space for those that may wish to incorporate the monitoring of these assets into their broader asset allocation research. Bottom line . From an investment perspective, we are likely still several years off from realistically even starting to consider including cryptocurrencies in the context of broader asset allocation modeling. Nonetheless, cryptocurrencies have been evolving for more than a decade now, and this evolution is likely to continue going forward as this pioneering market segment increasingly finds its footing and path toward long-term viability. What that looks like at the end of the day remains to be seen, but it remains worth monitoring as it develops in identifying the associated opportunities once that day arrives. And the insights gained from the recent Global Interdependence Center conference in Sarasota, Florida were ideal in better understanding and focusing this monitoring process going forward.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4598425-path-forward-for-cryptocurrency?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12257587.jpeg

The order is the latest in a string of enforcement actions and heavy fines by the securities regulator that has forced some firms to shutter all or part of their operations.  The SEC alleged Bergquist and Up Global worked to obtain UpToken supply ""that would substantially reduce Coinme's need to purchase UpToken"" following the ICO, leading to ""publicly inflated amounts raised.""  To settle the charges, Up Global agreed to pay a $3,520,000 penalty, while Coinme agreed to pay a separate $250,000 penalty and Bergquist agreed to pay $150,000, according to the regulator.  ""The SEC order also bars Bergquist, for a period of three years, from acting as an officer or director of a public company,"" the announcement said.  Coinme has bitcoin ATMs in around 49 U.S. states and added a range of popular crypto tokens to its grocery store kiosks in August.  CoinDesk has reached out to Coinme for comment.

12256916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=529329,1682931931,"Here’s What PEPE And SHIB Have In Common, But Can It Catch Up To Shiba Inu?","The meme coin PEPE is currently experiencing a spectacular rise that hardly any other altcoin, apart from Shiba Inu, has experienced. Within just two weeks, the meme coin, which is based on a cartoon character created by Matt Furie back in 2005, has (almost) broken into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap. At press time, PEPE was ranked #101. And as on-chain analytics platform Nansen shared in a recent analysis, the two meme coins share other similarities: namely, numerous holders. According to Nansen, PEPE has more than 54,000 holders after just two weeks. While this sounds impressive, it is still small compared to the 1.3 million Shiba Inu holders. Every 16th PEPE Holder Also Owns SHIB It is worth noting, however, that one in 16 PEPE holders also owns Shiba Inu (SHIB). As Nansen analyzed, there are over 3,350 wallets holding both meme coins. So before PEPE can even come close to competing with SHIB, the holder base will have to expand substantially. 54,000+ $PEPE holders in just 2 weeks? 🤯 Impressive, but let's not forget the 1.3 million $SHIB holders out there! And did you know that over 3,350 wallets hold both memecoins? Let's dive into the top holders of these two 👇 pic.twitter.com/VmJPdJZQEY — Nansen 🧭 (@nansen_ai) April 30, 2023 An analysis of the largest holders shows that the two exchanges MEXC and Gate hold large amounts of both memecoins. “But did you know Wintermute also has 2 contract addresses trading both tokens?” notes Nansen. Wintermute is a leading global crypto market maker that works with the world’s top crypto exchanges and projects to provide liquidity. Wintermute has an estimated on-chain valuation of $230 million, with Arbitrum ($54 million), Optimism ($47 million) and DYDX ($32 million) being the largest holdings. Related Reading: Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying Nansen also writes, “Keep in mind that this wallet holds over $37.8 million in tokens, the majority of which are WETH, WBTC and stablecoins, so $SHIB and $PEPE only make up a tiny percentage of their portfolio.” However, Wintermute actively trades both meme coins. Wintermute’s address first received 1.2 billion SHIB on Feb. 23 with a current balance of 15.2 billion. Remarkably, the account was actively trading on the chain with a realized PnL (DEX trades) between -$46,300 and $53,700. It also frequently sends SHIB to its exchange deposit addresses. Related Reading: Pepe Coin’s Mega Rise Pinned To This Smart Contract Fix But not only SHIB, PEPE is also actively traded by the Wintermute address. It first received 46.5 billion PEPE on April 20 and currently has a balance of 81.6 billion. The address has a realized PnL (DEX trades) between -$87,000 (on 4/21) and $170,000 (today). Its last transaction was the exchange of 5,200,712,114 PEPE for 1.67 WETH. Remarkably, PEPE’s 24-hour trading volume already outperformed SHIB by a factor of two, according to data by CoinGecko. Within the last day, PEPE reached $257.8 million, compared to $131.6 million for Shiba Inu. PEPE About To Break Into The Top 100 PEPE has risen over 93% in the last 24 hours, reaching an all-time high of $0.000001158. The market cap has risen to over $435.9 million, bringing the meme coin to 101st place on Coingecko. However, as NewsBTC Can Meme Coin PEPE Get Into The Top 100? Read This Before Buying, there are some red flags. As quickly as PEPE’s price has risen, it could fall again. More than 20 wallets spent an amount of about 0.02 ETH on Fixed Float and Changenow to buy the new meme coin shortly after PEPE started trading. Now these PEPE are worth several million dollars. It has not yet been conclusively determined whether these are insiders. However, analysts warn that potential buyers should keep an eye on these addresses to avoid a rug pull, especially because the creators are unknown. At press time, the PEPE price stood at $0.00000109139.

Fears that the US government was liquidating BTC turned out to be false. The fundamental setup for BTC is mixed. DAUs remain near 2023 highs and fees are again spiking, some of which is due to Ordinals NFTs. However, net exchange flow and NVT ratio are both flashing warning signs. In one of the more bizarre intraday price moves we've seen in the crypto market in a while, it was the stairs up and the elevator down for Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on Wednesday. Bulls and bears both took it on the chin at various points during the session. First, bulls pushed the price up to $30,000 from a Tuesday close of $28,300. BTC 1hr Chart (TradingView) Then late in the Wednesday session BTC's dollar price crashed more than 8% in about a 90 minute timeframe from $29,700 down to $27,200 before somewhat amusingly closing the Wednesday session back at $28,400. In the process, more than $2.5 billion in open interest was wiped out during that single elevator candle. What Caused That? There was quite a bit of speculation that the dump was caused by a rumor-related panic sell following a $26.6 million BTC deposit to Binance by market maker Jump Trading. This deposit was alerted via Twitter by chain analysis company Arkham Intelligence and was in close proximity to a false alert that the US Federal Government was actively selling seized BTC holdings from the Silk Road confiscations. That alert was attributed to Arkham. US Gov BTC Holdings (Dune Analytics/21Shares) That turned out to not be true as the US Government's balance is still well over 205k BTC and hasn't budged since early March. Arkham's explanation online was that the alert did indeed happen but that it was improperly configured at the user end by a well-followed crypto news account on Twitter. The account then shared that incorrect information online. Onlookers falsely attributed the decline in BTC's price to Jump Trading reacting to the Arkham Silk Road funds alert, when it in actuality Jump's deposit was an hour earlier. The end result was a very volatile Wednesday session that closed roughly breakeven, but not before traders lost billions in the process. Network Metrics As far as the actual activity on the network is concerned, Bitcoin's usage has remained stable in recent weeks and we're seeing that activity reflected through a generally positive trend in daily active users: Active Addresses (Messari) DAUs on the main layer have oscillated between 800k and 1 million over the last several weeks. Raw transaction figures have increased in recent days according to data from IntoTheBlock. However, despite the increase in total transactions, the BTC volume of the transactions has remained low compared to 2022 levels. BTC Transaction Volume (IntoTheBlock) After cooling off for much of April, there has been a noticeable jump in daily fees over the last couple of days: BTC Daily Fees (Token Terminal) In my opinion, this is likely attributable to another increase in Ordinals mints. Adoption of Bitcoin's controversial NFT project Ordinals continues to make new daily inscription highs. There have now been over 2 million NFTs minted with Bitcoin's block space since that project launched a few months ago. Ordinals Daily Mints (Dune Analytics/dgtl_assets) However, what's been different about this recent surge higher in Ordinals mints has been the lack of a surge in transaction fees up until the last couple of days. Ordinals Fees (Dune Analytics/dgtl_assets) We can see from the chart above that daily fees paid to inscribe Ordinals fell from a peak of $375k on March 24th down to just $8.8k on April 20th. This recent pop in daily inscriptions has resulted in more fee revenue than was apparent during the early April inscription highs. Other Considerations Another important metric to consider when guessing where the BTC price is going in the short to medium term is exchange flows. Typically when exchange flow is net negative, it means buyers are accumulating and taking assets into self-custody. Conversely, when exchange net flow is positive, it could be a sign that holders are looking to take profit. Exchange Net Flows 1 Month (IntoTheBlock) According to data provided by IntoTheBlock, aggregated exchange flows have been positive by nearly 76k BTC since the start of April. That represents $2.2 billion in positive net flow over the last 27 days. I'd call that a fairly bearish development for the short term. 90 Day NVT (CoinMetrics) Something else that I often point to when I look at these more payment-focused cryptocurrencies is the NVT ratio. The NVT utilizes the USD value of the transaction volume and the market capitalization of each cryptocurrency to try to determine when a coin is moving more based on speculation rather than when it is moving because of an increase in value being transacted. The higher the NVT, the more overvalued the coin theoretically is. The day to day variance of this metric can be very volatile so to smooth it out I like looking at the 90 day adjustment. Bitcoin's 90 day NVT ratio is still above 150. It's gone from the cheapest PoW coin by NVT last summer to the most expensive one now. There is no standard rule for what a low NVT is or what a high NVT is. Personally, I think 150 is high. I take that view because before February of this year, the last time BTC was above 150 on a 90 day adjusted NVT was in November 2013. Summary There are many lessons that crypto participants can take from the Jump/Arkham confusion. From where I sit, the most important one is to watch the chains, not the Twitter feed. I would also be very cautious when using leverage in these assets. Market participants who buy and hold with confidence didn't get wiped out on Wednesday. It was the day traders and margin bettors who did. Block Reward vs Price (LookIntoBitcoin) There is a Bitcoin halving a year away. If history rhymes, BTC's dollar denominated price will be much higher in 18 to 24 months than it is now. Dollar cost average holders who don't play the margin game will likely do very well post-halving. At this point, the last thing a Bitcoin bull should want is to get wiped out through leverage before the next cycle starts. Risks certainly remain and there is no guarantee that BTC will continue to behave the same way it has behaved following previous halving events. When assessing everything that I'm seeing on chain, I would probably be cautious rather than aggressive at this point. It is very possible we see a higher BTC price in the weeks and months ahead. There are positive signs from a usage and a holder growth standpoint. However, I believe in the shorter term, bulls who want to aggressively scale a position rather than dollar cost average over time can probably be patient and wait for a better price.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | ARKM,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4598409-bitcoin-flash-crash-and-look-at-fundamentals?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/12255910.jpeg

The regulator is also processing applications for digital exchanges on a trial basis, intending them to undergo one year of “regulatory incubation” with limited services offered and under SEC monitoring to determine the firms' fitness to provide services.  “By the tenth month, we should be able to make a determination whether to register the firm, extend the incubation period or even ask the firm to stop operation,” Abbas told Bloomberg.  According to the report, the SEC will not start registering digital asset exchanges until it reaches an agreement with the nation's central bank, which has blocked local financial institutions from interacting with crypto services providers.
