42400355,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNdW,1504533662,"Analysis: Bitcoin Price Corrects on China News, But Uptrend Still Intact","The cryptocurrency market is a sea of red today, a development skeptics will no doubt quickly use to make the case against bitcoin as a 21st century gold.  In times of economic or political stress, investors prefer to hold safe haven assets, and while many experts believe bitcoin is the new safe haven, today's dismal performance contradicts such claims. The cryptocurrency dropped 5 percent over the last 24 hours, even while North Korea's nuclear test and heightened geopolitical tensions pushed up traditional safe haven assets like gold, Japanese Yen.  Overall, bitcoin (BTC) clocked an intraday low of $4,253 earlier today, and was trading around $4,335 levels on news China has banned initial coin offerings, one of the main trends powering this year's boom.  Still, the price decline comes amid an uptick in trading. CoinMarketCap data shows volumes on Bitfinex, which offers trading in the BTC/USD pair, are up 7.11 percent.  Ethereum (ETH) was the biggest loser among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, down 12.14 percent in the last 24 hours, as it remains the platform of choice for most ICOs. Bitcoin Cash (BCC) had also shed around 3.7 percent and was last seen trading around $554.  Limited impact  So, what should we make of the day's developments?  As the December 2016 close on the CoinDesk BPI was just under $1,000, the cryptocurrency has still rallied more than 400% this year.  Following a rally of such humongous proportion, a healthy correction is much needed as it serves two purposes:  It will calm market nerves – Pundits have started comparing bitcoin mania to the 16th century Tulip bubble. A correction here would calm market nerves and help restore confidence in the bitcoin rally.  Is heightened curiosity for real? The stellar rally in bitcoin led to increased curiosity about bitcoin and crypto space in general. Investors who missed out on the rally would want to board the bitcoin freight train during a technical pullback. Strong dip demand would indicate the heightened curiosity is for real… investors are not just curious but are willing to allocate a part of their portfolio to virtual currencies. Weak dip demand or absence of dip demand would be bad news.  Bigger uptrend is still intact  Daily chart  Disclaimer: This article should not be taken as, and is not intended to provide, investment advice.

One of the world's largest bitcoin miners and producers of mining hardware, Bitmain is reported to be raising the funding from participants including Sequoia Capital, ING Capital and several other undisclosed investors as part of a plan to raise its profile among investors.  Bloomberg also said the firm intends to expand into production of chips for artificial intelligence and set up mining farms in the U.S.  The unnamed source, according to the report, claimed the investing companies also intend to offer Bitmain management advice as part of the deal.  Bitmain's mining pool – by which miners combine their efforts to have a better chance of solving blocks and receiving bitcoin rewards – is currently the second most powerful globally.

42400342,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNQj,1504528806,China Outlaws ICOs: Financial Regulators Order Halt on Token Trading,"China has officially outlawed ICOs.  In a joint statement issued by seven financial regulators today, the world's most populous nation outlined why it believes that nascent fundraising mechanism is illegal under domestic law. Authorities backing the statement include the People's Bank of China, the Central Network Office, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Banking Regulatory Commission.  A translation of the statement reads:  ""ICO financing refers to the activity of an entity raising virtual currencies, such as bitcoin or ethereum, through illegally selling and distributing tokens. In essence, it is a kind of non-approved illegal open fund raising behavior, suspected of illegal sale tokens, illegal securities issuance and illegal fund-raising, financial fraud, pyramid schemes and other criminal activities.""  The second article further clarifies what this determination means, stating that ""as of the date of this announcement, all types of currency issuance financing activities shall cease immediately.""  Adding to that, it also demanded that ""persons or organizations who have completed ICOs shall refund the investors, protect the investors' rights, and deal with the risks properly. It concluded with a warning that ""people who refuse to cease ICO activities or refuse to refund investors will be investigated and severely punished according to the law.""  The third article states that the regulation on trading platforms shall be tightened, ""as of the date of this announcement, trading platforms shall not conduct any exchange business between fiat money and tokens, shall not provide information and price for token trading.""  At this time, it is not clear how ethereum, the largest platform that has leveraged such a token sale, and the platform on which many are being launched, will be affected.  Other articles prohibit financial institutions such as banks from doing business with ICO funding, and warn about the public risks of trading ICO tokens.  Market reaction  At press time, the value of cryptocurrency assets issued by way of ICOs has seen a substantial impact on the news. Valued at a combined $10 billion earlier this week, according to CoinMarketCap, the market declined to below $7.5 billion today, a 25% decline.  Most impacted were the largest ICO tokens, with OmiseGo and Qtum declining from total market values of above $1 billion earlier this week to $781 million and $638 million today.

42400358,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNgT,1504527356,Hotel Heiress Paris Hilton Is the Latest Celebrity to Promote an ICO,"Celebrity heiress and reality TV star Paris Hilton has taken to Twitter to announce her participation in a token sale, or ICO.  Called Lydian, the venture claims the project is developing ""blockchain driven technologies to reduce ad fraud and to maximize the effectiveness of ad marketing expenditures."" The idea has been floated by a number of projects of late, including efforts backed by advertising industry participants.  In the tweet, Hilton wrote:    Looking forward to participating in the new @LydianCoinLtd Token! #ThisIsNotAnAd #CryptoCurrency #BitCoin #ETH #BlockChain pic.twitter.com/a8kT9eHEko      — Paris Hilton (@ParisHilton) September 3, 2017    It appears the ICO is not the only case of the media personality's engagement with the tech, either.  An Instagram post that has surfaced from a year ago features Hilton sitting next to former ethereum CCO Stephan Tual. In a caption, it states that Hilton is ""about to venture into the new millennium of technology, community and social services in the most mind blowing way.""  So far, the celebrity endorsement seems to have won the project additional scrutiny.  The team behind Lydian has yet to be announced, but a promo YouTube video uploaded by Gurbaksh Chabal seems to feature clips of the internet entrepreneur and convicted felon speaking on the talk show ""Oprah.""  Hilton is not the first celebrity to promote blockchain recently, with boxing champion Floyd Mayweather making similar posts recently. However, while Hilton claims the post is ""#NotAnAd,"" Mayweather was employed by a company called the Crypto Media Group, which has said it is targeting celebrities for promotional purposes.  Overall, the development is the latest that suggests the cryptocurrency markets may be coming closer to the mainstream. According to CoinDesk data, ICO projects have raised more than $1.8 billion since 2013 by using the funding mechanism.

42400357,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNeV,1504522817,Cryptocurrency and Central Banks: The Quest to Dematerialize Money,"Eugene Etsebeth is a former central bank technologist with the South African Reserve Bank. There, he notably chaired the virtual currency and distributed ledger working group.  In this opinion piece, Etsebeth outlines why he believes all central banks will attempt to dematerialise notes and coins eventually, and what that means for central banks.      Today, nation states have a monopoly on the issuance of notes and coins, one enforced with acts and regulations.  One just needs to revisit history to see how Liberty Dollar creator Bernard von NotHaus was charged with federal crimes for trying to mint his own private currency. Agents of the U.S. Secret Service and FBI raided the Liberty Dollar offices in 2007 and confiscated all its gold, silver and platinum. Bank accounts were frozen and computers seized.  Fast forward to 2017 and central bank-issued currencies and privately issued cryptocurrencies have been co-existing for almost a decade. Libertarians are acutely aware that it is only the decentralized and cryptographic nature of cryptocurrencies that keep the government agents from the door.  And there is reason for suspicions. A larger drive by central banks to dematerialize money has been ongoing since long before the advent of cryptocurrencies, and it can be said that the technology is emboldening central bank attempts to issue digital money.  New motivation  Key to this trend is that bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies have shown a potential answer to how the dematerialization of money may be rolled out by central banks.  Recently, Kaspar Korjus, managing director of Estonia's e-Residency scheme, posed the forward-thinking question: ""Should Estonia begin issuing its own crypto tokens to e-residents (as well as citizens and residents)?"" On the flip side, a South African Reserve Bank official made a statement that cryptocurrencies are ""too risky.""  Central bankers are interested in the choices and advantages of the dematerialisation of currency.  Here are some of the attributes being considered:  And there is upside here.  Currently, chief cashiers and currency mangers at central banks around the globe are faced with enormous challenges when it comes to issuing physical notes and coins.  These include:  Cost: printing polymer- or cotton paper-based notes is expensive. The minting of coin costs money. This cost affects the seigniorage income of central banks (profit made by a central bank by issuing currency, especially the difference between the face value of note and coins and their production costs).  Counterfeiting: there has been an increase in technologies to assist criminals in forging notes and coin.  Market readiness: vending and ticketing machines need template changes when new notes and coins come to market. Citizens must also be educated on the new features.  Distribution: distributing notes and coins to banks, branches and ATMs is expensive and time consuming.  Theft: often violent robberies are attempted on cash-in-transit vans. ATMs are blown up and banks robbed.  Destruction: the lifecycle of notes and coin require the mutilated and marred notes and coin be returned to the central bank depots to be destroyed.  Added costs  Still, one must remember the removal of costs doesn't always lead to savings.  When planning for a central bank-issued digital currency (using a centralized model analogous to cash) most of these challenges will be removed or replaced with new challenges.  Specifically, these include:  Cost: the marginal cost of making digital money will be close to zero. Costs will include purchasing new technology and skilled resources.  Counterfeiting: The double-spend problem will likely be checked with a notary or other centralized model. Cyber security teams will monitor the system.  Market readiness: preparing citizens and institutions for a form of electronic legal tender provided over a mobile device is a multi-year initiative. The financial services that become available once citizens can hold digital currency on their wallets will change how financial services are delivered.  Distribution: distribution will be analogous to physical cash. Central banks will likely issue digital currency to banks cryptographically. Customers will store, send and spend with bank-managed wallets.  Theft: protecting against theft will require private key infrastructure (PKI), hardware security modules and other layers of cyber-security.  Destruction: how a central bank will approach destroying money in circulation will need to be defined per central bank, and opens up a few questions of when and why this may be done.  Shining a light  That's not to say there aren't other factors that should be considered.  By issuing digital currency, central banks could fulfill their mandate by potentially identifying all transactions. Remember, anonymous transactions are the bugbear of international organizations like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  Further, the loss of anonymity and the advent of instant taxation could be significant – and troubling – outcomes of the dematerialization of money.  Still, by releasing a digital currency, central banks would also invite comparison.  Commonly, most private currencies also have baked-in scarcity of money supply. By contrast, central banks have an open cheque book and money supply by committee.  Private currencies are produced, protected and upgraded by the best minds in cryptography. Central banks rely on partnering with large consulting and technology providers.  Private currencies are oblivious to borders – they are global. Central banks ring fence the national currency.  Private currencies morph freely and move into networks to produce tokenized market places. Central bank digital currencies consider allowing licensed participants to build on closed loop (national) financial services.  The differences are overwhelming. The destiny of many nation states will rest on how central banks decide to act. A likely problem for central banks is that once central banks issue their own digital currency, then they will more prominently announce the competition with existing cryptocurrencies.  The light will shine brightly on areas of difference.

42400354,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNbY,1504517464,"Bitcoin Price Falls Below $4,500 as Crypto Markets Lose Billions","Just two days after achieving a historic high of over $5,000 on September 2, bitcoin's price has plummeted to below $4,400.  The notable sell-off – the biggest in the crypto markets since July 15 – began immediately after the record high of $5,013.91 had been reached Saturday, and has continued today, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Starting the session at $4,631, the digital asset traded sideways for a time (with a high of $4,636), until around 07:00 UTC, when a sharp drop was observed taking bitcoin to a low of $4,345 for the session.  At press time, the price had recovered a tad to $4,367 – a drop of 5.7 percent ($263) for the day so far.  The downwards movement reflects a general drop in the cryptocurrency markets.  A glance at CoinMarketCap data reveals that most digital assets are down today, with only a couple of cryptocurrencies showing in the green.  Amid losses across all the top 10 cryptocurrencies, notably, ethereum is down 14.53 percent, litecoin is down 15.37 percent, and monero has dropped 12 percent.  Looking at the markets as a whole, since reaching a record high of around $180 billion, the combined market cap for all cryptocurrencies is now $152 billion – a drop of $28 billion.

42400348,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJNUf,1504512054,Ideation to Realization: How Dutch Banks Are Harnessing Blockchain,"Sanja Petkovic and Arnab Sinha are management consultants at Accenture, the Netherlands, where they specialize in blockchain within banking and digital payments, respectively.  In this opinion piece, Petkovic and Sinha discuss how financial firms in the European country are approaching blockchain, and how trends in the technology are shaping their work and progress.      Dutch organizations and banks have been at the forefront of European blockchain initiatives since 2013–14.  Driven by the dire need to improve return on equity (RoE), these initiatives experimented on the technology's potential to enhance efficiency, trust, transparency, reach and innovation in the banking model.  It is therefore quite telling that, bolstered by the learning from the past three years, the summer of 2017 is seeing all the leading Dutch banks making significant headways in realizing their blockchain agendas.  Early in July, 2017 two leading Dutch banks – ABN AMRO and Rabobank joined SWIFT's blockchain proof-of-concept (PoC) initiative for the Global Payments Innovation (GPI) service. At the same time, ING successfully completed the testing of blockchain-powered trade confirmation platform in partnership with Calypso and the R3 consortium.  While the Dutch have traditionally been known for their innovation (Netherlands ranks third in Global Innovation Index), this success story in blockchain is often attribute to a focused coherence between policy, collaboration and supervision, propelling the Dutch banks to the forefront of multiple global initiatives. This article aims to highlight some of the key blockchain-related themes observed in the Dutch banking landscape over the recent years, the outlook for 2017–18 and reflects on few key learnings from their success.  Dutch banks have made significant strides in blockchain adoption and are exploring opportunities across business lines  Research suggests that most large Dutch banks have intensified their blockchain initiatives in 2016–17 and are evolving from the paper-based exploratory phase by mobilizing proofs-of-concept across different business lines.  ING worked on 27 proofs-of-concept in six business areas: payments, trade finance and working capital solutions, financial markets, bank treasury, lending and compliance and identity. Tangible key performance indicators (KPIs) were used to validate the results and suitability of these proofs-of-concept. For instance, the PoC on trade finance showed considerable gains in an otherwise paper-based process, resulting into potential cost savings of 10–15% and revenue uptake of 15%.  On a similar vein, ABN AMRO has launched a pilot to explore how the blockchain application ""Torch"" can allow parties involved in a real-estate transaction to seamlessly record and exchange information. The bank also explored how blockchain might solve issues in financial auditing and compliance, in Financial Recovery and Restructuring (FR&R).  Rabobank focused its initiatives on cross-border payments and micropayments, while SNS Bank moved out of traditional banking areas to test out the use of blockchain in addressing inefficiencies in healthcare system.  Collaboration is driving momentum  Close collaboration continues to be an absolute necessity for exploring the opportunities using blockchain. The search for the right blockchain technology and appropriate use cases led the Dutch banks to partner with other banks and fintechs, or in joining regional and global consortiums.  In 2016, ING worked with partners inside and outside the bank, including consortiums such as R3, the Dutch central bank, the Dutch Payments Association and the European Banking Forum. The bank also partnered with Société Générale and trading house Mercuria to test a live oil trade using blockchain.  ABN AMRO collaborated with Dutch university (TU Delft) and Port of Rotterdam and 14 other parties to explore blockchain opportunities in logistics. This $2.2 million project focuses on the delivery of three concrete use cases: supply chain financing, inventory financing and circular economy. Meanwhile Rabobank worked with accelerator programs like Startupbootcamp, Footbytes, Rockstart and Nexus labs, and with technology providers like D+H.  These developments were followed by the coordinated and open network approach envisioned in the Dutch market through the formation of the National Blockchain Coalition (in March, 2017), representing possibly one of the leading government-driven efforts to develop and create the ""conditions for reliable and socially acceptable blockchain applications.""  Preferred platforms emerge  Also emerging have been specific platforms that are now favored by these institutions.  Over the last 18 months, many proofs-of-concept were built leveraging the ethereum or Hyperledger technologies. These are among the most mature technologies for the permissioned blockchain where external actors are allowed, and as such have been widely accepted by the Dutch banks.  Also, smart contracts, programmable contracts defined with computer code which can facilitate, verify, execute and enforce the negotiation or performance of contract terms automatically, are making an impact as leading blockchain use cases. They are built on top of the blockchain solution itself.  ING, ABN AMRO and Rabobank are using smart contract solutions to reap the benefits of ""less paperwork"" and thereby reducing transaction processing costs.  Outlook for 2017-2018  While 2016-17 focused on exploration and proofs-of-concept across a wide range of business lines, it is likely that in 2017–18, the Dutch banks will concentrate their efforts on selected operating areas and use cases and narrow down on solutions ripe for commercialization.  The coming year will see notable advances in blockchain use by the Dutch banks – evolving from the concept phase to full blow solutions. All leading Dutch banks will have blockchain prototypes ready and will also have these solutions tested for performance and scalability. It is likely that some of these solutions will be launched as pilots (typically for payments, supply chain and trade finance offerings) and the initial concrete steps for commercialization will be taken.  This evolution is in line with Accenture predicted maturity journey for blockchain, which foresees regulatory certainty steering early adoption in 2017, followed by a growth phase between 2018–24 and the technology becoming mainstream in 2025.  In essence, while we are still few years away from broad market adoption, 2017–18 is likely to be the year when blockchain in banking can move from promise to real solutions.  Takeaways for blockchain initiatives  An assessment of the ongoing initiatives, proof-of-concepts and the resulting success stories provide a clear indication that blockchain readiness among the Dutch banks is considerably higher compared to many European and global markets.  This is often attributed to the vibrant startup scene in the Netherlands, where technology output is driving the economy.  At the same time, there are larger trends at play among technologists, and these could provide headwinds. These include:  Importance of clearly defined governance: Arranging a governance structure while keeping in mind the cooperation on different standards from different stakeholders is key to mobilize a blockchain program.  Understanding the ""known-unknowns"" on the legal aspects of blockchain – especially when we look at the area of data privacy some challenges are expected if traditional databases are to become obsolete in an otherwise blockchain powered solution.  The immutability and distribution of data: This does not typically go hand-in hand with data retention laws like the ""right to be forgotten"". Human errors or mischiefs very much restrict use cases currently.  Performance, data privacy, scalability and maintainability: Data privacy is still an area that Dutch banks are struggling with as trust is seen as highly important. Before rolling out into real solutions, banks must ensure that technology will not compromise client data.  Early alignment with risk and compliance partners in a changing risk environment: Risk management functions within banks are traditionally not well equipped to work with multiple stakeholders. Success of blockchain initiatives are often dependent on how evolving risk parameters are addressed.  There are too many different blockchain technologies currently available. To stimulate collaboration, stakeholders should have a clear vision on a single technology that will drive the implementation.  Parting thoughts  While the idea of blockchain and its challenges are still being explored, the potential impact of the technology on bank bottom lines are increasingly becoming evident.  An Accenture-McLagan research estimates that blockchain based database systems can reduce 70 percent of central finance reporting cost, lower 30–50 percent of compliance cost and can further provide 50 percent potential cost savings on business operations.  Such compelling numbers will provide sufficient justifications as global banks prioritize their blockchain agenda for 2017–18.  Blockchain has often been termed as the ""biggest thing since the internet"" and while its adoption in traditional environments (after the bitcoin initiative) has been gradual and incremental, there is still every possible sign that the technology can be truly transformational and banks can harness its potential to disrupt the ""status-quo.""
