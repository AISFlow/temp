42428769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdwBh,1522497915,IBM Is Finally Getting Serious About Cryptocurrency,"It wasn't long ago that your average enterprise wouldn't even mention bitcoin, ethereum, or any number of cryptocurrencies in public.  Instead of using the cryptographically secure tokens to streamline workflows – or even talking about doing so – some of the most recognizable enterprises in blockchain have largely confined themselves to uses of blockchain as a new decentralized database, absent any digital assets.  Slowly however, over the past several years that has started to change. Executives at large corporations have shown themselves to be increasingly willing to take public stances both for (and against) what is now a $300 billion token market.  But if 2017 was the year that companies began talking about crypto, it wasn't until recently that enterprises have been willing to publicly use cryptocurrencies in both early-stage prototypes and live applications.  Now, it would seem the floodgates are prepared to open, with the $140 billion IBM revealing to CoinDesk that it has been meeting with executives from commodities trading platforms, large corporations, and perhaps most importantly, central banks, to explore how cryptocurrencies can help save them money and generate revenue.  ""We're seeing tons of demand for digital asset issuance across the board,"" said IBM's new head of blockchain development Jesse Lund, who was hired from Wells Fargo earlier this year to help develop the computer giant's cryptocurrency strategy.  At the moment, that work is largely being pursued using the public Stellar platform, and its native cryptocurrency, the lumen (XLM), a partnership made public last October.  But in interview, Lund said IBM is interested in expanding the business applications of cryptocurrencies in a number of ways.  Lund told CoinDesk:  ""What's happening is there's this emergence of a new segment that could actually be one of the biggest segments, that is a permissioned but public blockchain network typology.""  The central bank 'big toe'  There's perhaps no better symbol of this convergence than IBM's early work with central banks.  Over the past year, Lund says he's met with 20 central banks exploring the potential benefits of issuing their own fiat cryptocurrency on a blockchain.  Specifically, he described the ""most durable digital asset"" as one that is ""issued by a central bank that represents a claim on fiat deposits in the real world,"" but still maintains ""some semblance of monetary policy.""  Though he wouldn't reveal the names of most of the central banks with which he's meeting, he described them as largely comprised of banks from the G20, an international forum with members including China, Russia, the U.S. and the EU.  Lund further described the central banks as ""clients in some capacity."" Based on these conversations, he said he expects the first central banks to issue a fiat currency on a blockchain will be ""the smaller ones"" with a high concentration of interest in Asia and North America.  However, ""the most inspiring of the visions of the central banks I've talked to has been Sweden's Riksbank,"" said Lund.  In December 2017, the Riksbank published a white paper detailing its interest in moving Sweden's cash supply to a digital platform, though it didn't mention blockchain specifically.  Still, Lund expects to see decentralized cryptocurrency converge with central banks some time soon.  ""I expect that we'll see — sometime this year — a central bank at least putting its big toe in the water to issue a digital denomination of their fiat currency into the wild,"" said Lund. ""Probably in a controlled format.""  Beyond currency  But IBM's work with assets issued on a blockchain goes beyond central bank-sanctioned cryptocurrency.  By using the same technology that is allowing an increasing number of startups to raise capital on the Stellar platform, IBM is exploring a wide range of other tokens.  Lund breaks down the demand IBM is seeing into three main kinds of tokens: securities tokens that give owners a stake in the issuing company, utility tokens that give users access to a service such as phone minutes and commodities tokens that represent precious metals and other physical assets.  ""We're actually seeing a move toward the issuance of tokens that have a higher velocity that represent, for example, a claim on a portion of gold bullion sitting in a vault somewhere,"" he said.  Beyond the obvious potential interest in this work from commodities exchanges, Lund said IBM is being approached by retail companies, beverage providers and energy companies looking to tokenize various aspects of their business offerings.  A fourth category of companies Lund said is approaching IBM are startups looking to raise capital, though he admits these opportunities have proved less enticing.  ""We're less inclined to do those, we like to see more maturity in the clients that we work with,"" Lund added.  Beyond Stellar  So far, IBM's work with cryptocurrencies has been largely confined to the Stellar network and its native lumen cryptocurrency, which it has used largely in cross-border payments trials.  The company itself is running nine Stellar nodes that help confirm those transactions based in locations around the world, such as Australia, Brazil, Hong Kong and the U.S. However, going forward, IBM is open to working with any number of blockchains.  The most serious of that work appears to be with the Sovrin Foundation that contributed the original codebase of Hyperledger Indy, and is now preparing to issue a crypto asset in an ICO.  While Lund didn't reveal details about that work, he indicated there is an early-stage partnership forming with the non-profit organization. More news, he said, is expected shortly.  From there, IBM's work with cryptocurrencies even further converges on its work with permissioned blockchains.  In January, IBM Research published a detailed white paper that described their work to apply a transaction model used by bitcoin into Hyperledger Fabric's underlying chaincode.  Designed for purely experimental purposes to help compare transaction through-puts in the permissioned blockchain to those on public ledgers, the ""Fabric Coin"" effort resulted in improvements that were included in the Hyperledger Fabric 1.1 released earlier this month.  In this way, Lund expects to see further business opportunties between public and private blockchains continue to develop.  He concluded:  ""We're going to see a lot more convergence between those two ends of the spectrum. The bitcoin and cryptocurrency space that has been hands-off for enterprises and the private, country club blockchain space that is on the other side.""

42428777,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLdwLh,1522494023,Everything You Were Afraid to Ask About Crypto Taxes,"Busayo Ogunsanya is the CEO of AMUS Inc., an artificial intelligence tax platform, and the managing partner of BigAppleTaxReturn, a CPA firm in New York.  The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's Crypto and Taxes 2018 series.      Many cryptocurrency investors have made a fortune the past several years selling high-flying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for cash. Unfortunately, far too many of them in the U.S. did not report this taxable income to the IRS.  The agency figures hundreds of thousands of U.S. residents did not report income from sales or exchanges of cryptocurrency and it might be able to collect several billion dollars in back taxes, penalties, and interest.  In just a taste of what’s to come: After a two-year battle with the IRS, Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, recently turned over information about 13,000 customers who had traded more than $20,000 worth over a two-year period.  Fortunately, the IRS has issued guidance – labeling cryptocurrency an “intangible asset” for investors subject to capital gains and loss treatment using the realization method.  Nevertheless, when it comes to cryptocurrency, most investors are uncertain about the tax consequences.  FAQ  To help navigate this minefield, here are answers to some frequently asked questions from investors on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies:  How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?  As property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss.  Must a taxpayer who receives virtual currency as payment for goods or services include in computing gross income the fair market value of the virtual currency?  Yes. The value must be measured in U.S. dollars, as of the date that the virtual currency was received.  How is the fair market value of virtual currency determined?  If a virtual currency is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.  Does a taxpayer have a gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?  Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has a taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency.  What type of gain or loss does a taxpayer realize on the sale or exchange of virtual currency?  The character of the gain or loss generally depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.  If it is, a taxpayer generally realizes a capital gain or loss on the sale. If not, the taxpayer realizes an ordinary gain or loss. The distinction is more than academic. Ordinary gains are taxed at the top marginal income tax rate of 37 percent, while capital gains tax rates run as high as 15 percent depending on the tax bracket.  For example, stocks, bonds, and other investment property are generally capital assets, which produce capital gains or losses. Inventory and other property held mainly for sale to customers in a trade or for businesses are examples of property that is not a capital asset and therefore would produce ordinary gains or losses.  What are tax consequences of mining bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?  When a taxpayer successfully mines virtual currency, the fair market value of the virtual currency generated as of the date of receipt is includable in gross income.  Further, if a taxpayer’s mining of virtual currency constitutes a trade or business, and the mining activity is not undertaken by the taxpayer as an employee, the net earnings from self-employment (generally, gross income derived from carrying on a trade or business, less allowable deductions) resulting from those activities constitute self-employment income and are subject to the self-employment tax.  What about an independent contractor who gets paid in cryptocurrency for performing services?  Generally, self-employment income includes all gross income derived by an individual from any trade or business carried on by the individual as other than an employee.  Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency received for services performed as an independent contractor, measured in U.S. dollars as of the date of receipt, constitutes self-employment income and is subject to the self-employment tax.  If an employer pays workers for their services in virtual currency, is that considered taxable wages?  Yes. Generally, the medium in which remuneration for services is paid is immaterial to the determination of whether the remuneration constitutes wages for employment tax purposes.  Consequently, the fair market value of virtual currency paid as wages is subject to federal income tax withholding and federal insurance contributions.  Is a payment made using virtual currency subject to information reporting?  Yes, to the same extent as any other payment made in property.  For example, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of “fixed and determinable income” using virtual currency with a value of $600 or more to a U.S. non-exempt recipient in a taxable year is required to report the payment to the IRS and to the payee.  Examples of payments of fixed and determinable income include rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, and compensation.  What about paying an independent contractor with cryptocurrency?  Generally, a person who in the course of a trade or business makes a payment of $600 or more in a taxable year to an independent contractor for the performance of services is required to report that payment to the IRS and to the payee on Form 1099-MISC.  Are payments made using virtual currency subject to backup withholding?  Yes – again, to the same extent as other payments made in property.  Therefore, payors making reportable payments using virtual currency must solicit a taxpayer identification number (TIN) from the payee. The payor must backup-withhold from the payment if a TIN is not obtained prior to payment or if the payor receives notification from the IRS that backup withholding is required.  Are there IRS information reporting requirements for a person who settles payments made in virtual currency on behalf of merchants that accept such currency from their customers?  Yes, if certain requirements are met.  In general, a third party that contracts with a substantial number of unrelated merchants to settle payments between the merchants and their customers is a third party settlement organization (TPSO). A TPSO is required to report payments made to a merchant on a Form 1099-K, Payment Card and Third Party Network Transactions, if, for the calendar year, both (1) the number of transactions settled for the merchant exceeds 200, and (2) the gross amount of payments made to the merchant exceeds $20,000.  When completing Boxes 1, 3, and 5a-1 on the Form 1099-K, transactions where the TPSO settles payments made with virtual currency are aggregated with transactions where the TPSO settles payments made with real currency to determine the total amounts to be reported.  When determining whether the transactions are reportable, once again the value of the virtual currency is the fair market value of the virtual currency in U.S. dollars on the date of payment.  Word to the wise  Yes, that’s a lot of information to process, but ignoring these questions can be hazardous. The IRS is going to come after investors who are not reporting their realized gains.  Complicating matters, most cryptocurrency platforms do not issue a Form 1099 (Form 1099 is one of several IRS tax forms used in the United States to prepare and file an information return to report various types of income other than wages, salaries, and tips).  I recommend investors use software that keeps track of their cost basis, unrealized gains and losses to accurate report their investment gains.  If you stay ready, you don’t have to get ready when the IRS issues an audit on your tax return for unreported income.
