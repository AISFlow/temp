42399205,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibcu,1470083124,Children's Aid Organization UNICEF Seeks Blockchain Lead,"The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) is seeking a software developer and consultant who can help it lead its blockchain efforts.  A terms of reference sheet published last week outlines in detail how the international aid organization is seeking to leverage the technology in accordance with its goals to improve child welfare around the world.  Specifically, the prospective developer and consultant would aid in ""research, consulting and prototyping applications for humanitarian purposes"".  UNICEF goes on to highlight existing projects focused on identity and remittances – two areas the organization has said in the past represent key use cases.  UNICEF representative Dana Zucker told CoinDesk:  ""We want to grow our knowledge and thinking, so we want to bring someone on who can help lead the charge on thinking, researching and creating use cases for how blockchain will play a role in UNICEF's work.""  The role will likely form one aspect of the agency’s overall strategy toward blockchain applications, which includes a commitment to funding startups through its innovation arm.

42399198,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibXz,1470080869,Brazilian Bitcoin Market Consolidates With Exchange Acquisition,"Brazilian bitcoin exchange Foxbit has acquired payment processor BitInvest in an acquisition worth less than $1m.  With the sale, the exchange said it is seeking to acquire new users and reinforce its position in Brazil’s nascent bitcoin market.  Foxbit said BitInvest founder Flavio Pripas, the former founder of the social network Fashion.me, will serve on its board. All BitInvest accounts will be converted to Foxbit accounts as part of the deal.  The acquisition is notable given the early traction seen by BitInvest, which inked a deal in 2014 with Tecnisa, a domestic real estate firm that was Latin America's largest merchant to accept bitcoin at the time.  Still, Foxbit chief blockchain officer João Paulo Oliveira said he expects additional acquisitions as the Brazilian market matures.  Oliveira said:  ""We are in an interesting position, as the bitcoin ecosystem grows, exchanges that are not growing will be less competitive. It is a matter of process.""  According to data from Bitvalor, Foxbit sees about 310 BTC (or $189,000) in bitcoins trade daily on its exchange, a figure that accounts for roughly 55% of the market.  Oliveira said Foxbit aims to continue its momentum from the acquisition by launching a debit card for users and a consumer wallet later this year.  Foxbit said no additional employees will join the startup as part of the deal.

42399208,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibdt,1470076356,Alibaba Affiliate Taps Blockchain for Charity Payments,"Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial has created a private, proof-of-stake blockchain that seeks to help make charities more transparent and accountable.  The news comes just months after Ant Financial closed a $4.5bn private fundraising round at a $60bn valuation. Ant Financial was spun out of China-based e-commerce giant Alibaba prior to its 2014 IPO, though both are overseen by executive chairman Jack Ma.  The trial is envisioned as one that could come to record donations made by Alipay users to charities through its “Ant Love” platform, Bloomberg reports, a move that may ultimately allow users to gain greater insight into how funds are handled by charities.  Ant Financial CTO Cheng Li told Bloomberg:  “We hope to bring more transparency to charity and blockchain technology’s decentralized nature fits that purpose well. It means that all the information and transaction history of funds will be more reliable and can’t be easily tampered with.”  According to the report, Ant Financial is currently the only firm with access to the blockchain, though it could open up access to third-party charities as the project matures.

42399199,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibZx,1470070083,Anonymous Blockchain Micropayments Advance With 'Bolt',"Can blockchain micropayments be fast, decentralized and private?  That question arguably forms the core of a new white paper penned by researchers at Johns Hopkins University that explores methods for bringing greater anonymity to off-blockchain micropayment networks.  In the paper, researchers Matthew Green and Ian Miers explore privacy in the context of micropayment channels and outline a new scheme for blind off-chain lightweight transactions, or Bolt, which they believe will provide ""private, instantaneous [and] anonymous payments"".  The proposal  comes at a time when privacy efforts are mainly being directed toward on-blockchain payments, as opposed to those that would be carried out on top-level architecture. This, the paper argues, means privacy concerns related to proposed projects (such as bitcoin's Lightning Network) have received less attention, despite the belief these networks will prove key to extending cryptocurrencies to more users.  Miers, who also worked on the anonymous cryptocurrency Zcash and Zerocoin (the protocol on which its based), told CoinDesk:  ""The question is: Can you build something like Lightning that actually does provide privacy? That was the motivation.""  Three limitations  In Miers' eyes, cryptocurrencies face three main issues: scalability (or the ability to support more users), the slow speed at which transactions are confirmed (around 10 minutes for bitcoin and two-and-a-half minutes for Zcash) and transaction privacy.  Micropayment channel networks, such as the in-progress Lightning Network or Thunder Network, solve the first two problems by moving transactions to a new layer. Instead of recording every transaction on the blockchain, users open up channels, perhaps someday by clicking in an app, settling transactions on the blockchain only when necessary.  Proponents argue this solves the scalability issue and allows for many more transactions while still not requiring trust in any third party.  Finally, there’s the issue of privacy, which has been partially addressed by Zerocoin and the much-anticipated Zcash, the release of which was delayed last week.  This anonymous cryptocurrency, the researchers say, could guard channel openings and closures from revealing information about the customer and merchant. However, the paper suggests that it would do little to hide information on micropayment channels.  A new Bolt blog post explains why this might be a problem:  ""These IOUs form a unique identifier which can be used to track Alice much like a cookie. Anyone who observes these (eg the Tor exit node) will not a priori know who the identifier belongs to – her actual identity is still protected by the anonymity service – but they can still observe page views and patterns because multiple payments on a payment channel are inherently linkable.""  This is enough information to potentially reveal the person’s identity or other information about his or her online activity, the researchers argue.  Anonymizing Lightning  Bolt chips away at the remaining problem privacy problem by making payments within the channel unlinkable.  ""You accomplish paying them, but you haven’t revealed who you are,"" Miers explained.  It anonymizes the ""IOUs"" in the micropayment channel by using two long-established cryptography techniques called commitments (which hide the value of a payment) and blind signatures (which allow someone to sign a transaction without revealing what’s being signed).  Bolt works with bi-directional micropayment channels where parties connect directly to each other and update payments each way, but for now, there’s one key limitation. Bolt can only support one intermediary hop, meaning it is perhaps not as decentralized as desired by developers.  Miers argues there's still a risk payment channels could become centralized, and that multi-hop micropayments, such as those offered by Lightning's proposals, could fail to materialize.  In the case of this future, he argues Bolt will protect user information.  ""If Lightning takes off it might be concentrated in the hands of a few players – you'll end up with an analog of Visa or Mastercard where you don't have to trust them with your money, but they're going to be able to see all of these transactions,"" he said, adding:  ""Bolt is a nice way of making sure they don't see anything at all.""  Bolt's future  According to the researchers, Bolt can work with any cryptocurrency as long as it supports the necessary cryptography primitives.  Bitcoin can support it right now, but ""at the cost of using hash-­based commitments and generic circuit­-based multi­party computation (MPC) for blind signing with ECDSA,"" as the blog post explains.  However, Miers said that it works much better when paired with an anonymous currency like Zcash. Payments on the same micropayment channel will be unlinkable when using Bolt, but the part where you establish the channel on the blockchain won’t be.  All in all, Miers sees Bolt and micropayment channels solving key problems that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have faced so far.  Further, the researchers plan to release a prototype in the near future. Incorporating it into a cryptocurrency, they said, will take more time.

42399190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibR6,1470066731,IBM Building Blockchain Dispute Resolution System,"IBM could launch a finance-oriented blockchain solution as early as this fall.  According to The Wall Street Journal,IBM's Global Financing unit is looking to kick off a project that would focus on resolving transaction disputes. The system reportedly won’t replace the Global Financing unit’s existing systems, at least not in the near term. Rather, it will operate beside what is currently used.  According to IBM, as many as 25,000 disputes arise in this division of the company each year, holding up as much as $100m in capital. The blockchain-based system is expected to reduce the time in which it takes to clear a dispute and release the contested funds.  Though no release date is known at this time, IBM could launch the blockchain solution as early as September, the report said.

42399202,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibaw,1470059744,Bitcoin Browser Brave Raises $4.5 Million to Fight Online Ads,"The maker of ad-blocking browser Brave has raised $4.5m to expand its effort to let users voluntarily send bitcoin micropayments to their favorite websites in exchange for an ad-free experience.  When Brave Software first unveiled a version of the browser earlier this year, members of the media signed what has been called a cease-and-desist letter addressed to Brave. Signed by some of the biggest publishers in the world, the letter described what they perceived as the browser’s ""blatantly illegal"" blocking of their ad revenue.  Since then, the company’s founder has been engaging with those media outlets one-on-one in an effort to explain that Brave isn’t meant just to prevent Internet users from having their data mined, but to give media organizations a way to recover revenue from those who are already blocking ads.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Brave Software founder and CEO Brendan Eich said he intends to use the money to double the company's employees from 10 to 20 people and continue to help bridge the gap between content creators and users.  Eich said:­­­  ""We want win-win for users and publishers. We put users first, but we want publishers to earn a better share than what they receive with traditional ad blocking.""  Participating in the round are Founders Fund's FF Angel, Propel Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, Foundation Capital, and Digital Currency Group.  With a total of $7m now raised, the San Francisco-based firm plans to invest the money in adding new features to the platform and hiring additional staff with a special focus on quality assurance as part of its growth strategy.  The value proposition  Dan Morehead, CEO of Pantera Capital, which invested $1m in this most recent round, told CoinDesk it is exactly this ability to navigate the space between content creators and consumers that first ""resonated"" with his firm.  Morehead points to a history of seemingly dominant browsers including Netscape and Internet Explorer being disrupted by innovative new services as evidence of the place he sees Brave filling in the market today.  In Brave’s case, that innovation is a business model that empowers users by protecting their identity and gives media companies a way to generate the revenue.  ""Right now you have the two extremes. The annoying ad and subscription models and the annoying ad blocking,"" said Morehead, adding:  ""Brave is this middle ground between the crazy ad system we currently have and where all ads are blocked and no content is produced.""  Bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin  Brave is currently partnering with wallet providers BitGo and Coinbase to provide bitcoin wallets and purchasing tools and Eich says he hopes to partner in the future with wallet provider Blockchain.info.  But he added that while support for diverse wallets is a high priority, Brave has no plans to add support for ethereum or its new cryptocurrency cousin, Ethereum Classic.  ""We’re just sticking with bitcoin because we need something frictionless under the hood,"" he said.  He concluded:  ""We’re still excited about using bitcoin.""  Going forward, Eich says one of the company’s top priorities will be to design identity-protection services that do a better job of preventing identifiable information from ""leaking through"" where marketers can access it.  Brave is currently available for download for iOS and Android mobile devices and several desktop platforms. The version currently available is a developer version, with a 1.0 release scheduled for September 2016.

42399212,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbibhp,1470054978,Public Blockchains: The Community vs The Ecosystem,"William Mougayar is the author of ""The Business Blockchain"", and a board advisor to the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit that oversees the development of one of two blockchains seeking to popularize the ethereum software.  In this opinion piece, Mougayar offers his thoughts on the recent ethereum hard fork, opining on how he believes it showcases issues in current public blockchain governance.  We always hear the word ""community"" as a reference to the body of players who are supposed to be the stakeholders that care the most about such or such blockchain.  This term has been a cornerstone of recent events, like bitcoin's 'block size' debate and the ethereum hard fork, coloring how these events are communicated to the wider public.  But what does ""community"" mean in this context?  Defining community  According to blockchain theory, the community is supposed to determine the future of a given public blockchain via decentralized governance and the magic of consensus.  Consensus decision-making is at the heart of public blockchains, because a plain majority can sway it one way or the other. Just like an election, more or less.  The baseline of a blockchain rests on its economic soundness, and the reality is that some players hold the strings to this economic soundness more than others. (Economic soundness also directly relates to blockchain security, but let’s not digress on that important tangent).  With such deciding power on the future of public blockchains, the community is an important body, because it represents the current governance.  So, I went on a research investigation to figure out the composition of a typical blockchain community. What I found is that this deciding community is a subset of a larger ecosystem.  The community represents the base players that have had an earlier economic role in the ecosystem. They are mostly the insiders, and they have an advantage in being more ""in-the-know"" than others. Their voices are louder, and their collective actions (or inactions) can effectively determine a blockchain's trajectory.  Who's who?  There is something contrarian about cryptocurrency communities.  In the traditional sense, most companies will firstly gain users or customers, either as end-users or developers. Then the body and variety of users becomes the community.  In the cryptocurrency space, that sequence seems to be inverted.  We start with the community of core supporters before we get to a large set of end-users. That’s okay, and perhaps a characteristic of fundamental technologies that need to garner a strong base before they flourish.  Generically, the base players of a cryptocurrency community are largely developers, exchanges and miners..  The larger ecosystem involves several other participants. It can be portrayed to include the base players, in addition to groups like venture capitalists and mainstream users.  Here's a breakdown of each group:  Let us take the cases of the recent ethereum hard fork decision, and the bitcoin block size debate epitomized by the Scaling Bitcoin conference series.  In both instances, the community was mostly formed of the respective base players. But these base players are a relatively small group.  In the bitcoin case, the number of attendees to the widely publicized Scaling Bitcoin process was probably under 100. And in the case of ethereum, when the Carbonvote was tallied, only a total of 1,325 addresses voted, which is a relatively small number compared to the overall number of ETH holders (considering there is an available supply of 82 million ETH).  Ecosystem approach  I hope we eventually use the word ecosystem instead of community, because it is more representative of a marketplace in the making.  And I wish that a part of this larger ecosystem would also have a voice into the future of these public blockchains.  Currently, the larger ecosystem is mostly a powerless silent majority that is watching events unfold, while remaining hopeful that the vocal and more powerful minority is going to lead the market in the right direction.  Eventually, any large scale public blockchain will need to reach a more balanced state where community leadership and ecosystem inclusion work together to strengthen its longevity and sustainability potential.  The base players are the community today, and they are steering the boat right now, but will they in the future?
