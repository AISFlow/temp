42422963,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yvBh,1374501156,Inside Butterfly Labs: The ASIC bitcoin mining arms race,"CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey recently visited and toured the facilities at Butterfly Labs, one of the most prominent and written about producers of bitcoin mining technology. In this second part of this series, he reports on the factors involved in the bitcoin mining arms race.  Now that Butterfly Labs is shipping ASIC bitcoin miners at a steady pace, their production plus that of Avalon and mining pools like ASICMiner are causing the mining difficulty to go up quite quickly. What this means is that it takes more computational power to complete proof of work algorithms. It means that a race is now on to offer the most processing power, but will also mean that other technical elements will come into play very soon.  I asked Butterfly Labs if the rise in mining difficulty is causing an increase in sales which might be leading to the price fluctuations. They didn’t seem overly concerned about any price volatility. It seemed to me that they have simply been too busy to contemplate if mining had anything to do with the price on any given day. “I don’t think that anyone knows. It's so uncharted"", Dave McClain, who works on account management, told me during my recent visit to BFL.  The current generation of bitcoin miners  In the previous FPGA generation, processing was measured in hundreds of megahashes. The current generation of Bitcoin miners perform at a speed of gigahashes. The most powerful unit that Butterfly Labs offers is the 500 gigahash per second Mini Rig SC, currently priced at $22,484. It comes with a Nexus 7 tablet that has a custom built BFL app for mining bitcoins, which is also known as a ""host"" device since the miners need a software application to tell them what to do.  The Mini Rig has a unique form factor. From the side, it pretty much looks like a gaming PC tower. But when you look at the width of the unit, you can see that it is something different altogether.  While Butterfly Labs is catering to the consumer bitcoin market, it's clear that bitcoin mining will eventually not be viable for the mass market. BFL Chief Operating Officer Josh Zerlan made it clear that even if the mining difficulty were to be at a rate over 900 million (it is around 26 million right now), even the entry-level Jalapeno should still be able to make at least a little bit of money.  Mining at home may not last  Of course, those are the company's back-of-the-napkin calculations - it's no guarantee. Bitcoin pricing is volatile, so it's hard to predict the future value of mining. You have to believe that the price of bitcoins are going to be much higher in the future if you want to be a part of the race towards more hashes. The best resource that I have found to be able to work out the variables that go into bitcoin mining is the profitability calculator on Bitcoinx, which takes into account the mining difficulty, a miner's hash rate and power consumption, among other factors. There is also an excellent bitcoin mining dashboard that has been created by TradeBlock.  What the Mini Rig SC does is amalgamate many of BFL's ""longboard"" PCB units. When a customer purchases a Single - the unit that's one level above the entry-level Jalapeno - it comes with one of these boards. The Mini Rig is a bunch of them in a larger configuration connected with a USB. One of the first things that I noticed about the unit is that it would sit quite awkwardly inside of a datacenter rack.  This is important when you start to realize where the future of bitcoin mining lies. For the most part, the past few years have been full of miners building rigs inside of their houses. But with so much power and cooling needs that will be required in the future, it is likely that a future with mining rigs in the home will no longer be possible.  Electricity and heat  It is the power and cooling that will become the most important elements of mining going forward. It will only be a matter of time until a unit is capable of performing at the level of terahashes per second and beyond. While Butterfly Labs did not want to comment on their future plans, they made it pretty clear to me that they are hard at work on developing the next generation of bitcoin hardware.  The key is going to be efficiency, in terms of power and cooling. Unlike the Mini Rig SC, it's highly likely that units are going to need to be configured in a blade form factor that can slide into a datacenter rack. I was told that water-cooling would be the most effective option for heat reduction in the future because it is cheaper overall than technology that utilizes liquid nitrogen cooling.  Even then, a traditional datacenter rack can only handle 20,000 watts of power at a time. According to the Butterfly Labs official FAQ, a Mini Rig consumes 2,500 to 2,700 watts of power at any given time. Right now, that datacenter rack comprising of today's average servers would only be able to handle about six Mini Rigs.  The treadmill  The competition to make bitcoin mining hardware energy efficient yet maintain a high hashrate is going to be important. Cooling is an aspect of this, but it is going to take some creative thinking instead of just jacking up the hashrates. At some point, engineers are going to have to start thinking more about power consumption than hashing.  So here's what is happening with mining right at this moment, a reflection on future things to come. ""The GPU miners are dropping out. The cost of electricity versus the reward is going through the roof"", says McClain, the BFL account manager. Now that ASICs are here, the FPGA mining units cannot survive. This example of what is going on at this moment will in fact be a continuous cycle in what is the bitcoin mining race, an occurrence that the Butterfly Labs folks admitted is similar to a ""treadmill"".  But is that going to stop people from mining bitcoins? Is that going to stop Butterfly Labs, Avalon and Terrahash, among others, from making money selling bitcoin mining to the masses? No, there is too much incentive. And if you believe in bitcoin, perhaps you'll feel a little bit better about it if you own a part of the network.  It at least gives people the opportunity to own a part of financial technology. And that's more than you can say about the banking industry today. You can own shares of a publicly traded bank, but even then that might not be the same thing as being part of a decentralized network, no matter what kind of hardware race might be going on. Actually, it can sometimes be fun to watch technology mature in this form. If you're not caught in the middle of this, it might be kind of exciting.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/22/inside-butterfly-labs-the-asic-bitcoin-mining-arms-race,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1dd48cd8044e788d0b3164be1c8479a8856d5287-1010x623.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397198,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXU6,1374490767,CoinAva allows Iranians to buy and sell bitcoins,"Citizens of Iran now have their own bitcoin market website, CoinAva. The site aims to educate people about bitcoin and allow them to buy and sell the digital currency.  A spokesperson for CoinAva said bitcoin isn't yet very popular in Iran, but said that once a few people start talking about it, its popularity will increase rapidly.  ""When something takes off here, every man and his dog will be totally into it,"" he said.  He went on to say the Iranian government hasn't said anything specifically about bitcoin yet, but he believes it probably thinks digital currency is ""another conspiracy of the USA"".  The Iranian government believes anything based on the internet is suspicious, according to the spokesperson, but he thinks bitcoin has more potential to do positive than negative things for Iran and its government.  ""We are loyal to our country and are doing this because we absolutely believe that bitcoin will be of benefit to Iran. The problem is, Bitcoin's creator is unknown and this has lead to an interesting situation. The US government thinks Iran can use bitcoin to bypass all the sanctions and Iran thinks this is all a game by the CIA.""  CoinAva has been trying to engage with authorities, seeking permission to have a base in Iran, but has made no headway as of yet.  The trading of bitcoins on CoinAva is currently done through a company called Kenn Ava that is registered in Australia, which explains why Australian dollar to bitcoin exchange rates are listed along the top of the site. The site's spokesperson said they chose an Australian company because Iran is less sensitive about Australia than the US, UK, Canada and other countries.  One thing CoinDesk noticed about CoinAva is that its fees are quite a lot higher than those charged by similar sites elsewhere in the world. It charges 4% on the sale and 6% on the purchase of bitcoins, but the spokesperson said this is because ""CoinAva buys bitcoins in Australia and this is the cheapest we can get at the moment"".  He said one of the biggest problems they face is that the local currency - the Rial - fluctuates dramatically against other currencies, which adds to the volatility of bitcoin when traded in the country. To get round this, CoinAva will contact its customers and ask for confirmation before putting a transaction through if the price of bitcoin is far from the price it was at the time of order.  The spokesperson said he was surprised because, so far, CoinAva has had more interest from sellers than buyers. ""This is amazing and it shows that Iranians are up to date.""  This is another great example of bitcoin's increasing global reach. Let us know what's going on with bitcoin in your local area.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/07/22/coinava-allows-iranians-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/001bb0c43f4d19269143da7ef7723f1ee3623b4c-1000x525.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397200,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAakXV5,1374486892,Afghanistan's first recorded bitcoin transaction?,"The sun beat down at a blistering 120 degrees in the Helmand desert. The air was dry and tense as the two bitcoin entrepreneurs, Adam Locklin and yours truly, shook hands and made a deal in bitcoin.  A Partagas robusto cigar traded hands, I sent Adam 0.1 BTC, and so concluded what we believe to be Afghanistan’s first recorded bitcoin transaction.  This simple trade comes with a few lessons if bitcoin is really going to work in Afghanistan and other remote parts of the developing world:  Most countries need an exchange  Adam and I were talking to a few local Afghans the other day, and despite their enthusiasm for the new currency, it dawned on me that they had no practical way of obtaining bitcoin. I could personally take Afghanis, or US dollars, and send over the equivalent BTC, but that didn’t seem like a big enough solution to a huge problem.  Afghanistan needs a local presence, whether it be bitcoin dealers in a modified Hawala concept, ATM’s in fixed locations, or Internet exchanges. The local dealer concept could catch on, given the region’s history with informal, trusted, peer-to-peer cash dealing. Most Afghans don’t have regular web access, and make use of public Internet cafes, so I don’t see exchanges like Mt. Gox, or Coinbase, working for the average Afghan just yet. Give it a ceasefire and a decade, and maybe things will change.  Once Afghans have bitcoin they need an easy way to spend it  I have the Blockchain app on my fancy iPhone, while Adam has a practical Roshan phone that works in Afghanistan. The two devices won’t talk to each other, so we still ended up doing a bitcoin-qt wallet computer transaction.  An African company, Kipochi, just released a bitcoin wallet that piggybacks on the popular M-Pesa cellular system already used by over 10 million people in both Africa and India. M-Pesa has already taken the first steps in integrating with the dominant cellular carrier in Afghanistan, Roshan, so it’s just a matter of time before a service like Kipochi hits the market.  When the average Afghan can easily access a bitcoin wallet over a cellular network, the rate of local adoption in this part of the world will accelerate significantly. Include a familiar method of trading Afghanis, or dollars, for BTC, and this could really take off.
