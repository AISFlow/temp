Related Reading: Analyst Upbeat On USTC, Sees Price Soaring Over 300% Solana‚Äôs Bullish Momentum Solana has come rushing back, increasing 8% in the previous week alone after falling around 8% during the preceding month. Along with a notable change in market mood, this rebound has corresponded with traders and analysts seeing Solana as a cryptocurrency ready for notable increases ahead. For Solana, the recent week marks an actual turning point. Clear indicators point to the bulls in control, so SOL might be set for a significant breakout in the next months. The fact that Solana has maintained a significant support level between $120 and $130 is a really encouraging sign. Assuming SOL maintains a daily candlestick price over $120, bulls may see a clear path for this coin to go to $200 or possibly higher. #SOLUSDTüí∞ Still valid, Bullish until daily candle hold above 120üìàüöÄ ‚û°Ô∏èBuying zone around : 130-120 ‚úÖ ‚û°Ô∏èTarget : 150-170-190-220-250+ ‚û°Ô∏è#SOL is currently tested the daily support zone of 130-120. we might see a bounce towards 180-200 & 250 (Possible 100% pump from current‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/Szyp4y9ywl ‚Äî Crypto Cobra (@Crypto_Cobra_) July 12, 2024 The excitement around Solana goes beyond the near-term pricing behavior as well. Renowned crypto strategist Crypto Cobra made headlines with a wild estimate that SOL might go as high as $400 by late 2024 or early 2025 ‚Äì a possible 200% increase from present values. Promising Future Ahead Solana has no reason it cannot recreate those types of gains if it keeps following the same price trends we have observed in the past. Analyst Crypto Cobra sees a momentum now to propel the altcoin to fresh all-time highs in the not too distant future. Price forecasts from CoinCheckup suggests that Solana is likely to climb 0.78% during the next seven days, landing at $140.58. Looking ahead, the company‚Äôs long-term projection is far more positive: Solana might reach $219.09 within the next year, a 57% rise from present levels. Right now, Solana‚Äôs foundations line up really well. Solana is rapidly challenging Ethereum‚Äôs supremacy with its scalability, low transaction costs, and expanding ecosystem of distributed apps (dApps). And the market is beginning to price it in. Solana: Growing Blockchain Ecosystem Solana‚Äôs capacity to process transactions at extremely fast rates and for a fraction of Ethereum‚Äôs cost is seen by analysts as a major factor behind its recent explosive appeal. Recent integration with prominent DeFi protocols like Uniswap and Aave by the network has also helped increase its user base and trust among crypto investors.

30926248,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629639,1720904431,Why Did The Cardano Price Surge 17% Amid The Crypto Market Crash?,"Cardano (ADA) has recorded a significant 20.29% price increase for the past seven days in line with the current green movement for most cryptocurrencies. ADA trading volume has spiked massively since it bottomed out at $0.335 on July 8, allowing it to outperform the majority of the large market-cap cryptocurrencies. For those wondering, ADA‚Äôs price surge can primarily be attributed to large on-chain transactions in the past seven days. Cardano Outperforming Many Cryptocurrencies Cardano is currently outperforming the market and could continue to do so throughout the weekend and into the coming week. According to the ADA price chart, the cryptocurrency started its uptick on July 8, while most cryptocurrencies were still experiencing price stagnation. This price uptick coincided with the announcement of crucial updates to the upcoming Chang hard fork which represents a pivotal moment for the Cardano blockchain. Related Reading: Market Strategist Predicts 32% Stock Market Crash, How Will This Affect Crypto? As reported by Bitcoinist, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson noted in an AMA broadcast that the upgrade to node 9.0, which is essential for the Chang hard fork, is nearly complete. This appears to have played a part in the start of the shift toward a positive outlook for ADA. Recent price dynamics indicate ADA has kept up this bullish sentiment, with the bulls now in control. At the time of writing, ADA is trading at $0.4249, representing a 32% increase from the monthly low of $0.3213 recorded on July 5. According to on-chain data from IntoTheBlock, this ADA price surge was accompanied by an increase in whale activity on the Cardano blockchain, which likely contributed to the sustained increase. IntoTheBlock‚Äôs data shows that the number of daily transactions greater than $100,000 has increased from 312 transactions on July 7 to 814 transactions on July 12. This is a notable increase of 160% throughout the week. In addition, IntoTheBlock‚Äôs ‚ÄúLarge Holders Netflow‚Äù metric indicates that large holders have increased their holdings by +27.53% in the past seven days. This increase in accumulation by Cardano whales has contributed to a bullish sentiment for ADA, driving the price upward. If this accumulation continues, we could see the large holder netflow flipping into a positive value in the larger 30-day and 90-day timeframes. What‚Äôs Next For ADA? In a bullish scenario, Cardano (ADA) could keep up with the price uptick in the coming week, especially with the entire crypto market starting to turn positive. On the other hand, failure to break above minor resistance at $0.43 could open up a bearish scenario, with ADA reversing its gains. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 2,750% Celestia (TIA) Price Explosion To $188, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap ADA‚Äôs price movement over the weekend could determine how it performs next week. It may continue upwards after breaking above $0.43 to test another resistance level around $0.515, where there are currently 564,830 ADA addresses waiting to turn a profit.

On-chain data shows that these whales have regained their confidence in Dogecoin and are accumulating more DOGE ahead of a potential rally for the meme coin. Related Reading: 6,400 Ethereum Mystery Move Sparks ETH Rally Talk Pre-ETF Nod Dogecoin Whale Accumulation Spikes By 868% Data from the on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock shows that Dogecoin whales bought 364.38 million DOGE on July 10, representing an 868% surge from the previous day when these large holders offloaded 37.05 million DOGE. This accumulation trend continued on July 12 when these whales bought 114.71 million DOGE. These whales are believed to be accumulating Dogecoin ahead of a potential breakout rally for the foremost meme coin. DOGE looks well primed for such, especially with several on-chain metrics turning bullish for the meme coin. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that most holders are again in the money, meaning there is unlikely to be significant selling pressure going forward. The ‚ÄòIn The Money‚Äô metric also shows that the $0.10 support level was a crucial support level that Dogecoin bulls needed to hold, which they did. A bullish reversal is likely at this point, with the bears looking worn out. Other metrics like the bid-ask volume imbalance and smart price also paint a bullish picture for Dogecoin. It is also worth mentioning that Dogecoin looks set for a breakout rally because of its strong positive price correlation with Bitcoin. With the flagship crypto making an impressive recovery and looking to reclaim $60,000, the foremost meme coin could also make a run of its own and rise to new highs. Crypto analyst Kevin (formerly OG Yomi) also confirmed that Dgecoin‚Äôs rally will depend on Bitcoin‚Äôs price movement from here. He stated that the meme coin should bounce from this level and ‚Äúattack the highs sooner rather than later‚Äù once a continuation of a bull market is confirmed. The analyst had previously predicted that Dogecoin could rise to as high as $3 in this market cycle. Not Looking Good But About To Get Better Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa recently admitted that things aren‚Äôt looking too good for Dogecoin at the moment but added that the meme coin will do ‚Äúbig numbers‚Äù later this year. The crypto analyst had previously predicted that the meme coin would eventually rise to $1 in this cycle and claimed that investing in Dogecoin was one of the ‚Äúsafest bets‚Äù anyone could make in this bull run. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Around the Corner?

XRP Breakthrough At $0.466: Analyzing The Surge On the 4-hour chart, the price of XRP has actively risen with strong momentum above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the $0.4663 resistance level. Additionally, it can be observed that the cryptocurrency asset is currently making a bullish move toward the $0.5724 mark. The formation of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) also suggests that XRP‚Äôs price may extend its bullish move toward the $0.5724 resistance level as the signal line of the indicator has been maintaining a steady movement above 50% and is currently trending inside the overbought zone. On the 1-day chart, it can be observed that the crypto asset has been on a bullish move since after the failure to close below the $0.4088 support level successfully and is currently attempting to move above the 100-day SMA toward the $0.5724 resistance level. Lastly, an analytical examination of the formation of the 1-day RSI reveals that XRP could sustain its bullish rally toward the $0.4233 resistance mark as the signal line of the indicator has risen above 50% and is heading for the overbought zone. Potential Risks And Resistance Levels Ahead If XRP can maintain its current bullish momentum to reach the $0.5724 resistance level and close above, it may continue to move upward to challenge the $0.6697 resistance level. If this level is breached, the digital asset may experience further price gain toward the $0.7342 resistance level and possibly other levels above. Conversely, should XRP pull back at $0.5724, it will start to decline once more toward the $0.3389 support level. Furthermore, the crypto asset may see further price decline to challenge the $0.3483 support level and perhaps other levels below if this level is broken.

At the moment, analysts continue to roll out observations and predictions that suggest that Bitcoin may soon pull off a market rebound and perhaps eventually embark on a highly-expected bull run. Related Reading: Institutions Grab Over $5 Billion Bitcoin in a Week: Are They Predicting a Mega Rally? Bitcoin‚Äôs ‚ÄòRare‚Äô Underperformance Hints At Possible Bullish Rebound In an X post on Friday, prominent blockchain analytics company Santiment provided some intriguing insights into Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price behavior.¬†Santiment stated Bitcoin is largely behind the S&P 500 and other equities in relation to price performance, a development which they described as a ‚Äúrare sight‚Äù over the last three years. As earlier stated, Bitcoin‚Äôs current massive price dip can be attributed to a large-scale market sell-off mainly by the German Government who have now completely offloaded their total BTC holdings valued at $2.9 billion. Furthermore, the defunct crypto exchange Mt. Gox which collapsed in 2014, finally began the repayment of a $9 billion debt to creditors in BTC and BCH, the majority of which were expected to be sold, thus a prompting massive selling pressure. While Bitcoin showed some resilience this week gaining by 2.88%, the premier cryptocurrency still trails the positive price performance of the equities market on a larger timeframe. For context, Santiment explains that Bitcoin has declined by 19.4% in the last five weeks while the S&P 500 has recorded a 5.4% gain within that same period.¬†However, as this development has been a rare occurrence in the last three years as both assets usually moved in tandem, Santiment suggests Bitcoin may experience a ‚Äúbullish catch-up period.‚Äù Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Trajectory Remains Bearish, $49,000 Liquidity Zone Looms As Next Downside Target Bitcoin To Challenge 1.5-Month Downtrend In other news, crypto analyst Rekt Capital has noted that Bitcoin is currently battling to end a downtrend stretching over the last one-and-a-half month. During this period the premier cryptocurrency has lost over 18% of its price. According to Rekt Capital, Bitcoin has attempted to break out of this downtrend multiple times including three times in the last three days. If Bitcoin eventually pulls a trend reversal, the market leader may be set for full price recovery reaching as high as $71,000. At the time of writing Bitcoin trades at $58,170 with a 1.69% gain in the last day.

Interestingly, investors seem motivated to keep faith in the altcoin rather than be discouraged by the sluggish price action observed in recent weeks. According to the latest on-chain revelation, investors appear to be shifting to a long-term holding strategy, with a focus on the future promise of the Chainlink token. This leaves the question ‚Äî could the LINK price be primed for a rally? $110 Million Worth Of LINK Leave Centralized Exchanges According to the latest on-chain observation, the Chainlink token appears to be undergoing an accumulation trend, with investors moving their assets from centralized exchanges. Latest data from IntoTheBlock shows that approximately 8.7 Million LINK tokens (worth about $110 million) have been withdrawn from exchanges in the last two weeks. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts 2,750% Celestia (TIA) Price Explosion To $188, Here‚Äôs The Roadmap This observation is based on the Netflows metric, which tracks the difference between the amount of tokens that are transferred in and out of centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric is negative, it implies that more assets are leaving than entering crypto exchanges. Conversely, a positive value of the Netflows metric indicates that more assets are flowing in than out of exchanges. While it is difficult to unravel the rationale behind the increased outflow of Chainlink tokens from exchanges, the exodus of massive LINK amounts signals a shift in investor sentiment. Specifically, the direction of the funds‚Äô movement suggests an increase in investor confidence, as they appear to be moving their tokens away from trading platforms. IntoTheBlock said in the post: Such activity is typically associated with an accumulation phase, indicating that investors are moving $LINK off exchanges and into long-term holdings. A corroborating data point came from another blockchain firm, signaling major accumulation by major Chainlink stakeholders. According to Santiment‚Äôs data, investors holding between 10,000 ‚Äì 1,000,000 coins have added 9.2 Million LINK since June 24. This brings the holdings of this investor cohort to 207.29 million coins, an 8-month high. Chainlink Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of LINK stands around $12.94, reflecting a 3.4% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the Chainlink token is up by 2.5% in the past week. However, this recent show of strength hasn‚Äôt been to reverse Chainlink‚Äôs almost 10% decline in the past two weeks.

30895992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629580,1720857635,"Is Altcoin Season Around the Corner? Bitcoin Halving Points to Potential Boom, Analyst Reveals","Although Bitcoin recent price plunge has sent several Altcoins on a free fall, with declines ranging from 30% to 70%, there appears to be a beacon of hope set to shine through the murk. The recent Bitcoin Halving in April is what the altcoin market needs to recover and surge beyond its highest levels. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Major Gains for These Altcoins But Warn Against XRP and ADA Bitcoin Halving: A Gateway to Altcoin Prosperity? Bitcoin usually undergoes a Halving every four years, and this major event halves the block reward for miners in half. This fall in supply has normally triggered a bullish rally not only for Bitcoin but also for the altcoin market. Crypto analyst Wise Advice elaborates that following each Bitcoin halving, there is a pronounced potential for altcoins to surge. The analyst particularly noted: I know when altcoin season will happen. And I‚Äôll show you it‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòHalving‚Äô It all depends on it When halving happens, after 1‚Äì1.5 years, the BTC ATH come And near that, ETH and other altcoins boom. Historically, this Halving period has seen an explosion of attention for altcoins, driving their prices higher due to the scarcity concerns from Bitcoin following this event. For example, in the previous Bitcoin Halving on November 9, 2021, leading altcoins, including ‚Äî Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), Polkadot. (DOT), Avalanche (AVAX) all recorded a new all-time high. For context, ETH peaked at $4,800 on November 10, SOL came in too with its new peak at $250 5 days earlier as revealed by Wise Advice, while DOT‚Äôs peak at $55 happened on the 4th of that month, and AVAX peak at $144 occurred later that month on the 21st. How Does The Halving Points To Alts Season Now? As Wise Advice‚Äô post suggests, such patterns underscore a recurrent theme: post-halving, money flows from Bitcoin into altcoins, significantly buoying their market positions. The analyst explained: The more they buy, the higher the price goes. And it makes investors profitable. They sell a part of it and send to Ethereum and other tokens. The market cap of these are way lower, so even the inflow of $100 million can make a huge change (a month before the ATH, Bitcoin MC was in 2.5 times larger than Ethereum.) That‚Äôs why Solana and Polkadot‚Äôs ATH was 4-5 days faster. Then money goes to even smaller Alts. And they start to overperform big ones. The smaller they were, the bigger the growth was. Notably, this shift is often reflected in Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance index‚Äîa metric that measures Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies. As observed post-halving, a decline in this index signals a growing interest in altcoins. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000, But What About Altcoins? Bitcoin dominance is now at 54.60%, a slight decrease from above 55%. Earlier this month, according to TradingView. Notably, the fact that the index is still somewhat high, as it still stands above 50%, suggests that the market still favors BTC. However, the recent decrease could be the early signs of an emerging altcoin season. Analysts at Glassnode make a similar point, linking present market circumstances with those in late 2020 when smaller stocks and riskier assets boomed, pointing towards an impending altcoin season. Rotation coming? Yesterday, we saw how #Nasdaq declined >2% ‚Äì while #IWM rallied >3%. This is a clear indication of Rotation. The move to riskier assets. Will we also see this is #BTC and #Alts?

Bitcoin Wallet Now Empty After Massive Selling Spree Data from market intelligence firm Arkham shows that the German government recently transferred the remainder of its 3,846.05 BTC stash worth approximately $223 million to Flow Traders and 139Po, likely for over-the-counter (OTC) services. As a result, Arkham‚Äôs platform reveals that the government‚Äôs wallet now stands empty, with zero BTC remaining, as seen in the image below. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Colossal 280% Breakout Amid CME Group Partnership Interestingly, data researcher Jay analyzed the German government‚Äôs selling activities and found that Germany sold a staggering 42,000 BTC in just one week, averaging 250 BTC per hour over 168 hours. Earlier this year, the German police made headlines when confiscated 50,000 Bitcoin worth $2.17 billion in the country‚Äôs most extensive cryptocurrency seizure. The seizure occurred in January, and the Bitcoin was taken after the suspects voluntarily transferred the funds to official wallets provided by the BKA (Bundeskriminalamt), the German Federal Criminal Police Office. This consistent selling pressure from the German government was notorious for contributing to the significant 25% price retracement experienced by the largest cryptocurrency, resulting in a low of $53,500 not seen since February. Sell Pressure, Support Levels, And Investor Sentiment Crypto analyst SkewA commented on this recent development, noting that in the future, market observers will closely monitor the passive flow of Bitcoin, particularly for signs of reduced supply. According to the analyst, this will serve as a gauge to determine if the market has effectively absorbed the recent sell pressure and highlighted the $60,000 level as the current market supply zone, with the potential for a retest of this crucial level. Related Reading: 6,400 Ethereum Mystery Move Sparks ETH Rally Talk Pre-ETF Nod On the other hand, market expert Dann Crypto Trades notes that Bitcoin is currently attempting to regain support from the May lows. Price action has been volatile in this range, and Dann believes that a true higher timeframe reversal will only occur once the ‚Äúgreen zone‚Äù above $59,000 is successfully recaptured. The analyst sees the $56,500 level as crucial support for BTC‚Äôs upside momentum in the short to medium term. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has identified a bullish sentiment surrounding Bitcoin‚Äôs outlook, noting that the accumulation trend score indicates a shift in investor sentiment after an extended distribution phase since April. At the time of writing, BTC trades at $57,600, remaining in its trading range between this level and the $59,000 zone for the past two days.

However, this crash has not deterred bulls, who believe that this altcoin is set to achieve great things in the market. Celestia Could Explode 2,750% To $188 A recent analysis posted by crypto analyst ‚ÄòHouse Of Crypto Kings‚Äô has caught the attention of the Celestia community. In the post, the crypto analyst maps out a rather impressive path for the coin to rally more than 2,700% and reach brand new all-time highs. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs FOMO: Tron Founder Justin Sun Drops $5 Million On ETH To start out, the crypto analyst lauds the Celestia token for its utility that spans various use cases across the ecosystem. Some of these includes fee payments, staking for rewards, as well as promoting data availability and validation. However, moving to the meat of the analysis, the crypto analyst points out that the altcoin is still holding strong support at the $4.9 level. This was demonstrated in the latest crash this week, where TIA held strong at $4.9 and subsequently bounced above this level. This means that $4.9 is the level to hold if the rally is to continue. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points to the approval of Spot Ethereum ETFs starting an altcoin rally, something that would extend to prominent players like Celestia. ‚ÄúHistorically, new projects introduced shortly before a bull market often experience significant rallies,‚Äù the analyst said. ‚ÄúWe anticipate notable volatility in Q4 2024 and Q1 2025, presenting an excellent opportunity for TIAUSD to surge.‚Äù In the event of a surge, the analyst sets two prominent targets for the price, which are $80.2 and $188. On the lower end of this, the price would have to rise 1,100% from its current $6.6 level. While for the latter, the price would have to rise 2,750% to achieve it. Exiting TIA At The Right Time The crypto analyst‚Äôs prediction coming to pass would mean that Celestia investors are in for a lot of gains in the bull market. However, knowing when to exit a coin is just as important as knowing when to enter in order to secure profits. Related Reading: Forbes Says Shiba Inu Price Will Rise 1,700% To Reach $0.0003 ATH, Here‚Äôs When Given this, the analyst tells Celestia investors that they should be looking to exit their positions sometime between March and August 11 in 2025. This is because this is when they expect the top of the bull market cycle to take place and the altcoin season to come to an end. On the bearish side, however, the analyst explains that if TIA fails to maintain the $4.9 support mentioned above, then the price could break down to the next critical support around $3.6. Nevertheless, the analyst expects this to be ‚Äúa key level from which a bounce is highly probable, given the upcoming significant events and the anticipated approval of Ethereum ETFs.‚Äù Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,ETH | TIA,ALTCOIN | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | TIA,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/2750-celestia-tia-price-188/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

30886675,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629595,1720843247,"Bitcoin Price Trajectory Remains Bearish, $49,000 Liquidity Zone Looms As Next Downside Target","The Bitcoin price has recently shown signs of recovery, climbing back to the $58,000 level after hitting a five-month low of $53,500. However, technical analysis suggests that the digital asset may struggle to surpass crucial indicators, potentially revisiting lower price levels. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), market expert Jackis highlights the bearish D1 trend indicator on the 12-hour chart, indicating the need for Bitcoin to reclaim the $64,000 zone to reverse the prevailing bearish daily trend. Despite this cautionary outlook, there are encouraging signs, including significant inflows to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and long-term holders accumulating more BTC. BTC Struggles To Break Bearish Trend Despite the recent recovery, Bitcoin‚Äôs technical analysis suggests that the bearish trend remains. Jackis emphasizes that even if the Bitcoin price makes a new leg higher to $60,300, the D1 trend indicator remains bearish unless BTC manages to recapture the $64,000 zone, which has already proven to be a major resistance for the bulls, as the price of BTC failed to breach it on its previous attempt on July 1st. According to Jackis‚Äô analysis, the target range for the next daily leg is projected to be between $51,000 and $49,000, with a pivotal level at $63,800 that bulls must target to reverse the daily trend. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes Colossal 280% Breakout Amid CME Group Partnership However, there is potential to reverse this situation as ‚Äúdip buyers‚Äù have returned, resulting in significant inflows into the US Bitcoin ETF market, supporting the Bitcoin price this week to prevent a deeper retracement with consecutive days of inflows to manage selling pressure from the German government‚Äôs holdings. ETF Inflow Data And Bitcoin Price Performance JPMorgan data shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed inflows of $882 million during the week ending July 11, with an average of $175 million per day, marking the highest inflows since May 23. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT ETF and Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC led the surge, attracting $403 million and $361 million, respectively. However, Grayscale‚Äôs ETF continued its trend of outflows, losing nearly $87 million after three weeks of outflows in the ETF market totaling over $1.1 billion. Related Reading: 6,400 Ethereum Mystery Move Sparks ETH Rally Talk Pre-ETF Nod Supporting the bullish outlook, crypto analyst CryptoSoulz conducted an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance in July, finding that long-term holders have accumulated BTC, having purchased over 85,000 BTC in the past 30 days. According to the analyst, this accumulation by long-term holders is a bullish catalyst for the price, indicating confidence in Bitcoin‚Äôs potential. CryptoSoulz, similar to Jackis, suggests that Bitcoin is currently finding support in the higher time frame (HTF), anticipating a bounce from this level, particularly considering the recent bearish news. However, the analyst further explained that if the Bitcoin price fails to hold above the $54,000 zone in the coming days, the next level of support is expected at $49,500. When writing, the Bitcoin price stands at $58,300, surging merely 0.7% in the 24-hour time frame as BTC looks to consolidate above the aforementioned crucial levels.

Particularly, in the past month, these entities with wallets holding 1,000 to 10,000 BTC have shown massive inflow levels that effectively match what was seen during March when US-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) introductions were at their peak. This purchase surge is particularly noteworthy when Bitcoin prices saw a significant dip last week, trading as low as below $54,000 for the first time since February, prompting these seasoned investors to capitalize on lower prices. Related Reading: Bitcoin To Hit New Heights? Analyst Predicts 10x Growth In Few Years ‚Äî Here‚Äôs How Implications Of The Scooped BTC Notably, the recent institutional buying of BTC shows a strategic method to buy the asset even during price drops. According to the data obtained from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant, these large buyers are not just speculating but have a strong belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs future value. These investors have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin in the most recent downturn, showing a different motive behind the purchase than their previous accumulation in past periods. The analyst revealing this in a CryptoQuant QuickTake post noted: Unlike what was seen in March, which was a demand more linked to fundraising, the current institutional accumulation may indicate a true process of ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù in large players. According to the CryptoQuant analyst, the massive Bitcoin accumulation among institutional investors began in March. Despite Bitcoin‚Äôs price decline of more than 20% since then, these investors continued to buy heavily, even during last week‚Äôs dip. The analyst particularly stated: While many novice investors capitulated last week, with special emphasis on coins purchased between 1 and 3 months ago, institutional players made the largest accumulation process since March. Bitcoin Market Performance And Future Outlook Following the notable plunge this last week, Bitcoin appears to have recovered to some extent alone. So far, the asset has reclaimed its $57,000 mark, and it is now looking to trade back above $58,000 with its current trading price at $57,920. The asset is up 0.2% in the past 24 hours and 3.4% in the past week. Prominent crypto analyst Moutsache on X has earlier today revealed an interesting trend for Bitcoin.

30879665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=629532,1720832418,"Crypto Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Decline From Here, But What Happens Next?","The Bitcoin price has crashed back toward the $56,000 level after a brief pump triggered by the CPI data release on Thursday, showing that inflation rates came out at 3%, lower than expected. This bearish trend has continued despite desperate attempts from bulls to keep the price up. Even then, one crypto analyst does not believe that the decline is done and expects the fall to continue from here. Bitcoin Dump Far From Over A crypto analyst on the TradingView website, who goes by the pseudonym ‚ÄòLuca VIP,‚Äô has expressed bearish tendencies for the Bitcoin price going forward. In the analysis, the crypto analyst points out that the reason for the current Bitcoin price fluctuation is the fact that it has hit resistance at $59,000 following the pump. Related Reading: Cardano Sees 1,218% Spike In This Major Metric, Will ADA Price Follow? As a result of this rejection, the cryptocurrency is currently in a consolidation phase, which threatens to continue from here. Furthermore, the BTC price is still showing sideways performance, even after the Thursday surge, which suggests that bears are still firmly in control of the price. Additionally, the crypto analyst maps out a possible decline trend from here, putting it as low as $56,000 until the decline is done. However, what‚Äôs important is what happens after the Bitcoin price hits this expected support level. Luca explains that despite the decline, the BTC price has formed a W pattern, which is historically a bullish pattern. In this case, a bullish reversal is expected that could trigger a retest of the $59,000 level. If the retest is successful, then the crypto analyst puts the Bitcoin price above $60,000 once again. ‚ÄúBTCUSDT may retest the resistance zone at $59,000. A successful breakout above this level could push the price to higher targets, potentially around $60,000 or higher,‚Äù the crypto analyst said. Is It Time To Buy BTC? While the market is still reeling from the Bitcoin price dip, some crypto analysts believe that this is a good time to time. Another pseudonymous analyst who goes by ‚ÄòRLinda‚Äô on the TradingView website shared this sentiment recently. Related Reading: Spot Ethereum ETFs FOMO: Tron Founder Justin Sun Drops $5 Million On ETH According to the analyst, the fall to $57,000 presents a good opportunity to get into position for Bitcoin, especially as the market has been plunged into fear by the continuous sell-offs. Apparently, the BTC price is headed toward a renewal of local highs. RLinda‚Äôs stance is buttressed by the fact that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index has fallen into Extreme Fear, which has historically been the best time to get positioned for cryptocurrencies. If historical trends are anything to go by, then the price could trade sideways for a while before finally finding strong support and seeing a bounce.
