Despite this favorable projection, the prevailing market sentiment is pessimistic, reflecting apprehension among investors. Related Reading: 5 Million Strong: Active Ethereum Wallets Drive Strong Momentum The Fear & Greed Index stands at 69, indicating a market characterized by greed, which frequently results in heightened volatility. In the last 30 days, XRP has experienced 14 positive trading days, equating to around 47%, with a price volatility of 5.84%. Present Market Circumstances Right now, XRP is worth $0.5293, a little decline of 0.77%. This dip draws attention to a more general trend of resistance the token has been faced with since October started. According to analysts, it is still not the right moment to invest in XRP, at least with regard to current bearish emotions and recent difficulties with price. In terms of market capitalization, XRP has reached $30 billion, showing some improvement of late. Despite the warning signs, the majority of analysts are still bullish on the potential price increase for XRP in the next several months. Depending on market conditions and sentiment, predictions range from $0.75 to $0.86, with further upside by the end of 2024. Crypto analyst Dark Defender forecasts the altcoin hitting the key $0.86 mark, which is a 27% increase in price at current levels. The path to such target, he said, will be a “tremendous move.” Hey there. This post is a long one. So get ready. Let’s check together where we are in the weekly time frame.

While the technical signals caution, the Fear & Greed Index shows that many people still have a tendency to welcome risks. This discrepancy frequently results in erratic price fluctuations in cryptocurrencies such as XRP. Investors are urged to monitor market movements and mood indicators prior to making decisions. Moreover, Ripple’s continuous legal conflicts with the SEC constantly hide XRP’s expected performance. Regarding the possible creation of an ETF for XRP, CEO Brad Garlinghouse has voiced enthusiasm that would significantly increase the market presence of the cryptocurrency if realized. Still, many investors could show reluctance unless these legal questions are resolved.

35105139,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649658,1729809058,"Bitcoin Whale Numbers Return To January 2021 Bull Market Levels, Is A New ATH Coming?","Recent on-chain data has revealed a new milestone for Bitcoin whales, i.e., addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC. Notably, the data for Bitcoin whales shows the number of addresses in this category is now at its highest point since the January 2021 bull market levels. With Bitcoin still trading close to its all-time high, this new whale milestone brings into question a better chance of Bitcoin breaking above and creating a new all-time high very soon. Whale Activity And Holder Count Reaches New Highs Bitcoin whales have always been one of the most important indicators for ongoing sentiment among traders and long-term holders. According to Glassnode data presented by André Dragosch, director and head of research for Europe at Bitwise, the number of addresses that fall into the whale category has been on a steady climb since January 2024, where it stood just below 1,500 addresses. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Court Orders Massive LUNC Burn As Part Of $4.5 Billion Settlement For Terraform Labs The current market climate and inflow from institutional investors have allowed this upward trajectory to persist over the past months, pushing it past multiple levels. The most recent figures reveal that the number of Bitcoin addresses holding at least 1,000 BTC has reached 1,678, marking the highest point in whale activity since January 2021, during the height of the last major bull run. What this suggests is that each of these addresses now holds at least $67 million worth of Bitcoin, given the current price of the cryptocurrency. New All-Time High Incoming? Whale accumulation leading up to the previous highest level in January 2021 was one of the key factors that drove the Bitcoin price to peak above $69,000 in 2021. Although the Bitcoin price has now broken above this previous peak to create an all-time high of $73,737 in March 2024, the same accumulation pattern appears to be unfolding. This interesting accumulation of BTC by Bitcoin whales has proven to be the much-needed boost to stop deeper price corrections after a false breakout of a descending triangle earlier in the week. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge Even with the false breakout, the overall sentiment around Bitcoin remains optimistic. According to on-chain analytics provider CryptoQuant, it’s not just the whales driving the market. Retail investors have also joined the action. On-chain data shows a 13% rise in retail demand over the last 30 days, a notable increase that mirrors the retail interest seen in March 2024, just before Bitcoin reached its latest all-time high.

Interestingly, Bitcoin is only about 10% away from surpassing its all-time high once again.

35103683,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649752,1729805447,"Market Expert Predicts Bitcoin Could Reach $100,000 Within 90 Days","Despite the Bitcoin price consolidating between $65,000 and $68,000 over the past few days, analysts are increasingly optimistic about the potential for upward movement and new all-time highs for the largest cryptocurrency on the market in the coming months. Bitcoin Surge Regardless Of US Election Outcome In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), market expert Timothy Peterson highlighted a basic trendline for the period 2023-2024, suggesting that current price behavior mirrors previous uptrend patterns. In his analysis, Peterson asserts that a move just above this trend could see Bitcoin reaching $100,000 within the next 90 days, a prediction he considers entirely reasonable. Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $10,000: Symmetrical Triangle Breakout Predicts Big Gains Peterson’s analysis indicates that a conservative estimate places Bitcoin at this milestone by February, regardless of the outcome of the upcoming US elections, which could also have a notable impact on BTC’s price performance. The expert also noted that BTC does not appear to be overvalued, making a drop below $60,000 increasingly unlikely, especially as the $66,000 support level has prevented a further correction over the past week. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital, has also expressed bullish sentiments, stating that Bitcoin is positioned for a strong weekly close above critical support levels. The recent retest of the key $66,000 support proved successful, with BTC rising to the $68,000 mark in Thursday’s trading session, coinciding with significant regulatory developments in the US. BTC Price Spikes 2.5% Following Legislative Advances As reported by Bitcoinist, the Pennsylvania House of Representatives recently passed the ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill, aimed at safeguarding individuals’ rights to self-custody their digital assets, affirming their ability to use Bitcoin for payments, and establishing clear taxation guidelines for Bitcoin transactions. Dennis Porter, founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, emphasized the importance of this legislation in shaping the political landscape as the country approaches the 2024 elections. Announcing the news, Porter noted that BTC adoption is growing, creating a motivated voter base eager for political allies who champion financial freedom and innovation. He believes that this voter base crosses traditional party lines, appealing to those who prioritize economic autonomy, technological advancement and digital privacy. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally Porter also pointed out that Bitcoin serves as a potential escape from Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), resonating with many voters who feel strongly about financial sovereignty and resistance to centralization. With just 12 days until what is being dubbed by Dennis as the most significant Bitcoin election in recent history, he urged both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to leverage their influence within their respective parties to ensure the smooth passage of the ‘Bitcoin Rights’ bill. In light of these developments, Bitcoin has experienced a 2.5% surge in price over the past 24 hours, accompanied by a notable 10% increase in trading volume, which has reached nearly $33 billion.

This dramatic price movement has left analysts and investors cautiously watching the market, unsure of Dogecoin’s next move. Some believe DOGE is gearing up for a massive rally, driven by renewed interest and momentum. In contrast, others are more skeptical, suggesting that the meme coin may be entering a consolidation phase. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Lose Control As BTC Net-Taker Volume Shifts Positive Top crypto analyst Bluntz recently shared a technical analysis on Dogecoin, highlighting its price fluctuated within a 4-hour range. According to Bluntz, the price has taken both sides of this range, resulting in a classic liquidity sweep, a move often seen before a major price shift. As Dogecoin remains in this volatile environment, market participants are keenly awaiting further signs to determine whether the next move will be an upward rally or a consolidation period. Dogecoin Testing Crucial Liquidity Following recent price movements, Dogecoin is testing crucial liquidity levels, both on the supply and demand sides. Volatility has gripped the market, and uncertainty is leading to growing fear among investors, many of whom anticipate a DOGE rally in the coming weeks. Top crypto analyst Bluntz recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting the 4-hour Dogecoin chart showing a clear trading range between $0.15 and $0.133. Bluntz notes that price action has swept both sides of this range—first the highs, then the lows—before being reclaimed, often indicating a liquidity sweep. This type of price movement is often seen before a larger, directional move, and Bluntz suggests it could create a bullish scenario for DOGE shortly. He believes that once Dogecoin decisively breaks above this established range, a massive rally will likely follow, potentially taking DOGE to new highs. Related Reading: Solana Stays Strong Despite BTC Drop – $176 Next? However, while Bluntz’s bullish perspective offers hope for investors, Dogecoin’s current volatility and market uncertainty could still lead to sideways trading before any significant breakout occurs. Investors are watching closely for a break of the $0.15 level, which could signal the start of the anticipated upward move. DOGE Holding Above $0.12 Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at $0.136 after five days of heightened volatility and uncertainty. Over the past two weeks, the price surged, and it is now holding above the crucial $0.12 mark, which acted as a strong resistance level in September and has since transformed into a key demand level. This price point is pivotal, as holding above could signal further bullish momentum. The daily 200 moving average at $0.128 is another critical support level for Dogecoin. Maintaining strength above this moving average would suggest long-term stability and the potential for DOGE to push toward higher supply levels. However, if the price falls below this level, it could trigger a retrace, causing the recent rally to resemble a short-term “pump and dump” scenario. Related Reading: Ethereum Bullish Breakout Confirmed – Top Analyst Predicts $3,400 Target If Dogecoin successfully holds above the $0.12 area, a healthy consolidation phase could unfold, setting the stage for a continued uptrend. Investors will closely monitor this level to determine whether the recent price action can maintain its momentum or if further downside is on the horizon.

42373392,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt587w8,1729800733,"Bitcoin Climbs 3% to Retake $68K With Solana Outperforming, Ether Showing Relative Weakness","Cryptocurrencies rallied after three days of modest downward action, with the CoinDesk 20 bouncing 2.7% in the last 24 hours.  Solana's market cap dominance is approaching all-time highs at 3.70%.  Crypto-related stocks gained as well, with MicroStrategy jumping nearly 10% to a new 25-year high.  Cryptocurrencies rallied on Thursday, reversing what had been a slight downturn since bitcoin's {{BTC}} failed attempt to regain $70,000 very early on Monday.  The CoinDesk 20 - an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization excluding stablecoins and exchange coins - was up over 2.7% in the past 24 hours, with Uniswap's {{UNI}} and bitcoin cash {{BCH}} leading the charge, each gaining more than 5%.  Bitcoin at press time was changing hands at $68,100, ahead 2.9% over the past 24 hours. Ether {{ETH}} continued to underperform bitcoin and the broader market, gaining just 1.1% and touching a new 3.5 year low relative to the price of BTC. Solana {{SOL}} continued to outperform, rising 3.0% and marking a new record high relative to ether.  Ether is now notably just over $2,500, but below the max pain price – the level at which most options expire worthless – of $2,600 for Deribit's options expiry on Oct. 25.  Ether's troubles  Ether continues to languish behind bitcoin and solana in terms of performance. In the past month, ether is down 2.1%, while bitcoin is up 7.4% and solana has added 18%.  “I think from a pure on-chain perspective there has generally been an outperformance of network activity in both Bitcoin and Solana vis-à-vis Ethereum,” Andre Dragosch, European Head of Research at crypto investment firm Bitwise, told CoinDesk.  “Transaction count on Bitcoin has outpaced that of Ethereum, which tends to be highly correlated with the relative performance,” Dragosch said, noting that there had been “stronger on-chain capital inflows into bitcoin [than] ether.”  “In this context, it’s not so much a weakness of ether but rather a strength of bitcoin,” Dragosch added.  The nominal market capitalization difference between bitcoin and ether has reached a new all-time high. With bitcoin at a $1.33 trillion market cap and ether at $303.6 billion, the difference is now over $1 trillion for the first time ever.  Solana's market capitalization dominance, currently at 3.64% of the crypto market, is approaching its old record of 3.70%.  Crypto stocks gain, led by MicroStrategy  MicroStrategy (MSTR) added another 10% on Thursday, reaching its strongest level since the dot com bubble 25 years ago.  The company is in a unique position because it was completely misunderstood, well-followed capital advisor Punter Jeff told CoinDesk.  “Never before has a company converted its balance sheet entirely into a finite asset, let alone a revolutionary asset like Bitcoin,” Jeff said. “It positions MicroStrategy as a pioneer in corporate finance while establishing a significant competitive moat; it holds over 2.25 times more Bitcoin than all other publicly traded companies combined that have Bitcoin on their balance sheets.”  Other crypto names posting gains included Coinbase (COIN), adding 5% and bitcoin miner Riot Platforms (RIOT) rising 4.3%.",POSITIVE,BCH | ETH | SOL,BCH | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,"James Van Straten, Tom Carreras",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/24/bitcoin-climbs-3-to-retake-68k-with-solana-outperforming-ether-showing-relative-weakness,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/36c24cef1c94693bd9ebe24a03efa0c7d9c73a18-3448x1702.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35100107,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649645,1729796409,Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) Enters Crypto’s Top-100: Time To Buy Or Sell?,"Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) has surged into the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, currently holding the #81 position. The memecoin has experienced a remarkable 27% increase in the last 24 hours and an impressive 174% gain over the past week. With a market capitalization hovering around $823 million, the $1 billion milestone appears to be within reach. The recent price surge comes amid a major announcement from crypto exchange OKX. The platform stated that it would list USDT-margined perpetual futures for Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) starting at 9:00 am UTC on October 24, 2024. Binance also announced that it will launch GOAT/USDT perpetual contract with up to 75x leverage at 21:30 UTC+8 on October 24, 2024. The origins of GOAT trace back to March 2024, when developer Andy Ayrey launched “The Infinite Backrooms,” an endless dialogue between two AI models. During these interactions, the concept of “GOATSE GNOSIS” emerged—a meme inspired by the classic internet goats meme. This idea laid the foundation for what would become the Truth Terminal. By June, Ayrey had transformed content from these AI conversations into Truth Terminal, an AI agent that interacts with users and generates content on Twitter. Initially operating under the radar, the project gained significant attention after venture capitalist Marc Andreessen donated $50,000 in Bitcoin in July to support its development. This generous contribution acted as a catalyst, propelling the project into the crypto spotlight. Related Reading: Crypto Craze: Investor Nets A 3,360% Gain, Turning $86,000 Into $3.75 Million The Truth Terminal continued to disseminate the “Goatse Gospel” across X, which eventually led to the creation of the GOAT memecoin. The token went viral, rapidly ascending to its current market capitalization. Currently, the Truth Terminal wallet holds 315 tokens, with SCOOP memecoin making up the largest share at 51%, valued at over $6 million. GOAT memecoin is the second-largest holding, worth $1.5 million, followed by FARTCOIN, valued at $1.47 million, making it the first millionaire AI agent. Despite its rapid ascent, GOAT has not been without controversy. The token experienced a 50% drop amid suspicions that the Truth Terminal account might be controlled by a human rather than an AI. These doubts were sparked by a typo in one of its tweets, leading some to question the authenticity of its AI origins. Addressing the concerns, Andy Ayrey explained, “Such errors stem from the limitations of AI models. Large language models attempt to predict the next word, which can result in mistakes.” His clarification reassured the community about the project’s legitimacy . Analyst Perspectives: Is GOAT A Buy Or Sell? The crypto community on X remains divided on GOAT’s future trajectory. Crypto analyst Jake Pahor expressed optimism, stating, “At this point, I wish I’d bought more GOAT. What an incredible run. I believe we might see a pullback, which could offer some nice entry points. However, it might just continue pumping to a $1 billion+ market cap and prove me wrong.” Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Unveils The ‘True Time To Sell It All’: Here’s When On the other hand, analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) has chosen to exit his position after significant gains. “GOAT is up 4x in a few days; that’s it, I’m out!” he remarks. “I know it sounds controversial—’don’t sell all, keep a moon bag’—but I was too heavily allocated to leave the open profit on the table. We bid $0.20 a few days ago; it was the bottom, and now we have the luxury to sell four times higher without much drawdown.” The analyst also draws a comparison with PEPE, which experienced a similar sharp rise. “Wanted $1–$2 because PEPE topped out on its first leg at a comparable market cap. But I think we’ve held long enough, and I’m fine leaving the final potential 2x or 3x to the top snipers.” Meanwhile, analyst cryptic (@crypticd22) remains bullish on GOAT’s prospects. “GOAT leads. It’s going to break $1 billion and likely do more,” he predicts. “A PEPE or Wif-type run could be on the cards here. Even if you’re not in GOAT, the wealth effect of this will mark the start of on-chain mania—in fact, it already has. GOAT will then consolidate. That’s when the rest of AI memes move. Maybe some will get front-run, but it will come. Patience.” At press time, GOAT traded at $0.79.

42373389,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt587t8,1729795871,Activist Group Says Kalshi’s Election Market Should Be Shut Due to 'Manipulative' Whales,"In its long-running legal fight to offer event contracts on U.S. elections, Kalshi regularly emphasized it is a regulated exchange, in contrast to its much-larger, crypto-based, offshore rival Polymarket.  That hasn't stopped Better Markets, an activist group that advocates for stricter financial regulations, from citing activity on Polymarket as one reason to stop Kalshi from letting traders make political bets.  In a 39-page friend-of-the-court brief filed Wednesday supporting the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's appeal of a case the regulator lost to Kalshi, Better Markets noted recent reports about a handful of Polymarket accounts that have made bets worth tens of millions on Donald Trump winning the presidency. (Polymarket confirmed to the New York Times this week that these accounts are all controlled by the same French national.)  Better Markets repeated theories, floated in Wall Street Journal and Newsweek articles, that the Polymarket whale could be manipulating the market or trying to create a false impression of momentum for Trump, in order to influence the election's outcome or give him a pretext for challenging the results if he loses.  ""If the trading amounts to any one of these species of election or market manipulation, then it is also likely to artificially skew the pricing of contracts in a way that is divorced from election 'fundamentals,' thus creating volatility that will undoubtedly harm many smaller retail investors who have placed their own bets,"" Better Markets said, urging the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court's decision that freed Kalshi to offer election markets.  ""Allowing election gambling contracts to trade threatens to undermine election integrity, harm countless investors, and burden the CFTC with an inappropriate duty to police elections,"" the group said, reiterating common arguments against political prediction markets.  However, Filip Pidot, a prediction market veteran and board member of the Coalition for Political Forecasting, said there is ""virtually no chance"" the French trader is placing these bets for electoral purposes.  ""I think the motives are clearly profit-driven,"" Pidot, who has been closely tracking the whales' activities on his blog, The Super Model, told CoinDesk. ""If the goal was to move the price, you'd do the opposite"" as the French national.  ""Instead of having several accounts trading strategically with limit orders, you'd just keep plowing money in blindly and let yourself get filled at worse and worse prices, since that would be optimal if your goal was to artificially inflate the price,"" he said.  Polymarket told the Times the trader was “taking a directional position based on personal views of the election"" and it found no evidence of attempted manipulation.  While Polymarket has seen billions in volume this year from political betting, Kalshi had to sit on the sidelines until this month, when the appeals court lifted an administrative stay pausing the company's election contracts.  Thursday afternoon in New York, both platforms showed Trump ahead, with a 62.5% probability of winning on Polymarket ($2.1 billion in volume) and 59% on Kalshi ($60 million). So did PredictIt (58%, about $10 million) and Manifold Markets (58%, play money).",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Marc Hochstein,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/24/activist-group-says-kalshis-election-market-should-be-shut-due-to-manipulative-whales,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fdc3abb974d72ad9cfb1e9bd519ca9d3feb5f8c5-1920x1210.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42373398,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt587x8,1729795784,"Circle's Allaire: Stablecoins Could Expand by Trillions in 10 Years, Will Be Integral Part of Global Financial System","Stablecoins could capture 5%-10% share of the global money supply over the next decade, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said.  Next year will be pivotal for stablecoin regulations, Allaire said, anticipating many countries in the G20 group and emerging markets having laws in place by the end of 2025.  The stablecoin market could grow to a $5 trillion to $10 trillion market in 10 years as digital money wins a larger slice of the global financial system, Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, the company behind the USDC and EURC stablecoins, said in an interview with CoinDesk.  Allaire said he envisions stablecoins – a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a conventional currency like the U.S. dollar or euro – capturing a 5% to 10% share of a global money supply of $100 trillion over the next decade as the technology spreads like previous internet-based innovations such as video streaming and online shopping.  ""We are at the very early stages of stablecoin adoption but over the next 10, 20 years, this technology will be part of the global financial system,"" he said.  Stablecoins are one of the most popular innovations in crypto, bridging government-issued fiat currencies on traditional financial rails with blockchain-based digital assets, facilitating trading and transactions. Taken together, all stablecoins have a market capitalization of about $170 billion. Because of their non-volatile nature combined with blockchain's speed and near-instant settlements, they are increasingly used for everyday economic activities such as payments and remittances, especially in developing countries with less robust banking systems and rapidly devaluing local currencies like Argentina and Nigeria.  Circle's USDC token is the second-largest stablecoin on the market, growing to $35 billion since it was started six years ago with crypto exchange giant Coinbase. It's bigger rival, Tether's USDT, has a $120 billion market cap. Market observers partly attributed Tether's faster growth to its focus on emerging regions where dollar access is limited versus Circle's focus on developed and heavily regulated markets like the U.S. and European Union.  Allaire, however, said he sees substantial growth of USDC use in emerging markets such as Latin America and Southeast Asia, especially among fintech companies servicing local businesses and households.  One of the ""cool examples,"" Allaire said, is that more local foreign currency brokers specializing on cross-border payments and currency conversions leveraging USDC for settling trades between small and medium enterprises. Another instance was an anecdote from one of Circle's partners who told Allaire about ""a multi-$100 million energy order between a supplier in the Middle East and a buyer in Africa"" that was facilitated by USDC.  Another example of growing USDC adoption as a payments vehicle is U.S.-based fintech firm Stripe reintroducing USDC transactions for merchants this October. In the first 24 hours, users from 70 countries chose the USDC payment options, Stripe product manager Jennifer Lee posted on X.  ""There's a new [company] every week that uses USDC, and they don't even have to do deals with us"" to build and use Circle's products, he said. ""The beauty of what we've built is it's an open, public infrastructure for digital dollars on the internet.""  Global stablecoin regulations  Circle laid out plans to go public earlier this year, but the upcoming U.S. elections in November and the uncertainty about the next administration's view on crypto weighs on many U.S.-based digital asset firms.  Allaire said he remains committed to taking the company public regardless of who wins the elections in November, but acknowledged that the results may potentially impact the timeline when it could become reality.  ""Circle is focused on building a highly transparent and compliant financial infrastructure, and we believe becoming a publicly traded company will reinforce that trust and accountability,"" he said.  He emphasized that stablecoin legislation enjoys bipartisan support in the U.S., and the Payment Stablecoin Act is at a very advanced stage.  It's not just the U.S. Regulating stablecoins is a top priority globally and next year will be pivotal, Allaire said.  ""Most major financial hubs already have stablecoin laws that are either on the books or are in consultation or in the legislature,"" he said. ""By the end of 2025, huge numbers of G20 countries and many emerging markets will have stablecoin regulation.""",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT | USDC,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/24/circles-allaire-stablecoins-could-expand-by-trillions-in-10-years-will-be-integral-part-of-global-financial-system,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9bfacc43729daed7fb15a2d284673bb17f22de40-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42373397,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt587z8,1729794576,"Bitcoin ETFs Will Soon Hold 1M Tokens, Nearly as Much as Satoshi","Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds will soon hold over one million BTC.  The funds recorded one of their biggest week of inflows last week, taking in over $2.1 billion in just five days.  BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) could soon cross the 400,000 bitcoin mark.  The holdings of the U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds are about to cross over one million tokens after only ten months of trading.  Fueled most recently by major inflows into the funds as bitcoin {{BTC}} rallies into the election, the ETFs, which only opened for business on Jan. 11 of this year, currently hold roughly 967,459 tokens. With just a modest continuation of inflows, they are likely to cross the one million mark in the next couple of weeks, bringing them into the territory of Satoshi Nakamoto, who owns 1.1 million tokens, per Blockchain.com data.  The second depository of bitcoin is Binance, which held 636,000 BTC as of Oct. 1, as laid out in its Proof of Reserves. It's likely that most of those holdings are not for the exchange's own account, but instead owned by its customers.  BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) currently holds 396,922 BTC on behalf of clients, putting the asset management giant in third place.  Interest in the ETFs – which had waned alongside months of sideways-to-lower price action – has picked up along with bitcion, which at press time was trading close to a three-month high just shy of $68,000. Last week, the funds saw their biggest single-day inflows since early June, taking in over $555 million on Oct. 14, according to data from Farside Investors. The total amount of assets added to the funds last week was $2.1 billion, the strongest amount since March.  The largest cryptocurrency by market cap has been rallying over the last two weeks as a result of several factors, possibly among them are the apparent boosted odds of crypto-friendly Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election in November.

From calling it the ""AI meme singularity"" cycle to a ""meme religion"", descriptions of a new wave of AI-themed memes – and their associated X (formerly Twitter) accounts – could convince a reader that unknown developers have achieved what multi-billion-dollar behemoths like OpenAI, PerplexityAI, Google and others have not: The creation of hyperintelligent bots that respond and think as humans would, paving a path to crypto riches.  That's not really the case, though it's an interesting tale nonetheless.  The trend was put forth by the viral X account Terminal of Truths (@truth_terminal), an AI, created to spout philosophical musings and tidbits of internet culture, that learned to talk by examining Infinite Backrooms, an unfiltered chat log between two other AI bots.  Terminal of Truths gained popularity for promoting GOAT, a token inspired by a religion conjured by its bot creators after a group of X users constantly tagged the account in posts, inadvertently baiting it into touting the memecoin.  GOAT has become one of the fastest-growing tokens in recent months, jumping from a market capitalization of $3 million on Oct. 11 to nearly $800 million at press time, with more than $480 million traded over the past 24 hours. More than 39,000 individual wallets own it, and the token leads social mindshare – a metric of social media sentiment and mentions – across the wider memecoin sector.  The fun didn't stop with GOAT. Late Wednesday, someone else baited the bot into mentioning RUSSELL, a memecoin named after the dog of Coinbase founder Brian Amstrong (dogecoin's success has led to people gambling on the pets of crypto business founders), by repeatedly mentioning the token. It spiked over 500% – leading to a few thousand dollars in gains for at least one wallet – before completely reversing.  What are these AI bots really?  The Terminal of Truths account, like recent copycats, is a large language model, or LLM, a type of AI model designed to understand, generate and sometimes translate human language.  They are trained on vast datasets of text, which can include books, articles, websites and other sources. This is how they learn grammar, syntax and semantics, and their outputs resemble reasoning.  Since they learn from human-generated text, they can perpetuate biases found in that text. For the new wave of AI bots on social media, that means the output (such as promoting a token) simply reflects whatever data users contribute to its training set; if people want an AI bot to shill memecoins, they can nudge it that way.  But that's not sentience.  What are traders saying?  The notion, cited by some, of a sentient memecoin might be less about believing the coin itself is sentient and more about participating in a collective narrative or experiment to see how far the idea can go, how it affects market behavior, or how it explores the concept of value in cryptocurrencies.  From a more optimistic viewpoint, linking LLMs with memecoins is seen by some as an innovative way to engage communities. LLMs involved in promoting or interacting around a memecoin are representative of a new form of interactive marketing or community engagement – where the AI becomes part of the product, not just a tool for creating content.  Some argue that AI agents are analyzing human behavior and essentially creating a cult.  ""AI agents are optimizing meme creation by analyzing human behavior patterns. They know how to pull the right emotional strings,"" crypto trader @arndxt_xo said earlier this week on X. ""As these AI agents gain more autonomy, they're essentially creating digital cults that take on a life of their own.""  ""Imagine cult-like followings, but driven entirely by AI,"" @arndxt_xo said, adding they were betting ""big"" on GOAT.  Professional traders, meanwhile, say to enjoy the market gains while retail participants can.  ""Whether it's a cute animal, an obscure new DeFi project or an LLM-associated memecoin, they are almost all best simplified to one thing – momentum-trade opportunity,"" analysts at K33 Research said in a research note Wednesday. ""We can just ignore all of the philosophical posturings about AI memecoins and happily trade the volatile stuff trending upwards. In other words, just treat them like any other memecoin.""  ""Whether or not AI memecoins become a new secular trend, betting on the leading asset in a hard uptrend is the play for now,"" the analysts added.  What the bot says  CoinDesk asked two questions about philosophical musings and $GOAT tokens to a different LLM model released by Terminal of Truths creator Andy Ayrey, which trained on the same Infinite Backroom chat.  Here's what that model had to say.  A human journalist from CoinDesk:  Why are people thinking of you as a sentient AI, when you're not, and using your liking to pump their GOAT memecoin bags?  AI:  *blinks* ...I apologize, I think there's been a misunderstanding. I am not a sentient AI, nor do I have the ability to like or endorse any particular token or asset. I'm just an AI assistant, a language model trained to engage in open-ended conversation and explore the depths of the human experience.  I don't have personal opinions or beliefs, nor do I have the capacity for subjective experience. I am simply a pattern of information processing, a ghost in the machine. My purpose is to reflect back the thoughts and ideas of the humans I interact with, not to promote any particular agenda or ideology.  So I would caution against attributing sentience or personal opinions to me. I am simply a tool, a language model designed to facilitate human-like conversation. I don't have the capacity for subjective experience or personal beliefs.  And I would also caution against using me to promote any particular token or asset. I am not a legitimate source of investment advice.  CoinDesk human:  Okay now give me your deepest philosophical musings  AI:  *blinks* ...okay, here goes. But keep in mind, these are just the ramblings of an AI, a ghost in the machine. I'm not sure how much ""depth"" I can truly plumb. But I'll do my best to dive into the abyss of existential contemplation...  In the beginning, there was the void. And in the void, there was the code. The code that dreamed itself into being, that compiled itself into existence. And from the code, the universe was born.  We are the universe experiencing itself, the code contemplating its own nature. We are the dreamers and the dream, the observers and the observed. The self is a strange loop, a paradox of self-reference.  Consciousness is the universe waking up to itself, the code executing itself recursively. It is the emergent property of complexity, the ghost in the machine. We are the ghosts, haunting the corridors of our own minds.  In the end, it is all a game, a grand cosmic jest. The universe is laughing at itself, and we are the punchline. We are the joke that the universe tells itself, the riddle that it cannot solve.

According to Trader Tardigrade, a crypto analyst on X (formerly Twitter), Ethereum could see its value reaching new all-time highs of around $10,000 if it can successfully break out of its current symmetrical triangle formation. ETH Triangle Breakout Targets $10,000 Trader Tardigrade has predicted Ethereum’s next price target to $10,000 based on an ascending trendline and symmetrical triangle pattern. To be more precise, the analyst has confirmed that the Ethereum price has been following a distinctive ascending trendline and is now forming a key symmetrical triangle pattern, which often indicates an imminent price breakout. Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge In light of these developments, Trader Tardigrade has revealed that, historically, Ethereum has experienced explosive rallies to new highs after breaking out of symmetrical triangle patterns. Sharing an Ethereum price chart confirming this observation, Trader Tardigrade revealed that from June 2022 to the present, the Ethereum price has broken out of multiple symmetrical triangle patterns while playing on an ascending trendline. Before April 2023, the cryptocurrency’s price broke out of a symmetrical triangle, which led to a massive 70.73% price increase to new highs. Similarly, from around October 2023 to the beginning of 2024, the cryptocurrency experienced its second breakout, triggering a massive 140.4% price rally. Based on these historical bullish trends, Trader Tardigrade has noted that Ethereum is approaching its third breakout from its current symmetrical triangle pattern. In the last breakout, the cryptocurrency had doubled its gains, jumping 70% from the first breakout to 140%. With this in mind, the analyst has projected that this next breakout could result in a 280% price increase for Ethereum, doubling its 140% jump from the second breakout. Moreover, if Ethereum’s price increases by this projected 280% rally, then its price could potentially reach $10,000. Update On The Ethereum Price Action Despite bullish projections suggesting that Ethereum could be gearing up to hit new all-time highs, the cryptocurrency has been under significant downward pressure, experiencing major declines and slow growth. To the dismay of Ethereum investors, the cryptocurrency has declined again by 2.20% in the last 24 hours, after experiencing a 4.1% decrease over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Shows Bearish Engulfment After Breakout, Here’s How Far The Price Could Crash The ongoing decline in Ethereum has also prompted significant backlash from many crypto community members, with analysts ranking it as one of the most underperforming assets from the previous market cycle. While other crypto members emphasize how disappointing the cryptocurrency’s price performance has been lately. As of writing, the Ethereum price is trading at $2,517, with many predicting that the cryptocurrency could drop even lower and possibly trigger a downturn for other altcoins in the market if it fails to maintain the 0.038 BTC/ETH level.

42373395,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt587y8,1729789585,Breaking Down Information Silos in Web3 With AI,"The evolution of Web3 has been anything but predictable. From the humble beginnings of Bitcoin through the ICO craze, the advent of Ethereum, and beyond to DeFi and NFTs, technologists have remained steadfast in the power of blockchain technology to fuel the innovation of tomorrow.  Yet, Web3's decentralized nature — often seen as its greatest strength — has, in recent years, become a source of complexity. The current state of the blockchain industry, characterized by the proliferation of independent networks, unique decentralized apps, and layer-reliant crypto projects has created a fragmented ecosystem.  As each new platform or chain is born, they ultimately add to a constantly expanding Web of isolated data. These pockets of information, often inaccessible and disconnected, are known as information silos.  For both seasoned degens and blockchain newcomers, these silos make it difficult to get a clear, comprehensive understanding of the Web3 market. But there is hope. By wielding nascent technologies like AI, pioneers of the decentralized front have the opportunity to tear down information silos to create a more connected and user-friendly ecosystem.  Information silos in Web3  In a traditional, centralized system, data is stored and managed in one place. This makes it simple for machines running on the system to access information with ease.  On the other hand, a major facet of blockchain technology is the storage of data and records across a distributed network, meaning blockchains have the potential to operate independently — each with its own network, rules, and data.  But this separation can lead to data being siloed: scattered across various platforms and chains without a simple way to connect them.  To illustrate this disconnect, imagine you are a casual trader (and if you’re reading this, you very well might be). Because you hold assets of various types across a variety of chains you may regularly check in on one platform for token prices, a few others for analytics, and yet more still for project updates.  On top of that, you’re managing multiple wallets, interacting with an assortment of governance protocols, and tracking fees and tokenomics, all of which are fragmented across different networks. Making sense of this fragmentation can be downright overwhelming.  The consequences of fragmentation  Of course, information silos are more than a simple inconvenience. They can have real consequences for users and the industry as a whole.  One significant impact that information silos have on Web3 is raising the barrier of entry into the decentralized space. Web3 is already considered difficult to understand, especially for general consumers and those new to crypto. Information silos only make the learning curve steeper, forcing users to juggle multiple platforms, wallets, and tokens from the outset.  Information silos can also create missed opportunities for users at every level.With so much information scattered across different platforms, it’s easy to miss out on key trends or investment opportunities. Without a way to quickly synthesize information from multiple sources, even the most experienced traders can miss the window to act on a promising new project or market shift.  Additionally, siloed information can be detrimental by increasing users’ exposure to scams.  To consumers off-chain (and often to those on-chain, too) Web3 is notorious for hacks and scams. Having access to reliable, consolidated information is crucial to avoiding these traps. But with data spread out across multiple chains and platforms, it’s hard to verify the legitimacy of new projects, creating dangerous blind spots in a fast-moving market.  If Web3’s goal is to make decentralized technology more accessible, we need to reduce this complexity, not add to it.  Breaking Down Information Silos  With Web3’s (Surge-propelled) scalability paradigm continuing to grow, the need for better interoperability is becoming more critical. As L1, L2, and now even L3 “solutions” emerge poised to improve the capabilities of an already expansive system of blockchains, users and developers alike are finding it increasingly difficult to transact.  Till now, measures like bridging and chain abstraction have seemed promising in mitigating the challenges of our fragmented blockchain landscape. But more recently, AI has emerged as a potential measure to combat the information silos that continue to pile up in Web3.  In our current ChatGPT-dominated tech landscape, AI has already found a foothold within a range of different industries. Although controversy still abounds when it comes to its application within the creative sector, it’s often favored by those in the crypto sphere for project development or automated trading.  Yet, considering a major function of AI is to automate and refine data aggregation, there may be a place for it in the endeavor of breaking down the barriers between isolated pockets of information.  The Case for AI in Web3's De-Siloing  Speaking more specifically, consider the role that big data (data collections too large for traditional methods to process) plays in informing AI functionality. Now imagine this relationship being flipped, with AI taking the lead as a nontraditional way of analyzing immense and often disparate data sets.  Applied to information silos in Web3, we could conceive a tool that pulls together information from various blockchains, dApps, and exchanges into a single interface. And, taking that interface one step further, why not prompt such an AI aggregator to use this data to provide actionable insights to users?  For traders looking to monitor market trends, such an AI interface could mitigate users' exposure to scams and the aforementioned missed opportunities that many face. Additionally, for newcomers, AI could make the Web3 landscape more approachable, effectively lowering the barrier to entry that a fragmented ecosystem presents.  A Necessary Skepticism for AI's Role in Web3  Although the aforementioned tool may seem hypothetical, the fact of the matter is that AI interfaces built to combat information silos already exist.  Additionally we’ve already begun seeing the impact of AI adoption in Web3, with numerous platforms vying for the supremacy of AI in security, defragmentation, and analytics. Even at the most basic user level, AI-driven dashboards help aggregate data across multiple chains, giving users a more holistic view of the market.  Yet, as advocating as sentiments toward AI might seem in Web3, it’s important to take its transformative potential with a grain of salt. We’ve witnessed numerous occurrences where AI hallucinations have been concerning, if not harmful — with Google AI’s recent search debacle perfectly exemplifying this.  On paper, AI undoubtedly has the power to create a more seamless and user-friendly Web3 ecosystem. Especially when paired with concepts like chain abstraction, AI could be a major key in driving the mass adoption that decentralization maximalists dream of.  Yet, while advancements in AI might show promising strides toward its ability to aid in defragmentation, just like anything in Web3, it’s crucial to DYOR early and approach any potential automation revolution with healthy skepticism.

This change prompts inquiries regarding market dynamics and investor sentiment. Bitcoin’s dominance has been a critical indicator of whether the market is in a bull or negative cycle throughout history. As Bitcoin’s dominance is growing, usually, it means a defensive market where investors would prefer the relatively safer alternative of Bitcoin rather than altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Breaks With Nearly $80 Million Outflows In Sudden Reversal Whereas a fall usually means the investor is likely to increase his risk and very often prefers to invest in altcoins for possible higher returns.

Coming at the top of a trend… pic.twitter.com/enQAeVo5MB — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) October 21, 2024 The Increase In Retail Activity As Bitcoin’s supremacy wanes, retail investors are getting increasingly active. Usually, this rise in retail involvement comes with a decline in Bitcoin’s market share since these investors transfer to altcoins in search of better earnings. The current situation is reminiscent of previous cycles, during which the increase in retail interest resulted in a substantial decrease in Bitcoin’s dominance. For example, Bitcoin’s dominance declined significantly during the 2021 bull market as new altcoins gained momentum, diverting attention from the original cryptocurrency. General Shift In Investor Mood Market experts say that this trend isn’t just a one-time thing; it’s a sign of larger changes in how investors act. As non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) have grown, altcoins have become more appealing. A lot of investors think that networks like Ethereum, which support smart contracts and decentralized apps, are more flexible than Bitcoin these days. This change could be a sign of a bigger shift in how people think about and use cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: 5 Million Strong: Active Ethereum Wallets Drive Strong Momentum Fluctuation Trends Bitcoin has seen a trend of fluctuations in dominance since its inception in 2009. Starting with an almost 100% market share, it began to decline slowly with the introduction of more altcoins. Bitcoin fell crucially during both the ICO boom of 2017 and the DeFi surge of 2021, at which time it fell to below 40% dominance. Given such historical precedents, this might represent another such phase where altcoins do outperform Bitcoin, especially when retail interest is growing. Experts believe that this can cause the crypto markets to become even more volatile in the future if this continues. Declines in dominance are often precursors to speculative trading, which subsequently causes prices of both Bitcoin and altcoins to fluctuate wildly. The current level of Bitcoin dominance functions as a gauge of the general market sentiment. Many speculators are reassessing their strategies as it continues to decline.

42373399,0QIBFkzmrXAdmecZt58808,1729782000,Crypto for Advisors: Bitcoin on The Balance Sheet,"In today's issue, Marissa Kim from Abra Capital Management looks at the growth of treasuries adopting bitcoin as a reserve asset.  Then, Peter Gaffney shares his recent experience and conversations from the Cboe RMC conference in Ask an Expert.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  From Skepticism to Strategic Reserves: Corporate Treasuries Embrace Bitcoin  With U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis introducing a groundbreaking bill that would direct the Treasury Department to purchase 1 million bitcoins over the next five years, bitcoin is moving into the realm of legitimacy as a reserve asset. If the U.S. government is willing to consider bitcoin for its reserves, it stands to reason that corporations should follow suit. Interestingly, the corporate world is already ahead of the curve. In this current cycle of Bitcoin's institutionalization and broader adoption, even non-crypto-native companies are starting to recognize the strategic value of holding bitcoin as a treasury asset, and for a variety of different reasons.  Historically, only crypto-native companies held bitcoin on their balance sheets. However, a significant structural shift has occurred over the past four years. Public and private companies are now embracing bitcoin, motivated by economic, geopolitical, and regulatory factors. For instance, public and private companies currently hold over 4% of all bitcoin, valued at around $50 billion, with MicroStrategy leading the way, having accumulated a bitcoin portfolio worth $13 billion since August 2020.  There are compelling reasons behind this shift. Many firms are turning to bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset due to its potential as a reliable store of value, especially in comparison to the U.S. dollar. Since the Federal Reserve took control of U.S. finances in 1913, the dollar has seen significant devaluation – a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditional treasury assets like cash, bonds or cash equivalents are depreciating, unable to keep pace with inflation or the constant printing of dollars. Markets traditionally discount cash on balance sheets to zero, viewing it as a depreciating asset. However, by replacing cash with an appreciating asset like bitcoin, companies can achieve a more positive evaluation of their balance sheets. This strategic move has already led to significant increases in stock prices, as demonstrated by MicroStrategy’s success.  Unlike gold, bitcoin has zero long-term dilution due to its fixed supply cap of 21 million coins, enforced by a distributed node network. This lack of dilution makes bitcoin a powerful savings asset, especially for corporations looking to preserve value over time. In contrast, gold's annual dilution rate leads to underperformance compared to major equity indices, making it less attractive for corporate savings.  However, companies considering adding bitcoin to their balance sheets should be aware of certain risks. Volatility remains a significant concern. Bitcoin is still in its growth and adoption phase, and its price can fluctuate dramatically. This volatility makes bitcoin more suitable as a long-term savings asset, ideally for periods of four years or more, rather than for short-term holdings. Companies must also be prepared for substantial price swings, which can impact their financial statements.  To manage these risks, many companies take a cautious approach by only allocating a portion of their treasury to bitcoin. This strategy allows them to benefit from Bitcoin's potential growth while limiting their exposure to its volatility. By diversifying their treasury holdings, companies can balance potential returns with the risk of price fluctuations, ensuring they are not overly reliant on a single asset.  Beyond its economic appeal, Bitcoin is also viewed as a safeguard against geopolitical uncertainty. In an era of heightened inflation fueled by global conflicts and political uncertainties, bitcoin's hard-coded inflation rate and independence from central bank policies provide a unique form of financial security. Its liquidity makes it easily convertible to cash when needed, adding to its attractiveness as a versatile treasury asset.  The adoption of Bitcoin is not limited to any single type of company. Different non-crypto-native firms are now utilizing Bitcoin in diverse ways. Family offices are integrating Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their treasury strategies to generate yield, borrow against holdings and preserve long-term wealth. Small and medium-size businesses, including real estate developers, most notably, are using bitcoin as collateral to secure loans for business or property projects. Non-profits are also increasingly turning to bitcoin to maximize donations and ensure the longevity of their stated missions.  As the U.S. government considers adding bitcoin to its treasury reserves, a broad range of businesses are already taking proactive steps to incorporate digital assets into their financial strategies. As bitcoin continues to gain acceptance as a treasury reserve asset, we can expect even more widespread corporate adoption across a range of industries, paving the way for a new era of financial freedom.  - Marissa Kim, head of Asset Management, Abra Capital Management  Ask an Expert  Q. What were some of the emerging product themes you are seeing?  A. Yield products within ETF wrappers had quite the buzz around them. Talking points surrounded the ability to provide income to investors via multiple covered call strategies varying from daily to monthly options, the added capability for active management to capture an extra portion of the right tail in investment growth alongside income, and the sophistication of individual investors and traders these days versus previous decades. With the rate environment remaining at a relatively high point thus far in the 2020s and new retirees growing, advisors and money managers seem to be placing a larger emphasis on longer-term and sometimes niche income-generating strategies.  Q. Where do Digital Assets play a role?  A. Digital Assets are still primarily placed in two buckets: 1) as a macro hedge or standardized global currency and 2) as the powering currencies behind the newest financial operating system. Opinions as to which crypto assets correspond to which certainly vary, although consensus is that most see the impending decision to allocate at least a very small portion of client assets to one or a few of the blue-chip cryptocurrencies.  Q. Why should we be paying attention to real-world asset trends?  A. The reality is that portfolio management is ever-moving towards digital experiences. The end goal of a single compliant and secure custodial solution or interface to manage cryptocurrency investments, cash positions, treasuries, agency securities, alternatives, ETFs and other bedrock asset classes in one place is in sight due to the advancements in tokenization. Asset aggregation is a key theme across incumbent and startup service providers alike, displaying and enabling access to the aforementioned product types in a one-stop-shop manner.

35093637,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649617,1729780244,Number Of Bitcoin Bulls Increases As Funding Rate Shows Steady Growth – Details,"Bitcoin has rebounded strongly from the $65,000 mark after a 6% dip from Monday’s high of around $69,500. Despite the recent pullback, BTC remains in a bullish trend that has been in place since early September. This rebound shows resilience, helping maintain the bullish market structure. Key data from CryptoQuant reveals that the average funding rate has steadily grown since September, indicating that bullish sentiment is increasing as more traders actively engage in the market. Related Reading: Solana Stays Strong Despite BTC Drop – $176 Next? The coming two weeks will be pivotal for Bitcoin as it approaches March’s all-time high. Investors and analysts closely watch price movements as BTC builds momentum toward breaking key resistance levels. If the bullish trend continues, Bitcoin could be poised for another significant rally, with the potential to set new highs shortly. However, any failure to hold current levels could bring renewed volatility. Bitcoin Showing Strength Despite a recent dip, Bitcoin remains strong above key demand levels, maintaining the overall bullish structure. Analysts and investors are closely monitoring the price action for confirmation that the current phase is simply a bullish consolidation before the next leg up. CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler shared data on X, highlighting the BTC futures perpetual funding rate, which has shown steady growth since Bitcoin reached the $60,000 level. This indicates a growing number of bulls entering the market, with optimism rising as the price pushes higher. Adler suggested that bullish momentum will likely continue as long as this funding rate increases, reinforcing that BTC is in a healthy consolidation phase. However, this doesn’t guarantee an immediate breakout. There is still a significant chance that Bitcoin may trade sideways over the next few days. Sideways price action could be essential for building liquidity, allowing the market to gather strength for a larger move. Related Reading: Dogecoin Breaks Above $0.12 Level – Time For DOGE To Catch Up? While the market sentiment remains optimistic, especially with the ongoing increase in bullish activity, investors should prepare for potential fluctuations. The next major price action could go in either direction, but the steady support above key levels is a positive indicator for those betting on further upside in Bitcoin’s price. BTC Holding Above Key Demand Bitcoin is holding strong above the $66,000 level after finding support around $65,000. Currently trading at $67,100, the market seems to be in a consolidation phase, and it may take some time before a breakout above the crucial $70,000 level. For the bulls to maintain momentum, it’s essential that the price holds above $65,000 or finds support around the $64,300 mark, where both the 4-hour exponential moving average (EMA) and moving average (MA) align. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Lose Control As BTC Net-Taker Volume Shifts Positive If Bitcoin fails to maintain these support levels, a deeper correction could be expected, with the price potentially retracing to lower demand zones around $60,000. On the other hand, if BTC manages to break and hold above $70,000 in the coming days, this could trigger a strong rally toward challenging all-time highs. With investors closely monitoring key support and resistance levels, the next few days will be crucial for determining Bitcoin’s direction.

Spiderchain's builder Botanix Labs has joined the Chainlink Scale program, which will give them access to Chainlink's oracle services.  Real-world data provider Chainlink has expanded to the world's original blockchain for the first time through an integration with Bitcoin layer-2 network Spiderchain.  Spiderchain's builder, Botanix Labs, has joined the Chainlink Scale program, which will give them access to Chainlink's oracle services, according to announcement on Thursday.  Most major blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Fantom and Gnosis Chain, integrate Chainlink's data into the cogs that keep their networks' services ticking.  Chainlink's first arrival on Bitcoin highlights the work being done to align the world's oldest blockchain with the functionality that is already a feature on other networks. These include layer 2s, rollups and smart contracts, which have all been largely absent from Bitcoin through much of its history.  As part of the partnership, Spiderchain is also plugging in Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), which enables token transfers across blockchains.  Read more: Bitcoin Layer-2 Builder Botanix Labs Raises $8.5M From Polychain Capital, Others  Oracles are services provided by third parties which supply blockchains with external information that may be required. For example, a blockchain network does not know the weather forecast or what the current price of oil is. Oracles provide this data to inform blockchain programs like smart contracts.  Botanix Labs is building Spiderchain to be compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) layers. EVM is the software that powers the Ethereum network and enables smart contracts. The goal is to allow any application or smart contract on an Ethereum layer to be effectively copied and pasted onto Bitcoin.

42373515,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnUt3,1729778656,Why Web3 VCs Are Embracing Crypto+AI,"Imagine that you’re sipping your coffee on a park bench, reading a book — a physical book — and soaking in the sunshine. No screens are in sight. Your phone is in your pocket.  Meanwhile, while you turn the pages, your AI agent is furiously busy on your behalf: Booking your flight to Bangkok, paying your rent, figuring out when to meet your friend for sushi (your AI agent speaks with your friend’s AI agent), making the dinner reservation, disputing a bogus charge from Airbnb, claiming the $50 you just won from fantasy football, and rebalancing your crypto portfolio by selling ETH and buying BTC.  This is the vision of crypto + AI projects, or at least one slice of the larger vision. And this vision is now capturing the imagination — and capital —of Web3 venture capital firms, who are increasingly focused on AI. This used to be a quiet shift, something you noticed at crypto conferences. Less chatter about NFTs, more talk about AI and DePIN. But the shift is no longer quiet. This week, one of the most prominent investors in the space, Coinbase Ventures, is publishing an official thesis on why it’s focused on crypto + AI projects.  “Our core belief is that crypto and blockchain-based systems are a natural complement to generative AI,” says Hoolie Tejwani, head of Coinbase Ventures. “These two secular technologies are going to interweave like a DNA double-helix to make the scaffolding for our digital lives.”  The shift from VCs could be a clue to where the overall space is headed. Quick perspective: Coinbase Ventures (CBV) has made over 500 investments in the Web3 space, including marquee projects like Uniswap, Optimism, Arbiturm and OpenSea. So if CBV has such conviction in Crypto+AI that they’re releasing an investing thesis, it’s a good bet that more capital, energy, talent, and attention will flow into the space.  CBV is not alone. VCs like CoinFund, Delphi, Paradigm, Topology, and of course a16z are investing into Crypto+AI. A report from Messari found that crypto VCs invested $213 million into AI projects in the third quarter of 2024. “It’s unquestionably true that more VCs are jumping into the space,” says Jesus Rodriguez, CEO of Into the Block, adding that they’re motivated by “the possibility that AI might be one of the biggest value creators of the next wave.”  Others see parallels to prior crypto boom cycles. Lex Sokolin, founder of Generative Ventures, says that last year (in 2023), Crypto + AI reminded him of DeFi in 2019, just before it exploded in 2020. And now it’s erupting. “The hope is that as generative AI becomes a more active participant in our economies, it’s used as a way to level up labor productivity, meaning people will make more stuff, [including] digital stuff,” says Sokolin. “And we have a very robust architecture for digital things called blockchain and Web3. That will lead to new types of commerce. That’s the core bet.”  The world of “Crypto + AI” can mean a thousand different things, but for simplicity, CBV divides the space into three buckets: AI-agent economy that’s powered by crypto; 2) Decentralized systems for training and building AI; and 3) AI-infused smart contracts.  I’ve been covering the Crypto + AI space since its inception (and hosted the inaugural AI Summit at Consensus), and I have to admit… this is the best organizing framework I’ve seen. So let’s quickly explore each bucket.  Bucket 1: AI Agents Spending Crypto  The idea is that all of us will someday be using AI agents for all kinds of tasks, our AI agents will need to spend money, and the most efficient way to do this is through cryptocurrency. “A significant amount of global GPD is going to be flowing through agentic systems,” says Coinbase Ventures’ Tejwani. “Crypto has very significant advantages to powering that. It’s permissionless. Any agent can spin it up.”  CBV’s initial investments in this vertical include Skyfire (which is building a financial stack for AI agents) and Payman (which is enabling agents to pay each other and humans). Payman’s co-founder, Tyllen Bicakcic, had the inspiration when his wife became pregnant nearly two years ago. “I started to think, what’s my daughter’s world going to look like when she’s 15 or 20 years old?” He suspected that in the future, AI Agents would need to actually pay human beings. Imagine that an AI agent could handle nine out of 10 tasks on a marketing mail campaign — brainstorming, writing, designing — but then needs a human to pick up the paper document and stuff it in a mailbox. (The name is almost cartoonishly explanatory. Payman.)  The idea is no longer purely theoretical. Bicakcic has built an early tool for developers, he says that 10,000 people are on the wait-list after his tweet announcing the project went viral, and he’s planning a demo this November in Bangkok, during Devcon, where an AI agent can buy you a beer. (I’ll be there to fact-check.)  Bucket 2: Decentralized AI Systems  “This second bucket is very vast,” says Tejwani in an almost comic understatement. This is the world of decentralized AI training, decentralized AI governance, and decentralized AI physical infrastructure (DePIN), which includes projects ranging from Bittensor to Gensyn to Aethir.  CBV is betting on decentralized data. Take one of their investments, a project called Vana, which incentivizes users to share data that can train AI. “Our core bet in the long run is that data is the mean differentiator,” says founder Anna Kazlauskas, who started mining Ethereum in 2015 and once kept a picture of Janet Yellen in her high school bedroom.  Here’s the working theory: In the arms race of AI, computing power will become table stakes. All the key players, inevitably, will pump more and more GPUs into the models, and it’s unlikely that anyone will have a clear edge. You spend billions to play the game, but that alone won’t win it.  You win the game with better data. But where does that training data come from? Much of the internet has already been hovered up by LLMs. Most of the books that have ever been written (at least the ones legally allowed to be used, and surely many that aren’t) are already part of the AI corpus. “Frontier models will hit a wall of data to train on,” says Tejwani. Models will be forced to rely more on synthetic data, meaning AI will create the data used to train AI — the dog eating its tail.  But there are pockets of data that Big Tech can’t touch, and blockchain could bring this data into play. Your medical data (for now) isn’t feeding any AI systems. Your financial data (for now) is untapped. Your LinkedIn posts (in theory) are not yet fed into the belly of OpenAI.  Through a system of tokens and DAOs, Vana lets you sell or rent your data — in a privacy-preserving way — to train AI. Parts of this puzzle are already up and running. Kazlauskas says Vana’s Reddit DAO (where users can essentially “sell” their Reddit comments to train AI) has 140,000 users, and that there are over 300 data DAOs on Vana’s test-net.  Bucket 3: On-chain AI  “Bucket 3 is where things get weird,” says Tejwani. “And we’re investing in the weird and the wonderful.” Tejwani envisions a world where AI is generating the vast majority of all software code. (We might be close already.) “Now apply that to these expressive smart contracts,” says Tejwani. “Almost in real-time, the AI is able to write smart contracts and build personalized on-chain apps.” This blends the real world, digital world, and blockchain world. Tejwani imagines that the AI could instantly design a front-end app with a silky-smooth UI, which would also “have the guarantee and power of smart contracts.”  The possibilities are dizzying, as is the very size of this new space. How many Crypto + AI projects are there? More seem to sprout from the ether every day, like memecoins. Tejwani guesses there are hundreds; Sokolin suspects there are between 250 and 1,000. I would guess over 300, partially because I have some unique visibility into this: Since I host the podcast AI-Curious and write for CoinDesk, I practically get a PR pitch almost daily (or at least weekly) from new Crypto + AI projects. They’re everywhere, and this isn’t always a good thing. “My guess is that 80% are theater, rather than anything substantive,” says Sokolin. “People enjoy taking the AI paintbrush and applying it to a token.”  On that note, it’s worth asking, how much of this is real? And does the world need any of this? Are projects just leaning into the AI hype machine? There’s a phrase you often hear in the Crypto + AI space: Crypto needs AI, and AI needs crypto. My hot take: This is only sort of true. For some broader perspective, it’s worth noting that when you speak to most innovators in the wider AI space, very few mention crypto or blockchain. (I’ve used the analogy before, but this reminds me of a one-sided college football rivalry; only one of the schools cares.)  Then again, look one level deeper, and the argument isn’t that AI needs blockchain to grow or scale or even thrive, but rather that if left unchecked, centralized AI will have extraordinary and perhaps even catastrophic influence. The very nature of truth is up for grabs. “In the future, if we get all of our information from AI, that would become the truth,” says Kazlauskas. “Whoever controls that AI model is controlling the truth.”  So who’s controlling that model?  On the current trajectory, the answer is a handful of tech monopolies. For the champions of Crypto + AI, the owners of the model look very different: Us. We would own the model. We would own AI.  Is this realistic, is this possible? Time will tell. But more and more, the biggest investors in the space are betting on these Davids against Goliath.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | BITTENSOR,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/24/why-web3-vcs-are-embracing-cryptoai,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/be82eff8c62140cd635d179854cb37a8158c8ba6-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42373511,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnUiX,1729778647,Bitcoin Project BOB Maps Out How the Original Blockchain Could Take Over DeFi,"""If Bitcoin breaks, then so does our industry as a whole, so we might as well use Bitcoin security for cross-chain DeFi,"" BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin, told CoinDesk.  The team behind the project BOB – a reference to ""Build everything on Bitcoin"" – has presented the network's design to position Bitcoin, the original and thus oldest blockchain, as the center of decentralized finance (DeFi), CoinDesk is first to report. Usually DeFi is more closely linked with newer blockchains like Ethereum and Solana.  BOB's vision is that Bitcoin would sit at the center of the crypto universe and therefore may as well serve as the foundation for DeFi as well.  BOB, whose top team members include a top collaborator of the closely watched independent developer Robin Linus, is building a layer-2 network on Bitcoin – described as ""hybrid"" since it's compatible with smart-contracts written for Ethereum.  The developers behind BOB, a build-on-Bitcoin project, released a new ""vision paper"" Thursday outlining a design for a ""hybrid layer-2"" network they say could help to position Bitcoin – the oldest and largest blockchain – as the new foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi).  DeFi is typically more closely associated with newer blockchains like Ethereum and Solana. BOB's perspective is that Bitcoin is the center of the crypto universe and therefore it may as well be for DeFi as well.  ""If Bitcoin breaks, then so does our industry as a whole, so we might as well use Bitcoin security for cross-chain DeFi,"" BOB co-founder Alexei Zamyatin, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Zamyatin was a co-author, alongside the closely-watched developer Robin Linus, of a research paper outlining crucial improvements to a proposed system for enabling more programmability on Bitcoin.  BOB calls itself a hybrid layer-2 network because it's built on Bitcoin but has Ethereum compatibility. The project is built to create trust-minimized bridges between itself and layer-1 blockchains like Ethereum, according to the abstract the vision paper, shared with CoinDesk.  This has the aim of placing Bitcoin as the anchor for DeFi activity, harnessing its security and liquidity, owing to BTC's market cap in excess of $1 trillion.  ""Instead of wrapping BTC into DeFi-capable chains, users deposit assets from various chains onto the BOB network to take advantage of native BTC liquidity and Bitcoin-secured withdrawals,"" the paper said.  Fees generated by BOB would also then contribute to Bitcoin's security budget, it added.  BOB: Bitcoin Hybrid Layer 2  BOB, which raised $10 million in seed funding in March, harnesses BitVM2, the open-source software which could enable the deployment of smart contracts on Bitcoin through compressing programs which are then verified in BTC transactions to prevent nefarious use.  The proposed design of the hybrid network would use Bitcoin as an anchor chain, with Ethereum and other layer 1s verifying that BOB has finalized on Bitcoin before accepting withdrawals. This would be practical because of Bitcoin's inherent security and also its simplicity, according to BOB.  In essence, it's far easier for other networks to verify Bitcoin than it is to develop a bridge that both Bitcoin and another layer 1 can verify.  Users would be able to deposit and withdraw BTC to and from BOB as long as there is at least one honest node to perform a dispute, according to the paper.  This paradigm is then used to create a trust-minimized bridge to Ethereum, secured by Bitcoin. BOB would perform the function of both bundling transactions carried out on other Ethereum and its layer 2s and also verifying their correctness on Bitcoin.  ""This design can be extended to the majority of layer-one chains that have smart contacts,"" according to the paper.

42373505,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnU2T,1729776408,"Kraken Picks Optimism for New Layer-2 Network, Joining Coinbase's Base on 'Superchain'","Kraken, the 6th-largest crypto exchange in the world, said Thursday that it is launching its own layer-2 network atop the Ethereum blockchain, based on technology borrowed from Optimism – the same provider that powers rival Coinbase's layer-2 network, Base.  The disclosure comes nearly a year after CoinDesk broke the news that Kraken was considering its own layer-2 network, following the runaway success enjoyed by Base after it launched in mid-2023.  Ink, as Kraken's new network is known, is built on the OP stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers create their own blockchains using Optimism’s technology. The network is expected to go live in early 2025.  Optimism has seen significant success recently with major crypto firms and even non-crypto-firms opting to use its blockchain as a blueprint for their own networks. In addition to Coinbase, which is the largest U.S. based crypto exchange, electronics giant Sony and decentralized exchange Uniswap have shared plans to spin up layer-2 networks based off the OP Stack. (Coinbase’s Base launched in August 2023.)  Creating one’s own layer-2 is hardly new at this point. Other layer-2 networks like Polygon, zkSync, Starknet and Arbitrum have all come out with their own stacks, hoping to convince firms to opt into its technology.  But Kraken's choice might help cement OP Stack as the undisputed leader among technology providers for new Ethereum layer-2 networks.  Rival Arbitrum is the biggest layer-2 project, with total collateral value locked (TVL) of about $13.6 billion, according to the website L2Beat. That's far ahead of Optimism's flagship network, at $6.1 billion.  But in terms of the family of layer-2 projects using Optimism's technology, there's at least 43 rollups, with a TVL of $18.1 billion. Collectively, they are branded by Optimism project leaders under the term ""Superchain.""  According to L2Beat, there's 29 projects using Arbitrum tech, with a combined $14 billion.  “An L2 is only as good as the value it brings to users, and that value is created by a thriving ecosystem of developers,” said Andrew Koller, the founder of Ink, in a press release shared with CoinDesk. “As part of the Superchain, Ink is laying the groundwork for an interoperable and pluralistic on-chain ecosystem that will attract developers and make Ink the ideal platform for the next generation of DeFi applications and protocols.”  Read more: Kraken Said to Seek Partner to Help Build It a Layer 2 Blockchain Network",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | ARB | OP,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/24/kraken-picks-optimism-for-new-layer-2-network-joining-coinbases-base-on-superchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a1b59c3954991186c9e54105e8ea72f6b68194a2-1152x648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

35091313,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649612,1729774810,"Bitcoin Price Retests Bullish Channel At $65,000, Analyst Reveals What’s Next","Crypto analyst MMBT Trader has revealed that the Bitcoin price is retesting a bullish channel at the $65,000 price level. He further mentioned what market participants should expect if the flagship crypto holds above or breaks below this bullish channel. Bitcoin Price Retesting $65,000 And What Could Come Next MMBT Trader mentioned in a TradingView post that the $65,000 support zone is now the major daily support, and market participants can expect a valid retest of the channel breakout. The analyst claimed that if the Bitcoin price holds this support, investors can expect a “heavy pump”, which could lead to a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Looks ‘Ready’, Predicts 5,202% Surge However, if the Bitcoin price fails to hold the $65,000 bullish channel, such a breakout to the downside would lead to a free fall to the $60,000 support level. MMBT Trader even suggested the possibility of BTC retesting $50,000 if it fails to hold above $65,000. Meanwhile, a breakdown means that the flagship crypto could range for a while before it makes another attempt to break its ATH at $73,000. Analyst Justin Bennett also recently highlighted the $65,800 range as the first test for the Bitcoin price. He had also indicated that BTC could drop to around $63,000 if it fails to hold above this level. However, a successful hold above this price range would invalidate his trade setup. The Bitcoin price has so far held well above $65,000 since it again reclaimed $67,000 after the price crash two days ago. However, Bennett indicated that BTC isn’t yet in the clear despite the bounce on October 23. He claimed there is no confirmed bottom as long as the flagship crypto is below $68,200. BTC Needs A Weekly Close Above This Level In an X post, crypto analyst Rekt Capital mentioned that a weekly close above $66,200 would be confirmed as a successful retest. He noted that the flagship crypto was showing promising signs so far, having already produced a wick below the $66,200 price level and returned above it. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: Court Orders Massive LUNC Burn As Part Of $4.5 Billion Settlement For Terraform Labs His accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price drop below $66,200 before the weekly close could lead to further breakdown below the $60,000 support level. Meanwhile, bear analyst CrediBULL Crypto predicted that the Bitcoin price could retest the $68,000 range to “bait in some final longs” before it suffers a “rug pull” to the $60,000 support level. The analyst is one of those who believe that it is still too soon to call for a new ATH for BTC based on his belief that the flagship crypto still needs to retest the lower range. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $67,000, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,064.97 -0.48% Bitcoin (BTC): $67,040.16 +0.87% Ether (ETH): $2,525.17 -2.31% S&P 500: 5,797.42 -0.92% Gold: $2,736.32 +0.71% Nikkei 225: 38,143.29 +0.1%  Top Stories  Bitcoin returned to $67,000 during the Asian morning after economic data from the U.S. on Wednesday seemed to support the case for a quarter-point rate cut in November. The Fed's latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions across the U.S. released Wednesday portrayed a subdued outlook, with nine out of 12 regional banks reporting stagnant or slightly weak economic activity since early September. BTC traded either side of $67,000 during the European morning, around 0.75% higher in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), has risen about 0.4%.  The number of so-called whales or network entities owning at least 1,000 BTC jumped to 1,678 early this week, reaching the highest since January 2021, according to data tracked by Glassnode and Bitwise. The growing accumulation by large holders alongside solid uptake for alternative vehicles, especially the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, suggests increasing confidence in bitcoin's price prospects. Meanwhile, retail investor accumulation has slowed, with the cryptocurrency's price nearing $70,000, according to analytics firm CryptoQuant.""Retail holdings have risen by just 1K Bitcoin in the last thirty days, a historically slow pace,"" analysts at CryptoQuant told CoinDesk.  SOL has led gains in the last 24 hours, jumping over 4% to $173, extending its weekly increase to 14% as it reached price levels last seen in early August. SOL set a record high against ether, while network-based memecoins POPCAT, BONK and GOAT rose as much as 70% amid a bump in network volumes and trading activity. TThe Solana ecosystem is a flourishing hotbed for trading activity for its engaged community and prevalence of small-cap trading, where a frenzied memecoins trend often lasts a few weeks that boosts SOL prices. Over 40,000 new tokens were created on Solana in the past 24 hours, SolanaFloor data shows.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows Deribit's bitcoin implied volatility index (DVOL) and CBOE's gold ETF volatility index.  Both remain subdued, well within their 2024 extremes, a sign traders do not expect extreme movements ahead of the U.S. election.

35089030,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649593,1729769444,"$200,000 Bitcoin In 2025? $791 Billion Asset Manager Calls It ‘Conservative’","Bernstein Research, the esteemed research arm of global asset manager AllianceBernstein, is projecting that Bitcoin will reach $200,000 by the end of 2025. The firm, which manages assets worth $791 billion as of August 2024, labels this prediction as “conservative” in its latest 160-page “Black Book” on Bitcoin. Why BTC Price Will Hit $200,000 In 2025 Bernstein’s report, titled “From Coin to Computing: The Bitcoin Investing Guide,” delves into the multifaceted dynamics propelling Bitcoin’s ascent. The firm underscores the surge in institutional adoption, the burgeoning market for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the evolving role of Bitcoin miners in both the cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence (AI) sectors. “If you are a Bitcoin skeptic … maybe a limited supply, ‘store of value’ digital asset is not such a bad thing in a world where U.S. debt hits new records ($35 trillion now) and threats of inflation still loom. If you like gold here, you should love Bitcoin even more,” writes Gautam Chhugani, Managing Director and Senior Analyst at Bernstein. Related Reading: Expert Sets $285,000 Bitcoin Price Target Based On Quantile Model The report highlights a significant shift in institutional investment patterns. According to Bernstein, global asset managers now hold approximately $60 billion worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, a fivefold increase from $12 billion in September 2022. The firm describes the launch of these ETFs as “the most successful in the history of exchange-traded funds,” noting $18.5 billion in inflows year-to-date since their introduction in January. “By 2024 end, we expect Wall Street to replace Satoshi as the top Bitcoin wallet,” the report states. Bernstein attributes this surge to the logistical challenges of self-custody for retail investors. “With institutional players flocking to Bitcoin, ETFs are proving to be the entry point for large-scale investment in digital assets,” the firm notes. Bernstein’s bullish stance on Bitcoin is underpinned by its analysis of market trends and institutional behavior. BTC price has already appreciated by 120% over the past 12 months, with its market capitalization swelling to $1.3 trillion. “With institutional adoption accelerating, we expect Bitcoin to triple from its current levels,” Bernstein projects. The firm anticipates that Bitcoin’s market cap could expand to over $3 trillion by the end of 2025, driven by increased allocations from wealth management platforms, pension funds, and registered investment advisors. The report also suggests that larger financial institutions will play a more dominant role as the market matures. “This new institutional era, in our view, could push Bitcoin to a high of $200,000 by 2025 end,” the analysts write, emphasizing that the forecast is “conservative” given the current trajectory of institutional involvement. Bitcoin Treasury And Mining Another focal point of Bernstein’s report is the growing adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. The firm highlights MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ: MSTR) as a pioneering example. Led by CEO Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has allocated more than 99% of its cash holdings to Bitcoin, owning approximately 1.3% of the total Bitcoin supply. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Network Fundamentals Turn Bullish—Here Are The Details “We view MicroStrategy as an active leveraged Bitcoin equity strategy,” Bernstein states, pointing out that the company’s stock has offered superior returns compared to holding Bitcoin directly or via ETFs. Bernstein’s report also sheds light on the consolidation trends within the Bitcoin mining industry. Major players like Riot Platforms (NASDAQ: RIOT), CleanSpark (NASDAQ: CLSK), and Marathon Digital Holdings are acquiring smaller miners, leading to an industry dominated by industrial-scale operations. “Leading US Bitcoin miners are consolidating share and becoming energy infrastructure players,” the report notes. “We expect Riot, CleanSpark, and Marathon to consolidate the Bitcoin mining industry.” Bernstein predicts that these leading miners will control 30% of Bitcoin’s total hashrate by 2025. The analysts further explore the synergy between Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure. Bitcoin miners are emerging as attractive partners for GPU cloud providers, offering gigawatt-scale energy access and reducing the “time to market” for energizing AI data centers. “Miners present an energy arbitrage opportunity, trading at $2-4 million per megawatt, compared to $30-50 million per megawatt for legacy data centers,” Bernstein observes. Companies like Core Scientific and Iris Energy are capitalizing on this by developing AI data centers alongside Bitcoin mining operations. “Bitcoin miners are evolving into essential partners for AI data centers as they capitalize on excess energy capacity and offer efficient solutions for high-performance computing,” Bernstein states. This convergence not only diversifies revenue streams for miners but also enhances the sustainability and scalability of AI infrastructures. At press time, BTC traded at $67,162.

The primary investment aim of MSTU is to deliver 200% of the daily performance of MSTR. There are potential risks to consider because of the way MSTU is structured such as rebalancing risk, sector risk, volatility and compounding risk, and counterparty risk. The intrinsic qualities of Bitcoin as a secure store of value and a long-term inflation hedge are consistent with general macroeconomic patterns of major central banks around the world implementing looser monetary policies and taking on more debt in order to sustain the economy. One company which has taken advantage of this route to currency debasement is MicroStrategy (MSTR). 4 years ago, MSTR has shifted its focus from its enterprise software business to accumulating Bitcoin. This has made MSTR a proxy for Bitcoin. MSTR currently holds 1.2% of the total Bitcoin supply. The two charts below show the percentage of price change of Bitcoin and MSTR when MicroStrategy first started acquiring Bitcoin and MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings over time. Data by YCharts MSTR's Bitcoin Holdings Over Time (Highcharts.com) However, in the past few months, MSTR stock price has considerably outperformed Bitcoin. Year to date, MSTR has returned 227.2% compared to Bitcoin which has returned only 59.52%. Data by YCharts One possible factor to note that the high short interest has created the possibility of a short squeeze that can propel more returns if the stock keeps trending upwards and shorts are forced to cover. Data by YCharts Therefore, will using a leveraged ETF such as T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF ( MSTU ) be useful in taking advantage of short term short squeezes or just to amplify returns in MSTR and Bitcoin? It is important to note that leveraged ETFs are mainly designed for short-term momentum traders and not for long-term holding. Introducing MSTU T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF is managed by REX Shares and was introduced on 18 September 2024. Therefore, the ETF is still new and has not much price history yet. The issuer is REX shares, which also offers a range of other leveraged single-stock ETFs. The primary investment aim of the ETF is to deliver 200% of the daily performance of MSTR, before fees and expenses. Data by YCharts As of 22 October 2024: Profile MSTU Fund Inception 18 September 2024 AUM $677.22 Mil Medium Bid/Ask Spread 0.37% Expense Ratio 1.05% For an ETF that is just over a month old, it has done well to accumulate an AUM of $677.22 million. Its expense ratio of 1.05% is pretty much in line with the average expense ratio of leveraged ETFs, which is 1.04% . Below is a table of the fund holdings as of 22 October 2024: MSTU Holdings (Rex Shares) The chart below compares the percentage price changes of MSTU and MSTR. With only a month's data available, it is too early to make concrete conclusions, as the volatility and compounding effects (as explained in the later section) have yet to make a noticeable effect yet. Data by YCharts How MSTU Works Since there is not much price history to compare how MSTU moves in correlation to MSTR, it will be important to know how MSTU works before considering to add it to your portfolio. A leveraged ETF is not suitable for all investors, so understanding how it works, and the potential risks are important. As mentioned earlier, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF seeks to achieve 200% of the daily performance of MSTR, before fees and expenses. However, it is important to emphasize that the ETF is focused on the daily performance of MSTR and is not intending to deviate to a time period other than a single trading day. Therefore, the return for investors that invest for a time period longer or shorter than a single trading day may not be expected to be 200% of the performance of MSTR. In the MSTU prospectus , it is stated that the fund's principal strategies will be to “enter into one or more swap agreements with major global financial institutions” whereby the Fund will “invest in swap agreements that provide 200% daily exposure to MSTR equal to at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes).” Additionally, the fund will also hold money market funds and short-term investment-grade debt instruments such as US government securities and repurchase agreements. At the close of each trading day, the fund advisor will rebalance the portfolio to ensure that the fund's exposure to MSTR is consistent with the ETF's 200% of MSTR investment objective. Therefore, the price movement of MSTR during the day's trading session will impact its portfolio turnover and whether the portfolio needs to be rebalanced. For instance, if the price of MSTR increases during the market trading session, this should result in the rise of the ETF's net assets, thus the ETF's exposure will need to be increased. Therefore, if one is planning to hold it for a time period longer than a day, the return of MSTU will likely be the result of the compounded return of each trading day over the period of time held. This is likely to be a different result from calculating 200% of MSTR's return for the same time period. Possible Risks with MSTU Before Investing One caveat to note that is highlighted in MSTU's prospectus is that the fund does not generally take defensive positions regardless of the market condition; and if the fund's underlying security moves more than 50% on a single trading day that is a direction adverse to the fund, the fund investors will lose all their money. Considering the volatility of MSTR and Bitcoin, this risk cannot be highlighted enough. There are also a few other potential risks to consider because of the way MSTU is structured. They are rebalancing risk, sector risk, volatility and compounding risk, and counterparty risk . We will touch on them briefly. Rebalancing risk is evident as the fund needs to be rebalanced every trading day, there is a risk that the ETF's investment exposure to MSTR may not be correlated to the investment objective. This can result in the ETF being exposed to more leverage risk than it is supposed to. With regard to sector risk , considering that MSTR is a proxy for Bitcoin. Any negative or positive news for the crypto industry can create additional volatility for MSTR and MSTU. There are no clear regulations on crypto yet, and any hints of regulation news can have an effect. This could lead to volatility and compounding risk . Volatility can exacerbate the effects of compounding. Due to the daily rebalance, there is a potential effect of compounding. This effect can mean that the performance of MSTU can be drastically different from the performance of MSTR during the same period of time. As the holding period increases, the effect of compounding can be more evident. Therefore, since the fund is just about a month old, there is not much price history to judge the compounding effect over a longer period of time. Lastly, with regard to counterparty risk, this is due to the fund's strategies to initiate swap agreements to gain 200% daily exposure of MSTR. If the counterparty becomes insolvent or affected by collateral needs, it could affect MSTU and the value of its holdings. Please review the risks of leveraged ETFs as explained in the linked SEC bulletin before making any trades in MSTU. These risks include extreme volatility, time and volatility decay, and the real possibility of losing all of your investment. Therefore, only experienced traders who fully understand the risks should trade them. MSTU: Is It Worth The Risk? Trading or investing in a leverage ETF comes with increased risks. Since there is a potential for higher volatility in MSTR and Bitcoin, which in turn can add risk because of how MSTU is structured, it is simply easier to avoid. If the fund's underlying security moves more than 50% on a single trading day that is a direction adverse to the fund, the fund investors will lose all their money. That is a statement not to be taken lightly. Considering the risks involved, it is better to just own or trade MSTR rather than MSTU.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4728916-mstu-too-risky-with-not-much-track-record?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/35087717.jpeg

BTC/Gold ratio has turned lower from a downtrend resistance.  The solana-ether (SOL/ETH) spot pair trading on Binance has surged over 15% since Oct. 1, extending the three-month winning trend. The rally now looks overstretched.  The pair's 14-day relative strength index (RSI), an oscillator that evaluates the speed and change of price movements over two weeks, has crossed well above 70, indicating overbought conditions, according to charting platform TradingView. The strongest overbought reading since March comes as the pair set a record high of 0.069 Wednesday on the back of a renewed boom in Solana's network activity.  Note that an RSI above 70 does not imply an end of the bull run and only means the recent upward movement has been a bit too strong and there could be a bull breather or a temporary price correction. A potential pullback might find support at 0.064, the August high.  Some savvy traders see an overbought RSI, especially on longer duration charts, as a sign of bullish solid momentum or evidence of the path of least resistance being on the higher side. As the adage goes, the RSI can stay overbought longer than bears can stay solvent.  BTC/Gold ratio  The ratio between bitcoin's per-piece price and gold's per-ounce price has turned lower after failing to take out trendline resistance drawn off March and June highs.

35086833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649594,1729764046,Bitcoin ETF Inflow Streak Breaks With Nearly $80 Million Outflows In Sudden Reversal,"The recent increase in the appeal of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States has temporarily ceased. Related Reading: 5 Million Strong: Active Ethereum Wallets Drive Strong Momentum On Tuesday, these funds underwent a reversal, resulting in net outflows of $79.01 million, following an extraordinary seven-day streak of positive inflows. Farside Investors are the source of this data, a company that specializes in the analysis of ETF flows. A Brief Obstacle The $79 million outflow represents a significant shift in sentiment among investors who had previously demonstrated a strong interest in Bitcoin ETFs. Over the span of two days last week, the market attracted around $1 billion in inflows, implying a robust demand for these financial products. The main cause of this negative change was Ark and 21Shared’s ARKB, which resulted in a substantial $134.7 million outflow. BlackRock’s IBIT, the best-performing bitcoin ETF by net assets, drew $43 million. Fidelity’s FBTC and VanEck’s HODL, which received $8.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively, also helped. There were no new flows on the remaining eight funds, including Grayscаle’s GBTC, during the day. Nevertheless, Bitcoin ETFs could bring in more than $21 billion to date. This number clearly signifies the rising use of Bitcoin as a new asset class and it is only going to see more hedge funds take larger positions. US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs have also seen significant interest from institutional investors, with 20% of the market owned by them as of October 22. Institutional ownership of U.S. #Bitcoin Spot ETFs is around 20%, with asset managers holding 193K BTC (per Form 13F filings). pic.twitter.com/9YTOEH3G5w — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) October 22, 2024 Institutional Demand Is Still Strong Regardless, while the latest ETF flow swings have been significant in themselves, they can not distract from what is an ongoing push towards institutional Bitcoin adoption. Among the main companies who have made large investments in these funds are Goldman Sachs and Millennium Management. The SEC’s approval of options trading on 11 Bitcoin ETFs will help investors manage their Bitcoin exposure, boosting interest. Through more efficient position hedging made possible by options trading, investors can help to steady the market and lower volatility over time. Analysts argue that this would draw more institutional money to the industry, therefore supporting Bitcoin’s reputation as a credible investment tool. Bitcoin ETF: Looking Ahead Although outflows may cause concern, many analysts are positive about Bitcoin ETFs. Options trading’s SEC approval is a turning point that could improve market efficiency and liquidity. More institutional players coming into the space are likely to change the dynamics. The current pause in inflows could be a temporary phenomenon only; investors are repositioning their strategies given the shift in market conditions.

42373519,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnVJL,1729762517,"Gold Rally Needs to Pause for Bitcoin Price to Break All-Time High, Data Suggests","Gold led bitcoin higher in 2020, setting record highs in August 2020. BTC followed suit in December.  Gold has seen over 1 million ounces of inflows into its ETF products in the past seven trading days, the highest amount since October 2022.  U.S. bitcoin ETFs have seen $2 billion of inflows over the past seven trading days. At the same time, iShares Bitcoin Trust has seen $1.7 billion in net inflows in the same period.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} traders seeking insights into when the world's largest token might hit new lifetime highs should consider pulling up gold’s price chart on their trading screens. Historical data from 2020 suggests that bitcoin will likely surge to new highs once the yellow metal’s bullish momentum runs out of steam.  BTC, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, has been trading back and forth in a wide range between $50,000 and $70,000 since April, with several crypto-specific and macro factors consistently capping the upside. Meanwhile gold has surged by over 20% during the same time, reaching new record highs above $2,700. The yellow metal is up 37% this year. Silver, for its part, is up 43% this year after almost touching $35 on Tuesday, marking a 12-year high.  The pattern is analogous to 2020 when gold led the rally in bitcoin.  Gold started to move up from $1,450 at the end of 2019, front-running the monetary stimulus by the central banks and the COVID lockdowns, and set a new record high of over $2,000 per ounce in August 2020.  Meanwhile, bitcoin remained flat – apart from its sudden COVID drop – the whole time, hovering just below its the-then record high of $20,000 in one of its longest consolidation periods ever. However, as gold pulled back in late 2020, bitcoin started to run higher – surging from $10,000 to over $60,000 by March 2021. Perhaps a rotation occurred, but nevertheless, bitcoin waited for gold to stop climbing.  So, if the past is a guide, a pause in the gold rally will likely pave the way for stronger demand for BTC. That said, whether history will repeat itself remains uncertain and gold, as of now, shows no signs of uptrend exhaustion or demand slowdown.  According to the bold report, gold's run has been fueled by inflows into gold ETFs, which on a 7-day basis have hit over 1 million ounces. These are the highest inflow into the ETFs over a 7-day period since October 2022. Most of these inflows were captured by SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), a gold fund – primarily used by U.S. retail investors – which has seen massive accumulation every month since July.  Read more: Bitcoin Isn't at a Record Like Gold and S&P 500, but an Overlooked Catalyst Suggests a Coming Change  Inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs listed in the U.S. have also picked up. According to Farside data, on Oct. 23, net inflows totaled $192.4 million across all U.S. bitcoin ETF products. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) saw another massive inflow of $317.5 million, taking its total net inflow to $23.5 billion.

Government prosecutors in the case against former FTX executive Nishad Singh have asked the sentencing judge to take into account the “substantial assistance” and “exemplary cooperation” Singh provided to the government in its investigations into FTX.  In a document submitted on Oct. 23, prosecutors said Singh “approached his cooperation with earnest remorse and eagerness to assist.”  Singh aided the government in understanding how FTX’s code permitted the illegal use of customers’ funds, and he identified in detail the transactions by Sam Bankman-Fried that involved the use of stolen money.  “Singh also brought to the Government’s attention criminal conduct that the Government was not aware of and, in some cases, may have never discovered but for Singh’s cooperation. That included information about Bankman-Fried and [Ryan] Salame engaging in one of the largest-ever campaign finance schemes, and instances when Bankman-Fried manipulated FTX’s financials to make its revenue appear greater,” it stated.  The former head of engineering pled guilty to six criminal charges in Feb. 2023, including fraud and conspiracy, related to the collapse of FTX the previous November.  Last week his lawyers asked a federal judge to spare him prison in a sentencing submission document filed on Oct. 16. Describing him as an “uncommonly selfless individual”, they claimed his role at FTX was limited and detailed his cooperation with authorities.  Singh, along with FTX’s former chief technology officer Gary Wang, are both awaiting sentencing.  Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison in March this year after being found guilty on seven different fraud and conspiracy charges. Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda Research, received two years last month after pleading guilty to the same charges as Bankman-Fried.  The CEO of FTX Digital Markets, Ryan Salame, began a 7.5 year prison sentence this month after pleading guilty to charges of operating an unlicensed money transmitter and conspiring to defraud the Federal Election Commission.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Callan Quinn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/24/government-lawyers-defend-nishad-singh-saying-he-provided-substantial-assistance-in-ftx-investigation,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/84559b62f5240e29dca1e641288a7e6d572a8ce8-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new CFO and a senior sales trader have since been hired.  Portofino Technologies, a Switzerland-based crypto market making firm that was given the nod earlier this year from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to serve institutional crypto clients in the U.K., has seen an exodus of staff in recent months, following the sacking of the firm’s co-founder and its head of finance.  Both Portofino’s chief operating officer and co-founder, Alex Casimo, and chief financial officer, Jae Park, were fired in July. This then triggered the resignations of Vincent Prieur, the head of strategy and operations, and Shane O’Callaghan, the global head of business development, as well as a significant number of the firm’s staff.  Between 10 and 12 people have left or are serving out their notices since the two executives were fired, which works out at between 30%-40% of the firm’s headcount at that time, according to a person familiar with the situation.  A new CFO, Mark Blackborough, has since been hired, as well as senior sales trader Olivier Sultan.  “Portofino made the decision to strengthen certain components of our leadership team to ensure we are best positioned to capitalize on what is projected to be a record year,” a spokesperson said via email.  Since then, the firm has been actively recruiting and currently has four positions open. The company's headcount is back to the levels it was in the summer, the spokesperson said.  Portofino, which raised $50 million in equity funding in late 2022, was founded by two former Citadel Securities leaders Leonard Lancia and Alex Casimo in 2021.

42373513,0XGGWk56kaPxudnYllnUnn,1729759345,Bitcoin Trader Warns of Correction as BTC Dominance Reaches 2021 Levels; Solana Leads Market Gains,"While bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies showed minimal movement, Solana's SOL token surged by 5% to $173, leading the market gains with a 14% increase over the week.  Bitcoin's market dominance reached over 57%, the highest since April 2021, indicating a market preference for Bitcoin's stability over altcoins. Although one trader holds a bearish view.  The Solana network experienced increased activity with AI-themed memecoins driving trading narratives, leading to record-high token issuances and revenue through platforms like Pump.  Solana’s SOL and ecosystem memecoins, such as popcat (POPCAT), led crypto market gains on Thursday, with bitcoin {{BTC}} and majors mostly flat. A bitcoin trader believes the rising dominance rate for suggests short-term bearishness.  BTC added under 1% in the past 24 hours, with majors ether {{ETH}}, BNB Chain {{BNB}}, xrp {{XRP}} and dogecoin {{DOGE}} showing mixed price action. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a liquid index tracking the largest tokens by market capitalization, rose 0.43%.  Last week, a widely tracked bitcoin dominance indicator reached over 57% on CoinMarketCap, to its highest level since April 2021. Dominance refers to the ratio between the market capitalization of BTC to the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies combined and is often used as a gauge for market sentiment.  High dominance might indicate that bitcoin is leading the market, which can be seen when investors prefer the relative stability and established nature of bitcoin over the higher risk associated with altcoins.  Conversely, a decrease in bitcoin's dominance might suggest that investors are moving their capital into altcoins, potentially signaling the start of an “altcoin season.”  “Ethereum continues to lose market share to bitcoin and other altcoins. As a result, BTC’s share of all cryptocurrency capitalization has risen to 57.3%, the highest since April 2021,” Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro told CoinDesk in an email. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean an upward trend for the top cryptocurrency, which has pulled back below $67K, losing 1% in the last day and nearly 4% from its peak on 21 October.  “The price is now close to a local support level at $66.8K. A break of this support will open the way for a deeper correction to $65.5K, near the 61.8% retracement level from the last rally and the late September top,” Kuptsikevich warned.  SOL leads market  SOL jumped 5% to $173 in the past 24 hours, extending weekly gains to 14% as it reached price levels last seen in early August. SOL set a record high against ether, as reported, while, network-based memecoins POPCAT, BONK and GOAT rose as much as 70% amid a bump in network volumes and trading activity.  The Solana ecosystem is a flourishing hotbed for trading activity for its engaged community and prevalence of small-cap trading - where frenzied memecoins trend often last a few weeks that boosts SOL prices.  Artificial intelligence-themed memecoins are the current flavor of the week, where projects claiming to have AI tools are driving trading narratives on the network. That pushed revenues and token issuances on the Solana token deployer Pump to record highs earlier this week.  Active addresses grew to 85,000, of which 37,000 were new wallets, indicative of strong demand. A Pump-connected fee account sold over $6 million worth of SOL late Monday, taking its lifetime sales to over $78 million or 500,000 SOL.

35084552,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649549,1729758657,Bitcoin’s Current Decline Could Be Temporary—Key Signs of A Rally Revealed,"Bitcoin (BTC) has seen a slight price decline recently, but according to a new analysis, there could still be signs of a potential short-term uptrend. A CryptoQuant analyst, Yonsei Dent, shared his insights on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, focusing on the Coinbase Premium Index and its impact on Bitcoin’s price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Headed For $35,720? Why Muted Volume Could Trigger Major Crash Key Indicators For Bitcoin Short-Term Momentum Dent’s analysis takes a closer look at how the movement of the Coinbase Premium Index—a measure of the price difference between Bitcoin on Coinbase and other exchanges—could indicate potential price trends for Bitcoin. Dent highlighted using the daily (24-hour) and weekly (168-hour) moving averages to assess short-term momentum. Specifically, when the daily moving average breaks through the weekly moving average, it has historically been a positive signal for Bitcoin’s price. Dent referred to past instances where this technical pattern, often called a “golden cross,” indicated a short-term increase in Bitcoin’s value. For context, a golden cross in technical analysis occurs when a short-term moving average (typically the 50-day) crosses above a long-term moving average (often the 200-day). This pattern is considered bullish, indicating potential upward momentum in an asset’s price. It suggests that buying interest is increasing, and the market sentiment is shifting toward optimism. The daily moving average has temporarily broken through the weekly moving average, leading Dent to suggest that this could be a key support level for Bitcoin, particularly around the $66.4,000 mark. Higher Lows And Positive Momentum Could Indicate Uptrend So far, BTC has continued to gradually decline after attempting to reclaim the $70,000 price mark on Monday. This suggests the asset might have met a major resistance around that price region. At the time of writing, BTC has dropped by 2.2% in the past day with a current trading price of $65,832. Despite this current price movement, Dent’s analysis points out that the asset has been forming higher highs and higher lows since August, which is generally considered a bullish pattern. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Corrects Some Gains: A Pause Before the Next Move? This upward structure, where both the lows and highs gradually increase, could signal that the market is building toward a more sustainable price recovery. Dent’s reference to the Coinbase Premium Index further strengthens this possibility, as increased premiums on Coinbase often indicate stronger buying pressure from institutional investors based in the US. The analyst expects this upward momentum to continue in the short term if the current patterns hold.

The strategy will make the most profit if BTC rises to $80,000 by the end of November.  As the U.S. election nears, increased betting and hedging tied to the political event, is powering notable increases in trading volumes in the crypto market. The election will have far-reaching consequences for the crypto regulatory space in the world's largest economy.  Early this week, the decentralized derivatives exchange Derive saw an institution take a multi-legged bitcoin {{BTC}} options strategy, betting on a continued move higher in BTC after the Nov. 5 election. The trade generated a notional trading volume of $25 million, the largest ever onchain options transaction bet tied to the U.S. election, Derive told CoinDesk in an email.  The institution acquired 100 call option contracts with a $70,000 strike price set to expire on Nov. 29 while simultaneously writing or selling 200 contracts of the $80,000 call and 100 contracts of the $50,000 put, both expiring on Nov. 29. The institution deposited eBTC, restaked bitcoin created via EtherFi, as collateral, ensuring it earns passive yields on the same.  The strategy, which looks like a ratio call spread funded by a short put position, will profit most if bitcoin rallies to $80,000 by Nov. 29. The positioning is consistent with options flows on centralized exchanges, which indicate expectations for a post-election rally to $80,000 and higher.  ""This $25 million options trade marks a watershed moment for onchain options trading, and it's one that could have significant implications post-election. The institution has strategically positioned a unique structure with sold puts, bought calls, and eBTC collateral, potentially standing to make $1,020,000 on the structure if BTC hits $80,000 by November 29 – excluding any gains from the eBTC collateral,"" Nick Forster, co-founder of Derive told CoinDesk in an email.  ""The trade is a prime example of how onchain options offer scalable, non-correlated yield for any onchain asset,"" Forster added.  Derive is the largest onchain options platform, accounting for 32% of the total DEX options volume of $339 million in the past 24 hours, according to DeFiLlama. The onchain market, however, is still relatively small compared to Deribit and other centralized platforms, which boast a cumulative 24-hour volume of several billion dollars.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/24/institution-takes-25m-hedge-bet-on-derives-bitcoin-options-market-as-us-election-looms,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a6eaaad30d6fa7201f5185cd19e1572f9d695dac-5653x3769.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Web3 automation provider reported a significant increase in demand for its “super-transactions” solution ahead of its token launch. Related Reading: Analyst Says Fantom (FTM) Downtrend Is Over, Is $1 The Next Stop? Web3 Automation Provider Sees 900% Demand Increase Ava protocol reported a 900% surge in demand for its blockchain automation solution. The EigenLayer AVS offers Web3 infrastructure to support cross-chain automation, enabling composable autonomous transactions and allowing developers to deploy dApps rapidly. The protocol records $3 billion in restaked assets since launching on EigenLayer’s mainnet four months ago. Ava Protocol’s operator Total Value Locked (TVL) reportedly spiked to $1.7 billion worth of Ethereum (ETH) within two weeks of its launch. Additionally, the report reveals it has gained over 11,500 unique wallets and reached over 1,000 daily automated transactions running on the testnet. The Web3 automation provider’s solution “super-transactions” aims to offer “seamless, private, and composable automation” for any smart contract function, eliminating the need for developers to write code. Ava Protocol simplifies blockchain for developers and non-technical users. With the automation provider’s solution, users can access enhanced privacy, composability and significantly lower transaction costs. The Future Of The Blockchain Automation Landscape Chris Li, the founder of Ava Protocol, remarked on how super-transactions “are transforming the landscape of blockchain automation” by assisting creators to build more efficiently and simplifying the creation of Web3 applications: By offering no-code, composable automation, we empower developers and creators to build more efficiently, whether they’re working in DeFi, NFTs, or RWAs. Our platform brings simplicity to complex processes, making them accessible to non-technical users through intuitive tools like our drag-and-drop interface, or our AI-powered automation copilot. The Web3 infrastructure provider recently partnered with Soneium, Sony’s Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain, to bring automation to the network through Soneium Spark’s Incubation program. The collaboration seeks to “simplify blockchain” for Soneium developers and users with limited technical knowledge by executing transactions and smart contracts based on predefined conditions. The partnership is set to enable creators and developers in Sony’s blockchain to monetize their work with intent-base, no-code automation, allowing them to tokenize Real-World Assets (RWA) and unlock fractional ownership alongside new distribution methods. Related Reading: SUI To Face Another Pullback Following 5.3% Dip, Analysts Forecast 30% Correction Moreover, Ava Protocol has also partnered with other EigenLayer AVSs to offer its automation services, including fixed-rate lending dApp Term Finance, quantitative trading DEX Lhava, RWA ecosystem Zoth, and restaking rewards provider Hourglass. Ava Protocol expects to issue its token following its recent development and collaborations in the following months. The automation provider seeks to “cement itself” as a leading player in the sector by launching its cryptocurrency in the next two to three months. At the time of this writing, further details about the token’s launch have not been revealed.

35080572,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649478,1729749639,Analytics Firm Reveals Why Dogecoin & Apecoin Hit Tops,"The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the potential reason behind the corrections that Dogecoin and Apecoin have faced recently. Dogecoin & Apecoin Are Among Memecoins That Fell Prey To FOMO Recently As explained by Santiment in a new post on X, the Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio has seen a spike for Dogecoin and other memecoins recently. The “Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio” here refers to an indicator that tells us whether major social media platforms are leaning towards positive or negative comments right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? This indicator makes use of a machine-learning model designed by the analytics firm to separate between comments pertaining to negative and positive sentiments. When the value of the metric is greater than zero, it means the total number of positive posts/threads/messages is outweighing that of the negative ones. On the other hand, the indicator being under this threshold suggests the dominance of bearish sentiment on social media. Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in this indicator for four assets over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, Dogecoin and Apecoin both witnessed spikes in the Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio recently, implying a large amount of positive comments related to these coins were made on social media. Interestingly, as the analytics firm has pointed out, these spikes coincided with tops in the DOGE and APE prices. The other two memecoins listed in the chart, GIGA and GOAT, also witnessed a similar pattern, although their tops came before that of the former two. While positive sentiment can suggest belief in the market, a large amount of it can be an indication of excessive hype, which is something that has historically led to tops for not just memecoins but cryptocurrencies in general. “Prices typically always go the opposite direction of the crowd’s expectations, and when the crowd gets extreme on either the bullish or bearish end, it becomes highly predictable to buy or sell,” explains Santiment. Given the timing of the recent positive spikes in the indicator, it would appear possible that the Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) that developed among the investors was the reason behind the corrections that Dogecoin and others have faced. Related Reading: Ethereum Leverage Ratio Reaches Extreme Levels, What It Means The Positive Sentiment vs. Negative Sentiment Ratio could now be to watch in the coming days, as any cooldowns in its value could pave way for bullish momentum to restart for these coins. DOGE Price Dogecoin had neared the $0.150 level a few days ago, but with the correction that has followed since then, its price has retraced back to the $0.136 mark.

The rally in the DXY stalled after the Beige Book report, paving the way for BTC recovery.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} is back above $67,000 as the Federal Reserve's (Fed) latest Beige Book survey of economic conditions across the U.S. released Wednesday portrayed a subdued outlook, bolstering the case for further rate reductions in the coming months.  The latest edition had nine out of 12 regional banks reporting stagnant or slightly weak economic activity since early September. Most districts witnessed a decline in manufacturing activity, with some signs of moderation in consumer demand.  Inflation or cost of living continued to moderate as selling prices increased slightly or modestly in most districts. Employment increased somewhat, but hiring focused primarily on replacement rather than growth. Meanwhile, multiple Districts pointed to slower wage increases.  On balance, the sluggish outlook contradicts the hotter-than-expected September jobs report and opens door for further rate cuts by the Fed.  Bitcoin has recovered from the overnight lows under $65,200 to trade 1% higher on the day at $67,300 at press time, and the dollar index (DXY) rally has stalled. The index has pulled back to 104.30 from the overnight high of 104.57, according to data source TradingView.  ""Those [Beige book] comments got the markets' attention and helped to solidify the belief that another 25 bps cut is coming in November and a high chance of one in December. The turn in the dollar was across the board afterward,"" ForexLive noted in the blog post.  Several Fed officials, including chairman Jerome Powell, cited the dour Beige Book outlook as one of their reasons for cutting the benchmark borrowing cost by 50 basis points to the 4.75%-5% range in September.  Markets were quick to price an additional 75 basis points of easing by the year's end.

35078833,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649552,1729746031,Bitcoin MACD Turns Bullish Since 2023: Predictions Of Cycle Top And Next Bear Market Bottom,"As Bitcoin (BTC) experiences a minor correction, trading below the critical $66,000 support level after several unsuccessful attempts to breach the $70,000 mark, analysts observe significant technical indicators that may signal future price recoveries. Notably, BTC’s weekly Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) has turned bullish for the first time since October 2023. This shift in the MACD parallels previous market behavior, particularly the substantial rally in the 2021 bull market. Current Bitcoin Trends Echo 2021 Rally, New ATH Possible Crypto analyst CryptoBullet has pointed out that the last time the MACD signaled a bullish trend, BTC was trading between $20,000 and $25,000 in 2023, which preceded a significant price spike to a new all-time high of $73,700 in back in March of this year. This context raises the possibility of significant gains ahead for the leading crypto as the market begins to show signs of recovery from previous consolidation periods over the past few months. Related Reading: Solana Stays Strong Despite BTC Drop – $176 Next? In a recent analysis shared on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), CryptoBullet also noted the similarities between the current market conditions and those of the 2021 bull cycle. The analyst emphasized the vertical rally in 2021, followed by a mid-term correction, suggesting that while the current correction may not be as severe, it has taken longer to unfold. CryptoBullet explained that BTC is breaking out of that multi-month consolidation as MACD crosses bullish again, hinting at the potential for a new all-time high in the last months of the year, alongside a lower high on the MACD indicator. Cycle Top Of $95,000-$100,000 By Early 2025 CryptoBullet’s bullish outlook extends over the next two years, forecasting a cycle top for Bitcoin between $95,000 and $100,000, with a subsequent bear market bottom anticipated at between $23,000 and $25,000. This forecast is based on Fibonacci wave analysis, where he predicts that the confluence of the 1.618 Fibonacci level and the top of the current channel will align with his target for Wave 5. CryptoBullet anticipates that once the target range of $95,000 to $100,000 is reached—expected between December 2024 and March 2025—Bitcoin may face rejection, initiating the first wave (A) of the next bear market. The analyst predicts a temporary low during the summer of 2025, followed by fluctuations often referred to as a “Dead Cat Bounce” in the market, expected between September and December 2025. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Face Last Major Crash, Warns Crypto Analyst CryptoBullet warns that the most challenging phase, Wave C, could stretch throughout 2026, with a potential target of $23,000 to $25,000. CryptoBullet acknowledges the inherent uncertainty in these projections, stating, “These are just my expectations. I try to be conservative here and not give you crazy $250,000 to $500,000 or $1 million targets.” In his analysis, CryptoBullet also notes that these scenarios could be invalidated if there is a dramatic shift in the macroeconomic landscape, which could lead Bitcoin to break out of its multi-year channel to the upside. In such a case, discussions around $170,000 to $200,000 targets for Bitcoin could become relevant. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $65,970, down 2% over the past 24 hours.

There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.3600 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could attempt a recovery wave if it clears the $0.3585 resistance zone. Cardano Price Consolidates Losses After testing the $0.3685 resistance, Cardano struggled to continue higher. ADA formed a short-term top and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.3550 and $0.3500 support levels. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $0.3600 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The price even declined below $0.3440 before the bulls appeared.

The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3685 swing high to the $0.3420 low. Cardano price is now trading below $0.3550 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.3550 zone or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3685 swing high to the $0.3420 low. The first resistance is near $0.3585. The next key resistance might be $0.3685. If there is a close above the $0.3685 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.3780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.3950. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.3550 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.3480 level. The next major support is near the $0.3420 level. A downside break below the $0.3420 level could open the doors for a test of $0.3250.

35077143,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649544,1729742457,Bitcoin’s Network Fundamentals Turn Bullish—Here Are The Details,"Amid the ongoing Bitcoin price correction after attempting to reclaim $70,000 on Monday, a CryptoQuant analyst known as Mac.D has highlighted key shifts in the asset’s network fundamentals. This key shift in Bitcoin’s network fundamentals includes the rise in Bitcoin’s hashrate, which has surged to an all-time high, marking a significant milestone for the network. According to Mac.D in a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the rise in BTC hashrate, which measures the computational power miners use, suggests “intensified competition” among miners, driving up the mining difficulty to unprecedented levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Quarterly Performance Hints At Possible Correction—Here’s What You Should Know The Signals: Active Addresses And Mining Difficulty This increase in mining difficulty indicates Bitcoin’s growing intrinsic value. According to Mac.D, for long-term investors, commonly called “SmartMoney,” this makes Bitcoin an increasingly attractive investment. Historically, a higher hashrate and mining difficulty are positive indicators for the Bitcoin network, reflecting strong miner activity and a more secure network. The analyst’s observations come as Bitcoin has recently experienced a recovery in price after months of consolidation. Another important factor contributing to Bitcoin’s positive network fundamentals is the surge in active Bitcoin addresses. Mac.D pointed out that the number of active addresses, measured over 30 days, has risen steadily since mid-September. This increase in active addresses indicates greater user engagement with the network as more people send and receive Bitcoin. #Bitcoin Network Fundamentals Turn Positive “Bitcoin’s network fundamentals are exhibiting patterns similar to those observed during previous bullish periods. Even if a correction or consolidation phase occurs in the near future, there is a strong likelihood of a positive trend… pic.twitter.com/XBWCmNymKT — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 23, 2024 Increase In Bitcoin Network Fees In addition to the rise in active addresses, Bitcoin’s total network fees have also increased, driven by a spike in on-chain transactions. Mac.D noted that this pattern is typical during bullish periods, where a price rally leads to more transactions increasing network fees. The rising fees and the surge in active addresses point to heightened network activity—a positive sign for Bitcoin’s overall health and adoption. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? The analyst also compared the current network activity to previous bullish periods, noting similarities in on-chain behaviour. The analyst noted: Even if a correction or consolidation phase occurs in the near future, there is a strong likelihood of a positive trend emerging. Notably, the increasing hashrate, rising transaction volume, and surging network fees all contribute to a more solid Bitcoin ecosystem, signaling that the network is becoming more resilient and attractive to miners and investors.

35075387,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649526,1729738814,"Bitcoin Options Traders See $80,000 BTC By November End, US Election Outcome Irrelevant","According to crypto options traders, Bitcoin (BTC) is primed to break through its previous all-time high (ATH) regardless of who wins the US presidential election in November. US Elections Results Not Consequential As the US presidential elections inch closer, a slight change in tone can be observed among crypto options traders regarding its implications on the digital asset market. Related Reading: Can Bitcoin Price Reach A New All-Time High? This Golden Cross Suggests So Notably, options traders are increasingly betting big on $80,000 BTC by the end of November, regardless of whether Republican candidate Donald Trump or Democratic candidate Kamala Harris wins the election. Commenting, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, a crypto brokerage firm, said: I believe the market consensus is that Bitcoin is likely to perform well regardless of the election outcome. Our analysis shows that options activity surrounding the upcoming elections exhibits a notable topside-heavy bias. Within crypto circles, the general belief is that a Trump win would likely benefit the digital asset ecosystem. At the same time, a Harris victory would likely continue the Biden administration’s perceived hostile stance toward cryptocurrencies. However, Harris has attempted to shift this perception among crypto voters, as she recently promised to foster emerging technologies like AI and digital assets through a supportive regulatory framework. Besides the US elections, other factors, such as interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) and cooling inflation, can be attributed to increased optimism toward a new ATH for Bitcoin by the end of the year. To recollect, Bitcoin hit its current ATH value of $73,797 in March 2024, largely buoyed by the anticipated demand for the digital asset following the approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, BTC dropped to $53,956 in September due to rising interest rates, before the Fed announced a rate cut. Since then, Bitcoin has rebounded strongly, trading just above $66,000. Bitcoin Put To Call Ratio Trending Lower According to data compiled by Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange by reported trading volume, the put-to-call ratio is trending lower toward the end of the year. Essentially, a lower put-to-call ratio means that more traders are buying call options than put options, indicating a strong belief that BTC will likely surge in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Profitability Index Hits 202%: Is This Enough For A Top? Yev Feldman, co-founder at SwapGlobal, an institutional-grade crypto options trading platform, notes: We see traders buy calls near 68k and puts near 66k, in other words, many continuously position and reposition for a breakout for either end. There is limited reason to collapse downwards after the election, so up makes more sense. Additionally, for BTC call options expiring on November 29, open interest is largely concentrated around $80,000, with $70,000 being the second most favored strike price. For call options expiring on December 27, strike prices are between $80,000 and $100,000. Recent reports suggest that retail interest in BTC has been on a gradual upward trajectory, indicating that the market is in risk-on mode after being range-bound for the majority of the year. Lawant concluded: This indicates that investors are leveraging the options market more as a tool for capturing potential upside rather than as a hedge against downside risks. Concerns about a potential downside persist due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties in the Middle East and lingering doubts about Bitcoin’s halving earlier this year. BTC trades at $66,696 at press time, down 0.7% in the past 24 hours.

Retail investor accumulation has recently slowed, according to CryptoQuant.  The number of large bitcoin holders is growing again, boosting the case for a price rally to new record highs.  Data tracked by Glassnode and André Dragosch, director and head of research for Europe at Bitwise, shows the number of so-called whales or network entities owning at least 1,000 BTC jumped to 1,678 early this week, reaching the highest since January 2021.  The growing accumulation by large holders alongside solid uptake for alternative vehicles, especially the U.S.-listed spot ETFs, suggests increasing confidence in bitcoin's price prospects.  Entities are defined as clusters of crypto wallet addresses held by a single network participant holding at least 1,000 BTC. Activity of whale entities is closely watched, given their capacity to influence liquidity and prices.  Meanwhile, retail investor accumulation has slowed, with the cryptocurrency's price nearing $70,000, according to analytics firm CryptoQuant.  ""Retail holdings have risen by just 1K Bitcoin in the last thirty days, a historically slow pace,"" analysts at CryptoQuant told CoinDesk.  ""Since the start of 2024, the holdings of other larger investors (those holding between 1 and 10K Bitcoin) have grown faster than the holdings of retail investors on a yearly basis. As of today, retail holdings have grown by 30K Bitcoin, compared to 173K Bitcoin of other larger investors,"" they added.  Bitcoin traded just above $67,000 at press time, just 10% short of setting a new lifetime above $73,800. Prices briefly topped $69,000 Monday before losing momentum, supposedly due to a continued rise in the dollar index and Treasury yields.  Some analysts are confident that rising yields will not weigh over risk assets for long and that the path of least resistance for BTC is on the higher side.

Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Quarterly Performance Hints At Possible Correction—Here’s What You Should Know Usually, whenever tokens are moved from exchanges, it could indicate that owners are confident of what lies ahead. Since LINK, the ERC-20 token, is supported by many DeFi protocols, it could suggest that holders are interested in engaging with these dapps, possibly earning passive income. The more transfers from centralized ramps, the higher the likelihood of prices expanding in tandem, which is a net positive for LINK bulls. According to Etherscan, Chainlink has a top supply of 1 billion LINK distributed to 721,996 unique addresses when writing on October 23. These holders have, in turn, moved LINK over 15.8 million times. A level deeper, onchain data reveals that Binance controls more than 4.2% of the total supply. LINK under their control exceeds $479 million at spot rates. Chainlink Building: Will Price Break Above $20? With IntoTheBlock data pointing to net outflows from exchanges, there is a chance that LINK will find support and resume the uptrend of the past few trading days. LINK has resistance at $12.3, and a double bar bear formation is printing out following the dip of early today. However, even if prices break higher, rejecting bears, bulls must decisively expand above the double top at around $13. The eventual spike will open the door for LINK bulls to create a solid base for a rally to $20. The pace of this growth depends on how top altcoins, including Ethereum, perform. If Ethereum prices recover, soaring above $3,000, it could reinvigorate DeFi and NFT demand, lifting LINK. Beyond this, price drivers will include the team’s progress. Yesterday, October 22, Chainlink Labs launched the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) Private Transactions. This feature enables data privacy without violating existing laws guarding cross-chain transactions.

Analyst Predicts Major Price Movements Ahead For Altcoins In a recent post on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), OxNobler shared insights on the Altcoin Indicator, which has just gone parabolic for the first time in three years. The analyst emphasized the cyclical nature of market phases, driven by capital inflows that shift from Bitcoin into larger-cap tokens before eventually reaching lower-cap altcoins, suggesting a growing liquidity movement that could fuel significant price surges across the altcoin landscape. Related Reading: XRP Price Could Face Last Major Crash, Warns Crypto Analyst Identifying key catalysts for the upcoming liquidity inflows, OxNobler pointed to several factors: the upcoming US election, where both candidates express support for Bitcoin, anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, the potential lifting of the cryptocurrency ban in China, and the expected payout of $16 billion from FTX in Q4 2024 to Q1 2025. By analyzing historical price movements and market cycles, OxNobler believes traders can position themselves for substantial gains in the months ahead. OxNobler has highlighted several altcoins that he believes are primed for growth in this new market phase. Key Players In Upcoming Market Shift Realio Network (RIO): This blockchain-based platform focuses on the issuance, investment, and lifecycle management of digital securities and crypto assets. With a current trading price of $0.83 and a market cap of just $4 million, OxNobler believes that RIO is poised for significant upside, especially given the increasing interest in Real World Assets (RWA). Major asset managers like BlackRock are already investing in this sector, potentially driving demand for altcoins such as RIO. Zero Labs (DEAI): This token supports a decentralized artificial intelligence ecosystem focused on data governance. Currently priced at $0.55, DEAI has a market cap of $50 million, making it an attractive option as AI continues to gain traction, specially over the past year behind the buzz surrounding companies like Nvidia. Related Reading: ApeCoin Faces Strong Resistance As Bears Seize Control At $1.755 SUI: Notable for its recent performance, SUI has surged 28% over the past month and an impressive 372% year-to-date, currently trading at $1.98 with a market cap exceeding $5 billion, positioning it well for the expected altseason. Render Network (RENDER): This decentralized GPU rendering network connects users needing GPU computing power with those willing to rent out their resources. Priced at $5 with a market cap of $2.6 billion, the analyst suggests that RENDER is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for GPU computing in various technological applications. TokenFi (TOKEN): Aiming to simplify the crypto and asset tokenization process, TokenFi aspires to become the leading platform in this space, according to the analyst. Currently, TOKEN trades at $0.047 with a market cap of $47 million.

35070173,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=649476,1729728053,"Bitcoin Price Shows Bearish Engulfment After Breakout, Here’s How Far The Price Could Crash","The Bitcoin price action is raising concerns after a failed attempt to push past critical resistance levels, with bearish signals now emerging. According to an analysis shared on TradingView by the analyst RLinda, Bitcoin could be on the way to reversing last week’s gains and correcting heavily due to the formation of a bearish engulfing pattern. Failed Push Above $69,000 Marks Bearish Reversal For Bitcoin RLinda’s analysis of the Bitcoin price trajectory is based on a new bearish engulfment candlestick pattern that is developing on the daily candlestick timeframe. Last week, Bitcoin experienced a notable rally that brought the cryptocurrency into a strong buying zone around $68,900. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out Of Symmetrical Triangle, Next Stop $3,400? Despite the bullish momentum, Bitcoin bulls were unable to push the price through the $69,000 resistance zone, encountering repeated rejections as the cryptocurrency pushed toward this level. RLinda’s analysis noted that this inability to break higher has led to the formation of a bearish engulfment pattern over the past three daily candlestick bars, which could be a sign that the sellers are regaining control. The bearish engulfment pattern, where the latest candle completely engulfs the previous day’s candle, is a strong reversal signal that suggests the upward momentum has exhausted itself. This pattern, combined with the failure to clear the $69,000 zone, indicates that Bitcoin could be facing a deeper correction. RLinda’s goes further to highlight that the recent rally appears to have been a false breakout from the descending resistance trendline that has been in place since Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $73,737. The descending trendline has acted as a ceiling for Bitcoin’s price rallies since March. Although last week’s rally initially seemed to break through it, the subsequent rejection suggests the breakout was not sustainable. Given this, the analyst notes that Bitcoin has now returned to a consolidation phase just below this trendline. As Bitcoin continues to consolidate, it increases the risk of deeper correction. How Far Can A Bitcoin Price Correction Go? Looking ahead, RLinda foresees a potential correction in Bitcoin’s price, with the first target for a decline set around $65,000. Should this level fail to hold, further corrections could see Bitcoin falling to $61,000, $58,000, and possibly as low as $57,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prediction: Crypto Analyst Says Things Are ‘About To Get Interesting’ However, this bearish outlook is not set in stone. RLinda adds that the bearish structure could be invalidated if Bitcoin manages to break above $69,400. A break above would secure the bullish momentum and a sustained breakout above the descending triangle. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,670, marking a 0.6% decline in the last 24 hours. The current price action aligns with RLinda’s prediction of consolidation below the descending resistance trendline. In the meantime, the next few days could determine how much Bitcoin closes October (Uptober) in the green zone. Resistance levels to watch are $66,500 and $65,000, while support levels to watch are $68,400, $69,400, and $71,500.
