42408100,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9j3v,1717457392,Trump Conviction Barely Dents His Odds of Winning Election: Prediction Markets,"This week in prediction markets:  Trump is convicted, but bettors on Polymarket have a conviction he'll stay out of prison and return to the White House.  No rate cut this year, Kalshi traders say  Donald J. Trump is the first U.S. president, former or otherwise, to be convicted in criminal court. But this dubious distinction did little to sway his odds of retaking the White House, prediction markets indicate.  For the uninitiated, on prediction markets, when the trade settles, those who bet on the correct outcome get $1 per contract purchased, and those who bought ""shares"" in the incorrect one get zero. The contract's value can be read like a poll; a contract with a value of 40 cents could be read as a 40% chance of the prediction coming true.  On crypto-based Polymarket, where the election contract is nearing $150 million in total bets, Trump's guilty verdict didn't do much to move prices, knocking just a penny off the ""yes"" contract's value.  Week-over-week, the probability of Trump winning is down around two percentage points, to 54%. But on May 31, the day a jury convicted Trump of felony crimes, it lost only one percentage point.  Trump's 16-point lead over President Joe Biden on Polymarket is still much more pronounced than the polling averages. By that traditional measure, the presumptive GOP nominee is still ahead of the incumbent, but by less than a percentage point according to an aggregate produced by 270 to Win.  On PredictIt, a more mainstream betting site where trades are placed in dollars rather than stablecoins, the Trump contract actually gained 1 cent following the guilty verdict, although at 51-48 his lead over Biden is narrower and closer to the polls than on Polymarket. Unlike Polymarket, which blocks U.S. users under a regulatory settlement but has traders around the world, PredictIt is open only to Americans.  Legal experts have said that Trump is unlikely to face a prison sentence for his crime, and the market is in line with this sentiment.  On a Polymarket contract asking if Trump will go to prison, bettors are fairly confident he won't see the inside of a cell, giving a 76% probability he will serve no time; a 18% change he will get less than a year; and a 2% change he will get one to two years.  Polymarket bettors were fairly accurate when predicting the sentence for former Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao.  CZ was sentenced (and is now serving) a four-month prison sentence. Before sentencing, the market was confident that he'd get less than a year, and more specifically, less than six months. The Department of Justice had asked for a three-year sentence, while CZ's attorneys had argued for 18 months in his plea agreement.  Rate cut wen?  Kalshi and Polymarket traders are not pricing in a rate cut, creating a stark contrast with the CME FedWatch poll, which does anticipate a cut by the fall, and gives some certainty of another by the winter.  On Kalshi, the only U.S.-regulated platform for these contracts, bettors are giving a 32% chance of zero cuts, while they are pricing in a 29% chance of one cut. ""Two cuts"" is coming in next at 24%.  Over at Polymarket, bettors are split between zero and two cuts, giving a 30% chance of each happening.  Economists are split on whether the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in 2024.  Factors such as elevated inflation, a resilient economy, and a labor market that remains strong, though slightly softening, suggest that easing monetary policy may not be necessary. However, the persistence of these conditions throughout the year adds an element of doubt.  Some, like Steve Englander from Standard Chartered Bank, argue there's a chance for a July cut, citing potential slowdowns in core inflation and seasonal factors affecting current inflation readings.  The CME's FedWatch, a poll of market participants, paints a different picture.  It's targeting a 54% chance of the first rate cut occurring by the Sept. 18 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, and growing confidence that a second – or even third – cut will occur by December.  This divergence will be something to watch, to see if the market participants on CME's FedWatch know more than the market observers on prediction markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | BNB,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/06/03/trump-conviction-barely-dents-his-odds-of-winning-election-prediction-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38021df48e54bd252e5066b8d1d9e9c48bdfb834-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A Large Amount Of Investors Bought Their Bitcoin Between $66,900 & $68,900 According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, BTC is currently floating above a major demand zone. In on-chain analysis, the strength of any support or resistance level is based on how much “demand” was present at it. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Realized Volatility’ Showing Very Rare Trend: What Could Be Next Below is a chart that shows the various Bitcoin price ranges near the current spot value and how they compare in terms of the total amount of the asset the investors purchased. Here, the size of the dot correlates to the total number of tokens that were last acquired at the corresponding price range. It would appear that, out of these zones, the levels between $66,900 and $68,900 currently host the cost basis of the greatest amount of BTC. More than two million addresses have acquired 1.1 million BTC inside this range. Since the current BTC spot price is above these levels, all investors who buy there will make slight profits. Investor cost basis is important in the on-chain analysis because the level has special psychological significance. A potential retest of it can result in a flip of the profit-loss balance for the holder. As such, investors may be prone to making some moves when a retest like this takes place. A holder carrying losses before the retest (that is, the retest is happening from below) may be tempted to sell for fear that the price will go down in the future. On the other hand, an investor in the green before the retest may have reason to believe the price would go up again and, thus, could decide to accumulate more. When retests of price ranges thick with investors, one of these reactions may arise on a scale that could be relevant for the wider market, therefore, major demand zones below can act as support points, while those above can act as resistance blocks. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Will Rise To $79,600 If This Holds Bitcoin has a large support range of $66,900 to $68,900 right now, which could help cushion any falls should the asset’s price decrease. From the chart, it’s also apparent that, at the same time, the Bitcoin ranges ahead are thin with holders. This could, in theory, provide the ideal conditions for a rally towards higher levels.

This pattern, characterized by two converging trend lines, represents a period of consolidation before the price potentially moves in a more decisive direction. Ali suggests that if Bitcoin can sustain a close above the $69,330 resistance level, it may quickly ascend to around $74,400. This move would break the recent static trend and signal the beginning of a more substantial rally. #Bitcoin appears to be breaking out from a symmetrical triangle!

His observations are backed by historical data and technical indicators that align with Bitcoin’s current market activity. According to TechDev, Bitcoin is exhibiting a pattern that could indicate a major bullish phase. He notes that historically, Bitcoin has experienced significant price increases, known as “blowoff tops,” which have typically been followed by notable corrections. However, the current scenario is different. Bitcoin did not experience a blowoff top in 2021, which diverges from its historical behavior and suggests a potential buildup to a more sustained price increase.

The largest crypto by market capitalization recently changed hands at around $69,200, up 2% over the past 24 hours, while Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} was little changed slightly below $3,800. The broad-market CoinDesk 20 Index gained 1.6% over the past 24 hours.  Bitcoin and the broader crypto market have spent more than two months consolidating since March, when BTC hit a record price above $73,000.  ""This correction phase now appears to be nearing an end,"" Bitfinex analysts said in a Monday market update.  According to the report, selling by long-term holders was a key reason for bitcoin's correction from all-time highs, but blockchain data suggests that these holders have started to re-accumulate BTC for the first time since December 2023.  The number of new bitcoin and ether accumulation addresses has also been growing over the past month, a sign of increasing bullish sentiment despite the price stability, Bitfinex analysts added, citing CryptoQuant data.  Crypto analytics firm Swissblock noted that the $70,000 and $73,000 levels pose significant resistance capping BTC's price. ""Short-term pullbacks are being treated as buying opportunities, with the $67,000 level proving to be a reliable support,"" Swissblock said in a report.

Crypto Expert Peter Brandt Predicts The Top,"Despite the Bitcoin decline below the $70,000 price mark, a crypto analyst still maintains an optimistic outlook for the pioneer cryptocurrency, predicting that the price of Bitcoin could reach its top soon. Analyst Says Bitcoin’s Top Is $150,000 On June 2, crypto analyst, Peter Brandt released a blog post predicting Bitcoin’s top in the current bull cycle. According to Brandt, the price of Bitcoin is expected to witness an exponential surge between the range of $130,000 to $150,000. Related Reading: Solana-Based Dogwifhat Reaches Critical Level That Could Lead To Catastrophic Crash Brandt foresees Bitcoin’s peak to occur in 2025 between late August and early September. The analyst has based his predictions on the cryptocurrency’s previous halving dates, highlighting that this cyclical event tends to continually present an “almost perfect symmetry within past bull market cycles.” The Bitcoin halving is a four-year cycle event which cuts mining rewards by half, thereby reducing supply and potentially driving up the price due to increased scarcity and heightened demand for the cryptocurrency. Brandt has suggested a possible correlation between Bitcoin’s bull runs in the past with the onset of its halving cycle, emphasizing that following each halving year, Bitcoin has witnessed a surge to new all-time highs. More specifically, he pointed out that the number of weeks from Bitcoin’s market bottom to the halving dates was nearly the same duration as the halving dates to the next bull market peak. In his blog post, Brandt shared a price chart depicting Bitcoin’s price movements from 2010 to 2025, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s past performances after the halving events. The crypto analyst emphasized that after the halving event in 2012, and 2016, Bitcoin witnessed a significant bull run which pushed its price to new all-time highs. The most notable bull cycle was seen in 2021 which came after the May 2020 halving event, with Bitcoin’s price surging to a previous all-time high of around $69,044. Based on this recurring pattern, Brandt’s optimistic prediction sees Bitcoin potentially reaching as high as $150,000 in the next bull market. 25% Probability That Bitcoin Has Topped For This Cycle While expressing his bullish outlook for Bitcoin, Brandt also disclosed a more pessimistic assessment of the cryptocurrency’s future price. The analyst has placed a 25% probability that Bitcoin has topped this bull market cycle. Related Reading: Expert Charts 1,400% Course To $7.5 For XRP Price As RSI Falls To All-Time Low This assessment is based on Bitcoin’s massive rally earlier this year, spurred on by the approval and launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In March 2024, the price of Bitcoin surpassed its previous 2021 high, exceeding $73,000 and officially marking a new all-time high. Following historical trends, Bitcoin typically witnesses a bull rally to new all-time highs after its halving event. However, against the norms, the cryptocurrency experienced a peak above $73,000 before its halving event on April 20. Brandt has disclosed that if Bitcoin fails to reach a new all-time high after its halving event, he expects a price decline towards $55,000. The analyst predicts that a drop below $55,000 will raise the probability of “Exponential Decay,” implying a long-term downward trend for the cryptocurrency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | ICO | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-rise-150-from-here/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The renowned trader has again set the world ablaze after revealing his substantial 5 million GameStop shares holdings. Following his posts, GameStop’s shares soared in the premarket by 90%, and the Solana-based tribute token, GME, skyrocketed by 300%. Related Reading: Crypto Guru Unveils Best Altcoins To Buy Now Roaring Kitty’s Return To Reddit Sets Market On Fire On Sunday night, Keith Gills, known as Roaring Kitty, returned from a two-week hiatus. The trader, known for his role in the GameStop saga, wreaked havoc after posting on Reddit for the first time in three years. Roaring Kitty’s “GME YOLO Update” post unveiled that Gill owns 5 million GameStop shares, worth around $115 million. Additionally, he has $65 million worth of GME option calls with a $21 strike expiring on June 21. The revelation seemingly congested the order flow immediately as the volume of investors trying to buy GME Shares skyrocketed. As one X user informed, orders were being canceled, even “when you put in a high-risk ask.” According to the investment research platform Quiver Quantitative, Roaring Kitty’s net worth could surpass former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s, depending on how GME moves this Monday. Gill’s GME position sat him at a $210 million net worth at the time of the post. Meanwhile, Pelosi’s estimated net worth rounds the $245 million mark, making her the second-richest US politician on Quiver’s list. At the start of Monday, GameStop’s GME price had risen 93% at the premarket open, reaching $45.73. As reported by an X user, based on the premarket price, his position increased by around $300 million. If GME reaches the $70 range, Gill’s position would be worth over $1 billion. Solana-Based GME Jumps 300% Roaring Kitty’s ripple effect also drove attention to the Solana-based memecoin GME. Solana’s GME was launched in February 2024 as a tribute to GameStop’s meme stock event from 2021. During the trader’s first return to the crypto space on May 13, Solana’s GME saw a surge of 3,921%. The token went from trading for $0.0004914 to $0.01976 before retracing to the $0.0035 price range in the following days. As Roaring Kitty went silent, the Solana memecoin hovered between $0.0035-$0.0040. However, Gill’s latest post has fueled market interest in the token by 1,500%, with a daily trading volume of $237 million. Moreover, the token has increased by over 300% since the trader’s posts, going from $0.003907 to $0.01594 as Monday started. Lookonchain reported that a GME whale’s smart trading move was paying off. According to the post, a whale has shown a track record of buying Solana’s GME at low prices and selling it at highs. In February, a trader spent 1,409 Solana (SOL), worth around $165,000, to buy 68 million GME following the token’s first price drop. After Gill’s first comeback, the trader sold $35 million GME for 3,447 SOL, worth around $503,000. Related Reading: Notcoin Unstoppable!

David Krause said that the board has always been innovative and it's no surprise that it's experimenting with bitcoin.  The first quarter addition of two spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to the portfolio of Wisconsin's pension plan was likely just the beginning for that U.S. state’s investments into crypto, said David Krause, a professor of finance at Milwaukee-based Marquette University.  The SWIB purchased shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) valued at $164 million as of March 31, a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed in May.  The news shocked the industry as big institutions, specifically pensions, don’t normally invest in young ETFs like the spot bitcoin ETFs, but the state’s investment board has been ahead of the game before, said Krause in an interview with PBS Wisconsin.  “Wisconsin’s investment board has always been innovative,” he said. “This is a fully funded pension fund so in a way, they have the luxury of being able to invest for the long term. They don’t need to worry as much about liquidity as, say, the pension fund for the state of Illinois, which is only funded at 50% of its level,” he added.  As of the end of 2023, the SWIB managed roughly $156 billion in assets, according to its website, meaning its holdings in the bitcoin ETFs were a negligible roughly 0.1% of its portfolio.  Krause, however, said the investment was just a “toe in the water” and he expects the SWIB to add to that amount and for other pensions to eventually follow suit.  “I think it’s just an entry point. I think they’re testing to see the reaction of the public to whether or not there’s resistance to owning this and they’re using it as a trial run, because it really is not going to impact the portfolio substantially, until you get to maybe a 1% or 2% positioning,” he said.  Nearly 500 institutional investors revealed allocations into the spot bitcoin ETFs in the first three months of the year. The biggest owner as of March 31 was hedge fund Millennium Management, which revealed $2 billion in holdings across a number of the funds, or roughly 3% of its total assets under management.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/06/03/wisconsin-pension-plan-likely-to-invest-much-more-in-bitcoin-etf-says-marquette-professor,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f206cc11fd8a42df1034eec7e54e85ceff3929b0-1197x673.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This means the largest crypto tokens by market cap could be well-primed for significant moves to the upside, with a supply squeeze imminent. Supply Of Bitcoin And Ethereum Drop To New Lows BTC ECHO analyst Leon Waidmann shared Glassnode data, which showed that exchange balances for Bitcoin and Ethereum are at their lowest in years. Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges has dropped to 11.6%, while Ethereum’s supply has dropped to 10.6%. This suggests that crypto whales have been accumulating these crypto tokens and moving them to self-custody. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy $112 Million Worth Of DOGE As Crypto Investors Turn Their Attention To Meme Coins Waidmann highlighted the significance of this development, noting that a supply squeeze was imminent. This supply squeeze could help drive up the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum since most investors look to be accumulating at the moment rather than offloading their holdings. In line with this, the analyst urged his followers to get “ready for the next big move.” Interestingly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez suggested that this move might have begun following the approval of the Spot Ethereum ETFs. He stated in an X (formerly Twitter) post that almost 777,000 ETH ($3 billion) have been withdrawn from crypto exchanges since the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved these funds. Once they finally launch, these Spot Ethereum ETFs are expected to kick the bull run into full gear. As such, it isn’t surprising that these crypto whales are looking to position themselves ahead of this development. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted these funds will likely begin trading by July. However, research firm Kaiko has warned that these funds may not instantly send Ethereum’s price to new all-time highs (ATHs). The second-largest crypto token will likely face significant selling pressure thanks to the potential outflows from Grayscale’s Spot Ethereum ETF. This is based on the $6.5 billion outflows that Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF recorded in its first month of trading, which led to a significant decline in Bitcoin’s price. ETH Could Hit A New All-Time High In Record Time Crypto analyst Michael Nadeau suggested that Ethereum could still hit a new ATH once the Spot Ethereum ETFs begin trading faster than Bitcoin did following the launch of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs. He noted that Ethereum doesn’t have the same amount of “structure selling” that Bitcoin encounters since ETH validators do not have to sell their holdings to offset operating costs, unlike Bitcoin miners. Related Reading: Expert Charts 1,400% Course To $7.5 For XRP Price As RSI Falls To All-Time Low He also highlighted that 38% of Ethereum’s supply is locked on-chain and claimed that “ETH is more reflexive than BTC.” He further explained that this reflexivity is evident in how Ethereum leads in on-chain activity, which leads to more ETH burned. Considering this, Grayscale’s outflows may not impact Ethereum’s price as they did on Bitcoin’s price, which could cause the second-largest crypto token to hit a new ATH in no time.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-ethereum-exchanges/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

The nonprofit cited concerns from a “stakeholder,” thought to have been an equity investor in the organization behind the largest Ethereum-based decentralized exchange.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  ""Over the last week, a stakeholder raised a new issue relating to this work that requires additional diligence on our end to fully vet. Due to the immutable nature and sensitivity of our proposed upgrade, we have made the difficult decision to postpone posting this vote,” the foundation wrote on X (formerly Twitter).  Although the foundation said the decision was “unexpected” and apologized for the situation, this is far from the first delay to a vote on whether to engage the “fee switch” that would direct a modest amount of protocol trading fees to token holders. It is also far from the only time that the interests of token holders have seemingly been at odds with those of other “stakeholders” in Uniswap.  “We will keep the community apprised of any material changes and will update you all once we feel more certain about future timeframes,"" the foundation added.  Uniswap issued the UNI token in the aftermath of “DeFi Summer” in 2020 to stave off what was known as a “vampire attack” by Sushiswap, which launched with the governance token SUSHI and quickly began to attract liquidity. Sushiswap was seen as relatively more community-aligned given that it was managed by a DAO and directed trading fees to token holders.  Version 2 of Uniswap contained code that would enable the 0.3% of trading fees paid to liquidity providers (or those who contribute tokens to be traded on the decentralized exchange) to be split, with 0.25% going to LPs and the remaining .05% to UNI token holders. But the “fee switch” was never activated.  Talks again arose about fee switch activation with the launch of Uniswap V3. GFX Labs, maker of the Oku, a front end interface for Uniswap, proposed a plan that would test out the protocol fee distribution on a few pools on Uniswap V2 that received a lot of attention. But talks ultimately fizzled out, due in part to concerns that activation might drive LPs and liquidity away from the platform, as well as legal fears.  See also: Uniswap's Hayden Adams: From Ethereum Idealist to Business Realist  One of the main worries at the time was that the fee switch could have tax and securities law implications for UniDAO given that it would essentially be paying a type of revenue-based dividend to token holders.  It’s unclear exactly what concerns Uniswap Foundation was responding to when deciding to once again delay the vote. Gabriel Shapiro, a prominent legal expert in crypto, wrote that this is another example of a DeFi protocol treating token holders as “second class” citizens whose desires are subordinated to a smaller group of stakeholders.  Similar arguments were made late last year when Uniswap Labs imposed a 0.15% trading fee on its frontend website and wallet – the first time the development group sought to directly monetize its work. The fee only applied to products maintained by Uniswap Labs, not the exchange protocol itself, but did come after a $165 million raise.  There is no reason to be completely cynical here, and suggest that the hardcoded fee switch to reward UNI token holders will never be implemented. Uniswap Labs and UNI token holders are distinct entities with their own interests; ideally both would be aligned to do what’s best for the protocol itself  But if there is a lesson to be learned across DeFi, it’s that token holders do not always get the final say.",NEGATIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING | UNI,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/06/03/uniswap-vote-delay-shows-defi-stakeholders-arent-all-in-it-together,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b12d9f9081ae995bfb96675399cd32dadc1b4078-6600x3713.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Zhao, a Canadian national, pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) in November. In April, a federal judge sentenced CZ to four months in prison – a much shorter sentence than the three years federal prosecutors requested, but more than other crypto executives like former BitMex CEO Arthur Hayes received for the same crime.  At a net worth of $36.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Zhao is believed to be the richest person to ever go to prison in the U.S.  In addition to his sentence, Zhao was also fined $50 million and agreed to step down as Binance’s CEO. Binance, which pleaded guilty to money laundering and sanctions violations at the same time as Zhao, settled the charges earlier this year with $4.3 billion in fines to various federal regulators and the appointment of an independent compliance monitor.  Lompac II, where Zhao will serve his short sentence as inmate 88087-510, is a low-security prison in Santa Barbara County, on California’s central coast. According to the Bureau of Prisons’ records, there are currently 2,160 inmates at the facility.  The conditions at the prison – where some inmates work on an adjacent farm, growing produce and working with cows and horses – are in stark contrast to the notoriously dangerous facility where former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who got a 25-year prison sentence earlier this year, is currently being held in New York.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/06/03/former-binance-ceo-cz-begins-4-month-prison-sentence-in-california,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a8a16451170f6614e4a2d91ac4247ac2e444a587-2048x1048.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Retail (non-institution) sector has been the crypto driver until now but Google Trends shows waning interest on Main Street. Bear case: crypto is tired, not wired. Bull case: adoption by ‘institutions’ will drive crypto to mighty price peaks. The only call in crypto right now is, ‘is this the top or is there more to go?’ Most people who think it has more to go on this cycle predict $120,000+ for Bitcoin, which is an intuitive level, and of course there remains the $1,000,000-a-Bitcoin believers, and every bullish level in between. A top in crypto right here and now would suggest a return to levels at $30,000 or below. As such, it is a critical call if you are either side of the bull/bear crypto debate. You can vision it like this: ADVFN I admit to favouring another leg, but the market doesn’t care what I think, we should all be left weighing up the pros and cons. What has driven crypto to this point, without doubt, is ‘retail’ interest or rather non-institution interest. One of the big bull cases is that adoption by ‘institutions’ will drive crypto to mighty price peaks. As a side note, ‘institutions’ should not be conflated with shifty enterprises with which crypto is sadly plagued, but as the likes of established regulated entities that were in financial services long before new companies sprung up to feed on the retail crypto denizens who gold rushed into coins and tokens. ‘Institutions’ are pillars of the financial system, not slippery fly-by-night companies, and they offer a channel for crypto expansion. Proper institutions have arrived, and US ETFs are here. ETFs are meant to expand the market dramatically and create the next leg up. It could happen. BUT…. Here is a sobering chart care of Google. Google Trends This is Google Trends clearly showing waning interest on Main Street. The bottom line is ‘institutions’ are only there to ‘serve’ Main Street, and they will only play if there is lots of money in it for them. Crypto exploded because of many factors so here are a few to consider: Novelty: Fad or earth-shattering developments all get a boost from their initial novelty Accessibility: Trading with instant access; no KYC/AML, bank account or personal details needed Fun: A free-for-all is fun until you hurt yourself 10x, 100x, 1000x opportunities to profit Ferocious promotion; illegal for almost any other product or category, let alone a financial service A pantheon of young crypto celebrities - borderline outlaws - spicing up the scene Daily emergence of new stuff out of nowhere promising something revolutionary Crypto’s general sexy financial and political outlaw status Its untraceability Untrammelled outlet for gambling Fashion Ridiculously young people getting a look in Transborder-ism There are more, but the above have one thing is common: they are all less, going or gone. For me, this is the main bear case: crypto is tired not wired. So, what of the bull case; after all, I’m long? Opinions are like belly buttons, everyone’s got one and very few are useful. So let’s follow the old trader advice of ‘trade what you see, not what you think.’ This is what I see: ADVFN Bitcoin is in a range waiting to reprice. It’s not a case of waiting for a price equilibrium, we are there, it’s just a matter of waiting and judging a breakout either way. Ethereum is in the same state, and it has a clear way to judge, at least if we are in a new moon phase. ADVFN It is easy to be a naysayer, but I see strong arguments for another reprice upwards. After that, I have no opinion. I say to anyone who asks will BTC be $1,000,000 a coin, ‘sure no problem, if a pint of beer gets to be $1000.’ Beyond that, I think crypto will pivot after the end of this cycle and will offer a complete new set of opportunities outside of currency. As such, I see this cycle - or perhaps the next - being a sea change, so after the cycle completes that is where I’ll be looking for the next set of profits. Meanwhile, I’m still long which is enough to say I think another leg up is more likely than a fall into a new crypto winter.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697178-whats-next-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28872398.jpeg

Next Bitcoin MVRV Pricing Band Is Currently Valued At $79,600 In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about where BTC’s next destination could be based on an on-chain pricing model. The model uses the popular “Market Value to Realized Value” (MVRV) indicator. This metric tells us how the value that the Bitcoin investors hold right now (that is, the market cap) compares against what they put in (the realized cap). Related Reading: Ethereum Investors Take On Sky-High Leverage: Brace For Volatile Storm? When the value of this indicator is greater than 1, it means that the holders as a whole are carrying a value higher than their initial investment; that is, they are in net profits. On the other hand, the MVRV being less than this threshold implies that the overall market is underwater at the moment. There are a couple of pricing models based on this metric, but in the context of the current discussion, the “MVRV extreme deviation pricing bands” are of interest. This model’s standard deviations around the MVRV mean signify the relevant price levels. Below is a chart that shows how these levels currently look for Bitcoin. As the graph shows, Bitcoin is currently trading above the +0.5σ pricing band. At the price level corresponding to this 0.5σ level ($66,800 right now), BTC’s MVRV value becomes 0.5 standard deviations above its mean value. According to this model, the next level of interest is the +1σ, where the MVRV is 1 standard deviation over its mean. The price level at which the MVRV ratio would satisfy this condition is $79,600. Historically, tops in the cryptocurrency have tended to form when the price breaches past this MVRV pricing band level. From the chart, it’s visible that BTC surpassed this level earlier in the year when it set its new all-time high, which continues to be the peak of the rally so far. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Realized Volatility’ Showing Very Rare Trend: What Could Be Next Ali suggests that if Bitcoin can continue to hold above $66,800 (the +0.5σ pricing band level), the asset will “likely rise to test the 1.0σ pricing band at $79,600.” A potential rally to this level would imply an increase of more than 14% for BTC from its current price. Why do tops tend to be more probable to happen above the +1σ MVRV pricing band? The reason could lie in the fact that when the MVRV attains values this high, the investors are holding considerable profits, so they are more likely to participate in a mass selloff. BTC Price Bitcoin witnessed a retest of the +0.5σ pricing band earlier, but the level has continued to hold so far, as the coin has rebounded to $69,500 since then.

28869344,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611249,1717430448,Is Polkadot Preparing For A 100% Surge And Spike Above $20?,"Polkadot, the interoperable blockchain, remains one of the largest and most popular networks in the top 20. At press time, DOT, the platform’s native currency, is 14th, ahead of Tron and the NEAR Protocol. However, despite recent gains, it is still down 87% from all-time highs, undeniably facing a brutal market correction. Even with this bearish sentiment, a wave of optimism is building around DOT’s future. Taking to X, one analyst thinks not only will the coin shake off weakness but will surge, rallying to over $20 in the coming months. Related Reading: Crypto Guru Unveils Best Altcoins To Buy Now This confidence, the analyst said, will be primarily because of crucial developments in the broader Polkadot ecosystem. Eyes On Polkadot 2.0, Better On-Chain Governance Of the many, the analyst thinks the upcoming Polkadot 2.0 upgrade will be a game-changer. Already, Polkadot is interoperable and scalable. However, once the new upgrade comes into play, the platform’s developers expect the network to be more interoperable, scalable, and with better governance. Specifically, to address scalability, they will eliminate the Parachain slot auction and introduce the concept of coretime. This feature will give developers more flexibility. Instead of bidding and locking resources in the auction, they must purchase block space dynamically as needed. This will improve resource allocation, leading to more accessibility and efficiency. Additionally, Polkadot developers are introducing the OpenGov system for more decentralized governance. The objective here will be to give all DOT holders a voice in decision-making, which is crucial in decentralized networks. JAM Upgrade Proposal Passed, Will DOT Bulls Break $8? The network is also preparing for more changes. The community recently approved the Join-Accumulate Machine (JAM) chain. The proposal, which was unanimously passed by the community, paves the way for developers to build services similar to Ethereum smart contracts directly on the Polkadot Relay Chain. Gavin Wood, the former Ethereum developer who introduced the proposal, said this would make the network more accessible. Related Reading: Notcoin Unstoppable! Token Soars Over 400%, Blazes New All-Time High Beyond network-related upgrades, the analyst also said that more DOT’s are being locked, which is a huge boost. Usually, with staking, coins are taken out of circulation, increasing scarcity. If more activity and the demand for DOT increases, it would positively impact the price, helping lift it from the current ranges. As of June 3, over 1.4 billion DOT were in circulation. By the fourth week of May, over 820 million DOT had been staked. Looking at the price chart, if the coin breaks above $8, the incentive to stake and early rewards plus capital gains will increase.

She also revealed how high the flagship crypto could rise on its next leg up. Furthermore, her analysis suggested that Bitcoin may be about to enter the parabolic phase of this market cycle. “Major Impulse” Move On The Horizon For Bitcoin Tara mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that she believes that Bitcoin is about to make a major impulse move that will send its price to $75,800, representing a new all-time (ATH) for the crypto token. She made this remark while revealing that the “full ABCDE on price and RSI has been completed.” Related Reading: Chainlink Is Not Done: Analyst Predicts 300% Rise Against Bitcoin According to her, Bitcoin just broke out of the resistance on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and has completed the retest of the breakout level at $67,800. This development is significant as it suggests that Bitcoin may soon enter the parabolic phase of this cycle. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital recently claimed that Bitcoin is one breakout away from entering this phase while highlighting the $70,000 range as the level to beat. Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe also highlighted $70,000 as the price level BTC needs to break through to reach a new ATH. Meanwhile, if Bitcoin reaches $75,800 as Tara predicts, that would mean that the flagship crypto has entered the “escape velocity phase,” which could set it up for further moves to the upside. Crypto analyst James Check (also known as Checkmatey) claimed that Bitcoin could attain this escape velocity phase shift at $73,000. Furthermore, BTC hitting this new ATH is also significant as it could cause the flagship crypto to rise as high as $100,000 during this upward trend. Crypto analyst Crypto Jebb mentioned that there is a “great degree of likelihood” that Bitcoin will rally to the $100,000 price mark should it break its current ATH of $73,800. Interestingly, he made this remark while highlighting an inverse heads and shoulders pattern that could send Bitcoin’s price to $75,000. btc Is Headed To $85,000 On The Next Leg Up Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto has also offered a bullish narrative for Bitcoin, stating that a megaphone pattern has formed on BTC’s chart and has a price target of $85,000. He also added that this breakout will happen soon. Before now, the analyst highlighted a broadened wedge that had formed on BTC’s daily chart and remarked that the “breakout is closer than you think.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy $112 Million Worth Of DOGE As Crypto Investors Turn Their Attention To Meme Coins Meanwhile, crypto analyst Ali Martinez also outlined how BTC could rise to $79,600 soon.

28863801,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611204,1717421404,PEPE Shows Persistent Bullish Strength As Market Optimism Grows,"PEPE has been on a remarkable upward trajectory, showcasing significant bullish momentum that has caught the attention of traders and investors alike. This sustained uptrend suggests strong market confidence and growing optimism about the prospects of PEPE. As the cryptocurrency continues to climb, market analysts are closely monitoring key indicators and trends to gauge how long this bullish phase might last and what potential heights PEPE could reach. In this analysis, we will dive into PEPE’s price prospects with the help of some technical indicators. As of the time of writing, PEPE’s price was trading at around $0.00001531 and was up by 3.33% with a market capitalization of over $6.3 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of over $1.5 billion. Its market capitalization and trading volume are down by 3.51% and 26.3% respectively in the last 24 hours. Technical View Of PEPE Price With Indicators From the 4-hour time frame, the price of PEPE is still actively trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), which is a clear indication that it might be poised for a more bullish movement. The 4-hour Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) also signals that PEPE might move bullishly as the MACD histograms show signs of moving above the MACD zero line. In addition, although the MACD line and the MACD signal line are trending below the zero line, the MACD signal line is seen attempting to cross above the MACD line, suggesting that the price of PEPE might still move upward. In the 1-day time frame, it can be observed that PEPE, after making a pullback is showing signs of undergoing a rally as it is dropping a daily bullish candlestick. Although the 1-day MACD is giving a bearish signal as the MACD histograms have dropped below the MACD zero line and both the MACD line and the MACD signal line have crossed while still above the zero line, there is the possibility that the development might turn bullish again based on the price action in the 4-hour timeframe. Future Prospects For The Meme Coin Based on the previous price action of PEPE, it can be observed that a high of $0.00001731 and lows of $0.00001313, $0.00001152, and $0.00000888 have been created which are key points in determining its next destination. If PEPE continues to move upward to the resistance level of $0.0001731 and breaks above it, it therefore means that it will move higher to create a new high. However, if it fails to break above this resistance level, it will begin a downward move toward the $0.00001313 support level. Should the price break below this support level, it might move even further to test the $0.00001152 level and probably other levels on the chart.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin kicked off the week by reclaiming $69,000 as crypto assets ticked up across the board during the European morning. BTC is priced around $69,200 at the time of writing, an increase of about 2.5% in the last 24 hours. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), rose 1.4%. Dogecoin led the gains, trading just under 3% higher, after influential retail investor Keith Gill disclosed a $180 million position in Gamestop, sending GME up around 80% in pre-market trading. Meme stock surges are often seen as a bullish indicator for meme coins such as DOGE. A Solana-based GME meme coin has rocketed over 200% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Australia's first bitcoin ETF will begin trading on the Cboe Australia exchange on Tuesday. Monochrome Asset Management's product (IBTC) will be the only ETF to hold bitcoin directly in the country, the company told CoinDesk. Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia, but they do not hold bitcoin directly. “Before IBTC, Australian investors were only able to invest in ETFs that indirectly hold bitcoin or through offshore bitcoin products, both of which don’t benefit from the investor protection rules under the directly held crypto asset Australian Financial Services Licensing licensing regime,” Monochrome said.  The crypto industry has so far gathered about $161 million after Coinbase became the latest company to donate $25 million to its political action committees for the coming U.S. presidential election, which potentially makes it among the most formidable campaign-finance operations in the country. The money is bolstering the coffers of the industry's Fairshake political action committee (PAC), which has been combing through primaries to find candidates who've left their political platforms open to pro-crypto positions. U.S. regulations represent a massive hurdle for the industry to win more significant global acceptance, which could translate to many more mainstream investors. U.S. lawmakers are showing signs of shifting toward wider acceptance of crypto, which could come to a head in legislation that establishes tailored rules of the road for digital assets.

28860471,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611170,1717416030,Crypto Guru Unveils Best Altcoins To Buy Now,"In a recently published video titled “Best Altcoins To Buy Now,” crypto influencer Lark Davis shared his latest insights on promising altcoins with his 546,000 YouTube subscribers. Known for his candid and straightforward approach, Davis emphasized the speculative nature of his recommendations and the inherent risks of crypto investments. Davis began by acknowledging Bitcoin’s role as the premier digital store of value, noting that while it remains the most secure asset in the crypto space, it is unlikely to deliver the high returns that some altcoins can offer. “If you’re after life-changing gains, then you have to risk life and limb in the altcoin jungle,” Davis remarked, underscoring the potential of altcoins to yield substantial returns, albeit with significant risks. He pointed out that Bitcoin, while being a solid choice for wealth preservation, probably won’t deliver 100x or even 10x returns in the near future. The approval of spot Ethereum ETFs is a significant development that Davis believes will bring attention to other altcoin projects, setting the stage for a broader “altcoin season.” He acknowledged that while memecoins often gain the most attention during these times, other projects with real utility deserve closer scrutiny. Davis expressed his intent to highlight coins with actual use cases, as these have better chances of surviving market cycles and potentially achieving long-term success. Best Altcoins To Buy Now The first altcoin Davis highlighted is Jupiter (JUP), a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator built on the Solana blockchain. Jupiter stands out due to its ability to consistently offer the best token prices by aggregating data from multiple exchanges. Davis emphasized the importance of Jupiter’s user-friendly interface, which simplifies the onboarding process for new users entering the DeFi space. This ease of use, combined with Solana’s recent popularity driven by memecoins, positions Jupiter as a key gateway for traders looking to capitalize on emerging trends. Davis detailed Jupiter’s significant trading volumes, noting that it frequently surpasses Uniswap. In March and April, Jupiter achieved $47 billion and $35 billion in trading volume, respectively. He highlighted Jupiter’s perpetual exchange feature, which offers up to 100x leverage, as a significant attraction for traders seeking substantial gains. Moreover, Jupiter’s staking rewards model incentivizes participation in project governance, providing stakeholders with additional benefits such as incentivized tokens, launchpad fees, and airdrops. Davis mentioned Jupiter’s plans to expand into the forex and stock markets, which could further enhance its utility and market position. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Buy $112 Million Worth Of DOGE As Crypto Investors Turn Their Attention To Meme Coins Next on Davis’s list is Aerodrome (AERO), a DEX operating on Coinbase’s Base ecosystem. Davis underscored the strategic advantage of having Coinbase, with its extensive user base of over 120 million, backing the Base ecosystem. This support, combined with the upcoming introduction of smart wallets to simplify user onboarding, gives Aerodrome a significant edge. Although there is no native token for the Base ecosystem yet, Davis believes Aerodrome’s token could serve as a viable alternative, benefiting from its role as a major DeFi platform within the ecosystem. Davis pointed out Aerodrome’s impressive total value locked (TVL) of around $700 million and a market cap of approximately $500 million. He suggested that as more Coinbase users engage with the Base ecosystem, the Aero token could see substantial appreciation. Davis revealed that he has increased his holdings in Aerodrome, confident that the platform’s growth potential aligns with his investment strategy. Davis also discussed SubSquid (SQD), describing it as the “Google of blockchains.” SubSquid is a comprehensive blockchain indexing solution designed to facilitate quick and cost-effective access to on-chain data. Davis explained that SubSquid acts like a decentralized filing cabinet, organizing data from multiple blockchains to enable developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) without the burden of slow queries. Supporting over 100 networks and utilized by more than 5,000 dApps, SubSquid offers a robust infrastructure for blockchain development. With a total token supply of 1.34 billion and a market cap of around $21 million, SubSquid presents a compelling investment opportunity, according to Davis. He compared SubSquid’s market position to that of The Graph (GRT), which boasts a market cap of $3 billion, suggesting that SubSquid has significant room for growth. Davis mentioned his participation in SubSquid’s private sale and his current holding strategy, watching for the project’s development and market performance. Related Reading: Market Analysis: How Will Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Distribution Affect Crypto Prices? The Oasis Network (ROSE), a layer-1 blockchain focused on privacy and scalability, was another recommendation. Davis highlighted its unique two-layer architecture, which separates consensus and smart contract execution to enhance privacy and scalability. This structure makes Oasis suitable for applications in finance, artificial intelligence (AI), and the metaverse. Davis emphasized the importance of privacy in blockchain applications, especially for attracting institutional users. He likened Oasis’s approach to Polkadot’s independent parachains and Avalanche’s subnet infrastructure. Davis pointed out Oasis’s robust ecosystem fund, supported by prominent investors such as Binance Labs, Pantera Capital, and Jump Capital. The network’s ongoing rebrand aims to emphasize its focus on decentralized AI, aligning with current market narratives. Collaborations with projects like the Ocean Protocol and the involvement of notable figures in AI further bolster Oasis’s credibility and potential. The native token, ROSE, has a market cap of around $600 million and a maximum supply of 10 billion coins. Davis disclosed that he acquired a significant amount of ROSE during the bear market and continues to monitor the project’s progress. Finally, Davis discussed Fantom (FTM), a layer-1 blockchain designed to challenge Ethereum’s dominance. He highlighted the upcoming Sonic upgrade, which will transform Fantom into a new blockchain, replacing the original. This rebrand, accompanied by technical enhancements, could drive significant interest and investment in Fantom. Davis praised Sonic’s impressive transaction speed of 2,000 transactions per second and sub-second finality, noting that these features position Fantom as a strong contender in the blockchain space. Davis revealed that he secured a substantial position in Fantom through an OTC deal and later doubled his holdings by purchasing more on Binance. He emphasized the potential of the Sonic upgrade to attract attention and investment, driven by the involvement of popular developer Andre Cronje. With on-chain statistics improving and renewed interest in the Fantom ecosystem, Davis remains optimistic about its prospects. In closing, Davis reminded viewers of the speculative nature of crypto investments and the importance of conducting thorough research. “Just because I like these coins doesn’t mean they’re guaranteed to succeed,” he cautioned. Davis’s insights reflect the dynamic and high-risk environment of the cryptocurrency market, where informed decision-making is crucial. At press time, JUP traded at $1.0977.

Gill's social media activity has significantly influenced markets, with recent posts leading to rallies in various assets, including cat-themed meme tokens and shares of the videogames retailer.  Speculative frenzy drove prices of some meme tokens and Gamestop (GME) shares higher Monday after influential retail trader Keith Gill, known for the GME short squeeze of 2021, posted on his Reddit account for the first time in three years.  Gill, via his “DeepFu*kingValue” alias, posted his GME options positions on the r/superstonks Reddit forum in early Asian hours, showing bets of over $116 million in shares and $63 million in call options expiring June 21. He has already made a net $6.8 million on the position.  Related stocks and cat-themed meme tokens started to surge as the Reddit post went viral across social media platforms. Cat tokens toshi (TOSHI), mog (MOG), keycat (KEYCAT) and wen (WEN) were up as much as 37% in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, with most of the gains coming after Gill’s post. GME, a Solana meme token spoofing the company's stock ticker, rose over 200%, according to DEXTools data.  GameStop shares added more than 80% and cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC) rose as much as 36% in premarket trading, MarketWatch data show.  This is the second time in under a month that Gill’s social media activity has moved crypto and stock markets. In May, Gill posted on his @TheRoaringKittyX account for the first time since late 2021, sparking rallies across Solana meme tokens.  Gill earned influence and market authority after analyzing GameStop's financials on Reddit stock market forums starting in 2019, which gained traction during the COVID-19 pandemic. This created a viral phenomenon at the time, and was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021, as several small-time traders bandied together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.  Gill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story that has since seeded a cult following.

The company aims to triple its hashrate, increase operating capacity, and improve fleet efficiency by the end of 2024. Bitfarms has drawn the attention of mining giant Riot, which has proposed a takeover bid, but Bitfarms has rejected the initial offer. Beyond the core operational hashrate power and ability to win blocks, every miner strives to maintain its strong points and unique operational strategies to differentiate itself and maintain attractiveness to investors. Miners like Marathon Digital ( MARA ) and Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) hold a significant amount of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) on their balance sheets for portfolio attractiveness and liquidity. Hut 8 ( HUT ) engages in high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure and managed services provisioning as a diversified business strategy. Bitfarms' ( BITF ) big selling points have been its geographical diversification and expansion, and its focus on Bitcoin mining using low-cost and renewable energy. Bitfarms conducts Bitcoin mining operations in Canada, the U.S., and South America (Argentina and Paraguay). Bitfarms can be considered one of the most attractive vertically integrated Bitcoin miners today. Q1 operations highlight (Bitfarms) Bitfarms showed improved revenue and margins in its Q1 2024 result released two weeks ago. Revenue came in at $50 million, a 67% YoY increase and a 9% sequential increase, while adjusted EBITDA increased 50% sequentially. Two main highlights from the earnings report were the company’s total deleveraging of its balance sheet and the healthy liquidity. The company currently has 806 BTC in its portfolio and received a favor in Quebec’s VAT treatment, securing a $23.7 million tax refund; this has boosted Bitfarms' liquidity position. In running a business tied to a volatile asset like Bitcoin, it is important for teams to be able to control as many variables as possible for efficient capital management. I believe that in this run-up to the Bitcoin halving and the ensuing Bitcoin supply reduction, qualitative factors like management proactiveness and miners’ operational efficiency hold equal weight alongside financial metrics. Excerpt from my April Cleanspark article Bitfarms is on a path to expansion, and I believe the timing of this expansion will be favorable for the company and its shareholders. In most of the Bitcoin miner stocks I've covered on Seeking Alpha, I often reiterate how strategic timing of equipment and facility upgrades based on the Bitcoin market cycle is paramount for the optimum success of miners. Beyond a strong financial statement and ample cash or credit facility for expansion, one very important qualitative factor I look for in a Bitcoin mining company is its management’s experience in the Bitcoin mining business. That ability to strategically plan to capitalize on the momentum and market sentiment of Bitcoin only comes with some experience of past market cycles, in my view. So why are we growing so aggressively right now? In 2023, we analyzed over six years of purchase history for every miner, evaluating the following: the price we paid, the time we plugged them in, how much revenue was generated, the cost and profit, what the payback was, and the cost-effectiveness of each purchase. What we found is that the most important factor for determining a good miner investment is timing. As timing ultimately determined costs. Ben Gagnon, Chief mining officer, during the Q1 earnings call Bitfarms’ 2024 expansion goals include tripling the hashrate to 21 exahash by EoY, increasing operating capacity by 83% to 440 MW, and improving fleet efficiency by about 40% to 21 w/Terahash. Efficiency has already improved by about 9% since the start of this year and is currently at ~31 w/Terahash. The company is on track to meet its Q2 guidance of 12 exahash. There is no doubt about the company’s expansion because of its zero debt and $124 million in total liquidity, comprising $66 million in cash and 806 BTC stash (~$58 million). Despite operational efficiency and growth potential, BIFT has seen a ~23% price decline YTD. The internal management conflicts currently going on at Bitfarms might have contributed to a little bearish sentiment for the stock. Bitfarms fired its then-CEO Geoffrey Murphy in March after the CEO filed a $27 million lawsuit claiming damages for breach of contract. The share price fell about 6% following the announcement of the CEO's termination. This latest CEO saga is happening just a little over a year after Bitfarms' former CEO Emiliano Grodzki suddenly resigned in December 2022. These CEO sudden departures are not a good look for the company. Another FUD came with the temporary crypto mining ban proposed in Paraguay, where Bitfarms currently runs and is still expanding its mining operations . The Paraguay mining ban is intended to be temporary and was recently proposed by lawmakers to curb power theft. Just yesterday, Paraguayan authorities seized 2,738 ASIC miners after unmetered power connection was detected. Moving forward, I believe proper regulation will come into play in that region and legit miners like Bitfarms will be better off for it. The Budding Bidding War …the post-halving period presents opportunities for M&As, with miners that face challenges in keeping up with reduced block rewards and increased network difficulty likely to be targeted for acquisition by peers with enough dry powder… Excerpt from my April CleanSpark article The anticipated post-halving takeover bids have begun in the Bitcoin mining sector. Some of the reasons bigger miners acquire other miners could range from the ease of scaling that comes with a takeover, where the acquirer does not have to build from scratch to expand into other regions or to easily plug in other energy sources. In some other scenarios, takeovers are motivated to bail out a struggling miner. Bitfarms looks attractive at the moment (zero debt and ample liquidity) and has drawn the attention of mining giant Riot, with Riot proposing a takeover of Bitfarms at $2.30 per share and at a total equity value of $950 million. Following the announced takeover proposal, Bitfarms in a statemen t released on May 29 termed Riot's proposal as “unsolicited,” saying the proposal significantly undervalues the company - a stance I agree with, and I believe many shareholders agree with this. Moving forward, there are some likely interesting scenarios I foresee in this takeover frenzy. Firstly is Bitfarms' outright rejection of the initial proposed deal - this has already happened. Another scenario is one in which Riot will double down on its offer and come up with a higher equity valuation. If this happens, it’ll still be a win for shareholders, depending on how much Riot will be willing to lay down. Another likely scenario is one in which Riot could choose to pursue a more aggressive strategy and accumulate enough BITF shares (over 50% stake) to become a majority stakeholder in the company in an acquisition by hostile takeover bid. If this scenario plays out, I believe it will be in the favor of current shareholders because Riot would need to offer a high premium price for most BITF shareholders to part with their shares. Such a bid could potentially attract competing bids from other interested parties, further driving up Bitfarms' stock price as a bidding war ensues. Bottom Line I think the stock price is going to be in the $2 - $2.3 price range for a while until this whole frenzy blows over. Either the buyout takes place at the proposed $2.30 share price (very unlikely in my view), or Riot moves to buy over 50% of Bitfarms' shares on the open market - a move which would most likely drive BITF prices higher, or Riot doubles down and comes up with a higher offer. In my view, even if none of these outcomes play out, Bitfarms remains a promising Bitcoin miner going into the imminent Bitcoin bull run, and I believe shareholders will have the utmost value from this stock. Investors need to stay abreast of Bitfarms' new CEO choice. Riot currently holds 9.25% of Bitfarms shares, and Riot seems to be playing chess, not checkers with the Bitfarms acquisition move. This initial offer seems like a deliberate lowballing. The operational and financial advantage of acquiring Bitfarms is obvious, and I won't be surprised if Riot tries to exert some influence on the board in a bid to get the best offer possible. Finally, as Bitfarms' board has rejected Riot’s initial bid, I expect them to put their money where their mouth is and engage in substantial insider buying (not trading) of BITF shares to show their alignment of interest and bolster shareholder confidence.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4697087-bitfarms-bidding-war-brewing?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/28857372.jpeg
28857192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611168,1717411011,"Notcoin Unstoppable! Token Soars Over 400%, Blazes New All-Time High","The cryptocurrency sector is witnessing a new gold rush, and this time, it’s happening on a messaging app. Notcoin (NOT), a Telegram-based token, has exploded in value over the past week, surging 400% and reaching its all-time high of $0.027. This astronomical rise has left analysts scrambling to understand the driving force behind this social media-fueled frenzy. Related Reading: Is This The Ethereum Endgame? Investors Pull $3 Billion From Exchanges From Humble Beginnings To Meteoric Rise Notcoin’s journey began modestly as an in-game currency for a Telegram clicker game launched in late 2023. Players could earn NOT tokens by tapping a virtual gold coin, a simple yet addictive mechanic that attracted a large user base within the popular messaging platform. This initial success paved the way for a wider integration with Telegram in May 2024, allowing users to earn tokens through various “earning missions” and tasks. This play-to-earn model, coupled with the massive user base of Telegram, seems to be the key to Notcoin’s recent surge. The token’s skyrocketing price has also been fueled by a significant jump in daily transaction volume. Notcoin now boasts a daily trade volume exceeding $4.5 billion, placing it among the top four most actively traded cryptocurrencies. This surge in activity indicates a growing interest from investors and potential new users eager to capitalize on the play-to-earn opportunities offered by Notcoin. Whales And FOMO: A Recipe For Volatility? While the Notcoin rally is undeniably impressive, whispers of caution linger within the crypto community. The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, and such rapid price increases often raise concerns about a potential bubble. This is further amplified by reports from on-chain data provider Lookonchain. According to Lookonchain, a large investor (“whale”) profited significantly from the recent price surge. This whale reportedly purchased a substantial amount of wrapped Notcoin (wNOT) before the official listing of NOT. The price of #Notcoin( $NOT) has risen by more than 400% in the past 7 days. We noticed that a whale has an unrealized profit of $862K on $NOT. He spent 50,550 $TON($278K) to buy 46.4B $wNOT before $NOT was listed. 1000 $wNOT can be exchanged for 1 $NOT. On May 21, he… pic.twitter.com/Da29qniVzg — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 3, 2024 Lookonchain highlights that upon listing, the whale converted their entire holding of wNOT into NOT, resulting in an unrealized profit of over $862,000. The whale’s sizable holdings and potential future actions could significantly impact the token’s price stability. Another factor to consider is the fear of missing out (FOMO) currently driving the market. New investors, lured by the prospect of high returns, might be rushing into Notcoin without fully understanding the underlying technology or the risks involved. This could lead to a situation where the price becomes inflated beyond the token’s actual utility, setting the stage for a potential correction in the future.

The ease of access and user-friendly experience offered by Notcoin’s play-to-earn model could be a blueprint for future blockchain integration within social media. However, the platform’s long-term viability hinges on its ability to maintain a healthy user base and demonstrate the real-world value of the NOT token beyond its current gaming and task-based applications.

Monochrome Asset Management applied for approval in April. The swift approval reflects a push by the nation to keep up with global trends around crypto-related ETFs.  Australia-based Monochrome Asset Management’s Monochrome bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) (IBTC) will begin trading on the Cboe Australia exchange on Tuesday, the company told CoinDesk.  The product is the first and only ETF that holds bitcoin directly in Australia, the company said.  “Before IBTC, Australian investors were only able to invest in ETFs that indirectly hold bitcoin or through offshore bitcoin products, both of which don’t benefit from the investor protection rules under the directly held crypto asset Australian Financial Services Licensing (AFSL) licensing regime,” the announcement said.  Australia already has two exchange-traded products providing exposure to spot crypto assets on Cboe Australia but they do not hold bitcoin directly.  The company applied for a spot bitcoin (BTC) ETF in April 2024. Since the U.S. approved spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, regions such as Hong Kong and Australia have signaled an openness to the products. By the end of April, Hong Kong had officially approved the first batch of crypto-related spot ETFs, a first for the city as it aimed to become a leading digital assets hub.  In Australia firms require the approval of the regulator, the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (ASIC), and then the exchange listing the product, in this case Cboe Australia. Monochrome had already won approval from ASIC for this product.  Cboe Australia did not immediately respond to a CoinDesk request for comment.  “This aligns with Monochrome’s investor protection-driven mission to offer secure, compliant, and straightforward pathways to participate in this transformative space,” Jeff Yew, CEO of Monochrome Asset Management.

42408099,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ga9j0c,1717407000,Flood of Cash From Coinbase Gives Crypto One of the Biggest Campaign War Chests,"The crypto industry has so far gathered about $161 million after Coinbase became the latest company to donate $25 million to its political action committees for this election, which potentially makes it among the most formidable campaign-finance operations in the U.S.  That kind of cash could have allowed the PACs to spend well over $300,000 on every seat of Congress up for grabs in November.  The crypto industry has – with the addition of another $25 million from Coinbase Inc. on Monday – amassed one of the largest stockpiles of campaign cash in U.S. politics.  U.S. digital assets exchange Coinbase (COIN) announced that it was following in the footsteps of its two major campaign-finance partners, Ripple and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), in throwing another $25 million each into the pot that has taken in about $161 million to spend on the 2024 U.S. elections. The other two companies announced their new commitments last week.  The money is specifically bolstering the coffers of the industry's Fairshake political action committee (PAC) and its affiliate PACs, which have been combing through state primaries to find congressional candidates who've left their political platforms open to pro-crypto positions. The committees have flooded some little-known politicians with millions in off-book support. So-called super PACs like these typically buy ads for or against candidates, but they aren't allowed to have any official connections with the candidates' campaigns.  ""When it comes to our mission of increasing economic freedom by growing the adoption of cryptocurrencies, we are deeply engaged in policy efforts,"" Coinbase said in a company statement. ""The House and Senate help determine what crypto legislation gets passed, amongst other things, so growing the number of pro-crypto members is critical.""  Read More: Crypto Dollars Helped Lift U.S. Politicians to Victory in Congressional Primaries  U.S. regulations represent the massive remaining hurdle for the industry to win more significant global acceptance, which could translate to many more mainstream investors and users embracing the technology. U.S. lawmakers are showing recent signs of shifting toward wider acceptance of crypto, and the next congressional session could see all that come to a head in legislation that establishes tailored rules of the road for digital assets.  Super PACs allow corporations to plough unlimited cash into steering elections, and the crypto industry’s stockpile of campaign cash now rivals the scale of the massive war chests assembled by the political parties themselves to dole out to House and Senate races. The digital assets businesses are also rivaling the most historically political and deep-pocketed industries.  But the actual management and strategies of Fairshake — including its ongoing level of involvement with the donors backing it — remain opaque, because its main supporters decline to answer management questions and the PAC’s organizers won’t comment on such details.  House Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who has run the House GOP's campaign operations in the past, pushed back on narratives that the PACs suggest crypto is trying to buy Congress.  ""This is no different than the healthcare industry; this is no different than the airline industry,"" he told a crowd at CoinDesk's Consensus 2024 last week in Texas. ""This is all about: I want to get to know you. I'm going to invest in you, because I want to see you being the representative, because your views are in alignment with mine.""  All three companies – Coinbase, Ripple and a16z – may crowd into the top five individual company donors ranked by OpenSecrets.org, if other companies among the biggest political donors don't make similar short-term additions to surpass their spending.  By comparison to the $161 million for crypto causes, the Congressional Leadership Fund – the conservative PAC associated with House Speaker Mike Johnson – had tallied $84 million, and the Senate Leadership Fund – the equivalent for Republican efforts in the Senate – had taken in $64 million, as of the most recent disclosures two months ago. The House Majority PAC, which seeks to put Democrats in the House, announced it intends to spend $186 million on advertising this year, though it's only showing $86 million in contributions so far, according to Federal Election Commission records.  Though Fairshake has already spend tens of millions on targeted races, its fundraising level would have theoretically allowed it to spend well over $300,000 on every contested House and Senate seat – a total of 468 – in the November 5 general election.

Sheinbaum's party has not proposed a comprehensive policy for crypto, but has imposed a 20% tax on crypto gains and reflected a focus on regulating blockchain.  Mexico City’s former mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, was elected president of Mexico to become the first woman to hold that position, according to multiple reports including The New York Times.  The result signals the probable continuation of Mexico's crypto policy because Sheinbaum is from the ruling Morena party. Her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, could not run again under the constitution. Sheinbaum has aligned herself with Obrador's policies, though there was little to no mention of crypto in Mexico's biggest election to date.  The Morena party has not proposed any comprehensive legislation for the crypto sector, though it has imposed a 20% tax on crypto gains. Other policies and regulations require cryptocurrency exchanges to be registered under global requirements for anti-money laundering and terror financing. The party has also reflected a focus on regulating blockchain to make the technology and ecosystem more secure.  It's too early to say whether recent crypto-related developments in the U.S., which happened as Mexico's election campaigns unfolded, will encourage the Morena party to reconsider its keep-it-in-the-shadows stand on crypto policy. Mexico is the largest market for remittances from the U.S., making crypto a potential option for Mexicans.  In the past few weeks, a major crypto bill has cleared one of the chambers of the U.S. Congress for the first time; former President Donald Trump – the presumptive Republican presidential election nominee – not only started accepting donations in crypto, but also said that the U.S. must be the global leader in crypto; and President Biden's re-election campaign has reportedly begun reaching out to crypto industry participants for guidance on crypto community and policy.‘ The Securities and Exchange Commission is also expected to greenlight the launch of spot ether exchange-traded funds.  Sheinbaum has said she's confident of having a good relationship with whoever comes to power in 2024.

28850340,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611151,1717401044,Is This The Biggest Bitcoin Bull Run Ever? Analyst Says Yes!,"Crypto analyst TechDev (@TechDev_52) recently shared a detailed chart analysis suggesting that Bitcoin might be on the cusp of its most significant breakout to date. This analysis, backed by historical patterns and technical indicators, points to a potential shift in the market that could lead to unprecedented price levels for Bitcoin. The chart provided by TechDev illustrates Bitcoin’s price action in USD alongside its price relative to the M1 money supply (BTC/M1). Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited distinct phases of parabolic price increases, known as “blowoff tops,” followed by sharp corrections. These blowoff tops are marked with green check marks on the chart, occurring in 2011, 2013, and 2017. Each of these peaks was followed by significant corrections. Notably, the 2021 peak did not result in a blowoff top, as indicated by the red cross on the chart. This deviation from historical patterns is significant because it suggests a possible change in market behavior. TechDev’s chart also highlights a key pattern known as the “descending right-angled broadening formation.” This technical pattern is characterized by a series of lower highs and lower lows, creating a broadening wedge shape. The pattern typically signals a period of consolidation, where the price oscillates within the broadening trend lines before a decisive breakout. The chart shows that Bitcoin has recently broken out of this broadening wedge, indicating a potential shift from a consolidation phase to a new bullish trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Indicator Flashes Signal Last Seen Before 480% Surge In Mid-2020 The analyst commented, “Significant. Bitcoin has only seen blow-off tops after breakouts against M1 money supply. And the longer it’s consolidated, the longer it’s run. This breakout follows the longest consolidation yet. In fact, it represents a textbook breakout of a 5 year broadening wedge. The last 5 years have been corrective against M1. BTC is once again impulsive against it for the first time since 2017. We’ve never seen a Bitcoin breakout like this one.” Bitcoin Could Outpace The 2021 Cycle Another critical aspect of TechDev’s analysis is the breakout of Bitcoin against the M1 money supply. The M1 money supply includes physical currency and checkable deposits, representing the most liquid forms of money in the economy. TechDev points out that Bitcoin has broken out against M1 for the first time since March 2017. This breakout is particularly significant because it suggests that Bitcoin’s recent price increase is driven by intrinsic demand rather than merely an increase in the money supply. Related Reading: Market Analysis: How Will Mt. Gox’s Bitcoin Distribution Affect Crypto Prices? TechDev comments on this breakout, stating: “You’re looking at the first breakout of Bitcoin against M1 money supply since March 2017 when it went historically parabolic for 9 months. Comparisons and trend projections involving 2021 may end up dramatically underestimating things. One interpretation: In 2021 BTC was carried to new USD highs by increased money supply. In 2024 it’s gotten there on its own demand (and thus broke out against M1). Add the anticipated M1 growth this time and we likely see BTC outpace expectations based in part on 2021.” TechDev’s analysis underscores the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s performance relative to macroeconomic indicators like the M1 money supply. By breaking out against M1, Bitcoin demonstrates strong intrinsic demand, which is a bullish signal for future price movements. The historical patterns of blowoff tops following similar breakouts suggest that Bitcoin could be entering a new phase of price discovery, potentially leading to new all-time highs. At press time, BTC traded at $69,032.

28846188,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=611132,1717394659,Is This The Ethereum Endgame? Investors Pull $3 Billion From Exchanges,"The winds of change are blowing through the Ethereum ecosystem. Since the long-awaited approval of spot Ether ETFs in the US on May 23rd, a quiet exodus of Ether has been underway. A massive amount of the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency, or around $3 billion, has vanished from centralized exchanges, marking the lowest level of Ether reserves in years. This flight of the digital asset has analysts buzzing with the possibility of a supply squeeze, potentially propelling Ether to new heights. Related Reading: Ethereum On Edge: Can Ether Smash Through Resistance Or Stall After Rally? Exodus To Self-Custody: A Bullish Signal? Crypto analyst Ali Martinez reported on X in a recent post that since the US legalized spot Ethereum ETF products, nearly 777,000 ETH, or almost $3 billion, have been removed from cryptocurrency exchanges. Even if the Ether ETF products haven’t formally begun trading on exchanges yet, the continuation of this trend could have a significant impact on how ETH prices behave over time. Since the @SECGov approved spot #Ethereum ETFs, approximately 777,000 $ETH — valued at about $3 billion — have been withdrawn from #crypto exchanges! pic.twitter.com/EzQVC0cw27 — Ali (@ali_charts) June 2, 2024 Traditionally, high reserves on exchanges have indicated a selling-heavy market, with investors readily offloading their holdings. The current situation, however, paints a different picture. Analysts suggest this mass exodus signifies a shift in investor sentiment. Many are moving their Ether to personal wallets, a move known as self-custody, indicating a long-term bullish outlook. The low exchange reserves suggest investors are treating Ether not just as a trading asset, but as a potential store of value, says Michael Nadeau, a DeFi report crypto analyst. This shift in mindset, coupled with the potential for increased demand from ETFs, could create a perfect storm for a price surge. The Ethereum network itself may also be contributing to the supply squeeze. Unlike Bitcoin miners who face constant operational costs, Ethereum validators, responsible for securing the network under the Proof-of-Stake model, don’t have the same financial pressure to sell their holdings. This lack of “structural sell pressure,” as Nadeau terms it, further restricts the readily available supply of Ether. Ethereum ETF Launch: A Double-Edged Sword? The upcoming launch of Ether ETFs in late June adds another layer of intrigue. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January, which saw a significant price increase for Bitcoin, serves as a potential roadmap for Ether. Analysts predict a similar demand surge, pushing the price of Ether towards, or even beyond, its all-time high of $4,871 set in November 2021. However, a potential roadblock exists in the form of Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE), a massive investment vehicle currently holding a staggering $11 billion worth of Ether. If Grayscale decides to follow suit with its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which experienced over $6 billion in outflows after the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, it could dampen the price increase.

While the future remains uncertain, the current market conditions present a fascinating scenario for Ether. The combination of a shrinking supply and the potential influx of demand from ETFs paints a picture of a potential bull run. However, the wildcard of Grayscale’s actions and the broader market sentiment inject a dose of caution.
