Bitcoin Might Be Poised For New Peak This Month Bitcoin is presently exhibiting a downward pressure on low timeframes, falling to the $65,000 price level after briefly touching $71,000 on Monday. Despite the adverse price action, Captain Faibik is confident there will be an uptick in the price of BTC this month. Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Range Breakout Signals Potential Upsurge: Analyst Captain Faibik’s analysis emphasizes Bitcoin’s bullish pennant formation on the 12-hour timeframe chart. According to the crypto expert, an upside breakout is anticipated later this week. Should there be a successful breakout, as anticipated by the expert, Bitcoin might be poised to reach a new all-time high. As a result, Captain Faibik has set his price target around the $88,000 and $90,000 threshold this month. The post read: BTC Bullish pennant formation on the 12hrs timeframe Chart. Expecting an upside Breakout later this Week. In case of a Successful Breakout, Bitcoin might hit $88,000-$90,000 this month. The expert has also confirmed that the bullish pennant developed on the daily timeframe chart. Thus, the analyst is optimistic that the breakout will materialize soon. The analyst has also identified some buying pressure on low timeframes, triggering momentum for the crypto asset. “BTC Bulls are defending the 4-hour Exponential Moving Average (EMA) 200 around $65,600 and bullish pennant also in play,” he stated. However, for the Bitcoin bulls to regain momentum, they must reclaim the critical resistance level of $70,000. This suggests the bulls still have more work to do to reach the resistance level. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $66,125, with a decline of over 5% in the past 7 days. Its trading volume has plummeted by nearly 9% in the past day, while its market cap is slightly up by 0.81%. Possible Correction On The Downtrend While Faibik anticipates a recovery, some analysts are pessimistic about the asset’s movement and express worries about a potential pullback. One of the crypto experts who predicted a further correction in BTC is The Fomo Factory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Washes Out 81,000 Crypto Traders For Over $220 Million The expert discussed possible outcomes and provided several worrying price targets for the coin. According to the analyst, Bitcoin could drop to $60,000, representing strong support, and to the $52,000 and $56,000 Fibonacci retracement line. The analyst further cautions against discounting a more significant retrace to the $48,000 and $42,000 region. This prediction casts a shady ground for the largest cryptocurrency asset as the Bitcoin halving event approaches. However, given the previous impact on the coin’s price, there is hope for a rally in the short term.

Early users were rewarded with 617 million W tokens, and the protocol also released a roadmap outlining its plans. Wormhole Protocol Unveils Roadmap According to the protocol’s roadmap, W aims to become a native multi-chain token, leveraging the advantages of both the Solana and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. Initially launched as a native SPL token on Solana, W will reportedly leverage Solana’s performance, offering increased performance, scalability, low transaction costs, and fast settlement times. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Encourages Investors To Buy The Dip As Bitcoin Price Falls To $64,000 After the Solana debut, W will be extended to all Wormhole-connected EVM chains using Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT). This framework allows W to continuously roll out across Solana, the Ethereum mainnet, and Layer 2 (L2s) without liquidity fragmentation. The open-source NTT framework allows projects to control token behavior on each chain, including token standards, metadata, ownership/upgradability, and custom features. Cross-Chain Governance System Wormhole also introduces a governance system where token holders on any supported chain can create, vote on, and implement governance proposals. This approach allows maximum participation in the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) by providing a frictionless user experience for token holders distributed across multiple chains. As announced, W holders can lock and delegate their tokens on Solana and EVM chains, allowing them to participate in governance decisions. The Wormhole DAO, composed of W token holders, will oversee the Solana, Ethereum mainnet, and EVM L2s governance system. Wormhole, developed by Jump Crypto, a division of Jump Trading Group, has been under development for several years. Despite encountering challenges, including a significant hack in February 2022 resulting in a loss of approximately $320 million, the protocol has continued to evolve. Furthermore, the recent listing of the W token on major exchanges such as Crypto.com and the future support planned by Coinbase on April 4 further validate its progress. W’s Debut On OpenBook The W token debuted on the Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX) OpenBook at $1.66, with a market capitalization of $2.98 billion and a fully diluted value of $16.5 billion. However, the token’s market capitalization and fully diluted value have since fallen to $2.2 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively, according to updated data from CoinGecko. Trading volume for W has remarkably increased, reaching $555,937,593 in the last 24 hours, representing a staggering 25,732,359.60% surge.

He also outlined price targets that the crypto token could hit if this price breakout were to happen successfully. XRP Price Could Rise To As High As $0.78 Egrag mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the next price target for XRP is between $0.702 and $0.786. However, the crypto analyst failed to give a timeline for when this price breakout could happen. He also raised the possibility of a short-term move to the downside but quickly added that it has no impact on XRP’s long-term trajectory. Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? Regarding XRP’s long-term target, the accompanying chart that Egrag shared showed that XRP could still rise to $7.5 at some point. The crypto analyst labeled this price level as a “critical target level,” possibly in relation to higher price targets that Egrag believes XRP can attain before this bull run ends. The crypto analyst has, at different times, predicted that XRP could rise to as high as $27 at the peak of this market cycle. The $27 price prediction no doubt seems ambitious, and XRP holders are more likely to set their focus on Egrag’s more conservative prediction of $5. The crypto analyst recently boldly claimed that XRP is “guaranteed” to see as much as a 1000% gain on its way to a new all-time high of $5.5. Egrag further mentioned that the crypto token will begin to experience its rise to the $5 price range between this month and July. Interestingly, Egrag boldly asserted in January that XRP would reach $5 in the next 90 days, meaning that the crypto token is meant to attain this price level sometime this month. Will April Be Another Unfulfilling Month For XRP Holders? XRP holders will be cautious about getting their hopes high despite Egrag’s bullish predictions, which could be actualized this month. These investors had many expectations for XRP in March, with crypto analysts like Crypto Rover predicting earlier that XRP would experience a “massive breakout” last month. Related Reading: Buying Opportunity: Crypto Institutional Investors Pump $862 Million Into The Market However, that did not happen, as XRP maintained a relatively tepid price action even when the broader crypto market enjoyed significant gains at different points in March. XRP’s underperformance last month further underlined its rather unimpressive price action since the beginning of the year, with a year-to-date (YTD) price loss of over 4%. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.58, down in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42408566,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKds6,1712174413,Choppy Bitcoin Price Action Continues Ahead of Friday's Jobs Report,"The price of bitcoin {{BTC}} remained below $66,000 late in the day during U.S. trading hours Wednesday after a couple of modest rallies were met with quick selling action.  At $65,800 at press time, bitcoin was flat over the past 24 hours. Dragged down by 10% declines in bitcoin cash {{BCH}} and litecoin {{LTC}} the broader CoinDesk 20 Index is lower by 0.7%.  Bitcoin managed two rallies to around the $66,500 level on Wednesday, one move coming a softer than expected report on March growth in the U.S. service industry and another coming after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he continued to expect rate cuts this year despite continued perkiness in both inflation and the economy.  Most of bitcoin's rally in 2024 roughly came from mid-February to mid-March. It was during this time that the spot ETFs were regularly adding 5,000-13,000 bitcoin each day, even with sizable selling by Grayscale's GBTC. The action since, however, has seen big sales of bitcoin continuing at GBTC, while purchases into the other ETFs have slowed. On many days, net flows into the spot ETF group as a whole have turned negative.  Alongside, the price of bitcoin has dipped about 10% from a record of nearly $73,500 hit on March 12.  Macro factors figure in  In addition to the spot ETFs, another hoped-for catalyst this year was to be easier monetary policy from the Fed. Economic indicators, though, have crumpled much of that case.  Inflation, which had been receding steadily for all of 2023, has actually turned higher in the first months of 2024. At 3.2% year-over-year in February, it remains well above the Fed's 2% target. Alongside, the economy appears to be continuing to steadily grow, with job additions of more than 200,000 each month so far this year and the unemployment rate remaining close to historic lows, according to government statistics.  Earlier Wednesday, ADP reported private payroll growth of 184,000 during March, topping February's 155,000 and expectations for 148,000. The main event on jobs will be Friday morning's Nonfarm Payrolls report from the government, with economists expecting 200,000 additions.  The strong data of late has sent the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield to its 2024 high 4.43% and the U.S. dollar to its strongest level since last November – both of which could tend to put a damper on risk asset prices, bitcoin included.

42408558,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKdUx,1712173963,"For Crypto, the Global Regulatory 'Olympics' Has Already Begun","This summer, athletes from around the world will meet in Paris for the Olympic Games. One competition is the pentathlon, in which athletes compete in four distinct contests: swimming, fencing, riding and running and shooting. It’s a test of strength, agility and speed.  Matthew Homer is a VC investor and adviser to founders in the crypto space. He was formerly the first-ever executive deputy superintendent for research and innovation at the New York State Department of Financial Services.  Among financial jurisdictions there’s a similar sort of multidisciplinary competition already underway. In this race, however, jurisdictions are competing for the prize of becoming capital to the next generation of financial services: tokenized finance operating in open and decentralized systems. Like the pentathlon, the winners will demonstrate an ideal blend of strength, agility and speed.  Contestants include established financial hubs like London, New York and Hong Kong, which dominated the pre-digital era. But hungry challengers — E.U. member states, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Singapore, Bermuda and California — are also in the race.  It’s a remarkable shift from 18 months ago when some doubted crypto’s future. With Team USA (largely) boycotting this financial olympiad, a fresh set of champions has a rare chance to emerge.  See also: Coinbase Could Move Away From U.S. if No Regulatory Clarity  In this competition, there are four distinct contests: regulatory effectiveness, founder depth, market size and capital market strength. As a former crypto regulator responsible for enhancing New York’s regulatory system and now a venture capital investor, I understand how difficult it is to win in all four of these categories, especially those outside of your direct control.  Here’s what to look for in each contest and how participants are currently performing.  Regulatory effectiveness  Regulatory effectiveness is evaluated based on two key factors: credibility (being tough but fair) and accessibility (clear and navigable for both existing players and newcomers). Striking the right balance between these aspects is challenging. If regulations are unworkable to comply with, markets find ways to circumvent them.  Conversely, if entry is too easy, it leads to a low-quality ecosystem. An effective regulator sets high standards but collaborates with regulated entities to help them meet those standards. Transparency and accountability are crucial.  Two regulators leading the way in this area are Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA) and the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). VARA, in its two-year existence, has already granted 17 licenses and taken at least a similar number of enforcement actions — a remarkable achievement for a new entity.  Pool of founders  The second contest evaluates a jurisdiction’s ability to cultivate or attract a robust pool of high-quality founders. Unlike regulatory effectiveness, which can be swiftly influenced by government actions, becoming a magnet for founder talent occurs over generations and involves factors beyond direct government control.  The factors that contribute to founder talent have been extensively studied and include existing entrepreneurial networks, cultural practices, quality of life and access to customers, partners and resources.  While California, New York and London maintain clear leadership in these rankings, places like Dubai and Singapore are emerging as clear scale-up destinations. These cities attract more mature companies and founders who may have started elsewhere but find these locations better suited for the growth phase for their companies. As these companies relocate, they will eventually foster a new generation of early-stage founders within those regions as their employees and networks go on to establish their own ventures.  Market size  Market size is the third contest in this competition. Even if your regulatory environment is flawless, it won’t attract future financial giants unless there’s a substantial customer base to serve your jurisdiction. Large markets, such as the U.S. (with a population of over 335 million) and the E.U. (with over 445 million people), have an advantage.  See also: Crypto Hubs 2023: Where to Live Freely and Work Smart  However, smaller jurisdictions can still be competitive, especially for companies serving institutional clients or retail customers in other countries where permitted.  Capital market strength  The final category is capital market strength. Startups and scaleups both need investment to grow. Capital chases opportunities in locations with effective regulation, strong founders and large markets. However, other factors also play a crucial role, such as the physical proximity of founders to funding sources, investor-friendly legal frameworks and favorable exit conditions (such as robust M&A and IPO opportunities).  Research conducted by Galaxy reveals that although U.S.-based companies still receive the majority of venture capital in the blockchain sector (both in terms of deal count and capital share), their share has significantly declined. If we consider macro rankings of capital availability as an indicator of where capital may be shifting, then the UAE, Qatar, China and Singapore are noteworthy contenders to watch.  Unlike the Olympic pentathlon, this competition won’t necessarily have a single “winner” right away, or possibly ever. Instead, winners are likely to emerge in various categories. For instance, Bermuda could become the leading hub for stablecoin issuance while Dubai might excel in offshore institutional trading.  There will be regional capitals too. What matters is that the financial services map could be redrawn in a way that looks markedly different from today. The United States is likely to rejoin the race eventually, making this a time bound opportunity for new jurisdictions to establish and solidify their leadership positions before it’s too late.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Matthew Homer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/03/for-crypto-the-global-regulatory-olympics-has-already-begun,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/409437dae2710cc3aa82a3cdd84aee8978bc50a0-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Now Points At Just ‘Greed’ The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the general sentiment among investors in the Bitcoin and broader cryptocurrency sector. This metric uses a numeric scale from zero to hundred to represent the sentiment. To calculate the score, the index considers the data of five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Hits 10% After Crash: What Happened Last Time All values of the indicator above the 53 mark suggest the presence of greed among the investors, while below the 47 level implies a fearful market. The region between these two corresponds to the neutral sentiment. Here is how the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index looks: The value of the index appears to be 71 at the moment | Source: Alternative As is visible above, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index currently has a value of 71, implying that the investors share a majority sentiment of greed. Just yesterday, the index’s value had been notably higher than this, implying that there has been a bit of a cooldown of sentiment in the past 24 hours. Below is a chart that shows the trend in the index over the past year. The value of the indicator seems to have registered a plunge recently | Source: Alternative Besides the three core sentiments, there are also two “extreme” sentiments: extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs at values above 75, while the latter occurs under 25. The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index was 79 yesterday, implying that the market had been extremely greedy. The indicator has been regularly inside this zone for the past month, so the current normal greed values go against the trend. The sentiment among investors has naturally been so high recently because the BTC price has gone through a sharp rally in this period and has explored fresh all-time highs (ATHs). The Bitcoin price has historically tended to go against the majority’s expectations. And the stronger this expectation has been, the more likely such a contrary move will occur. Due to this reason, the extreme sentiments have been where reversals in the asset have been the most probable to take place in the past. For instance, the current ATH of the asset formed when the index was at a value of 88. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Spread “Buy The Dip” As BTC Plunges Below $66,000 With the recent price drawdown, sentiment has also taken a hit. The fact that it has fallen out of the extreme greed zone, though, may be conducive to a bottom forming. The earlier bottom, around 20 March, also formed when the index exited the zone. The current level of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is not only lower than it was then but also the lowest since 11 February, when the asset was still trading around $48,000. BTC Price Bitcoin is now down to the $65,800 level after facing a drawdown of more than 7% over the last few days.

Network news  SYNTHESIZING DOLLARS: Back in February, The Protocol wrote about the perceived risks around the crypto project Ethena, with its new USDe token – termed a ""synthetic dollar"" with eye-catching yields (currently 35%) from funding perpetual futures positions on derivatives exchanges. There are plenty of believers in the project, apparently, or at least plenty of speculators. On Tuesday, Ethena airdropped some 750 million ENA tokens, or roughly 5% of the overall supply – for a first-day circulating market capitalization of about $1.2 billion. (The fully diluted valuation, based on the overall supply, works out to about $12 billion.) The success of the airdrop might reflect the current appetite for risk-taking among crypto traders, and the unbowed willingness of crypto structured-finance alchemists to test the waters for products with ever-increasing complexity. Earlier this week, a separate project, the derivatives protocol Cega, unveiled ""Gold Rush, a basket options strategy involving the Ethereum blockchain's ether (ETH) token and Tether's gold-backed XAUT tokens as underlying assets, alongside a safety component that protects users' capital from a 30% drop in the assets' prices,"" as reported by CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole. ""The product offers an annualized percentage yield of up to 83% to investors who stake ETH, Lido's staked ether (stETH), wrapped bitcoin (wBTC), or stablecoin USDC in the option strategy vault, Cega said. The yield is paid out in the form of the coins staked, so ETH stakers receive ETH in yield, providing an asymmetric upside in a bullish market."" The hope, of course, is to avoid any asymmetric downside.  BLOBS, BLOBS, BLOBS. The Ethereum blockchain just a couple weeks ago completed its landmark Dencun upgrade, including the highly anticipated EIP-4844 proposal that created a dedicated space for storing data – known as ""blobs,"" under a plan to reduce fees while also relieving congestion. But it didn't take long for a new project to come along and jam up the so-called blob space, sending fees soaring and providing the nascent blob market with its first big stress test. As reported last week by our Margaux Nijkerk, Ethereum gas fees for blobs spiked ""after a project called Ethscriptions created a new way of inscribing data, or minting inscriptions, on the data blobs, called 'blobscriptions.'"" In a blog post on Thursday, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin acknowledged that the Blobscriptions episode had pushed the new blob-fee market into ""price discovery mode,"" but he added that the data fees still remained far cheaper than they would have been under the old system of parking data as ""calldata"" in a regular Ethereum transaction.  Speaking of Buterin, he also riffed on meme coins. ""One answer to this conundrum is to shake our heads and virtue-signal about how much we are utterly abhorred by and stand against this stupidity. And to some extent, this is the correct thing to do,"" he wrote. ""But at the same time, we can also ask another question: If people value having fun, and financialized games seem to at least sometimes provide that, then could there be a more positive-sum version of this whole concept?"" Spoiler alert: His answer was not yes/no. (Fwiw go here for our own riff last week on the meme coin frenzy on Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 chain, Base.)  ALSO:  Wormhole, the blockchain bridge project, airdropped its W token on the Solana blockchain, with plans eventually to expand to Ethereum and layer-2 networks via its ""Wormhole Native Token Transfers,"" or NTTs. As reported by our Oliver Knight: ""Holders will be able to delegate W tokens to take part in governance votes. Delegation can take place on Solana or any of the compatible Ethereum-based chains in a process that is being dubbed the 'first ever' mutlichain governance system.""  Roughly $503 million was lost across 233 on-chain security incidents in the first quarter, a 54% increase versus the first quarter of 2023, according to a new report by the blockchain security firm CertiK. Private key compromises were the most costly attack vector.  Protocol Village  Top picks of the past week from our Protocol Village column, highlighting key blockchain tech upgrades and news.  Schematic showing how Celestia's Blobstream works. (Celestia)  1. Celestia, a blockchain data-availability project, said its Blobstream product – for relaying commitments of Celestia's data root using an on-chain light client, has deployed to Arbitrum One. According to the team: ""Developers can soon deploy Orbits with Celestia underneath on Arbitrum One and Base, the first modular DA integration with working Nitro fraud proofs.""  2. Degen, a community token in the Farcaster ecosystem, and Syndicate, a Web3 infrastructure provider, launched Degen Chain, an ultra-low-cost L3 for the $DEGEN community built with Arbitrum Orbit, Base for settlement, and AnyTrust for data availability. According to the team: ""The chain’s native gas token is $DEGEN, making it one of the first community tokens with its own L3.""  3. Picasso Network, a Cosmos-rooted interoperability network, announced an integration between the IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol) and Ethereum, ""enablingseamless asset and data transfers between Ethereum and Cosmos"" for the first time, according to the team: ""Picasso selected Osmosis, the DeFi Hub, to serve as the primary destination for Ethereum assets and liquidity within the Cosmos. This integration is a step forward in bringing 'IBC everywhere,' and serves to connect some of the deepest liquidity reserves and most promising projects in the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems."" The team plans a Solana-IBC connection later this month.  4. Avail, a modular blockchain solution designed to unify Web3 and optimize data availability (DA), has partnered with dWallet Network, ""a pioneering non-collusive, decentralized multi-chain layer, to bring programmable native Bitcoin to rollups in the Avail ecosystem,"" according to the team: ""Leveraging the newly unveiled dWallet primitive, smart contracts using rollups built on Avail DA will be able to programmatically manage native BTC for the first time while preserving user ownership.""  5. PROTOCOL VILLAGE EXCLUSIVE: TheVirtual Society Foundation (VSF) is introducing theSomnia Project, consisting of an L1 and omnichain protocols tailored for the metaverse, ""aiming to unite disparate virtual realms into a cohesive society capable of onboarding millions of users,"" according to the team. ""Developed in collaboration with Improbable, Somnia's blockchain boasts transaction speeds >100K TPS, with sub-second finality, and affordability, addressing the fragmentation plaguing the metaverse landscape and ensuring equitable value distribution among creators. Details of the project were released Wednesday along with alitepaper. The VSF,unveiled last week, was initiated by Improbable, a British metaverse-focused startup thatraised $150 million in 2022 from investors including a16z and SoftBank.  Money Center  Fundraisings  IoTeX Team (IoTeX)  IoTeX, an Ethereum-compatible blockchain optimized for DePIN, announced a $50 million investment from Borderless Capital, Amber Group, Foresight Ventures, FutureMoney Group, SNZ, Metrics Ventures, EV3 and Waterdrip Capital into the IoTeX Ecosystem, ""to meet the growing demand for bridging real-world data with IoT devices to Web3,"" according to the team.  XION, a new ""generalized abstraction"" layer-1 blockchain launched last month by Burnt Banksy, announced a $25 million fundraise ""to ultimately abstract away all crypto complexities, making Web3 accessible to everyone,"" according to the team. Investors included Animoca Brands, Laser Digital (Nomura), Multicoin, Arrington Capital, Draper Dragon, Sfermion and GoldenTree, according to a press release. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Protocol Village covered the XION launch in early March when Burnt Banksy set himself on fire as part of an art-performance-cum-publicity-stunt.)  PROTOCOL VILLAGE EXCLUSIVE: Legitimate, an on-chain project to keep physical assets in sync with their digital counterparts, has closed its $4.3 million seed round, led by Lemniscap, with participation from Draper Associates, Sfermion Factor VC and others. According to the team: ""Legitimate enables projects to embed a wide range of digital content into their physical goods via Legitimate's LGT Tags, which are special encrypted NFC (Near Field Communication) chips that are integrated seamlessly into clients' supply chains and manufacturing processes.  Deals and grants  Origin Protocol announced that its OGN token holders have proposed to merge OGN and OGV tokens, to boost Ethereum liquid staking, according to the team: ""OGN – Origin’s first token, launched back in 2020 – was listed on Coinbase just months later.OGV, which has been appreciating greatly, reflects Origin’s growing revenue and total value locked. The goal of the merger is to capitalize on OGV's undervaluation, as it serves as the value accrual token for Origin's DeFi products, including the successful Origin Ether, which has over $160 million in total value locked. OGN is backed by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen and Y Combinator president Garry Tan.""  Helika, a global infrastructure provider for traditional and Web3 gaming firms like Yuga Labs and Animoca Brands, announced it will launch a $50 million accelerator program funded by Pantera, Spartan Capital, Sfermion and other venture capital firms.  Stellar Development Foundation is launching the Soroban Security Audit Bank, which will distribute up to $1M in security audit credits in coordination with six top-tier audit firms to 20-30 high priority projects (financial protocols that manage on-chain value and that have the potential to be widely used) building on Soroban, their next generation smart contracts platform which just completed mainnet launch.

Solana's SOL was a big winner, gaining 43%:  Bitcoin, the oldest and largest cryptocurrency, rose 14%, extending its winning streak to seven straight months and handily beating the Standard & Poor's 500 Index of U.S. stocks as well as the gold price:  Calendar  April 8-12: Paris Blockchain Week.

42408569,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKe21,1712170843,Digital Asset Platform With Ex-Goldman Partner as Co-Founder Gets Bahrain Crypto License,"ARP Digital received a category-3 license from Bahrain Central Bank.  This marks the only over-the-counter (OTC) service provider with the license in the country that specializes in digital asset structure products.  Structured products have seen a ""huge spike"" in demand from institutional investors after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's approval earlier this year of spot bitcoin ETFs.  Digital asset services firm ARP Digital, which boasts a former Goldman Sachs partner as one of its co-founders, received a license from the Central Bank of Bahrain to operate in the Middle Eastern country, providing services including crypto trading, custody, and portfolio management services to customers.  The firm got the category-3 license over the weekend and is the only over-the-counter (OTC) service provider focused on structured products that Bahrain's Central Bank regulates, ARP Digital said. Structured products, a very popular instrument in the traditional finance world, are usually geared towards investors who need customized investment products and typically include derivatives and other complex financial structures.  The Middle East and North Africa (MENA)-based firm said its products are catered to the sophisticated needs of high-net-worth, accredited, institutional and family office investors globally. ARP Digital will offer services to traditional-finance and crypto-native investors.  ""The firm designs both off-the-shelf and customized investment solutions to ensure it can accommodate a broad range of market views expressed by its clients,"" the company said in a press release. ""Moreover, ARP Digital aims at being inclusive to a wide range of clients by enabling multiple delivery and settlement options such as cash or kind settled OTC products, bankable structured notes, and fund products.""  The management team includes co-founder Yusuf Alireza, who spent 20 years at Goldman Sachs and was the first-ever Arab partner in the Wall Street firm's history, according to his bio on the ARP Digital website. The other co-founders, Abdulla Kanoo and Abdulaziz Kanoo, were former regional directors for Amber Group’s crypto trading firm business in MENA.  The structured products industry in the digital assets market hadn't gained market share like traditional finance. However, there seems to be increasing demand from sophisticated investors for these kinds of financial products, particularly after the approval of spot bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs), ARP Digital's Abdulla Kanoo told CoinDesk.  ""We've definitely seen a huge spike in demand from our distribution after ETF approval,"" Kanoo said. ""We actually see a lot of demand from global firms who want to access it on the institutional side.""  Bahrain has quickly become a crypto hub in the MENA region with its well-regulated ecosystem for both local and foreign digital-asset firms.  ""The region stands to benefit from the growth and adoption of digital assets and has emerged as a global hub,"" Alireza said in an email.  ""There has not been a technological development of this magnitude [digital assets] in the field of Financial Services in the last two decades. The leadership in MENA sees this potential and is positioned to emerge as a global powerhouse,"" he added.

42408557,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKdRe,1712170277,Defending Goldman Sachs’ Latest Crypto Criticism,"The crypto ecosystem is quick to condemn public crypto skepticism from under-informed traditional finance experts who should, we reasonably conclude, know better. We’ve seen this happen over the past few days with the reaction to comments given by Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Asset & Wealth Management, in a recent Wall Street Journal interview.  I’m not going to add to the criticism here, satisfying as that may be. Instead, I’m going to try to defend her statements. To be clear, I deeply disagree with most of them – but I also believe that better understanding opposing views makes us stronger advocates for crypto’s potential. Plus, it brings down the irritation level, which is good for overall well-being. And it’s a fun mental exercise.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Let’s start with the bigger picture and some background.  First, Mossavar-Rahmani has an impressive investment pedigree – including 31 years at Goldman Sachs – that can’t have been easy, and deserves respect.  Second, she does not represent all of Goldman Sachs, which has about 40,000 employees around the world. She is the head of the Asset & Wealth Management Division, which is distinct from Sales & Trading and Investment Banking, both of which are involved in the crypto ecosystem.  Third, some crypto media outlets are shrieking that Goldman Sachs is now “under pressure” or “facing heat” because of Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani’s comments. I very much doubt that Goldman Sachs cares about crypto outrage, and its wealth management clients can find crypto exposure elsewhere, if they want it.  Yet, since her voice does carry weight among investment managers, especially those looking for an excuse to not bother learning about crypto assets, her statements in a Wall Street Journal interview deserve some discussion.  In order of appearance:  1) “We do not think it is an investment asset class”  As I stressed above, by “we” she does not mean Goldman Sachs, just the Asset & Management Division.  An easy reaction here is to scoff at her limited understanding of digital assets, because obviously they are an “investment asset class” in that they trade on active markets, and people invest in them. But it turns out that the official definition of the term can vary. ChatGPT’s definition coincides with many others I looked up:  “A group of financial instruments that have similar financial characteristics, are subject to the same laws and regulations, and are typically traded in the same financial markets.”  It could be that Ms. Mossavar-Rahmani was referring to the lack of regulatory standards around crypto assets, at least in the U.S. If that second prong is indeed part of Goldman Sachs’ definition, then crypto assets do not fit. For now, anyway.  Also, “similar financial characteristics” is a bit of a stretch. Stablecoins are very different from BTC, which, in turn, is very different from AVAX, BONK and a long list of others.  We should bear in mind that she could be speaking about the category characteristics and not about whether or not crypto is investable.  2) “If you cannot assign a value, then how can you be bullish or bearish?”  This one is easy to take strong exception to, because we all know that you don’t have to have specific values in mind to believe something will go up or down. We also all know that you cannot accurately value crypto assets, for too many reasons to go into here. But there is no shortage of bulls and bears. So, obviously and provably false, right?  Hmm. For now, let’s try and put ourselves in Mossavar-Rahmani’s shoes. She runs an investment advisor division, one that is subject to considerable scrutiny and bureaucracy. She didn’t survive over 31 years at a particularly cutthroat organization by taking hard-to-explain risks with other people’s money. Old-school investment advisors need to be able to justify decisions to their clients, they need to “show their work” in case an investment goes badly. If her team can’t assign a model-based value to BTC, they can’t make buy or sell recommendations.  Most of us don’t have Goldman Sachs-level constraints. For me, “up” is good enough, and I have a ballpark number at which I might take some profits, based on “feelz.” Other investment advisors I’ve spoken to have come up with target levels, but they’re not based on any validated method.  I will allow myself the observation that Goldman Sachs has many very smart investment analysts who surely can come up with a justifiable model. Other big-name firms have done so, and even if there is little agreement, what matters is the reasoning. Leaving that task aside, I think we have a right to expect more from a firm that has styled itself as a pillar of Wall Street. That there is no “official” model seems like lazy thinking.  But, Mossavar-Rahmani’s job is to play it safe. In that context, her comment is not out of line.  3) “[Crypto] creates absolutely no value in any shape or form”  Okay, this one is really hard to defend. Crypto assets offer a wide range of services and use cases, which have value. Even if we narrow the discussion to BTC, it clearly has value for those struggling with currency depreciation or limited financial access.  But it turns out that “value” is a very misunderstood word, even among investment professionals. Most of us assume that the concept has to do with utility, appreciation, satisfaction, belonging, and a host of other touchy-feely benefits. Art has “value,” so do flowers and friendships.  But, maybe, Mossavar-Rahmani was referring to the “assigned value” we looked at in the previous section. Maybe she meant that if there is no established model spitting out a number, there is no value?  Nope, I give up. This one is indefensible and demonstrates a lack of understanding which I can only attribute to laziness since no-one is doubting her intelligence – “absolutely” no value?? “In any shape or form”? Sigh. I tried.  4) “The main decisions end up being driven by a few controlling people”  In this one, actually, she’s kinda largely right. I would definitely suggest adding a qualifier – “some of the main decisions end up being,” or “the main decisions on some networks can end up being.” But, on the whole, I agree that “decentralization” is an often misused word.  Then again, “decentralization” is not a binary condition. There are varying degrees. And many networks are gradually working towards greater decentralization, as they promised.  Now we come to what is possibly the most revealing quote from the interview.  5) “At least you can hold onto physical gold and store it; you can’t do that with crypto”  Goldman Sachs has a long history of not recommending gold, and one theory is that it is because the investment banking division can’t make money issuing gold, whereas they do make a lot of money helping firms issue stocks and bonds. I’m not sure I buy that, but it is extraordinary to see a large investment manager ignore such a significant asset.  Perhaps it’s because gold also does not spin off any concrete “value”? Gold doesn’t have any cash flow or dividends. And, if it doesn’t have any concrete value, how can advisors be bearish or bullish, right? And does gold actually “create” value, does it make anything, does it spin off a yield? No.  I think this statement reveals much about the others. It highlights Mossavar-Rahmani’s definition of “value”, as something that needs to be created. It could be that, for her, value requires a concrete output.  It also highlights her limited understanding of how crypto assets work. Many do have concrete output. And pretty much all are possible to hold and store.  I’m tempted to point out this comment also suggests a limited view on gold investment, as few institutional or high-net-worth gold investors actually hold their own bars.  But, stepping back, the point of this exercise was to show that not all crypto critics are wrong about everything, and it’s useful to understand exactly where the barriers to acceptance stand. It’s also useful to acknowledge that conflicting views make a market, and that they don’t actually matter much in the longer term.  Even more important, it’s satisfying to think of all the people we personally know who also rejected crypto concepts at first. Smart, educated people steeped in financial lore, who eventually decided to put in the work to better understand what we see – and they all eventually changed their mind.  Maybe Mossavar-Rahmani will change her mind one day, too. Or maybe not. It doesn’t matter. If our once-skeptical friends can approach our viewpoint with an open mind, then we should try to approach our critics with the same. At the very least, it will help us better understand just where we need to focus our explaining efforts.",NEUTRAL,AVAX | BTC,AVAX | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/03/defending-goldman-sachs-latest-crypto-criticism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3f53dc7f321691b03d286e13163ab80fd53f81b2-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42408570,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKe5K,1712169538,"Cultivating Diversity, Inclusion and Humanity in the Crypto Community","The crypto community is an incredible one – composed of some of the most genius, disruptive, category-creating technologists, innovators, and evangelists in the world. I feel honored to work alongside some of these gifted founders and investors as they work (as we say at CoinFund) to build the new internet. But despite how promising our industry has become, I’m worried.  Margaret Gabriel is Head of People & Talent at CoinFund.  It’s true that women have been woefully underrepresented in traditional finance. According to Vanguard, roughly one in seven investment professionals working on active U.S. equity funds from 2008 to 2021 were women. Among named portfolio managers, only about one in ten were women. Last year, New York Life released a depressing study that showed that 48% of women receiving financial advice felt pushed out or patronized by the very people (mostly men) hired to help them.  Data shows that crypto culture is, from a gender perspective, repeating some of these patterns. The crypto workforce is increasingly homogeneous and male dominated, as is its thought leadership. And so, I’m worried that an industry with so much promise of driving equity and individual freedom might end up excluding and thus failing women. As we plunge forward into another year, buoyed by a bull market, I constantly ask myself: how do we (CoinFund included) make sure the crypto rocketship doesn’t become another boys’ club?M  More than the right thing to do  I want to be clear, 9 out of ten times, exclusion isn’t calculated or intentional. I don’t think that male crypto founders sit in a room, twirling their mustaches while crafting ways to block women from joining their teams, companies, and conversations. The insularity within the crypto community most likely stems from similar origins to that of big tech and traditional finance – less young women study these courses before they even enter the workforce. We become less exposed to crypto and its communities and unintentionally excluded from the conversation as a result. If we’re not already “in the industry,” we become less attractive candidates to the standard crypto founder.  But, homogenous teams aren’t just bad for culture – they're bad for business. Insular teams can unintentionally hinder user adoption. I think about the textbook example of a bunch of right-handed engineers designing the iOS YouTube app that produced upside-down videos for left-handed users. It’s almost a certainty that those developers weren’t diabolically building a product to exclude the left-handed – they just didn’t see the world that way. Similarly, it’s really hard to build a product women will find and use if there are no women on the team building it.  Rethinking how we work  Crypto is built on tenets of equity, decentralization and ownership. It promises to upend how we as humans have traditionally done things – how we’ve banked, exchanged money and information, shared our data, proven our identities. Why not consider disrupting how we’ve traditionally worked? Back-to-office mandates by institutions like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan disregard the diverse needs of individuals, especially those of working mothers and parents.  These types of blanket mandates and centralized approaches are as outdated as money orders and writing a check. It's imperative that companies recognize and address the outsized disadvantages these rules create for working mothers specifically. I’d like to understand how a mother who has to walk away from her screaming toddler at 7 a.m. to get to the office and hit her three days-a-week-in-the-office quota, only to have a full day of Zoom calls (a real story), is a more “productive” employee.  What I love about crypto is that it’s global and the market nevers sleeps – it forces us to realize that old ways of working (come into an office, stay there from nine-five, go home) just doesn’t make sense for our industry. But that doesn’t mean structures that have typically hurt working mothers will vanish with office mandates; I’ve overheard discussions with crypto founders about shortening parental leave to save costs, and a close friend of mine (an operations leader in crypto) was recently laid off during her maternity leave. We can do better for women, and we must do better.  Crypto is the fastest-moving, most quickly evolving industry I have ever worked in. The rate at which new trends peak and fall on crypto twitter and the pressure to stay relevant is borderline overwhelming. One of the downsides of moving at the pace of innovation is the tendency to leave people behind, to join at all costs the “people in the know” and forget that the job of a category creator and a leader is to bring people along with you.  Part of my responsibility at CoinFund is to help our firm and our portfolio companies hire amazing, talented people. In the past year, I’ve noticed a trend that candidates “must know and be obsessed with crypto,” and if they haven’t “fallen down the crypto rabbit hole” (a phrase I’ll happily never hear again if I can help it), they’re just “not a fit.” We must be careful here, as this type of quick sorting will mean many high-potential female candidates, who are not yet in the industry, will continue to be kept out of it.  Fixing the crypto gender gap now  Here’s why gender disparity in crypto at this time, in 2024, really matters. The current reality is that women build significantly less wealth than men on average. An analysis by Vanguard of its retail accounts found women’s account balances held 22% less on average than those of men, despite men and women having the same average length of account ownership (about 13 years).  This disparity widens in investment contribution plans – men were 44% higher. So, despite similar participation rates and length of account ownership, men just simply accumulate more wealth. And this has massive implications for men – think how much greater the financial freedom, the flexibility to explore career paths and entrepreneurship, to invest in, say, digital assets.  Fortune Magazine predicts the global cryptocurrency market will grow to$1.9 trillion by 2028 (daily online transactions in bitcoin are about $6 billion). We have work to do to ensure women participate meaningfully in this investment class, because if they don’t, the gender wealth divide in crypto could compound and compound quickly. We face the potential of women as a whole missing out on material financial gains of an entire investment class (and investing early matters). The research out there varies, but studies point to about 37% of global crypto owners identifying as women (up from 21% in 2021).  Fortune 500 crossed a milestone in 2023, with more than 10% of businesses on the list of America’s largest public companies having a female CEO for the first time in history. And although we must celebrate progress we must also recognize this means 90% of those CEOs were men. Along with this, even fewer women of color lead Fortune 500 companies, with only two black female CEOs among this cohort.  Since stepping into this role, the question I get the most when discussing the topic of gender dynamics in crypto is: “What advice do you have for women who are in the industry or who want to break into it?” My response: “Why aren’t we asking men?”",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Margaret Gabriel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/03/cultivating-diversity-inclusion-and-humanity-in-the-crypto-community,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a3532babc360d45626cd0d03a93308f0f0af1a74-5520x3682.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

PerSecurity Token Market (STM.co) data, lifetime Alternative Trading System (ATS) volumes for tokenized assets reached $110+ million through March 2024. BlackRock’s $100 million BUIDL seed funding makes it the largest asset on Securitize, and Week 1 inflows of roughly $175 million already position BUIDL as the second-largest product in the money market cohort with $275 million in AUM behind Franklin Templeton’s $360+ million money market fund.  While limited to Qualified Purchasers (QPs) in the primary markets (defined as an estimated 2.7 million households with $5 million or more in investable assets or investment managers & corporations with $25 million in investable assets), eventual spillover to a secondary market listing will enable more desirable trading conditions to incentivize investors.

Bitcoin is up ~50% YTD and ~135% over the trailing one-year period.  However, zooming out to observe the transformative nature and relatively small current utilization of blockchain technology (vs. the performance of any single asset built upon it) reveals just how much of crypto’s potential economic impact remains untapped.

Separating Blockchain from Bitcoin  Investors focusing only on Bitcoin’s current price appreciation and its potential economic impact (while substantial) are looking past the fundamental driver of crypto’s value proposition to the broader global economy: blockchain technology. The blockchain’s use cases for powering transactions and broader interactions with information far surpass that of any single asset, with the potential to increase efficiency in a variety of industries. Figure 1 puts in perspective the sheer size of the market opportunity for crypto by pinpointing areas particularly well-suited for blockchain innovation:  Figure 1: A Comparison of Asset Valuations  The industries and assets ripe for blockchain-driven efficiencies represent a staggeringly large and diverse set of fundamental use cases. Let’s dive into a few representative examples:  Financial Services: the value proposition for decentralization in financial services covers asset management, trading, insurance, payments, and more.  Entertainment and Gaming: Decentralizing content distribution, improving royalty payments, and providing secure in-game monetization are just a few of the entertainment- and gaming-related uses of blockchain technology.  Information Technology Infrastructure: Secure, decentralized, and distributed data and computing power offer more efficient and connected infrastructure solutions for technology-enabled businesses.  Fixed Income: Earlier this month, tokenized U.S. Treasuries surpassed the $1B mark, signaling an early milestone for the real world asset (RWA) tokenization movement across asset classes.  Real Estate: Smart contracts fit very cleanly with a variety of real estate use cases, including transfer of ownership, recurring rental payments/yield, and financial derivatives. Smart contracts used in this way could disrupt many industries where intermediary brokers stand between buyers and sellers.  Value Storage and Transferability: The classic Bitcoin value proposition—native crypto characteristics (portability, divisibility, scarcity, etc.) lend themselves well to mirroring gold or fiat currencies as a store of value.  Conclusions for New (and Old) Crypto Investors  Instead of asking themselves, “Did I miss my chance?” potential digital asset investors should ask, “Do I believe in the transformative nature of blockchain technology?” Investing in digital assets should represent a belief in the far-reaching value proposition of blockchain technology, ranging from the variety of industries that comprise the macroeconomy to the transactions that encompass everyday markets and human experience.  A thoughtful multi-asset approach to portfolio construction and ongoing management is crucial to ensuring crypto investors capture the full value proposition of blockchain innovation.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Max Freccia,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/03/are-you-too-late-to-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/94db7f8144138e11fb7ae710b45051c44c473ab2-3575x2011.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Analyst Reveals Why This Is Possible,"A crypto analyst has identified a key technical indicator in the Shiba Inu price chart that suggests that the cryptocurrency is set to witness a major price rally to new highs. Asymmetrical Triangle Signaling SHIB Price Surge Appears A crypto analyst identified as Captain Faibik on X (formerly Twitter) has unveiled a distinctive technical pattern in Shiba Inu’s price chart. Sharing a 6-hour chart of Shiba Inu’s native token, SHIB against Tether (USDT), the analyst revealed an asymmetrical triangle pattern, which indicated that the cryptocurrency may enter a bullish trend during the first two weeks of April. Related Reading: Buying Opportunity: Crypto Institutional Investors Pump $862 Million Into The Market The asymmetrical triangle pattern is a technical indicator which displays a period of consolidation before the price of a cryptocurrency is forced to break out or down. Oftentimes, the triangle patterns are interpreted as bullish, especially if the cryptocurrency is already in an uptrend. This is because the emergence of the technical pattern is a sign that the price of the token will continue moving upwards. Regarding Shiba Inu, Faibik has interpreted the technical pattern as a potential bullish breakout, predicting an upcoming rally that could see the price of Shiba Inu doubling. The price chart has revealed that SHIB’s price could potentially rise between 0.00058 to 0.00062 around the second to third week of April. At the time of writing SHIB is priced at $0.000271, reflecting a 0.45% dip in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency saw a decrease of more than 10%. The emergence of this new technical pattern may offer investors renewed optimism, viewing declines as buying opportunities. Shiba Inu Surpasses Bitcoin In Trading Volume on Indian Exchange Prominent Indian crypto exchange, WizarX recently revealed its top five most traded cryptocurrencies in March 2024, with Shiba Inu dominating the pack as the platform’s most traded cryptocurrency. The doggy-themed meme coin claimed first position, surpassing Bitcoin (BTC), the world’s largest cryptocurrency, which took second place. Related Reading: Tether Buys 8,888 Bitcoin For $618 Million, But Why Is Price Down? Ranking third to fifth place were Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Floki (FLOK), respectively, which are some of the trendiest meme coins in the crypto space currently. Shiba Inu’s accomplishment as the most traded cryptocurrency on this Indian crypto exchange underscores its growing popularity across various global regions. The meme coin recently made headlines for being one of the top most searched cryptocurrencies on Google. Moreover, SHIB has consistently experienced a notable increase in demand and interest from investors and traders alike within the crypto space.

42408559,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaKdYG,1712163883,Must Bitcoin ‘Drop Ideals’ of Decentralization to Achieve Mass Adoption?,"Can crypto scale and still retain its commitment to individuals holding their own keys? Increasingly it seems like the answer is “no.” As blockchain security firm CertiK pointed out in a recent report, nearly half of the $503 million lost in crypto security breaches this past quarter involved private key compromises.  This feature is part of CoinDesk’s “Future of Bitcoin” package and excerpted from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  To be fair, this statistic is likely skewed by a few high profile instances. Namely, the $112.5 million hack of Ripple co-founder and executive chair Chris Larsen’s personal XRP wallets in January.  There were fewer total key compromises (26 incidents) than rug pulls (34 incidents), though if counting phishing scams (83 incidents) — which is definitely a matter of users maintaining control over their coins — key management incidents account for a hefty majority of losses in Q1 2024.  Of course, this is nothing new: people have been losing access to their “wallet.dat files” since the days of yore when Bitcoiners were able to mine BTC on their desktops. One poor soul has for years been fighting for permission to excavate a landfill in the U.K. after mistakenly tossing out a hard drive with 7,500 bitcoins.  People lose access to their keys in attacks like SIM swaps and social engineering exploits; by forgetting their seed or pass phrases; sometimes hardware simply fails, be it hard drives or cold wallets; or things can be wiped in a natural disaster like a fire or flood, and yes, sometimes boating accidents happen.  The point is, key management is an unsolved problem in crypto. This is why, as crypto has scaled to more and more users, there have been more and more custodial solutions that replace the challenges of proper key management — which is dangerous and difficult — with the familiar security solutions of using passwords to log into third party services.  “There’s an overwhelming demand in the Bitcoin community that we must scale, we must scale, we must scale,” Craig Raw, founder of bitcoin desktop wallet Sparrow, said in a panel discussion at Adopting Bitcoin Arnhem 2024.  A video recording of a four minute clip featuring Raw from the event has recently been making the rounds on Crypto Twitter in part because Raw convincingly lays out the tension between getting blockchains — specifically Bitcoin — into the hands of hundreds of millions of users and the challenges of maintaining decentralization.  See also: Are Bitcoin Developers Losing Faith in Lightning? | Opinion  “We have given up a lot of things in Bitcoin because of this demand to scale. And I'm just going to throw it out there that I don't necessarily think scaling is the be all and end all of everything that we should be thinking about,” he said.  Notably, the only way for crypto to remain censorship-resistant is for people to maintain their own keys. There is an old idea in the Bitcoin community that “Uncle Jims” could run nodes for smaller groups of less technically-inclined people, an idea that has been increasingly diminished, Raw said.  “It used to be like no debates around the fact that that's not your keys, not your coins. I'm seeing erosion in that term,” Raw said. “If you ask people today, what ‘Uncle Jim’ means, it's the guy who custodies bitcoin on behalf of the family unit. You see the difference between those two things?""  Gleb Zykov, chief technology officer of a HashEx Blockchain Security, noted in his company’s own report of Q1 hacks that “if anything, every incident shows the continuous and sophisticated nature of threats facing this industry,” suggesting the risks of self-custody will only get harder.  I don’t have all the answers here, whether it’s possible to maintain the precepts of decentralization while also encouraging mass adoption. And neither, apparently, does Raw: “If you start to drop your ideals, you start to lose those things that make bitcoin unique.”  It depends then on what you value.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TECHNOLOGY | XRP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/03/must-bitcoin-drop-ideals-of-decentralization-to-achieve-mass-adoption,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/210eab00d1a8f0a36baf8497fed66fd25505f01b-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25177991,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601225,1712161837,"Bitcoin At Crossroads Ahead Of Halving: Will BTC Fall To $53,600?","Bitcoin prices are volatile, recently dropping from the peak of over $73,000 in March to the current spot levels. Analysts are turning to historical data for insights with mounting selling pressure and some investors being concerned about potential short-term losses. This historical analysis is crucial in determining whether we’ve reached a market top or if this is just a temporary pause before the trend resumes. Will The Depth Of This Correction Depend On This? In a post on X, one analyst said the depth of the current correction will largely depend on whether Bitcoin is “parabolic” or not. Whenever an asset registers “parabolic” prices, it means valuation has increased sharply, and, at some level, analysts think it is unsustainable. In that case, prices tend to cool off later, but after key resistance levels and even all-time highs have been broken. If this is the case, then the current cool-off could suggest the formation of a potential “first cycle top” at the March 2024 all-time high of $73,800. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Outflows Are Ramping Up Again, What Does This Mean For BTC Price? This formation will be similar to those seen in April 2013 and 2021. However, in another scenario, traders should expect a different arrangement, assuming the recent price growth wasn’t unsustainable or parabolic. Assuming this is the case, Bitcoin will likely continue bleeding and revisit established support levels. The analyst predicts a possible correction to as low as the $53,600 support in the coming sessions. This retracement, the analyst continues, will allow the formation of a “smoother curve like 2016 – 2017.” The Influence Of Bitcoin Halving Aside from this assessment, another analyst is roping in the concept of the Bitcoin pre-halving cycle. Usually, and looking at historical formations, prices tend to collapse leading up to the halving event, which is set for the third week of April. In a post on X, the analyst said the current rejection and the failure of bulls to push prices higher suggest that the coin might consolidate between $60,000 and $70,000 in the coming weeks. Bitcoin continues under pressure and will likely register even more losses in the days ahead. Based on the daily chart formation, BTC prices are trending below the middle BB. Notably, it is finding strong rejection from the $71,700 zone. Related Reading: Canine Comeback?

However, a crypto analyst has encouraged the crypto community to buy more Bitcoin at this time, suggesting that the decline presents an opportunity to acquire BTC at a lower price. Bitcoin Decline Signals Prime Buying Opportunity Michael van de Poppe, a popular crypto analyst and enthusiast, has remained optimistic about Bitcoin’s future outlook, urging the broader crypto community to view the cryptocurrency’s recent dip as a buying opportunity. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Major Roadblock As Whales Go On Massive Selling Spree In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, the analyst shared insights on the crypto market, noting the regular occurrence of both bullish and bearish activities, which contribute to the market’s balance and stability. He also revealed that price corrections were normal in the crypto market, independent of market performance or conditions. Poppe has encouraged investors and crypto enthusiasts to buy more Bitcoin now that the price is currently trading at $66,528, according to CoinMarketCap. Over the past week, the cryptocurrency has witnessed significant price declines, plummeting by 4.64%. This unexpected price decline has been attributed to the crackdown on Silk Road Bitcoin, an online black market that allows users to purchase illegal and unethical commodities anonymously using Bitcoin. According to ZachXBT, a crypto community member, the United States government transferred 30,175 BTC worth $2.1 billion of Silk Road hack funds to Coinbase. This massive Bitcoin transaction has possibly led to the cryptocurrency’s present decline, fueled by bearish news and market volatility. “At peak bullish momentum, you’ll see a huge impact of every bearish narrative. This time, it’s the Silk Road Bitcoin being transferred. Anyway, buy the dip,” Poppe stated. BTC’s Peak Anticipated Before Halving Event In another X post, Poppe revealed disheartening news, noting that a critical price zone had been lost for Bitcoin. The crypto analyst asserted that the cryptocurrency would not witness a surge to new all-time highs during this pre-halving phase unless it breaks through resistance levels at $69,000. Related Reading: Solana Whales Are Making Moves – Here’s The Direction They’re Headed In The analyst foresees a period of consolidation for BTC, highlighting that during this time altcoins are expected to gain traction while Bitcoin undergoes a correction phase. He further disclosed that a price correction for Bitcoin indicates a healthy and organic market cycle. Poppe has stated that Bitcoin’s area of interest lies between the range of $56,000 to $60,000. Concluding his post, the analyst further encouraged investors to acquire Bitcoin, emphasizing that “dips are for buying in these markets.” BTC price recovers from dip | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Featured image from CNBC, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/investors-buy-the-dip-bitcoin/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Participants will be able to use the sandbox to test products and services based on distributed ledger technology.  The Bank of England (BoE) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) started a consultation on the draft guidance for their digital securities sandbox, which is designed to allow participants to test distributed ledger technology (DLT) in financial services.  The sandbox – a controlled environment where firms can test their products – is planned to last five years and could lead to a new regulatory regime for securities settlement, the regulators said on Wednesday.  “The Digital Securities Sandbox is an important tool for regulators to learn how we need to react to benefit safely from developments in technology and changes to vital financial market processes such as securities settlement,"" Sasha Mills, the BOE's executive director for financial market infrastructure, said in a statement.  Successful applicants to use the sandbox will be able to provide securities depository and settlement services as well as operate a trading venue under modified regulations. Participants will be able to use DLT in the trading and settlement of digital securities such as shares and bonds.  The U.K. has taken steps in recent months toward becoming a crypto hub, including ushering in legislation to enable crypto to be treated as a regulated financial activity. The U.K. brought in legislation enabling the FCA and the BOE to run the sandbox in December.  The consultation, which runs until May 29, follows an earlier feedback period last year.

A meme coin issued by cryptocurrency wallet Bitget has surged by more than 14,000% to a $31 million market cap hours after being released.  The ticker for the token, which was issued on Base network, is MOEW, and it is currently trading at $0.0028 on the back of $34 million worth of trading volume, CoinMarketCap data shows. 11,700 individual wallets currently hold MOEW, according to Basescan.  ""Just for funsies, nothing too serious. We wanna see what the power of memes can do,"" Bitget's wallet team wrote on social media platform X.  Base is rapidly emerging as a leading venue for meme coin traders as it attempts to steal the thunder from Solana, which has been the primary blockchain for memes so far in this bull market cycle.  The largest meme coin on Base is Brett (BRETT), a token that is based on a character from Matt Furie’s Boy’s club comic. Brett has increased in value by 89% in the past week, while MOEW has already recorded double the volume Brett has racked up in the past 24 hours.  Meme coins are volatile assets by nature as they have no underlying value or utilities. Several meme coins like WIF have achieved a market cap of above $1 billion in the past year, while many others have petered out to zero amid a wave of rug pulls.

In the last 24 hours, a staggering $6 million in XRP contracts were liquidated, according to Coinglass data. This liquidation frenzy can be attributed to the sharp price decline experienced by XRP on April 1st. The new month began with XRP trading around $0.61. However, a domino effect triggered by Bitcoin’s plunge below $67,000 sent shockwaves through the market, dragging down XRP along with other major cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Canine Comeback? KNINE Brushes Off 50% Loss, Gets Listed On Major Exchange Looking deeper into the liquidation data, a clear trend emerges. A whopping $5.6 million of the liquidated contracts were long positions, indicating that traders who bet on XRP’s price increasing were forced out of their positions. Conversely, short positions, which profit from price decreases, saw a significantly smaller liquidation value of $324,200. Market Contrasts: XRP’s Uncertain Path Interestingly, the situation on the spot market, where actual cryptocurrency is bought and sold, presented a contrasting picture. XRP’s trading volume surged by nearly 60% during the same period when these hefty liquidations occurred. While a surge in volume might suggest increased buying activity, a closer look reveals a dominance of selling pressure. The price action suggests that a significant portion of this volume resulted in selling rather than accumulation. XRP price down in the last week. Source: CoinMarketCap This trend of rising volume alongside a falling price indicates that the downward momentum for XRP might persist. If this selling pressure continues unabated, analysts predict a potential drop in XRP’s price towards the $0.55 support level. With these conditions in play, XRP’s future appears uncertain. The token faces the risk of getting caught in a market bloodbath. However, it’s important to acknowledge dissenting viewpoints. Some analysts hold a different perspective and predict a potential short-term upside for XRP, with a price target of $0.74. Bitcoin is now trading at $66.117. Chart: TradingView XRP’s Stable Funding Rate Amidst Bearish Sentiment Meanwhile, amidst the bearish sentiment, a glimmer of optimism emerges from technical analysis. Despite the high liquidation value, XRP’s funding rate has remained stable. In simpler terms, a positive funding rate implies that traders holding long positions (expecting a price increase) are currently paying a premium to those holding short positions (expecting a price decrease). Source: Coinglass This can be interpreted in two ways. It could suggest that some traders still believe in a potential XRP price increase, or it could indicate that short sellers are willing to pay a premium to maintain their bearish positions.

NewsBTC’s analysis indicates that XRP’s Funding Rate currently sits at 0.030, slightly higher than the predicted rate of 0.029. Should the Funding Rate hold positive while the price continues to decline, those holding long positions might not receive the usual funding payments. This scenario could further exacerbate the bearish bias and empower aggressive sellers.

42418488,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThT5x,1712152800,Central Bank Group Starts Tokenization Project to Enhance Monetary System,"Project Agorá will investigate how tokenized commercial bank deposits can be integrated with tokenized wholesale central bank money and seek to build a usable solution.  The project, announced by the Bank for International Settlements, brings together seven central banks from the U.K., Japan, Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, New York and Europe.  A global group of central banks is exploring how tokenization can be used to improve existing financial systems with a new project, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) announced Wednesday.  The BIS represents 63 of the world’s central banks and is running an array of projects on the issuance of national digital currencies and the improvement of market efficiency with technologies that power crypto networks.  Financial service providers around the world have started seriously considering tokenization, which facilitates the digitization of real-world assets. A recent report backed by the U.K. government urged local firms to execute their tokenization strategies. Financial powerhouse HSBC said last month that it was tokenizing gold for investors in Hong Kong.  Meanwhile, the market value of U.S. Treasury notes that were tokenized on public blockchains crossed above $1 billion dollars for the first time in March, according to data from 21.co.  The new Project Agorá – Greek for marketplace – will bring together seven monetary authorities from the U.K., Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Switzerland, New York and Europe, as well as private financial firms to run investigations, according to the announcement.  It ""will investigate how tokenized commercial bank deposits can be seamlessly integrated with tokenized wholesale central bank money in a public-private programmable core financial platform,"" the BIS said in its announcement. ""This could enhance the functioning of the monetary system and provide new solutions using smart contracts and programmability while maintaining its two-tier structure.""  Smart contracts are used in the crypto world to automatically execute transactions.  Project Agorá will explore a more efficient payment infrastructure that could bring together numerous payment systems, Head of the BIS Innovation Hub Cecilia Skingsley said in a press statement.  “We will not just test the technology, we will test it within the specific operational, regulatory and legal conditions of the participating currencies, together with financial companies operating in them,” Skingsley added.  The goal of Project Agora is an ambitious one, said Hyun Song Shin, BIS head of research, during a press briefing on Wednesday.  ""We're aiming for something, which eventually will be very much usable and something which will make a real difference. And the reason why we're optimistic that this is actually something that will be usable is that we're building on exactly the current infrastructure,"" Shin said.  The BIS intends to issue a call to gather expressions of interest from private financial institutions to join Project Agorá.

42418489,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThT6z,1712152633,Far Out Sci-Fi Ideas Inspired by New Ethereum Token Designs,"In the previous bear market cycle, the question in people's minds was “whether blockchain is useful at all”? Then we witnessed the power of Uniswap, along with the flourishing vitality of decentralized finance (DeFi). The question was answered.  Amelie Hua is a freelance writer and independent researcher.  During the current market cycle many are again faced with a similar question. People ask this not out of dissatisfaction, but because it’s not always apparent what crypto is good for.  The answer won't come from new blockchains or scaling layers. It will come from applications, particularly under new standards and protocols than old ones. Given the innovation seen over the past few years, old protocols haven't brought any surprises.  ERC-6551, ERC-5169 and ERC-404 token standards are new protocols that will open up new applications, and new applications may bring users to the blockchain with non-investment and non-financial needs — perhaps providing a more satisfying answer for what crypto is good for.  ERC-6551  ERC-6551 is a token standard introduced on the Ethereum mainnet on May 7, 2023 that assigns Ethereum accounts to non-fungible tokens. These token-bound accounts allow NFTs to own assets and interact with applications. It may not be apparent why this is important, but it offers a vast space for innovation. This article only explores the direction that personally interests me, which I call “non-human account entities.” The three most viable situations are gaming, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital IDs.  See also: What Is ERC-6551? Unpacking The 'Backpack' Wallet  Gaming: The integration of real players and NPCs  “Kenshi” is an open-ended game I enjoy. Players can trade goods between different cities to earn money, but the desert between cities is dangerous. In such situations, players can go to a tavern, hire mercenaries and pay NPCs [non-playable characters] to escort the caravan. In traditional games, these NPCs are not real people, but part of the game itself. Because they are not real people, everything in the game, except the players, has no growth potential. Eventually, the real players will complete all tasks and leave the game.  What if there was a new type of entity or object that could both embody real people and NPCs? When a real person logs in, they enter real player mode, and improve their skills. When a real person logs out, they enter NPC mode (reading fixed data and executing specific programs), passively earning money as an NPC in the real player mode by playing the game on their behalf, such as when hired as a mercenary.  ERC-6551 tokens could serve as the best carrier for this type of entity in gaming. NFTs (game characters) have accounts, data and persistent properties, allowing them to be treated as independent objects. Real player accounts have NFTs, enabling them to take control when they log in.  It doesn’t mean ERC-6551s solve all the problems related to perpetual gaming, but they open up a possible path. As a hardcore gamer, I often ask myself, “Can blockchain make games more fun?” Playing as an NPC is an answer that has not yet been crossed out.  AI: Equality between AI and humans  Depending on whether you see technology as an evolutionary process, you might consider AI as an entity equal to humans — either today or in the future. So, where would AI live? Will they place themselves on a private server controlled by others? How should they manage and use their assets?  The answer might be: A blockchain where digital entities have accounts via ERC-6551 tokens.  Digitization: A digital version of yourself  With data collection and AI training, generating a somewhat similar version of oneself in the digital space is no longer a distant possibility. This digital representation can be trained to act and respond like you online. One day, users may even want to give this digital avatar persistence and perhaps even a physical, robotic body.  Will this digital avatar be considered as an entity equal to humans? Will it mean we can outlast our meatspace bodies? The maintenance of the “life” of this digital avatar is a challenge, especially after the prototype, so to speak, passes away. Entrusting our digital avatars to others, including family, to control is unreliable due to the extended time frames involved. The best strategy is to provide it with sufficient funds to sustain itself.  In this case, it needs a permanent account (an account that cannot be closed) and assets that can be autonomously managed. What solutions can you think of? How can it achieve independence, or in other words, how can the digital avatar have ultimate control over itself?  ERC-6551 is one potential answer. These token accounts are a vessel for independent digital entities, whether that entity is a game character, an independent AI or a person's “digital avatar.”  ERC-5169  ERC-5169 is an Ethereum standard that allows tokens to carry executable scripts. With this token standard, developers can explore applications where some data is processed on-chain and some off-chain. They can explore applications where user rights are safeguarded by a combination of trustlessness and other, off-chain forms of trust. It was an idea first introduced in May 2022.  There is a vast space between data that absolutely needs to be processed by the blockchain and data that doesn't need blockchain processing at all. Applications in this space can have some of their data processed by the blockchain to leverage the benefits of decentralization, while maintaining the possibility of processed other data off-chain to gain advantages in centralized handling. Today, the boundaries of this space are the upper-limits of blockchain capabilities.  See also: After Co-Founding Salesforce’s Web3 Studio, Mathew Sweezey Is Bullish on Smart Tokens  Trustlessness may be the greatest allure of blockchain, but achieving trustlessness is a challenging task. We often deceive ourselves, equating decentralization with trustlessness. In reality, some things require trustlessness, and others require other forms of coming to consensus.  ERC-5169 is token-centric programming, meaning both on-chain and off-chain data — or trustlessness and other forms of trust — are anchored to a particular token. This expands blockchain's interoperability and composability — a revolutionary innovation for the industry that would allow blockchains to integrate with far more areas of the world.  In other words these highly interactive tokens would be able to interact with any number of Web2 and Web3 services — like controlling a smart fridge with a smart contract, perhaps bringing the internet-of-things one step closer to reality.  ERC-404  The experimental ERC-404 Ethereum token developed recently by pseudonymous creators ""ctrl"" and ""Acme"" is meant to blend the characteristics of fungible (ERC-20) and non-fungible tokens (ERC-721).  A good friend of mine convinced me to pay attention to ERC-404 standard with a simple statement: “Trading blind boxes won't last; but trading wine will.” Using ERC-721, the token standard behind many NFTs, can produce products similar to “blind boxes,” in that the total quantity is fixed, and the project team assigns attributes to each product, determining the scarcity of each product by controlling the rarity of the attributes.  See also: Ethereum Has Gatekeepers (for Good Reason)  Instead, using ERC-404 can produce products similar to “wine,” an object beloved across human history because of its actual attributes, scarcity and provenance as well as ability to be shared.  The difference between “wine” and “blind boxes” lies in the fact that wine is produced in a standardized and sustainable manner, and a Lafite Rothschild has value not just because the wine is scarcely produced, but because there’s consensus that it is valuable.  ERC-404 tokens are a product production machine where the input is data (the production materials of making fine wine), such as block height and random numbers, produces an output that is a product that can be sold or used (the wine itself). Think something along the lines of generative art, which is the output of hardcoded algorithms that spin out images that many people value.  With these token designs, we don’t need to intervene in the production process because there is a standardized, automated process. Likewise, we don’t need to define scarcity because the public decides what is rare.  Here's the real implication: Only when a type of product can be produced in a standardized manner can it potentially be widely adopted; and only when scarcity comes from consensus can it be sustainable.  New standards  New standards/protocols bring new forces, and new technologies and scenarios create additional new conditions for unleashing this force.  Taking ERC-6551 as an example, it can be combined with many new technologies, including intent-centric and account abstraction. It can be applied to various new scenarios, such as autonomous worlds and AI.  The applications of ERC-6551 are mostly about creating new demands, while ERC-5169's applications are about providing new solutions to real-world problems and ERC-404 offers a whole new design space.  When we discuss the value of various new standards/protocols, we're essentially talking about the new plays or new projects that will emerge. There's a lot to imagine, and hopefully these new plays or new projects may break the deadlock in blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Amelie Hua,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/03/far-out-sci-fi-ideas-inspired-by-new-ethereum-token-designs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd9a0e578a9da5efeb810bdd2d3debe068d03479-627x352.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418492,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTA5,1712152490,Texas Takedown: Nic Carter and David Hoffman Square Off for Karate Combat at Consensus,"CoinDesk’s Consensus has seen plenty of heated blockchain battles over its ten year history. But 2024’s matchup in the Karate Combat Pit takes the dueling to a new level.  Crypto influencers Nic Carter and David Hoffman are set to go toe-to-toe on May 30 during this year’s conference in Austin, Texas.  “Influencer Fight Club 2” is the part of the increasingly popular Karate Combat series, essentially a no-holds-barred version of UFC without the (time-wasting) on-mat grappling.  Carter, co-founder of data analytics leader Coin Metrics and VC fund Castle Island Ventures, will represent Bitcoin, while Hoffman, the founder of media platform Bankless, will fly the colors for Ethereum. The bout is two rounds of two minutes each, with a third round scheduled if a tiebreaker is needed.  Also on the card is Billy McFarland, the infamous Fyre Festival entrepreneur, who squares off against Alex, better known by his handle @shillin_villain.  “I’m very confident,” said Carter, via X DMs. “I’ve never trained in martial arts before this and I don’t think David has either. But we are both very fitness focused – which makes us a good matchup.”  Both fighters have hired trainers to work on basic fighting skills and they’re preparing hard around other day-to-day commitments.  The friends have a side bet where they’ll donate $10,000 to the winner’s chosen open-source development group. Carter’s choice is the Bitcoin Core, which maintains the Bitcoin network. Hoffman’s is Protocol Guild, the equivalent organization in the Ethereum community.  When the news leaked on X last week, several commenters made fun of the fighters’ physiques and mocked their fighting skills. But the two are undeterred.  “At the end of the day, it’s me and David that are taking the risk and getting in the ring and all they can do is watch,” Carter said. “If they want to fight they can try and get in the undercard, they are welcome to reach out to Karate Combat. But David and I aren’t claiming to be amazing fighters. The objective is to entertain and take on a new challenge, not to begin decorated fight careers.”  “It’s been funny to hear all the haters who want to fight us,” adds Hoffman. “I have no interest in fighting anyone but Nic Carter.”  This is the 46th Karate Combat event and the second under the banner “Influencer Fight Club (IFC).” The first, featuring Ben “BitBoy” Armstrong and meme coin creator “More Light,” in Mexico City in February, drew hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. BitBoy beat the more-fancied More Light in a match full of aggression and flanging fists and arms.  Karate Combat founder ONLYLARPING said he wants the format to “be the first official sport of Web3.”  “It makes sense to partner with the biggest and best conferences in the world and the most entertaining influencers and founders.”  Research by Karate Combat found that a large percentage of its audience don’t enjoy sports unless there is a side-bet element to it. The platform has a no-loss gaming feature, where Karate token-holders plump for a winner and are given a small share of the prize money if they pick the right horse. If they pick the loser, they don’t give up anything.  The Karate Combat series at Consensus features six influencer fights and 10 more conventional bouts involving professional fighters. The action begins May 30 at 7 pm local time. Weigh-ins take place May 29 at 5 pm on the Town Square stage.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/03/texas-takedown-nic-carter-and-david-hoffman-square-off-for-karate-combat-at-consensus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1fc8ab5f0f06655305d8f0a5ae6bf06d4ef424f7-1280x1024.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

25171260,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601164,1712149206,"Ethena (ENA) Surges 60%, But Fantom Co-Founder Warns Of Luna-Like Demise","Ethena Labs’ new governance token, ENA, is witnessing a staggering 60% increase in its value, shortly after its introduction to the market. The spike in ENA’s price to approximately $0.96 has catapulted its market capitalization to nearly $1.34 billion, ranking ENA as the 80th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. This ascent followed Ethena’s strategic distribution of 750 million ENA tokens, representing 5% of its total supply, through an airdrop to holders of its USDe token. The USDe, a synthetic dollar, is central to Ethena’s offering, leveraging a blend of ether liquid staking tokens and short Ether (ETH) perpetual futures positions to maintain a target value near $1. The Ethena Labs airdrop went live 2 hours ago, with $450M of ENA to distribute. The largest $ENA recipient so far has been 0xb56, who received 3.30M ENA worth $1.96M. Track ENA on Arkham:https://t.co/coFsTcBUCa https://t.co/RSZwXLhCB6 pic.twitter.com/l6c7bqKghG — Arkham (@ArkhamIntel) April 2, 2024 At the heart of Ethena’s value proposition is the ENA token, engineered to facilitate a digital dollar platform on the Ethereum blockchain. This platform seeks to provide a viable alternative to conventional banking mechanisms through its innovative ‘Internet Bond’. By harnessing the potential of derivative markets and staked Ethereum, the Internet Bond offers a dollar-denominated savings instrument accessible globally, independent of traditional banking infrastructure. Related Reading: MakerDAO Initiates Massive $600 Million DAI Investment In USDe And sUSDe The total supply of ENA tokens is capped at 15 billion, with an initial issuance of 1.425 billion tokens. The distribution plan prioritizes ecosystem development (30%), core contributor rewards (30%), investor engagement (25%), and foundation support (15%), embodying a holistic approach to tokenomics. Notably, Binance’s endorsement of ENA as the 50th project on its Binance Launchpool, enabling users to farm ENA tokens by staking BNB and FDUSD, underscores the token’s appeal. At press time, ENA traded at $0.93, up 60% in the past 24 hours. Fantom Co-Founder Warns Of Luna-Like Collapse Andre Cronje, co-founder of the Fantom Foundation, issued a warning on X, recalling the concerns that preceded the collapse of Terra Luna. Cronje dissected the structure of perpetual contracts (perps), a derivative product that enables traders to speculate on the price movement of an asset without holding the actual asset. This mechanism operates on a system of funding rates meant to tether the perpetual price closely to the underlying asset’s spot price. However, Cronje highlighted a critical vulnerability in this system: the reliance on yield-generating assets, such as staked Ethereum (stETH), as collateral. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning? This approach theoretically allows for a “neutral” position, where the gains from yield should offset losses from the short position if the asset’s price drops. Yet, this equilibrium is precarious, as negative shifts in funding rates can erode the collateral, leading to liquidation. “The mechanism – the theory here is that you can generate a ‘stable’ $1000, by buying $1000 of stETH, using this as collateral to open a $1000 stETH short, thereby achieving being ‘neutral’, while getting the benefit of the stETH yield (~3%) + whatever is paid in funding rates,” Cronje explained. Cronje’s concerns are not unfounded. The crypto industry witnessed the dramatic implosion of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin UST in 2021, a debacle that resulted in significant financial losses across the board. By drawing a parallel between the structural weaknesses he perceives in Ethena’s framework and the mechanisms that led to Terra’s downfall, Cronje raises a red flag about the sustainability of complex financial products that lack transparent risk mitigation strategies. Every so often we see something new in this space. I often find myself on the mid curve for an extensive amount of time. I am comfortable here. That being said, there have been events in this industry I wish I was more curious about, there have also been events I definitely did… — Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) April 3, 2024 Responding to Cronje’s critique, the founder of Ethena Labs Guy Young aka Leptokurtic, acknowledged the validity of the concerns raised. “These aren’t mid curve concerns at all Andre Cronje, you rightly point out risks that absolutely do exist here. Will work on a longer form response for you by end of this week with some thoughts,” Young stated on X.

In February, Nigerian authorities detained Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, the exchange's regional manager for Africa, has since charged Binance and the two executives with tax evasion.  Binance's Head of Financial Crime Compliance Tigran Gambaryan, detained in Nigeria by local authorities, has no decision-making power at the company and should not be held responsible in ongoing discussions between the exchange and government officials, the crypto exchange said in a Wednesday statement.  Nigerian authorities invited, then detained, Gambaryan and the exchange's Regional Manager for Africa, Nadeem Anjarwalla, in February. Anjarwalla made headlines in March for having reportedly escaped custody. Around the same time, Nigeria's tax authority filed charges of tax evasion against Binance and the two executives.  Gambaryan and Anjarwalla have filed a suit in the Federal High Court in Nigeria's capital Abuja, stating that their human rights had been violated.  Local news outlets have reported that the court plans to arraign the two executives (Anjarwalla in absentia) on April 4.  ""Binance respectfully requests that Tigran Gambaryan, who has no decision-making power in the company, is not held responsible while current discussions are ongoing between Binance and Nigerian government officials,"" the exchange said in Wednesday's blog post, akin to a character statement.  The Nigerian government has accused the crypto exchange of operating illegally in the country and tampering with the exchange rate for the Nigerian naira.

42418498,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTGH,1712147140,Bermuda-Licensed Relm Insurance Unveils Suite of Crypto Risk Products,"Relm Insurance, regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, is offering a five-product suite of crypto cover offerings.  As well as cyber and wallet custody cover, Relm is providing professional liability insurance for crypto trading, as well as cover for losses relating to staking assets on the Ethereum blockchain.  Relm Insurance, a specialty insurance carrier regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, has unveiled a new suite of products covering a range of cryptocurrency-related risks, from wallets to investment management.  Relm, which also provides insurance to emerging industries like cannabis and psychedelics, has created a five-part offering for digital asset risks, such as cyber cover, crime coverage for holding crypto in hot wallets (connected to the internet), or covering investment managers of digital assets funds. In addition, there are more esoteric cover options like reimbursement for losses associated with staking Ethereum, where a participant can have their assets “slashed” for being offline, for example.  Adequate insurance cover for crypto has traditionally been hard to come by, and tended to be focused on two areas: commercial crime market – which covers things like cash in ATMs or moved around in armored cars – and the specie market, which is focused on specially designed vaults and the like, for storing high value items like gold bullion or art.  There has also been a lack of capacity when it comes to crypto risks, but that might be changing. Insurance broker Marsh recently announced an $850 million insurance offering covering cold storage, as well other custody solutions such as Multi-Party Computation (MPC), where cryptographic keys are split into shards.  Over the past several years, Relm has provided insurance cover to exchanges, payment and remittance platforms, custodians, software developers, and foundations that anchor decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for some of the biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, said the insurer’s CEO Joseph Ziolkowski, without naming any companies.  Ziolkowski said his new product suite applies to areas within crypto where there is a dearth of cover available and the capacity limits depends on each company and situation.  “If you look at the amount of capacity in London for something like cold storage, or specie cover, it's the most basic exposures arising from digital asset operations, and as a result, there's massive amounts of capacity that exists,” Ziolkowski said in an interview. “We deal with much more complex exposures that have far fewer markets that are willing to put their balance sheet on the line for these types of products.”",POSITIVE,없음,ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/03/bermuda-licensed-relm-insurance-unveils-suite-of-crypto-risk-products,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/80ee723f9b23726a0866bc0e26173d7f1d68e083-3504x2336.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Ethena Labs’ ENA token, introduced on Tuesday, almost doubled in price overnight. Ethena Labs is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that offers the $1.3 billion yield-earning USDe (known as a “synthetic dollar”), and ENA is its new governance token. ENA is currently trading at around $0.93, up 49% in the past 24 hours. The token began trading on April 2 at around $0.60. A number of cryptocurrency exchanges have listed the token, including the world’s largest, Binance. The price rally pushed the token’s market value up to $1.3 billion, ranking it in 67th place among other projects in terms of market capitalization. The project has also received positive attention from former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes on X. Hayes said he sees the price going up to $10.  Bitcoin’s (BTC) steep rally has recently lost impetus. Still, the supply of stablecoins or dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, often considered a powder keg that could be used to fund token purchases, continues to rise, a sign of reassuring stability to bitcoin bulls. Bitcoin hit record highs above $73,500 on March 14 and has since struggled to keep gains above $70,000, mainly due to the dwindling probability of a Fed rate cut in June. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $66,300, down 10% from its all-time high. Meantime, the cumulative supply of the top three stablecoins, tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and DAI (DAI) – which dominate the stablecoin market with over 90% share – increased by 2.1% to $141.42 billion, the highest since May 2022. The cumulative supply is up over $20 billion this year.  The crypto-related venture capital (VC) firm Paradigm is looking to raise between $750 million and $850 million for a new fund, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg said if the deal is completed at the lower end of the range, it would still mark the industry's biggest since the recent crypto winter. Paradigm, founded by Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam and former Sequoia partner Matt Huan, previously raised $2.5 billion for a fund during the height of the bull run in November 2021. The report comes as the crypto industry is enjoying a bull run that started after spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were given the green light by the SEC to trade in the U.S.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows MacroMicro's global recession probability based on various economic indicators such as consumption, employment, manufacturing, finance and raw materials.  As of end-March, the probability of the global economy slipping into a recession was 34%. A consistent reading above 50% signals an impending recession, as in 2000 and 2008.  The low probability of a recession means the Federal Reserve and other major central banks may be less aggressive in cutting interest rates.

25169382,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601160,1712145643,"Bitcoin ETF Outflows Are Ramping Up Again, What Does This Mean For BTC Price?","Bitcoin ETF outflows are on the rise once again after a change in the tide last week. These outflows, given the ETFs’ correlation with the Bitcoin price, have a substantial impact on how well the cryptocurrency performs over time. So, as outflows are ramping up, will it trigger a crash in the BTC price? ARK Invest And Grayscale Lead Outflows While Grayscale’s Spot Bitcoin ETF has been the natural culprit for ETF outflows due to its high fees, another fund has joined the trend in a surprising turn of events. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest saw a substantial outflow from its ETF, leading to a new record for the investment firm. Related Reading: Solana Whales Are Making Moves – Here’s The Direction They’re Headed In The Ark 21Shares Fund (ARKB) saw a record $87.5 million leave its fund on Tuesday, April 2. Interestingly, the fund’s outflows were even higher than that of Grayscale, which saw around $81.9 million in outflows in the same day. For both these funds, it marked the second consecutive day of outflows, although it was more concerning on the part of the Ark 21Shares Fund. This is because Grayscale saw a decline in outflows between Monday and Tuesday, going from $302.6 million to $81.9 million. Whereas the ARK Invest fund saw outflows go from $0.3 million on Monday to $87.5 million on Tuesday, resulting in a 29,000% increase in outflows in a single day. Only these two funds have experienced outflows this week though, as the other ETFs continue to see upside. While Monday’s net flows ended up being negative to the tune of $85.7 million, Tuesday’s numbers looked better with positive net flows of $40.3 million. How Will This Affect Bitcoin Price? Since the Spot Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January, their effect on the Bitcoin price has been positive overall. However, there have been points where outflows from the funds have affected the BTC price, causing it to crash. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Major Roadblock As Whales Go On Massive Selling Spree A few instances of this is back in January, a week after the ETFs were first approved. Outflows had plagued the funds and the Bitcoin price had declined as a result. Then again, in March, when outflows turned negative between March 18 and March 22 and the Bitcoin price crashed from $73,000 to $61,000. Given BTC’s performance during periods where outflows prevail in Spot ETFs, this current trend does not bode well for the price.

The company offers a patented flavor of cold storage, a process of creating, signing and sending messages to the blockchain without ever being connected to the internet.  The first client to use the Tokenization Wizard will be a partnership between asset manager DWS, Flow Traders and Galaxy itself to manage a fully collateralized euro-denominated stablecoin.  GK8, the crypto currency custody firm acquired by Galaxy Digital just over a year ago, has introduced Tokenization Wizard, a platform for building blockchain-based versions of real-world assets, as well as securely managing stablecoins and assorted Web3 applications.  Demand for tokenization has risen sharply, with many traditional finance firms getting on board. Among them, asset management giant BlackRock, which recently unveiled its BUIDL platform in association with Securitize and others.  GK8’s tokenization engine follows strict principles of self-custody, the firm’s co-founder and CEO Lior Lamesh said. That contrasts with the managed custody offered by Coinbase and many other major crypto custody providers.  In addition, GK8 offers its own patented flavor of cold storage, a process of creating, signing and sending messages to the blockchain in the form of outputs only, avoiding any connection to the internet. This is paired with multiparty computation (MPC), a popular method of splitting up cryptographic keys.  “Blockchain is an interactive protocol and at some point, according to the transaction structure, there are some mandatory data that you should receive from the internet,” Lamesh said in an interview. “We have seven patents in different stages around cryptographic innovations that enable us to avoid the mandatory step of receiving input from the internet, allowing us to use only outbound unidirectional communication to send and sign transactions. Since there are never any inputs, we are never exposed to any cybersecurity attack vectors.”  The first client to use the Tokenization Wizard will be a partnership between asset manager DWS, Flow Traders and Galaxy to manage a fully collateralized euro-denominated stablecoin, GK8 said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/04/03/galaxy-digital-owned-crypto-custody-specialist-gk8-unveils-tokenization-wizard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0280fe85eecf31c20cd6a9a7d3059e8b2fc5c514-4963x2792.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While the burn rate, a metric indicating the rate at which tokens are permanently removed from circulation, skyrocketed by over 4,000% in the past 24 hours, the token’s price continues to decline. Related Reading: Canine Comeback? KNINE Brushes Off 50% Loss, Gets Listed On Major Exchange This surge in burning activity, primarily attributed to the destruction of over 154 million SHIB tokens, has ignited a spark of optimism within the SHIB community. The burning process aims to reduce the overall supply of SHIB, potentially leading to scarcity and a subsequent price increase. Additionally, the community burning large amounts of tokens signifies their confidence in the project’s future. In the past 24 hours, there have been a total of 154,999,579 $SHIB tokens burned and 4 transactions. Visit https://t.co/t0eRMnyZel to view the overall total of #SHIB tokens burned, circulating supply, and more. pic.twitter.com/rhajRJLTud — Shibburn (@shibburn) April 3, 2024 Shiba Inu Price Sluggish Despite Massive Burn However, despite the burning frenzy, the current market sentiment seems to be dictating SHIB’s price more heavily. As of today, April 3rd, SHIB is trading around $0.000026, reflecting a significant drop. This price correction aligns with the broader crypto market downturn, suggesting that external factors are currently outweighing the burn rate’s potential impact. Further dampening investor spirits is a decline in trading activity. Data suggests a decrease in open interest, which indicates the number of outstanding SHIB futures contracts, and a drop in derivatives volume, both pointing towards reduced investor participation. This lack of enthusiasm could further hinder any immediate price recovery. SHIB market cap currently at $16.5 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Last week, Shiba Inu (SHIB) experienced a 12% price decline on a weekly basis, trailing behind other popular tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE). Despite this setback, there is optimism for SHIB’s future growth, as noted by analyst Captain Faibik (CryptoFaibik on X). Referring to data from a 6-hour chart, the analyst points out the formation of a symmetrical triangle, a pattern considered bullish by traders due to its characteristic of lower highs and higher lows. $SHIB #Shiba another 2x Bullish Rally incoming ✍️ pic.twitter.com/srIRdxAfPm — Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) March 31, 2024 Typically, during a consolidation period, the asset price in a symmetrical triangle will fluctuate within narrower levels. The market is typically showing signs of hesitation when this happens. The Road Ahead For SHIB Looking ahead, analysts are divided. Some crypto enthusiasts believe the ongoing burning will eventually lead to a scenario where buying pressure overwhelms the selling pressure, driving the price up. However, if the broader market weakness persists, SHIB could revisit its Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00002368.

Robinhood’s share price rose sharply as retail engagement accelerated.  The big question is how long the recent acceleration in retail trading will last, the report said.  The key question for trading platform Robinhood (HOOD) is how long the recent acceleration in retail trading will last, broker KBW said in a research report that initiated coverage of the stock with a market perform rating and a $20 price target.  KBW notes that retail engagement materially ramped up in the first quarter, helping drive the share price up 150% in only four months.  If there is continued strength in retail stocks and cryptocurrency prices, the acceleration in retail engagement could continue and may even increase, the report published Tuesday said.  Still, the stock price has already “adequately captured the baseline upside” from new product launches and has started to “price in a higher level of normalized retail trading activity,” analysts led by Kyle Voigt wrote.  Retail activity is expected to moderate from the levels seen in the first quarter and gradually decline into 2025, the note said.  The U.S. self-directed brokerage industry is one of the quickest growing sectors of the broader U.S. wealth market, and “Robinhood is positioned as a small (but quickly growing) player in a secularly growing industry,” the report added.  “With Robinhood only having ~1% share of U.S. self-directed assets, but ~20% share of estimated total U.S. self-direct brokerage accounts, we believe there is room for HOOD to outpace the overall asset growth in the self-directed industry as its core client cohort matures,” the authors wrote.  Robinhood shares closed at $19.20 on Tuesday, and have gained over 50% year-to-date.

42418503,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTLR,1712136957,Crypto AI Projects Would Need to Buy Chips Worth Their Entire Market Cap to Meet Ambitions,"The possibility of text-to-video generation excites the crypto market, and AI tokens rose when OpenAI first unveiled a demo of Sora  But to make this mainstream the compute power will be staggering. More server-grade H100 GPUs will be required than Nvidia produces in a year, or what its largest customers run in their data centers collectively.     How many Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) will be required to make text-to-video generation mainstream? Hundreds of thousands – and more than are currently in use by Microsoft, Meta and Google combined.  The first demo of OpenAI's text-to-video generator Sora amazed the world, and this renewed interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) tokens, with many surging in the aftermath of the demo.  In the weeks that followed, many crypto AI projects emerged, also promising to do text-to-video and text-to-image generation, and the AI token category now has a $25 billion market cap according to CoinGecko data.  Behind the promise of AI-generated videos are armies of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), the processors from the likes of Nvidia and AMD, which make the AI revolution possible thanks to their ability to compute large volumes of data.  But just how many GPUs will it take to make AI-generated video a mainstream thing? More than major big tech companies had in their arsenal in 2023.  An Army of 720,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs  A recent research report by Factorial Funds estimates that 720,000 high-end Nvidia H100 GPUs are required to support the creator community of TikTok and YouTube.  Sora, Factorial Funds writes, requires up to 10,500 powerful GPUs for a month to train, and can generate only about 5 minutes of video per hour per GPU for inference.  As the chart above demonstrates, training this requires significantly more compute power than GPT4 or still image generation.  With widespread adoption, inference will surpass training in compute usage. This means that as more people and companies start using AI models like Sora to generate videos, the computer power needed to create new videos (inference) will become greater than the power needed to train the AI model initially.  To put things in perspective, Nvidia shipped 550,000 of the H100 GPUs in 2023.  Data from Statista shows that the twelve largest customers using Nvidia's H100 GPUs collectively have 650,000 of the cards, and the two largest—Meta and Microsoft—have 300,000 between them.  Assuming a cost of $30,000 per card, it would take $21.6 billion to bring Sora's dreams of AI-generated text-to-video mainstream, which is nearly the entire market cap of AI tokens at the moment.  That's if you can physically acquire all the GPUs to do it.  Nvidia isn't the only game in town  While Nvidia is synonymous with the AI revolution, it's important to remember that it's not the only game in town.  Its perennial chip rival AMD makes competing products, and investors have also handsomely rewarded the company, pushing its stock from the $2 range in the fall of 2012 to over $175 today.  There are also other ways to outsource computing power to GPU farms. Render {{RNDR}} offers distributed GPU computing, as does Akash Network {{AKT}}. But the majority of the GPUs on these networks are retail-grade gaming GPUs which are significantly less powerful than Nvidia's server-grade H100 or AMD's competition.  Regardless, the promise of text-to-video, which Sora and other protocols promise, is going to require a herculean hardware lift. While it's an intriguing premise and could revolutionize Hollywood's creative workflow, don't expect it to become mainstream anytime soon.  We're going to need more chips.",NEUTRAL,RNDR | AKT,BUSINESS | MARKET | RESEARCH | RNDR | AKT,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/03/ai-crypto-tokens-love-openais-sora-narrative-but-the-compute-power-to-scale-it-is-enormous,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2181f663475c665d3f393a86dd63de77580ab2b9-2400x1347.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418495,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTDB,1712134800,Bitfinex Derivatives Users Can Now Place Bets on Bitcoin and Ether Implied Volatility,"Bitfinex Derivatives unveils perpetual futures tied to Volmex Finance’s bitcoin and ether implied volatility indices.  Users can now place bets on the degree of price turbulence in the top two cryptocurrencies.  Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex announced the launch of perpetual futures tied to bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} volatility indices, allowing traders to place bets on expected price turbulence in the leading cryptocurrencies.  The new futures are based on the decentralized derivatives platform Volmex’s bitcoin implied volatility index (BVIV) and ether implied volatility index (EVIV).  Both indices are derived from real-time bitcoin and ether call and put options and indicate the expected price turbulence over 30 days. Per Volmex, the two indices are analogous to Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX index, which is derived from the options market tied to the S&P 500 index.  Starting April 3, Bitfinex users can trade bitcoin and ether volatility futures under the ticker symbols BVIVF0:USTFO and EVIVFO:USDTFO, according to the press release shared with CoinDesk. These contracts are denominated, margined, and settled in tether (USDT), the world’s largest dollar-pegged stablecoin.  Perpetuals are futures contracts with no expiry and a funding rate mechanism that helps keep prices for perpetuals in sync with the underlying asset/index.  The availability of volatility futures means Bitfinex users can bet on how fast the anticipated bullish or bearish price move in bitcoin and ether will happen. Being long volatility means betting the asset’s price might move violently in either direction.  The volatility futures will help traders navigate binary events like crucial U.S. economic data releases, Fed rate decisions, and crypto-specific events that have the potential to inject volatility into the market and open doors to retail investors who lack the resources or expertise to set up complex options strategies like straddles and strangles to profit from changes in implied volatility.

42418506,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTNV,1712133943,Stablecoin Expansion Continues as Bitcoin Rally Appears to Stall,"The cumulative supply of the top three stablecoins – USDT, USDC, and DAI – has increased to $141.42 billion, the highest since May 2022.  The data indicates that capital continues to flow into the crypto market.  Other indicators like bitcoin’s MVRV Z-score suggest there is plenty of upside left in the top cryptocurrency by market value.  Bitcoin’s {{BTC}} steep rally has recently lost impetus. Still, the supply of stablecoins or dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, often considered a powder keg that could be used to fund token purchases, continues to rise, reassuring stability to bitcoin bulls.  Bitcoin hit record highs above $73,500 on March 14 and has since struggled to keep gains above $70,000, mainly due to the dwindling probability of Fed rate cuts in June. At press time, the leading cryptocurrency by market value was changing hands at $66,300, down 10% from its all-time high.  However, during the same time, the cumulative supply of the top three stablecoins, tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), and DAI (DAI), which dominate the stablecoin market with over 90% share, increased by 2.1% to $141.42 billion, reaching its highest level since May 2022, according to data from charting platform TradingView. The cumulative supply is up over $20 billion this year.  The continued expansion in the supply of stablecoins, a proxy for liquidity, is a positive sign for the crypto market, according to Reflexivity Research.  “As this [stablecoin supply] continues to trend up, this shows that capital continues to flow into crypto markets,"" Reflexivity Research said in a newsletter dated April 2.  In other words, dip demand for bitcoin could be strong, and the broader uptrend may soon resume.  Over the years, stablecoins led by tether have emerged as the primary mechanism for purchasing cryptocurrencies in the spot market and trading derivatives. Since late 2021, traders have increasingly preferred crypto futures margined and settled in stablecoins than token-margined ones.  Stablecoin-margined futures offer a linear payoff where the value of the collateral remains steady irrespective of market volatility. As such, traders do not have to constantly look for hedging their collateral.  Other indicators like the Z-score of bitcoin’s market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio also indicate that the path of least resistance is on the higher side.  The MVRV Z-score measures the market value’s deviation from the realized value. The latter approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by adding the market value of coins when they last moved on the blockchain and is considered a proxy for fair value.  Historically, a below-zero MVRV Z-score ( has marked market bottoms, while a reading above seven has marked tops. Glassnode data show, at press time, the Z-score was 2.87, a sign bitcoin is far from being overbought or near a major market top.",POSITIVE,BTC | USDT | DAI,BTC | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | DAI,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/03/stablecoin-expansion-continues-as-bitcoin-rally-appears-to-stall,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/71a4dceed2838f54ff01dfda3f02196a67c71185-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
25162822,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601125,1712133644,Asia’s Bitcoin Volatility Linked To Algos Tracking ETF Flows,"Recent Bitcoin price volatility in Asia has been closely linked to automated trading algorithms that monitor flows in US exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to Bloomberg, this algorithmic trading response to daily US ETF flow data is causing pronounced swings in Bitcoin prices during Asian trading hours. Trading Algos Spoil The Bitcoin Price The trigger for Bitcoin’s steep decline, marking its worst drop in a month, was observed on Tuesday morning in Asia. This downturn coincided with the release of US ETF flows data, which indicated a net withdrawal of investments. Shiliang Tang, president of Arbelos Markets, highlighted the impact of algorithmic trading on these market movements. “From an algorithmic trading perspective, bots can basically auto-scrape this data and buy and sell based on this,” Tang explained. “It seems that’s basically what is happening.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Hits 10% After Crash: What Happened Last Time The introduction of several Bitcoin ETFs in the United States on January 11 has since attracted a net $12 billion in investments. These ETFs experienced a surge in inflows, especially in the first half of March, propelling Bitcoin to a record high of $73,798. However, the premier cryptocurrency has seen a decline of up to 17.6% from this peak, amidst fluctuating inflows and outflows within the sector. This pattern of flows has notably impacted the Asian market’s returns, with February and early March witnessing particularly strong performance, which diminished later in the month. The influence of algorithmic protocols on Bitcoin’s price not only affects the spot market but extends to derivatives as well, with Coinglass reporting about $357 million in bullish crypto bets being liquidated on Tuesday alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Tumbles Below $66,000: 4 Major Reasons Charlie Morris, Chief Investment Officer at ByteTree Asset Management, pointed out the significance of ETF flows for Bitcoin compared to gold, noting that 5.5% of Bitcoin is held in ETFs, against 1% for gold. This makes ETF flows a more critical factor for Bitcoin’s market movements. Market participants like Jakob Kronbichler, co-founder of Clearpool Finance, emphasize the market’s responsiveness to ETF flow data and suggest the recent correction as a natural pause for the market to “take a bit of a breather” amidst widespread excitement. Spot ETFs Rake In $40 Million Yesterday, all spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced an inflow totaling $40.3 million, primarily due to Blackrock’s significant contribution of $150.5 million, which played a crucial role in boosting the market. On the contrary, ARK faced a challenging day with $87.9 million in outflows, despite having $200 million inflows the previous week. Grayscale’s GBTC saw rather low outflows, amounting to $81.9 million. Renowned analyst WhalePanda commented: “Maybe profit taking after Q1? Speculation though. Mondays always seem to have the most outflows and wondering if end of Q1 had something to do with it as I suspect. Price crashed further on US government moving/selling some of the BTC from Silk Road. Better to sell here than at $100k or $200k. 17 days until halving.” At press time, BTC traded at $66,398.

The broker believes the crypto exchange offers unique exposure to the long-term growth of the crypto economy.  Coinbase’s trading activity continues to surge, with daily volume for March averaging $5.1 billion, the report said.  Coinbase (COIN) offers investors unique exposure to the long-term growth of the crypto economy, KBW said in a research report on Tuesday.  KBW raised its Coinbase price target to $230 from $160 while maintaining its market perform rating. The crypto exchange’s stock closed at $245.84 on Tuesday, having risen over 40% year-to-date.  “We see a significant near-term revenue opportunity from inflecting USD Coin (USDC) outstanding balances, elevated crypto asset levels, and an apparent retail re-engagement from trough levels in 2023,” analysts led by Kyle Voigt wrote.  USDC outstanding balances continue to grow, rising 32% in the first quarter, the report said. USDC is a stablecoin issued by Circle, which is itself backed by Coinbase. The crypto exchange earns gross interest income on about 56% of USDC outstanding balances, KBW said.  Surging trading volumes are also a tailwind for the stock, with March average daily volume (ADV) of $5.1 billion versus $2.4 billion in February, the report added.  Still, Coinbase’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the uncertain regulatory environment make it very difficult for many institutional investors to own the stock, the authors wrote.

25160644,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601124,1712129672,"Canine Comeback? KNINE Brushes Off 50% Loss, Gets Listed On Major Exchange","Shiba Inu’s Layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, is experiencing a shot of optimism amidst a bearish crypto market. K9 Finance (KNINE), a project aiming to become the go-to platform for liquid staking derivatives (LSD) on Shibarium, has secured a listing on BitMart, a major cryptocurrency exchange. This move, coupled with the upcoming launch of the K9 Finance dApp, is seen as a potential catalyst for growth within the Shibarium ecosystem. Related Reading: Cardano Rides The ETF Wave: Inflows Surge To Over $1 Million – Details K9 Finance offers functionality similar to Lido Finance on Ethereum. Lido allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) while receiving Lido Staked Ether (stETH) which can be used for further DeFi activities. K9 Finance envisions a similar mechanism for Shibarium, enabling users to stake their tokens and receive a liquid derivative in return. This not only increases participation in the Shibarium network but also unlocks additional utility for staked assets. Official $SHIB Partner $KNINE will list on @BitMartExchange Tomorrow. Congrats on the new listing. Let’s Moon Together! 🔥🚀 https://t.co/rHApwjJMAu — $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) April 1, 2024 KNINE Price At A Glance At the time of writing, the price of the KNINE token has decreased by 9% over the previous 24 hours and is worth $0.00009063. As a result, SHIB’s companion token gained a bearish hue today, in contrast to the optimistic sentiments that arose in response to the listing announcement. Despite securing a significant exchange listing, the K9 Finance DAO (KNINE) token experienced a sharp decline of 50% over the past 14 days, plunging 75% from its all-time high of $0.0003468 on March 10, 2024. KNINE’s drop today looks to be consistent with the overall slump in Shiba Inu, since SHIB’s stock also fell significantly on Wednesday. Shiba Inu traded at $0.00002692, down nearly 11% in the last 24 hours, fueling speculation about potential price swings. Total crypto market cap at $2.4 trillion on the daily chart: TradingView.com The listing on BitMart, the 44th largest crypto exchange by monthly traffic, is a significant win for K9 Finance. It provides increased exposure and liquidity for the KNINE token, potentially attracting new investors and users to the Shibarium ecosystem. Major Developments Ahead Adding further fuel to the fire, K9 Finance recently unveiled a sneak peek of its upcoming dApp. The platform will reportedly utilize Shiba Inu’s BONE token for validator rewards. Users who stake their BONE on K9 Finance will receive a wrapped version (knBONE) while their original tokens remain locked, allowing them to participate in governance and earn rewards simultaneously. This integration with BONE creates a symbiotic relationship between the two projects and incentivizes participation within the wider Shibarium ecosystem. Related Reading: Investor Alert: Ethereum Q2 Potential Promises Double-Digit Gains – Analyst While K9 Finance paints a promising picture for Shibarium’s future, some factors require consideration. The current crypto market slump could lead to price volatility for KNINE. Additionally, the overall success of K9 Finance hinges on the wider adoption of Shibarium itself. As a relatively new Layer-2 solution, Shibarium needs to attract developers and users to establish a robust ecosystem.

42418500,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTHJ,1712120809,Bitcoin Back Down to $66K as Rising Treasury Yields Catch Investor Interest,"Bitcoin hovers near $66,000, with the CoinDesk20 Index signaling broader market weakness.  Crypto futures rates and open interest have decreased, signaling a potential end to a two-month rally.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} held on to losses during the Asian trading hours on Tuesday, trading at around $66,000, as traders digested resurgent Treasury yields and the possibility that the Fed might delay rate cuts until later this year.  At the time of writing, ether {{ETH}} changed hands above $3,300, while the CoinDesk 20 (CD20) was down 0.6% to 2,532.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury note clocked a two-week high of 4.40% overnight due to persistent inflation and unexpectedly strong manufacturing activity. An uptick in the so-called risk-free rate typically spurs an outflow of money from risk assets and zero-yielding investments like gold. The yellow metal, however, remained resilient amid the weak tone in bitcoin and Wall Street’s tech-heavy index, Nasdaq.  “Bitcoin retraced down to $65,000, mostly attributed to the recent macro outlook on interest rates and rising Treasury yields,” Semir Gabeljic, director of capital formation at Pythagoras Investments, said in an email interview. “Higher interest rate environments typically tend to reduce investor appetite to risk.”  On Polymarket, bettors have ruled out a rate cut by May and are split 50-50 on whether one will happen in June. Most of the certain money is on it happening in the fall.  The CME Fed Watch tool has a 97% chance of rates staying the same after May’s meeting.  Coinglass data shows that over $245 million in long positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours, with $60 million in BTC positions getting rekt.  “Perpetual futures funding rates for most crypto assets are back to 1bps, and global futures open interest decreased by 10 percent overnight, indicating some leveraged long positions are closed,” Jun-Young Heo, a Derivatives Trader at Singapore-baed Presto, added.  “As recent bitcoin ETF inflows are stagnating and BTC and ETH market prices came below the 20-day moving average, some trend followers would have regarded yesterday’s downturn as the end of a two-month-long rally,” he continued.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/04/03/btc-back-down-to-66k-as-rising-treasury-yields-catch-investor-interest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55b23b2640f44f23fd24e466c26cff3fd9bdf0dd-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Grayscale Litecoin Trust is currently trading at a 407.6% premium to its net asset value, which is not justified by fundamentals. Private placements are being opened by LTCN to address market inefficiency, potentially providing an opportunity for premium arbitrage. Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) is one of the many Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) forks in the cryptocurrency market. As an earlier fork, LTC is one of the oldest coins in the market and is not generally viewed as one of the more exciting opportunities in the digital asset space. Despite that, Litecoin has maintained a robust user base compared to most of the older proof-of-work coins as the network has generally averaged over a quarter of a million daily active users for the last two years. 30 Day Avg Active Addresses (CoinMetrics) I've written about the network a handful of times for Seeking Alpha through the years. You can certainly consider me a proponent of Litecoin as it remains sort of the crypto of choice for peer-to-peer payments at times of high fees in Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ). By certain measures, LTC is arguably one of the more interesting coins in the market. Given the lack of hype in the coin, I have historically viewed LTC as a contrarian pick among typical crypto investors. 30 Day Avg NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) If you like valuation metrics, LTC's 30 day average Net Value to Transactions Ratio (NVT ratio) is currently 54. This ratio divides the market capitalization of each coin by the dollar-denominated value transferred over the network. Compared to other proof-of-work blockchain networks like Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ), and Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), Litecoin can realistically be viewed as ""cheap."" What likely can't be viewed as ""cheap"" is the Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTCN). Grayscale Litecoin Trust When I last covered LTCN , I said investors should be careful chasing the fund as it was trading at a premium to Net Asset Value, or NAV. At that time, the premium to NAV that I found to be problematic was just 7%. This is child's play compared to where speculators have since taken LTCN: Grayscale Litecoin Trust, as 4/2/24 close LTC Per Share 0.08587164 LTC Price $107.49 LTCN Value $9.23 LTCN Price $46.85 Premium 407.6% Implied LTC Price $438.10 Source: Grayscale, Author's calculations As of market close on April 2nd, 2024, LTCN commands a 407.6% premium to NAV. Since the sole purpose of the fund is to offer investors exposure to Litecoin and nothing more, buying LTCN for $46.85 when the LTC value of each share is $9.23 is fundamentally no different than paying $407 for a $100 gift card. This might make sense if one expects to be able to sell that $100 gift card for $500 or even $600 shortly after, but this is more reflective of mania behavior rather than anything fundamentally driven. LTCN NAV Rate History (CoinGlass) As I see it, one of the major problems driving this action is the fact that LTCN has a history of trading at what I view to be preposterous premiums to NAV. During the height of the previous LTCN mania in late 2020, the fund shares briefly traded at almost a 6,000% premium to NAV. Judging from some of the comments in my other crypto-proxy articles from March, I suspect today's LTCN buyers are expecting the fund's premiums to reach those wild levels again simply because it has happened before. Given Grayscale's reopening of private placements, I have my doubts that premiums can hit those 2020 high levels again. Private Place Opportunity? During crypto-winter, investors wanted out of crypto-proxies and Grayscale's products were notoriously bludgeoned. At the depths of the bear market in late 2022, LTCN traded at a 65% discount to NAV. In late December 2022, arb traders could buy $6 of LTC for $2 via LTCN shares. Since all but one of Grayscale's single-asset crypto products are closed-end funds rather than spot ETFs, investors couldn't buy shares of LTCN under NAV and redeem the shares for the underlying assets to pocket the spread. If such an opportunity were available to investors, it is unlikely the discount in LTCN would have ever reached such depressed levels as it did in 2022. Fortunately, when premiums in Grayscale's single asset funds get out of hand - as they are currently - the company can open up private placements to address the market inefficiency and that is exactly what is happening now: Grayscale LTC Holdings (CoinGlass) After roughly two and half years of Grayscale's Litecoin holdings going down due to the fund's 2.5% management fee, LTC is once again coming back into the Grayscale Litecoin Trust through share issuance via private placement: Shares Outstanding April 2nd, 2024 18,258,500 End of 2023 17,204,700 Change 6.13% Source: Grayscale Since the start of the year, LTCN's outstanding share total has increased by just over 6%. This is not yet indicative of a significant push from accredited investors to try to capture the premium spread. That means there could be an opportunity to play the arb from the other side as any private placements today would likely be among the first shares out when lockup expires. So if you believe the LTCN premium can hold up (or even grow) over the next 12 months, a smart way to play that thesis may be taking the private placement at NAV and selling the shares on secondary after lockup to pocket the spread. But again, past performance is not an indication of future returns. There is absolutely no guarantee that LTCN's premium will hit the levels it hit during the 2020 bull run. As the shares outstanding have increased, it appears as though related parties to Grayscale may be selling shares in the fund. Per the latest 10-Q for LTCN, related party ownership fell about 15% from over 1.1 million shares at the end of June 2023 to roughly 956k shares at the end of December. Investment Risks Even if there was no premium and the fund traded more closely with the NAV, LTCN isn't a competitive investment product at this point in time. Litecoin can easily be purchased directly in crypto-specific IRA products that are offered by companies like iTrustCapital without such a high annual fee. Furthermore, LTC that is stored in the fund is held in custody rather than being put to work through yield-producing protocols like THORChain ( RUNE-USD ). At current THORFi Savers rates, paying 2.5% to keep LTC with Grayscale rather than earning 5.8% via THORFi presents a more than 8% opportunity cost that compounds annually. Summary At a $46.85 share price, LTCN is implying a $438 Litecoin price. I'd love a $438 LTC price as much as the next Litecoin bull, but LTCN's premium simply has no fundamental justification. This fund traded at an even larger premium about 3 years ago. That doesn't mean we'll see those NAV rate levels return this time around. That said, the smart money can probably play this from both sides. The only question is whether or not the premium can outlast the lockup. I wouldn't bet the mortgage on it.",NEUTRAL,BCH | LTC,BCH | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4681858-grayscale-litecoin-trust-implying-438-ltc-price-ltcn-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/25153594.jpeg

42418504,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThTMT,1712111400,What a Judge Said About the SEC's Suit Against Coinbase,"Between Coinbase, Custodia, Roman Storm and Sam Bankman-Fried, there was a lot of news last week. Let's get to it.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Big week  The narrative  Coinbase and Custodia both lost early and preliminary court fights. The Coinbase loss was more or less expected – companies rarely win much on a motion for judgment at such an early stage – but still pretty enlightening.  Why it matters  At some point the cases involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are going to move to appeals courts and maybe even the U.S. Supreme Court, if they're not settled first. Until that point, these decisions in the district court are shedding light on how judges view the crypto industry.  Breaking it down  Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled mostly against Coinbase after an initial motion for judgment, dismissing the SEC's claims about Coinbase Wallet but leaving a substantial part of the complaint intact.  The usual disclaimers apply: This is an initial motion and the judge was bound to accept the SEC's complaint's facts as alleged. We also don't usually see cases fully dismissed at this stage anyway, so the chances of Coinbase succeeding were also pretty slim.  That said, the judge drew a pretty clear roadmap in her 84-page ruling, taking on common industry arguments about whether crypto meets the standards for the major questions doctrine (no), what a cryptocurrency ecosystem means in terms of this kind of litigation (more on this later), whether there needs to be a written contract to satisfy the terms of an ""investment contract"" as defined in SEC v. Howey (no) and whether some of the assets the SEC named in its complaint are securities (it's plausible). In her ruling, the judge rejected some of Coinbase's arguments about how cryptos could be treated in the U.S.  As far as the major questions doctrine goes, Judge Failla agreed with Judge Jed Rakoff, who's in the same district, in ruling that the crypto industry does not meet the Supreme Court's standards for what might be a major industry. In doing so, she became the latest judge to say that the SEC is well within its bounds to pursue enforcement actions and regulate crypto, and does not need a Congressional mandate. Failla agreed with Rakoff in other parts of her order as well.  ""Contrary to Defendants’ assertions, neither Howey nor its progeny have held that profits to be expected in a common enterprise are limited just to shares in income, profits, or assets of a business,"" the judge wrote, also pointing to another Supreme Court decision.  Again citing Rakoff, Failla said a common enterprise would exist if a token issuer used proceeds from a token sale ""to further develop the tokens' broader 'ecosystem.'""  Judge Failla explicitly rejected an argument that there needs to be a formal contract for an ""investment contract"" to exist, pushing back against another fairly common argument in these kinds of cases.  ""To begin, there need not be a formal contract between transacting parties for an investment contract to exist under Howey,"" she wrote. ""Indeed, courts in this Circuit have consistently declined invitations by defendants in the cryptocurrency industry to insert a 'contractually-grounded' requirement into the Howey analysis.""  Arguments that cryptocurrencies are akin to Beanie Babies or baseball cards fell flat before the judge, as did the suggestion that the SEC could take over jurisdiction on ""essentially all investment activity"" if a formal contract isn't needed.  The judge seemed to suggest that any crypto is part of a common enterprise because a token does not exist as an individual product.  ""Unlike in the transaction of commodities or collectibles (including the Beanie Babies discussed during the oral argument…), which may be independently consumed or used, a crypto-asset is necessarily intermingled with its digital network – a network without which no token can exist,"" she wrote.  The judge also looked at the question of whether Coinbase listed securities, finding that the regulator did plausibly allege that with at least two of them, solana (SOL) and chiliz (CHZ), holders could ""reasonably … expect to profit"" from Solana Labs or the Chiliz team's efforts around their respective tokens.  ""The parties do not dispute that, to prevail on its claims, the SEC need only establish that at least one of these 13 Crypto-Assets is being offered and sold as a security, and that Coinbase has intermediated transactions relating therewith, such that transacting in that Crypto-Asset would amount to operating an unregistered exchange, broker or clearing agency,"" the order said.  The case will now move into the discovery phase, with both parties facing an April deadline to work together on a case management plan. Presumably the case will heat up after that, as the parties argue over who gets what and exchange documents.

According to Pompliano’s post, the US government may face a $1.6 trillion annual interest payment by December, should the Federal Reserve persist with its current monetary policies. This projection has ignited speculation among market observers, with suggestions pointing to a scenario that heralded inflation in the US economy. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Spread “Buy The Dip” As BTC Plunges Below $66,000 Notably, Bitcoin is emerging as a focal point in discussions, touted by some as a potential hedge against inflation and a contender for the future standard of currency if the US dollar falters.

I will keep stacking #Bitcoin to hedge against this mess. — Not Larry Fink (@NotLarryFink) April 1, 2024 Insights And Bitcoin’s Varied Perceptions Meanwhile, during a recent feature on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Anthony Pompliano delved into the multifaceted nature of Bitcoin’s role in the financial landscape. He highlighted the varied perceptions of Bitcoin among different market participants, ranging from a “speculative asset” to a “hedge against inflation and store of value.” Pompliano underscored the distinction between investors seeking short-term gains through spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and those adopting Bitcoin as a long-term hedge against inflation. Bitcoin provides hope & protection for anyone. The US dollar has lost 25% of its purchasing power in 4 years, while bitcoin has gained over 800%. We are watching a global store of value be adopted. Here is my full segment on @SquawkCNBC this morning. pic.twitter.com/XvO0B4yE0o — Pomp 🌪 (@APompliano) April 1, 2024 Drawing on global examples, Pompliano elucidated how individuals in different regions, such as Nigeria and Argentina, are leveraging on buying BTC and stablecoins, respectively, reflecting diverse strategies in response to economic circumstances. Pompliano noted: You don’t have to go to emerging market to find out why people want to buy this. If you look at the United States Dollar it has lost 20% of its purchasing power since 2020, Bitcoin is up 800% during that same time period. Bitcoin Recent Performance It is worth noting that despite recent market volatility, characterized by Bitcoin’s notable decline over the past week, Pompliano’s remarks shed light on Bitcoin’s resilience and potential for future growth. Notably, Bitcoin has experienced a significant pullback, losing nearly 10% of its value over the week and further declining by 6% in the past 24 hours alone. Its current market price hovers around $65,234. Market analysts attribute this downturn to diminishing expectations of Federal Reserve interventions and waning demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs, as highlighted in a Bloomberg report.

25147734,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601096,1712106048,"Grayscale Drops Bombshell Report: Crypto Bull Run Progresses To ‘Middle’ Phase, Future Outlook Detailed","The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a significant surge after a prolonged bear market and the intensified crypto winter caused by the collapse of crypto exchanges and firms during 2022 and part of 2023. Notably, Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies have experienced substantial price surges, accompanied by renewed interest from institutional investors entering the market through recently approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Adding to the industry’s positive outlook, asset manager and Bitcoin ETF issuer, Grayscale, believes that the current state of the market indicates that the industry is in the “middle” stages of a crypto bull run. Grayscale recently released a comprehensive report detailing their key findings and insights into what lies ahead. A closer analysis of the report by market expert Miles Deutscher sheds light on the factors contributing to this assessment. Related Reading: Dogecoin Hits Major Roadblock As Whales Go On Massive Selling Spree On-Chain Metrics And Institutional Demand Grayscale’s report starts by highlighting several key signals indicating that the market is currently in the middle of a bull run. These include Bitcoin’s price surpassing its all-time high before the Halving event, the total crypto market cap reaching its previous peak, and the growing attention from traditional finance (TradFi) towards meme coins. To understand how long this rally might sustain, Grayscale emphasizes two specific price drivers: spot Bitcoin ETF inflows and strong on-chain fundamentals. Grayscale notes that nearly $12 billion has flowed into Bitcoin ETFs in just three months, indicating significant “pent-up” retail demand. Moreover, ETF inflows have consistently exceeded BTC issuance, creating upward price pressure due to the demand-supply imbalance. Grayscale’s research focuses on three critical on-chain metrics: stablecoin inflows, decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), and BTC outflows from exchanges. According to Deutscher, the increase in stablecoin supply on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by approximately 6% between February and March suggests enhanced liquidity, making more capital readily available for trading. Furthermore, for the analyst, the doubling of the total value locked into DeFi since 2023 represents growing user engagement, increased liquidity, and improved user experience within the DeFi ecosystem. The outflows from exchanges, which currently account for about 12% of BTC’s circulating supply (the lowest in five years), indicate rising investor confidence in BTC’s value and a preference for holding rather than selling. Based on these catalysts, Grayscale asserts that the market is in the “mid-phase” of the bull run, likening it to the “5th inning” in baseball. Promising Outlook For Crypto Industry Several key metrics support Grayscale’s analysis, including the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio, which indicates that investors who bought BTC at lower prices continue to hold despite rising prices. According to Deutscher, the Market Value Realized Value (MVRV) Z-Score, currently at 3, implies that there is still room for growth in this cycle. Additionally, the ColinTalksCrypto Bitcoin Bull Run Index (CBBI), which integrates multiple ratios, currently stands at 79/100, suggesting that the market is approaching historical cycle peaks with some upward momentum remaining.

Furthermore, retail interest has yet to fully return this cycle, as evidenced by lower cryptocurrency YouTube subscription rates and reduced Google Trends interest for “crypto” compared to the previous cycle. Ultimately, Grayscale retains a “cautiously optimistic” stance regarding the future of this bull cycle, given the promising signals and analysis outlined in their report.

25145811,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=601004,1712102448,Bitcoin Supply In Loss Hits 10% After Crash: What Happened Last Time,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin supply in profit has plunged following the latest crash in the asset’s price towards the $65,000 level. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Is Now Down To Around 90% As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a post on X, around 10% of the BTC supply is now in a state of loss. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the “Percent Supply in Profit,” which tracks the percentage of the total circulating Bitcoin supply holding an unrealized gain. This metric works by going through the blockchain history of each coin in circulation to see the price at which it was last transferred. Assuming that this previous transaction involved a change of hands, the price at its moment would serve as the cost basis for the coin. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Spread “Buy The Dip” As Bitcoin Plunges Below $66,000 The coins with a cost basis that is less than the current spot price of the cryptocurrency would naturally be considered to be holding a profit, and as such, they would be counted under the supply in profit. The Percent Supply in Profit adds up all such coins and calculates what part of the total supply they make up for. The opposite metric, the Percent Supply in Loss, adds up the coins not satisfying this condition. Since the total circulating supply must add up to 100%, the Percent Supply in Loss can be deduced from the Percent Supply in Profit by subtracting its value from 100. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Percent Supply in Profit for Bitcoin over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has taken a plunge in recent days | Source: @jvs_btc on X As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Percent Supply in Profit has seen a sharp drop recently as the cryptocurrency price has gone through a significant drawdown. The indicator’s value has dropped to around the 90% mark, which means that about 10% of the supply is currently carrying a loss. The chart shows that the last time the metric touched these levels was back on 22 March. Interestingly, the asset also found its bottom around then. Earlier, the Percent Supply In Profit had pushed towards the 100% mark, which was a natural consequence of the price setting a new all-time high (ATH), since at fresh highs, all of the supply must be out of the red. Generally, the investors in profit are more likely to sell their coins, so if many come into gains, the possibility of a mass selloff rises. Due to this reason, high levels of the Percent Supply In Profit have often led to tops. Related Reading: Start Selling Bitcoin When This Happens, This Quant Says Similarly, bottoms become more likely when investor profitability levels drop relatively low. The current value of 90% is still quite high, but this isn’t unusual during bull runs, as there is strong demand and ATHs are being explored. The fact that the profitability has cooled off compared to earlier levels may be constructive for the rally’s chances to see a continuation, just like it did last month.
