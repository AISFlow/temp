42425201,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFxh,1386863797,Baidu-owned Hao123 Launches Dedicated Bitcoin News Portal,"There were signs of bitcoin life from Chinese internet giant Baidu this week: Hao123, one of its subsidiaries and China's largest web directory, launched a dedicated bitcoin channel and news aggregator for bitcoin-related stories.  The launch  happened the same day another of Baidu's subsidiaries, Jiasule, announced it would stop, or 'pause', accepting bitcoin payments for its security software.  Jiasule's impact  Jiasule caused an initial stir with its decision to accept bitcoin, leading to headlines suggesting the so-called 'Google of China' was now accepting bitcoin. It was also cited as a reason for bitcoin's recent drop in value, after it announced the suspension.  It should be noted that Hao123 is not actually selling anything, nor accepting bitcoin for payment.  As well as headlines for all the latest bitcoin news, the new site also features a chart with all the latest bitcoin (and even litecoin) exchange rates in Chinese yuan from the leading exchanges.  There is a timeline of major events in the history of the world's first cryptocurrency, starting from ""January 3rd 2009: Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first 50 Bitcoins on a server located in Helsinki, Finland,"" and ending with ""Future: ?""  Alexa ranks  Hao123's traffic 17th globally and 5th in China.  Central bank statements  Baidu's Jiasule Internet security service cited volatility in bitcoin exchange rates and the People's Bank of China's December 5th announcement as reasons for suspending bitcoin payments.  The central bank's statement denied bitcoin's official status as a currency, due to its decentralized and multi-national nature – barring Chinese financial institutions from trading in bitcoins.  Jiangsu Telecom, a subsidiary of China Telecom, also withdrew its bitcoin payment promotion at the same time.  Speculators wondered if the decision had been prompted by orders from government officials, leading to fears the Chinese authorities were about to crack down on bitcoin use. Bitcoin fell from an all-time high of over $1,200 to under $700 just minutes after the news broke.  Redditer 'okahira' pointed out that Hao123 actually added its bitcoin news page at the very same time Jiasule removed their payment option, but the news had been drowned out.  'Ordinary people'  Of course, simply posting news about bitcoin is not the same as accepting it for payment. So far, no major mainland Chinese site has re-introduced bitcoin as a payment option. However, Hao123's actions do indicate a high-level of interest among Chinese internet users.  The central bank's statement also made it clear that ordinary people were free to trade and use bitcoin; the directive applied only to 'financial institutions.'  This means bitcoin in China is now regulated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).  Banker Joseph Wang's explanation on Quora gave a clearer view of the scene; suggesting the statement was no big deal.  Reddit user 'JChief' added that this meant there was now a regulator for bitcoin where previously there had been none, and as such it was prudent for any Baidu or China Telecom subsidiaries to stop accepting bitcoin until they received further advice.  ""It would be idiotic and very much unlike how China works, if they continued to accept bitcoin without guidance from the MIIT,"" he wrote.  At the time of writing, bitcoin's value on BTC China was CNY 5,398.98 ($889.26), down from yesterday's high of CNY 6,059.98 ($998).

42425206,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvG3h,1386859548,Lemon Wallet Acquired by LifeLock for $42.6 Million,"Identity theft protection company LifeLock has acquired Lemon Inc, creator of an innovative digital wallet, for $42.6m.  Lemon Wallet launched in 2012 with the aim of ""delivering the most consumer focused, secure and innovative digital wallet experience on the market"".  The app was initially designed as a backup of a physical wallet, but it went on to develop more and more useful features, with users being able access real time account balances and fraud alerts.  LifeLock launched its own new app today – LifeLock Wallet – which utilizes all of Lemon's technology to aid users in the management and protection of their digital identity.    Exciting news today: @LifeLock acquires @LemonWallet and releases new LifeLock Wallet http://t.co/F8joixYccJ      — LifeLock (@LifeLock) December 12, 2013        Back in August, Wences Casares, founder and CEO of Lemon, said he was looking into supporting bitcoin on Lemon Wallet, but this wasn’t implemented before the sale of Lemon Inc. He told CoinDesk today that the LifeLock Wallet will not integrate bitcoin as it ""is not, and will not be, a transactional product"".  ""It is about keeping your transactional identity handy in your phone and making it secure,"" he added.  Casares, personally, is still a big believer in digital currency, though, reiterating what he said back in August: ""I think bitcoin is going to do for money what TCP/IP did to information. [It is] probably the most revolutionary technology since the Internet itself.”  Speaking about today's acquisition, LifeLock CEO Todd Davis said:  “The acquisition of Lemon dramatically expands our mobile capabilities, enabling us to launch a robust consumer wallet app in the marketplace on day one. The innovation and expertise from a mobile-first company like Lemon gives us powerful new ways to engage with current and future members.”  Lemon Wallet was downloaded more than 3.6m times, enabling users to store a digital copy of the contents of their wallets. This means users could keep a record of their credit card numbers, loyalty card details, ID card information and much more.  “At Lemon, we’ve built our business around digitizing everything in your physical wallet and making it available anywhere and anytime on your smartphone,” said Casares, adding:  “Joining forces with LifeLock makes tremendous strategic sense and provides something completely new in the market: a digital wallet combined with a way to help protect it.""  He said that now that LifeLock's acquisition of Lemon is complete, his role is to run LifeLock's mobile division.  LifeLock was founded in 2005 and has raised $178m in funding, with investors including Goldman Sachs and Symantec, according to Crunchbase.  Lemon received $8m in Series A funding back in June 2012. The company's investors included Maveron, CampVentures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, which was part of a $5m funding round for bitcoin exchange BTC China last month.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/12/lemon-wallet-acquired-by-lifelock-for-426-million,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b021f9206669b42abab53c5e2b087d9132d24ed-989x698.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvG1h,1386856844,Bitcoin Foundation Officially Launches International Chapters,"The Bitcoin Foundation has officially rolled out its internationalization programme, signing national affiliates in Canada and Australia, just as another organization makes plans to promote bitcoin on a global basis.  The Global Bitcoin Alliance, with members across the globe, will take a fundamentally different approach.  The Foundation  is requesting affiliate chapters to pay the Foundation directly for membership, under what executives are calling a 'membership sharing arrangement'.  In contrast, the Global Bitcoin Alliance will be a loose group of regional bitcoin associations, which retain complete autonomy and are not required to share members with a single organization.  The Foundation, which began in the US, marked the initiative by opening its London office. It will be headed by Jon Matonis, executive director of the Bitcoin Foundation and a contributing editor to CoinDesk.  [post-quote]  The Foundation has already signed the Bitcoin Association of Australia and the Bitcoin Embassy in Canada under its international affiliate program. It also has a memoranda of understanding with groups in India and Argentina, and has received ""strong interest"" from China, Germany, and the Netherlands.  It is offering considerable benefits to affiliates who sign up. Namely, reimbursement of the expenses for their paperwork, and the ability to use the Bitcoin Foundation brand.  It will also provide logistical support in areas such as handling press queries, should a local affiliate be unable to deal with a request.  The 15-month old Bitcoin Foundation, which has over a thousand members, has become one of the most powerful organizations in the bitcoin community. Its executives testified at a recent US Senate hearing into the virtual currency.  “We believe that we can achieve bitcoin’s potential and promise if we are just a little more organized in our efforts,” said the Bitcoin Foundation’s director of public affairs Jinyoung Englund, who has been advocating a hands-off approach to affiliates. She added:  “We don’t need to control the future of bitcoin, but we want to facilitate an environment where we can develop a network of local communities.”  How affiliate membership works  The process for becoming an affiliate starts with a memorandum of understanding (MOU).  This lets potential affiliates spend between 30 and 60 days negotiating contract terms and organizing local administrative paperwork, for which they are reimbursed.  This includes picking a name and deciding on a local leadership structure. The Bitcoin Foundation does not control the appointment of board members, although it does request that affiliates have at least five board members.  However, there is at least one area in the Foundation’s template affiliate agreement that has been causing concern with potential affiliates: membership sharing.  A local organization would have to ask its members to pay any membership dues to the Bitcoin Foundation. The Foundation would then pay a proportion of that membership back to the affiliate, based on the proportion of members that they bought to the overall Bitcoin Foundation membership.  If an organization was already charging fees to its own members, then there would have to be a “transition period,” said Englund, who insists that this is negotiable.  “The group that reached out to us reads it, and if they don’t like something then we discuss it,” she said of the template agreement.  Regional pushback  However, the clause seems to be enough of a sticking point for the Foundation that it contributed to the collapse of at least one affiliate negotiation.  By the time the Bitcoin Embassy committed to the affiliate program, the Bitcoin Alliance, another organization representing bitcoiners in Canada with 150 members, had already passed. Alliance leader Anthony Di Iorio had balked at the membership part of the agreement.  “We are glad that we are keeping all of our membership,” he said, adding that he still looked forward to working with both the Bitcoin Embassy and the Bitcoin Foundation.  “We would like to work with anybody. We just feel better taking our membership, and not forcing people to join or combine memberships if they don’t want to.”  Englund argued that membership sharing is a reasonable request, given the benefits that the Foundation brings to the affiliates.  She insisted that the Foundation remains sensitive to local bitcoin groups’ needs, and does not want to control their memberships under the affiliate agreement.  “I’d quote Bill Cosby. The fastest road to failure is trying to please everybody,” she said. “We’re not trying to pre-emptively stop anyone from building their own initiatives or trying to start their own memberships.”  She cited the bitcoin grant and sponsorship programs as prime examples. “We support people who aren’t members, who are not doing things that are on our agenda.”  Nevertheless, others also expressed concerns over the affiliate agreement this week. “We believe it is not between equals. The central Bitcoin Foundation [has] much more rights compared to the affiliates,” said Mats Henricson, organizer of the Stockholm bitcoin meetup, and a main contributor to the Java Bitcoin API – citing personal views which he said were in line with those of his peers in Sweden. Henricson said:  “We also believe too much money ends up in the US. We have objections to the proposed split of money, where large affiliates would get more % of the money [sic] compared to small affiliates.”  He plans to create an independent association alongside his colleagues, he added.  “If Bitcoin Foundation is serious about this, then they should start by creating a US affiliate, and make a proper split with the central foundation,” he continued.  The US part of the Foundation’s membership is in the process of becoming a subsidiary, which is a larger organization with “more responsibility” than an affiliate, said Englund.  Subsidiaries will sit underneath the international Bitcoin Foundation, just as affiliates do. There are no concrete plans to create other subsidiaries at this time, and the US subsdiary will retain all of its membership fees.  The Global Bitcoin Alliance  Key members of the Israeli bitcoin community have also reconsidered their relationship with the Foundation, postponing joining the Bitcoin Foundation indefinitely due to what insiders call “several disagreements with them”.  “We currently prefer to adopt a bottom-down grassroots approach,” said Ron Gross, founder of Israeli bitcoin startup BitBlu.  “Each country elects their representative organizations, and these organizations form a loosely-coupled global organization.”  Gross is said to be a key driver behind this loosely-coupled collection of organisations, named the Global Bitcoin Alliance.  Gross is also the executive director of the Mastercoin Foundation, which is an effort to promote a new protocol layer designed to run on top of bitcoin, adding new features to it. Mastercoin is also designed so that it could migrate away from the bitcoin block chain in the future.  The Global Bitcoin Alliance was conceived in September at Amsterdam’s Bitcoin Europe conference, when various groups met to discuss the Bitcoin Foundation’s internationalization proposals, says Di Iorio, who is also involved in the initiative.  Currently, it consists of a Google Group mailing list, with several participating groups from around the world. It will differ from the Foundation's approach in that it will be flat, non-hierarchical and entirely decentralized, he argued. Di Iorio said:  “It will share resources and help to expedite the growth of communities worldwide, without tying ourselves down to each other. It’s very loose fitting. In no way do we believe that we should be decentralized in one organization in different countries. It’s a collaborative, independent organization.”  Although the Alliance hasn’t officially launched, it has retained a marketing organization, and should be sending out a press release soon, said Di Iorio.  Some are happy about membership sharing  Some are happy with the proposed membership agreement, however.  Bitcoin Argentina  , which has signed an MOU with the Foundation, sees it positively. The organization brings 150 “collaborators” and hundreds of additional supporters to the Foundation, said co-founder Rodolfo Andragnes, adding that the organization had already planned to begin asking for some paid memberships.  The Foundation has proven open to negotiations on a per-country basis, said Andragnes, adding that Bitcoin Argentina is also hoping to expand to form eight new foundations in Spanish-speaking countries within South America.  “We expect that our supporters also understand the need of supporting a global Foundation with their payment to us,” he said.  Lars Holdgaard, co-organiser of Dansk Bitcoinforening (the Danish Bitcoin Foundation), was also generally positive about the Bitcoin Foundation’s proposal.  “We're definitely positive. It's a fair and good affiliate contract, but of course there are points we have to discuss and agree upon,” he said.  Dansk Bitcoinforening hadn’t agreed on the membership sharing position, he admitted, under which the Bitcoin Foundation has asked for 50% of their membership fees. “But we're positive towards that as well, because they bring good things to the table.”  The Bitcoin Foundation’s membership is charged in bitcoin prices (from the Coindesk Bitcoin Price Index) that fluctuate regularly to reflect the price of the virtual currency. There is no free membership option for the Foundation.

42425204,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvG5h,1386853944,BTC China Reports 10x Volume Increase From $5 Million to $50 Million at Inside Bitcoins,"It was representatives from BTC China who stole the show at day two of the Inside Bitcoins conference in Las Vegas, Nevada.  The day started out with ‘A Practical Guide to Bitcoin Compliance and Regulation’ hosted by Bill Haraf, Managing Director of Promontory Financial Group and Adam Shapiro, the Group's Director.  The two were both in agreement that consumer compliance would be big in 2014.  Following this, Steve Beauregard, CEO & Founder of GoCoin, talked about existing value systems that bear similarities to virtual currencies – like the ‘token economy’ that exists in credit card rewards. “You have loyalty points, other things in the ‘token’ economy,” he explained.  Interestingly enough, Beauregard pointed to gifts and donations as the biggest payment methods of virtual currencies like bitcoin.  Beauregard also discussed the decision to base his GoCoin exchange in Singapore, where regulations are being tailored to foster innovation. “The government down there has been quite perceptive,” he said.  The highlight of the day was a session focused on bitcoin's influence in China. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China and Malcom CasSelle of Timeline Labs had a number of interesting things to say on the subject.  “Trading volume has risen from $5m to $50m,” Lee said about BTC China's trading platform. Both Lee and CasSelle expect this growth to continue. CasSelle disclosed:  “We’re transacting 150,000 BTC per day.”  Lee guided the audience through the specific regulatory advice that was offered by China this past week.  “Bitcoin is not a currency, and will not be regulated as a currency,” said Lee. CasSelle added that banking is not the main problem for BTC China going forward. He said:  “BTC China as a business will not have problems with deposits and withdrawals [from banks].”  Rather, the issues that BTC China will face relate specifically to making payments in bitcoin, at least in the near future.  “Goods and services cannot be paid for by bitcoin,” said Lee.  This is the likely reason why an alleged BTC China Deal with Chinese Retail Giant Suning did not come to fruition.  The regulatory issues surrounding bitcoin continued to be a major topic at many of the conference's talks.  John Bates, Founder of MindArk and Michael Bombace, Identity Management and Alternative Payments for Booz Allen Hamilton, held a talk titled: ‘Virtual Currency Guidance: Blaze the Trail or Get Run Over’.  The pair made it clear that regulators don’t like to be confronted with something they don’t fully understand. Bitcoin represents a new way of thinking that they have to now consider.  “Regulators hate to be surprised,” said Bates, “And so does law enforcement,” added Bombace.  The final item on the conference agenda was: ‘Moving Bitcoin Forward: Bringing Trust, Legitimacy and Transparency to the Market’.  It featured; Andreas M. Antonopoulos, founder of RootEleven; Eric Benz, VP of Business Development for ZipZap Inc; Robert Cho, VP of SecondMarket; Adam Ettinger, Partner at Strategic Counsel Corp; Izzy Klein, Principal of Podesta Group; and Ardon Lukasiewicz, Founder of Bitmarkers and the session's moderator.  The discussion served as a look towards what might happen for 2014. All the panelists agreed that Bitcoin regulation will likely have more clarity next year.  “Regulators will wrap their heads around this for the US in Q1 or Q2,” said Robert Cho from SecondMarket.  Given the number of scams involving bitcoin, regulators are scrambling to figure out how to best write policy. “Bitcoin is known for complex scam tactics,” said Ardon Lukasiewicz.  Mediabistro will be taking its Inside Bitcoins conference on the road over the next year.

42425209,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvGBh,1386849646,Bitcoin Law: Compliance and Avoidance Strategies,"Marco Santori is a blockchain and bitcoin specialist who leads the FinTech practice at law firm Cooley LLP.  In this multi-part series, Santori gives a basic primer on the state of US law as it applies to digital currency entrepreneurs.      In the first two parts of the series, we covered the law of money transmission on the federal and state-level in the United States. We learned that not all digital currency businesses need to register or obtain a license, but for those that do, the process can prove expensive and time-consuming.  So, how can a business effectively comply with the registration and licensing requirements? What alternatives exist? How can a business avoid them altogether?  You can seek licenses, but it’s expensive  The first and most obvious option for complying with state and federal requirements is to register with FinCEN and seek licenses from each of the states in which your customers reside.  Registration with FinCEN is a fairly simple exercise: 15 minutes and a few mouse clicks on FinCEN’s website will satisfy that obligation. The real burden here comes from the ongoing costs of compliance, like verifying customer information and filing Suspicious Activity Reports.  Likewise, compliance on the state level is expensive.  The up-front costs alone of obtaining 48 state money transmission licenses can exceed six-figures for some applicants. On top of that, satisfying the ongoing state requirements is a business unto itself.  For more information on federal compliance, see part one of this series. For compliance on the State level, see part two. If that process is not appetizing to you, you’re not alone. Many businesses have sought to avoid US customers altogether.  You can avoid US customers, but it takes work  Plenty of businesses, some of my own clients included, have decided that the US market just isn’t for them.  They’ve either soured on the idea of servicing US clients altogether, or have decided to launch and wait it out in jurisdictions like Canada until the US sees regulatory reform.  This can be both profitable and practical, but simply incorporating the overseas market isn’t going to cut it.  The smart business will develop a set of policies and procedures reasonably calculated to keep US residents out. A competent attorney can help guide you through this process, and I can give some very basic principles here.  Firstly, a pre-emptive response to a question I get asked weekly: geofiltering incoming IP addresses is only the beginning. The business itself should detect the jurisdiction of the customer’s IP address, display that address, and ask the customer to confirm that this is his or her jurisdiction.  Both customer and business can take affirmative steps: the customer can be required to click a button stating “I affirm that I am a resident of *country*,” and the business can require verifying documentation, like a passport or utility bill.  Several providers offer these kinds of onboarding services. Your business should develop a risk profile for each of its customers in real time setting forth the probability that the customer is a US resident.  The risk profile should take into account different factors like: (i) whether the customer registers a US bank account with your business, (ii) how many transfers to US bank accounts the customer requests (if you offer such a service), and (iii) how many times the customer accesses your service from within the US after setting up a new account.  [post-quote]  A customer whose activities, over time, start to resemble those of a US resident, might be a US resident – and your business should consider closing that customer’s account.  Once these policies are in place, your business should implement them and record the results in case of future enforcement by a US regulatory body.  The record shouldn't just show that your business followed its own policies, but that those policies worked. If push comes to shove, a judge and jury would probably like to see that, every once in a while, your procedures actually caught a US resident trying to use your service, and that you closed his or her account.  Finally, it should go without saying that your business should not advertise to US customers. This all might seem excessive for, or inapplicable to, your business and indeed it might be. The proper set of procedures will depend heavily upon the details of your business model and your degree of risk tolerance.  For some, even crafting and implementing these policies may be just as unappetising as compliance. There is, in fact, a way to service US customers and avoid these burdens.  Namely, you can become the agent of a Bank or Credit Union, as existing MSB Certified agents of banks, credit unions and money services businesses are typically exempt from registration and licensure requirements.  Functionally, becoming an agent means hiring an attorney to negotiate and execute an agreement with the bank, credit union or MSB (called the “principal”) setting forth your relative rights and obligations.  Becoming an agent implies two important consequences. First, you will lose some control over your business. As the agent, you will act at the principal’s direction. The principal will likely possess more leverage in the negotiation of the agreement and its performance.  Second, you will not avoid the compliance requirements altogether. To be sure, your business won’t need to seek out state licenses or to register with FinCEN, but it will still have to comply with any anti-money laundering and know your customer (KYC) requirements put in place by the principal.  Furthermore, your business will need to implement those requirements in the way the principal wants them implemented – which may or may not map onto your business plan.  For a digital currency business, an agency relationship might be difficult to find.  Existing money transmitter license holders are wary of alienating their current agents by signing on an untested and exotic digital currency business.  Worse, banks and credit unions have yet to develop a compliance program properly tailored to digital currency technology. If no existing licensee is interested, or the ongoing costs of compliance are still too high, not all is lost.  Your business model can fit into an exception, or avoid the MSB rules entirely  There are several exceptions to the MSB registration requirements. The most popular – at least in my experience – are the so-called “payment processor” exemptions.  Businesses that merely perform payment processing services for a merchant are exempt from registration with FinCEN, even though they otherwise fit the definition of a money transmitter. These businesses can thrive in the digital currency ecosystem without ever having to verify their customer’s identifying information or file a Suspicious Activity Report.  The answer to the question: “Am I a payment processor?” is not always obvious, and even then, not all business owners necessarily want to know the answer for sure. After all, the answer might be “no”.  To the attorney’s lament, many clients would prefer to beg forgiveness rather than ask permission. For those who value peace of mind, though, the best way to find out is for your attorney to prepare a “request for ruling” to FinCEN and ask them directly.  I talked about this process in the context of state regulatory bodies in part two, but the same is true for the federal regulators at FinCEN.  Sometimes better than fitting into an exception, some digital businesses have found success in avoiding the money transmission regime entirely. They accomplish this by carefully structuring their business model to avoid the common characteristics of money transmission.  The real-world permutations here are literally infinite, but two simplistic examples might be helpful.  Firstly, a business that would otherwise be a payment processor, but also offers hosted wallet functionality, might offload that responsibility to a third party, or require the customer to provide his own wallet address.  Secondly, an institutional bitcoin miner might, instead of selling his mined bitcoins for dollars, sell his hashing power in bulk to customers who can either hold their mined coins or sell them for dollars themselves.  Another very specific example of adjusting a business model to comply with regulation is a time-tested practice: pass the buck to someone else.  You can white label your product  You’ve probably heard of white labeling. It means developing your product to completion and bringing it to the cusp of launch, but instead of dealing with the regulation required to use it, selling it or licensing it to someone else.  This has the effect of passing the regulatory burden onto the customer and can be successful whether your product is hardware or software. For example, the manufacturer of a Bitcoin ATM machine need not operate it. The manufacturer can successfully sell machines to a third party who will plug it in, collect the cash and deal with the regulatory worries.  The same is true for developers of Bitcoin exchange software. Developers can always operate the exchange in-house under its own brand and manage the regulatory risk.  Alternatively, it can license the exchange Software As A Service (you’ve probably heard the expression “SAAS”) to a third party in a jurisdiction with less stringent regulatory requirements. A competent attorney can guide your business through this process, and prepare the contracts required to get the job done correctly.  This completes the Bitcoin money transmission trilogy.  In part one, we learned about the federal requirements for money transmitters. In part two, we discussed how state money transmission laws could make or break a digital currency business. In this article, part three, we canvassed some strategies for complying with and avoiding those requirements.  What would you like to see in Part 4?

42425190,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFbh,1386846054,Coinbase Raises $25 Million in Bitcoin's Biggest Ever Funding Deal,"Coinbase has managed to secure $25m in series B funding led by Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. This brings the total amount raised by the company to $31.9m.  The firm, which describes itself as an ""international digital wallet that allows you to securely buy, use, and accept bitcoin currency"", is going from strength to strength, with an estimated 600,000 people now using its wallet service, up from 200,000 in August.  The $31.9m raised so far represents the biggest fundraising success of any bitcoin company, dwarfing Circle’s $9m of Series A funding from multiple tech investors. To say that this is huge is not an overstatement.  Coinbase  is getting a lot of positive press, too. Last week it was named the second most exciting tech start-up by Time magazine.  “This funding solidifies our position as the largest and fastest growing bitcoin service in the US. We plan to use the funds to expand our team, continue to educate the market, and promote the mainstream adoption of bitcoin,” Coinbase said in a statement, adding:  “We’ll also expand our referral program, where you can give and get $5 in bitcoin for free when you refer a friend who buys or sells at least $100 of bitcoin.”  Coinbase also announced that Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen has joined the company in an advisory role. Andresen said Coinbase has already become a “critical piece of the Bitcoin infrastructure” in the United States. He added that the best part of his job as chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation is interacting with brilliant people at Coinbase and other start-ups who are working to bring bitcoin to a wider audience.  “We're very excited about the investment. The team at Andreessen is very far up on the curve on their thinking on bitcoin, especially as a way to bring simple economics in to the web in a low level way,” Coinbase co-founder Fred Ehrsam told CoinDesk. “The money will allow us to continue building a world class engineering team, to continue to play offense when it comes to regulation and compliance, and to throw fuel on the fire for our referral program.”  Ehrsam said it is all about continuing to build a user experience that continues to reduce any friction in bitcoin - whether by making it easier to buy bitcoin with more pay-in options, getting more world-class merchants on board to what is the most seamless checkout experience in bitcoin, or adding to the Coinbase API, which is currently the most active developer platform in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Coinbase likes to point out that it is the only company in the bitcoin ecosystem that encompasses both consumers, merchants and developers.  “We are averaging 10,000 new customer sign-ups a day, and are now working with over 16,000 merchants including OkCupid, Khan Academy, and reddit, who use Coinbase to accept bitcoin,” said Coinbase.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/12/coinbase-raises-25-million-in-bitcoins-biggest-ever-funding-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2d2b62006bb4c2ed8cc1881ab80e53462e180b6-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425192,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFhh,1386842431,What Do Australia's Biggest Banks Think About Bitcoin?,"Much like their counterparts in Europe and North America, banks in Australia have had mixed reactions to bitcoin.  While some financial institutions are working together with bitcoin businesses to understand the issues at hand, others have given conflicting messages, and at least one is ridding itself of bitcoin customers altogether.  Banks’ willingness to work with entrepreneurs in the bitcoin world is vital to building a healthy and stable bitcoin ecosystem.  Exchanges, ATMs, payment processors and even some face-to-face traders all need to move vast amounts of money through traditional financial networks, as they bridge the present gap between the fiat and cryptocurrency systems.  Banking reactions to bitcoin around the world have so far fallen into one of these categories:  1) Curiosity and a willingness to learn more.  2) Ignorance.  3) Suspicion of criminal activity and/or a threat to the banking industry’s business model.  There may also be opposing views within the banks, just as there are differing views on the banking industry among those involved with bitcoin.  Australia's banking industry is dominated by the 'Big Four' banking groups: the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), National Australia Bank (NAB), the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), and Westpac.  While there are other smaller players, anyone engaging in commerce in Australia is bound to encounter one of the Big Four at some stage.  Commonwealth Bank: avoiding bitcoin  Melbourne-based exchange CoinJar, which recently secured half a million US dollars in venture funding, was the highest-profile Australian company to feel their bank’s wrath so far. Back in August, the Commonwealth Bank froze transactions to and from CoinJar’s account.  In an additional move that sent chills through the entrepreneurial community, the bank also closed down the personal accounts of co-founders Asher Tan and Ryan Zhou without notification.  Though CoinJar has rebounded and gathered strength since, both actions by the bank harmed its daily operations as it tried to transact in dollars with customers, dealt with confusing explanations from the bank, and sought to defend its own reputation.  In addition, the Commonwealth Bank is said to have blacklisted Bitstamp, one of the world’s largest exchanges, and blocked payments to and from the company.  Customer Ian MacKay said he had used his CBA account to transfer to Bitstamp without issue in June 2013, but received a text message in November to contact the bank after attempting to send AU$10,000. He said:  “I was informed that they had blocked all transfers for all customers to that payment address. They promptly reversed it without charge.”  “When questioned they stated they were ‘not allowed’ to say anything more than that. I expressed polite dismay that CBA should choose the path of censorship when Bitstamp is clearly 100% above board and, as far as I know, Australia has basically said they will treat BTC like cash.”  MacKay then convinced the customer service representative to look into bitcoin for himself on “non-bank time.”  National Australia Bank: bitcoin friendly  In a twist of fate, a representative from another ‘Big Four’ bank, the National Australia Bank, approached Tan at a startup event and offered to help out.  CoinJar has spoken highly of NAB’s attitude to bitcoin and startup businesses in general, and have publicly recommended them to other entrepreneurs.  ANZ Bank: Mixed  But what of the other two major banks? ANZ appears mixed on the issue, with some customers receiving account closure notices and others (so far) receiving assistance combating fraud.  Chris Cameron, a doctor who trades on LocalBitcoins in his spare time, claims the ANZ bank is moving to close down his account and others. Chatting to fellow traders on LocalBitcoins, he discovered others have received notices advising them their accounts will be closed in January 2014.  Having previously had his Commonwealth Bank account closed around the same time as CoinJar’s, Cameron was dismayed at ANZ’s decision to follow suit:  “This is despite having an amazing credit rating and I am actually classified as a premium client of theirs,” he said.  “Therefore it seems that NAB is the only bank left in Australia with a favorable approach to bitcoins. Just thought I would let you know… now it seems that ANZ has also joined the anti-BTC.”  Another LocalBitcoins trader, Trent Churchill, told a different story. He had heard of three other ANZ customers involved with trading whose bank accounts had been compromised. This was ""most likely due to poor security on the customers’ part,"" and involved the theft of LocalBitcoins-related details.  Following this, Churchill personally experienced a number of attempts at fraudulent transactions by a user armed with the same previously-safe account details.  After one transaction had not cleared over a weekend, he contacted ANZ and was told a bank representative had been trying to get in touch with him. Upon reaching the appropriate department, he had the following exchange:  “‘So you trade bitcoins, do you?’ she asked. ‘Yes’ I replied. ‘Well I'm here to make that safer and more efficient’ she said. ‘We have many bitcoin-trading customers and some of them are very notable clients. We wish to work with them and help them trade safely.’ She then proceeded to tell me she was the lead fraud investigator of the ANZ Falcon Fraud Prevention Team and that I was not in any trouble. ‘In fact I'm now your personal fraud prevention officer,’ she said, and gave me details on how to contact her directly during business hours, and the fraud team after hours.”  “I was amazed at this bank’s attitude and helpful nature towards bitcoin,” Churchill added. “Very refreshing. I was able to point out that the local bitcoins account [in question] also had an ad for selling bitcoins for cash, and a street address had been left on the ad. I hope they nailed him.”  Joshua Ballard, who operates the online store Bit-Cash, spoke highly of ANZ, claiming the bank had actively helped him identify fraud.  “They are amazing in regards to my business. I have regular help and support with them, and a good dialogue with their fraud division who actively help me spot fraud in the making (when someone pays me with a hacked bank account for bitcoin). They have even spotted my losses a few times when the fraud has snuck through. Their main goal is to help me with my business, it seems.”  “ANZ has not officially stated anything about bitcoin, but by their actions and supportive frameworks i think that they are not anti-bitcoin, as they know well what I am doing. They are even happy about me starting with Litecoin.”  Westpac  There are fewer reports about the other ‘Big-Four’ bank, Westpac. Trent Churchill claimed he made a personal visit to a branch to talk with a manager about bank policy on digital currencies, but the manager seemed confused and had never heard anything about “Bit-o-coin.”  Building a Bitcoin Payment Infrastructure in Australia  Stephen Rowlison is the CTO of Diamond Circle Pty Ltd, which is attempting to introduce a bitcoin ATM and point-of-sale payment network featuring bitcoin transfer via near-field communication (NFC) tags to Australia.  Given bitcoin’s high value of late, Diamond Circle also wants to incorporate credit/debit card payment options into its machines, but Rowlison admits it has presented a “significant challenge” so far.  Building these extra functions into the ATMs has also brought the company into contact with the Australian Payments Clearing Association (APCA), a self-regulatory body which counts all major financial institutions among its members.  APCA has said little about bitcoin but mentions under 'Future of Payments' on its website: “New digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, may [...] reshape the payments landscape.”  While he has heard several other tales of Australian account shutdowns, Rowlison says he’s more concerned with the big players in the credit card industry.  “My issue presently is whether Visa and Mastercard will approve us to issue bitcoins from our ATM and merchant point-of-sale equipment. This is going to be a global decision.”  Failing these companies’ approval, bitcoin ATM users will find themselves feeding large quantities of paper (or in Australia’s case, polymer plastic) banknotes into the machine to get their bitcoins.  As long as some of their banks don’t find out what disruptive things they’re doing with that cash, it seems.  CoinDesk contacted a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson and ANZ Media Relations for comments, but had not received any responses at the time of writing.
