42381793,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9paiB,1556314503,"Bitfinex Needs ‘A Few Weeks’ to Unfreeze Funds, CFO Tells Shareholder","Two Bitfinex shareholders said they were unconcerned by the New York Attorney General's allegations that the cryptocurrency exchange lost $850 million of client and corporate funds.  Zhao Dong, a Bitfinex shareholder who has tried to reassure the crypto community that the exchange is solvent and operational numerous times in the past, told CoinDesk Friday that he remains ""supportive"" of both Bitfinex and Tether, the stablecoin issuer with overlapping management and ownership.  Giancarlo Devasini, Bitfinex's chief financial officer, personally assured Zhao that this is a temporary situation, Zhao said. Indeed, Devasini told him that the exchange ""need[s] a few weeks and the funds will be unfrozen.""  ""The funds were in several banks in Poland, [the] U.S. and Portugal, so I'm not sure but that's what I heard,"" Zhao said.  While the New York Attorney General's office says the missing funds belong to both Bitfinex's corporate accounts as well as its customers, Zhao said the funds belonged entirely to customers, saying:  ""What the information I have right now is there are no losses, but the funds belong to clients. If the U.S. government seized the funds, they should know, the funds doesn’t belong to Bitfinex or Tether, it’s the clients’ money.""  'I trust them'  Zhao spoke a day after the New York Attorney General revealed a court order asking the exchange to preserve and turn over all documentation about the matter, as well as documents outlining how Bitfinex borrowed funds from its sister firm Tether (both are operated by iFinex).  According to the NYAG's investigative findings, Bitfinex could not access $850 million held by Panama-based Crypto Capital, and had borrowed $700 million from Tether's reserves to cover up the shortfall. The news sparked a sell-off in the broader crypto market and a significant shift to alternative stablecoins over the next several hours, indicating trader concern about the two long-controversial companies.  However, when asked if he was concerned about allegations that Bitfinex hid the loss of $850 million, Zhao said he was not.  He cited events from his six years trading on the exchange as the reason for his confidence. ""They did very well [after previous calamities] so I trust them,"" Zhao said, referring to a hack in 2016 and the freezing of its funds by Wells Fargo in 2017.  Tether vs. banking  Zhao also argued that Tether's model is safer than fractional reserve banking.  ""Tell me, which bank is 100 percent reserved? Not even Tether is ... fully reserved, [but] it’s much, much better than other banks,"" he said. ""Most banks only have 2-3 percent of reserves, for Tether even the $800 million [that] is lost, even that is [not all of their funds], they have 70 percent reserved.""  Pressed on the amount Tether has in reserves, Zhao added that he believes the company is 100 percent backed, ""but even if they're not, they're much better than the banks.""  (It should be noted that banks in the U.S. have Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance, covering customers' funds up to $250,000 each in the event of a bank failure. More than 140 other countries have similar arrangements, according to the International Association of Deposit Insurers.)  'They're still here'  Nor is Zhao alone. Tian Jia, another shareholder, told CoinDesk Friday that he maintains his support for Bitfinex, and that he's heard from all of its executives since the news broke late Thursday.  ""They're still there, they're trying to solve problems,"" he said. (CoinDesk has not received responses to multiple requests for comment from Bitfinex and Tether on the situation.)  That being said, Tian said he did not have any information that Bitfinex has not already made public, such as Bitfinex's claim in a statement Thursday night that it plans to recover the funds. Unlike Zhao, Tian did not have a timeline for this recovery process.  Tian concluded:  ""Because it is customers’ money, it’s not stolen cryptocurrency, it’s fiat. It can’t be stolen. It’s only frozen by the [regulators], and [Bitfinex is] trying to get it back by approaching Panama and the [U.S. Attorney General]. They have been communicating all along.""

42381803,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9panD,1556310151,'Darkest Days Yet': 'Purple Pill' Tell-All Details Years-Long Rift at Heart of MakerDAO Stablecoin Project,"""Currently, the Maker development team is going through its most difficult challenge that I have witnessed during my 3.5 years with the project.""  So begins a document obtained by CoinDesk, entitled ""Zandy's Story,"" dated April 3, 2019. It tells nearly the complete history of MakerDAO, an ethereum-based project best known for creating the stablecoin DAI, from the perspective of one of its earliest supporters.  The 24-page document also clarifies the conflict at the heart of the so-called ""Purple Pill Discussions"" – a Signal chat group reported by CoinDesk on April 25 that appears to be causing a contentious rift at the top ranks of one of ethereum’s hottest decentralized startups.  In short, ""Zandy's Story"" details how two separate but distinct organizations built the tools that power the cryptocurrencies MKR and DAI. Yet the divergent views of these two organizations were bound to reach a breaking point, the document makes clear.  Who is Zandy?  ""Zandy"" is the online handle of Andy Milenius, who, until recently, was the chief technology officer of MakerDAO. The document was obtained via a third party, however, Milenius has since confirmed to CoinDesk he is no longer the CTO and that the document is authentic.  Over the course of more than 10,000 words, ""Zandy's Story"" tells the tale of how he became enamored with the possibilities of ethereum in 2015 and found his way to MakerDAO and its CEO, Rune Christensen. The story articulates why a stable cryptocurrency was an essential component of any smart-contract ecosystem.  It ends with a cadre of early supporters, Maker staff and Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation board members trying to find a way to keep the two disparate parts of the project together. It's this middle-way effort that is referred to as the ""Purple Pill"" group.  In early 2019, Christensen had presented everyone with a so-called red pill and blue pill, the document says.  The ""red pill"" was following Christensen's lead: ""The main focus was on government compliance and integration of Maker into the existing global financial system.""  The ""blue pill"" was for those who did not want such a formal organizational structure. These parties would be allowed to work on the Multi-Collateral Dai (MCD) project until it was finished. Then their funding would be discontinued.  From Milenius's perspective, this blue pill contingent was mainly the team led by Nikolai Mushegian, CEO of DappHub and Christensen's original technical partner on the project. However, this faction was not solely members of the development team. Ashleigh Schap, from MakerDAO's business side, is also cited in the document as someone who shared concerns about MakerDAO's direction.  A report by The Block noted that Schap had also recently left the organization. Schap could not be reached for comment.  The document explains the origin of the name this way:  ""A Signal chat group was created to discuss this topic, the name Purple Pill was chosen because the hope was that there was a third way available to break up this binary choice.""  These discussions, as was made clear in a leaked legal letter from a group of board members who were allegedly pushed out, were not something Christensen was open to. ""Zandy's Story"" corroborates as much.  ""There was only one way he could interpret it: conspiracy,"" Milenius wrote of Christensen, adding:  ""The board was summoned for a meeting and the offending members were fired. It gave him no joy, but it had to be done.""  Subtle spin-offs  The MakerDAO story is one of company sub-units spinning off to solve immediate problems with long-term ramifications.  In its earliest days, the company now know as DappHub spun off from MakerDAO because Christensen and Mushegian couldn't get along, according to Milenius' account.  In 2016, with tension building, he writes, ""Rune suggested that Nikolai form his own company as a way to keep their relationship separated and hopefully professional. From that day on DappHub has forever remained a place for misfits and weirdo genius Maker contributors that Rune can’t quite understand.""  This tension would remain in MakerDAO from then on. ""Zandy's Story"" says there was always a contingent pushing for a more traditional corporate structure and another that wanted to invent a new kind of organization.  Shortly after Mushegian broke off, the MKR token was launched, giving the company a development fund, a pool of tokens that could be sold in order to pay for work on the project. A second spin-off would result when this fund morphed into the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation at the end of 2018.  At that time, the Milenius account says: ""[Christensen] presented a document that outlined the core principles of the Foundation and how it would work in general. He chose the most morally upright early contributors to be board members to ensure that everyone would be satisfied, even those who were skeptical of him.""  The foundation was established by the end of the year, reportedly with nine board members, five of which we named in previous CoinDesk reporting for the first time. Those board members, according to the Zandy account, were removed following the revelation of the ""Purple Pill Discussions.""  Ruling tensions  ""The project has always been led by Rune in one way or another,"" Milenius admits late in his story.  Through the latter half of 2016, Christensen had actually distanced himself from the project to see if it could run on its own, Milenius reports. Then Polychain, the venture capital firm, announced its first fundraising round, and Christensen returned to help negotiate a sale of MKR to the pioneering token investment firm.  Negotiating the deal caused Christensen to realize that ""he needed to step up and take responsibility for his creation,"" Milenius writes.  The formation of the Maker Ecosystem Growth Foundation appears to have cemented that authority, as shown when Christensen demonstrated he could remove recalcitrant board members at will.  ""He refused to put the project at legal risk by engaging in open dialogue,"" Milenius writes, adding additional context with the following:  ""[Christensen] revealed that he thought 'this wasn’t ever supposed to be a real board' that actually provided oversight of his actions because 'if he had wanted a real board he would have hired actual executives, not IT guys who were early to the project.'""  Concurrently, Mushegian, still a major token holder, attempted to bring the issues before MKR holders, as he recounted in an April 7 blog post.  ""I seem to be the only one with full visibility (now removed) who is not under a draconian NDA,"" he wrote.  A MakerDAO spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment as of press time.  ""Zandy's Story"" was written as a plea for Christensen to correct course, but in a post in the MakerDAO chat forums on Thursday, Milenius referenced CoinDesk's prior reporting on the conflict, writing the following:  ""For better or worse, the controversy that is described in the published legal letter was settled earlier this month.""  Milenius later communicated that he used the word ""settled"" in the colloquial, not legal, sense of the word.  Christine Kim contributed additional reporting.

42381791,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9paff,1556301623,Funding Approved for Audit of Ethereum's ProgPoW Mining Proposal,"Ethereum developers announced today that funding has been approved to audit the hotly-contested code change known as Programmatic Proof-of-Work or ProgPoW.  Since February, developers have been gathering the funds necessary to back a third-party audit of the ProgPoW code. Today, during a weekly meeting, it was announced that the targeted amount of 50,000 DAI (equivalent to roughly $50,000) has been fully met through crowd-sourced donations on open-source bounty platform Gitcoin, as well as other unnamed sources from the community.  The aim of this audit, as stated by Ethereum Foundation community relations manager Hudson Jameson in a past blog post is to examine “the expected effect of ProgPoW on the security of ethereum,” as well as on ethereum’s mining landscape as a whole.  The proposed code change would essentially make it more difficult for specialized hardware to mine on ethereum, which would effectively box out the ecosystem's graphics card (GPU)-based industry. Estimates show that mining rewards gained on the the $16 billion dollar blockchain presently are about $700 million annually.  With ProgPow activated on the ethereum network, the efficiency gains of an ethereum miner using an ASIC machine versus a comparatively lower-cost, general purpose computer also called a GPU would be much smaller and result in more equal competition for mining rewards on the network.  Kristy-Leigh Minehan – one of the developers behind ProgPoW – explained to CoinDesk in a former interview:  “ProgPoW is a dynamically changing algorithm that is tuned for today's GPUs...The compute vs memory intensity is tuned to match current consumer GPUs, which minimizes any gains from a specialized ASIC.”  Jameson noted on today’s bi-weekly ethereum developer call that the ProgPoW audit should begin next week and potentially be completed sometime in July of this year.  “The ProgPow audit is going to be funded,” said Jameson. “Everyone has confirmed their funding. It should be started this week or next week hopefully. There’s just some logistics to work out, meaning people have to sign some paperwork and the funds have to be sent.”  The third-party auditor that will be contracted for the ProgPoW audit is a Berlin-based computer security firm called Least Authority.  Back in January, Least Authority was announced to have been hired by the Electric Coin Company – which is developer team building the privacy coin zcash – for three separate security audit reports.  Correction (May 15, 2020, 18:44 UTC): ProgPoW stands for programmatic proof-of-work, not progressive proof-of-work, as was previously listed in this article.

42381790,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9paeP,1556295306,$10 Million in Paxos Stablecoins Printed Overnight Following Tether Allegations,"More than 10 million Paxos Standard stablecoins were minted in the 18 hours after the New York Attorney General's bombshell allegations about rival issuer Tether.  Chad Cascarilla, CEO of Paxos, which issues the Paxos Standard token, said the company saw a surge in demand overnight.  ""There was a lot of minting that happened yesterday throughout the day and overnight as well,"" Cascarilla told CoinDesk Friday morning. ""I think that's definitely a function of the news because PAX started trading at a very significant premium to Tether and the dollar.""  He attributed this behavior to increased demand for his firm's stablecoin, adding:  ""We don't pre-mint PAX, so the PAX [volume] is going up or down based on market demand for Paxos dollars … so that increase is definitely related to market demand and I have to assume it's because of the Tether news.""  Specifically, 13,737,199.87 new PAX were created and 3,354,741.74 were redeemed, for a net increase of 10 million, according to blockchain data. Most of the new issuance (13,158,288.4) was minted after the Tether news came out around 17:00 UTC, in these four transactions.  Another regulated stablecoin, USD Coin issued by the Centre consortium of Circle and Coinbase, also saw a surge in demand after the news came out, with 8,276,917.27 new tokens minted (1,2,3,4,5,6,7).  The NYAG claimed Thursday that crypto exchange Bitfinex had lost $850 million in customer and corporate funds to a payment processor, and was making up the shortfall by borrowing reserves from Tether, the company behind a dollar-pegged stablecoin of the same name (also known as USDT).  Doubts rekindled  Tether has long claimed that each of its nearly 3 billion circulating tokens are backed 1-to-1 by U.S. dollars. But Thursday's news rekindled long-simmering questions about whether Tether indeed has nearly $3 billion in holdings.  Traders seem to be fleeing to other stablecoins in light of the allegations.  Indeed, according to TokenAnalyst.io, stablecoins not named tether have seen massive volume increases over the past 24 hours, with the majority trading at a premium as well.  USDCoin, the Gemini dollar, TrueUSD, DAI and Pax have all seen their prices climb above the dollar as Tether fell to $0.99.  ""The recent revelations regarding [Bitfinex parent] iFinex and Crypto Capital [the payment processor that allegedly lost Bitfinex's funds] raise questions about the reserves purported to be backing USDT,"" said Jesse Proudman, CEO of Strix Leviathan, a trading tech firm.  As a result, he said:  ""We would expect that this action will cause capital to migrate from Tether to regulated and fiat-backed stable coins like USDS, USDC, TUSD and PAX.”  Chad Cascarilla image via CoinDesk archives  Anna Baydakova contributed reporting",POSITIVE,USDT | TUSD,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | TUSD,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/26/10-million-in-paxos-stablecoins-printed-overnight-following-tether-allegations,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

42381801,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9patV,1556287252,Circle's SeedInvest Takes Step Toward Tokenizing Stocks With Trading License,"Equity fundraising platform SeedInvest, which was recently acquired by cryptocurrency startup Circle, can now operate as an alternative trading system (ATS), the companies announced Friday.  SeedInvest and Circle said in a blog post that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization that oversees broker-dealers and securities exchanges in the U.S., granted the crowdfunding startup an ATS license, letting it facilitate secondary trading of private equities – though notably, these equities cannot be tokenized.  In particular, SeedInvest will offer its users the ability to trade equities first launched on the company's primary markets platform, including startup shares after initial investment.  According to a press release, SeedInvest is the first equity crowdfunding platform to receive FINRA approval to operate a secondary trading marketplace.  No tokens (yet)  While SeedInvest can facilitate secondary trading of equity, only the company's existing business – meaning traditional securities – can be traded.  However, a spokesperson for parent firm Circle told CoinDesk that ""this is an important step forward towards realizing the vision of tokenized securities.""  Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire indicated that the company was looking to tokenize securities when it first made its bid for SeedInvest public last year.  ""Crypto securities are going to become a major new category of securities that ultimately every business is going to adopt, just like every business has a website,"" he said at the time.  The acquisition was finalized in March.  It is unclear when SeedInvest plans to add tokenized securities to the platform.  ""Circle's broader mission is to empower people and businesses to more easily share and create value globally,"" Friday's post said, adding that this means increasing the number of ways startups or individuals can raise funds online.  The post emphasizes that Circle hopes to help accredited and unaccredited investors alike participate in such fundraising projects. Adding a new ATS is part of this mission.  ""The past couple of years has witnessed an explosion in experiments in private capital formation and secondary liquidity, with blockchain-powered digital assets becoming a major new category of assets and technology systems for markets,"" the post said, adding:  ""We believe we are in the early stages of a much broader transformation of global capital markets, and that we will see mature, internet-based capital markets emerge that give companies ranging anywhere from the seed to growth stages more ways to raise capital, as well as a much broader base of investors access to invest in those companies.""  SeedInvest and Circle will continue to work with regulators to build new products and ""innovate the financial system,"" the post indicated.  Allaire told CoinDesk:  ""There's a lot that needs to happen from a regulatory and technical perspective. On the regulatory front, we believe that FINRA still has additional work left to do around areas such as custody, clearance, settlement and record keeping. These are brand new types of investment instruments which require revisiting decade-old policies which weren't constructed with digital assets in mind.""

A report from The Economic Times on Friday, citing anonymous “government officials aware of details” said that a number of government departments in the country have backed the idea of a complete ban on the issuance and trading of cryptocurrencies.  The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Central Board of Direct Taxes, Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority are all in favor of the ban, the officials said.  A draft bill, dubbed “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019,” has also reportedly been shared with certain government departments. While it is not clear what “official digital currencies” refers to, the country's central bank was previously researching launching a digital rupee.  A final bill, based on feedback from the consulted departments, is expected to be proposed to the next government in May following the national elections, the sources indicate.  The country’s Ministry of Corporate Affairs has reportedly provided feedback to the DEA, arguing that most cryptocurrencies are run as Ponzi schemes to defraud investors. The ministry has, therefore, recommended cryptocurrency-related prosecutions take place under the country’s Prevention of Money laundering Act for the time being, as the introduction of the crypto bill will take some time.  Another piece from the same news source says that the CEO of the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) Authority, Anurag Agarwal, also said:  ""When it comes to investor protection, the IEPFA has to take a stand against certain things. Against Ponzi schemes, we are taking a stand. We think that cryptocurrency is a Ponzi scheme and it should be banned.  India’s decision on the legality of cryptocurrencies has been a long time coming. As far back as April 2017, the government set up an interdisciplinary committee to investigate the issue, which was said to be discussing imposing a ban on “private cryptocurrencies” last October. However, the committee was then not in favor of an outright ban, but was rather considering possibly legalizing cryptocurrencies with tough rules attached.  Until a final decision is made, the country's crypto industry is in limbo. Since last year, banks in India have been barred by the central bank – the Reserve Bank of India – from serving cryptocurrency firms and exchanges.  Since then a number of exchanges have filed legal petitions to overturn the RBI ban, and the matter is slowly passing through the Indian supreme court, which has delayed announcing the decision several times while it awaits an opinion from the government. The next hearing is scheduled to take place in July.

42381798,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9palx,1556280015,DeFi Upstart Dharma Brokers $6.4 Million in Crypto Loans in First 3 Weeks,"Crypto loan platforms are booming as ether holders look to mitigate portfolio losses endured during 2018's bear market.  Among these decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, San Francisco-based startup Dharma Labs is emerging as one of the industry leaders by facilitating more than $6.4 million worth for crypto loans since its peer-to-peer lending platform launched on April 8.  For comparison, Dharma has more than $10 million worth of ethereum in its system while the industry incumbent BlockFi garnered roughly $18 million in both bitcoin and ethereum deposits over the past month.  Dharma Labs COO Brendan Forster told CoinDesk that, based on the noncustodial mobile app’s user accounts, roughly 650 people have acted as either a borrower or lender so far.  He said these relatively short-term, fixed-rate loans allow borrowers to lock up ether and borrow the dollar-pegged stablecoin DAI, or vice versa, with lenders earning roughly 2.7 percent interest over a 90-day period.  These Dharma loans are becoming a core part of the DAI ecosystem. Polychain Capital, which in part helps guide the Maker Foundation that governs DAI through its voting power, is also an investor in Dharma Labs. Coinbase Ventures was also involved in Dharma's $7 million funding round earlier this year.  The rising DAI fees also increase Dharma interest rates, Forster said. Both loan platforms rely on the same smart contract, most often associated with MakerDAO, to determine the price feed that defines the collateral’s liquidation rate. If the price of ethereum drops too low, users on either platform could lose their deposits.  As such, the Dharma and Maker communities rely on each other for stability and arbitrage opportunities.  “As DAI slips under a dollar, trading at like $0.97, people can actually go buy DAI and lend it on Dharma for 11 percent annual [interest] rate,” Dharma Labs business development manager Max Bronstein told CoinDesk.  He added:  “With Dharma, we’re actually helping push the [DAI] price back up to a dollar. We’re helping to create [demand] there and filling this gap. Right now DAI holders really don’t have a way to earn interest.”  Indeed, Dharma investor and Autonomous Partners founder Arianna Simpson told CoinDesk some borrowers are using the crypto loans to “lever up on ETH or refinance their [loans] on Maker.”  Growth model  For the time being, Forster said his startup is “subsidizing the market” to encourage growth, with lenders “earning a little bit more than borrowers are paying.”  Although Dharma Labs currently avoids fees of any kind, he said the business model eventually assumes modest fees will replace subsidization. “We will be a very standard revenue-generating business,” Bronstein told CoinDesk earlier this month. “A normal company, making revenue off of good software.”  “They’re becoming the easiest place to earn a yield on your crypto or borrow cryptocurrency,” Simpson said of Dharma.  In the meantime, the goal is for Dharma Labs to add support for bitcoin and more dollar-pegged stablecoins like PAX.  Also, since the Dharma app uses a password and four-digit pin rather than complex crypto wallet keys, Simpson said the startup offers easier onboarding into the broader crypto ecosystem.  Dharma loans can transact directly with any self-custodied ethereum wallet, to send or receive money, rather than requiring direct integration with a specific wallet like the ConsenSys-owned browser app MetaMask.  “Having a product that doesn't require you to use MetaMask and just works is pretty awesome,” Simpson said, adding:  “They’re really focused on how people interact with these products, so I think that’s going to be a key driver for bringing people into the crypto fold.”  Dharma team image courtesy of the company",POSITIVE,ETH | DAI,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TRADING | DAI,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/26/defi-upstart-dharma-brokers-64-million-in-crypto-loans-in-first-3-weeks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27e2fbf5914345037bed450efeb4205a04cf145b-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pb2J,1556276431,2015 Bitcoin Price Resistance Re-Emerges Amid Bitfinex Controversy,"View  Bitcoin’s failure to hold on to the gains above the 50-week moving average, currently at $5,477, could prove costly. A similar rejection in July 2015 was followed by a sharp sell-off.  The daily chart is reporting a bearish divergence of the relative strength index, while short-term averages have shed bullish bias. So BTC could drop below $5,000 over the next few days.  The short-term outlook would turn bullish if the crucial 30-day moving average at $4,998 again provides strong support.  A long-term technical line, which served as strong price resistance four years ago, is capping the upside in bitcoin's (BTC) price.  That line, the 50-week moving average (currently at $5,477) was breached earlier this week. The breakout, however, was short-lived with prices falling more than 5.5 percent to hit a low of $4,991 yesterday, possibly due to a controversy involving crypto exchange Bitfinex and the affiliated stablecoin issuer Tether.  As reported by CoinDesk, New York’s attorney general alleged that Bitfinex secretly used funds from Tether to make up for an $850 million loss of client and corporate funds. The news renewed concerns regarding the legitimacy of the stablecoin widely used to fund bitcoin purchases, sending both the crypto market leader and tether lower against the dollar.  That said, the short-term technical charts had warned of a price pullback prior to the attorney general's announcement.  Bitcoin’s failure to hold above the 50-week MA could be a cause for concern for the bulls, as a similar rejection at the crucial average had ended up killing the nascent bull market in July 2015.  Daily chart: 50-week MA rejections        Back in 2015 (above right), bitcoin violated the bearish lower high of $297 (March high) in the first week of July, confirming a bearish-to-bullish trend change. Despite the bullish reversal, BTC failed to clear the descending (bearish) 50-week MA, then located at $312.  That failure proved costly, with BTC erasing the entire rally from $220 to $317 seen in five weeks to July 12. Further, the average resistance was finally breached in October after it had bottomed out (shed bearish).  Hence, the latest rejection at the 50-week MA (above left) could prove to be a major development – espcially as the average is reporting a bearish slope similar to the one seen in July 2015.  Daily chart  With bitcoin's drop to $5,000, the bearish divergence of the relative strength index (RSI) looks more defined (proper lower high on RSI) than it did 24 hours ago. Further, the price has found acceptance above the 5- and 10-day MAs, which have shed bullish bias.  So, the ascending 50-day MA, currently at $4,572, may come into play over the next week or so.  The short-term bearish view, however, would be invalidated, and prices would likely rise back above $5,600, if the 30-day MA at $4,998 again serves as strong support. That average reversed pullbacks throughout March.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $5,170 on Bitstamp, representing a 3.13 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42381809,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9paxH,1556272855,New Crypto-Mining Malware Targeting Asian Firms With NSA Tools,"A new form of malware is targeting enterprises in Asia to mine monero (XMR) cryptocurrency.  Cybersecurity software provider Symantec published the news in a blog post Wednesday, saying that over 80 percent of victims are located in China, with nations such as South Korea, Japan and Vietnam also seeing activity.  Dubbed ""Beapy,"" the malicious code is a file-based crypto miner, not a browser-based one, the firm said. It works by sending a malicious Excel file to victims as an email attachment, downloading the DoublePulsar backdoor onto the victim’s system if the file is opened.  DoublePulsar (notably developed by the U.S. National Security Agency before it was stolen then released to the public in 2017) was also used in the WannaCry ransomware attack in 2017, according to the post.  Once DoublePulsar is installed on to a victim’s machine, the miner is downloaded. At the same time, it uses another leaked NSA tool, EternalBlue, to propagate across the infected network via unpatched computers where it can steal credentials to further access patched machines.  Cryptojacking malware can have a major impact on enterprises, Symantec said, including slowing down device performance, reducing employee productivity and increasing costs.  Although cryptojacking activity has decreased by about 52 percent over the last year, it is still an area of interest among hackers which largely target businesses.  Symantec said:  “Looking at the overall figures for cryptojacking, we can see that there were just under 3 million cryptojacking attempts in March 2019. While a big drop from the peak of February 2018, when there were 8 million cryptojacking attempts, it is still a significant figure.”  The firm said it first noticed Beapy in January of this year, but activity has increased since early March.  Monero's privacy features make it by far the most popular cryptocurrency among hackers deploying mining malware. A recent academic study estimated that cybercriminals have mined around 5 percent of the total monero in circulation.  Earlier this year, researchers at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks discovered a form of malware that takes administrative control to first uninstall cloud security products and then injects code to mine monero. The same team also discovered another variant that steals browser cookies and other information on Apple Mac computers to directly steal cryptocurrencies.

42381795,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pakh,1556269220,US Prosecutors Charge 2 Foreign Nationals Over Bitcoin Investment Scam,"Two Nigerian nationals have been indicted by U.S. prosecutors for allegedly running a fraudulent bitcoin investment scheme.  The Oregon District Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday that the defendants, Onwuemerie Ogor Gift and Kelvin Usifoh, are charged with 11 counts of wire fraud, as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering.  From December 2017 to June 2018, Gift and Usifoh are said to have promoted the fake bitcoin investment scheme via three websites – wealthcurrency.com, boomcurrency.com and merrycurrency.com – promising investors 20–50 percent risk-free returns with instant withdrawals.  Gift and Usifoh falsely claimed that victims' bitcoins would be invested using “unique trading methods” and that they would maintain a “constant high interest rate.” The pair also allegedly encouraged investors to transfer bitcoin to their own cryptocurrency wallets. Once transferred, Gift and Usifoh would exchange it for their local currency, Nigerian naira.  In over six months, the defendants stole 10.88 bitcoins (worth approximately $56,391 at press time) from three victims, one residing in Oregon and two in California, according to the indictment. They also used a photo of a fourth victim to promote their scheme.  In total, the prosecutors allege Gift and Usifoh received more than 50 bitcoins ($259,000) through the scam.  Largely due to their pseudonymous, online nature, cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly popular as a means to scam investors. But law enforcement is catching up.  Last month, New York prosecutors charged a man in a nine-count indictment for duping investors out of over $200,000 in cryptocurrency and cash. And, in February, a 20-year-old man was indicted in the New York Supreme Court over SIM-swapping identity and crypto theft.  Warning cryptocurrency investors over such schemes, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission jointly issued an alert earlier this week, saying that claims such as ""risk-free"", ""absolutely safe"" and ""guaranteed profit"" are hallmarks of a fraud.

42381773,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pWjb,1556265601,Vitalik Proposal Could Turn Ethereum Staking Into $160 Million Industry,"A new proposal by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of ethereum, suggests he is considering increasing rewards for validators who would secure the operation of the next version of the world's second-largest blockchain.  Ethereum 2.0  is by far the biggest upgrade on the horizon for the ethereum blockchain, today valued at $17.5 billion. Its broader goal is to erase ongoing bottlenecks to transaction throughput and significantly decrease costs on the network.  Rather than relying on a proof-of-work consensus protocol whereby miners compete to bundle together blocks of transactions and add them to the ever-growing chain, ethereum 2.0 will rely on a proof-of-stake consensus protocol whereby validators stake their own funds and attest to blocks and transactions being created on the network.  As such, the security of the ethereum 2.0 network is reliant not upon enormous amounts of computational energy but rather enormous amounts of staked wealth.  “In a proof-of-stake system, your cost of attack is just buying tokens. You basically want it to be unreasonable that anyone would be able to buy so much tokens that they’re able to attack the network,” Fredrik Harryson, CTO of ethereum software client Parity, explained.  As proposed by Ethereum Foundation researcher Justin Drake in recent days, the targeted amount of staked wealth on the network is around 32 million ETH (by today’s estimates, that would be valued at $5 billion.) And based on that amount of targeted staked wealth, roughly $160 million in ETH could be earned annually by the entities that would, as planned, replace the network's current ecosystem of transaction miners.  Reward issuance rates  But how do you get that much value set aside in order to keep the network secure? In order to incentivize that kind of behavior, ethereum developers need to set a return rate – akin to an interest rate – that rewards validators who lock up their ETH and contribute to the security of the blockchain.  “They have to find a number that is appropriate. You don’t want to overpay to secure the chain and you don’t want to underpay,” Jonny Rhea, a protocol engineer at ConsenSys, explained to CoinDesk. “So, the idea was they did some back of the envelope kind of math to figure out what’s it going to be worth and what should we pay to secure the chain which we pay the validators.”  Originally, this “back of the envelope math” suggested the interest rate should be roughly 2.20 percent given an overall amount of 30 million ETH staked on the network.  Should staked ETH numbers drop, this rate of return would increase to incentivize more validators to come online. Should staked ETH numbers rise, this rate of return would decrease to ensure the network is not overpaying its validators for their work.  As Harrysson explained:  “There’s a sliding scale of rewards that depends on how much ETH is locked up in stake. In a system where you have very small amounts of stake locked up, you want to encourage more people to stake and lock up more ETH to increase the security of the chain.”  However, estimations presented by Collin Myers, a token strategist for ConsenSys, back in January suggested that the present rate of return for ethereum 2.0 validators was simply far too low.  Taking into account the minimum staking requirement of 32 ETH, computing costs, code risk, general uptime and maintenance costs, and more, Myers concluded the current ethereum 2.0 specifications resulted in net yields “that are highly unlikely to attract a small validator.” Rhea adds that the same conclusion was reiterated by “several different people” including miners and financial experts in the ethereum community.  The latest proposal, submitted this week by Vitalik Buterin, the founder of ethereum, suggests bumping up the rate of return to 3.30 percent given an overall amount of 30 million ETH staked on the network.  This would mean that ethereum 2.0 validators collectively would receive a maximum annual reward issuance of close to 100,000 ETH, which by today’s estimates would be worth around $160 million.  By comparison, mining on ethereum today is estimated to be a nearly $700 million annual industry.  'It's a subjective measure'  As such, compared to mining on ethereum, the targeted valuation of validating on ethereum is considerably lower. At the same time, so is the overall inflation rate of ETH.  “The base inflation would be ~1 percent and the base return [rate] ~3.2 percent,” estimated ethereum researcher Justin Drake in response to Buterin’s proposal. At present, the inflation rate on ethereum is just over 4 percent.  Counting into this dynamic additional gas costs which on the current ethereum network can be thought of similarly to the costs of writing transactions into a mined block, Drake adds:  “With half of the gas burnt, then inflation [on ethereum 2.0] would be ~0.5 percent and the validator return ~5 percent. Feels healthy!”  In Buterin’s proposal, the validator return rate can be as high as 18.10 percent if only 1 million ETH are staked in the network to as low as 1.56 percent if there’s over 100 million ETH staked in the network.  “It’s more like behavioral economics,” Harrysson told CoinDesk. “It’s a subjective measure of what you want your cost of attack to be. So, the question you always ask yourself in blockchain is how much would it cost to attack this chain?”  These estimations that Buterin has proposed are by no means set in stone. The work going into determining the reward issuance structure, Rhea tells CoinDesk, is like trying to “target the sweet spot” between validator profitability and network security.  Rhea concluded:  “For now, [Buterin’s proposal] is what it’s going to be but it’s being put out as a proposal. People are going to go back to the drawing board. I know Collin Myers from Consensys this weekend is going to rerun his analysis based on [the new numbers] and he’ll probably have some interesting feedback.”  Drawing board image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | MINING | TECHNOLOGY,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/04/26/vitalik-proposal-could-turn-ethereum-staking-into-160-million-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8567a70bf134329b778f9f2e74f4c1b2bd018f2a-1500x985.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42381787,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9pX2T,1556253646,How Crypto Markets Are Reacting to the Tether-Bitfinex Allegations,"The cryptocurrency markets endured a loss of as much as $10 billion around 21:00 UTC on Thursday, following allegations that the Bitfinex exchange covered up an $850 million shortfall using the U.S. dollar-pegged Tether (USDT) stablecoin.  The New York Attorney General's office alleged in a statement on Thursday that Bitfinex lost $850 million and used customer and corporate funds from the affiliated stablecoin operator Tether in a coverup.  The allegations appear to have affected USDT's peg to the U.S. dollars, and have shaken market confidence that triggered an overall sell-off with larger cryptos by market cap such as ether and XRP down 6.99 and 4.8 percent, respectively.  Based on data from CoinMarketCap, the overall crypto market's capitalization dropped by $10 billion to as low as $167 billion around early Friday morning UTC time, and has since then climbed back above $172 billion as of press time.  Daily chart - Tether  At 21:00 UTC on Thursday, the price of USDT began to fall from the desired set price of $1.00 to as low as around $0.955, according to data from the Kraken and OKCoin U.S exchanges – the two that provide trading pair for USDT against the U.S. dollars.  The USDT price has since then climbed back and is currently changing hands around $0.97 on both Kraken and OKCoin, and may see further price uncertainty as the day continues to develop.  Other stablecoin assets such as USDC, TrueUSD and GUSD are all in the green up between 0.25 and 3 percent as a result of shifting investor funds toward some of the other more regulated alternatives.  Interestingly, Maker (MKR), the crypto asset behind the MakerDAO stablecoin project is down 14.65 percent over a 24-hour period, having dropped $73 in value and is currently the worst performer among the top 25 crypto. All despite recent upgrades to stabilize its value through a fee increase.  Daily chart - Other markets  Meanwhile, as seen above, the reaction to the Bitfinex and tether allegations has been negative with the majority of cryptocurrencies flashing red today.  Bitcoin has since recovered slightly and is changing hands at $5,138 after dropping to a low of $4,953 on the Coinbase exchange late Thursday.  And Whale Alert, a Twitter service that monitors blockchain transactions, notified that hours after the news, 3,999 bitcoin, which was worth $20 million, got moved out from Bitfinex's exchange wallets to unknown addresses.  Such recent moves are indicative of trader’s sentiment who are currently seeking to reduce their risk by transferring funds away from the allegedly troubled exchange.  However, others have fared better than some with the majority of stablecoins seeing upside action as investors shift their preference away from Tether to other viable options such as Circle's USDC or Gemini's GUSD.  Ether is today's worst performing asset amongst the top 3 major networks, down 6.91 percent and is struggling to find a strong bid beyond $152 after falling from $165 at 21:00 UTC yesterday.
