42406493,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuvVS,1623107928,El Salvador Commerce Secretary: Bitcoin Won't Replace Dollar,"El Salvador's proposed embrace of bitcoin would not end dollarization in the Central American economy, top government officials said, addressing concerns raised by citizens confused about the plan.      ""The [U.S.] dollar will continue to be the legal tender in El Salvador. Operations can be done with bitcoin – obviously related to its value in dollars,"" Miguel Kattán, El Salvador’s secretary of Commerce and Investment, said in remarks covered by local newspaper El Mundo on Monday.      Providing the most in-depth look yet at President Nayib Bukele’s plan to grant bitcoin legal tender status, Kattan said the still-under-wraps bill would create an opt-in bitcoin economy where the dollar, El Salvador’s official fiat since 2001, remains supreme.      Kattán explained during a Central Bank press conference, the first to address Bukele’s surprise Saturday announcement televised at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, that goods will remain dollar-denominated in El Salvador. A tomato that costs 20 cents, for example, will still cost 20 cents, even among sellers that accept bitcoin.      He sought to reassure Salvadorans fearful of a full pivot to a bitcoin standard. Radical social media prognostications of an economy where goods are priced in satoshis will never come to pass, he said.      The possibility of such a future had sparked pockets of confusion on social media, according to local journalist José A. Barrera.      “Until Saturday very few people knew about cryptocurrencies” in El Salvador, he said in Spanish over a series of Twitter direct messages with CoinDesk. “Let's say it is not a popular topic.” But it began consuming Salvadorans’ online discourse almost at once.      “In social networks and discussions, people associate or think that they [would] have to have bitcoins” once the bill becomes the law.      The discrepancy between the bitcoin price (over US$30,000) and their country’s sub-$300 a month minimum wage has only deepened the confusion, he said. (Bitcoin is divisible to the eighth decimal, making it possible to buy a fraction of a coin, but this is not always obvious to people unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency.)      For this reason, Barrera said that “it's no coincidence” the government’s first official word on Bukele’s surprise announcement includes a promise “that bitcoin will not replace the dollar.”      “What the law will say, at the end of the day, is that you can pay – if the person charging accepts bitcoin and if the person paying wants to pay – using bitcoin,” Kattán said during the press conference.      Even so, Kattán said the bill would recognize bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador. The bill would also come with protections against money laundering, he said.      Kattán said bitcoin presents El Salvador with a growth opportunity. He pointed to the success of a community known as “Bitcoin Beach” where hotels, shops, restaurants and even the water utility accept bitcoin over the low-cost Lightning network.      “There is no difference from what we have today,” Kattan said. For consumers and merchants, “their relationship will always be with the dollar.”      Barrera said bitcoin is “probably” viable in El Salvador as many residents are already plugged into the digital economy.      “But we will have to wait to know what conditions the bill will have, which will surely pass as proposed by Nayib Bukele,"" he said.

42406500,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuvbM,1623105797,Bitcoin’s 'Authoritarian Hipster',"On Sunday, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele tweeted out his new profile picture. It featured the popular, young upstart standing at a podium with a bitcoiner’s blood-red laser eyes (instead of the usual statesman’s stare). In the background stand a few National Guardsmen.      The day before, in a pre-recorded video screened to the 12,000 attendees of Bitcoin Miami, the 39-year-old president announced he had drafted a bill to present to the nation’s legislature to make bitcoin an official currency in El Salvador. It would be a monumental step for the Central American nation, known less for its technological prowess than its significant underbanked population.      Details during the announcement were scant – a version of the bill wasn’t immediately made available – though Bukele sold this move as a way to “provide financial inclusion” for his citizens and “push humanity at least a tiny bit into the right direction.” Changing his Twitter profile to reflect the hodler’s creed might be considered a formal statement on how serious Bukele is about making this happen.      “At this point I don't think this is anything more than a symbolic gesture,” George Selgin, a Senior Fellow and director of the Cato Institute's Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said about the plans in a phone interview. “Obviously he’s a clever politician that knows how to play up to a younger constituency and build popularity.”      Bukele has been lauded as a populist reformer as well as branded an “authoritarian hipster.” He took the presidency in the nation’s most recent election with 53% of the vote after less than a decade holding various mayorships, running on an anti-corruption platform as part of a newly founded third party, Nuevas Ideas (New Ideas).      He describes his politics as neither left nor right, but instead reflective of what everyday Salvadorians want. In most public appearances, Bukele, the son of a rich Palestinian merchant, is seen wearing a backwards hat, aviators and closely trimmed beard. His preferred method of communication? Going direct through social media where he counts millions of followers, often using a tone “more appropriate for tweets about bitcoin or sports,” the Washington Post noted.      More than a year after his inauguration, Bukele’s popularity ratings hover between 80%-90%. During the coronavirus crisis he provided food assistance and $300 direct cash payments, winning him the admiration of his constituents. He has also made an effort to build community centers, expand internet access and put a dent in gang-related crime.      But his governing tactics have, indeed, bent authoritarian at times. In February 2020 he sent armed soldiers into the legislature to demand they approve a loan for security equipment. In April 2020, he released official photos of hundreds of alleged gang members stripped nearly nude and crowded together on a prison floor. On May 1, he led efforts for the legislature to remove five magistrates from the Supreme Court who had opposed his policies. The next day the legislature removed the country’s attorney general.      He ignored Supreme Court rulings challenging his COVID-19 lockdowns and has allegedly harassed political opponents, shunned the media and has vilified human rights groups. The Catholic Church, among other leaders in the country, denounced his “persistent efforts … to erode our democratic order.”      The Washington Post called him a “millennial autocrat” and compared the outsider politician to “political bomb-throwers” like former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and “blustery despots” including the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro.      His latest turn to bitcoin continues these two trends of courting the most vulnerable while attacking the establishment. In his recorded message, Bukele claimed more than 70% of El Salvador’s 6.5 million people were left out of the banking system. A further 2 million or so live in the U.S., from where they send home $6 billion in remittances – which make up about 23% of the nation’s economy – often getting gouged by middlemen.    Read more: Opinion: Bitcoin as Legal Tender? Why El Salvador’s Plan Isn’t as Crazy as You Think    Further, in his announcement Bukele took aim at central banks like the Federal Reserve that are “increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador” by printing money to prop up their own economies. Over the COVID year, Salvadorian exports sank 17%, foreign direct investment dropped $500 million while the country’s debt rose, according to Francisco De Sola, a guest speaker at the Wilson Center.      Making bitcoin a legal tender, Bukele said, fixes this. Not only would it provide a means for people to access an alternative, low-cost financial system, it would also attract investments in the nation. If just 1% of the total BTC supply moved to El Salvador that would grow the nation’s economic output by nearly 25%, Bukele said. To that end, Bukele is working to make the nation’s tax and regulatory frameworks favorable for crypto businesses, and provide “immediate permanent residence for crypto entrepreneurs.”      “We hope that this decision will be just the beginning in providing a space where some of the leading innovators can reimagine the future of finance, potentially helping billions around the world,” he said.      Cato’s Selgin thinks this is mostly political theater and that there wouldn’t be a functional change in how El Salvador operates. “Usually the designation of a currency as legal tender doesn't mean very much. People are already free to ask for bitcoin as payment, if they want.” He noted the Bitcoin Beach community, on the coast of El Salvador, has been piloting a circular bitcoin economy since 2019.      Rohan Grey, one of the authors of the proposed U.S. STABLE Act and Assistant Professor at Willamette Law, agreed the move would likely have little effect. Bitcoin is an inherently flawed currency, Grey said, because of its volatility and deflationary aspects – few would choose it as their primary method of payment.      “Bitcoin as a private currency creates far more problems than it solves by trying to bring it into the legal system,” Grey said. For one, in handing over monetary control to a decentralized network, the Salvadoran government would be giving up some of its ability to set policy. Then there’s the matter of finding a peg for foreign exchange.      “If El Salvador does and demands that its citizens have the right to make those kinds of transactions, that's going to run headlong into the domestic sovereignty of other countries’ legal tender laws,” he said.    Read more: President of El Salvador Says He’s Submitting Bill to Make Bitcoin Legal Tender    Selgin and Grey argue El Salvador would have little meaningful impact for bitcoin itself, as has existed this far without the imprimatur of a government.      “Bitcoin is a phenomenon that has gotten this far on not being a government-based currency,” Selgin said. “It shouldn't matter what Bukele says.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/07/bitcoins-authoritarian-hipster,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da8e5e920746c577d522cad8358fba36b5395bc8-2048x1365.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406510,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuvlC,1623099459,Investors See Possible El Salvador Bitcoin Embrace as Too Little to Move Market,"A push by El Salvador’s president to embrace bitcoin as the country's legal tender is not seen as having much of an impact on the $663 billion bitcoin market, even if it does inspire other countries to do the same.      Investors, analysts and economists were assessing the potential price ramifications Monday after President Nayib Bukele said Saturday he will submit a bill this week to recognize bitcoin as the Central American nation's legal tender.      So far, the market isn't giving much weight to the announcement and bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight range over the past few days around $36,000, still well off the all-time high near $65,000 reached in mid-April.      Traders are still reeling from last month's 35% price retreat, which came after authorities in China moved to put fresh scrutiny and clamps on the cryptocurrency industry.      “Crypto is seen as a way of hedging against political turmoil, but it will need to reach critical mass. El Salvador’s move is unlikely to counter China’s given its relative size,” Santiago Espinosa, strategist at the independent investment research firm MRB, said in an interview.      El Salvador has a gross domestic product of $27 billion versus Argentina's $445 billion or Brazil’s $1.8 trillion. China's GDP was $14.2 trillion in 2019, according to the World Bank.      On the margin, the El Salvador bitcoin news might have helped to offset some of the bearishness in the market, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.      “Bitcoin did not rally much on the news, but it did help counter some of the negative flows that stemmed from deepening China crackdown concerns,” Moya told CoinDesk in an email.      Other analysts pointed to bitcoin’s inefficient use as a medium of exchange as a reason for the lack of market enthusiasm following Bukele’s announcement.    Read more: Bitcoin as Legal Tender? Why El Salvador’s Plan Isn’t as Crazy as You Think    “What El Salvador needs is a U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin with low transaction costs and low latency, given their native currency is already pegged to the U.S. dollar,” wrote Campbell Harvey, professor of finance at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, in an email to CoinDesk.      “There are major obstacles both to making it work in a country with no functioning foreign exchange market and, even more importantly, getting the population to adopt it,” wrote Frances Coppola, columnist at CoinDesk.      Coppola pointed to other nations such as Venezuala where citizens often use digital U.S. dollars via payment apps such as Zelle versus bitcoin for everyday transactions.    Catalyst for adoption    Still, others viewed the El Salvador bitcoin move as another signal for the cryptocurrency's mainstream acceptance, which could be bullish for BTC over the long term.      “People can use bitcoin to reduce their tax liability with the government of El Salvador, creating a fundamental use case for bitcoin,” Ariel Zetlin-Jones, associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.      When Zap's Jack Mallers, on stage at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami, introduced the video where Bukele made his announcement, Mallers described the move as ""one small step for bitcoin.""      ""It's just another node on the network,"" he said. ""But it's a giant step, and a giant leap, for humanity.""      Longer term, according to Espinosa, there's the prospect that other emerging-market nations might follow the country's lead.      “Developing countries are way more prone to legitimize cryptocurrencies with a similar political backdrop,” Espinosa said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/07/investors-see-possible-el-salvador-bitcoin-embrace-as-too-little-to-move-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8650d2672941ed75df7d48860db9eeb1976392d0-1298x927.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $35,679 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Losing 0.25% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $35,335-$36,742 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether (ETH) trading around $2,736 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). In the green 2% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,677-$2,840 (CoinDesk 20)  Remember when bitcoin was at $59,506?    Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down Monday by 0.25% as of press time. It was below the 10-hour moving average and the 50-hour, a bearish signal for market technicians.      BTC’s price jumped from $35,335 at 22:45 UTC (6:45 p.m. ET) Sunday to $36,742 by 02:45 UTC Monday (10:45 p.m. ET Sunday), a 4% climb based on CoinDesk 20 data. Bitcoin then fell below $36,000, at $35,679 as of press time.      “We are now seeing consolidation, with higher lows, and we want to see bitcoin gradually move back up to the higher trend,” said Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment analytics platform Trade the Chain. “We expect to see a large price move in the next 48-72 hours.”      Lest traders and investors forget, less than a month ago bitcoin was priced over $55,000. Specifically, according to CoinDesk 20 data, spot BTC was at $59,506 on May 8.      “The range will break out, yes, definitely, but energy is still not in the market,” said Chris Thomas, head of digital assets at Swissquote Bank. “That said, the energy is shifting to ether from bitcoin.”      Read More: Bitcoin, Gold Are Likely to Withstand Fed Taper, SkyBridge Capital Says    Ether signals some bullishness    Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was trading around $2,736 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), climbing 2% over the prior 24 hours. The asset is below the 10-hour moving average but near the 50-hour, a flat-to-bearish signal for market technicians.      Ether gained from $2,677 at 22:45 UTC (6:45 p.m. ET) Sunday to $2,840 by 16:15 UTC (9:15 a.m. ET) Monday, a 6% jump based on CoinDesk 20 data. ETH has lost some of that climb, at $2,736 as of press time.      “Ether has been making higher highs, order book support continues to rise and sentiment is increasing,” noted Trade the Chain’s Mancini. “These are all bullish signs in a bullish technical formation.”      Another bullish trend: Ether’s dominance, or its share of the greater cryptocurrency ecosystem, is at 19.78% as of press time, the highest it has been since May 16.    Ether volumes higher than bitcoin's    Bitcoin and ether volumes have been lower of late, but one signature phenomenon persists: ETH trading volumes have been higher than BTC's for nine straight days. On Sunday, ether volumes on major spot exchanges tracked by CoinDesk hit $28 million, while bitcoin was a bit behind at $27 million.      Traders seem to be feeling some exhaustion when it comes to bitcoin, and they might be moving some of their investment to DeFi applications where they can park it in blockchain-based protocols to earn yield on the asset. The amount of bitcoin “locked” in DeFi is at 181,455 BTC, the highest since Feb. 26 when it reached a six-month high of 194,519 BTC, according to DeFi Pulse.    Pressure from China    Government officials in mainland China are still putting pressure on crypto mining and trading, quantitative fund QCP Capital noted over the weekend in an investor update. Some investors could be parking bitcoin for the time being, especially given the relative market lull in the past week.      “As China continues to tighten its regulation of cryptocurrencies, the central government has blocked Weibo accounts that promote crypto investing and mining activities,” QCP said. “We will be monitoring the price action over the next few days.”      And while analysts like Trade the Chain’s Mancini are bullish, Alessandro Andreotti, an over-the-counter crypto trader, echoed QCP’s skepticism.      “Right now the market is going through a bit of uncertainty,” Andreotti said. “I personally think the bears might be here to stay for a while.”      Read More: Cayman Islands, U.S. and Gibraltar Are Top Crypto Hedge Fund Jurisdictions    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mixed, but mostly lower Monday.

42406509,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuvmB,1623093137,Bitcoin as Legal Tender? Why El Salvador’s Plan Isn’t as Crazy as You Think,"El Salvador President Nayib Bukele’s proposal to make bitcoin legal tender in his country has been met with understandable head-scratching and skepticism among observers in the developed world.      Speaking to BBC News, Willamette University College of Law professor Rohan Grey said a country that made such a move would cede “its degree of autonomy and control over its own policy space to a network that isn’t stable, doesn’t have accountable actors and doesn’t have a track record of providing the kinds of price stability and liquidity stability that a currency is supposed to provide.”      But to understand why this move might not be as crazy as it sounds to those of us privileged enough to live in countries that have enjoyed such relative stability, let’s zoom out the lens a bit.    Adam B. Levine is CoinDesk’s podcast editor. The views expressed are his own.    Countries like El Salvador have struggled with trust in their local monetary systems. El Salvador in particular, and not uniquely, has two official forms of money in its local system already – locally issued colons and U.S. dollars. On paper, both are good for all debts, public and private, but in practice, one local bitcoiner told CoinDesk, Salvadorans use dollars for commerce and colons as “table ornaments.”      The reason some countries outside the U.S. adopt its currency, or “dollarize” their economies, is that the greenback is seen as more stable and trustworthy. It is, after all, the global reserve currency and makes up much of the savings of central banks, companies and to a lesser extent individuals around the world.      This is true even though the U.S. itself still has inflationary monetary policy in the best of times and since the 2008 global financial crisis has been pursuing a very experimental form of monetary policy involving tools like quantitative easing and a central bank that now directly monetizes, or purchases, government-issued debt to keep interest rates low.      These decisions about how the U.S. dollar is managed may end well, or they may end poorly. We don’t yet know.      But for countries like El Salvador that look to the dollar as a more predictable currency than the one they issue locally – which is more likely to retain its value than the one they issue locally – Washington’s ongoing experiment presents a problem.      These countries look to the dollar for relative stability and predictable monetary policy, but increasingly they see an experimental currency that is completely outside their control and not being managed for their benefit.      Which brings us to bitcoin.    Nothing personal    For a country like El Salvador, bitcoin’s fixed, long-term monetary policy, which cannot be changed except by a real majority of network participants, may offer an appealing alternative to the almighty dollar.      Announcing Bukele’s plan at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami over the weekend, bitcoin entrepreneur Jack Mallers described the move as a reaction to “unprecedented monetary expansion.”      Mallers, whose startup, Zap, is working with Bukele’s government, criticized the U.S Federal Reserve for “crushing emerging markets,” such as El Salvador, by printing money willy-nilly.      According to what appeared to be an excerpt from Bukele's proposed legislation, included in a slide from Mallers’ Miami presentation, ""Central banks are increasingly taking actions that may cause harm to the economic stability of El Salvador.""      ""In order to mitigate the negative impact from central banks, it becomes necessary to authorize the circulation of a digital currency with a supply that cannot be controlled by any central bank and is only altered in accord with objective and calculable criteria,” the excerpt said.      Unlike the dollar, the supply of bitcoin today, next month and 100 years from now can be accurately modeled in advance. A fixed amount of new bitcoins are created every 10 minutes. Every four years, the number of bitcoins created are cut in half. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin and that eventual number will be reached more than 100 years from today.      That we know all of this today is significant and stands in stark contrast to any government-issued currency, including the dollar.      The problem is not who is in control, the problem is that anyone can be in control.      In the U.S. and in most countries, it’s a small group of well-credentialed individuals doing their best to manage their currency for the benefit of their country. Twenty years ago, Bukele’s predecessors in El Salvador decided they didn’t trust themselves with such a task and made the dollar legal tender alongside the colon.      When you ""dollarize"" your economy like this, you are effectively saying, ""Our monetary policy for our local currency is not trusted and stable enough to put all our eggs in that basket, so we'll officially support something outside of our control that allows people to pick and choose without empowering the black market.""      Twenty years ago, that was a thing for which you could reasonably use the U.S. dollar. It was managed for the benefit of the U.S. primarily, but in comparison to other currencies was a rock, boring, reliable and the least bad option available.    Uncharted waters    Today, the dollar is leading the charge of experimental monetary policy, with the supply more than doubling over the last 10 years to $20 trillion as of April, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’ data.      Close to half that $11 trillion increase was added just in the last 18 months to counter the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic.      In this light, bitcoin starts to look like the more “stable” currency. It is not managed for the benefit of any group or people. It just is.      So when people say bitcoin is volatile, they’re not talking about its monetary policy. They’re talking about the current price in dollars.      In a world where the global reserve currency and seemingly every other currency are dictated by short-term government needs, what is the true value of something that isn’t?      For El Salvador, it’s an interesting enough question and we’ll all get to find out the answer.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Adam B.

Colonial Pipeline paid about $4.4 million in bitcoin to the attackers, linked to the Darkside ransomware group, after its payment systems were frozen last month. The company had to halt fuel transportation across the East Coast of the U.S., sparking fears of a gas shortage in a dozen states. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Monday that the company contacted law enforcement, allowing federal agents to track and seize a bitcoin wallet.      ""The Department of Justice has found and recovered the majority of the ransom paid,"" Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a press briefing.      An affidavit filed by an FBI agent provided further details. According to public court documents, the agent, whose name was redacted, tracked the bitcoin Colonial sent to Darkside across several transactions recorded on the bitcoin ledger, using a block explorer.      About 63.7 BTC was sent to an address controlled by the FBI.      The bitcoin appears to come from the affiliate that deployed Darkside's ransomware, not Darkside itself, said Tom Robinson, chief scientist at Elliptic. He told CoinDesk the funds appear to have been seized at 1:40 p.m. ET.      In a blog post, Robinson said 15% of the total payment went to Darkside itself.      ""The private key for the Subject Address is in the possession of the FBI in the Northern District of California,"" the affidavit said.      FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate said federal officials had seized a bitcoin wallet that held the proceeds from the Colonial attack. It appears that the perpetrators still have about $2 million in crypto.      ""Victim funds were seized from that wallet, preventing Darkside actors from using them,"" he said.      The funds were seized as part of a ransomware task force created by the DOJ.      ""The sophisticated use of technology to hold businesses and even whole cities hostage for profit is decidedly a 21st century challenge. But the old adage 'follow the money' still applies. And that's exactly what we do,"" Monaco said.      CNN first reported the news.      Ransomware attacks have been on the rise recently, with a number of high-profile and critical infrastructure firms falling victim to the cyberattack. In her opening remarks, Monaco warned companies to take steps immediately to secure their systems or risk falling victim.      The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately share further details.

42406504,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAeuviF,1623089114,South Korean Parliament Discusses Crypto Bills for First Time,"South Korean lawmakers have drafted crypto legislation for the National Assembly to consider as part of the government’s belated response to the industry’s call for regulatory clarity.      This is the first time crypto-specific legislation is being discussed in the country’s parliament.      On May 7, Democratic Party lawmaker Lee Yong-woo submitted a bill called the “Virtual Assets Act” to the National Assembly. Ten days later, Kim Byung-wook, another Democratic Party lawmaker, pushed forward his own bill, the “Act for Fostering the Virtual Asset Industry and Protecting Investors.”      “We need to establish legal mechanisms for both fostering the domestic crypto industry and protecting investors. Otherwise, South Korea will fall behind the rest of the world,” Kim said.      The Korean government currently doesn’t recognize bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies as financial assets. However, the government has announced it would begin collecting taxes on crypto income starting 2022.      Han Suh-hee, an attorney who advises crypto firms on navigating legal frameworks, has called this position “contradictory.”      “The government is asking traders to pay taxes without offering them any legal protection,” she said during a panel discussion on South Korea’s regulatory environment, which was aired as part of CoinDesk’s Consensus 2021 event on May 25.      Speaking at the same event, CEO Sirgoo Lee of Dunamu, the company that operates Upbit, said “a lack of regulatory clarity” is hurting the industry. He said a wishy-washy stance from the government just confuses businesses and traders alike, which ultimately stunts industry growth.      “The government needs to take a clear stance on what exchanges can do and what they cannot do,” Lee said.    FSC head clarifies position on crypto    Eun Sung-soo, head of the Financial Services Commission (FSC), the country’s top financial regulator, raised alarms on April 22 when he said all of the country’s crypto exchanges could “potentially be shut down.” He also stated it wasn’t the FSC’s responsibility to protect crypto traders and investors from scams, fraud or market manipulation. He said it was the investors’ “personal responsibility” to protect themselves, and called crypto an “inherently speculative asset.”      A month after his somewhat inflammatory comments, Eun seems to have reconsidered his position. Speaking at the Korea Fintech Week 2021 event on May 26, Eun seemed to offer an olive branch to crypto traders, saying traders will “most likely be protected” so long as they trade on “exchanges that register with financial authorities by September.”      Eun added, however, that it’s “not the government’s job to protect traders from crypto volatility.”      The FSC may have adopted a more conciliatory stance on crypto, but many people are still calling for crypto-specific legislation. Current regulations simply apply the traditional finance sector’s anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) protocols to exchanges.      On May 26, the Korea Blockchain Association announced it has formed a task force of industry experts and legal advisers whose specific mission is to inform the government on sensible crypto legislation.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Felix Im,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/07/south-korean-parliament-discusses-crypto-bills-for-first-time,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/329595946d463dc85c3d390df03b309d410b16e3-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386973,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWAtj,1623087006,Justin Sun Has a Serious Side. Here's a Rare Glimpse,"Justin Sun, the influential yet controversial founder of Tron, is mainly known for self-promotion and marketing stunts. A few years ago he tweeted seemingly non-stop about paying $4.6 million to have lunch with Warren Buffett. He plastered his face on the elevators, walls and windows at the New York Midtown Hilton during Consensus 2019. And on Thursday, he offered to buy all the bitcoin Elon Musk sells. Most recently, he said he would build the first crypto organization in El Salvador, whose president declared he wants to make bitcoin the country's legal tender.      So it was somewhat startling when, during a recent Chinese podcast interview with CoinDesk, Sun spoke candidly about his failures. Speaking in Mandarin, he also touched on physics and philosophy, cultural differences between the U.S. and China, and a wild trade that may still keep him up at night.      “I personally think we are not successful, there is a lot we can improve,” Sun said when asked if Tron is doing a good job in going global. “I can talk about a few pits we fell in.”    East meets west    Sun became famous in China for Peiwo, a social media app, and the acquisition of a popular file-sharing protocol BitTorrent. He founded the Tron Foundation in 2017 and raised $70 million through an initial coin offering (ICO) before China deemed such fundraising processes illegal later that year. He built a large presence on Twitter and made his crypto project known among Western crypto communities. But the path wasn’t always smooth.      “In the earliest times, we had some conflicts with Western communities when communicating with them due to negligence,” Sun said. “The core issue is that Western communities take everything too seriously. If you say something, they must see the results and real delivery. They do not care about price as much as the Chinese communities though.”      Western communities can accept a drop in token price, Sun said, but they want projects to deliver on their promises and implement their ideas.      “Chinese communities don’t care about those as much, everything is good as long as the price is going up.”      Sun also noted that if Chinese projects want to attract western communities, being able to speak English is not enough. “We need to learn their culture,” he said. “You need to learn how to use Twitter, Instagram, Reddit and other popular western social media.”      Western developers value open-source projects but that would not necessarily draw Chinese developers to contribute; they need to be paid, Sun said. That is why western projects tend to be more decentralized than some Chinese projects such as Tron and Binance Smart Chain, which are led mostly by just a few developers, he said.      While Sun did not specify what particular event prompted this realization, the profoundly different approaches to governing a blockchain project between Chinese and western teams have sparked one of the most controversial conflicts in crypto history.      The drama was between Tron and a blockchain-based social media platform Steem that rewards its users with cryptocurrency. In late 2019, Sun bought 30% of STEEM token supply from the network’s co-founder Ned Scott. What he apparently considered to be a venture capital investment to acquire the project became an unannounced hostile takeover in the eyes of Steem’s community members. Some of the large STEEM holders were so angry that they slapped TRON with a lawsuit and hard-forked the network into a separate chain called Hive.      Sun said there have also been many communication issues when it comes to interacting with western developers and crypto communities.      “In the early days, some of Tron’s posters and updates were published without me checking; many of them are inconsistent because there are many departments and the company is too big, and people would complain about inconsistency,” Sun said. “We have been trying to improve internally and be more transparent and in sync across different departments to fit into western communities’ culture.”      Another big difference is that western developers have a culture that encourages open-source projects. On the contrary, most people in China work for money, the open-source spirit is not enough, and few people would be willing to contribute to a project without being paid, Sun said.      “Cryptocurrency was born from the same open-source culture,” Sun said. “When we promote projects to western communities, we should put an emphasis on open-source.”    Buffett vs. Musk    While Sun was a recognizable name in crypto circles, he became known to the general public when he won a $4.6 million bid in a charity auction to have dinner with Warren Buffett in 2019. But as much as Sun respects Buffett’s investment approach, he said he thought the Oracle of Omaha might have failed to appreciate the value of crypto.      Buffett referred to bitcoin as “probably rat poison squared” and as a gambling instrument. Charley Munger, vice chairman of Buffett's investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, said bitcoin’s success is “disgusting.” One of the few times Buffett touched bitcoin was when he gave one bitcoin to charity shortly after he received it from Sun.      “For Buffett’s generation, they value companies based on things like P/E ratio and cash flow,” Sun said. But ideas and concepts continue to evolve, he said.      In the Chinese podcast, Sun drew an unusual analogy between crypto’s development in the financial industry and the evolution of classical physics theories.      “In the 19th century, we had [Sir Isaac] Newton's classical mechanics, then we had quantum mechanics in the 20th century,” Sun said. “The biggest difference between these two theories is that, unlike classical mechanics, not everything can be precisely measured in quantum mechanics.”    Musk fan    Sun also spoke at length about Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO who consistently makes waves in the crypto world with his bitcoin and dogecoin-themed tweets.      “Personally, I really admire Elon Musk,” Sun said. “Before I got into crypto, I bought lots of shares of Tesla in 2012. Tesla is also my ‘first pot of gold.’”      Sun said even in 2012 he firmly believed that Elon Musk would be the one that would surpass Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and become “the new god of the scientific world.”      While some investors and financial regulators have accused Musk of using his social media influence to manipulate the stock market, Sun praised Musk for taking advantage of his social media clout to boost his and his companies’ popularity.      “Many people look down on Elon Musk, I think it maybe because people have a stereotype for the richest man or the new gods of technology,” Sun said. “People think they should be like [Microsoft's] Bill Gates or Buffett, who tend to be mellow and quiet, but Elon Musk is too spontaneous and emotionally unstable. But there are no rules that say the richest man has to be quiet, mellow and inactive on social media.”      Sun said he thinks Musk represents a new generation of successful entrepreneurs who are engaging and interact with their fans all the time.      “I indeed did a little research on Gates and Jeff Bezos’ [of Google] social media, they are not active and do not speak in public very often,” Sun said. ""The last times their posts went viral and had more than 10,000 reposts were when they were getting divorced.""      “Musk’s challenge to the traditional image of the world’s richest man is no less than Donald Trump’s challenge to the traditional image of a U.S. president,” Sun said. “You can use Trump to explain Musk. They have similar personalities.”    A wild trade    Sun is heavily invested in the digital asset market, even outside his own company.      During the market crash on May 19, Sun’s $1 billion position was almost liquidated on the Ethereum-based lending protocol Liquidity.      The protocol went into a two-minute recovery mode before it had the chance to liquidate Sun’s position. He paid back the debt shortly after and avoided the liquidation.      “It really was a close call,” Sun said of the trade. “We staked lots of ETH to take out a loan of USDT. Ethereum saw a really big drop, down from over $3,000 to $1,500. We would have been liquidated when it reached $1,500.”      If Sun hadn't been able to pay off the debt he owed within two minutes, he expects his entire position would have been liquidated.      “We were in line to be liquidated but fortunately we were at the end of the line,” Sun said. “There had been more than 30,000 [ether] that got liquidated, it would be really dangerous if that happened when we were asleep.”      If Sun’s massive position had been liquidated, ether might have dropped below $1,000 and triggered a bigger slump.      According to on-chain data, Sun rebalanced his trove shortly after the price touched $1,500 by paying $300 million back. Sun said he had 50% leverage at the time but has decreased his leverage since then.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/07/justin-sun-has-a-serious-side-heres-a-rare-glimpse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/556ff8c60684b06cef61d503074efb3a0ed7781b-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWBGN,1623085926,"Deutsche Bank Issues Stark US Inflation Warning, Seeing Economic Parallels to 1940s, 1970s","Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender, says the U.S. might be headed for one of its worst inflationary periods in history, arguing that elevated government spending and loose monetary policy could combine to create conditions similar to prior episodes in the 1940s and 1970s.      Adding to the pressures are some $2 trillion of ""excess savings"" that consumers have amassed over the past year, when many businesses were closed and travel mostly shut down, according to the report published Monday.      ""Consumers will surely spend at least some of their savings as economies reopen,"" wrote Deutsche Bank Chief Economist David Folkerts-Landau along with Peter Hooper, global head of economic research, and Jim Reid, head of thematic research.. ""This raises the very real specter of consumer-driven inflation.""      Inflation is closely watched by cryptocurrency investors who view bitcoin as a hedge against dollar debasement.      But bitcoin has also traded at times in sync with risky traditional assets like stocks, and the Deutsche Bank authors warned that when inflation does eventually appear, the Fed might have to react forcefully, which could “create a significant recession and set off a chain of financial distress around the world.”      The warning comes in marked contrast to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's repeated assurances that elevated inflation readings are probably ""transitory,"" and will settle back over time as the economy recovers from last year's pandemic-induced recession.      “A lack of preparation for the return of inflation is concerning. Even if some inflation today is transitory, it may feed into expectations as in the 1970s,” according to the report. “Even if only embedded for a few months, these expectations may be difficult to contain with stimulus so great.”    One signal to watch is the output gap, which measures the imbalance between demand and supply, expressed as a percentage of an economy’s gross domestic product.  Deutsche Bank expects the U.S. output gap to rise above 2%, the highest in over two decades as demand exceeds supply, resulting in higher prices.  After the financial crisis of 2008, the ""quantity of U.S. stimulus was insufficient to close the output gap, and the recovery was needlessly slow.""  But an elevated output gap during the 1960s preceded the high inflation of the 1970s, which was exacerbated by a series of oil-price shocks.    Deutsche Bank estimates that legislated stimulus packages have totaled in excess of $5 trillion, or more than 25% of gross domestic product. The U.S. federal deficit is likely to come in at 14% to 15% of GDP in both 2020 and 2021, versus about 10% in 2009.      Around World War II, according to the economists, U.S. deficits remained between 15% to 30% for four years.      ""While there are many significant differences between the pandemic and WWII we would note that annual inflation was 8.4% in 1946, 14.6% in 1947 and 7.7% in 1948 after the economy normalized and pent-up demand was released,"" according to the report.      The current political climate means that jobs growth may be a higher priority in the coming years than keeping inflation at bay.      Unlike in the early 1980s, when then-President Ronald Reagan supported Fed Chair Paul Volcker ""putting the economy through a wringer to quell inflation, the problem is today viewed as much less important than unemployment and the broader goals of achieving greater equality in income and wealth,"" according to the report.      ""The Fed's move away from preemptive action in its new policy framework is the most important factor raising the risk that it will fall well behind the curve and be too late to deal effectively with an inflation problem without a major disruption to activity,"" the authors wrote.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | RESEARCH,Damanick Dantes,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/07/deutsche-bank-issues-stark-us-inflation-warning-seeing-economic-parallels-to-1940s-1970s,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7fa03b17f753bd02f254adfac3bbcbf142b416b8-1900x1268.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As I was working on this post, I went and watched a few videos for the upcoming game Chainmonsters, from Dapper Labs, the company Crunchbase credits with $357 million in investment. The game is still in alpha, it should be noted, and it's updating all the time, including recently slicking up its graphics.But the game is basically one where you wander around a world gathering up little monsters, playing them in fights to increase their experience and make more badass monsters. What does that sound like? It sounds like Pokémon.      Apparently this is so true that, at least according to YouTuber nondairi, folks who compare the game to Pokémon actually get kicked out of the game's Discord. Which is weird because it's not even the first Pokémon knock-off to show up on the blockchains. We covered Etheremon, for example, three years ago.      And look, I get it: A game doesn't have to be amazingly advanced to capture popular imaginations. The bizarrely profitable mobile game, Flappy Bird, came out in a year when Assassin's Creed was on its fourth iteration. It is possible for a simple game to take off, but the popularity of Flappy Bird was a wild outlier. The popularity of any entry in the Assassin's Creed mythos is not.      And, on that note: right next to one of the videos I watched about Chainmonsters was a video about a forthcoming game for the PlayStation, Horizon: Forbidden West, from Guerrilla Games. This was an absolutely insane gameplay preview where some guy rides a cyborg elephant the size of a building and then later the player's character takes an enemy out with this insane spin-kick stab combo followed by an exploding lightning bolt bow-and-arrow finisher.      It's hard to describe, in a good way.      So crypto will need to make something comparably impressive and drop immutable in-game items somewhere in its guts before gamers really get excited about this industry. It takes a lot of money and a lot of talent to put together a game that really captures gamers' attention, but a few people in this industry have made a little money, or so I'm told.      So far, the blockchain gaming offerings have largely been slightly lower fidelity derivatives of past video game blockbusters, as if entrepreneurs in this space lack conviction that a truly original, crypto native game can be really good.      You can find lots of videos out there about blockchain games where people brag about making money. It's a whole weird thing. What you can't find are videos of people saying: ""I can't stop playing this thing"" and ""here's how you win.""

42395290,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASYKpI,1623083449,Bitfinex Now Owns a Stake in No-KYC Bitcoin Exchange Hodl Hodl,"Bitfinex, one of the largest centralized crypto exchanges, is now a shareholder in a decentralized exchange (DEX) that doesn’t conduct know-your-customer (KYC) checks.  The British Virgin Islands-based exchange has purchased a stake in Hodl Hodl, a DEX that provides lending and private transaction services.  “When it comes to genuine support of the bitcoin ecosystem, Bitfinex is about action rather than just words,” said Paolo Ardoino, CTO at Bitfinex, in a statement shared with CoinDesk. “Our investment in Hodl Hodl will help grow its amazing community and support the wider digital token ecosystem.”  A move might seem a bit unorthodox for Bitfinex, the sixth-largest spot exchange in the world and a sister firm of the major stablecoin issuer Tether. Centralized exchanges have been closely watching the fledgling decentralized finance (DeFi) industry since last year’s boom and some, like Binance and FTX, are dipping their toes in the sector by launching Binance DEX and Serum.  Bitfinex, in fact, was one of the first to launch its own DEX, Ethfinex, back in 2017. The exchange later spun off of Bitfinex and was rebranded as DiversiFi.  However, major exchanges haven’t invested in outside DeFi vehicles so far. And in addition to being the first, Bitfinex also made a somewhat unexpected choice of partner: Unlike most DEXs, Hodl Hodl runs on the Bitcoin blockchain. The firm has also recently launched a peer-to-peer lending platform, Lend, allowing users to borrow stablecoins, including tether, directly from other users for bitcoin collateral.  And here is where Bitfinex comes into play.  “Bitfinex will provide us more liquidity for lending,” Hodl Hodl CEO Max Keidun told CoinDesk, pointing out that Tether, which shares executives and corporate ownership with Bitfinex, is the issuer of USDT, the most popular stablecoin to date.  “The demand for lending is growing, and sometimes we don’t have enough liquidity on the platform,” Keidun added. “So we need an institutional provider, and soon, some more institutions will join [Lend] as well.”  He said that since the lending platform launched over seven months ago, more than 800 loans have been issued worth over $10 million in total.  CEX-DEX integration?  In addition to the extra liquidity, the Hodl Hodl and Bitfinex alliance will bring some more bonuses, Keidun said. Both exchanges are users of Liquid, a permissioned settlement layer for exchanges run by Blockstream. The two exchanges have been thinking of releasing some new features on Liquid together, Keidun said.  Another opportunity is a potential integration of Hodl Hodl with Bitfinex’s API, which would help Hodl Hodl users to automatically convert bitcoin into stablecoins through Bitfinex, Keidun said.  On Lend, lenders and borrowers open two out of three multisignature wallets in which borrowers lock their bitcoin collateral to receive stablecoins from lenders (stablecoin transactions happen outside of the platform).  When the loan expires, or if the price fluctuates too much and the collateral doesn’t sufficiently cover the loan anymore, the bitcoin collateral gets liquidated: part of it equal to the amount of borrowed stablecoins goes to the lender, and the rest goes back to the borrower, as the loans are normally over-collateralized.  So if a lender doesn’t want bitcoin instead of the stablecoin they provided earlier, they can immediately exit back into stablecoins via Bitfinex, with a proper integration, Keidun said.  At the moment, the Hodl Hodl team, around 20 people, holds around 70% of the company, Keidun said, and the rest is in the hands of a handful of investors, including Lemniscap venture fund and bitcoin advocate Stefan Jespers.  These numbers will not change after Bitfinex enters the scene: It has bought an undisclosed amount of shares from another investor on the secondary market, Keidun said. Bitfinex will be a significant shareholder, but it won’t make Hodl Hodl dependent on its partner, he adds.  “Every decision at Hodl Hodl is made by the team. We’re fully autonomous and independent from our shareholders,” Keidun said, adding: “Of course, we consult with our investors and don’t make important strategic shifts without talking to them. But, in general, we’re independent and autonomous.”  Regulatory concerns  Another interesting point in this new alliance are potential regulatory ramifications as Hodl Hodl is by design a KYC-free crypto business. Bitfinex only recently recovered from a court battle with the New York Attorney General, which alleged Bitfinex covered a $850 million hole in its budget with the funds from Tether’s reserves. The case ended with a settlement, and now Tether is obliged to provide the breakdown of its reserves on a monthly basis.  Hodl Hodl is one of the very few places allowing bitcoin purchases for fiat with no know your customer/anti-money laundering checks. As Hodl Hodl’s team says, the exchange’s non-custodial approach allows it to be “exempt” from the KYC/AML requirements for crypto, which has been increasingly spreading across the world under the auspices of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  But Hodl Hodl, which runs on multisignature bitcoin contracts, doesn’t custody users’ fiat or crypto, CEO Keidun said, which makes it “exempt” from the KYC requirements. All the deals are executed automatically, directly between users’ personal bitcoin and fiat accounts except for the disputes, when the Hodl Hodl team weighs in with its own private key for a multisig and releases funds to whatever party is considered right.  This makes Hodl Hodl closer to the DeFi enterprises like Uniswap than to centralized exchanges like Bitfinex. However, such DEXs, running on Ethereum or other blockchain smart contracts, normally don’t allow you to buy crypto for fiat – for that, you need to go to a centralized exchange, which accepts your fiat and requests a KYC verification.  This combination of a fiat on-ramp and non-custodial approach makes Hodl Hodl a somewhat exotic creature on the current crypto landscape, and a rare exception from the prevalent attitude towards more compliance and regulation.  Asked if this worries investors at all, Keidun said that talks about KYC happen “quite rarely.” From time to time, however, some investors would ask: “What if new regulations get introduced?”  “If KYC requirements get introduced for non-custodial services, we have plans for how we structure our business for different scenarios playing out,” Keidun said.  Asked if Hodl Hodl’s no-KYC policy is of any concern for Bitfinex, the company’s senior PR manager, Joe Morgan, declined to comment on the matter, saying that “this is really a question for Hodl Hodl, as Bitfinex is merely collaborating with them.”  UPDATE (June 9, 2021, 11:35 UTC): Corrects Bitfinex's registered location; clarifies Bitfinex's relation to DiversiFi.",POSITIVE,USDT,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | USDT,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/07/bitfinex-now-owns-a-stake-in-no-kyc-bitcoin-exchange-hodl-hodl,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d4d988bb1b082b7bef3a361eeeb68f4d8b8b59d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In fact, the added purchase of bitcoin would seem to be a doubling down of sorts, for even as company expressed its intention to buy more of the leading cryptocurrency, it warned that based on the fluctuations of the price of bitcoin during the Q2 to the present date, it sees taking an impairment of at least $284.5 million for the quarter ending June 30.      Mark Palmer, a BTIG fintech analyst who covers MSTR, noted that the impairment that MicroStrategy is forced to report on its bitcoin holdings is based on the lowest price of bitcoin within the quarter. If bitcoin rebounds within that quarter, the company cannot write it back up.      While MicroStrategy has raised money to buy bitcoin from the proceeds of notes offerings before, it was always done by notes that were convertible into the company's shares. This time the notes are to be guaranteed on a senior secured basis by MicroStrategy Services Corp, a subsidiary of MicroStrategy.      Saylor has committed to not diluting existing shareholders of the two convertible bond offerings he did in December and February, said MTRS equity analyst at BTIG Mark Palmer.      It’s typical for software companies that have steady recurring revenues to be highly leveraged, in the range of 6 to 10 fold, Palmer added.      “For MicroStrategy to flow $400 million in senior notes when it is tracking to post something in the neighborhood of $90 to $100 million of adjusted EBIDTA does not seem particularly onerous in our view,” Palmer said.      Shares of MicroStrategy, which had soared to a two-decade high in February thanks to a surging bitcoin, have plummeted almost 55% since then as they followed bitcoin back to earth.      The company said it has formed a new subsidiary, MacroStrategy LLC, which will hold its current stash of 92,079 bitcoin. It’s unclear if the company will self-custody the bitcoin, but the subsidiary will allow it to have a more “elegant organizational structure” in which it can focus on its bitcoin investments separately, Palmer said.      Nate DiCamillo contributed to reporting.      UPDATE (June 7, 15:10 UTC): Adds information about the impairment, terms of the notes offering.

42386984,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWB3n,1623067200,Information Wants to Be Free but Secrets Are Worth Paying For: HotNewCrypto's Story,"HotNewCrypto dropped from several thousand users to fewer than 100 when the website started charging for its service, but its operators say the cash flow was well worth the lost popularity.      The site, run by a pseudonymous team, scours Twitter at machine speed to find buzzy young cryptocurrency projects for potential investment (hence the name). On April 19, HotNewCrypto shut down the free Telegram bot that surfaced its discoveries and removed a public leaderboard ranking them by the engagement they elicited. To get this intel, users would now have to pay $2,500 a month for a gated service called Secret Party.      The move brought howls of derision. Here are some samples of comments in its Telegram group:    ""2500/month hahahahaha""Hahahahbaa""Hahahahha""Hahahahaha""    And:    ""alright time to build a clone and make it free""    But also:    ""Well this was bound to happen, if everyone new alpha, it wouldn’t be alpha, it would just be beta""    That last comment speaks to the problem HotNewCrypto faced.      ""We're in the business of secrets basically and the problem with secrets is, the more they propagate the less value they have,” said E.S., the only North America-based member of the three-person founding team.      That is why the group decided to throw most of what they had built behind the paywall. The goal was to learn if they could find 20 customers willing to pay the admittedly intimidating fee, roughly equal to the rent on a two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y. A month into the experiment they succeeded. According to E.S., HotNewCrypto now has between 50 and 100 customers, but closer to the high end of that range.      These people, he said, were more than happy to pay such a high fee for access to new projects before others do. The service had already been worth much more than that to them, and supporting the team to find additional signals would be even more helpful.    Establishing value    As they researched the space, E.S. said, the team realized that others were providing similar services but they called it “research.” Research is different, he said, because it provides enriched information. Secret Party doesn't offer enriched information, but it offers actionable information fast.      The team also learned that investors already trade information informally to some degree. They call it ""alpha trading."" (“Alpha” is an old Wall Street term for above-market returns, and is used loosely in crypto circles to mean competitive advantage.)      The Telegram group that started it all has reached more than 4,000 members. Not only did spreading these leads so widely undermine their value to those willing to pay $2,500 for access, it could also pose a problem for very young projects. Founders could end up being flooded with inbound messages looking for airdrops or cheap tokens, long before they were ready to entertain such requests.      On the other hand, there are some inbounds that new projects don't want to miss. ""Those projects, when they are really new, are very interested in people who can help,"" E.S. said.      HotNewCrypto has no investors, but the new customer cash flow has allowed it to expand its operations, E.S. said. It now casts a wider net than Twitter, finding projects sometimes before they even have a social media presence, when one of the founders is just kicking around ideas on GitHub, for example.      The payments are accepted in five different cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, ether, USDC, litecoin and dai) and processed by Coinbase Commerce, according to a checkout page generated when CoinDesk staff checked out the order flow There is no option listed for paying fiat. (Unlike rival processor BitPay, Coinbase Commerce does not convert crypto to fiat for its merchant clients; those who want to do so must withdraw their coins to an exchange such as its namesake sister company.)    It's still early    HotNewCrypto refers to its approaches for automating discovery of embryonic projects as ""strategies."" (That's the same term DeFi darling Yearn Finance uses for the particular magic its so-called vaults use to maximize yield.) The subscription income has helped the team build more alpha-hunting strategies that isolate even stronger signals from the noise online, E.S. said.      The team has also gotten a lot better at sorting projects to surface. In an ideal world, E.S. said, they would be able to automate finding the most promising new projects. That can be quite hard, he said, because the signals there are tricky (maybe impossible) to spot.      Culling junk from the list, though, can be a lot simpler, and that's also helpful for folks looking to trade on good information early. ""There's a lot of interesting things that can be done with comparison,"" he said.      He gave one example of how culling junk can be automated. The worst projects, he said, just copy a large portion of the code base they use, whether it's the software running their smart contracts or the one that runs their site on the old-fashioned web. There's also telling metadata that machines can read.      ""To me it feels like crypto is a thousand times more than tech in terms of noise,"" E.S. said.      HotNewCrypto has always been blockchain neutral. It looks for projects wherever they might pop up, be it on Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain or elsewhere.      Fans of the old site have reason to rejoice: the free leaderboard went back up, though it is a bit more limited now. It shows the most trending new projects over the past quarter. For up-to-the-minute leaders, users will have to pay that $2,500.      E.S. said the team plans to roll out additional tiers that would help less deep-pocketed people get in early on airdrops and other opportunities the retail market likes to chase for a more reasonable price.      To that end, HotNewCrypto has also created another free Telegram channel, Rekt Party, that highlights dubious opportunities. Its sardonic tagline: ""Be the first to know about the latest s**tcoins and future rugpulls. There might even be a gem or two in there ... Don't get rekt.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | YFI | RESEARCH,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/07/information-wants-to-be-free-but-secrets-are-worth-paying-for-hotnewcryptos-story,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/de60788c563a4337dcf37b09dff3b5e63e2e8e64-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""All fiat-currency alternatives – which have all gone through fairly recent substantial corrections – are in a much better place now to handle that eventual taper and gradual slowing of money-supply growth than they were as they were making higher-highs after higher-highs,"" Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer and senior portfolio manager at SkyBridge Capital, told Bloomberg last week.      ""We're going to stick to bitcoin and crypto because we just think there's more upside,"" Gayeski added.      ""Taper"" refers to a gradual unwinding of the monetary stimulus that has triggered risk taking across financial markets over the past 12 months. Bitcoin, for one, rallied from $10,000 to over $60,000 in the seven months to April before recently falling to $30,000. Gold rallied to record highs above $2,000 an ounce in August 2020. However, the yellow metal deflated to lows near $1,680 early this year and was recently trading near $1,880.      Markets have been betting on an early unwinding of stimulus by the Fed ever since the U.S. economy started to show signs of life in the first quarter, reinforced by April inflation climbing to the highest level since 2008.      On Sunday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said President Joe Biden's $4 trillion spending plan would be positive for the economy, even if it leads to higher interest rates.      Taper talk or rate-hike expectations tend to lift yields on U.S. Treasurys, making the dollar more attractive and weakening demand for assets like gold and bitcoin. The 2013 ""taper tantrum"" prompted a decline in gold and emerging-market currencies.

Furthermore, the Fed has downplayed the inflation scare and taper speculation in recent weeks, and remains committed to buying $120 billion of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities a month.      Gayeski expects the central bank to stand pat for the rest of the year. ""Even when it's announced, the Fed is not going to start reducing the pace of its purchases until 2022,"" Gayeski said.

42386988,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWB7Z,1623056400,"Remember JPM Coin? Next Step Is Programmable Money, Bank Exec Says","Two years after JPMorgan grabbed headlines with plans for an in-house digital token, the global megabank is looking to fulfill one of the great promises of electronic currency: programmable money.      Formally launched in October, JPM Coin is, for now, more akin to JPMorgan’s corporate clients holding their U.S. dollar deposit accounts on a blockchain, said Umar Farooq, head of the bank’s Onyx suite of applications.      That naturally enables 24/7 money movement among those corporations. Overshadowed lately by the crypto bull market, JPM Coin runs in conjunction with the 400-bank Liink payment network and powers things like securities settlement (in repo trades) across JPMorgan’s client base.      But according to Farooq, it’s only the beginning. Aping dollar-pegged stablecoins, or emulating cryptocurrency generally, was never the plan for JPM Coin (which, to be clear, is not available to retail investors nor traded on any crypto exchange).      “We are getting into the programmability of JPM Coin,” he said in a recent interview. “Actually programming what money can do for you, whether it’s conditional payments, whether it’s things like tax assessments. That’s all very rule based and, in the past, you would have to send specific instructions to a bank like JPMorgan. We increasingly want you to be able to program these things, and actually tell the money what to do.”      That desire helps explain why JPMorgan chose to build its various blockchain projects on Ethereum (albeit a bespoke version of it) five years ago. Now the second-largest blockchain as measured by the market cap of its native token, ether, Ethereum was designed specifically to enable complex “if this, then that” programs (known as smart contracts) that were hard to do on Bitcoin, which was built for the straightforward task of transferring digital cash from A to B.      “When we looked at Ethereum versus other options, we were very attracted by the smart contract ability,” said Farooq. “The fact that you could do more things than just a uni-dimensional value transfer on that platform.”    Eye on DeFi    Ethereum also comes with the likely support of the largest developer ecosystem in blockchain. And it keeps the door ajar for a bank like JPMorgan when it comes to the rapidly-expanding public crypto arena.      The big story these days concerning Ethereum is the open, gatekeeper-free hotbed of pseudonymous trading and lending known as decentralized finance (DeFi).      Institutions are slowly but surely edging towards areas like DeFi, with banks such as Netherlands-based ING already talking about what can be learned from this new paradigm.      Fortunately for JPMorgan, Quorum, its permissioned version of Ethereum technology, means the bank remains close to the action; what Farooq calls a “front-row seat” when it comes to innovations happening in the public blockchain arena.      “We are keeping a very close eye on the DeFi evolution,” the JPMorgan blockchain chief said.      “Although it's very much in the public crypto sphere currently, there is clearly a future for DeFi as other assets start to get put on blockchains – whether they're permissioned or they're fully public, it remains to be seen,” Farooq added.      As well as the allure of DeFi, there are even some banks said to be eyeing the possibilities offered by proof-of-stake (PoS) participation on networks like Ethereum, an energy-efficient alternative to Bitcoin’s mining process, whereby one earns by having some skin in the game and validating transactions.      “When it comes to ETH 2.0 staking, that's going to be a very interesting development,” Farooq said. “I think that might open more doors for people to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem.”    ConsenSys deal    Farooq dismissed the notion of an unwavering “passionate link” between the bank and Ethereum. That said, support for Ethereum has existed from the very early days, Farooq added, such as from folks like JPM’s head of Quorum engineering, Samer Falah.      Indeed, JPMorgan’s relationship with Ethereum is long and varied. Formalized with the creation of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance in 2017, the ties strengthened last year when JPMorgan handed the day-to-day running of Quorum over to ConsenSys, the Brooklyn, N.Y.-based software studio helmed by Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin. JPMorgan also led a $65 million funding round in ConsenSys.      “We've known Joe [Lubin] for a long time,” said Farooq. “So our view was that being part of ConsenSys also keeps us close to Ethereum proper in terms of its evolution and gives us a bit of a front-row seat.”      It’s also found a good home for Quorum because JPMorgan is not a software company. The word on the street was that the day-to-day management of Quorum was becoming a headache for the bank.      “As long as it was a small thing that was kind of being done in a corner, that was fine,” Farooq said. “The moment it started scaling up, we would get calls from our largest clients saying, ‘We're going to build on Quorum, can you give us managed services support?’ That’s when we started to consider strategic options for Quorum to continue to grow and succeed outside of the bank.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/07/remember-jpm-coin-next-step-is-programmable-money-bank-exec-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3ccc0490d1075687515c13a801cf51c6d970a1c-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386982,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWB1H,1623037193,Auction House Phillips to Accept Crypto for Banksy Artwork Worth Millions,"British auction house Phillips will accept ether and bitcoin in an upcoming auction of artist Banksy's “Laugh Now Panel A,” estimated to be worth between US$2.8 million and $4.1 million.    As reported by the South China Morning Post on Sunday, bidding at the auction will be conducted in Hong Kong dollars, with the winner having the option to pay in either dollars or crypto.  Banksy's artwork for sale depicts a monkey wearing a sandwich board that says, ""Laugh now, but one day we’ll be in charge.""  The ability to pay in crypto at the auction, slated for Tuesday, is in direct response to a large number of questions from the auction house's clients, according to Jonathan Crockett, head of 20th Century & Contemporary Art and deputy chairman, Asia.  Crockett also said the exchange rate of bitcoin, ether and Hong Kong dollars will be referenced from U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase on the day of the auction while the seller will bear the risk of the Hong Kong dollar to bitcoin volatility.  Phillips joins auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's in offering the ability to pay in crypto for expensive artworks listed on their platforms. The move marks a growing trend of auction houses to capture additional capital outside traditional means.  The 225-year-old auction house was founded in 1976 by Harry Phillips, who was a clerk of the auctioneer James Christie, and has headquarters in London and New York.
