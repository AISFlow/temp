42426416,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbvh,1436912447,North Carolina Senate Committee Advances Bitcoin Bill,"A legislative bill that would cover bitcoin and digital currency related business activities has advanced in the North Carolina Senate.  According to the The Associated Press, the Senate Commerce Committee gave its stamp of approval to SB 680, which was originally filed in March. The bill passed in the North Carolina House of Representatives by a wide majority of 117-1 in May.  As noted by a spokesperson for the North Carolina's Commissioner of Banks at the time, the bill – which amends the state's Money Transmitters Act – covers any activity ""involving a personal, family or household purpose"".  The bill was framed as an effort to make the agency's oversight of the digital currency sector more robust, as it believed existing statutes already outlined how it would go about supervising such activities.  If passed and signed by North Carolina Governor Pat McRory, the bill would mandate minimum net worth requirement of $250,000 for applicants. Businesses would also be required to post a surety bond of $150,000, an amount subject to change based on future transaction volume.  SB 680's primary sponsor is State Senator Rick Gunn. The House version of the bill submitted by State Representative Stephen M Ross, who also acts as a vice president and investment officer at Wells Fargo.  Notably, some senators reportedly took issue with the idea that digital currencies are not backed by any institution, according to the AP report.

42426415,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNbth,1436906622,Russian President Vladimir Putin Addresses Digital Currency,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued his first remarks on bitcoin and digital currencies in an educational forum broadcast on domestic TV network Russia 24.  Local news sources including Gazeta, state-operated news agency RIA and TASS are reporting Putin indicated his belief that the Bank of Russia, the country's central bank, has so far taken a reasonable stance on the technology by exploring, not rejecting, its applications.  Further, he suggested that while he considered the use of digital currency as money to be perhaps problematic, the technology could be best considered as a novel way to manage or calculate transactions.  ""[Bitcoins] are backed by nothing. This money [is backed by nothing], that's the point, this is the major problem. They are not really linked to anything and backed by nothing,"" Putin said. ""However as an accounting unit, these 'coins' or whatever are they called, they can be used, and their adoption becomes wider and wider. As some kind of unit in some account, probably, it's possible.""  Putin continued:  ""We do not reject anything, but there are serious, really fundamental issues related to its wider usage, at least, today.""  A spokesperson for the president later specified in a separate announcement that he was speaking broadly about digital currency technology, not specifically bitcoin.  ""It's the biggest sign of bitcoin legality now in Russia,"" ICBIT Trading CEO Aleksey Bragin told CoinDesk. ""It was not forbidden before, but it was impossible to operate any bitcoin business in Russia (no bank accounts, to start with), and mining was always a gray area.""  Other members of the local community saw it as a similarly positive step for a country that has long had one of the most reactionary stances to the technology.  ""While Mr Putin didn't say anything concrete about bitcoin legislation in Russia, it's definitely a good sign that our government doesn't want to prohibit something before getting a better insight in the field,"" Indacoin CEO Stanislav Kosorukov said.  Ivan Tikhonov of Russian-language bitcoin news source BTCsec added his belief that the statements did much to advance the conversation regarding whether their is government support for the technology.  ""One thing is certain, no one talked about the fact that bitcoin is prohibited or required to be prohibited,"" he added.  The announcement follows reports that the country's lawmakers had updated a draft bill aimed at outlawing the use of digital currencies as monetary surrogates.  CoinDesk is monitoring this developing story.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/07/14/russian-president-vladimir-putin-addresses-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7d95440f33bb124261cbb883ff955c58b2f80ac5-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426427,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNcFh,1436903776,Standard Chartered Exec Touts Blockchain Tech for Trade Finance,"The bitcoin blockchain could hold the keys to reducing the cost of credit cards, money transfers and remittances, according to Standard Chartered chief innovation officer Anju Patwardhan.  In a new LinkedIn post, Patwardhan outlined her views on the technology, suggesting that the true innovation behind bitcoin is its decentralized public ledger, the blockchain.  Patwardhan dismissed the idea that bitcoin could become a viable alternative currency, inferring that she saw these developments in the space as a distraction that has taken attention away from the system's underlying benefits.  Patwardhan wrote:  ""The banking industry is starting to see the many potential benefits of its underlying technology. For banks, the blockchain has the potential to become a technology model for a low-cost and transparent transaction infrastructure.""  Further, she said the public, yet pseudonymous nature of transactions on the bitcoin blockchain could help make financial institutions more transparent, while combating against money laundering and other fiscal crimes.  ""Another area where the blockchain technology can be useful is trade finance. This has traditionally been a paper-intensive process but it is possible to use blockchain technology to digitise and authenticate the records,"" Patwardhan continues.  As evidence that banks should perhaps be paying closer attention to the space, Patwardhan cited the increasingly positive remarks of government financial entities such as the Bank of England and the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Though she suggested that the blockchain may provide the most immediate opportunity for financial entities, however, Patwardhan suggested that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could prove just as disruptive long term.

42426426,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJNcHh,1436892951,Deloitte Explores Blockchain Tech for Client Auditing,"Professional services firm Deloitte has revealed it is seeking to use blockchain technology to automate client auditing and crowdsource its consulting efforts, among other applications.  With the announcement, Deloitte – one of the world's 'Big Four' audit firms – becomes the latest mainstream financial entity to voice its interest in the technology, following announcements by banking giants such as Citi, UBS and USAA.  In an interview with CoinDesk, Deloitte Consulting principal Eric Piscini explained his company has been conducting research into the potential business opportunities around blockchain technology for 18 months.  He said:  ""We started with a very specific mandate ... as a 200,000-person company, we need to understand more about the blockchain and the underlying technology. We believe it can really change the way our clients operate and how we operate.""  Named the Deloitte Cryptocurrency Community (DCC), Piscini said the group has about 100 members in 12 countries. Its efforts have so far centered on communicating the potential benefits of the technology to banking and retail clients, while helping coordinate interactions between these entities and industry startups.  The DCC, he said, has three mandates: educate Deloitte and its clients on opportunities in the space, investigate how the technology could improve existing services and explore future solutions built on the blockchain.  The announcement follows written reports from Deloitte on various subjects including bitcoin's use as a money exchange protocol, a way to manage staff payments and the viability of a central bank-owned cryptocurrency.  Two camps  To date, many of Deloitte's clients are still in the exploratory phase of the technology, Piscini said, with most still attempting to determine the differences between bitcoin and other blockchains.  Some, however, are moving to apply this technology to specific pain points, either to add additional revenue streams or cut costs. Piscini suggests a smaller percentage of clients have graduated to explorations of how the technology could be applied to specific business use cases.  ""It's usually when they reach that third level that they start analyzing the technology stack and want to know how to deliver these businesses cases,"" he explained.  Piscini indicated that these clients are currently exploring different protocols built on top of bitcoin, including Blockstream, Counterparty and Factom. A key question that persists for many is whether to partner with these firms or build a private blockchain.  Alternative blockchains such as those managed by Ripple Labs or Ethereum are also being explored at this stage, he said.  ""We have clients on both sides of the equation, who say, 'We want to use factom, it's a good enough solution, they put an abstraction layer between me and the blockchain, I don't have to say that I'm using bitcoin, but I get the technology in the backend, the huge community, the huge mining network,"" he continued, adding:  ""Some people are saying I don't want to do anything with bitcoin, I'm going to go with Eris or Ethereum, because I don't want to be associated with bitcoin in any way. Those are the two camps.""  Piscini suggested Deloitte's New York banking clients, for example, were primarily interested in using the blockchain for the trade, transfer and settlement of transactions. Elsewhere, retail clients are interested in the use of the blockchain for rewards program management in a similar way as mobile gift card provider Gyft.  As for its own projects, Piscini said Deloitte hasn't determined one specific working thesis for the technology, suggesting the firm is willing to select the blockchain best for its specific use cases.  ""Our point of view, is 'Let's find use cases, where you can generate more revenue, generate a different customer experience or cut your costs.' Then we can find the technology stack to address them,"" he said.  Blockchain applications  So far, Deloitte has launched Rubix, a software platform that allows its clients to build applications on top of blockchain infrastructure.  The official website for the service lists four areas of interest, including reconsolidation between trading partners, real-time auditing, land registry and loyalty points. Internally, the company is focused on automating some of its auditing processing via a solution currently in stealth.  ""The solution we're developing using the blockchain will accelerate the audit process because that company would post every transaction in a blockchain. To audit a company, we would look at that blockchain and all the transactions but because the blockchain is immutable and time-stamped.""  ""It would accelerate the process and make it cheaper and more transparent and for regulators,"" he added.  Still, Piscini pushed back against the idea that the peer-to-peer (P2P) nature of blockchain technology will render service providers such as Deloitte obsolete.  ""The potential for disruption is limited, but the opportunity is significant. The example we had earlier is going to change the way we do that, but we don't think we'll be replaced, we think we can be more efficient,"" he said.  In regards to its tax services, Piscini said it would likely gain business due to the lack of clarity still surrounding the technology. Further, he also sees opportunity in consulting.  ""On the consulting side, I think we'll see the ecosystem adapt and change and move toward blockchain-based solutions,"" he continued. ""The potential for us is around the ability to source consulting services through a P2P crowdsourcing platform. Instead of saying, 'Deloitte help us with that strategy', you can request that service on the blockchain and the blockchain would match you with the right individuals to do that.""  Piscini added that this development is something the firm is ""taking very seriously"" given that consulting is increasingly an integral part of its operations.  Learning curve  Perhaps most notably given its vantage point as a mediator between startups and enterprise companies, Piscini suggested that these two communities have not yet developed steady communications.  More traditional companies, he said, still look at the tech community as ""geeks"" who may not understand the relevancy of the tech to their business. He also reported an equal but opposite reaction from startups.  ""A lot of those startups don't have as much training yet and they don't know how to talk business with my clients,"" he said. ""If you don't use the right terminology, you don't get to talk more than 10 minutes.""  So far, this has resulted in larger companies making some ""wrong assumptions"" about the technology. For example, Piscini noted that it is still not proven whether blockchains can replace shared databases and be more cost-efficient.  ""They're assuming that the blockchain is going fix a business or tech issue and they have some very high expectations. Sometimes we get back to them and say the blockchain will help you get there, but you should consider other options to fix that problem,"" Piscini said.  ""The blockchain is becoming such a big buzzword people are trying to fix everything with the blockchain where sometimes it doesn't make any sense.""  For example, Piscini cited cross-border payments as a vertical that will, long-term, likely embrace blockchain solutions, but that has compelling solutions today offering by companies such as Paypal and Xoom.  However, Piscini did express optimism that the dialogue is improving, spurred by the efforts of innovative firms such as Citi, JP Morgan and USAA, all of which have teams devoted to the technology, and the addition of financial industry veterans such as Blythe Masters to companies like Digital Asset Holdings.  ""The expertise is moving into the tech because that's how they're going to be able to come up with the right solutions, but it may take years to get to a mutual understanding,"" he added.  Identifying opportunity  Piscini also indicated that he still sees payments as being a vertical that will be influenced by bitcoin and the blockchain, even if enterprise clients are currently interested in the broader applications of the technology.  He suggested that, in Deloitte's view, bitcoin should be considered a technology for all transactions, including those that are not necessarily financial.  ""Bitcoin is a technology that is interesting when you want to manage any type of transactions, it could be a transaction between me and you transfering bitcoin or asking a driver to pick us up at an airport,"" he said. ""Today I'm using a ridesharing service, but tomorrow I might be using blockchain to do that.""  Over time, Piscini said he sees the blockchain becoming a foundational layer for asset transfer, smart contracts and voting, but that different blockchains may be created that specialize in each of these use cases. He also suggested that he sees cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin will likely continue to play a role in the management of blockchains.  While Deloitte is working on more than 20 use cases for the technology, Piscini still cautioned that he doesn't know which opportunity might be the most immediate application of the blockchain, though he foresees a killer app being developed soon.  Piscini concluded:  ""At some point, you're going to have a killer app, you're going to have the AOL of bitcoin that does it well for some time, that company is going to make a lot of money.""
