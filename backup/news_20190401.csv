42430346,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriBh,1554158705,Alt Season? Over 100 Crypto Assets Outperform Bitcoin in Q1 Surge,"The first quarter of 2019 was a breath of fresh air for the cryptocurrency market, having recorded its first quarterly increase in overall network valuations since the fourth quarter of 2017.  Interestingly, however, bitcoin is among the least significant price gainers so far this year while still flashing a noteworthy Q1 increase of 10 percent. What this means is that a sizable portion of the market’s recent growth came from the many other cryptocurrencies trading on exchanges today.  In fact, data from analytics provider Messari reveals that 118 cryptos increased more in price on a year-to-date basis than bitcoin, with several boasting triple-digit percent increases during that period.  As a result, the total network value of all cryptocurrencies – excluding bitcoin – came within 1 percent of suprassing that of bitcoin’s in March.  With Q1 of 2019 now in the history books, let's dive into some of the more notable individual performances by way of breaking down their respective asset size classes and market sectors.  Performances by asset size  There is a wide spectrum of assets, in the cryptocurrency market. These range from some of the biggest, like ethereum (close to $15 billion), to the smallest, like dancoin (DAN), which is worth just over $3 million. Hundreds of networks fall in between.  The table below depicts how Messari segments crypto-asset sizes into the four groups (large cap, medium cap, small cap and micro cap), as well their respective best and worst performers for the Q1 period.  While the highest-ranked cryptocurrencies in terms of asset size tend to be the most well-known coins in the industry (they trade with the most volume), data shows they are not always the strongest performers.  As can be seen, the top performers in both the medium and small-cap segments saw significantly better Q1 performances than the leader of the large-cap segment, binance coin (BNB), the price of which nearly tripled during that period.  Ravencoin's (RVN) performance surpassed all other medium cap cryptos, boasting a 386 percent increase in Q1, almost all of which was achieved in the month of March when its price jumped from the monthly open of $0.013 to its close of $0.061, according to data from Binance.  Pchain (PAI) was the best performer in the small-cap segment as well as the single strongest performer in the entire cryptocurrency market. PAI recorded a Q1 price increase of roughly 781 percent, Messari data reveals.  While many cryptocurrencies boasted double and even triple-digit gains in Q1, not all outperformed bitcoin or even finished the quarter with gains.  Bitcoin SV's (BSV) 26 percent loss and NEM's (XEM) 13 percent loss was enough to establish them as the worst performers in the large and medium cap segments, respectively, while the worst performer of the broader market was the small-cap crypto Grin (GRIN), which lost 70 percent of its value since its main-net launch on January 15.  It should be noted that market cap as a metric for valuing crypto-assets does have limitations not observed when used in traditional finance for valuing a publicly traded company. For example, lost bitcoins are technically accounted for in bitcoin's market capitalization, even though they are no longer part of the ""circulating"" supply and can never be spent.  This is not an issue when determining the market cap of a company since only outstanding and liquid shares are taken into account, leading cryptocurrency researchers to come up with alternative network valuation models like ""realized cap"", first proposed by Coinmetrics in 2018, that aims to account for such limitations.  Performances by sector  Another way to segment the cryptocurrency market is by sector, which describes the key parts of the crypto-economy.  Messari provides a number of different market sector classifications, the Q1 average and median performance of which are shown in the table below, and were calculated by taking the performance of the top 5 coins by market cap in each sector into account.  As can be seen, the ""Miscellaneous"" sector was the best performing sector in Q1 on average, but this was largely due to the fact the best and near 800 percent quarterly gainer Pchain (PAI) is included in the category.  Since PAI's growth significantly skews the average performance of the sector, the median which describes the true middle value of a given sector's quarterly performances, perhaps most honestly describes the sector with a more modest 52 percent median price increase.  The strongest sector in terms of median performance in Q1 were the coins intended to act as bridges between cryptocurrencies, making those networks interoperable. That list is comprised of names like Ontology (ONT), Chainlink (LINK) and Aion (AION). The sector finished Q1 with a 78 percent increase as the median performance.  In all, the top five cryptocurrencies by market cap in each sector averaged no worse than a 20 percent price increase.  Emergence above a key moving average  It’s one accomplishment to have a strong quarter. It’s another feat entirely for an asset to trade above its 200-day moving average.  Generally regarded to as the dividing line between a strong market and one that is not, the 200-day moving average is a technical hurdle that several top-ranked cryptocurrencies were able to climb above for the first time this quarter in nearly a year.  The last time CoinDesk conducted the same analysis on March 13, just four of the top 20 cryptocurrencies had both of its BTC and USD pairs trading above the 200 day moving average as signs of life in the market were just beginning to re-emerge.  Since then, however, four more cryptocurrencies joined the list, including Ontology (ONT), Tezos (XTZ), Cardano (ADA), and EOS (EOS) all of which now are trading with both pairs above the moving average. This indicates that a shift from bearish to bullish trends is on the rise.  Still lagging behind with neither trading pair above the MA are the first and third largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market cap, bitcoin (BTC) and XRP (XRP), as well as six others (not including USDT and Bitcoin SV, the latter of which has less than 200 days of trading history).  Renewed optimism  Indeed, Q1 was an impressive stretch for the cryptocurrency market, which has seemingly renewed optimism among some of its market participants.  On March 22, CoinDesk Markets conducted a Twitter poll to gauge the public's longer term outlook on the market leader bitcoin by asking what price it will trade closest to on the date of its next supply production halving event in May of 2020.  Interestingly, the most popular option was a value closest to $15,000, accumulating 47 percent of the 6,450 votes.  Currently priced around $4,000, that would mean the majority of those polled believe bitcoin will increase at least 275 percent or nearly quadruple its value in less than 14 months.

""It's primarily designed as an educational resource for customers to learn about the benefits of using crypto for cross-border payments,"" the representative said.      Coinbase appears to be offering a “fast and free” payments service for its users, according to the Coinbase website.  The exchange is using two cryptocurrencies for the service, XRP and USDC, the latter of which was launched last fall by Circle affiliate CENTRE. USDC was also the first stablecoin to be listed by Coinbase. XRP was added to Coinbase in late February, a move long sought by supporters of the Ripple-tied token.  Coinbase customers will have access to the no-fee service when sending to other users. Otherwise, Coinbase will charge ""a nominal on-chain network fee for sending outside of Coinbase.""  As the firm’s website explains:  “You can now send money to any user with a Coinbase account around the world using XRP or USDC. By using cryptocurrencies that are optimized for cross-border transmission, you can send and receive money virtually instantly by sending those cryptocurrencies and having the recipient convert them into local currency.”  On the page, Coinbase stresses that what’s being offered “is not a money remittance; rather, it is a cryptocurrency transaction with conversion into local currency after receipt.”  The company also notes that “in countries where Coinbase does not support the local currency, recipients need to transfer their XRP/USDC to an exchange that supports exchanges from XRP/USDC to local currency.”  Coinbase doesn’t seem to have made an official announcement regarding the service.

While the service seem primarily to serve bitcoin trades, Coincheck said it will consider trades in other cryptocurrencies.  Coincheck said its OTC trading desk will allow customers to buy and sell a minimum of 50 bitcoins ($205,423 at press time) “quickly” at one go and at “attractive prices.” The service is available on weekdays between 10 a.m. (13 UTC) and 3 p.m. (18 UTC) Japan time.  In an OTC trading service, two parties trade directly with each other, unlike on an exchange where orders are matched between buyers and sellers.  Coincheck suffered a $530 million hack in January 2018, losing around 500 million NEM tokens from its digital wallets. The exchange was then acquired by Japanese online brokerage Monex Group for $33.5 million in April last year.  The cyber-attack also forced Coincheck to suspend its services for some months. By November, however, it had reinstated services for all listed cryptos on its platform.  Coincheck has since received a regulatory license in Japan and is now a registered entity with the Kanto Financial Bureau under the country’s Payment Service Act. It's previously said it plans to resume other features, including leveraged transactions, Japanese yen depositing through convenience stores and a scheme that lets users pay utility bills with crypto.  A number of exchanges have recently moved to launch OTC trading services. Last week, the U.S. affiliate of the Huobi Global launched an institutional group for OTC cryptocurrency trading.

Announcing the news on Monday, ConsenSys Ventures said that the selected startups for the Tachyon 2.0 program are focused on building new blockchain-based solutions across data privacy, encryption, healthcare and decentralized finance, among other areas.  All 10 startups will benefit from the accelerator program, which includes meetings and lectures from “prominent” entrepreneurs, ethereum developers and venture capitalists, as well as access to ConsenSys’ network, according to the firm. The incubation efforts will take place in Berlin and San Francisco.  ConsenSys added that the German Bundestag, Germany's parliament, is holding a session today featuring talks on the different areas covered by ConsenSys, including early-stage startup incubation, legal, and marketing. It will also feature introductions from each of the teams in the accelerator.  German member of parliament Alexander Kulitz said in the announcement:  ""The best support a government can give to innovative entrepreneurs and startups is to avoid unnecessary and unneeded regulations. It is not up to the politicians to decide if a product or an entrepreneurial idea should be successful or not. The decision has to be made by the demand of the people on free economic markets. Politicians are only to guarantee a level playing field on free and fair markets.""  ConsenSys Ventures launched Tachyon as the first ethereum-focused accelerator program in June of last year, offering members of its first cohort benefits through its eight-week program.  The incubator confirmed Monday that each of the 10 members of the cohort will receive $100,000 as part of the accelerator.  ConsenSys Ventures’ managing partner Kavita Gupta said: “With the backing of the ConsenSys and Ethereum ecosystems, we aim to provide all the necessary tool-kits for our entrepreneurs to succeed both in the short term and in the long run.”  The selected startups are:  Blockchain-enabled DNA data bank Genomes  Energy market-focused blockchain startup Blok-Z  Protocol for self-sovereign identity Glimpse  Blockchain-backed data authenticity software maker Sensor.link  Litigation finance investment platform Lawcoin  Cryptocurrency security storage solutions provider Cypherock  Manufacturer of customized printed cryptocurrency cards Ether.cards  Smart contract and transaction security firm Sooho  Blockchain-based micro-insurance firm Ibisa  Open source protocol maker for including digital assets into links LinkDrop.

42430351,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriNh,1554120348,"Pakistan Introducing Regulations, Licensing Scheme for Crypto Firms","Pakistan is putting in place regulations for the cryptocurrency industry.  The Express Tribune, citing finance ministry sources, reported Monday that the nation's federal government has decided to bring in Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) regulations following recommendations from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  According to the new framework from the country's central bank, the State Bank of Pakistan, EMIs must meet certain requirements to be licensed by the country’s government, with firms that do not follow rules facing suspension or cancellation of licenses.  Companies would have to meet capital requirements, undergo scrutiny of executives, take measure to protect users' funds and carry out customer due diligence, including storing personal details such as name, ID card number, address and telephone number.  Pakistan is introducing the rules to encourage payments innovation and ""promote financial inclusion"" in the nation, the State Bank said in a statement.  A ceremony will be held at the Islamabad office of the State Bank of Pakistan Monday, to welcome in the new rules, The Express Tribune says.  FATF, a global money-laundering watchdog, has warned that cryptocurrency poses a risk for money laundering and terrorist financing several times in the past. The watchdog is also expected to publish rules for international cryptocurrency regulation by June.  The task force said last October that global jurisdictions will have to bring into force licensing schemes for crypto exchanges.

42430361,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMrifh,1554116424,Bitcoin Price Posts Biggest Quarterly Gain Since Late 2017,"View  Bitcoin closed the first quarter of 2019 with 10.91 percent gains – the biggest quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of 2017.  While bearish exhaustion is evident, a bullish reversal above $4,236 still remains elusive. A sustained break above that level may not happen in the next few months, as the price seems to be mimicking the bottoming pattern seen in nine months leading up to the October 2015 bull breakout.  Bitcoin's short-term outlook remains bullish as Friday's close above $4,055 bolstered the bullish setup on the daily chart. The cryptocurrency could test the February high of $4,190 this week.  However, a persistent failure to clear $4,130 – the high of a doji candle created on Saturday – may invite selling pressure and yield a drop to the crucial 30-day moving average, currently at $3,938.  Bitcoin made double-digit gains in the first three months of 2019, marking its best quarterly performance since Q4 2017.  The crypto market leader closed (UTC) yesterday at $4,096, representing a 10.91 percent gain on January's opening price of $3,693, according to Bitstamp data.  That is the first double-digit quarterly gain since the final three months of 2017 when prices had rallied a staggering 220.84 percent.  Back then, the bull market was raging on hopes that listing of bitcoin futures on major US exchanges would open the doors to the yield-hungry institutional investors. That, however, did not materialize and prices fell by 73.39 percent in 2018.  As can be seen, the latest double-digit quarterly gain has come after a prolonged bear market but looks more than the usual corrective bounce with prices mimicking the bottoming pattern seen before the 2015 bull breakout.  Further, a closer look at the monthly price action indicates the cryptocurrency is likely making a slow transition from a bearish to a bullish market.  January: Seller exhaustion  Bitcoin fell 7.59 percent in January, but the monthly high and low fell within the trading range of the previous month. Essentially, BTC created ""an inside month"" candle, a sign of bearish exhaustion.  February and March: Higher lows  BTC established a bullish higher low near $3,300 on the weekly chart in the first week of February and jumped to a high of $4,190 on Feb. 24.  The rise above $4,000, however, was short-lived and prices fell back to 3,600 at the end of February. BTC had charted its way back to $4,100 by the end of March with multiple bullish higher lows along the 30-day moving average.  The bearish exhaustion followed by a steady stream of higher lows has raised hopes of BTC confirming a bull breakout with a move above $4,236 (Dec. 24 high).  However, if history is any guide, then a sustained break above $4,236 may not happen for a few more months. It is worth noting that the bullish breakout seen in October 2015 was preceded by a nine-month period of consolidation.  In the short-term, the path of least resistance appears to be on the higher side. As of writing, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $4,122 on Bistamp – up 0.82 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Weekly and daily chart  As seen on the weekly chart (above left), BTC created a bullish engulfing candle last week, reinforcing the bullish view put forward by the ascending 5- and 10-week moving averages (MAs).  On the daily chart (above right), BTC created a bullish higher low along the 30-day MA on March 25 and closed well above $4,055 on Friday. That strengthened the bullish case put forward by the upward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs, the bullish crossover of the 50- and 100-day MAs and the long-tailed doji created on Feb. 27.  As a result, BTC look set to test the Feb. 24 high of $4,190.  Even so, there is merit in being cautious, as the cryptocurrency created a doji candle on Saturday – a sign of bullish exhaustion – and so far, the cryptocurrency has struggled to find acceptance above $4,130 (doji candle high).  A persistent failure to convincingly scale $4,130 would weaken the bullish case and could yield a pullback to the 30-day MA, currently at $3,938.

42430353,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriRh,1554109219,"Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin Futures Volumes Top $150 Million at Kraken Exchange","It's not just bitcoin futures products that are becoming popular with investors, at least according to one U.K.-based crypto derivatives provider.  Crypto Facilities, a subsidiary of the San Francisco-based exchange Kraken that provides bitcoin and ether reference data for CME Group and has offered its own derivatives products for years, has seen trading volume in its altcoin futures markets jump dramatically in recent weeks – in particular, its litecoin and bitcoin cash futures contracts, said head of indices and pricing products Sui Chung.  He told CoinDesk that the company had seen a dedicated following for each coin since litecoin was listed in June 2018 and bitcoin cash two months later, ""but relative to bitcoin and ether [those contracts] were pretty small in terms of volume.""  This changed after Kraken acquired the startup earlier this year.  ""We began to onboard Kraken users ... [and] that's basically given us better exposure to the communities around litecoin and bitcoin cash, and I think what we're seeing is those communities have a pretty strong interest in trading derivatives for litecoin and bitcoin cash, respectively,"" Chung said. ""The volumes have gone up pretty appreciably.""  Prior to the acquisition, Crypto Facilities saw its litecoin futures contracts average around $15 million in notional volume each month, while its bitcoin cash contracts saw roughly $10 million per month.  By contrast, last month, the litecoin product saw $100 million notional volume, while bitcoin cash was just under $50 million, Chung said.  Settled in crypto  Chung does not think that Kraken's userbase is the sole contributor to the increasing volumes, but rather just one of a number of factors.  In particular, he stressed that Crypto Facilities is one of the few – if not only – exchanges that offer regulated altcoin futures contracts that pay out in the underlying cryptocurrencies. Speaking to litecoin and bitcoin cash specifically, Chung believes that there was some pent-up demand for such regulated contracts (Crypto Facilities is regulated by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority).  While these futures are cash-settled, both sides of the transaction are paid up in the base asset. As a result, buyers are delivered the actual cryptocurrency when the contracts expire, unlike the cash-settled bitcoin futures of the Chicago exchanges CME and Cboe, which pay fiat.  ""I think there was always demand from those communities for a strong derivatives contract that is collateralized and paid out in that coin because there are contracts in other markets … where the base asset is litecoin but they pay out in bitcoin,"" he said. ""Our contracts are paid out in litecoin and bitcoin cash.""  He cited BitMEX, which offers a number of crypto futures products, as one platform which settles in bitcoin (a spokesperson for BitMEX confirmed that all deposits to, and withdrawals from the startup's wallets are in bitcoin).  Chung added:  ""I think the broad trend we’re seeing is ... there’s obviously demand for regulated futures contracts for crypto that is denominated and paid out in crypto.""  The litecoin and bitcoin cash communities ""have an appetite for trading derivatives,"" he said.  The lonely outlier  Volume boosts aside, not all altcoin futures are exploding. In particular, the demand for XRP futures has remained relatively stable, despite the outpouring of support for litecoin and bitcoin cash, Chung said.  ""XRP has been pretty steady, it’s always accounted for about between 5 and 10 percent of our market and that hasn’t changed,"" he said, explaining:  ""Interestingly, that hasn’t really changed [from] before the acquisition, post acquisition, in all the time we’ve had that contract … [the acquisition] hasn’t seemed to have affected that.""  This does not mean that XRP contracts are losing market share or dropping in volume. The raw numbers for Crypto Facilities' products are increasing across the board. However, XRP futures' volume is not growing as quickly as litecoin and bitcoin cash futures.  By process of elimination, that means bitcoin and ether futures contracts are losing market share, even as their volume grows. More traders are onboarding and bringing new liquidity to Crypto Facilities' products, ""but [volume is] not increasing at such a dramatic rate, market volatility is subdued,"" he said.  In fact, Crypto Facilities saw its overall trading volume jump some 500 percent, nearing $1 billion traded across its various contracts in just the first month after Kraken acquired the platform.  Growth potential  If Kraken's user base spurred Crypto Facilities' recent growth, its future may well come from an influx of institutional capital, Chung said.  In recent weeks and months, the company has been contacted by various funds and other major firms looking to dip their toes into the crypto derivatives market. ""I think we can say there’s heightened interest … from traditional financial institutions,"" Chung said.  Market makers, brokers and other firms interested in bringing crypto derivatives products to their clients have begun reaching out to discuss participating in Crypto Facilities' markets, he said.  And while preliminary, their interest is serious, Chung said, explaining:  ""These institutions are in the early stages of exploring this, but at the same time I think the interest we’ve seen are coming from, it’s not driven by hype, it’s not as if the price is going up [or] doubling every month. It’s more considered than previous waves of inquiry.""  These companies have researched what processes and infrastructure they would need to develop in order to become more involved in the crypto space, he said.  ""They’ve done a lot more homework about what it means to be involved in crypto,"" Chung said. ""The interest is not driven by the prospect of crypto doubling in price every morning, it’s driven more by them saying ‘hey there’s a market here.'""  That being said, institutions are not about to jump head-first into the space just yet. Chung said the firms which have expressed interest are still evaluating the risks, so that when they do enter, it is in a more controlled manner than entrants at the peak of the last bull run.  ""It’s much more considered than the interest that we once saw in early 2018,"" he said.  UPDATE (April 1, 15:45 UTC): This article was updated to correct the categorization of Crypto Facilities' altcoin futures. They are technically cash-settled, even though the contracts pay crypto.

42430357,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMriXh,1554093661,"Police Freeze Accounts, Seize Luxury Cars in Probe of ICO Promoter Vanbex","Canadian police have frozen assets owned by the founders of blockchain services company Vanbex, as part of a fraud investigation into a 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) that raised $22 million.  According to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, the company, led by Kevin Hobbs and Lisa Cheng, raised $30 million CAD (about $22 million) worth of fiat and cryptocurrency through the sale of a token called FUEL.  Vanbex told investors that the token would be usable in a forthcoming smart contract system called Etherparty, and that ""the value of the FUEL token would increase dramatically,"" says the civil forfeiture action filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.  However, Vanbex ""developed no usable products"" and Hobbs and Cheng ""did not intend to develop the products they were marketing but rather [acted] with [the] intention to misappropriate the corporately invested funds raised for their own personal benefit,"" according to a filing by the director of civil forfeiture at Canada's Ministry of Attorney General.  ""FUEL tokens became virtually worthless in dollar value while not being capable of use in the non-existent smart contracts system or for any product or service other than a cryptocurrency coin creating service called Rocket,"" which was different than what the purchasers were promised, the director claimed.  No criminal charges have been filed so far, and when reached by CoinDesk on Sunday evening, Cheng and Hobbs denied the fraud charges and said Vanbex is cooperating with the investigation.  But in response to the government's application, Justice J.A. Power on March 14 authorized the government to seize the founders' two Land Rovers; ordered Bank of Montreal to freeze Hobbs' two accounts there containing slightly less than $1 million; and ordered him and Cheng not to sell, borrow against or damage their Vancouver condominium for at least 30 days, court papers show.  Vanbex's response  In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Hobbs and Cheng called the fraud allegations “false,” and said that the investigations were the result of “false claims by a former contractor.”  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) began investigating Vanbex and its founders for fraud in May 2018 and the Canadian Revenue Agency subsequently began a tax probe, according to the filing.  The founders denied that they made any promises about the value of FUEL tokens, saying “the tokens integrate bitcoin and Ethereum and the value of any currency is beyond any company or individual’s control, obviously. … Fuel tokens pay for transaction fees on the network for Smart Contracts deployed through our architecture.”  Vanbex’s business accounts have not been frozen, they added.  They took issue with the government’s characterization of Vanbex in court papers as a shell company. “Vanbex is an operating company, which is easy to establish,” they said, adding that they have been in the crypto space since 2013.  Further, Hobbs and Cheng took issue with the authorities’ claim that Vanbex produced no usable products. “We have had more than 50 clients” – not two, as the court documents allege – “and we have two excellent products.”  'High roller'  Still, the court papers go on to allege that Hobbs and Cheng “acquired sudden and substantial personal wealth” around the time of the ICO, purchasing two condominiums – the one in Vancouver, another in Toronto – for about $3 million each and the two Land Rovers, and leasing a Lamborghini worth $375,000 for a three-year term.  Further, Hobbs spent some of the misappropriated funds on gambling “domestically and internationally at the high roller level,” according to one of the filings.  From September 2016 to March 2018, he withdrew a total of $1.3 million from casinos in British Columbia, one document alleges. In November 2017, the state-owned British Columbia Lottery Corporation put Hobbs on a “watch list,” preventing him from buying in at any of its casinos without proof of the source of his funds.  When Hobbs and Cheng became aware of the investigation, they started attempting to liquidate their assets, taking out mortgages against the condos and putting one of them up for sale, the document claims.  Addressing this, Cheng and Hobbs told CoinDesk they borrowed the money to inject into the business.  Regarding the gambling, they told CoinDesk that Hobbs “has been a professional poker player in the past and has participated in poker tournaments around the world,"" and ""has never been prevented from [playing at] any casino.”  The court papers also note that Hobbs has a criminal record in Canada. He was convicted of possessing criminally obtained property and money laundering in 2008, for which was sentenced to nine months, and growing and trafficking in marijuana in 2009, for which he was sentenced to 30 months, the documents say.  In addition, he was busted for possession of pot in New York in 2005, for which he was given a one-year sentence, the Canadian government said.  Cooperation ongoing  Employees have been “encouraged to cooperate fully with the investigation and they are,” Hobbs and Cheng told CoinDesk.  “We remain confident that the truth will prevail, and this will be behind us soon,” they said.  “Unfortunately, these things move at a pace beyond our control. In the meantime, we will continue to innovate and deliver quality products. Our counsel are working to put this astern in a fashion that decisively confirms our leading role in this industry, which we intend to maintain.”  They concluded by telling stakeholders:  “Thank you for your loyalty and trust. It is not misplaced.”    Vanbex civil forfeiture order by CoinDesk on Scribd    UPDATE (April 1, 05:35 UTC): This article has been updated to correct a passage about the leased Lamborghini. $375,000 USD is the total value of the car according to the court documents, not the monthly rate of the lease, which has a three-year term.
