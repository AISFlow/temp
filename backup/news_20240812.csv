32342707,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634953,1723503605,Ethereum Leads The Charge as Weekly Crypto Inflows Hit $176M—CoinShares,"Latest data from crypto asset manager CoinShares has shown a noticeable comeback in the crypto market. In its latest ‘digital asset fund flows weekly report,’ the asset manager revealed that last week marked a significant uptick in investor confidence, as digital asset investment products saw $176 million in inflows. According to James Butterfill, head of research at CoinShares, this surge in inflow signals a strong, “unanimous” positive sentiment across the board, with particular attention to Ethereum-based funds. Related Reading: $0 Flows: BlackRock Unshaken Despite Recent Bitcoin Market Crash, Data Shows Dissecting The Crypto Fund Flows Delving into the report, Butterfill revealed that Ethereum products have “distinctly” stood out, attracting $155 million of the total inflows, the highest year-to-date intake since 2021. This influx highlights the market’s renewed interest in Ethereum, especially with the recent introduction of spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, according to Butterfill. Notably, the successful live trading of these funds has not only boosted Ethereum’s position in the global crypto market but also appears to have played a pivotal role in the overall increase in its market cap and investment product offerings. As for Bitcoin, Butterfill revealed in the report that despite seeing outflows earlier in the week, Bitcoin could still end the week with a positive total inflow of approximately $13 million. On the other hand, Short Bitcoin ETPs, as reported, “saw their largest outflows since May 2023, totaling $16m (23% of AuM), reducing AuM for short positions to its lowest level since the start of the year, indicating a substantial investor exit.” Furthermore, Coinshares disclosed that despite the initial volatility, the overall market sentiment has been “overwhelmingly” positive. The report highlights that the inflows weren’t just isolated incidents but part of a broader, global positive reception to digital assets. Notably, regions such as the United States, Switzerland, Brazil, and Canada have been front runners, injecting substantial capital into the market. It is worth noting that this global participation in inflows highlights a collective bullish outlook despite previous major dips. Market Performances: ETH And BTC Bitcoin and Ethereum are struggling to defeat the bears, with both assets still maintaining their price mark above major key levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Weakens: Can It Defend the $2,500 Level? For instance, Ethereum still trades above $2,500 at the time of writing, with a current trading price of $2,689. This price mark comes against the asset’s notable increase of more than 11% in the past week and the extended bullishness of a 1.6% surge in the past day. Bitcoin has also seen quite a surge in the past week, increasing by 11.4%. Although the asset has witnessed a decline of 0.4% in the past day, it is still maintaining its price below $60,000.

32340388,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634935,1723498200,Polkadot (DOT) Seen Reversing Losses With 116% Rally To $10 – Analyst,"Polkadot token DOT has indeed been hot on the cryptocurrency market throughout the week, appreciating over 21%. Despite the gains bringing further enthusiasm among the investors, the token pressed on higher and continues to trade at $4.65 with a market capitalization of more than $6.6 billion. Now ranking 17th in the largest cryptocurrencies, investors and DOT aficionados cannot stop wondering if it can sustain its momentum. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Up 23% As Developments Spark Investor Interest Something is literally now hyping in the air, particularly after the analysis of the popular crypto analyst known as “Zayk Charts.” The analyst observed a falling wedge pattern on the 2-day chart for DOT/USDT, and it could truly be a game-changer. $DOT Falling Wedge Formation in 2D Timeframe✅ Incase of Breakout,Next Target wil be $10📈#DOT #DOTUSDT #Polkadot #Crypto pic.twitter.com/xgqyjAN4ul — ZAYK Charts (@ZAYKCharts) August 11, 2024 This is usually a bullish sign and gets more than 70% ripeness for triggering a trend reversal of the negative variety. If DOT breaks out of this wedge, Zayk Charts predicts it could shoot straight up and target a price as high as $10. Polkadot ‘Greed’ Factor While the technical analysis looks good for DOT, when we overlay the sentiment, it only makes things more complex. Polkadot’s Fear and Greed Index recently shifted into a “Greed” phase. What does it mean? In plain words, investors are getting excited—maybe a little too excited. The “Greed” phase usually means that it is creating an irrational stage in bullish investors’ minds, where they just think prices are to go up and never go down. While being great for short-term gains, there’s a catch. Too much greed inflates prices higher than they are truly worth, hence creating a bubble. While the “Greed” period, of course, introduces on the radar screen strong market performance, it also carries with it red flags toward a possible market correction. In short, would we have to face a bubble, or is it just the beginning of an upward long-term trend? Technical Analysis: Falling Wedge And Breakout Potential Back to the technical front. The falling wedge pattern is very important, and Zayk Charts marks it accordingly. Technically, this pattern is known to be a bullish reversal pattern. It forms when the price of a coin trades lower but with the rate of decline decreasing, which then results in the formation of a converging trend line. A breakout from this pattern usually results in a massive price increase. Breaking out of this wedge could be the key to $10 for DOT, which means a 116% increase for the altcoin. That would be a huge comeback for the cryptocurrency, a move that would easily regain investors’ confidence and re-cement Polkadot’s status as a force to reckon within the market. Like any other prediction done in the highly unpredictable world of crypto, however, this also comes with no guarantees. Related Reading: Fantom (FTM) Poised For Massive Bull Run, Analyst’s 234% Rally Prediction Raises Eyebrows Price Forecast And Investor Outlook On a broader perspective, DOT still hovers with very positive sentiments. According to data from CoinCheckup, the DOT token is poised for an upsurge in strength. The platform gave a forecast that, in the coming three months, it would climb up by 245%. Should such an event ensue, this would be a massive comeback for the token. But that’s not all. In the coming six months, Polkadot is projected to climb 180%, and in a one-year time span, it is expected to rise 166%.

42417472,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVrB,1723495575,What I Learned About Crypto’s Future From Basecamp and FWBFest,"In the mountains of Idyllwild, CA, a convergence of technologists, artists, and optimists surrendered themselves to the future. I had the opportunity to spend two recent days at Basecamp, Base’s summer retreat, followed by two more at FWB FEST (Friends With Benefits’ annual gathering), where around 1,000 attendees enjoyed music, art, and ideas while exploring the frontiers of on-chain technology and culture. These experiences provided me with insights about the future of blockchains. Here are my six key takeaways.  Subculture-market-fit in blockchains  These events validated a thesis I have grown to believe: mass adoption of blockchains will emerge when people outside the current crypto community use our tools to create or supplement their own niches. This concept hinges on new adopters using blockchains to spread value and secure trust within their own communities, just as the initial crypto cohort has done. New adopters won’t join a single monolithic onchain community; instead, they’ll perhaps create their own. Despite these diverse creations, we’ll all remain connected by the underlying blockchain, making ""onchain"" a verb for human connection.  Interestingly, the social layer of crypto inherits more from the protocol layer than we often realize. Just as our codebases begin to exhibit modularity, our cultural bases will too, this is because building modular expands the scope of what can be built in the first place, thus inviting more contributors.  This core principle of blockchains allows individuals to join whichever subculture they prefer without being detached from the whole. In a world increasingly divided, the shared global ledgers of blockchains keep us connected. I look forward to seeing more modularity in both cultural and technical terms emerges as sprouts within broad ecosystems like Ethereum.  For a deeper dive into this idea of subcultures, I recommend Paul Dylan Ennis’ article for CoinDesk.  Interoperability is the word of 2024  When gathering people from all walks of crypto, one topic stands out: user experience, which is closely tied to the concept of interoperability.  Interoperability is defined in the dictionary as:  The ability of computer systems or software to exchange and use information.  The ability of military equipment or groups to operate in conjunction with each other.  Both definitions resonate with blockchains. From a technical standpoint, interoperability allows different systems, protocols, and applications to exchange and utilize information seamlessly. Imagine navigating blockchains as effortlessly as switching websites without changing your WiFi router.  Social layer interoperability, on the other hand, facilitates coordination and collaboration among diverse groups within the space. It ensures that different user groups — developers, artists, investors, community builders — can work together harmoniously, compounding their efforts to build something truly special and lasting.  Thus, interoperability in blockchains enables seamless transfer and deployment of various types of capital: financial, technical, cultural, and human. It allows chains, apps, and people to collaborate, making the interoperable whole greater than the sum of its parts.  Opinionated blockspace is on the rise  During a Superchain panel at FWB fest with BASE, Optimism and Worldcoin, Tiago Sada, Head of Product at Worldcoin, noted that “there will be neutral block space, and there will also be opinionated block space.”  Opinionated blockspace means fewer copy-paste apps and more novel innovations and Interoperability allows for maximum composability across diverse, opinionated blockchains. Previously siloed opinions can now coexist and compound in open gardens or, as the Optimism collective envisions, in one big superchain.  The need for neutral ground  Magic happens when different skill sets come together. Basecamp and FWBFest were demonstrations of such convergences. At these events, we saw companies work together to compound their experiences and provide greater value to the end user – different companies / protocols helping each other and not feeling territorial, it was a joy to witness.  Leaders like Jesse Pollak, Base’s first contributor, embody the synergy that can exist across different walks of crypto. His dual expertise as a community builder and protocol leader has translated into success for Base. While not everyone needs to be Jesse (he is a 1of1), many in crypto can find similar success by merging or empowering both worlds.  While specialized conferences (NFT conferences, hackathons, institutional conferences) are essential, generalized open spaces where builders, artists, users, and hobbyists alike can mingle are equally important. We need more neutral spaces like Basecamp and FEST to happen more consistently, both online and IRL.  Culture is a lived experience  Words can mimic but never truly replicate experiences. Meeting people at these events was a joy, and I found myself pondering, “What does culture mean anyway?” Reflecting on this, I realized culture is a lived experience among groups of humans, and I am grateful to have felt it.  The challenge now is scaling this culture. My excitement for decentralized social networks lies in their potential to replicate this sense of community onchain, forging trusted, global and spontaneous lifelong connections.  To truly scale this culture, we need more of the on-chain world to resonate with the experiences we've cherished in the Web2 space — those concerts, coffee meetups, and late-night conversations that have shaped our lives. These moments of connection are the bedrock of culture, and Web3 should strive to capture that same essence, seamlessly intertwining the physical and digital worlds.  The beauty of being on-chain lies in its ability to unite us with an underlying technology that enhances rather than overshadows these experiences, making every interaction feel meaningful and authentic. By bringing the spontaneity and intimacy of our Web2 experiences into the on-chain realm, we can create a vibrant, lived culture that feels as natural as the ones we've always known.  The value of tough questions  One underappreciated aspect of events with multiple curators is the tougher questions that often arise. This is not only healthy for the industry’s progress but also for our own. We should use difficult questions as launch pads for reflection.  Why is adoption so low when the tools are incredibly strong?  Are we building things that people actually want?  Are we incorporating people’s feedback into our products?  How can we make DAOs more inclusive?  Events that do not just converge around panels and pre-set interviews, but rather open up the floor to audiences to discuss and question things openly are an important vehicle to drive future success; these spaces allow everyone to become a stakeholder in the future of crypto.  As we move forward, the lessons from Basecamp and FWBFest underline a crucial truth: the future of crypto hinges on inclusivity, collaboration, and continuous dialogue. By fostering environments where diverse ideas and perspectives can flourish, we can build a blockchain ecosystem that is not only technically robust but also rich in culture and human connection. Let’s embrace this journey together, ensuring that every voice is heard and every innovation is celebrated. Decentralized systems can benefit greatly by listening to the people they are decentralizing unto, and it is lovely to see progress being made on that front through such events.  –  If you would like to connect with Binji, you can find him on X or Farcaster.

32338407,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634873,1723492807,"Ethereum Return To $4,000: Key Zones And Price Levels To Watch","Ethereum has struggled greatly underneath the bearish pressure that has been mounted on the crypto market over the last few weeks. The ETH price suffered multiple crashes that sent it toward $2,000 once more, shattering the expectations for a new all-time high in the third quarter. However, this decline may only be short-lived as one crypto analyst has suggested that the Ethereum price could be getting ready for another rally that could push it toward its previous highs. Ethereum Looking Promising On 1-Week Chart Crypto analyst RLinda has posted a promising analysis on the Ethereum price on the TradingView website. This analysis focuses on the ETH price on the one-week chart, which has maintained bullishness despite the crash. This follows the continuous accumulation from the low $2,000s level as the price recovers. Related Reading: Bitcoin Exchange Outflows Soar To Yearly High – Could This Fuel A Return To $70,000? The crypto analyst highlights that Ethereum is seeing buyback from the market following the crash. This suggests bullishness among investors despite the price remaining low at this point. As for the chart, the analyst points out that “a very promising technical situation is forming on W1.” RLinda proposes that there could be a number of promising conditions forming if the ETH price were to return to its global sideways range. In this case, the crypto analyst believes that Ethereum could be seeing a good cause to jump toward the $4,000-$4,800 range. Amid all of this, the crypto analyst maintains that the background for Ethereum is still quite bullish. “The liquidation (strong downward movement) and the subsequent active buyback indicates that the market is free of unnecessary traders and the train can now move in the right direction, it remains to get to the key station before departure,” RLinda stated. Key Levels To Watch The Ethereum price being bullish is positive for the cryptocurrency. However, there are still various important levels to watch that serve as important levels for the cryptocurrency to achieve this goal. This includes both support and resistance levels along the way. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against Tether In $2.4 Bitcoin Collateral Controversy In this case, RLinda places significant attention not he $2,717-$2,817 resistance area. Mainly, these areas serve as the most important resistance levels in this drive upward.

A full rundown of the resistance levels is $2,717 and $2,817, while the major support levels from here include $2,518, $2,425, and $2,400. RLinda believes that the whales’ Ethereum buyback shows that major players are still bullish. “After Friday’s test and pullback, the price is back to the level, which increases the chances of a breakout,” the crypto analyst said in closing.

42417461,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVfp,1723492157,VCs Show 'Flight to Quality' in Q2 Funding Report,"Venture capitalists made fewer crypto deals last quarter, but enthusiasm for the sector remains high, according to a new quarterly report from PitchBook.  Overall, crypto fundraising rose 2.5% to $2.7 billion across 503 deals in Q1. Although the dollar amount was up, the number of deals fell 12.5%.  “Investors are concentrating capital into a smaller range of opportunities,” Robert Le, PitchBook’s senior analyst for emerging technology, told CoinDesk in an interview. “There’s a flight to quality. A few years ago, their investments were more spread out across the space.”  Le said this increased focus continued a trend seen in the data for the past year.  The biggest deals in Q2 were for layer-1 platform Monad ($225.0 million Series A), layer-1 platform Berachain ($100.0 million Series B) and bitcoin restaking platform Babylon ($70.0 million early-stage round). Farcaster, the decentralized social network, brought in $150 million (Series A) and blockchain-based gaming platform Zentry raised $140 million in an early-stage round. The biggest volume of fundraising went to infrastructure, including scaling and financial services.  Le said he expected 2024’s overall fundraising to be up 20% or more on last year. He forecasts $12-$14 billion for the year, compared to about $10 billion last year.  Blockchain networks are likely to undergo a period of consolidation, though not in a way that’s common in other industries, where mergers & acquisitions lead to less organizations over time. There are currently more than 150 layer 1s and layer 2s operating, and it’s unlikely that all of these projects can be viable in the long-term. Le expects three to five blockchains to host most of the developer and user activity.  “There are way too many L1s and L2s. Solana, Bitcoin, Optimism, Arbitrum and Base: those are the winners,” he said.  Most of the projects will become “zombie chains” with few real users (as opposed to bot-driven transactions).  DePIN, or decentralized physical infrastructure, could be one of the standout sectors of this cycle, because of its appeal to non-native crypto users, according to the PitchBook analyst. “DePIN is going to be one of the strongest narratives, maybe the strongest,"" he said. ""There are so many narratives in previous cycles that were all about crypto native users. With DePIN, you see a lot of activity with non-native users.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | SOL | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Benjamin Schiller,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/coindesk-news/2024/08/12/vcs-show-flight-to-quality-in-q2-funding-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f29bbb46d3862ef3478e8bb670f0fe036f9b7c79-1019x573.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417455,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVXZ,1723490652,"SEC Files Fraud Charges Against Promoters of NovaTech, Alleged $650M Crypto Pyramid Scheme","The U.S. SEC has filed a lawsuit against a crypto pyramid scheme and its operators. The regulator says they stole $650 million from 200,000 investors around the world.  NovaTech largely preyed on affinity groups, including Haitian-American churchgoers via WhatsApp groups and promotional events.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed suit against an alleged crypto pyramid scheme, NovaTech, and eight of its promoters on Monday, charging them with fraud and multiple violations of federal securities laws.  NovaTech allegedly scammed investors out of around $650 million over a four-year period, the SEC said in its filing. The lawsuit comes two months after New York Attorney General Letitia James filed suit against NovaTech, its founders, and another alleged pyramid scheme with ties to NovaTech.  Read more: NYAG Sues 2 Crypto Pyramid Schemes, Promoters Targeting Haitian-Americans in $1B Scam  According to the SEC’s complaint, NovaTech and its promoters preyed on certain affinity groups – largely, Haitian Creole-speaking churchgoers in the U.S. and abroad – via WhatsApp groups and promotional events, convincing over 200,000 investors around the world to fork over a collective $650 million between June 2019 and May 2023, when the scheme collapsed.  The company’s founders, American married couple Cynthia and Eddy Petion, who are now believed to be living in Panama, and promoters – including Martin Zizi, James Corbett, Corrie Sampson, Dapilinu Dunbar, John Garofano and Marsha Hadley, all named defendants in the SEC’s lawsuit – used “religious overtones” when soliciting investors. Cynthia Petion dubbed herself the “Reverend CEO” in NovaTech promotional materials and on her social media profiles, and claimed that God sent her a “vision” of starting the company while she was brushing her teeth.  NovaTech’s would-be investors believed that their investments would be pooled and then traded in the crypto and foreign exchange markets. NovaTech’s marketing materials promised investors 2-3% returns per week, according to the SEC, and purportedly never posted a weekly trading loss.  But according to the SEC, only a small fraction of investors’ money was ever actually invested – and the money that was invested suffered “significant trading losses.” Instead, the Petions and their employees allegedly operated a Ponzi scheme, using new investors’ money to make payments to earlier investors. They also allegedly transferred millions of dollars of investor funds to themselves.  The scheme began to unravel in October 2022, as investors began to experience significant delays when attempting to withdraw their funds from the site. Shortly after the withdrawal troubles began, several state securities regulators in the U.S. and Canada issued cease-and-desist orders against NovaTech. By May 2023, the Petions shut down NovaTech and took its website offline, leaving the remaining investors unable to withdraw their funds.  The SEC’s complaint is alleging that NovaTech and the Petions violated the anti-fraud and securities-registration provisions of the federal securities laws. The assorted promoter defendants are accused of violating the antifraud, securities-registration and broker-registrations provisions of the federal securities laws.  The SEC is seeking permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties.  One defendant, Martin Zizi, has already agreed to a partial settlement. Without admitting or denying the charges against him, Zizi agreed to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and to be permanently enjoined from future securities violations.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Suggests Market Now Extremely Fearful The “Fear & Greed Index” is an indicator created by Alternative that tells us about the average sentiment that’s currently present in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. The index uses the following five factors to determine the sentiment: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends. It then represents this estimation using a scale that runs from 0-100 Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes Sharp Recovery, But Watch Out For Resistance At $64,000 All values of the indicator beyond the 53 mark imply that investors are showing greed, while those below 47 suggest the presence of fear in the market. The region between these two cutoffs naturally corresponds to a neutral mentality. Besides these three territories, there are also two special sentiments called the extreme fear and the extreme greed. The former of these occurs at 25 and below, while the latter at 75 and above. Now, here is what the latest value of the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index looks like: As is visible above, the indicator has a value of 25 at the moment, meaning that the market is just inside the extreme fear zone. This is a pretty significant change from how the metric was just yesterday. The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index over the past month. From the graph, it’s apparent that the Fear & Greed Index had been at a high level near the end of July, but during the bearish momentum that had followed in the BTC price, the metric’s value had also gone through a notable drop. On the 29th, the index was at a value of 74, meaning it was right on the edge of extreme greed, but by the 6th of this month, it had gone into the extreme fear zone with a value of 17. The asset’s recent recovery did lead to an improvement to the sentiment, with the index traveling back up to 48. It would appear, though, that this growth couldn’t last, as the sentiment has again declined into extreme fear, as the BTC price has seen a retrace. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Gives Bottom Signal: What Happened Last 2 Times The fact that the sentiment has worsened, however, may not actually be a bad sign for the cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin has tended to move against the expectations of the majority, and the extreme regions are where this expectation is perhaps the strongest. As such, tops and bottoms have tended to form whenever the market has been inside these zones. With the Fear & Greed Index now back inside extreme fear, It’s possible that a bottom could be likely to take place. It now remains to be seen if the asset’s decline ends with this drop, or if there is more to come. BTC Price Bitcoin appears to already be showing signs of a rebound as its price has climbed back up to $59,700 from its low of under $58,000 earlier in the day.

32334192,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634892,1723482036,Crypto Analyst Reveals Best Altcoins To Buy After This Crash,"In the wake of the market crash of recent weeks, crypto analyst Michaël van der Poppe has provided an analysis of the trajectory of Bitcoin and its impact on altcoins. His remarks centered around Bitcoin dominance and the readiness of the altcoin markets, especially in sectors like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and decentralized finance (DeFi), for a potential rebound and significant growth. Van der Poppe started his analysis by discussing Bitcoin dominance, a metric that reflects Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the entire crypto market. The analyst noted that contrary to popular belief, the current state of Bitcoin dominance does not herald the beginning of a bear market. “Bitcoin dominance is not at the start of a bear market but it is at the end of the bear market and potentially the start of a bull market,” he stated. This observation is critical as it suggests that Bitcoin’s market sway is stabilizing, potentially setting the stage for an altcoin rally and capital flows into low-cap cryptocurrencies. Best Altcoins To Buy Now Focusing on strategic investment opportunities post-crash, Van der Poppe underscored the importance of selecting altcoins based on sector strength and market recovery potential. He pointed out that AI and DeFi are two sectors where growth could be most explosive due to underlying technological advancements and increased use cases. Within these sectors, he identified specific tokens that exhibit characteristics of resilience and high growth potential. #1 TAO TAO, a token within the AI sector, is highlighted by van der Poppe for its robust performance in recent weeks, showing a remarkable 70% rebound from its lows. “TAO is a super strong asset within the AI sector and has shown a 70% bounce from its lows,” he noted. Related Reading: SUI Leads Crypto Market With 78% Weekly Uptick: Here’s Why This rebound is significant as it reflects growing investor interest and confidence in AI technologies within the blockchain space. Van der Poppe projected an optimistic future for TAO, suggesting, “This is one that could be doing another 5x to 10x from here,” based on its current trajectory and market interest. #2 AAVE Shifting his focus to the DeFi sector, Van der Poppe recommended AAVE, a token that has shown significant strength against Bitcoin and USDT. “AAVE is having a pretty standard or beautiful accumulation against Bitcoin; it’s making new highs against USDT and just consolidating before a big breakout.” He emphasized the relative undervaluation of AAVE by comparing its total value locked (TVL) to its market cap. “If we look at TVL versus the market cap, then the market cap of a is $1.5 billion and the TVL is around $10.3 billion which means that that valuation is 0.5. For ONDO it’s 15. It’s 100 times bigger so 0.5 is heavily undervalued where the regular valuation should be around 0.5 to 1 which means that there’s a lot of momentum to be made in,” he explained. Related Reading: Crypto Scam? PolitiFi Token RTR Plummets 95% After Trump Family Denies Link #3 RENZO In addition to AAVE, Van der Poppe brought attention to RENZO, another DeFi asset that, despite being in a downtrend, shows signs of reaching a lower valuation boundary that could attract speculative interest and potential upside. He described RENZO as a higher-risk investment compared to AAVE but noted that the asset’s significantly lower valuation in relation to its TVL could present a compelling buy opportunity for risk-tolerant investors. “I want to show you RENZO which currently has a market cap of $50 million, fully diluted $440 million, but the TVL which we can see on DefiLama is $1.3 billion. So in that aspect that valuation is even lower than AAVE but there is also more risk implied by investing in such an asset,” the analyst said. #4 AEVO Finally, Van der Poppe turned his attention to decentralized exchanges, specifically AEVO. He described AEVO’s unique position in the market, offering sophisticated trading options such as prediction markets, options, and hedging. “AEVO is very likely making a bullish divergence and a falling wedge, and is likely going to reverse from here,” he assessed, indicating potential upcoming growth potential. “These are my primary bets that I want to take going forward in this market and in the next few weeks,” van der Poppe concluded. At press time, TAO traded at $294.22.

32334251,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634997,1723482022,Dogecoin Investors Are Doubling Down on Mpeppe: The Next Big ICO to Watch,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, a new trend has emerged among Dogecoin (DOGE) investors, who are increasingly turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising new Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that is generating significant buzz. The Appeal of Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts. Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin’s lighthearted approach and strong community have propelled it into mainstream popularity. Thanks in large part to high-profile endorsements and its widespread adoption as a tipping currency on social media, DOGE has seen its value skyrocket over the years. However, while Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to be a beloved asset in the crypto community, many investors are beginning to seek out new opportunities that offer the potential for even greater returns. This is where Mpeppe (MPEPE) comes into play. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Next Big ICO Mpeppe (MPEPE) is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about ICOs in the cryptocurrency world. Positioned as the next big thing in the meme coin market, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting attention for its unique approach and the significant potential it offers to early investors. Unlike many other meme coins that rely solely on their community for value, Mpeppe is designed with innovative features that make it stand out in a crowded market. For one, MPEPE incorporates advanced tokenomics that are aimed at ensuring long-term value retention and growth. Additionally, the Mpeppe platform offers a suite of tools and applications that provide real utility to its users, setting it apart from the typical meme coin fare. Why Dogecoin (DOGE) Investors Are Interested The recent interest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) from Dogecoin (DOGE) investors is not surprising. Many DOGE holders are drawn to the familiar meme coin culture that Mpeppe represents, but they are also intrigued by the additional features and potential for higher returns that MPEPE offers. Given the success many have had with Dogecoin (DOGE), it’s only natural for these investors to look for the next big opportunity within the same niche. The combination of Mpeppe’s innovative approach and its appeal to the meme coin community makes it a logical choice for those looking to diversify their portfolios and maximize their gains. The Potential for Growth Mpeppe (MPEPE) is still in its early stages, but the momentum is already building. As more investors, particularly those from the Dogecoin (DOGE) community, begin to participate in the MPEPE presale, the potential for substantial returns becomes increasingly likely. Market analysts are closely watching the development of Mpeppe, with some suggesting that it could be the next big breakout in the meme coin space. If the project continues to gain traction, early investors could see significant gains, much like those who got in on Dogecoin (DOGE) before it took off. Conclusion For Dogecoin (DOGE) investors looking to replicate the success they’ve enjoyed with DOGE, Mpeppe (MPEPE) presents a compelling opportunity. With its unique features, innovative tokenomics, and growing interest from the crypto community, Mpeppe is quickly positioning itself as the next big ICO to watch. As always, investors should conduct their own research, but the early signs indicate that MPEPE could be a major player in the meme coin space in the near future.

KfW plans the bond issuance in the coming weeks under the German Electronic Securities Act (eWpG). BSD will oversee the crypto wallets and secure the private keys during the issuance and redemption processes.  The upcoming offering will be part of the European Central Bank's trials to settle blockchain-based transactions against central bank money.  ""As one of the world's largest and most active bond issuers, we are actively driving digitalisation initiatives in the issuing and settlement process,"" Gaetano Panno, head of transaction management at KfW, said in a statement. ""The utilization of new technologies as part of the ECB trials enables us to technically process a 'delivery vs. payment' transaction and thus supports our digital learning journey.""  KfW's issuance is the latest example of traditional financial institutions exploring ways to put traditional financial instruments such as bonds, credit and funds on blockchain rails. The process, also known as tokenization of real-world assets (RWA), promises operational benefits such as faster and more transparent transaction settlements, lower costs and greater efficiency and transparency.

42417460,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYVdl,1723478400,Optimism Pushes for 'Interoperability' Between Affiliated Blockchains,"Optimism, which has been successful in building out an ecosystem of affiliated blockchain networks, is now looking to more tightly connect them all.  “The Superchain needs to feel like one chain,” the Optimism team wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk.  Optimism, a layer-2 blockchain ecosystem atop Ethereum that has been successful in attracting new projects to use its technology – notably including Coinbase's Base – is now looking to more intimately connect the affiliated networks.  The ecosystem, built with the aim of allowing users to transact for cheaper on top of Ethereum, laid out its roadmap on Monday for what it's describing as a native interoperability solution, addressing issues of fragmentation between the various Optimism chains.  The announcement comes as more layer-2 ecosystems release their own interoperability solutions, like rival Polygon’s AggLayer and the Elastic Chain from Matter Labs, which is the developer firm behind the ZKsync blockchain.  Optimism’s own ecosystem has grown tremendously since its inception, partly due to its OP Stack, a customizable toolkit that lets developers build their own layer-2 networks based off of Optimism’s technology, like Coinbase’s Base chain or Worldcoin’s Worldchain.  Among the top 20 layer-2 blockchains tracked by the data site L2Beat, nine are part of the Optimism ecosystem. Collectively, those have some $16 billion of total value locked, which exceeds the $15.1 billion boasted by the biggest individual layer-2 network, Arbitrum One.  When teams launch their own networks using OP Stack, they agree to sign on to Optimism’s Superchain ethos: a series of economic and cultural agreements that contribute to Optimism’s ecosystem.  “I think, like, the best way to think about the Superchain is that it's a set of people and organizations that are aligned towards the common goal of elevating humanity and upgrading capitalism,” said Mark Tyneway, the co-founder of OP Labs, the main developer firm behind Optimism, in an interview with CoinDesk.  “All of the chains that are a part of the Superchain, they pay a part of the revenue that they make at running their sequencer to the Optimism governance, and Optimism governance does retroactive public goods funding,” meaning it distributes tokens and grants to those who contribute to Optimism’s ecosystem, Tyneway said.  Relying on Ethereum  One drawback stifling growth has been that the networks that are part of the Superchain rely on Ethereum to communicate with each other in order to move assets, which tends to make such moves slow and expensive.  To address that, Optimism is coming out with its own native interoperability layer, so networks in the Superchain have an easier time communicating with each other.  “The Superchain needs to feel like one chain,” the Optimism team wrote in a blog post shared with CoinDesk. “To achieve this, we're setting out to build a unified Superchain where users, assets, and developers move seamlessly across the network and beyond.”  The Optimism team plans to have the native interoperability solution up and running on mainnet by early 2025. In the interim, the Optimism team will launch the interoperability layer on a developer network soon, followed by a launch on a test network.  “So interoperability as a technology, it lets you basically read information from one chain and process that information on another chain,” Tyneway told CoinDesk.

This time, the analyst predicted that the ‘stablecoin’ could rise by over 360% and revealed when this parabolic run would happen. When USTC Will Rise By Over 360% In a chart shared in an X (formerly Twitter) post, Marks suggested that USTC could begin its 360% parabolic run sometime this month and peak in September. The analyst explained that USTC is still holding a Bullish Divergence and multiple sets of higher lows, indicating that the token is still in a bullish environment, with a 360% recovery run on the horizon. Related Reading: Celsius Takes Legal Action Against Tether In $2.4 Bitcoin Collateral Controversy Marks added that with prices still broken out, this run could lead to USTC rising to $0.08097 and that it ” may take place at unimaginable speeds.” As part of his analysis, Marks showed that USTC’s relative strength index (RSI) is still hitting higher lows despite the token’s price decline, suggesting that bears may be losing their control with a bullish reversal on the horizon. Marks had noted in an earlier analysis how USTC showed “major recovery strength” as it recorded a price move of over 54% after confirming a key Bullish Divergence. He affirmed that a higher price rally was still in play as his $0.08097 price target remained unchanged. USTC is a decentralized and algorithmic stablecoin on the Terra blockchain. It lost its dollar peg during the infamous LUNA crash in May 2022 and dropped to an all-time low of $0.006218 in June 2022. However, since then, the stablecoin has experienced some sort of revival thanks to the USTC burns carried out by the Terra Classic community. Data from LUNC Metrics shows that 2.32 billion USTCs have been burned since May 2022, although the stablecoin still has a circulating supply of almost 5.6 billion USTC. Thanks to this, USTC is up by over 150% from its all-time low. However, it remains to be seen if the stablecoin will ever regain its dollar peg. Bullish Prediction For LUNC Marks also recently provided a bullish prediction for Terra Classic (LUNC). He stated that LUNC is “starting to look absolutely primed to go” and that the crypto token could enjoy a minimum 5.7x price gain. In another X post, he explained that LUNC’s price continues to diverge bullishly based on the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) indicator. Related Reading: Bitcoin Death Cross Threatens To Trigger Crash If Price Does Not Hold $62,000 He remarked that this could be a sign that the bears are losing power and that the bulls are getting ready to dominate the market again. He added that the price target for LUNC as it makes this parabolic run is $0.00042986. Marks had previously claimed that LUNC could rise to as high as $0.00139122 in this bull run.

Optimism said that the first half of the year saw open-source contributors push over half of the platform’s current features in the OP stack. This commitment to decentralization along with network features helps it to be flexible and scalable making Optimism a viable investment for the long term. Optimism Still Looking At Minor Hurdles In The Long Run The market rebound created gains for investors while this week’s opening moves wiped the majority of it to the ground. This created an atmosphere of fear, uncertainty, and doubt for the token’s future movement. As of writing, the token remains on the $1.2-$1.6 price range which it entered last week because of the market retreat. Related Reading: Solana Rockets Up 23% As Developments Spark Investor Interest The slight uptick in price by the tailend of last week has exhausted the bears, putting OP into consolidation mode for the coming weeks. If the bulls are successful in defending this position, the token will see itself trading on a narrower range before shooting up toward the $2 mark. But this can only happen if the market recovers from its 5% downward move today. If they can weather the coming FUD within the next two weeks, OP has a chance to regain lost ground pushing its price upward.

42417464,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTYViv,1723469524,Kamala Harris Pulls Well Ahead of Trump on Polymarket,"This week in prediction markets:  🗳️ Harris pulls ahead on Polymarket  🎙️ MAGA and crypto are likely on the agenda for Trump's interview with Musk as the former president returns to X  🤖 Kalshi bettors see slim chance OpenAI's Sora is released to the public before 2025  U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris now has a seven-point lead over Donald Trump on Polymarket, after flipping the prediction market odds on Aug. 9 and tying the day before.  ""Yes"" shares for Harris were trading at 52 cents on the crypto-based betting platform Monday during U.S. morning hours, meaning the market sees a 52% chance she will win the presidency. Each share pays out $1 in USDC, a stablecoin, or cryptocurrency that trades at par with the U.S. dollar, if the prediction comes true, and zero if not. Trump shares were changing hands at 45 cents.  Less than a month ago, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris, Trump's odds were as high as 72%.  Current levels put Harris at a premium when compared to polling aggregates. Real Clear Polling's average of polls has Harris with a 0.5 percentage point lead. Some mainstream polls still have Trump ahead: A poll sponsored by Harvard conducted at the end of July gives Trump a four percentage point lead, while CNBC's latest poll that surveyed up until Aug. 4 has Trump with a two-point lead, and Republican-leaning Rasmussen Reports gives Trump a five-point advantage.  Read More: Crypto Insiders Courting Vice President Harris Chase Whispers of Her Openness  Since her ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has received glowing coverage in the mainstream press and celebrity endorsements, while Trump's recent public performances have reportedly rattled his advisors.  On the other hand, the idiosyncrasies of trading may overstate the magnitude of the reversal of fortune on Polymarket.  One active political bettor who goes by the handle CSPTrading.eth said he's observed panic selling and groupthink in election markets.  ""Someone who bought Trump at 70 and keeps seeing the price fall [has been] dumping to get out,"" he said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""It's also a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy because market makers will buy directionally to hedge their exposure to the price movements and then dump into each other.""  CSPTrading.eth points to some of the state-level markets (which party will carry Alaska or Indiana, for example) where one trader will dump a ""rapidly depreciating asset"" and others follow suit.  ""They don't want to be holding the bag,"" he said.  There are arbitrage opportunities on Polymarket's various balance-of-power contracts, where traders can buy exposure to a Trump presidency for less than what it costs in the main contract, CSPTrading.eth said.  For instance, a contract that asks bettors to put a stake on the possibility of Republicans taking the Presidency and Senate, but the Democrats winning the House – with some models showing the Republicans having a 78% chance of winning the Senate – is currently trading for 12 cents (or a 12% chance) while a contract predicting a Republican sweep is at 28%.  Together these would be trading at 40 cents, compared to the 46 cents Trump is trading for in the main contract.  Will he say it?  Elon Musk and Donald Trump are set to take to X's digital airwaves Monday night U.S. time, and there's a good chance the former President will mention crypto.  Bettors are giving a 60% chance that Trump will do so during the interview, which seems like a safe bet considering that his appearance at the recent BTC 2024 conference was a sold-out affair with thunderous applause.  There's a catch: Trump will need to say ""crypto"" specifically. Not bitcoin, not Ethereum, but rather the umbrella term itself. Any usage of the word, including plural or possessive forms, will count toward the market's resolution, the rules read. Compound words including ""crypto"" referring to decentralized currencies will also count.  Bettors are also giving ""MAGA,"" ""censor"" or ""censorship,"" ""Tesla,"" and ""illegal Immigrant"" a high chance of being said.  Meanwhile, the former President also returned to X after a nearly year-long hiatus of tweeting. His last post on Musk's social media site was from Aug. 24, 2023 and featured his mugshot.  Two contracts asked bettors about Trump's return to X, with one asking whether he would tweet again before the election and another asking if he would do so by the end of September.  The former had nearly $150,000 in volume with a user going by the handle ""BarronTrump"" holding the most shares on the yes side, winning over $9,000. This trader has also taken a no position currently valued at $5,600 on a contract about Kamala Harris winning the election.  A user holding the second-largest position on the Trump-Twitter question made off with $8,500. This trader also holds a sizable ""yes"" stake on the Harris side of the election question, currently worth over $35,000.  On the smaller contract, which asked if Trump would return to X by Sept. 30, only two bettors held the ""yes"" side with $34 between them. On the ""no"" side, the largest user lost just over $5,100 – and only seems interested in betting on this contract and one about whether the Binance exchange will list the token of a self-described ""crypto casino,"" Rollbit.  When Sora?  When OpenAI unveiled its text-to-video generative artificial intelligence model Sora earlier this year, the world was amazed. The demo promised that someday video as realistic as a high-end Playstation game could be generated in real-time.  Missing from that initial demo was a launch date.  Bettors on Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated platform where bets are settled in dollars, are giving it a 38% chance of Sora being launched before 2025, down from 75% when the contract was initiated in May.  One of the problems OpenAI may be running into is the intense computational cost of generating real-time video. As CoinDesk reported earlier this year, research group Fractorial Funds estimates that 720,000 high-end Nvidia H100 GPUs would be required to serve the TikTok and YouTube creative community with AI-generated video.  This amount of silicon would come at a cost of $21.6 billion, stats from the report show, and the total count of cards would be more than Meta, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Oracle and Tencent – some of Nvidia's largest customers – have collectively.  Bettors may also be factoring in that AI's massive demand for electricity could be straining the grid, and testing the political will to build more data centers.  Research from SemiAnalysis shows that AI's demand for server capacity is expected to double, with global data center power needs jumping from 49 gigawatts in 2023 to 96 gw by 2026. This projected steep jump in power demands has meant that even Texas, which has historically embraced electricity-intensive bitcoin mining and data centers, is souring on the idea of building out more capacity.  One hedge to all of this: China's ByteDance recently released its own version of a text-to-video generator, only available to users in China. There are limits to the amount of video each user can generate, but it does show that this whole thing isn't impossible.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/news-analysis/2024/08/12/kamala-harris-pulls-well-ahead-of-trump-on-polymarket,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a71999a4ba2699261e34b107f7454b0f53110423-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32328500,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634918,1723467640,Dogecoin Rivals PlayDoge & MPEPE Attract $10M Dogecoin Whale To Presale,"In the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency, the competition among meme coins is intensifying as new players enter the market with innovative concepts and promising returns. Dogecoin (DOGE), once the undisputed king of meme coins, is now facing stiff competition from emerging tokens like PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). These two rivals have recently garnered significant attention, particularly from a Dogecoin whale who has invested a substantial $10 million in their presales, signaling a potential shift in the meme coin hierarchy. The Rise of PlayDoge (PLAY) PlayDoge (PLAY) has quickly become a standout in the meme coin space, thanks to its unique approach that blends nostalgia with modern crypto technology. Inspired by the Tamagotchi craze of the 90s, PlayDoge offers a Play-to-Earn (P2E) model where users can care for virtual dogs and earn $PLAY tokens as rewards. This innovative concept has struck a chord with the crypto community, helping PlayDoge achieve a valuation of $6 million during its presale—a remarkable feat in a challenging market environment. The rapid growth of PlayDoge (PLAY) is further evidenced by its burgeoning social media presence, with nearly 21,000 followers in just a few weeks. This growing community is a testament to the project’s potential, with many investors drawn to the combination of a nostalgic gaming experience and the lucrative opportunities presented by the $PLAY token. Moreover, PlayDoge’s staking feature has become a major attraction for investors. Currently, the staking pool holds 244 million PLAY tokens, representing around 20% of all presale tokens sold. With an annual staking yield of 77%, the potential for significant returns has enticed many to lock in their tokens, potentially leading to an offer shock once the coin hits decentralized exchanges. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender While PlayDoge (PLAY) has captured attention with its gaming-focused model, Mpeppe (MPEPE) is making waves with its promise of revolutionizing the gambling meme coin space. MPEPE has swiftly become a hot topic among investors, particularly those who have already seen substantial gains with Dogecoin (DOGE). With nearly all tokens in Stage 2 of its presale already claimed, the high demand for MPEPE is clear. The token’s smart contract, 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, ensures secure and transparent transactions, further boosting investor confidence. The appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its innovative approach to the meme coin market, blending the appeal of gambling with the viral nature of meme culture. This unique positioning has made MPEPE an attractive option for those looking to capitalize on the next big trend in crypto. The Dogecoin whale’s decision to invest heavily in both PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the potential these tokens have to reshape the meme coin landscape. The Implications for Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among crypto enthusiasts, known for its strong community and backing from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. However, as the market for meme coins continues to evolve, Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing increased competition from newer, more innovative tokens. The whale’s significant investment in PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) suggests that even seasoned Dogecoin holders are diversifying their portfolios in search of higher returns. With Dogecoin (DOGE) currently experiencing volatility, the success of PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) could signal a shift in investor sentiment. As these new tokens continue to gain traction, they have the potential to challenge Dogecoin’s dominance in the meme coin market, offering investors fresh opportunities for substantial profits. Conclusion: A New Era for Meme Coins? As Dogecoin (DOGE) faces the challenge of maintaining its position in a rapidly changing market, PlayDoge (PLAY) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are emerging as formidable contenders. The $10 million investment from a Dogecoin whale into these presales highlights the growing confidence in their potential to deliver life-changing returns. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, the battle among meme coins is heating up, and these new players are ready to take the stage.

32328496,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634924,1723467628,"Playdoge, DOGE & MPEPE: Analyst Weigh In On The Hottest Tokens With 100x Potential","In a significant move that underscores the growing interest in the meme coin space, a crypto whale has pledged a massive $5,000,000 investment across three prominent meme coins: PlayDoge (PLAY), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mpeppe (MPEPE). This commitment is not only a testament to the potential of these tokens but also a strategic play to maximize profits in an increasingly volatile market. PlayDoge (PLAY): Nostalgia Meets Innovation PlayDoge (PLAY) has been gaining traction, particularly after its presale surged past the $6 million mark. The project’s appeal lies in its unique blend of ‘90s nostalgia and modern Web3 technology. Inspired by the beloved Tamagotchi, PlayDoge’s (PLAY) P2E (Play-to-Earn) game allows users to care for and interact with a digital pet Doge, earning PLAY tokens in return. This combination of gaming and earning has attracted significant attention, especially from large investors who see the potential for high returns. The crypto whale’s decision to invest heavily in PlayDoge (PLAY) is a clear indication of confidence in the project’s future. The P2E game is expected to revolutionize the mobile gaming space within the crypto ecosystem, making PlayDoge (PLAY) a top contender in the meme coin market. Dogecoin (DOGE): The Veteran Meme Coin Dogecoin (DOGE), often referred to as the original meme coin, continues to maintain a strong presence in the crypto market. Despite its ups and downs, Dogecoin (DOGE) remains a favorite among both retail investors and whales alike. The coin’s robust community support and the backing of influential figures like Elon Musk have kept Dogecoin (DOGE) relevant, even as new competitors emerge. The whale’s allocation of part of the $5 million to Dogecoin (DOGE) underscores the belief that, while new projects like PlayDoge (PLAY) and MPEPE offer exciting prospects, Dogecoin’s established brand and market position still hold significant value. This move could be seen as a balanced approach, combining the stability of an established token with the high-risk, high-reward potential of newer players. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become one of the most talked-about new tokens in the meme coin arena. Known for its innovative approach and strong community engagement, MPEPE has been capturing the attention of investors looking for the next big opportunity. The token’s ongoing presale has shown impressive results, with a significant percentage of tokens already sold, indicating strong market demand. The whale’s investment in Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a strategic bet on its potential to deliver outsized returns. With the presale moving swiftly through its stages and investor interest growing, MPEPE is positioning itself as a formidable player in the meme coin market. A Strategic Diversification The crypto whale’s $5,000,000 investment across these three tokens represents a strategic diversification aimed at balancing risk and reward. By spreading the investment across an established coin like Dogecoin (DOGE), a nostalgic yet innovative project like PlayDoge (PLAY), and a high-potential newcomer like Mpeppe (MPEPE), the whale is positioning themselves to benefit from multiple avenues of growth in the meme coin sector. As the meme coin market continues to evolve, this significant investment could set the stage for these three tokens to dominate the space, offering substantial returns to early investors who recognize their potential.

This rebound brought BTC back above the crucial $60,000 level after it had experienced a significant sell-off in August, with the price dropping 33.32 percent from its cycle high and All-Time High of $73,666. This marked the largest decline of the current cycle. Key metrics, such as the Mayer Multiple , which compares Bitcoin’s current price to its 200-day moving average (200DMA), provide insight into the severity of this downturn. The Mayer Multiple dropped to 0.88 during the recent decline, a level not seen since the FTX collapse in November 2022, indicating a strong bearish phase as Bitcoin traded significantly below its average historical trend. On-chain metrics also highlight the intensity of the sell-off. The Short-Term Holder Realised Price (STH Cost-Basis), which reflects the average purchase price of recent buyers, is currently at $64,860. Bitcoin’s spot price recently approached the -1 standard deviation (SD) band below this STH Cost-Basis, a rare occurrence, historically seen in only about 7.1 percent of trading days. This highlights the severity of the current market conditions. The Short-Term Holder MVRV ratio , which compares the current market price to the purchase price for newer investors, shows that this group is holding the largest unrealised losses since the bear market lows of 2022. Overall, these metrics underline the deep bearish sentiment and stress among short-term investors, which usually occurs at local bottoms. The US economy continues to display resilience , with recent data offering a more optimistic outlook despite ongoing concerns of a potential slowdown. Last week, a significant drop in jobless claims and a steady rise in wholesale inventories provided a solid foundation for economic growth, particularly in the second quarter, where US wholesale inventories played a crucial role in economic expansion. Household debt levels in the second quarter edged up slightly , highlighting a growing financial burden on consumers. However, with delinquency rates remaining stable, it is evident that borrowers are still supporting economic activity, albeit with some signs of strain. The slower pace of credit usage and rising financial stress hint at a potential deceleration in consumer spending, which could temper economic growth unless the Federal Reserve considers adjusting interest rates. Adding to the mixed economic signals, the US services sector experienced a notable rebound in July, recovering from a four-year low as new orders surged and employment within the sector grew for the first time in six months. This resurgence in services may help ease fears of a recession, particularly in light of the recent spike in unemployment and continued stock market volatility. In the latest news from the crypto-sphere, Kamala Harris has emerged as the frontrunner in the 2024 US presidential race, leading Donald Trump by a narrow margin in both betting odds and recent polls. As her campaign gains momentum, there is growing speculation about her potential stance on cryptocurrency, particularly as her team has begun engaging with industry executives. This engagement hints at the possibility that cryptocurrency policy may become a focus in the coming months, sparking interest and anticipation within the crypto community. Simultaneously, major financial institutions like BlackRock and Nasdaq are making strides in the digital asset market, as they recently filed a request with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce options trading for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF. This move comes on the heels of the SEC’s approval of Ethereum-linked ETFs from several prominent firms, signalling a significant expansion in investment options for digital assets. As these developments unfold, the SEC continues to play a pivotal role in shaping the cryptocurrency landscape, evidenced by its recent decision to delay approval of Hashdex’s proposed ETF , which aims to directly hold spot Bitcoin and Ether. The postponement, extending the review period until September 30, 2024, reflects the SEC’s cautious approach as it meticulously evaluates the implications of new digital asset products on the market.

32327808,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634877,1723465838,"Toncoin Rally Thwarted As TON Slips To $6, Can Bulls Prevent A Bearish Breakdown?","Toncoin’s recent bullish momentum has faced a sudden reversal, as the cryptocurrency has slipped back to the critical $6 level. After showing promising signs of a rally, TON faced increased selling pressure, forcing it to retreat to this key support zone. The question here is, Can the bulls defend this level and prevent a deeper bearish breakdown, or is Toncoin poised for a further decline as bearish sentiment grows? Addressing this subject, this article seeks to provide a detailed analysis of Toncoin’s recent price action, focusing on the sudden halt in its bullish momentum and its retreat to the critical $6 support level. Additionally, it will assess what to watch for in Toncoin’s price movements and anticipate its next moves. Toncoin has dropped by 5.19%, currently trading around $6.27 over the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization stands at over $15 billion, with a trading volume exceeding $373 million at the time of writing. TON’s market cap has decreased by 5.21%, while its trading volume has surged by 43.65% The $6 Battleground: Will Bulls Stand Strong? Currently, the price of TON on the 4-hour chart is demonstrating a bullish comeback after hitting the $6 mark and is attempting to move above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) toward the $6.7 mark. This, therefore, suggests that the bulls are gradually gaining strength over the bears and could further drive the price higher. Additionally, an analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line of the indicator after a successful drop below 50%, is currently rising again toward it, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing and the asset might experience further upward movement. On the 1-day chart, although Toncoin is still trading below the 100-day SMA, the price is currently attempting an upward move toward the $6.7 resistance level after a bullish rejection at $6, which means that the bulls are currently gaining control and could potentially push the price higher. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line is attempting a climb above 50% from the oversold zone, indicating growing bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency. Bullish Defense Or Bearish Takeover: What’s Next For Toncoin? Recent trading activities show that Toncoin has demonstrated bullish defense at the $6 mark and is currently attempting to move toward the $6.7 resistance level. If the crypto asset reaches this level and breaks above, it could lead to a further bearish move toward the next resistance level at $7.7 and possibly other levels beyond. However, if there is a bearish takeover and TON’s price breaks below the $6 mark, the cryptocurrency may continue to decline toward the $4.6 support mark. Should the price fall below this support, it could drop further to test the $3.3 support level and continue to lower support ranges on the chart if the $3.3 price target is breached.

The report summarizes the top 100 DeFi hacks between 2016 and 2023, the accumulated total of which comes to $7.4 billion with the majority of attacks occurring on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Polygon.  Although on-chain hacks including smart contract exploitation, price manipulation and governance attacks are most prevalent, off-chain attacks like private key theft represent 29% of the total number of attacks and 34.6% of the funds stolen in general. In 2023 off-chain attacks made up 56.5% of total attacks and accounted for 57.5% of the stolen amount.  The report adds that just 21% of hacked protocols used multi-sig wallets, which is a security method that requires multiple people to approve a transaction at the same time.  Halborn also warns that the majority of on-chain attacks occurred on protocols that were not audited and that protocol's lack of faulty input verification or validation is the main cause of loss in terms of smart contract exploitation.  Cross-chain bridges also remain as a key attack vector for bad actors, Halborn adds that protocols should ""review the code carefully"" before using a cross-chain bridge.  Last week, the Ronin Bridge has hacked resulting in a loss of $12 million, that followed a $625 million exploit to the same protocol two years prior.  An Immunefi report earlier this year showed that hacks targeting DeFi had resulted in the loss of $473 million in the first half of 2024.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | TRADING | BNB,Oliver Knight,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/08/12/defi-hacks-remain-a-major-threat-despite-50-decline-in-2023-halborn,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9c587f950776673320ba29ef3bf8f7ad4781393-4024x2688.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

BTC is down around 2.15% in the last 24 hours, sitting just below $59,500, while the wider digital asset market has lost nearly 2.9%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20). Solana's SOL led the losses, falling nearly 3% to $149. Data for U.S.-listed ETFs are also muted, with bitcoin funds seeing $89 million of outflows on Friday and their ether equivalents losing $15.7 million.  Some market watchers warned of a further BTC decline in the coming weeks citing technical weakness while pointing to forthcoming economic reports that could provide upward pressure. “Crypto prices will likely be rangebound with a bias to the weak side,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA.org told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “Crypto markets lack a clear anchor and are susceptible to continued position adjustments. We continue to see muted ETF inflows for BTC and ETH over the past few sessions."" Both the U.K. and the U.S. release July CPI readings on Wednesday. Australia’s consumer confidence, which tracks sentiment around family finances, and Japan’s PPI, a measure of price developments of goods traded within the corporate sector, are scheduled for a Tuesday release.  A former Bank of Japan official said the central bank will defer additional interest rate hikes to next year. ""They won’t be able to hike again, at least for the rest of the year,” Makoto Sakurai said Friday, according to Bloomberg. “It’s a toss up whether they can do one hike by next March.” The BOJ raised its key interest rate to about 0.25% from a range around zero on July 31, the first increase in over a decade. The shift away from the zero interest rate policy pushed the yen higher, triggering an unwinding of the ""risk-on"" yen carry trades. The resulting slide in traditional risk assets weighed heavily over BTC, crashing the cryptocurrency from roughly $65,000 to $50,000 in less than seven days.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's price drawdowns in percentage terms since late 2022.  The recent decline from $70,000 to $50,000 was the largest.  ""As is typical with these drawdowns: weak hands were shaken out, and seasoned veterans bought the dip,"" Blockware said in an email.

Gambaryan's next court hearing is currently scheduled for October 11th.  Tigran Gambaryan, the U.S. Binance employee held in Nigeria, is being ""denied adequate access to his legal team and his health is deteriorating rapidly,"" his family said in an emailed statement to CoinDesk on Monday.  Gambaryan was brought by wheelchair to an Abuja, Nigeria courtroom for a hearing on July 16th. The court then went on holiday, with the next hearing set for Oct. 11th. His legal team has not been allowed to visit him in Kuje prison since July 26 and he is now bedridden, according to the email.  ""Tigran's lawyers have filed a request for his case to be heard over the recess period,"" a spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email.  Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission and Nigeria's Financial Crimes Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The family also said the ""prison continues to hold"" the executive's medical records despite a court order for officials at the prison to release them.  ""The herniated disc in Tigran’s back requires highly specialized and risky surgery. He has had so many throat infections as well as pneumonia at Kuje, that he now also requires a further surgery to remove his tonsils. As he is mostly bedridden, he is now having to take blood thinners to avoid blood clots,"" the family said.

32325605,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634861,1723460454,"Legendary Fibonacci Extension Reveals When Bitcoin Will Reach $109,000","Crypto analyst CryptoCon has highlighted a technical indicator that has always accurately predicted each local high for Bitcoin in this bull run. Once again, this indicator has revealed the next local high for Bitcoin and when it will happen. When Bitcoin Will Reach A Local High Of $109,000 CryptoCon predicted in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the Bitcoin Fibonacci extension is set to push the flagship crypto over $100,000 as it rises to $109,236, a move which the analyst added could happen by year-end. He suggested that Bitcoin reaching $109,000 by December 2024 will only likely happen if the “1-month-behind 2023” trend continues. Related Reading: XRP Price Enters Wave 3, Crypto Analyst Puts Top At $36.76 The analyst’s chart showed that Bitcoin has hit a local top this year, one month ahead of each local top in 2023. The last local top for Bitcoin in 2023 rolled over into 2024 and occurred in January 2024. Based on the trend, the next local top could happen in December rather than rolling over into the new year. Bitcoin’s potential rise to $100,000 and even $109,000 is one that several other analysts, like Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Assets Research Geoffrey Kendrick, have predicted would happen at some point. Interestingly, Kendrick stated that Bitcoin would reach $100,000 ahead of the US elections in November and hit $150,000 by year-end if Trump wins the presidential election. Meanwhile, based on CryptoCon’s most recent analysis, a rise to $109,000 is unlikely to be the market top for Bitcoin, as the flagship crypto still has a long way to go in this bull run. The analyst stated that he is convinced that Bitcoin still has over a year of the bull market to go based on the 3-week Fibonacci Channel RSI. This coincides with crypto analyst Rekt Capital’s prediction that the market top won’t come until sometime in September or October 2025. BTC Could Reach $250,000 In This Bull Run Crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe has raised the possibility of Bitcoin rising to as high as $250,000 in this market cycle. He stated that Bitcoin’s monthly candle closing at around $60,000 could be the consolidation before the “big bull breakout,” which would likely be the start of Bitcoin’s “big run” to $250,000. Related Reading: Dogecoin Major Metrics Fire Bullish Signals, Can Price Cross $0.5 The $250,000 price target is still below Cryptoquant CEO Ki Young Ju’s prediction that Bitcoin could achieve a market top of $265,000 in this market cycle. He made this prediction based on the Hashrate/Market Cap ratio, which he claimed supports a Bitcoin market cap three times larger than the one it clocked during the last cyclical top. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $58,600, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

42390627,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4c5f,1723455533,"XRP Bullish Options' Popularity Jump May Be Due to ETF Speculation, Observers Say","Traders have locked in over $2 million in XRP's $1.10 call option listed on Deribit, the highest across all available maturities.  The large open interest in the nascent XRP options market likely reflects ETF optimism.  Deribit's nascent options market for XRP is experiencing a surge in activity, particularly in the $1.10 call option that represents a bet that prices for the payments-focused cryptocurrency will double by the end of the month.  As of writing, XRP's $1.10 call option, set to expire on Aug. 28, had an open interest of 4,347,000 contracts valued at $2.44 million, making it the most favored among all available XRP options on the exchange, according to data tracked by Amberdata. The amount is significant for an options market that is barely five months old.  The so-called open interest, or the number of active bets, has increased by 838,000 contracts in the past 24 hours alone.  According to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin, the increased activity in the $1.10 call likely reflects a net long positioning.  ""From the gamma distribution, it feels like a net long position expiring on Aug. 30. If the resistance level of $0.75 from the past two weeks can be broken, the price of XRP is likely to rise above $1.10,"" Ardern told CoinDesk in an interview.  ""Perhaps institutions will likely apply for an XRP ETF in the U.S., which may be an important factor driving a sharp rise in prices,"" Ardern added.  XRP rose over 30% to 62 cents last month but has since pulled back to just over 57 cents, according to CoinDesk data.  A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset, XRP, at a predetermined price on or before the expiry date. A call buyer is essentially bullish on the market, betting on a rally above the level at which the call has been bought. Gamma refers to the rate of change in an option's delta, reflecting how sensitive the option's price is to the changes in the underlying asset's price.  CoinDesk reached out to Deribit for further information.  Last Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Analisa Torres ruled on the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) motion against Ripple Labs, stemming from a 2020 lawsuit over unregistered XRP sales. The court imposed a $125 million penalty for institutional sales of XRP and an injunction against further violations but rejected the SEC's demand for a $2 billion fine.  Ripple hailed the judgment as a victory, sparking hopes of a potential XRP ETF debut in the U.S. The regulator approved bitcoin and ether ETFs early this year, opening doors to billions of dollars in mainstream money.  Still, Martin Cheung, Pulsar Trading Capital's options trader, expressed skepticism on whether prices could rally beyond $1.10 by Aug. 28.  ""XRP has rallied a lot this year, plus, I think people are betting the next ETFs to be approved will be on XRP and SOL,"" Cheung said when asked about the increased demand for $1.10 XRP call options.  ""That said, the August end is too close; a potential XRP ETF announcement might drive prices higher by, say, 20%, but $1.10 looks too far,' Cheung added.

However, the token is still up nearly 22% in the past month, going against the market’s general bearishness after last week’s slip and slide. Related Reading: XRP Price Reaches Support: Will It Trigger a Turnaround? Solana’s significant traction around the world has garnered some attention in the institutional space, leading to a development that might help SOL weather the bearish storm ahead. But with the coming announcements of several macro indicators, there might be trouble in the coming weeks. Brazil Approves Solana ETF, Coming Ahead Of The USA The Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM), the Brazilian equivalent of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, approved QR Asset’s Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal on Wednesday becoming the first ever Solana ETF in Latin America. This development surpasses the United States as several Solana ETFs are still up for review by the SEC. According to local sources, the ETF is still subject to approval by B3, the company responsible for the country’s stock exchange. Nonetheless, this is a huge win for Brazilian crypto-enthusiasts as it solidifies the country’s position in the international crypto scene. “This ETF reaffirms our commitment to offering quality and diversification to Brazilian investors. We are proud to be global pioneers in this segment, consolidating Brazil’s position as a leading market for regulated investments in crypto assets,” Theodoro Fleury, Manager and Chief Investment Officer at QR Asset, said in an interview. SOL Consolidation Phase Starts, Price To Stabilize On This Level Regulatory hurdles are the thing that block Solana ETFs from hitting the market. Although the SEC already pulled Solana’s name from its legal action against Binance, Solana ETFs in the US are still a long way ahead. But the market reacted spectacularly well from the Brazilian Solana ETF announcement. Although short term pain is relatively stingy, SOL’s position is quite healthy as the $131-$147 price range remains to be the bulls’ chosen platform for future upward movement. Meanwhile, World of Charts, a well-known cryptocurrency analyst, has identified the presence of a bullish pennant pattern. This pattern typically occurs after a significant upward price movement and is characterized by converging trendlines that resemble a symmetrical triangle. This pattern indicates a temporary halt in the market before continuing the current upward trend. ETF: Boon Or Bane? The ETF announcement has definitely hurt the bears, which further reduced the possibility of further downturn. Moving forward, investors and traders should watch the broader market developments that may or may not affect the token’s price movement. In this case, watching how institutional entities grow in interest on Solana– and crypto as a whole– is a great place to start.

Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius sued Tether for fraudulently securing itself as part of a loan agreement.  Tether, the company behind USDT, the world's largest stablecoin by market capitalization, said it will defend itself against what it called ""shakedown"" litigation brought by bankrupt crypto lender Celsius.  On Friday, Celsius asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York to order Tether to relinquish a total of 57,428.64 bitcoin {{BTC}} or award the ""present value of all Bitcoin,"" some $3.3 billion at today's price, according to a court filing.  ""This lawsuit incredibly now seeks the return of approximately US$2.4 billion worth of BTC from Tether, despite the BTC being liquidated at Celsius’ direction and with Celsius’ consent at June 2022 prices,"" Tether said in a statement on its website. Tether did not say how it calculated the $2.4 billion figure.  The case concerns a loan agreement between Celsius and Tether that allowed Celsius to borrow stablecoins ""to operate certain critical aspects of its business,"" according to the lawsuit. In the filing, Celsius alleges that when the market crashed in mid-2022, in the ""ninety-day period prior"" to Celsius' bankruptcy filing, Tether insulated itself from the impending bankruptcy by making ""preferential and fraudulent transfers"" of bitcoin.  ""Specifically, on several occasions, Tether demanded, and received, a significant amount of new, incremental collateral to improve its position in the impending bankruptcy,"" according to the lawsuit.  ""This baseless lawsuit is trying to claim that we should give back the bitcoin that were sold to cover Celsius’ position,"" Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino said in a post on X. ""There are plenty of flaws in the claimant’s filing and we're very confident in the solidity of our contract and our actions ... This lawsuit will be fought till the end. It's important to set an example on behalf of the entire industry that shameless money grabs will not work.""  Celsius argued that in June 2022, Tether ""applied Celsius’s Bitcoin against obligations owed to it for an average price of $20,656.88 each—considerably less than Bitcoin’s market closing price on June 13th, $22,487.39.""  ""Thus, these preferential and fraudulent transfers of Bitcoin should be avoided, and the Bitcoin or its value should be recovered for the benefit of Celsius’s estate,"" the filing said. It also demands $100 million in damages for breaches of contract.  According to Tether, when the market crashed, the agreement required ""Celsius to post additional collateral to avoid the liquidation of its BTC"" and ""when Celsius chose not to post additional BTC it directed Tether to liquidate the BTC collateral Tether held.""  Tether also said that the consolidated equity of the Tether Group was nearly $12 billion as of June 30, so ""even in the most remote scenario in which this baseless lawsuit will get somewhere, Tether token holders will not be impacted.""  Celsius' bankruptcy is officially closed after a court approved a reorganization plan in November.

32321631,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634831,1723450834,SUI Leads Crypto Market With 78% Weekly Uptick: Here’s Why,"Over the past seven days, Sui (SUI) has emerged as the standout performer in the crypto market, recording an massive 78% increase in its price. This surge positions SUI as the leader among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, significantly outperforming its peers, Helium (HNT) with a 60% increase and Bittensor (TAO) at 50%. Why Is SUI Up Over The Past Week? Andrew Kang, the founder of Mechanism Capital, provided insights into the SUI’s recent success in a series of posts on X. Kang suggested that the bullish trend could be attributed to several factors including a notable endorsement from influential figures, substantial over-the-counter (OTC) bids, robust holdership even after significant token unlocks, and a recent technical upgrade that could pave the way for innovative applications on the SUI platform. Related Reading: SUI Explodes 30% After Crypto Market Shows Signs Of Life “No knowledge of anything actually happening but combination of the below leading me to bet that there’s some interesting developments upcoming for SUI,” Kang posted. He listed several indicators supporting his optimistic outlook: “1. Raoul Pal shill thread while he sits on advisory board 2. Large OTC bids 3. Relatively strong holdership through big unlocks 4. Aggressive price action with no pullback 5. Big recent performance upgrade with Mysiceti potentially allowing for interesting new apps.” These points collectively hint at a buoyant market sentiment and substantial backing from influential market players. In a subsequent post, Kang touched on the promotional strategies surrounding SUI, noting, “Many people commenting that they are giving grants to people to shill. If true, this is bullish.” Related Reading: Crypto Scam? PolitiFi Token RTR Plummets 95% After Trump Family Denies Link The aforementioned Raoul Pal, founder/CEO of Global Macro Investor and RealVision and member of the advisory board of the Sui Foundation, recently praised SUI as a “groundbreaking ultra-fast L1, super efficient, full blockchain ecosystem” developed from the remnants of Meta’s Diem project, aimed at scaling to accommodate billions of users transitioning from Web2 to Web3 technologies. From a technical perspective, he added: “SUI is starting to look very interesting from a price perspective, although still early and unconfirmed, it is showing signs of breaking out against most tokens,” Pal noted. This includes comparisons against Aptos (another MOVE language L1 project), Avalanche (AVAX), Tia (TIA), Near Protocol (NEAR), Bitcoin (BTC), and Solana (SOL).” The week also saw institutional support further bolstering SUI’s market position. Grayscale, a leading digital currency asset manager, announced the introduction of the Grayscale Sui Trust. This new fund is solely dedicated to SUI, providing accredited individual and institutional investors with a structured vehicle for investing in this rising cryptocurrency. “We are excited to add Bittensor and Sui to our product suite, and believe Sui is redefining the smart contract blockchain,” stated Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research.

Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Slips to $140: Will This Level Support a Rebound? Posting in X, Marks attributed this to the formation of a Hidden Bullish Divergence in the FTM chart. According to the analyst, this has the potential to cause a significant rebound in the token, including a 234% upside.

In such a scenario, there is a warning that the price of the asset is prone to reverse and always carries a hint of the weakness in the bears while cautioning that the bulls are getting stronger. According to the technical signal of Marks, if the price plays through in the way outlined above, Fantom may explode to 234% and further. This in itself will not only be a huge bounce for the token but might be the perfect opening to shunt the token to a crucial level of $3. Whether such recovery is in place or not remains to be seen, something that traders and investors are discussing and most are now watching closely these price fluctuations of Fantom. Since the market of cryptocurrencies is so unpredictable, any sudden move like the Hidden Bullish Divergence could help in creating major market trends with the help of this technical indicator. Fantom Price Forecast The altcoin has been signaling a potential uptrend that could be achieved in the next seven days. The momentum, mostly driven by buy signals which keep mounting in the key technical indicators, is already happening. According to the price prediction data from CoinCheckup, bullish crossovers have taken place with the relative strength index pointing upwards in a direction towards overbought territory. This is a prelude to what is seen as a very strong upward push in the nearest term with respect to the price. In three months, Fantom is forecasted to have 38.87% growth in value on the back of positive market sentiment and growing trading volumes, CoinCheckup figures show.

The next move may come in March 2023, the official said  A former Bank of Japan (BOJ) official said the central bank would defer additional interest rate hikes to next year, suggesting a preference for market stability over the near term.  ""They won’t be able to hike again, at least for the rest of the year,” former board member Makoto Sakurai said late Friday, according to Bloomberg. “It’s a toss up whether they can do one hike by next March.”  The BOJ raised its key interest rate to about 0.25% from a range of zero on July 31, delivering the first hike in over a decade. The central bank also signaled additional rate hikes.  The shift away from the zero interest rate policy pushed the Japanese yen higher, triggering an unwinding of the ""risk-on"" yen carry trades. The resulting slide in traditional risk assets weighed heavily over BTC, crashing the cryptocurrency from roughly $65,000 to $50,000 in less than seven days.  Bitcoin has since recovered to trade above $58,000 amid signs of risk reset on Wall Street.

U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking these assets recorded outflows on Friday, with BTC ETFs losing $89 million and ETH ETFs seeing $15.7 million in outflows.  A slide in bitcoin {{BTC}} led to a wider crypto market selloff over the weekend as some traders looked for cues ahead of a busy week to determine positioning.  BTC sunk 4.8% in the past 24 hours trading just above $58,500 in Asian morning hours on Monday, CoinDesk Indices data shows, with the broader crypto market tracked by CoinDesk 20 (CD20), falling 5.2%. Ether {{ETH}} lost 3.5%.  U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking the assets recorded outflows on Friday. BTC ETFs lost $89 million, while ETH ETFs saw $15.7 million in outflows, according to market data.  Solana’s SOL and toncoin (TON) led losses among majors with a 7% slide. BNB Chain’s BNB lost 3%, dogecoin {{DOGE}} dropped 6%, while Cardano’s ADA and xrp (XRP) slid 5%.  Elsewhere, tokens of blockchains Aptos (APT), Arbitrum (ARB), and metaverse The Sandbox’s SAND dropped as much as 7% ahead of unlocks in the week, which will cumulatively release more than $120 million worth of the tokens in the open market, data shows. These tokens belong to the team and early investors.  Some market watchers warned of a further BTC decline in the coming weeks citing technical weakness, but pointed to upcoming traditional market releases that could provide upward pressure.  “Crypto prices will likely be rangebound with a bias to the weak side,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA.org told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. “However, the technical damage and sentiment drag remain, with on-chain cost models and MVRV models suggesting further possible shake-out before Jackson Hole.”  “Crypto markets lack a clear anchor and are susceptible to continued position adjustments. We continue to see muted ETF inflows for BTC and ETH over the past few sessions,” Fan added.  Both the U.K. and the U.S. will release July’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) readings on Wednesday. Australia’s consumer confidence, which tracks sentiment around family finances, and Japan’s Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of price developments of goods traded within the corporate sector, are scheduled for a Tuesday release.  Later in the week, retail behemoths Alibaba Group and Walmart will release earnings on Thursday, while Hong Kong and Taiwan will publish updated gross domestic product (GDP) on Friday.  Traditional market events tend to move crypto prices as they reveal spending behavior and the state of the general economy. Favorable releases tend to sway prices upward as investors are expected to bet more on riskier assets, such as technology stocks or cryptocurrencies, while an earnings or data miss tends to drive assets lower, as investors shift to safer bets.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,ASIA | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/12/bitcoin-nears-58k-in-selloff-ahead-of-busy-data-week,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b12575debf482fd8b773b23f599042eb522c389-2750x1547.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The price is now trading below $0.600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5750 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.580 resistance zone. XRP Price Hits Key Support XRP price struggled to extend gains above the $0.6450 and $0.650 levels. The price started a downside correction below the $0.600 level like Ethereum and Bitcoin. There was a move below the $0.5850 and $0.580 support levels.

The 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $0.4925 swing low to the $0.6475 high is acting as a support. The price is now trading below $0.600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price is facing hurdles near the $0.570 level. The first major resistance is near the $0.5750 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5750 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The next key resistance could be $0.580. A clear move above the $0.580 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5950 resistance. The next major resistance is near the $0.600 level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.620 resistance or even $0.650 in the near term. More Downsides? If XRP fails to clear the $0.580 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5520 level. The next major support is at $0.550. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.550 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5320 support. The next major support sits at $0.5250.

42390631,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4cVJ,1723437012,"Dragonfly, Crypto.com Weigh in on CFTC's Proposed Prediction Market Rules","The CFTC's notice of proposed rulemaking for prediction markets drew various comments from the public, including the crypto industry.  Crypto industry stakeholders say the rules are too broad and would constitute an overreach, considering the recent 'Chevron court decision.  Dragonfly Digital Management and Crypto.com have joined crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) in criticizing the Commodities Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) proposed rules on prediction markets.  Critics say that the CFTC's proposed rules broadly categorize and ban certain event contracts, including those related to gaming – with Coinbase calling the CFTC's proposed definition of gaming too ambiguous – and elections, raising concerns that this overreach exceeds statutory authority, stifles innovation, and neglects the economic benefits these contracts provide.  ""Political event contracts should not be equated with gambling on games of chance like the Super Bowl. Rather, elections have significant economic implications,"" Dragonfly's Jessica Furr and Bryan Edelman, its counsel, wrote in a letter to CFTC. ""These contracts were designed to serve crucial risk hedging functions, aligning with the requirements of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), and offer valuable predictive data to the public.""  Dragonfly also argues that the CFTC's proposed rule overreaches by broadly banning prediction markets without proper evaluation, especially given the Supreme Court's recent 'Chevron' decision, which limits the agency's interpretive authority without a Congressional mandate.  Crypto.com's Steve Humenik, its Special Vice President in charge of Capital Markets, argues that the CFTC's attempt to ban prediction markets violates a rulemaking process dictated by the CEA, which involves a three-step approach.  According to the CEA, the three-step process requires the CFTC to assess whether a contract involves an excluded commodity, whether it engages in specified activities, and whether it's contrary to the public interest before banning it.  ""The CFTC must articulate its justification for determining that a given contract has an underlying excluded commodity. This should not be a foregone conclusion,"" Humenik wrote. ""We urge the CFTC not to sidestep its obligations to undergo a three-step review process with respect to these types of event contracts, and to eliminate this aspect of the Event Contracts NOPR [notice of proposed rulemaking].""  Others not directly involved in the crypto industry also weighed in on the issue.  Joseph Fishkin, a Law Professor at UCLA, wrote that prediction markets offer valuable insights into public opinion and political events and should not be regulated in a way that shuts them down in the U.S.  ""I think they enrich our understanding of politics, the news media, political 'conventional wisdom,' and the extent to which crowds consistently get certain types of political predictions wrong,"" Fishkin wrote. ""I hope you will not regulate them out of existence in this country.""",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/12/dragonfly-cryptocom-weigh-in-on-cftcs-proposed-prediction-market-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0dc1e8b4cca5037925d0ee312f42162a65fcbb7-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The next major hurdle sits at $62,500. A close above the $62,500 resistance might spark bullish moves. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $65,000 resistance. More Downsides In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $60,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $58,500 level. The first major support is $57,650. The next support is now near the $57,250 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $55,500 support zone or even $55,000 in the near term.
