14191810,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/06/optimism-renames-blockchain-to-op-mainnet,1687716000,Optimism Renames Blockchain To $OP Mainnet,"Layer-2 scaling solution Optimism Labs has announced the renaming of its blockchain to “OP Mainnet.” The name change “makes clear the the delineation between the OP Mainnet blockchain and the Collective, vibe, and ethos that “Optimism” encompasses.” In the thread, Optimism continued that this move is motivated by its desire to create a “superchain”, that OP Mainnet “will be one L2 chain among many”, alongside Base, Celer, and Polygon zkEVM, among others. A New Name After Bedrock Optimism recently rolled out its Bedrock upgrade last June 6. With this much-anticipated upgrade, (the “bedrock” for the superchain-to-come), all associated and integrated chains either constructed within or designed in alignment with the OP tech stack (developer tooling, APIs, and SDKs) will be linked over, enabling smooth communication over a unified ecosystem. It was estimated that the upgrade would significantly reduce gas fees by 40% through a more refined data compression. The Bedrock upgrade brought Optimism a step closer to its goal of creating a superchain. Optimism has stayed its course as among the top L2 solutions, second only to its main rival Arbitrum. However, Optimism recently edged out Arbitrum in terms of transaction volume last January. Arbitrum still has the advantage in terms of total value locked (TVL). As of writing, Arbitrum has a total of $2.2b total in TVL while Optimism lags behind at $824m. One reason for this is Optimism’s focus on DEXs and derivatives protocols. Arbitrum’s operations also involve the previous two but more importantly, they also include cross-chain protocols, lending protocols, and yield farming. However, with the recent upgrade, a boost in Optimism’s competitiveness is expected as Bedrock will enable faster transactions with significantly cheaper fees. Implications Of The Change Change The shift from ""Optimism"" to ""OP Mainnet"" doesn't merely represent a rebranding effort; it also signals a transformative shift in the platform's strategy and vision. The intention to create a ""superchain"" indicates a drive towards more comprehensive interoperability and connectivity within the Ethereum ecosystem. OP Mainnet's aspiration to be one Layer 2 chain among many reflects a collective ambition to decentralize and democratize the Layer 2 landscape, broadening the scope for innovation and cooperation. This collaborative vision could drastically change the competitive dynamics within the Layer 2 space and Ethereum ecosystem more broadly. The data reveals a dynamic rivalry between OP Mainnet and Arbitrum, both in terms of transaction volume and total value locked (TVL). This competition extends to the heart of each platform's design choices and strategic focus. While both platforms aim to enhance the scalability of the Ethereum network, their distinct approaches reflect different priorities. OP Mainnet's single-round fraud proof system, although faster, is more expensive than Arbitrum's multi-round system. This difference has contributed to Optimism's lesser TVL and daily active addresses. However, the recent Bedrock upgrade is a potential game-changer in this respect. If the upgrade can deliver on its promise of significant gas fee reduction, it might alter the balance between speed and cost, making OP Mainnet an increasingly attractive platform for users and developers alike. The effectiveness of this strategy and its potential to shake up the Layer 2 landscape remains to be seen, but the ambition behind it is clear.

Following a successful referendum, the Bridge Hub, a critical tool for blockchain interoperability within the Polkadot ecosystem, has been upgraded to runtime v9420. As the primary facilitator for asset, message, and data transfers among different blockchains, the Bridge Hub greatly augments Polkadot's network functionality. Runtime Upgrade Marks Major Step for Interoperability By making transactions and data from one blockchain accessible and usable by others within the Polkadot ecosystem, the Bridge Hub promotes cross-chain capabilities. It fosters compatibility and collaboration across various blockchain projects, significantly augmenting the scope and potential of Polkadot's network. However, the impact of these changes on user acquisition remains to be seen. The success of upcoming referendums will be key in determining whether this protocol can achieve sustained growth moving forward. Despite the potential uncertainty, Polkadot's high staking reward ratio might attract users. Blockchain data indicates that $DOT, Polkadot's native token, has outperformed other cryptocurrencies in terms of staking rewards, boasting a reward rate of 14.54% for staking DOT. Interestingly, interest in DOT staking has waned somewhat, as evidenced by a 0.35% decrease in the number of stakers on the Polkadot network, according to Staking Rewards’ data. Impact and Implications of Runtime v9420 Delving deeper into the specifics of the Bridge Hub upgrade, it was a referendum to transition the Bridge Hub from v9382 to v9420. The prior call for this change failed because the Bridge Hub, operating on v9382 and therefore on XCM v3, expected an UnpaidExecution instruction before the Transact instruction, which Polkadot (on v9370 and XCM v2) could not provide. Now that Polkadot has shifted to XCM v3, the correct XCM program has become possible. The call to execute on the Relay Chain is a Whitelist Call. The weight parameters for this call, which influenced the Transact parameters, were as follows: refTime: 229,363,000 proofSize: 3,556 These technical developments reflect Polkadot's commitment to continuous improvement and optimization of its multi-chain interoperability. With these changes, we may see an influx of new users, increased staking, or an improved general market sentiment toward $DOT in the coming weeks.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, amidst this overall market trend, there are still standout performers, and Pepe (PEPE) is one such cryptocurrency that continues to impress. Related Reading: Momentum: Why The Bitcoin Train Is Ready To Leave The Station While many altcoins are charting modest gains or losses, Pepe stands out with a remarkable performance. Over the past 48 hours, PEPE has surged by 10%, adding to its impressive weekly gains of 63%. This makes Pepe the second-best performer of the week after Bitcoin Cash. PEPE Sustains Positive Momentum In contrast to the choppy price action seen across the market, Pepe upward momentum remains strong, reflecting positive investor sentiment and demand for the token. This surge in value is particularly noteworthy considering the recent major rally in the market, suggesting that Pepe has managed to sustain and build upon its positive momentum. Looking at the broader market, Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at a critical level of $30,000, with bulls fiercely battling to defend this important psychological and technical support. While Bitcoin has experienced a slight gain of 0.3% in the past 24 hours, it has still recorded a notable weekly gain of 14.4%. Bitcoin’s dominance in the market has also increased, reaching 48% compared to 47.7% the previous day. This indicates that Bitcoin outperforms altcoins, further emphasizing its significance and influence within the market. Related Reading: Stacks (STX) Rallies By 29% In The Past 7 Days – Here’s Why As the week approaches, market participants will closely observe the incoming volume and its potential impact on price movements.

It will be interesting to monitor how Pepe and other cryptocurrencies perform during this period of reduced trading activity. Despite the market’s current challenges, Pepe’s ongoing positive trajectory demonstrates its strength and the growing confidence investors have in its potential for further growth. What’s Next For The Memecoin? Pepe has shown resilience in the market and is expected to reach a maximum price of $0.000003 as the market recovers from the crypto winter. The minimum expected price is projected to be around $0.000002, while the average price will likely hover around $0.000002. These price predictions indicate potential growth and stability for Pepe as market conditions improve and investor confidence returns. Currently, Pepe is valued at $0.00000147 per PEPE/USD, with a market capitalization of $577.58 million USD and a 24-hour trading volume of $622.48 million USD. Although Pepe has experienced a decline of 0.81% in the past 24 hours, it is important to note that the cryptocurrency market can be highly volatile, and price fluctuations are common.

The OP price is currently forming a bullish cup pattern, indicating a potential recovery. Trading activity in the optimism crypto market has surged, suggesting an attempt by the OP price to rebound. Optimism: A Quick Look As a layer-2 blockchain solution, transactions are recorded on the Optimism blockchain and then stored on the Ethereum blockchain. During the development of Optimism’s Layer-2 solution, the focus has been on minimizing complexity. This approach aims to achieve efficient scalability on Ethereum. Its compatibility with the Ethereum network, allows developers to deploy their decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts on the Optimism layer 2 infrastructure. By moving transactions off the Ethereum mainnet, OP aims to reduce transaction costs and alleviate network congestion, making transactions more affordable and efficient for users.
