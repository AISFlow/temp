21298614,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561863,1702339156,How To Take A Long And Short Position In Crypto,"In crypto trading, mastering a long and short position is crucial for success. This guide dives into the essentials like “what is a short position” and “what is covering shorts” as well as strategies for both long & short crypto trading, tailored for traders at all levels. Uncover the strategies behind long positions, aimed at growth and value appreciation, and delve into the subtleties of “going short.” The Basics Of Long/Short Position Crypto Trading Before diving into the specific strategies of long and short crypto trading, it’s essential to grasp the fundamental concepts that govern the cryptocurrency market. Crypto trading, at its core, involves the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, with the aim of generating profit from market fluctuations. Unlike traditional stock markets, the crypto market operates 24/7, offering continuous opportunities but also presenting unique challenges due to its volatility. The Market’s Volatility The cryptocurrency market is known for its high volatility. Prices can dramatically increase or decrease over short periods, making it a potentially lucrative but risky market. This volatility stems from various factors, including market sentiment, regulatory news, technological advancements, and global economic events. Supply And Demand Dynamics Just like any market, crypto trading is driven by supply and demand. The limited supply of certain cryptocurrencies, coupled with increasing demand, can lead to price surges. Conversely, oversupply or waning interest can cause prices to plummet. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for any trader aiming to capitalize on market movements. Trading Platforms And Wallets Crypto traders can use a variety of online platforms to execute their trades. These platforms vary in terms of security, fees, available cryptocurrencies, and user experience. Additionally, traders can trade Bitcoin and crypto in different forms and on different markets. Options are the spot market, the futures and options market, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Exchange Traded Products (ETP) as well as Contracts For Difference (CFDs). Understanding these basic distinctions provides a foundation upon which traders can build more complex strategies, including long and short positions. As we delve deeper into these strategies, keep in mind that crypto trading requires not only an understanding of market trends and behaviors but also a basic technical understanding in order to recognize the value proposition of the respective cryptocurrencies and thus market trends. What Is A Long Position In Crypto? A long position in crypto, often simply referred to as “going long,” is a fundamental strategy where traders invest in a cryptocurrency with the expectation that its value will rise over time. This approach is grounded in a positive outlook on the market’s future performance, making it a cornerstone of traditional investment strategies adapted for the crypto world. When a trader takes a long position, they purchase a cryptocurrency at a certain price, aiming to sell it at a higher price in the future. The difference between the purchase price and the selling price represents the profit. This strategy requires patience and a keen eye for market trends, as the appreciation in value may occur over varying timeframes, from short-term spikes to long-term growth. Successful long positions often depend on thorough market analysis. Traders need to assess various factors, including technological advancements in blockchain, changes in regulatory landscapes, market sentiment, and broader economic indicators that could influence the price of a cryptocurrency. By understanding these factors, traders can make more informed decisions about when to enter a long position. While long positions are generally considered less risky than short positions due to the inherent nature of markets to rise over time, they are not without risks. The volatile nature of the crypto market means that long-term investments can be subject to significant fluctuations. Effective risk management strategies, such as setting stop-loss orders and diversifying portfolios, are crucial in mitigating potential losses. What Is A Short Position In Crypto? Understanding a short position in crypto trading is crucial for traders looking to capitalize on market declines. This strategy, often referred to as “going short,” involves betting against a cryptocurrency’s value, offering a contrast to the more traditional long position approach. When traders go short, they sell a cryptocurrency they don’t own with the expectation of buying it back at a lower price. This begins with borrowing the asset and selling it at the current market price. If the price drops as expected, the trader repurchases the cryptocurrency at this lower rate, returns the borrowed amount, and keeps the difference as profit. This process is commonly known as selling short. The mechanics of a short position are inherently riskier than long positions. The potential for losses is theoretically limitless, as cryptocurrency prices can surge unexpectedly. Thus, short selling demands a deep understanding of market trends and constant vigilance. Timing is crucial in going short. Traders must accurately predict downturns, which can be influenced by various factors, including market sentiment, technical indicators, or external events. However, the volatile and unpredictable nature of the crypto market makes this a challenging endeavor. Notably, a stop loss is also a key instrument for risk-management. A short position in the crypto context signifies a trader’s belief in an impending decrease in a cryptocurrency’s value. It’s not just a defensive strategy to hedge against potential losses but also a proactive approach to profit from market downturns. Despite its risks, seasoned traders often employ short positions as part of a diversified trading strategy, enabling them to leverage opportunities in all market conditions. What Is Covering Shorts? Covering shorts is a critical concept in crypto trading, particularly for those who engage in short selling. It refers to the process of buying back the borrowed cryptocurrency to close out a short position. This action is taken when a trader believes that the price of the cryptocurrency will no longer continue to decline, or to cut losses if the market moves against their prediction. When a trader covers their shorts, they are essentially reversing the initial transaction. They buy the same amount of the cryptocurrency they initially borrowed and sold, aiming to do so at a lower price than they sold it for. This transaction concludes the short selling cycle. If the price is indeed lower, the trader profits from the difference; if higher, the trader incurs a loss. “Market shorts” refer to the collective short positions held in the market. High levels of market shorts can indicate bearish sentiment, suggesting that many traders expect prices to fall. However, this can also lead to a “short squeeze,” where a sudden price increase triggers widespread covering of shorts, further driving up the price. Long Position Vs. Short Position: When To Take It Deciding between a long and a short position in crypto trading depends on several factors, including market analysis, risk tolerance, and investment horizon. Traders should consider the current market trends and potential future developments. A long position might be more suitable in a bullish market or when positive developments are expected in the cryptocurrency space. On the other hand, a short position could be more effective during bearish market conditions or when negative news or trends are anticipated. Short positions generally carry more risk due to the potential for unlimited losses. Traders with a lower risk tolerance may prefer long positions. Conversely, those willing to take on higher risk for potentially greater rewards might opt for short positions. The choice between long and short positions also depends on the trader’s investment timeframe. Long positions are typically associated with a longer-term outlook, while short positions are often suited for short-term trading strategies. Risk Management When Going Short Risk management is particularly crucial when engaging in short selling due to the inherently high-risk nature of this strategy. Stop-Loss-Orders: One of the most important tools in managing risk while short selling is the use of stop-loss orders. These orders can help limit potential losses by automatically closing out a position if the cryptocurrency’s price moves unfavorably to a certain point. Hedging: Traders may also employ hedging strategies to mitigate risks associated with going short. This might involve diversifying their investment portfolio or using financial instruments like options or futures to provide a safety net against potential losses. Capital Management: Effective capital management is essential. This involves only allocating a portion of one’s capital to high-risk strategies like short selling, ensuring that a single bad trade does not significantly impact the overall trading capital. Long/Short Strategies In the volatile arena of crypto trading, long/short strategies are essential for traders to understand. These strategies, which involve navigating between long and short positions, are key to leveraging market movements and managing risk effectively. Comparison: Long Position Vs Short Position In Trading The decision to go long or short in crypto trading fundamentally depends on a trader’s market outlook and strategy. Long Vs. Short Position: A long position is taken with the expectation of a cryptocurrency’s price rising, reflecting a bullish outlook. In contrast, a short position is based on the anticipation of a price decline, indicative of a bearish market perspective. Risk Tolerance: The risk profiles of these positions differ significantly. Long positions, subject to market downturns, have a maximum loss limit (the asset can only drop to zero). Short positions, however, carry potentially unlimited risk, as there’s no cap on how high a cryptocurrency’s price can climb. Shorts vs Longs: The proportion of short positions versus long positions in the market can offer insights into overall market sentiment. A dominance of short positions might indicate bearish sentiment, whereas a prevalence of long positions suggests a bullish market. Leverage When Going Short And Long Leverage is a critical concept in crypto trading, especially when implementing long or short strategies. It allows traders to amplify their trading position beyond their actual capital, potentially increasing profits. However, it also escalates the risks, including the risk of liquidation. Leverage in crypto trading means using borrowed funds to increase a trade’s exposure. For instance, using 10x leverage, a trader can open a position ten times the value of their actual investment. This can significantly amplify profits if the market moves in the trader’s favor. However, it also means that losses are magnified if the market moves against them. A key risk when using leverage is liquidation. Liquidation occurs when the market moves against the leveraged position and the losses exceed the trader’s initial margin (the amount invested in the trade). If a trader’s position is close to being liquidated, they may be required to add more funds to their margin (a “margin call”) or risk having their position automatically closed by the exchange. Long And Short Squeeze A crucial aspect of long/short strategies is understanding the phenomena of long and short squeezes. Short Squeeze: This occurs when a sharp rise in the cryptocurrency’s price compels short sellers to buy back the asset to close their positions, often at a loss. This buying action can further drive up the price, amplifying the squeeze. Long Squeeze: Conversely, a long squeeze happens when a sudden drop in prices forces traders in long positions to sell their holdings, usually to limit losses. This selling pressure can further depress the cryptocurrency’s price. These squeezes are significant market events that can lead to rapid and substantial price movements, impacting both individual trading strategies and overall market dynamics. Position Trader Strategy In Crypto Markets This strategy plays a unique role, often focusing on longer-term trends and strategies. Position Trader Strategies: These traders typically hold their positions over extended periods, basing decisions on long-term market trends rather than short-term fluctuations. This approach requires a deep understanding of market fundamentals and a patient, disciplined investment philosophy. Longer Position Approaches: In taking longer positions, position traders often weather short-term market volatility in anticipation of long-term gains. This strategy demands not only a thorough analysis of the cryptocurrency’s potential but also a steadfast approach to riding out market highs and lows. Practical Guide To Long & Short Crypto Successfully trading cryptocurrencies involves more than understanding market trends; it requires knowing how to effectively execute long and short positions. This practical guide provides insights into the mechanisms of long and short crypto trading, recommends platforms for these trades, and offers a detailed guide to short selling in the crypto world. How To Long And Short Crypto? The process of going long or short in crypto involves several key steps: Market Analysis: Before taking any position, conduct thorough research. Analyze market trends, news, technical indicators, and any other relevant information that could impact the price of the cryptocurrency. Choosing A Position: If your analysis suggests an upcoming rise in the crypto’s value, you would buy (or ‘go long on’) the crypto with the intention of selling it later at a higher price. Conversely, if you anticipate a decrease in value, you would sell the crypto (or ‘go short’), ideally repurchasing it later at a lower price to profit from the difference. Order Execution: Use a crypto trading platform to place your order. For long positions, this will typically be a ‘buy’ order; for short positions, a ‘sell’ order. Advanced traders might use market, limit, or stop orders based on their strategy. Risk Management: Always implement risk management strategies like setting stop-loss orders or only investing what you can afford to lose, especially important in the highly volatile crypto market. Close The Position: Monitor the market closely and close your position when you have achieved your target profit or want to cut a loss. For long positions, this means selling your crypto; for short positions, buying back. Best Crypto Platforms To Long & Short Choosing the right platform is crucial for effective long and short trading. Here’s a list of the most renowned platforms: Binance Futures: Known as the most liquid crypto contract trading platform, Binance Futures offers futures contracts for a wide range of cryptocurrencies. It provides options of cross margin and isolated margin modes, with up to 125x leverage on selected trading pairs.

The trader then aims to buy it back at a lower price, return the borrowed coins, and keep the difference as profit. Explain The Term ‘Short Position Meaning’ In The Context Of Crypto? In the context of crypto, a short position means taking a trading stance where you anticipate a decrease in the cryptocurrency’s value. It involves selling the crypto now to buy it back at a lower price later. What Is The Difference Between Long Vs Short Position? The difference lies in market speculation. Going long is speculating on a price rise, while going short is speculating on a price drop. Both strategies have different risk profiles and market approaches. What Are Long And Short Positions?

A predominance of long positions can indicate bullish market sentiment, while a majority of short positions may signal a bearish outlook. What Is The Difference Between Short Selling And Long Selling? Short selling is selling a borrowed cryptocurrency with the plan to repurchase it at a lower price. Long selling, however, is simply selling a cryptocurrency that you own, expecting that its price will not rise further. What Are Long Positions? Long positions in crypto trading are when traders buy and hold a cryptocurrency, expecting its value to increase over time. What Is A Short In Trading? A short in trading refers to the practice of selling a borrowed asset (like a cryptocurrency) with the intention of buying it back at a lower price. What Does ‘In Short Order’ Mean? ‘In short order’ typically means accomplishing something quickly or within a short period. In trading, it might refer to rapidly executed trades or market movements. What Is Short In Trading? In trading, going short means taking a position that profits from the decline in the price of an asset. How To Long And Short Crypto?

After posting his findings to social media, Dashjr’s warnings were not taken seriously as community members believed it was a non-issue. However, the US government seems to be taking the vulnerability seriously, adding it to its vulnerability database. Dashjr’s Finds Vulnerability In Bitcoin Network Dashjr had first raised alarm about the bug in the Bitcoin network on December 6 through an X (formerly Twitter) post. As the developer explains, this bug was related to the BTC Inscriptions which have gained popularity in the last year. This capability has helped developers to create what could be referred to as Bitcoin’s version of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Related Reading: Solana-Based Meme Coin Outperforms Dogecoin, Shiba Inu To Become 3rd-Largest Elaborating on the mechanism of Ordinals, Dashjr explained that the Inscriptions were actually taking advantage of a vulnerability in the Bitcoin Core. Developers are able to hide their data as program code, thereby being able to bypass the preset limit on the size of extra data that can be included in BTC transactions. Dashjr explained that he was working to fix this issue. However, the vulnerability remains as developers are still able to create inscriptions on the network. Even after being fixed in the “Bitcoin Knots v25.1,” the developer explains that the vulnerability still remains “in the upcoming v26 release.” As for when the vulnerability might be completely fixed, Dashjr said he hopes this will happen sometime in 2024. As Bitcoinist reported, not everyone in the community agreed that this was actually a vulnerability. Some worried that if the ‘vulnerability’ is eventually fixed, Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens would disappear, to which Dashjr responded in the affirmative. BTC price falls below $42,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com NIST Adds BTC Bug To Vulnerability List Despite the Bitcoin community not taking the warning of the vulnerability seriously, the United States government has chosen a more proactive approach. The National Vulnerability Database which is under the government agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), has moved forward to add the vulnerability to its Vulnerability List under ‘Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.’ Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Rises Rapidly In One Week, What’s Been Driving It? The agency has assigned the vulnerability with the code CVE-2023-50428 after identifying that it could be a potential risk for the network, especially when it comes to security or integrity. This means the agency believes this could lead to an exploit in the Bitcoin network. The very existence of Ordinals and BRC-20 tokens is already identified as one of the ways that this vulnerability is already being exploited. Naturally, the agency is looking to prevent other ways in which the vulnerability could be further exploited in a way that could cause harm to its users.

21296404,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564896,1702332029,Galaxy Digital CEO Expresses Bullish Sentiment On XRP,"Galaxy Digital Chief Executive Officer Mike Novogratz has shared his recent optimistic view on XRP, its army, and Ripple, asserting that he was wrong about his earlier skepticism towards them. Related Reading: Analyst Places XRP As The Top Coin For The 2024-2025 Bull Run Mike Novogratz’s Recent View On XRP And Ripple The Galaxy CEO revealed his optimism about the XRP token in a recent podcast known as Real Vision on Sunday. He previously doubted the token’s potential because he believed it would not last in the crypto market. Novogratz stated: I was skeptical that XRP would have lasting power because payment company Ripple owns 60% of XRP, now 55% or 50%. And I was like, ‘That just doesn’t seem a proposition that’s going to work.’ And I’ve been dead wrong. His recent view follows Ripple’s significant court victories over the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2023. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has lost about three times to the crypto firm this year. In October 2021, Novogratz claimed that the asset’s value had tripled since the SEC’s actions. “It’s evidence that communities are incredibly resilient once they are established around shared interests,” he added. Now, Mike Novogratz continued by praising the whole Ripple team and CEO Brad Garlinghouse. In addition, he also recognized Ripple’s development into a powerful player in the payment industry. The Galaxy Digital CEO Confirms XRP’s Army Is “Real” Furthermore, he also gave the “XRP Army” direct recognition, emphasizing the emotional community actively advancing and supporting its ecosystem. He confirmed the reality of the army while noting that they care about their asset and ecosystem. He stated: Hats off to Brad Garlinghouse and his team, Ripple is now an institution. The XRP army is real, they care about their ecosystem and their coin. Novogratz highlighted that the crypto asset presents use cases like Bitcoin (BTC). Due to this, it provides another “alternative for people who want to store value.” Related Reading: Billionaire Mike Novogratz Says Bitcoin At $30,000 Is Unlikely So far, Mike Novogratz’s recent optimism about the asset has generated much interest in its community. Prominent XRP influencer Crypto Eri highlighted Novogratz’s remark regarding the digital asset in a post. In a mocking response to Crypto Eri’s tweet, someone asked whether Novogratz had joined the ranks of XRP investors. He further asked whether he was still “confused” about its mission.

42391782,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwB3t,1702330825,"Bitcoin Dips 7% to Near $40K; Pullback Will Be Short-Lived, Say Experts","Bitcoin tumbled over 7% in the worst daily drawdown since August as crypto markets cool off.  Cryptocurrency prices may rally to new highs into the year-end as the pullback flushed out excess leverage and reset the market, LMAX market strategists said.  Bitcoin [BTC] over the past roughly 24 hours has suffered its steepest daily drawdown in almost four months in a massive leverage wipe-out as traders were reminded of the crypto's occasional steep bull market corrections.  Over the space of a few minutes Sunday evening, BTC plunged to near $40,500 from around $43,800 in what could be termed a ""flash crash."" Prices quickly recovered to $42,400, but then started to slide again during U.S. afternoon hours to as low as $40,200, a level it broke through on the way up a week ago.  At press time, the largest crypto had bounced back above $41,000, still down nearly 7% over the past 24 hours, but on track to be the worst daily drawdown since BTC's drop below $25,000 on August 17.  Ether [ETH], the second largest cryptocurrency, also tumbled over 7% in the same period to below $2,200.  Most of the rest of the cryptocurrencies also suffered large declines, with Ripple-linked [XRP], dogecoin [DOGE], native tokens of Chainlink [LINK] and Cardano [ADA] nursing 8% to 12% losses during the day.  Some altcoins defied the trend, with tokens of Avalanche [AVAX], Injective [INJ] and Optimism [OP] being among the very few gainers.  The CoinDesk Market Index [CMI], which tracks a market capitalization-weighted basket of almost 200 digital assets, was also down over 7%, underscoring heavy declines across the board.  Leverage flush  Sharp drawdowns have been part of every previous bitcoin bull cycle but have been elusive in the past weeks as BTC rose nearly without pause from $27,000 to nearly $45,000 since Oct. 1.  The current correction shouldn't have come as a surprise and was due to happen at some point, bitcoin-focused market analyst Will Clemente said. These pullbacks are necessary to unwind excessive leverage for a more sustainable price action, he added.  ""BTC just [nearly] doubled in 2 months with no pullbacks, a correction is not that surprising,"" Clemente posted. ""Corrections shake out 'weak hands' and leverage, allowing for a stronger foundation for eventual moves higher.""  The decline wiped out over $520 million in leveraged trading positions on the crypto derivatives market, predominantly longs betting on rising prices, CoinGlass data shows. It was the largest level of daily liquidations in at least three months, according to the firm.  Liquidations are forceful closure of a leveraged trading position usually because the trader's margin to cover the open position has run out. Large liquidation events often mark a local top or bottom in prices.  Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, noted that the cascading liquidations of leveraged longs intensified the current sell-off as traders faced margin calls. Additionally, a stronger U.S. dollar might have added to the crypto market weakness.  He said the pullback helped cryptocurrencies come down from overbought levels, and asset prices could continue to rally to new highs.  ""We suspect these dips in bitcoin and ether will be eaten up rather quickly, in favor of higher lows and bullish continuations to new yearly highs,” Kruger said in an emailed note. “The outlook for crypto assets into the year-end remains bright.""",NEUTRAL,ADA | BTC | DOGE,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/11/bitcoin-dips-7-to-near-40k-pullback-will-be-short-lived-say-experts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4ab4453eec45e09ff73574a7c3f5f265e24429f8-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391780,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwAtd,1702328614,Explaining Bitcoin’s ‘Flash Crash’,"Bitcoin [BTC] dropped 7.5% Monday morning, its steepest intraday drop since mid-August. Bitcoin is still up over 150% this year, though the massive, sudden and unexpected “red candle” on the charts is a reminder of the largest cryptocurrency’s volatility.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Last week it seemed like very little could stand in bitcoin’s way, with many of the industry’s long-standing issues seemingly resolved. So why did bitcoin drop today?  It might be better to start at why it was climbing in the first place.  For instance, Binance, the largest and most controversial crypto exchange, agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to U.S authorities to keep operating, a “historic” penalty it seems likely to survive. This settlement also cast the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) legal imbroglio with U.S.-based exchanges Coinbase and Kraken in a better light.  The regulatory front in the U.S., generally speaking, also seems to be easing. If there isn’t yet “regulatory clarity,” (that old industry adage), proposals have been made by high-ranking legislators giving a good indication of what’s likely to come.  There are also predictable events like Bitcoin’s scheduled “halving” next year, when the network literally cuts the amount of BTC that enters into circulation in half, and the potential the SEC approves a bitcoin ETF application. Market watchers have been talking up both events, and the ETF could be said to be the prime driver of bitcoin’s price recently.  Then there are the macroeconomic forecasts. Bitcoin, which is sometimes called “digital gold” because it theoretically could act like a similar store-of-value, has rallied alongside its physical metallic counterpart. Gold futures recently settled at a record end-of-day high, in part driven by inflation concerns.  See also: Crypto's Macro Drivers – It's Not Just About Bitcoin  Interest rates, managed by the Federal Reserve, are at their highest level yet in the 21st century, as the U.S. central bank works to quell inflation and cool an overheated economy. Many experts think the Fed’s work will soon be done, with some saying it may even retrace ground and lower interest rates in the first half of next year.  Lowered interest rates are good for bitcoin in the same way it’s good for economic activity, it “makes money cheaper” by making it cheaper to borrow, which means there is more money around, period. Then, because lower interest rates makes safer investments like government bonds less attractive, by lowering the expected return on investment, that capital then has a way of working its way down the risk curve, towards asset classes like crypto.  I don’t really know what explains today’s “flash crash,” which began with a market correction on Sunday night. Crypto-related stocks like MARA and RIOT dropped double digits today even as tech-heavy equities exchange Nasdaq is on track to gain on the day.  Many, like VDX research lead Greta Yuan, looked to macro forces. On Friday, there was a stronger-than-expected jobs report and the Wall Street Journal’s “Fed Whisperer” Nick Timiraos forecasts that the Fed itself aims to cut rates in 2024. The “minor adjustment” could be explained by “better-than-expected nonfarm payroll and lower unemployment,"" she said.  See also: There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good Thing  Meanwhile, Lucy Hu, a Metalpha senior analyst, told CoinDesk last night it could be part of a “rational process of profit-taking,” meaning that traders essentially made as much as they wanted and decided to cash out. CoinDesk’s market watcher Omkar Godbole called funding rates in crypto derivatives “overheated.”  While the amount of leverage in crypto derivatives markets may not explain the first mover problem of knowing what, if anything, caused a market correction, it certainly does help explain how an asset could drop so far so quickly. Godbole also used phrases like “excess bullish leverage” and “overcrowding of long positions.”  When traders are overleveraged, they’re essentially trading borrowed money. That means that they’re helping to inflate asset prices with capital that doesn’t really exist and also that if prices drop they can be wiped out (aka liquidated) with a far bigger impact on the wider market. Leverage is great until it isn’t.  What this also means is, for better or worse, the amount of leverage has also been reset to something healthier. And let it be a lesson to you, dear reader, that in crypto, especially when everything seems to be working in your favor, that prices can swing on a hiccup. So be sane, and recognize that volatility cuts both ways…",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/12/11/explaining-bitcoins-flash-crash,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5eb924732df36e5537d22b5bcc27df6ac806ee54-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21295238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564868,1702328442,Shiba Inu Vs LUNC Burn: Which One Has Had A Better Impact?,"Both the Shiba Inu and the LUNC tokens have seen their growth hindered by the fact that their circulating supply is incredibly large. As a way to curb this, both communities have come up with a burn initiative to reduce the supply of the tokens as much as possible. So far, there have been significant amounts of tokens sent to burn addresses by members of the community. But which community’s effort has had the best impact on the token price? LUNC Community Hits 85 Billion Mark The LUNC community burn has gained a lot of traction since it began around a year ago. Every week, millions of tokens are being taken out of circulation in an effort to reduce its over 5.8 trillion supply. This has resulted in tens of billions of tokens being burned so far. According to the LUNC Metrics website, the community has been able to hit the 85 billion tokens burned milestone. This was hit after over 1.7 billion tokens were burned by the community in a single-week timeframe, bringing the total all-time token burned to approximately 85 billion. On the back of this milestone, the prices of LUNC and USTC have begun to rally once more, suggesting a correlation between the burn and the price performance. Not only the Terra Classic ecosystem tokens are rallying but also the rebranded LUNA token has been on the rise. The LUNC burn initiative has seen a lot of support from the Binance exchange which continues to burn fees generated from the altcoin’s trading activity. Burning has also extended to the USTC token which sees thousands of coins burned daily. SHIB bulls show strength | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com Shiba Inu Burn Sees 2875% Explosion Compared to the LUNC burn, the Shiba Inu community burn has had more impact on the price. Unlike LUNC, around 45% of the total token supply has been burned. Most of this can be attributed to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin who received half of the SHIB token supply in 2021. Buterin eventually burned the majority of the tokens after donating some of it to a COVID relief fund. The community has, however, not relented in its efforts to reduce the supply. Last week, the burn rate saw one of the most significant spikes after rising over 7.6 million percent in a 24-hour period. This increased burn momentum has continued into the new week with Sunday’s figures coming in over 152 million tokens burned. This 152 million figure saw the SHIB burn rate rise another 2875%, data from Shibburn shows, starting the week off on a high note. The majority of the burned tokens came from a single wallet which incinerated 107.6 million tokens in a single transaction. However, unlike LUNC, the spike in the SHIB burn rate hasn’t seemed to have affected the price much with the token trading at near breakeven for the same time period.

21294088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564869,1702324845,Bitcoin Price In Turmoil: Major Events That Could Affect Price This Week,"The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is currently flying high on the back of potential approval of the pending Spot Bitcoin ETF applications in January. However, this upward trend could cool off as this prominent crypto analysis platform outlined key events that are set to happen this week. “Huge Week Ahead” For Bitcoin In a post shared on their X (formerly Twitter) platform, The Kobeissi Letter noted that the November CPI Inflation data is coming in this week. Specifically, it is set to be released on December 12. Meanwhile, The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is scheduled to meet on December 12 and 13. These two events are significant for Bitcoin’s price. The CPI inflation data is usually a factor in the FOMC’s decision on whether or not to increase interest rates in its fight against inflation. A dovish stance is seen as bullish for the markets (including Bitcoin), while a hawkish one usually affects the market negatively. Therefore, all eyes will be on the inflation data and whether or not the FOMC will choose to raise the interest rates. The Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had recently stated that talks about rate cuts are still “premature,” although he admitted that “inflation is moving in the right direction.” The financial markets reacted positively to Powell’s remarks, with many experts of the opinion that the Feds are raising the interest rates and would possibly stick to the current rates between the range of 5.25 to 5.50 percent. If that happens, there is a high chance that Bitcoin’s price will react positively to it. BTC price recovers above $42,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Other Inflation Indicators To Watch Out For The OPEC Monthly Report and November Producer Price Index (PPI) Inflation data are also set to be released on December 13. These two events are also known to have a significant effect on Bitcoin’s price as they are key inflation indicators. For one, the OPEC monthly report contains issues affecting the world oil market. It will also show whether there has been a significant increase in oil prices and the key supply and demand metric. An increase in oil prices could be bad news for Bitcoin as this would mean that inflation is still on the high which could lead to higher interest rates. The PPI inflation data is also key. Some even argue that it is more important than the CPI inflation data since the producers indirectly determine how much consumers pay for these goods. An increase in the PPI inflation data also suggests that inflation is on the high. That would also be a factor when the Feds decide whether to raise interest rates or not. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $42,100, down by over 3% according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This surge in interest has propelled INJ to the second-most mentioned token on social media, trailing only Bitcoin (BTC). Injective Social Media Activity Rising Specifically, data reveals that INJ received nearly 30% of its weekly mentions in the past 24 hours alone. Furthermore, 37% of all monthly mentions of INJ occurred in the past seven days, further highlighting the growing attention surrounding the project. While this is impressive for the project, it seems like INJ is also popular, looking at the very short-term data over the past trading day. Looking at weekly and monthly mentions, Solana, Avalanche, and Ethereum are ahead. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Short-Term XRP Price Rally To $18 The uptick in Injective Protocol’s social activity also coincides with expanding prices. Based on Alpha Scan data, INJ has outpaced Bitcoin and other top 10 crypto assets in the last data. If the spike in social activity is behind rising prices, INJ may likely extend gains in subsequent sessions. From the INJ daily chart, the coin is at 2023 highs, ripping even higher. As it is, the coin is within a bullish breakout formation, comprehensively easing past November 2023 resistance levels. Of note, the rally is with expanding trading volumes, meaning the leg up is supported and could continue, further drawing more social activity to the project. Injective Protocol is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform that operates on a layer-2 solution, allowing faster and more scalable trading than traditional DEXs. It supports various decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, including derivatives trading and synthetic asset issuance. Is INJ On The Cusp Of Exploding Above $25? The growing interest in Injective Protocol is likely due to a combination of factors. Beyond the project’s unique features, like near-gasless transactions and growing adoption, improving crypto sentiment and strategic partnerships might have supported prices and revived social media activity. To illustrate, Injective recently joined Google Cloud, encouraging developers to build on the platform. Related Reading: Bitcoin $42,000 Support Under Pressure As Short Position Inflows Soar Despite the current optimism, it is not immediately clear whether the spike in social media activity could be a precursor to more price gains for INJ. Even so, with the coin trending at new 2023 highs and trading volumes expanding amid a broader recovery across the crypto scene, it is likely that INJ may explode to record new all-time highs above $25.

According to numbers provided by CCData, Binance's market share so far in December was just 30.1% versus 55% at the start of the year. From January to September, the exchange’s monthly spot volumes declined by over 70% from $474 billion to $114 billion. CCData does note that Binance has begun to see a boost in monthly trading volumes since September even as its market share continued to slide.  The company in November and its now former CEO CZ agreed to pay nearly $3 billion to settle a U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission lawsuit. This came alongside separate settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice and Treasury Department.  In addition to the exit of its CEO, the company also witnessed a large number of executive departures this year, including its Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann, Senior Director of Investigations Matthew Price and U.K. chief Jonathan Farnell.  Despite Binance’s decline in spot trading market share over the year, it still remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange by a wide margin. In second place to Binance's 30% is Seychelles-based OKX, which has seen its market share grow to 8% in December from around 4% to start the year, according to CCData.  The numbers are similar when looking at combined spot and derivatives trading, where Binance saw a decline in market share to 42% from 60% while OKX's grew to 21% from 9%.",NEGATIVE,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/11/binances-market-share-of-crypto-trading-tumbled-to-30-in-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8dc2c7a6e11ecc6536f94d0663d6b94d14504776-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391785,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwAeF,1702317662,"FCA Slow to Take Crypto Enforcement Action, UK's Public Spending Watchdog Says","The U.K's Nationa Audit Office said the country's financial regular is slow to take enforcement action against companies breaking rules.  It highlighted the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA) delays in registering crypto firms and taking action against crypto ATMs as examples.  The U.K.'s public spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, has said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is slow to take enforcement action, pointing to its handling of crypto firms over the years.  While U.S. regulators recently made headlines for a $4 billion settlement with the world's largest crypto exchange, Binance, the U.K. has proceeded slowly by comparison.  ""Even when an issue falls inside the FCA’s perimeter, or it has the power to act, it can take years for the FCA to implement any enforcement action,"" the NAO said in a Friday report.  The FCA has required crypto firms to register to comply with the country's anti-money laundering regulations since January 2020. Although it then began supervision work, including engaging with unregistered firms, ""it did not begin taking enforcement action against illegal operators of crypto ATMs until February 2023,"" according to the report.  ""The FCA reported publicly that it saw a significant drop of 68% in reported crypto ATM activities in 2022, although not all of this could be attributed to FCA activity,"" the report said.  The financial regulator has consistently faced criticism from the crypto industry over the slow processing of registration applications. According to the report, the FCA blames its lack of speed on poor staff retention.  ""The FCA has found recruitment and retention of staff with crypto compliance skills is difficult due to competition between employers for people with these skills,"" the report said.  The report also noted that the FCA has dealt with 1,400 cases related to unregulated crypto activity between January 2020 and June 2023.  The FCA received additional powers over the crypto sector with the passing of the Financial Services and Markets Bill early this year, which recognized crypto and stablecoins as regulated financial services and has begun to use its new powers.

BONK Has Formed A TD Sequential Sell Signal On Its Weekly Chart As explained by analyst Ali in a post on X, the same indicator that signaled the latest rally for BONK is now predicting a decline for the cryptocurrency instead. The metric in question is the “Tom Demark (TD) Sequential,” which is generally used for pinpointing probable tops and bottoms in any asset’s price. The indicator gives such a reversal signal after nine candles of the same type are following a previous top/bottom in the asset. This nine-candle phase is called the “setup.” Related Reading: 63.2% Of PEPE Holders Now In Profit: How This Compares With DOGE, SHIB If the setup completes with nine red candles, then the TD Sequential suggests a likely buying point, while green candles imply the asset might have encountered a top. A TD Sequential setup has been completed for memecoin BONK on its weekly price chart just recently. Here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows this pattern in the cryptocurrency: Looks like the signal has completed with green candles recently | Source: @ali_charts on X As displayed in the above graph, the weekly BONK price has completed a TD Sequential setup phase with green candles recently as the asset has been enjoying a sharp rally. Ali notes that a few months ago, the same indicator had presented a buy signal for the meme coin, which ended up leading to the current rally. So far, the asset has enjoyed profits of more than 8,400% during this run. The analyst thinks based on the latest TD Sequential sell signal, BONK may be heading towards a correction period that could last anywhere from one to four weeks. The Dog-Based Coin Has Registered A Rise Of Over 18% During The Past Day During the weekend, BONK continued its recent bullish momentum and made a push above the $0.00001487 mark, but the meme coin soon noticed a sharp correction as it plunged to $0.00000996. The bulls appear to be back for the coin, though, as it has seen a rapid 18% recovery in the last 24 hours, reclaiming the $0.00001237 level. The below chart shows how the token has performed during the past month. The price of the asset appears to have gone through a sharp rally in this period | Source: BONKUSD on TradingView BONK is still a decent distance from making a full retrace towards its top, however, so it’s hard to say anything about whether this fresh rally is going to last for any sizeable period. Related Reading: Hold Your Horses: Bitcoin Could Fall Back To Under $38,000, These Analysts Say And given the TD Sequential sell signal in the weekly chart, it’s possible that this recovery surge is just a dead-cat bounce, and BONK will be heading down from here instead. At present, the meme coin is up more than 364% during the past month and stands third on the top meme coins by market cap list, meaning that it’s only smaller than Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) in total valuation.

In a Dec. 7 speech, Chu said the bank's focus is now on conducting surveys to gather feedback from the public, government agencies, industry and academia on improving the design of a CBDC platform.  Jurisdictions worldwide are considering the merits of CBDCs for interbank and retail payments, bolstered by a green light from the global central bank group, the Bank for International Settlements.

The country has been ramping up regulation of the industry in recent months.  The rules do not cover non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) has proposed rules to protect the customers of virtual asset services providers (VASPs), the regulator said on Monday.  The rules, which come under the Virtual Asset User Protection Act passed earlier this year, are scheduled to take effect on July 19, 2024. They are open for public comment until Jan. 22.  The Act defines digital assets and provides statutory grounds for sanctions, including criminal penalties and fines ""to punish unfair trading activities using virtual assets."" It also requires VASPs, or exchanges, to monitor abnormal transactions and alert the FSC when appropriate.  South Korea has been ramping up its efforts to regulate the crypto sector in recent months. In July, the FSC announced draft rules that will require companies to disclose if they own or hold crypto starting next year.  Under the incoming rules, VASPs must pay fees to customers for using their deposits. When exchanges store their assets in banks, the banks are allowed to invest the deposits in safe assets like government bonds.  The rules also require exchanges to store 80% or more of customers' deposits in cold wallets. A cold wallet is a crypto wallet that is not permanently online and is less vulnerable to cyberattacks.

21289775,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564891,1702312201,"Bitcoin $42,000 Support Under Pressure As Short Position Inflows Soar","Bitcoin (BTC) recently experienced a sharp decline, tumbling towards $40,000 amid a broader sell-off across the cryptocurrency market. While the most significant token managed to recover some losses, currently trading 4% lower at $42,000, concerns persist regarding the potential for further downside price action before a potential recovery. Investors Show Caution With Short-BTC Position Inflows According to a recent CoinShares report, digital asset investment products witnessed their 11th consecutive week of inflows, totaling $43 million. Notably, there was a significant increase in short position inflows due to recent price appreciation and perceived downside risks. Europe led with $43 million in inflows, followed by the US with $14 million (with half in short positions). On the other hand, Hong Kong and Brazil experienced outflows of $8 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Related Reading: Avalanche Rules Top 10 Ranking With 61% Weekly Gain – Here’s The Scoop Bitcoin remained the primary focus for investors, attracting $20 million in inflows, bringing the year-to-date inflows to $1.7 billion. Short-Bitcoin positions saw $8.6 million in inflows, suggesting some investors view the current price rises as unsustainable. Ethereum (ETH) also saw increased interest, with its sixth week of inflows totaling $10 million, marking a turnaround from previous outflows. Selling Pressure Mounts As Miners Decrease Bitcoin Holdings According to Satoshi Club, there are indications that miners are selling their Bitcoin holdings following the recent price drop. Data shows a significant decrease in miners’ BTC holdings, with increasing flows to exchanges, suggesting selling pressure in the market. Satoshi Club’s analysis highlights that this trend could be attributed to the anticipated halving in 2024, which will reduce miners’ rewards by half. Additionally, Bitcoin’s net unrealized profit/loss, which indicates the investor profit ratio, has surpassed 0.5 for the first time since December 2021. This suggests that a significant portion of Bitcoin investments are currently profitable, potentially leading to increased selling pressure at current price highs. BTC’s Bullish Structure Intact, But Deep Correction Threatens Run In the 1-day chart for Bitcoin, the current trading price is closely aligned with a support level. Despite briefly dipping below this level, Bitcoin has managed to recover and trade above it, mitigating further declines. However, in the event of continued selling pressure and an inability to maintain its current price level, Bitcoin’s next critical level of support would be $39,990. It is worth noting that during the previous hype surrounding Bitcoin’s milestone, many traders entered long positions below the current levels. This influx of long positions could trigger a liquidation hunt before a recovery ensues. If such a scenario unfolds, the hunt for liquidations could drive Bitcoin’s price further down, potentially testing support levels at $38,700 and $37,800. Related Reading: Why Is Ethereum Price Down To $2,200 Today? On a positive note, Bitcoin’s current bullish structure would remain intact unless a significant correction occurs, pushing the price below the $29,900 level. This level began Bitcoin’s current bull run in late October. The future outcome hinges on whether Bitcoin can successfully hold its nearest support levels and facilitate a recovery that shifts the focus from hunting long positions to hunting short sellers, eventually regaining previously conquered territories.

This comes as the crypto token’s underperformance has been a cause of concern to holders, with talks about a potential manipulation resounding through the community. XRP Price To Hit $18 In The Short-Term In a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, crypto analyst Dark Defender shared an interesting analysis where he noted that XRP could hit $18 soon enough. To back up his prediction, he noted that XRP was retesting the $0.6649. According to him, this level is “not a joke” as it is a very crucial one. An upward trend is expected from that price level based on his assertions. Related Reading: Crypto Market Experts Predict When Cardano (ADA) Price Will Cross $7 Meanwhile, Dark Defender also shared XRP’s monthly chart in his post. From the chart, he noted that XRP was currently above the price level of $0.6649, which he had earlier referenced. This happening could see XRP move close to $1. On the chart, he highlighted $0.88 and $1.05 as targets that will be “achievable shortly.” The rally, however, doesn’t stop there, as the crypto analyst claimed the “5 Wave EW Structure in the Monthly Chart is still in play.” This indicator points to XRP hitting $18.22 in the short mid-term. The journey to $18 isn’t expected to be all smooth, as he mentioned that XRP would face a strong resistance at $1.08. The good news is that once XRP is able to break from that level, “it will be Kaboom,” in the words of Dark Defender. As to how soon XRP could hit $18, the accompanying chart suggests that this could happen between July and October 2024. Token price falls to $0.62 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com A Growing Frustration In The XRP Community? Over the weekend, a pro-XRP crypto influencer, Chloe, released an X post where she voiced her frustration at XRP’s price decline and stated that she had “sold it all.” Before that post suggesting that she had sold her XRP holdings, she had made an earlier post where she seemed very displeased with XRP’s price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Signal Returns: Exchange Supply Hits Lowest Level Since 2017 Although Chloe later came out to clarify that she didn’t sell any “single XRP,” her earlier posts exemplify the growing frustration in the XRP community. At the moment, many seem puzzled by XRP’s abysmal price action. One of them is pro-XRP legal expert Bill Morgan, who recently questioned the reason for XRP’s underperformance. In an X post, the lawyer stated that XRP has failed to outperform most of the other tokens in the top 10 by market cap despite gaining regulatory clarity. Interestingly, he noted that XRP’s price was higher five years ago than it is now. According to Morgan, there needs to be a better explanation for XRP’s price movement than just “saying it follows the market.” Featured image from CoinGape, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,ADA | XRP,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-analyst-xrp-price-18/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/21287868.jpeg

Uniswap version 3 (v3) has been deployed on Rootstock by GFX Labs, the team behind trading terminal Oku, according to an emailed announcement shared with CoinDesk on Monday. According to Uniswap's website, the project, originally designed for Ethereum, has also been deployed on the Ethereum layer-2 networks Arbitrum, Optimism and Polygon.  Oku will provide Rootstock with trading tools that incorporate analytics, limit orders and liquidity provider position management.  The combination of Ethereum-based Uniswap's smart contract capabilities with the security of Bitcoin's proof-of-work network could bring deeper liquidity and more DeFi uses cases to the crypto industry.  ""Rootstock's combination of Bitcoin's security and Ethereum's smart contract capabilities, now augmented with Uniswap v3, introduces a new dimension of on-chain swaps, liquidity depth and yield opportunities on Bitcoin's network,"" according to the press release.  In May, developers deployed Uniswap smart contracts onto the Bitcoin network to capitalize on the rise of BRC-20 – a token standard to enable the issuance of tokens and therefore DeFi applications on Bitcoin.  This year has seen various elements of blockchain networks more commonly associated with Ethereum and others find their way to Bitcoin, not least the Ordinals protocol, which brought non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to the world's largest blockchain.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value, lost ground on Monday after reaching yearly highs last week. Bitcoin fell 3% in the last 24 hours to trade around $42,400 after hitting $45,000 last week. There are a number of factors for the drop in price, with some analysts attributing it to macroeconomic fundamentals. Friday’s economic data from the U.S. came in strong, with better-than-expected nonfarm payrolls and lower employment. The dollar rallied and bitcoin dropped slightly immediately after. The pullback could also stem from investors taking profits after last week's gains. Looking ahead, LMAX Digital said in a note to investors that the outlook for crypto assets into year-end “remains bright.” “We suspect these dips in bitcoin and ether will be eaten up rather quickly, in favor of higher lows and bullish continuations to new yearly highs,” the note said.  Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs brought forward its estimate for the Federal Reserve's first interest-rate cut to third-quarter 2024 from a previous forecast of the fourth quarter, Reuters reported Monday. The shift comes as bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market has surged in recent weeks on a bullish cocktail of an expected spot ETF launch in the U.S., the impending Bitcoin mining reward halving and the decline in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, the so-called risk-free rate. The Fed's benchmark interest rate is currently 5.25% to 5.5%, with traders of the Fed funds futures anticipating a decline to a range starting at 4% by the end of the next year.  Cathie Wood's ARK Invest sold another 335,860 shares in cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) on Friday, its largest sale since July. ARK offloaded COIN shares across three exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The bulk came from the Innovation ETF (ARKK). The sale would have raised $49.2 million at Coinbase's closing price. The St. Petersburg, FL-based investment manager has been making consistent sales of Coinbase stock in recent weeks as the exchange's shares have appreciated alongside bitcoin's rally. Friday's is the largest since July, when it sold 480,000 shares worth $50.5 million at the time.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the best-performing cryptocurrencies of the past 24 hours.  Smaller coins like INJ, BONK, BIGTIME, JOE and others have risen over 10%, showing resilience amid bitcoin's price drop.  It's a sign the recent bull market in bitcoin is spreading to the smaller altcoin sector.

ARK offloaded COIN shares across three exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The bulk came from the Innovation ETF (ARKK). The sale would have raised $49.2 million at Coinbase's closing price.  The St. Petersburg, FL-based investment manager has been making consistent sales of Coinbase stock in recent weeks as the exchange's shares have appreciated alongside bitcoin's rally. Friday's is the largest since July, when it sold 480,000 shares worth $50.5 million at the time.  ARK adopts a target weighting for its ETFs, where individual composite holdings' weightings don't dip below 2% of the value of the fund nor exceed 10%. The recent rally in COIN stock, which has reached highs not seen since April 2022, means its weighting in the three ETFs has been comfortably in excess of 10%.  Even with the recent sales, COIN accounts for more than 11% of ARKK and the Next Generation ETF (ARKW) and over 13% of the Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF).  COIN closed on Friday at $146.62, up 7.66% on the day.  ARK also sold 102,672 shares in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), worth around $3.6 million. GBTC accounts for 8.33% of ARKW.

21281212,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564851,1702287910,"Why Is Ethereum Price Down To $2,200 Today?","The Ethereum price has been among the worst hit in the flash crash that took place on Monday. The crash sent the asset’s price down below $2,200 for the first time in the last week and has continued to trend low around this point. As the market shows a bit of recovery momentum, questions remain about what could have triggered the crash. Ethereum Price Fell Because Whales Have Been Selling One of the most obvious causes of the flash crash that affected the Ethereum price is the fact that large holders have been selling. This month, ETH hit its highest level in the last year and this sent a lot of investors back into profit. Now, since there has not been a complete bullish turnover of the crypto market, there are expectations that the market could crash and investors are trying to secure profits before this happens. Related Reading: Crypto Market Experts Predict When Cardano (ADA) Price Will Cross $7 Crypto analyst Ali Martinez flagged the selling from these large holders in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday. According to him, these large holders had actually begun selling when the price had first crossed $2,300. This means that the selling pressure had been mounting for a while before being reflected in the price. The whales who hold more than 10,000 ETH in their balances had been reducing their holdings toward the end of November. By December, their holdings had fallen to their lowest point in the last three months, showing proof of massive sell-offs by these whales. ETH price at $2,242 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Uncertainty About Macro Factors Macroeconomic uncertainty has also played a role in the crypto crash that sent the Ethereum price to $2,200. One example of this is the CPI data release that is expected to take place on Tuesday. As investors eagerly await the results from the announcement, market fluctuations are expected. Related Reading: Why Is XRP Price Up Today? Ripple’s Massive Buyback May Have The Answer The November inflation data is also expected to be released this week, as well as the Fed’s decision and statement happening on Monday. Ahead of these events, high volatility is always expected as investors move to secure some of their positions. Nevertheless, Ethereum has begun to show some bullish momentum once more. It has since bounced from its lows of $2,170 and is back up above $2,000, where bulls are already providing a lot of support. If Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, Ethereum could reclaim the $2,300 level before the day is over. The price of ETH is sitting at $2,238 at the time of this writing, down 4.50% in the last 24 hours.

The Fed's benchmark interest rate is currently 5.25% to 5.5%, with traders of the Fed funds futures anticipating a decline to a range starting at 4% by the end of the next year.

Bitcoin typically embarks on a long-term bull cycle 6 to 12 months after each halving event, with some forecasts predicting prices climbing to over $100,000 by late 2024. Hut 8 Corp. presents a compelling investment opportunity with its balanced business model, material bitcoin exposure, and diversification into other revenue streams. The Investment Thesis In 2024, many uncertainties lie ahead as the United States presidential election process unfolds and the potential for economic recession or slowdown looms. The outcomes of both the election and the economy are far from certain. However, one factor that I anticipate with confidence is the rise of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices. Although nationwide and worldwide conditions outside of the cryptocurrency sector may become volatile or turbulent, the underlying value of BTC will prove to be resilient. Over time, as institutional adoption of BTC continues increasing and its perception shifts from a niche asset to a recognized store of value, I expect market demand and valuation will ascend accordingly. Amidst pervasive ambiguity in other market, the growth trajectory of BTC will provide an oasis of certainty in 2024. Three Pillars of Support in 2024 There are three foundational factors underpinning my belief that BTC prices will rise meaningfully in 2024: The 4th BTC halving event is scheduled for 17 April 2024. This will reduce the block reward from 6.25 BTC to 3.175 BTC, decreasing new BTC supply entering circulation. In 2024, we may see regulatory transparency regarding BTC exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with over 10 potential ETF filings . This could pave the way for increased institutional investment into BTC. Over 92.8% of BTC has already been mined , with approximately 1.5 million BTC remaining. This exponential dwindling of future supply lends scarcity value. According to basic economic principles of demand and supply dynamics, a notable cut to new supply coupled with incremental demand growth should inherently increase market pricing. Furthermore, as valuations rise post-halving, this fosters a positive feedback loop - higher prices incentivize additional mining to take advantage of network transaction fees, driving further demand for existing circulating coin and putting upward pressure on prices. While immediate post-halving effects may be muted, history demonstrates BTC typically embarks on a long-term bull cycle 6 to 12 months after each halving event. Several analysts forecast prices climbing to over $100,000 or higher by late 2024. For investors seeking exposure, companies most directly leveraged to BTC's success include miners, whose top-line revenues and margins expand dramatically in an appreciating market, as well as cryptocurrency exchanges benefiting from trading volume growth. Of these, I view miners as the purest play, with earnings essentially acting as a proxy for BTC's price performance. Their shares could outperform meaningfully should an expected resurgence in the crypto sector take hold. Evaluating the Risk While BTC mining companies stand to benefit immensely from rising prices in 2024, there are some notable challenges to consider. BTC mining is a highly capital-intensive endeavor that requires significant investment in GPUs to increase hash rate and maximize coin production. However, with each halving event, rewards are cut substantially, meaning miners must exponentially grow their hashing power just to maintain pre-halving output levels. These further drives up electricity costs and maintenance expenses. Additionally, the environmental impact of large-scale BTC mining has garnered significant scrutiny . As the global hash rate climbs, energy consumption also grows exponentially. Some estimates indicate BTC mining currently uses around 150 terawatt-hours of electricity annually - more than many medium-sized countries. Critics argue this threatens decarbonization efforts and climate targets. Transitioning existing operations to renewable energy also presents cost and logistical hurdles. Regulators have taken notice - China previously dominated due to inexpensive coal but has since banned mining over environmental concerns. Other jurisdictions may follow suit without meaningful progress on sustainability. While miners are exploring renewable solutions like solar, scaling green energy infrastructure requires extensive long-term investment. Technical debates also question BTC's ability to properly incentivize sustainability at its current scale. Overall, responsibly managing this growing environmental footprint remains a paramount long-term risk if regulatory restrictions are to be avoided. Mitigation For these reasons, in my opinion miners should diversify beyond solely focusing on BTC extraction. Relying exclusively on a single volatile asset class is risky, as proven during the steep crypto market declines when prices plunged to just slightly above US$16k, rendering mining unprofitable and even causing some firms to become insolvent. During such periods dubbed ""crypto winters"", miners were often forced to liquidate their holdings just to stay afloat. A better strategy is for companies to develop diverse revenue streams in fiat currencies to weather downturns. Additionally, HODLing some portion of mined BTC according to a set strategy, rather than constant selling, allows benefits from upside appreciation potential. Those able to retain holdings have an opportunity to leverage them for loans or sell during future bull markets. In summary, the ideal miner exposure for investors like myself seeking BTC upside is one with a balanced model featuring both fiat income diversification and a BTC HODLing policy. This mitigates risk while maintaining linkage to BTC price performance over the long term. My Ideal Miner Hut 8 Corp. ( HUT ) presents a compelling investment opportunity premised on a balanced business model and material BTC exposure. Recently merging with US Bitcoin Corp, HUT has strategically expanded beyond sole reliance on mining operations for its revenue with numerous opportunity to earn fiat income. The acquisition of TeraGo's five data center facilities in Toronto in early 2022 introduced a profitable high-performance computing segment into its portfolio. Post-merger, HUT will enter the burgeoning management services division, catering to crypto miners such as Marathon Digital ( MARA ), Foundry, Sphere 3D ( ANY ), Decimal Group, and TeslaWatt. Both segments contributes a steady flow of fiat income to HUT. HUT Dec 2023 Presentation HUT has experienced significant growth in its mining hashrate, effectively tripling it to reach 7.5 exahashes per second (EH/s). While this expansion is noteworthy, HUT's anticipated year-end 2023 rate remains relatively average compared to its peers, such as MARA, Riot Blockchain ( RIOT ), and Core Scientific ( CORZQ ), who are targeting or achieving mining hashrates between 10-17 EH/s. However, the escalation of hashrate appears to be of lesser importance in HUT's future strategy. Instead, the management's focus has shifted towards diversifying revenue sources by generating fiat income. This prudent approach positions the company well for the upcoming BTC block reward halving, scheduled to take place in just five months. In terms of maintaining exposure to the potential growth of BTC price, HUT currently holds an impressive amount of over 9,366 BTC, placing it among the top 20% of global BTC holders. If BTC reaches the projected price target of $100k, the value of this stake alone would increase to $936 million, excluding the core mining operations and diversified fiat revenue streams. During the investor's call on 4 Dec 2023, management indicated that the current net worth of the company is $497 million. The diversified fiat revenue is expected to contribute 30% to the projected 2023 income, amounting to over $45 million out of the total of $152.4 million. With the aforementioned positive factors, HUT solidifies its position as a leading miners play, poised to leverage the anticipated 2024 BTC bull market. HUT Dec 2023 Presentation Other Potential Catalyst Going Into 2024 US Bitcoin Corp has recently secured a deal to acquire mining assets from the bankrupt lender, Celsius. As per the deal, the company will become the “exclusive operator” of the Celsius mining fleet and will receive a $15 million annual management fee for the mining assets, net of operating expenses, for five years. This arrangement positions HUT to garner an additional $15 million in fiat revenue annually for 5 years. On the other hand, HUT is also exploring diversification into the energy sector by placing a “ stalking horse bid ” to acquire certain assets of Validus, its former power supplier to its BTC mining facility in North Bay. If successful, this strategic bid would result in 80% ownership of a new power business and put an end to all litigation claims and counterclaims between HUT and Validus. Risk Relating to Investment Into HUT Beyond the risks associated with investing in a BTC mining firm discussed previously, a primary concern for an investment in HUT at the present juncture relates to post-merger management alignment and strategic cohesion. It is important to note that this merger combined two distinct companies, resulting in a sizeable leadership contingent comprising 5 C-level executives, 7 senior managers, and 7 Board of Directors. Potential challenges arise in unifying strategic vision and decision-making if behaviors such as clashing of ego and differing visions appears. At the extremes, irreconcilable discord could potentially lead to a disruptive breakup of the combined company. More likely, moderate dissonance might slow the pace of initiative development as competing agendas vie for prioritization. Therefore, attentiveness to cohesive team-building and unitary strategic communication will be paramount to mitigate the threats to integration and performance inherent in fusing multiple established organizational cultures under joint leadership. Successful alignment of this expanded management system remains a prominent risk factor warranting ongoing monitoring. Valuation Valuing BTC mining companies presents challenges due to historical volatility across crypto market cycles. To establish more robust valuation benchmarks, I will analyze HUT with a peer group of established miners with stable business profiles spanning multiple years - ( HIVE ), ( MARA ), ( BITF ), and ( RIOT ). Taking the median price-to-sales ((PS)) and price-to-book ((PB)) ratios across this peer cohort over time yields more representative benchmarks. Based on HUT's stated $152.4 million pro forma revenue and $497 million net worth post-merger, applying these multiples provides target valuation ranges. Using information from Macrotrend's website , the median PS ratio was 8.71x. At 8.71x HUT's $152.4 million revenue points to a market cap of $1.327 billion. Meanwhile, the median PB of 2.16x applied to its $497 million book value equates to a market cap of $1.073 billion. As revealed by Sue Ennis, the Investor Relations executive of HUT, in her X account, that HUT currently has 88 million shares outstanding post-merger, this implies a per share value between $12.19 - $15.08 currently - representing upside of 19%-47% (against $10.25 as of 12 Oct 2023). Sue Ennis X Account It is important to note this does not incorporate potential synergies from integration, additional income streams such as managing Celsius assets, or prospective energy segment revenues. Moreover, the valuation excludes the enormous appreciation possible if BTC reaches $100k, equating to $936 million in value from HUT's 9,366 BTC reserves alone. Adopting peer-derived, multi-year valuation metrics provides a foundation for HUT's potential in 2024. Upside drivers leave significant room for outperformance as the mining sector prepares to capture BTC's anticipated bull market in 2024. Closing Thoughts All evidence points to 2024 being a watershed year for BTC, as the 4th halving is programmed to constrict new supply entering circulation amid burgeoning institutional adoption propelling prices to new heights. Miners afford the most direct play on the coin's returns, though navigating industry volatility, capital intensity and sustainability necessitates balance. HUT stands out through acquisitions expanding businesses and holdings, positioning itself at the vanguard of resilient miners poised to maximally leverage the anticipated bull market. Therefore, with its diversified revenue streams buttressing pure-play exposure, HUT represents my highest conviction investment to profit from BTC forecasted price appreciation through 2024 and beyond. Finally, compared to solely holding BTC, HUT offers a preferable risk-adjusted opportunity in my view. Its diversified business model provides ongoing revenue and upside even if BTC does not move as expected post-halving or regulatory clarity is delayed. Furthermore, as per the comparison below, HUT remains comparatively undervalued versus peers that have appreciated substantially since 22 Oct 2023 (when BTC prices goes above 30k) as one of the premier miners yet to fully participate in the crypto sector's recent momentum. Yahoo Finance For prudent investors seeking leverage while balancing risks, HUT presents advantages over investing on BTC in isolation.

Among the cryptocurrency entities C1 has reached out to are gaming and metaverse-focused venture capital firm Animoca Brands and Chainalysis, the blockchain analysis entity. C1 has offered to buy private holdings from investors at between 50% and 80% discount on their last valuation, according to the report.  Australia has taken a cautious approach to the larger crypto industry ever since the collapse of FTX. Its government has proposed a regime that could take until 2025 for an Australian digital asset platform to receive a licence, updated its tax guidelines to impose capital gains tax on wrapped tokens too, and declared that it won’t be introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for some years. But with the crypto market gaining momentum, sentiment may be changing down under.  The report attributed the information to a pitch deck outlining C1’s strategy – seek out entities with a “minimum valuation of $300 million in their last funding round, preferably Series C and later.” The report said C1 wants to write cheques between $20 million and $50 million.  “Due to current market conditions in the public and private markets, hyperinflation and rising interest rates, we believe the digital assets market offers very attractive valuations in the secondary market,” the deck reads, according to the report.  “C1 did not authorize this article, and we have not met with either company directly as of this time,” said Dr. Najam Kidwai, co-founder and managing partner of C1.  Animoca and Chainalysis did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

The 4% drop to $42,000 has cooled the overheated crypto perpetual futures market, clearing the way for a steady ascent into the year-end.  Perpetuals are futures with no expiry with a funding rate mechanism that helps tether perpetual prices to the index price. Funding rates are periodic payments of an asset between long (buy) and short (sell) position holders calculated and collected by exchanges every eight hours. A positive funding rate means the perpetual contract is trading at a premium to the spot prices; longs are dominant and are paying shorts to keep their positions open. A negative rate suggests otherwise.  A high funding rate, typically greater than 0.10% (for eight hours), is taken to represent excess bullish leverage or overcrowding of long positions.  According to data source Velo Data, funding rates for BTC, ETH and other major cryptocurrencies consistently tapped the 0.15% mark in the second half of last week, signifying an overheated leveraged market.  The situation has normalized with the early Asian session market-wide price drop, leaving funding rates for most coins in a healthy territory below 0.1%.  It's a sign overleveraged traders have been shaken out of the market. Funding rates or costs associated with leverage become a burden when the momentum stalls, forcing overleveraged traders to exit and causing a minor bullish/bearish hiccup.  The market-wide decline in the notional open interest, or the dollar value locked in open crypto futures contracts, suggests the same.

There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $65.00 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).

Bitcoin was down as low as 5% over a 24-hour period, trading at $41,300, before recovering to $42,000, according to CoinDesk Indices data. Ether hit a low of $2,170 before climbing back up to $2,239. Solana was down to $66 before climbing back to $70. Most of these losses took place within the last 90 minutes, as of press time.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is down 4% to 1,743.  “The broader market has seen a minor adjustment at the start of this week due to the better-than-expected nonfarm payroll and lower unemployment,"" Greta Yuan, Head of Research, at VDX, a Hong Kong digital assets platform, told CoinDesk in an email interview. ""The stronger labor market slightly diminished the hope of the Fed lowering the rate early next year. Gold price also dropped with the US dollar index rallied.”  Coinglass data shows that there had been over $335 million in liquidations over the last 12 hours, with $300 million in long positions being liquidated.  Bitcoin and ether lead the way in the liquidation heatmap, with over $89 million in bitcoin positions getting liquidated and $74 million in ether.  “The recent minor correction in the broader market is part of the rational process of profit-taking as traders might have hit the price target at the end of the year given BTC rallied over 70% since Oct,"" Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst, at Metalpha said in an interview on WeChat.  ""We will closely follow the CPI and U.S. Fed meeting this week, which could potentially result in further corrections,” she added.  On-chain analyst Willy Woo wrote on X that the market may see a correction in bitcoin prices down to $39,700.  The Bitcoin CME Gap at 39,700 refers to a situation where bitcoin's price on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange jumped, leaving a gap at $39,700, and historically, such gaps usually get filled, meaning the price often returns to this level. Price gaps in the CME futures market for bitcoin occur due to its hours of operation being aligned with U.S. trading hours, leading to potential price differences at market open and close.
