Cyril-DeFi forecasted returns ranging from 50x to 100x for those willing to venture into the altcoin market during this period. The premise of such an optimistic outlook is rooted in the historical performance of altcoins during these seasons, where the broader market sees a significant upswing in value outside the dominion of Bitcoin. Cyril‚Äôs analysis suggests that an investment of $10,000 could become a million dollars by 2025, assuming the investor navigates the altcoin market with the right narratives. Related Reading: Altcoins Fall: Will Ethereum And Solana Bulls Surpass Expectations? Emerging Narratives And Altcoin Picks Notably, Cyril-DeFi‚Äôs projections are not without basis. He earmarks several key narratives that he believes will dominate the next alt season, pinpointing areas within the cryptocurrency sector that are ripe for growth. Among these, Artificial Intelligence (AI) stands out, spurred by the widespread adoption of AI applications like ChatGPT. Cyril posits that blockchains offering solutions to AI-related challenges, including storage, data accessibility, and computational power, will likely grow substantially. Furthermore, Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePin) are highlighted as another potential area, with incentives for users contributing to GPS maps, space weather tracking, and environmental monitoring poised to offer lucrative rewards. The upcoming alt season promises 50x-100x returns. By 2025, $10k of assets could soar to $500k-$1M. To seize this opportunity, you need to follow the right narratives Here are 5 key narratives and altcoin picks to watch üëÄüßµ pic.twitter.com/y7jpqGe4Qn ‚Äî Cyril ‚Äì DeFi (@cyrilXBT) March 31, 2024 Beyond the technical and infrastructural narratives, Cyril spotlighted memecoins, Real World Assets (RWA), and Game Finance (GameFi) as pivotal to the altcoin surge. According to Cyril, while memecoins present a high-risk, high-reward scenario, often driven by viral trends rather than foundational technology, their allure lies in the potential for notable gains. Conversely, Cyril highlighted that RWAs introduce a tangible aspect to the digital currency realm, with tokenization efforts to bridge real estate and business investments with the blockchain world. Lastly, GameFi‚Äôs integration of gaming with blockchain technology, rewarding players in cryptocurrency, is expected to continue attracting interest and investment, signaling strong performance during the alt season, according to the analyst. Related Reading: Altcoins Shows Buy Signals, Massive Opportunity Beckons: Analyst Market Insights And Predictions It is worth noting that this optimistic outlook towards altcoins is not singular to Cyril-DeFi. Other analysts, like Xremlinalso, concur that the upcoming alt season could surpass the substantial gains observed in 2021. Supporting this perspective, analytics firm Santiment reveals several altcoins currently residing in what they term the ‚ÄúOpportunity Zone.‚Äù This classification is based on the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) metric, indicating that despite recent market downturns, certain altcoins present promising mid-term investment opportunities. Santiment‚Äôs analysis provides a nuanced view of the market. It suggests that altcoins with subdued performance relative to their counterparts may offer a fertile ground for investors aiming to capitalize on the impending alt season. üìä Following #Bitcoin‚Äòs drop to a 2-week low of $61.7K Tuesday, the @santimentfeed MVRV Opportunity & Danger Zone Model indicates that several #altcoins have finally dropped enough for mid-term trading returns to be in an #opportunity zone.

25097893,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600823,1712008832,"Telegram Implements Toncoin Payment Integration For Ads, TON Price Sees Impact","Telegram, the renowned messaging platform, recently unveiled a new feature that allows users to promote their channels through advertising. With the launch of this feature, users can now purchase ad space using Toncoins (TON), the native cryptocurrency powered by the TON blockchain. Telegram Implements TON Blockchain For Ad Payments Acknowledging the potential for channel owners to generate advertising revenue, Telegram‚Äôs announcement highlighted that channels collectively accumulate over 1 trillion views each month. Realizing this opportunity, Telegram has implemented a revenue-sharing model, enabling channel owners with a minimum of 1000 subscribers to receive 50% of the ad revenue generated from ads displayed on their channels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flash Crash Washes Out 81,000 Crypto Traders For Over $220 Million The decision to integrate the TON blockchain into this feature was driven by various reasons, as noted in the social media platform‚Äôs announcement on Sunday: We chose the TON Blockchain because it has low fees, high transaction speeds ‚Äì and holds a record for the number of transactions it can process per second. Anyone can now promote their bot or channel ‚Äì with budgets as low as a handful of Toncoins. When creating a Telegram ad, you choose the exact channels where you‚Äôd like it to appear, so you have full control over their context. Telegram CEO Pavel Durov had previously emphasized the importance of fast and secure ad payments and withdrawals, expressing that the TON blockchain would be the exclusive platform for these transactions. Durov stated: To ensure ad payments and withdrawals are fast and secure, we will exclusively use the TON blockchain. Similar to our approach with Telegram usernames on Fragment, we will sell ads and share revenue with channel owners in Toncoin. This will create a virtuous circle, in which content creators will be able to either cash out their Toncoins ‚Äî or reinvest them in promoting and upgrading their channels. TON Shows Bullish Momentum As Telegram unveils these new features and developments that can significantly boost the adoption and usage of the TON token, the cryptocurrency has responded positively. Over the past 24 hours, TON has surged by more than 5%, reaching a current trading price of $5.30. This surge adds to its impressive 100% price increase over the past 30 days alone. Notably, the announcement has also caused a substantial increase in the trading volume of TON, which has soared to $234,869,370 in the past 24 hours. This represents a rise of over 74% compared to Sunday‚Äôs trading volume, according to CoinGecko data. Related Reading: Traders Not Showing Dogecoin FOMO, Good Sign For Rally? Furthermore, the TON token is approaching its all-time high (ATH) mark of $5.69, reached on March 25. With the introduction of these new features in Telegram and the notable increase in trading volume, the token appears to be on the verge of setting a new ATH in the coming days if the demand continues to rise. However, the token must surpass the significant resistance level of $5.45 for this scenario to unfold. This price level has proven to be a hurdle for the token, as it has attempted three times to break through and consolidate above it to reach a new ATH but has failed. Overcoming this resistance level is crucial before the token can approach new ATH levels. On the TON/USD 4-hour chart, the support level that could potentially halt a price correction following the recent uptrend is $5.26. This support level acts as a buffer to prevent a significant downward correction in price.

25096214,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600761,1712005212,"Bitcoin Halving Inches Closer With Less Than 2,900 Blocks Left","The Bitcoin Halving is fast approaching, with less than 2,900 blocks left before miners‚Äô rewards are cut in half. This event, projected to take place sometime in April, is significant as Bitcoin‚Äôs price could enjoy a parabolic move to the upside after it takes place. Bitcoin Halving Set For April 19 Data from Coinwarz shows that the Bitcoin Halving is set to take place on April 19 at Block 840,000. This projection is based on Bitcoin‚Äôs current block time average, which means the Halving can come a little earlier or sometime after April 19. However, the main focus remains that miners‚Äô supply will be cut in half. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks New 3-Year High ‚Äì Here Are Factors That Could Drive The Price To $1 The Halving event is a deflationary measure that Bitcoin‚Äôs founder, Satoshi Nakamoto, encoded in the flagship crypto and takes place after every 210,000 blocks. Three halving events have occurred since the Genesis block in 2009, when Bitcoin‚Äôs first block was mined. The first was on November 28, 2012, when miners‚Äô rewards were cut from 50 BTC to 25 BTC. The next Halving event took place on July 9, 2016, cutting miners‚Äô rewards to 12.5 BTC. The third one happened on May 11, 2020, reducing the reward to 6.25 BTC. Now, Miners‚Äô rewards are set to be cut in half again, reducing them to 3.125 BTC. This reward is the amount of BTC miners receive for validating each block of new transactions on the blockchain. Although this event mainly affects miners, the crypto community closely monitors it due to the ripple effects it could have on the market. Bitcoin‚Äôs supply comes through these miners‚Äô rewards, and a reduction in them usually drives Bitcoin‚Äôs value higher. Bitcoin‚Äôs Performance After Each Halving The Halving has historically always led to a price appreciation for Bitcoin. Ninety days after the first Halving on November 28, 2012, Bitcoin‚Äôs price increased to $1,000 from $12 at the time of Halving. Subsequently, Bitcoin‚Äôs price saw a gain of over 8,000% one year after that Halving. Source: MilkRoad This parabolic price surge also occurred after the second and third Halving events, with Bitcoin‚Äôs price rising from $650 and $8,821 (at the time of the Halving) to $2,506 and $56,612 (90 days after the Halving) in 2016 and 2020 respectively. Bitcoin also gained 284% and 559% one year after the event. Related Reading: Panel Of Experts Reveal When The Cardano Price Will Reach $3 This time isn‚Äôt expected to be different as Bitcoin is again predicted to experience a massive move to the upside after April. This bullish sentiment is further strengthened by Bitcoin‚Äôs demand, which has continued to skyrocket in the face of a dwindling supply. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $70,400, up in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Bitcoin Taker Buy Sell Ratio May Reveal Selling Opportunities In a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, an analyst discussed the trend in the Bitcoin ‚Äútaker buy sell ratio.‚Äù This indicator keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin taker buy and taker sell volumes. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, the investors are willing to purchase coins at a higher price right now. Such a trend implies a bullish sentiment is the dominant force in the market. Related Reading: Traders Not Showing Dogecoin FOMO, Good Sign For Rally? On the other hand, the indicator being under the mark suggests the selling pressure may be higher than the current buying pressure in the sector. As such, the majority may share a bearish mentality. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day moving average (MA) Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio over the last few years: The 30-day MA value of the metric appears to have been going down in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph shows, the 30-day MA Bitcoin taker buy-sell ratio has recently fallen below the 1 level. The quant has highlighted in the chart the region of the metric where the bull run peaks in 2021 formed. The indicator would appear to dip below 0.97 during both the heights registered in that bull run. According to the analyst, such indicator values suggest the euphoria phase of the market where the smart money starts to sell. Still, the prices continue to hold on as the retail investors continue to FOMO into the asset. So far, the indicator has approached the 0.98 level in its latest decline, implying that it‚Äôs not yet at the levels where the possibility of a top might become significant if the pattern of the previous bull run is anything to go by. The Bitcoin taker buy sell ratio may also be used as a buying signal, with the 1.02 level being an important level. The quant notes, however, that the metric is better at showing an overbought market than it is for pinpointing oversold conditions.

However, crypto analyst Jason Pizzino recently made a strong case for altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) and why much focus should also be placed on them. Ethereum And Solana Still Primed For Strong Moves Ahead Of Bitcoin Pizzino suggested in a video on his YouTube channel that Ethereum could experience a breakout in the coming months. This came following his analysis of the ETH/BTC pair, in which he noted that Bitcoin was currently taking the spotlight with new all-time highs (ATH) while ETH looks to be consolidating. Related Reading: Panel Of Experts Reveal When The Cardano Price Will Reach $3 As highlighted by the analyst, this is similar to the previous bull run when ETH consolidated while Bitcoin was hitting new ATHs. However, ETH experienced a significant rise soon after then while Bitcoin cooled off. As such, if history were to repeat itself, ETH could once again enjoy a trend reversal soon enough and make a parabolic move to the upside. Pizzino also mentioned SOL as another altcoin that can potentially move to new prices against Bitcoin‚Äôs value. In the last bull run, the crypto token also experienced significant moves to the downside as Bitcoin hit new ATHs. However, a trend reversal quickly followed afterward, with SOL enjoying moves to the upside. Therefore, SOL, like ETH, could be primed for price surges if history were to repeat. Pizzino added that this is a time to be aware and see any price dip as a buying opportunity to position for these price gains that could be on the horizon. Ethereum Showing Some Strength Crypto analyst Micha√´l van de Poppe echoed Pizzino‚Äôs sentiments in a post on his X (formerly Twitter) platform. While analyzing the ETH/BTC pair, he noted that ETH‚Äôs price hasn‚Äôt made any significant move against Bitcoin‚Äôs as of yet. However, he added that it is a ‚Äúgood sign to see some slight strength in Ethereum.‚Äù Related Reading: Prepping For $100,000: Bitcoin Shark And Whales Spend Over $18 Billion To Buy BTC Like Pizzino, van de Poppe also expects Ethereum to make a massive move against Bitcoin‚Äôs value soon enough. The crypto expert explicitly stated that he still expects ‚Äúa lot‚Äù from the second-largest crypto token by market cap. Besides Ethereum, van de Poppe has continued making a case for other altcoins as he believes they are still undervalued. In another X post, he highlighted that altcoins are down between 25% and 40% from their recent highs. However, van de Poppe remarked that this is the perfect time to take positions and that these consolidations should be seen as opportunities rather than a drawbacks.

42418545,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThXrB,1711993138,Bitcoin‚Äôs Future as Currency,"Bitcoin is a global, decentralized currency that is beyond the control or guarantee of any country. Recent months in the Bitcoin ecosystem have been marked by a fever pitch of optimism based on the approval of Bitcoin spot market exchange-traded funds. These ETFs are driving Bitcoin‚Äôs adoption into the mainstream through the retirement accounts of millions as well as the portfolio constructions of thousands of financial advisors and institutional investors.  The ETFs miss the point, though. Bitcoin is not an asset to hold; it is a currency to use. Bitcoin doesn‚Äôt have a price, it has an exchange rate. The future of bitcoin is not that of an asset sitting in an ETF or buried in one‚Äôs backyard in a hardware wallet. Currencies are meant to transact.  Zac Townsend is the CEO and co-founder of bitcoin-denominated insurance company Meanwhile. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuture of Bitcoin‚Äù package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin ‚Äúhalving‚Äù in April 2024.  Though day-to-day payments, like buying coffee, are not a great use for bitcoin, the future is one where there is robust economic activity denominated in bitcoin. Bitcoin will shine at storing value, settling large payments, conducting financial services, and more.  At least 57 countries in the world had inflation rates over 10% last year. The United Kingdom‚Äôs was more than 9%, and the United States‚Äô was over 8%. For residents of countries with a history of inflation, regime, or currency risk, the day-to-day volatility of the exchange rate of bitcoin to fiat may seem a lower danger than the decade-to-decade fiscal and monetary mismanagement of countries all over the world.  For this future to exist, though, companies and institutions have to be built within the Bitcoin economy. Meanwhile has built one of the first: a fully-fledged, regulated life insurance company denominated in bitcoin. We conduct all our business in bitcoin. We are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary Authority, which lets us operate on a modified accounting basis with bitcoin as the unit of currency.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - 12 Future Bitcoin Scenarios: From Bullish to Bearish  We operate a life insurance company like any other. But instead of being in a currency with depreciating purchasing power ‚Äî like dollars, euros, yen, Swiss francs, or pound sterling ‚Äî our currency is bitcoin, which is appreciating as a store-of-value.  That means that our company truly operates on the Bitcoin Standard. We state our balance sheet and income statement entirely in bitcoin. Our policyholders pay their premiums in bitcoin, and we make guarantees and promises in bitcoin ‚Äì agreeing to pay all claims out to beneficiaries entirely in bitcoin. We do our solvency calculations and make all our regulatory filings in terms of bitcoin. We keep our insurance reserves denominated in bitcoin. We state policy values and do all our actuarial math in bitcoin.  This approach means that, as the saying goes, one bitcoin equals one bitcoin. Our policyholders can sleep safe knowing that exchange rate fluctuations do not affect our business, and we can operate knowing that we can meet our promises for the same reason. Bitcoin‚Äôs exchange rate has fluctuated between $15,500 and $70,000 over the course of operating the company, but our balance sheet keeps growing in bitcoin terms with no volatility.  We are just one of the first companies to operate in this way, but we should not be the last. Entrepreneurs, builders, bitcoin (and crypto) natives, and, honestly, much of the world‚Äôs population will increasingly see the value of building their businesses and their lives on the Bitcoin Standard. Like us, that means they can stop worrying about the exchange rate of bitcoin to the dollar today, or tomorrow, or next month, or even this year and start thinking about bitcoin as a store-of-value that will clearly be worth more in the decades to come.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING,Zac Townsend ,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/04/01/bitcoins-future-as-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d047b895381969f6818c4060d8cfbb41c2ebf7b7-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company has expanded their Sandersville facility and energized the first 100MW of its expansion plan, increasing their hash rate to 14EH/s. Total firm rate now stands at 16EH/s. CleanSpark has an estimated breakeven cost-to-mine rate of $28,093 post-halving, suggesting profitability may continue with the assumption that the price of bitcoin remains at current levels. CleanSpark, Inc. ( CLSK ) is taking on the Bitcoin halving event by storm by actively increasing their production rates through the construction and expansion of new facilities. CleanSpark has the growth initiative to reach 20EH/s (exahashes per second) during e1h24 with the long-term goal of 50EH/s in 2025 and is making strides to reach these targets. With an estimated breakeven cost-to-mine of $28,093/btc post-halving, I believe that the firm is positioned to effectively operate in the current market given Bitcoin's elevated price of $70,800/btc as of 3/31/24. I provide CLSK a BUY recommendation with a price target of $42.32 at 19.92x eFY25 EV/aEBITDA. Operations CleanSpark recently expanded their Sandersville facility and energized the first 100MW of its expansion plan, increasing their hash rate to 14EH/s. This is up from their previously reported deployed hash rate of 12.5EH/s on their q1'24 earnings release. CleanSpark has also commenced operations at their three Mississippi facilities, which are expected to add an additional 2.4EH/s once the S21s are fully deployed. As reported in their March 1, 2024 press release , CleanSpark's production has exceeded 16EH/s with over 131,000 operating miners deployed. With the 60% increase in production, CleanSpark mined nearly 650BTC for the month of February 2024, most of which was added to their treasury. At the time of the press release, this figure equated to $260mm in added reserves. CleanSpark acquired the three facilities for a cash payment of $19.8mm and anticipates reaching full capacity by April 2024. Corporate Reports Management expects that the firm can perform at 32EH/s at full deployment of 215,000 miners. Though I believe this to be a longer-term strategy given their present growth rate, this may come to fruition over the course of the next few years post-BTC halving. My thought process behind this is that less efficient mining facilities will be faced with significant headwinds post-halving and may be faced with selling assets or closing shops. This can be beneficial to CleanSpark as the firm currently has $48.5mm in cash & equiv. on the balance sheet, not inclusive of digital assets. If considering their Bitcoin holdings, as of 3/31/24, their balance is closer to $299mm. Corporate Reports Given the pace of growth CleanSpark has engaged in going into the halving event, I believe management has been opportunistic in their mining operations in preparation for the more challenging operating environment. I believe this strategy will somewhat pay off for CleanSpark as the halving event will significantly reduce the reward for mining efforts once enacted. Management mentioned on their q1'24 earnings call that the halving event won't necessarily be a -50% cut to operations, but closer to a -15-30% drop in the overall hash rate. Management does believe that the halving event will be a positive catalyst to Bitcoin pricing going forward; however, historical pricing suggests a lagging effect prior to any upside in pricing. TradingView As I had discussed in my report covering Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ), I believe there will be a shift in how shareholders view Bitcoin mining firms as Bitcoin ETFs become available at the start of 2024. There are two sides to the coin. The first is that there is somewhat of a floor in demand for Bitcoin as the ETFs must hold a certain number of Bitcoins to satisfy the trust. Investors certainly have taken notice of the ETFs as the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin ETF has accumulated $6.43b in assets as of 2/29/2024. Forbes published a list of some of the top Bitcoin ETFs on the market, spanning from $303mm in AUM to Grayscale's Bitcoin trust at $20.9b. Forbes Overall, I believe that investors' interest in the ETFs will help create price stability for Bitcoin over time. In the near-to-midterm, I expect that the growing interest by investors will create strong tailwinds for Bitcoin pricing up until a point of dilution that major price swings won't be as prevalent. This should be a positive catalyst for CleanSpark as the stronger price per coin will contribute to the miner's growth and longer-term, price stability will make cash flows less uncertain. On the flip side, Bitcoin ETFs have created a vehicle for investors to directly invest in Bitcoin without having to use alternative vehicles, such as Bitcoin miners, as a proxy. What I mean by this is that investors no longer have to bear the operational risk as a shareholder in order to invest in Bitcoin exposure. I believe that this changes the dynamics for investing in Bitcoin mining companies as investors can satisfy their exposure more directly. What I expect is that companies like CleanSpark will likely be valued on generating cash flow going forward as opposed to their Bitcoin holdings. Though holding Bitcoin has the ability to create tremendous value for the firm, I believe that given this paradigm shift, the firm must operationally perform for value and not just growth. As CleanSpark nears the Bitcoin halving event, management has taken tremendous steps in cleaning up their operations. This has resulted in a -24% reduction in professional services fees and a -35% reduction in G&A. These operational improvements have clearly shown in the company's reported earnings as the firm cleared $69mm in aEBITDA at a 94% margin. It is debatable as to whether eliminating D&A is reasonable for valuing CleanSpark as this line item accounts for 66% of total costs to operate in their q1'24 earnings report. Given that running their mining machines at full capacity is the growth driver for the business, D&A is essentially a core cost of doing business, despite being a non-cash expense. Corporate Reports Forecasting operations, I do anticipate the firm to realize substantial growth through their expanded mining operations. Assuming Bitcoin remains in the current range, I believe that CleanSpark can reach $418mm in revenue for eFY24 and $611mm for eFY25. I believe that management rushing to get sites online before the halving event was a strong move as it allows the firm to be advantageous in optimizing the reward before it is reduced post-halving. Management anticipates that the firm's cost-to-mine after the halving event will be $28,093 given their current fleet. This compares to $47,117 for the industry average. I believe that this low breakeven cost can create significant tailwinds for CleanSpark with the assumption that interest in Bitcoin continues to grow. As alluded to earlier in this report, I believe that the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs has created somewhat of a floor for demand for Bitcoin holdings, allowing miners to realize higher prices. This is a phenomenon that is currently being seen in uranium mining along with the Sprott Uranium Spot ETF (U.U). In terms of power costs, I do believe management made the right decision to acquire power for the new facilities under a fixed price agreement. I believe that with the increased power demands for Bitcoin mining paired with the increasing rate of growth in the data center space, the increased power consumption for computing capacity will potentially drive up electricity costs. CleanSpark has already faced challenges with sourcing electricity in the recent quarter as the firm faced headwinds in sourcing adequate power due to their utility substation transformer not passing its most recent inspection. I believe this will not be an isolated event going forward as much of the grid requires significant upgrading as more compute capacity comes online for AI and as electric vehicle popularity grows. Corporate Reports Considering multiple scenarios, the blue sky assumes Bitcoin averages 20% above the current price and the gray sky assumes Bitcoin's price declines by ~45% from its current levels, holding all else equal. This base case scenario has a lot of unknown factors that I cannot control for, including utilization rate, the firm's ability to source power to run machines at full capacity, and their ability to source machines and get them racked and running on time, amongst other factors. I believe that these scenarios laid out provide a reasonable baseline expectation based on the price of Bitcoin and the firm's operating efficiencies. Valuation & Shareholder Value Corporate Reports I believe valuing CLSK going forward will be based on the firm's operational efficiencies over the book value of their Bitcoin holdings given the argument above as it pertains to Bitcoin spot ETFs. Given the firm's growth trajectory and the perceived value of Bitcoin, I believe that CLSK holds a significant amount of upside potential as the firm expands their operations while managing their operational leverage. I believe management has laid out an appealing growth strategy that can effectively mine Bitcoin at a profit going forward, assuming the price of Bitcoin remains relatively elevated. I provide CLSK shares a BUY recommendation with a price target of $42.32/share at 19.92x my target eFY25 EV/aEBITDA forecast. I believe this price target poses a good midpoint given the volatility in spot Bitcoin prices and provides a roadmap for the firm's growth in hash rates.

Dogecoin Total Amount Of Holders Has Remained Flat Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, FOMO, which would normally be associated with tops, has been absent from the Dogecoin market recently. The indicator of relevance here is the ‚ÄúTotal Amount of Holders,‚Äù which, as its name suggests, keeps track of the total number of DOGE addresses that are carrying a non-zero balance right now. Related Reading: What‚Äôs A Simple Strategy For Buying & Selling Bitcoin? This Analyst Answers When the value of this metric goes up, it can be because of a number of reasons. A major one would naturally be fresh adoption, as new investors coming into the sector would open up new addresses and add balance to them, thus raising the indicator‚Äôs value. Other reasons can include existing users reconsolidating their holdings among multiple addresses (usually for a purpose like privacy) or old investors coming back to reinvest in the meme coin. In general, whenever the metric shows this kind of trend, it means that some net adoption of the asset is taking place, which can be a positive sign in the long term. On the other hand, a decline in the indicator implies some holders may have decided to exit from the cryptocurrency as they have completely cleared out their addresses. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Total Amount of Holders over the last few months: The value of the metric appears to have been moving sideways for a while now | Source: Santiment on X As displayed in the above graph, the ‚ÄòTotal Amount of Holders‚Äô for Dogecoin has been flat for many weeks now, implying that the adoption of the meme coin has hit the brakes. Interestingly, this sideways trajectory has come despite the fact that DOGE‚Äôs price has gone through some volatile price action during this period. Generally, events like rallies are attractive to traders, so a notable amount of them tend to jump into the asset during them. It would appear that the traders have either not been paying attention to the recent DOGE rally or just not taking it seriously. In the past couple of weeks, the ‚ÄòTotal Amount of Holders‚Äô for the meme coin has gone up by only 0.21%, despite the fact that the price has rallied more than 40% in the same window. Historically, when a large number of traders join the blockchain at once during price surges, it‚Äôs a sign that FOMO around the asset is spreading. Usually, the meme coin‚Äôs price tends to go against the expectations of the majority, so when there is widespread FOMO, a top can become likely to take place. Related Reading: Coinbase Sees Largest USDC Inflow Ever, What This Could Mean For Bitcoin As there hasn‚Äôt been any such FOMO for Dogecoin recently, it‚Äôs possible that it could be a positive sign for the rally‚Äôs continuation. There is also another signal brewing, however, that may not be so constructive. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that the Mean Dollar Invested Age, a metric that keeps track of the average age of DOGE investments, has plunged recently, implying that the experienced hands have been on the move. When this signal formed earlier in the year, the coin‚Äôs price approached the top not too long after.

Bitcoin‚Äôs Network Activity, Adoption, and Fees Daily transactions: In contrast to the market's upward trajectory, Bitcoin's daily transactions declined by 4%. Ordinal inscriptions: Daily inscriptions dropped by 27%, reflecting reduced activity in this specific area of the Bitcoin network. Total transfer volume: $69.34 billion in value was transferred across the Bitcoin network daily, an explosive increase of 74%, elevating this activity into the 90th percentile of historical performance. Average transaction fees: The average user paid $7.68 in fees to send a Bitcoin transaction in March, an increase of 25% of m/m, reflecting the growing cost of network participation amid surging demand, a fee level that ranks within the 93rd percentile historically. Bitcoin Market Health and Profitability Percent of addresses in profit : 98% of Bitcoin addresses are now in profit, suggesting nearly universal profitability for Bitcoin holders in the current market climate. Historically, once this number reaches 100%, the Bitcoin price tends to make repeated all-time highs. Net unrealized profit/loss: This ratio climbed to 0.61, indicating a growing optimism within the market, but not yet at the ‚Äúeuphoric‚Äù levels above 0.75 that mark previous peaks. Bitcoin Miners Total daily BTC miner revenues : Miners enjoyed a significant 35% boost in average daily revenues in March, reaching $62.84 million, a figure that places their earnings in the 99th percentile for historical miner revenue. We have been expecting Bitcoin miners to reverse their recent underperformance YTD, which is beginning to occur. Chart of the Month: Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Miners Source: Bloomberg, as of 3/25/24.

Moreover, the extent to which Web3 companies or digital assets utilize blockchain technology may vary, and it is possible that even widespread adoption of blockchain technology may not result in a material increase in the value of such companies or digital assets. Digital asset prices are highly volatile, and the value of digital assets, and Web3 companies, can rise or fall dramatically and quickly.

There has since been some recovery in the price of the largest cryptocurrency in the space. However, the damage has already been done as tens of thousands of crypto traders were flushed out of their leveraged positions as a result. 81,000 Crypto Traders Lose $220 Million The Bitcoin flash crash hit support just above $68,800 but crypto traders are already feeling the brunt of the large move. In the last day, more than 81,000 traders have lost their leveraged positions and the volume of their liquidations have piled up. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Dips Below $0.00003 Again ‚Äì Can Bulls Reverse The Bullish Momentum? According to data from Coinglass, the numbers have climbed above 81,400 crypto traders who were liquidated as a result of the crash. In total, over $223 million was also lost during this time from all of the flushed positions. Then, the single largest liquidation took place on the OKX exchange across the ETH-USD-SWAP pair. This trader alone lost $7 million when their position was liquidated. As expected, the majority of the losses have come from long traders, with Coinglass showing a total of 70.01% of the liquidated positions being longs. This means that long liquidation volumes climbed above $156 million during the last 24 hours. The crypto exchange with the largest liquidation volumes was the OKX exchange, accounting for 46.87%, or $104.61 million, of all liquidations. Binance came in second place with 38.72%, or $86.41 million. Meanwhile, Bybit saw the third-largest liquidation volume at 8.4%, or $18.75 million. Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Dogecoin Lead Liquidations Naturally, the crypto assets with the largest liquidation volumes have been Bitcoin and Ethereum, with $36.1 million and $28.98 million. However, meme coins such as Dogecoin and PEPE have seen their own numbers ramp up as well. Dogecoin‚Äôs liquidation volumes came out at $10.4 million for the 24-hour period, which put it ahead of Solana with $8.3 million. Then coming up behind Solana is PEPE, with liquidation volumes climbing as high as $7.1 million.

42418532,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThXcj,1711983265,12 Future Bitcoin Scenarios: From Bullish to Bearish,"Just over three years ago, at the start of the last bull cycle, I spoke with experts in the space to write ‚ÄúThe Future of Bitcoin: 12 Scenarios From Bullish to Bearish.‚Äù  Much has changed since then. The price of bitcoin was around $25,000 when I began my reporting, which then seemed astronomically high. No one had heard of SBF, Bitcoin Ordinals or ChatGPT. No one owned a Bitcoin ETF.  So as Bitcoin enters its fourth halving this April, it‚Äôs time to refresh and revamp these scenarios, once again ranging from bullish to bearish. And once again we vaguely defined the ‚Äúfuture‚Äù as ten years from now ‚Äì far enough so there‚Äôs room for play and close enough so there‚Äôs a link to reality.  This feature is part of CoinDesk‚Äôs ‚ÄúFuture of Bitcoin‚Äù package published to coincide with the fourth Bitcoin ‚Äúhalving‚Äù in April 2024.  There‚Äôs one thing that hasn‚Äôt changed in our methodology: A humble acknowledgement that we‚Äôre all flying blind, and no one really knows what will happen with bitcoin. That‚Äôs part of the appeal. ‚ÄúMost of the biggest use cases 10 years from now will be things that would sound insane to us today,‚Äù Elizabeth Stark told me in 2021. ‚ÄúKind of like how an encyclopedia that anyone can edit would have sounded crazy to people in the pre-Wikipedia era.‚Äù  Welcome to the future(s) of bitcoin, ranging from regulatory hell to telepathic DeFi.  1. Bitcoin to ‚Äúbuy a cup of coffee‚Äù  Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, imagines that in 10 years bitcoin can finally, truly, be used in a mainstream way to pay for things like coffee and beer and donuts. ‚ÄúBy 2035, you‚Äôll be able to buy most goods and services around the world in sats,‚Äù predicts Klippsten.  This doesn‚Äôt mean he thinks bitcoin will fully replace the dollar. He envisions that most goods will have ‚Äútwo price tags‚Äù ‚Äî one in fiat, one in bitcoin. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt have replaced all fiat currency,‚Äù says Klippsten. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to live in a multi-currency world, as we always have.‚Äù  2. Bitcoin-Powered Games  There are over 3 billion gamers on the planet. Des Dickerson, CEO of THNDR Games, envisions a future where these billions of gamers are getting rewarded in bitcoin, thanks to the speed of the Lightning Network. ‚ÄúBitcoin should be the native currency of the internet,‚Äù says Dickerson. ‚ÄúSo it goes without saying that bitcoin should inherently exist in games.‚Äù  This is all, of course, still very much just theoretical. THNDR already has 1.5 million users, says Dickerson, but acknowledges that ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt see massive adoption until there‚Äôs a viral game that has bitcoin in it.‚Äù  3. TradFi Tames Bitcoin  In the very first line of his white paper, Satoshi Nakamoto describes bitcoin as peer-to-peer electronic cash that would ‚Äúallow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.‚Äù  These words have been discussed and parsed for over 15 years. For many in the space, they‚Äôre more iconic and inspirational than ‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident.‚Äù And the key clause, for many, is ‚Äúwithout going through a financial institution.‚Äù  Which is why bitcoin‚Äôs biggest story of 2024 ‚Äî the emergence of ETFs ‚Äî is something of an awkward dynamic. Isaiah Jackson, author of ‚ÄúBitcoin and Black America,‚Äù sees the ETFs as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, yes, the ETFs have unleashed a pipeline of new capital, which Jackson believes will ‚Äúpump the price sky high.‚Äù (So far the charts agree.) But then again, the ETF-injected capital gives more power to the Blackrocks and Fidelities of the world. ‚ÄúIf you have enough bitcoin you can buy lobbyists,‚Äù says Jackson. ‚ÄúAnd you can convince them [politicians] of things like, ‚ÄòHey, we need to control bitcoin mining.‚Äô‚Äù  The concern is shared by Wendy O, host of The O Show (and former CoinDesker). She acknowledges the very real benefits of ‚Äúethically grifting‚Äù on the tailwinds of bitcoin‚Äôs ETF-driven price surge, but also envisions a scenario where ‚ÄúTradFi steps in and governs bitcoin for us.‚Äù  4. ABI: Artificial Bitcoin Intelligence  As AI continues to advance, we‚Äôll soon see the rise of ‚Äúsmart agents‚Äù that can do things like book our flights, pay our bills and order us Thai food.  ‚ÄúNo one is giving AIs a bank account, but bitcoin is perfect as a natively-digital means for AI to transact,‚Äù says David Johnston, lead contributor to the Morpheus project, which is building a decentralized platform for AI agents to transact and spend crypto. (Morpheus is technically ‚Äúchain agnostic,‚Äù but the potential for bitcoin seems clear.)  The role of bitcoin and AI doesn‚Äôt stop at spending sats. ‚ÄúIf you have a smart agent that can send transactions or access DeFi, you have a whole new set of tools accessible to you,‚Äù says Johnston. Just as ChatGPT made it easier for non-coders to program using plain English, in the future, says Johnston, you can easily use advanced DeFi tools without any technical knowledge, and without using a bank.  Johnston gives a quick example. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs say I wanted to earn native bitcoin yield, with no wrapping, no bridges, and no third parties.‚Äù This is tough for a layperson. (Not that a layperson would ever say the words ‚Äúnative bitcoin yield,‚Äù but you get the picture.) With AI-empowered bitcoin, says Johnston, you could just say something like, ‚ÄúI want my bitcoin to earn some yield in a safe and decentralized manner,‚Äù and it would do the research to find solid, reputable, non-custodial solutions, and ‚Äúnot some crap that a YouTube influence is shilling.‚Äù  5. Choked by taxation and regulation  Of all the bitcoin crystal balls, this is perhaps the foggiest. ‚ÄúWe have no idea what‚Äôs going to happen with regulation,‚Äù says Wendy O. She‚Äôs encouraged by the pro-bitcoin policies in El Salvador, but worries that in the United States there‚Äôs ‚Äúso much red tape, so many public servants in so many different sectors, and nobody knows what they‚Äôll classify it as.‚Äù She sees an outright ban of bitcoin as unlikely, but fears the government could ‚Äúmake it hard to participate in the ecosystem.‚Äù  Or perhaps, as Jackson suspects, the government creates ‚Äúsome sort of bottleneck‚Äù for converting bitcoin to fiat, such as forcing you to first convert it into a CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). The way Jackson sees it, if the value of 1 bitcoin soars to $1 million in ten years ‚Äî and if they have to use the government‚Äôs digital currency as an offramp ‚Äî- then that will ‚Äútrap a lot of people into getting the CBDC, and I think that‚Äôs what they want for surveillance and control.‚Äù  Klippsten acknowledges the risk of regulation, but suspects that the politics will eventually play to bitcoin‚Äôs favor. ‚ÄúRules change according to the will of the population,‚Äù says Klippsten. ‚ÄúAt some point, there will be a lot of people that own mostly bitcoin‚Ä¶and they‚Äôll make things extremely difficult for politicians who get in their way.‚Äù  6. Shadow Bitcoins  This scenario flows directly from the last. If the government somehow succeeds in choking or over-regulating bitcoin, says Jackson, then there will naturally be a desire for ‚Äúblack market bitcoin‚Äù ‚Äî bitcoin that‚Äôs off the government‚Äôs grid. People who earn bitcoin from home mining, for example, or own bitcoin that‚Äôs tougher (if not impossible) to track with tools like Chainanalysis.  These concerns aren‚Äôt new. The FBI has been tracking bitcoin for over a decade, which some view as solid law enforcement and others see as a surveillance nightmare. So if the tracking and regulation escalates, we could live in a world of ‚Äútwo bitcoins,‚Äù or ‚Äúshadow bitcoins,‚Äù where perhaps people pay one price for Tracked Bitcoin and a premium for Shadow Bitcoin.  Then again, while Jackson acknowledges the concern, he also views this as pragmatically difficult for the government to execute. When we reach mainstream adoption, says Jackson, there will literally be billions of bitcoin wallets, so ‚Äúgood luck trying to stop all of it.‚Äù  7. Bitcoin thrives as a store of value  This one‚Äôs dead-simple, but sometimes the simplest scenarios are the most likely. Don‚Äôt sleep on common sense. ‚ÄúBitcoin's core value proposition is a global, digital store of value,‚Äù says Anthony Pompliano, aka ‚ÄúPomp‚Äù of Pomp Investments. ‚ÄúThere are other potential use cases which may come to fruition, but the core proposition is the one that‚Äôs most likely to last for decades.‚Äù  Pomp even sees a generational shift. He says that bitcoin now serves as ‚Äúthe benchmark for many young investors,‚Äù similar to how the S&P 500 is a benchmark for stock-pickers. ‚ÄúIf they can't beat bitcoin's performance,‚Äù says Pomp, ‚Äúthey simply ‚Äôbuy the index.‚Äô‚Äù  8. Machines Send Bitcoin  Back in early 2021, well before the explosion of AI-hype, Elizabeth Stark told me that she envisions a future where ‚ÄúMachines will pay machines, natively, instantly,‚Äù and that ‚ÄúTeslas will pay for charging with Lightning‚Äù over the bitcoin network.  Three years later, her prediction looks even more likely. It seems probable that machines and even robots, at some point, will need to spend money. And ‚Äúrobot‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to mean the Terminator. It could be as simple as The Internet of Things. And what are the odds that these robots or machines will be spending U.S. dollars from their accounts at Wells Fargo?  ‚ÄúBitcoin, stablecoins, and digital currencies are going to be the currency of choice for many automation use cases,‚Äù says Pomp, who argues that machines seeking instantaneous settlement ‚Äúwill be unable to use electronic money because of the multi-day settlement times. This is where bitcoin or stablecoins could really shine.‚Äù  9. Bitcoin ordinals blow up  This might seem like a well-trodden or even boring topic for those who follow the crypto space closely, but you‚Äôll get a weird look if you ask a random person in the grocery store, ‚ÄúWhat do you think of bitcoin ordinals?‚Äù (Also, please don‚Äôt do this.) Ordinals are not yet anywhere close to mainstream. But in 10 years they could be, and that could transform everything about the world of digital collectibles, making 2021‚Äôs NFT Summer look quaint by comparison.  ‚ÄúOnce we start to get closer to mass adoption, I think that people will begin to use ordinals, because they are more secure than NFTs,‚Äù says Wendy, who also suspects this is ‚Äústill a long ways away.‚Äù  10. The status quo continues  ‚ÄúI know this is not super exciting,‚Äù says Cas Piancey, cohost of the Crypto Critics‚Äô Corner podcast, ‚ÄúBut what I suspect is going to happen is that bitcoin will largely be used for the exact same things it‚Äôs used for now.‚Äù  Piancey is a self-described crypto cynic, but this doesn‚Äôt mean he loves to dunk on bitcoin. He can see the nuance. ‚ÄúWhen people argue that there isn‚Äôt a use case for bitcoin, I generally disagree with that,‚Äù he says. And he imagines that in 10 years, bitcoin will still be used on the margins for remittances; it will still be used sporadically as a tool for dissidents; and still held by many as a store of value.  He‚Äôs not a doomsdayer. So he imagines that in 10 years bitcoin will still be chugging, but cautions that, ‚ÄúPeople who say it‚Äôs going to be the next world currency are out of their minds.‚Äù  11. Bitcoin‚Äôs Death by Black Swan  Maybe bitcoin is hacked by quantum computing. Maybe there‚Äôs a 51% attack. Maybe bitcoin is gutted by ChatGPT7.  So this is something of a ‚Äúcatch-all doomsday scenario‚Äù to acknowledge, with humility, that we don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know. (I explored the doomsday risks in more detail in the original piece.) Many in the space say that bitcoin‚Äôs dominance is ‚Äúinevitable,‚Äù but very little in life is trulyinevitable ‚Äî just ask Thanos.  Isaiah Jackson is as bullish on bitcoin as you‚Äôll find, but even he acknowledges that a hack by quantum computing, for example, is still theoretically possible. He considers the risk to be low ‚Äî and suspects that evil quantum-hackers would focus first on juicier targets, like sovereign nations ‚Äî but concedes that it‚Äôs ‚Äúalways a risk.‚Äù  12. Telepathic Bitcoin  In the original Future of Bitcoin piece, Jackson provided what was easily the most fun scenario: That at some point bitcoin will be spent on Mars.  Now he‚Äôs back to outdo himself.  Jackson has been thinking about Noland Arbaughf, who is paralyzed below the shoulders. Then Arbaughf became the first patient to get a Neuralink chip implanted in his brain, and now he can play chess and even send Tweets just by thinking. ‚ÄúIt was like using the force,‚Äù Arbaughf said after he ‚Äúthought‚Äù a tweet into existence.  So Jackson realized something. If we can send Tweets just by thinking in 2024, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before we can telepathically send bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe dude just thought a tweet, and it came out,‚Äù says Jackson. Someday we‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the code for a private bitcoin wallet.‚Äù",NEUTRAL,ÏóÜÏùå,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2024/04/01/12-future-bitcoin-scenarios-from-bullish-to-bearish,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/08e2e5c23726f710455b573e4cafb009d14438c1-2107x1422.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Begins The Breakout Process Rekt Capital previously highlighted that Bitcoin has been wedged within a weekly range he dubbed Black-Black, ever since it witnessed about 18% correction. The candle-bodied peak from 2021 and the upside-wicking peak from 2021 basically created this weekly range. Related Reading: Can This Bullish Chart Pattern Propel Bitcoin Price To $75,000? He then claimed that regaining the $69,200 Range High for Bitcoin could indicate that the cryptocurrency is prepared to break out of the weekly range. Additionally, it might also signal the conclusion of the aforementioned pullback period. It appears the analyst‚Äôs forecast has come to pass as BTC has surpassed the $69,200 level, triggering a breakout activity. According to Rekt Capital, the first phase in the breakout process that Bitcoin has initiated is a Weekly Close above the Range High. However, before moving higher, BTC might need to dive into the range high in order to properly retest it as new support. As a result, it would be the second phase to validate the break out from the week range properly. The crypto expert‚Äôs analysis coincides with a recent drop in the price of Bitcoin today, raising speculations about its next movement. Bitcoin opened the day around the $71,000 threshold; a few hours later, the crypto asset fell to $69,200 level. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $69,500, indicating a decline of about 1.29% in the past day. BTC‚Äôs market cap has also decreased in the last 24 hours by the same percentage, while its daily trading volume has increased by over 52%. A Bullish Month For BTC This suggests that investors are still bullish toward the digital asset despite the retrace witnessed today. Investors are even more optimistic as Bitcoin‚Äôs halving event approaches because of the possible impact on BTC. Even though BTC began the day with a decline, several analysts still believe it might perform robustly in April. This is due to the fact that Bitcoin has mostly experienced significant growth in April over the past years. Related Reading: Bitcoin Pre-Halving Dip Expected: Will BTC Rally Before US Fed Decision? Zia Ul Haque, the Founder of Open4Profit claims that in the past April has been superior to March while providing a comparison of the monthly increases in the price of Bitcoin from 2013 until 2024.

42418530,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThXZd,1711977370,Who Will Trump Pick for Veep? Polymarket Gives Tim Scott Best Odds: Prediction Markets,"Sometime in the next few weeks, the Republicans and Democrats will announce their respective presidential candidates' running mates as the U.S. gears up for the November election.  On crypto-based prediction platform Polymarket, there's currently $13.7 million pledged toward figuring out who the Republican vice presidential candidate might be, but the market is far from forming a consensus.  South Carolina Senator Tim Scott is leading the pack with 23%. But contracts for ""other man"" and ""other woman"" have a collective 25%. Other high-profile Republicans aren't even cracking the double digits. Marco Rubio is at 4%, while Vivek Ramaswamy ‚Äì who holds more name recognition with the Discord crowd than the general electorate ‚Äì is at 3% but with $1.1 million bet on him specifically.  Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., best known for his staunch anti-vax views, is at 2%. While the scion of a Democratic dynasty hasn't quite defected to the GOP, the Twitterati had floated the idea of a unity ticket with Trump and Kennedy, though, again, that idea is farfetched and the market is reflecting its unlikelihood.  Free money?  Under a regulatory settlement, Polymarket prohibits users that reside in the United States, which creates the possibility that the platform's bettors might not be the best informed out there on the topic of American politics.  An uninformed market might be creating price discrepancies where there's a lag between a realistic chance of something happening and the market price ‚Äì in other words, opportunities for free money.  Prediction market trading house CSP Trading may have found such an instance, highlighting in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that Polymarket is giving only a 90% chance that a Democrat will take New York. If 90% sounds high, consider that the last Republican to win the state was Ronald Reagan in 1984.  Polls show that Biden will take the state by 10 points, and while that margin is narrowing, it's still a healthy lead. There may be a narrative that urban New York's ailment of crime and chaos is caused by ultra-progressive politics, with a ruling elite more concerned about pronouns in email signatures than the plight of the working stiff. But the answer to this has been a slate of moderate Democrats at all levels of government, and voters have been receptive to them. So the idea that an anti-Democrat protest vote would form seems like a longshot, perhaps wishful thinking among some of the terminally online.  Contracts for other deep blue states are presenting similar numbers. The market thinks that there's a 92% chance California goes Democrat; a 10% chance a Republican will take Washington state; and a 93% chance a Republican will take West Virginia.  Historically these are all states that have some of the longest single-party voting streaks.  California, for instance, has consistently voted Democrat since 1992 when it decided to go for Bill Clinton over a second term of George H.W. Bush and has stayed that way since. Certainly, California had its Republican moments from 1952 to 1988, but current polls have it as a definite landslide for President Joe Biden and the Democrats.  But why look a gift horse in the mouth? Betting Yes on Polymarket's ""Dems win New York"" contract stands to pay out around a 10% return ‚Äì far more than one would get from a high-interest savings account.  Hedging the weather  Betting on the weather might seem as degenerate as betting on the chance of a specific crypto project launching an airdrop this year. Compulsive gamblers looking for something new to bet on, the critics might say.  Except it's not. Weather derivatives are one of the oldest, most primitive forms of prediction markets as they are a way to hedge against extreme conditions causing crop failure. With climate change causing 2023 to be the warmest year on record, with freak, violent storms, and unexpected cold snaps, there's a new level of unpredictability ‚Äì and urgency ‚Äì involved in this.  Kalshi, the only regulated prediction market platform in the U.S., has contracts for the day's weather in a number of major American cities. When we think about weather derivatives and hedging, we often associate that with quants hired by major food conglomerates trying to make hedges in the hundreds of millions of dollars.  Kalshi's dollar-based contracts can do this at a smaller level, enough for a mom-and-pop shop selling something seasonal. An ice cream shop might want to hedge against a day of rain, or a shop selling fall and winter apparel could prepare for a late summer and unseasonably warm spring.  While you can't control the weather, you can still do something about it.  And, lastly‚Ä¶  Punters on Polymarket are betting on Donald Trump dropping the crypto B-bomb in an upcoming rally.  Some crypto people are apparently planning to hold a picture of the meme coin BODEN, a Joe Biden riff which commands a $240 million market capitalization as of Monday morning, at a Trump rally.  The idea is to get Trump to spot a large poster of Boden and call it hilarious - which punters think could pump their BODEN bags.

25082110,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600739,1711975879,"Bitcoin-Powered Core DAO (CORE) Skyrockets By 220%, Here‚Äôs Why","Core DAO (CORE), the cryptocurrency behind the Core blockchain, has seen its price skyrocket by 220% over the last week, marking a significant milestone in its market performance. As of the last 24 hours, CORE has seen an additional 63% increase, accumulating a staggering 350% gain in just nine days. This rally has elevated Core DAO to the 55th position among all cryptocurrencies by market cap. What Is Core DAO? Core DAO operates on the Core blockchain, a Layer 1, EVM-compatible platform that supports the Bitcoin network by offering a secondary BTC block reward. The Core blockchain distinguishes itself through its unique Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism‚Äîa hybrid of Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work (PoW) and a delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). This mechanism aims to address the blockchain trilemma, ensuring decentralization, scalability, and security. Related Reading: Bitwise CEO Predicts $11 Billion Drop In Bitcoin Supply Post Halving Core aims to create a strong and inclusive community within the Web 3 ecosystem, offering various features such as a stake bridge, airdrops, and a mining app to facilitate participation and engagement. The project is focused on building Web3 infrastructure and promoting public chains based on Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work consensus, boasting over 10 million transactions, 550,000 addresses, and significant social media presence‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã. As of press time, Core‚Äôs market cap was about $2.3 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of approximately $447 million. The circulating supply of CORE tokens is 875,161,702 out of a maximum supply of 2,100,000,000 CORE tokens. Factors Behind CORE‚Äôs Exponential Rally The recent price rally of CORE can be attributed to a confluence of factors, including the anticipation of the Bitcoin halving, scheduled in 20 days, and significant project announcements. One of the pivotal developments propelling Core‚Äôs rise is the soon-to-come launch of non-custodial Bitcoin staking, which is expected to boost the public chain‚Äôs TVL and favor a rise in CORE price.

CoreBTC enables Bitcoin holders to engage in the DeFi space on the Core Chain without compromising on Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational principles of trustlessness and security. This initiative paves the way for Bitcoin to become a central asset in DeFi‚Äôs future, backed by decentralized smart contracts and rigorous overcollateralization requirements. 1/ coreBTC is live on Core Chain, which means users can trustlessly bridge their BTC to a Bitcoin-secured DeFi experience on Core Chain. pic.twitter.com/6KFWdbQzbR ‚Äî Core DAO üî∂ (@Coredao_Org) March 28, 2024 Additionally, Core has kick-started a 6-month incentive program targeting the BTCfi ecosystem. This program is designed to fuel growth and adoption by rewarding contributions to the ecosystem, particularly in bridging assets and exploring decentralized applications (dApps). The initiative covers assets from various blockchains, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Avalanche, Polygon, and BNB, thereby enhancing participation in Core‚Äôs flagship dApps.

42418546,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThXq9,1711971518,Trading Volume on South Korean Crypto Exchange Upbit Crashes 75%,"Crypto trading volume has tumbled 75% from March's high as frenzied trading in altcoins eased off.  The slowdown raises a question about the sustainability of lofty market valuations for coins other than bitcoin and ether, Matrixport said.  Daily trading volume on South Korea's biggest cryptocurrency exchange has tumbled 75% from this year's high in a sign that frenzied trading in alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) has fizzled and digital assets other than market leaders bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} may struggle to maintain lofty valuations.  Upbit, which lists 192 cryptocurrencies and offers trading in 309 pairs, registered just $3.79 billion of volume in the past 24 hours, according to data source CoinGecko. That's down from as high as $15 billion on March 5, when TradingView data shows the total market cap of altcoins surged to a two-year high of $788 billion. Market cap has since steadied at about $750 billion.  ""Crypto trading volumes started skyrocketing in early March as a wave of altcoin activity hit the market,"" Matrixport said in a Telegram broadcast. ""The anticipation of the Dencun upgrade with low transaction fees caused this mania, and some political developments brought crypto to the forefront of the political election. However, with volumes declining, the sustainability of the altcoin rally comes into question.""  Daily volume on Upbit rocketed from $2 billion in the two weeks to March 5 as bitcoin's move to record highs above $70,000 and Ethereum's Dencun upgrade spurred risk-taking in other cryptocurrencies, including meme coins. Such was the trading frenzy that, at one point, volumes on South Korea-based crypto exchanges surpassed the local stock market activity.  South Korean crypto fans appear to focus more on altcoins than bitcoin and ether, the two largest cryptocurrencies by market cap. A study by DeSpread Research in October said Upbit's investors are primarily interested in maximizing profits through altcoins and tend to accept the high risks associated with these coins. Bitcoin and ether trading pairs account for a smaller portion of total volume on Upbit than on Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN), where activity is mainly concentrated in BTC an ETH.

The IPO is expected to value the exchange at more than 6 billion baht ($165 million), CEO Jirayut Srupsrisopa told Bloomberg.  The owner of Thai crypto exchange Bitkub Online plans to sell shares to the public next year and is in the process of hiring financial advisers, Bitkub Capital Group CEO Jirayut Srupsrisopa told Bloomberg.  Thailand's biggest crypto exchange provides about 80% of the Bangkok-based parent's profit and is 9.2% owned by Asphere Innovations. The initial public offering (IPO) is expected to value the exchange at more than 6 billion baht ($165 million), Jirayut said. Bitkub Capital had signaled its intention to sell shares to the public in a 2023 letter to shareholders that didn't give a timeframe, Bloomberg said.  Demand for access to cryptocurrency trading accounts has climbed alongside the gains in bitcoin {{BTC}}, which has advanced 57% this year while the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the broader crypto market, added 49%. Last month, the number of active accounts in the country reached the highest level since September 2022, Bloomberg said, citing data from the country's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Bitkub is also facing increased competition. In January, Binance Thailand ‚Äì a venture of the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume and Gulf Innova ‚Äì opened for business.  A 2022 plan for Siam Commercial Bank (SCB), Thailand‚Äôs oldest lender, to buy 51% of Bitkub Online for 17.85 billion baht was canceled after the SEC suppered the deal. In September 2022, Bitkub was included in a group sued by the SEC for allegedly artificially inflating trading volumes.

Speculation ran rampant as a single entity, purportedly controlling 11 wallets, offloaded a staggering 533.6 billion SHIB tokens, amounting to nearly $16 million in DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This unprecedented transaction, highlighted by blockchain analytics firm Spot On Chain, revealed a jaw-dropping profit of over $8 million, showcasing the extreme volatility inherent in the crypto space. Shiba Inu Massive Offloading Around 16 hours ago, 11 wallets (probably one person) jointly sold 533.6B $SHIB for 15.99M $DAI at ~$0.00003, realizing a joint profit of $8.24M (+106%) in less than a month! Currently, these 11 wallets still hold the newly acquired $DAI. Which token will they buy next? Follow‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/y0mhsMQQn4 ‚Äî Spot On Chain (@spotonchain) March 31, 2024 The repercussions of this sell-off reverberated throughout the SHIB community and the wider cryptocurrency market. Despite a minor uptick of 0.21% in SHIB‚Äôs price over the last 24 hours, the overall sentiment cooled significantly. Related Reading: Riding The Ripple: XRP Stellar 1-Year Performance Leaves Banks In The Dust Trading volume plummeted by a striking 32.27% to $550.84 million, indicating a palpable decline in investor enthusiasm and market activity. CoinGlass, a leading crypto analytics platform, reported a 1.51% decrease in SHIB‚Äôs open interest, signaling a potential shift in trader strategy amidst the tumultuous market conditions. Source: Coinglass As speculation mounts within the SHIB community, all eyes are on the 11 wallets still holding the acquired DAI. The burning question on everyone‚Äôs mind is the seller‚Äôs next move and which tokens might attract their attention next. The uncertainty surrounding the future actions of this significant market player underscores the inherent unpredictability of the crypto market and the need for investors to exercise caution and vigilance. SHIB market cap currently at $16.9 billion. Chart: TradingView.com In the aftermath of this monumental sell-off, market participants are grappling with the implications of such a seismic event. The sell-off serves as a stark reminder of the extreme volatility that characterizes the cryptocurrency landscape and the potential for swift and substantial gains or losses. Resilience: Shiba Inu Bounces Back Shiba Inu, in spite of recent fluctuations, has demonstrated resilience by recovering from setbacks and making consistent strides forward. SHIB has been in ascent mode since its March 20 low of $0.000024; it is presently trading at $0.00003050. The aforementioned resilience exemplifies SHIB‚Äôs ability to surmount obstacles and aspire to greater heights. Related Reading: Reality Check: MATIC Investors Count Losses ‚Äì More Headaches Ahead? Shiba Inu is currently going through a major phase of correction, and purchasers are finding it difficult to recover control. SHIB fails to maintain its surge, falling below $0.000010, even if it momentarily breaks the long-term resistance trendline. There is still a double-bottom formation, but sellers are in control. The continuous struggle at the trendline will probably dictate SHIB‚Äôs price trend in 2024. Meanwhile, analysts and investors alike are closely monitoring the unfolding developments stemming from this significant sell-off. The aftermath of this transaction will undoubtedly remain a focal point for SHIB enthusiasts and the broader crypto market as they navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by such market movements.

42418542,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThXo5,1711960707,Meme Coins on Degen Chain Flourish as New Layer 3 Racks up Millions in Volumes,"Degen Chain, a new layer-3 blockchain, has attracted significant attention and transactional volume since its introduction on Thursday. Its native DEGEN token has zoomed 500% since its release.  The network does not have a supported stablecoin and primarily housed speculative tokens as of Monday, but that hasn't stopped speculators from trading millions of dollars in volumes.  The hot ball of money chasing meme coins from Solana to Base networks has found its way to Degen Chain, a so-termed layer-3 blockchain built on top of Base that began operations last Thursday.  The four-day-old network has recorded nearly $100 million in transactional volumes in the past 24 hours alone over 272,00 unique transactions, data show. On-chain analysts say over 7,500 contracts and 2,300 tokens have been floated on the network since Thursday‚Äîalbeit mostly rug pulls or scams.  The biggest token by capitalization is that of Degen Swap (DSWAP), an exchange built on Degen Chain, which was valued at just over $14 million as of Monday morning. Non-serious token Degen Pepe (DPEPE) has a higher valuation at $23 million, but is a meme coin with no use beyond speculation.  Scores of tokens have a market capitalization of under $1 million, and are mainly serving as speculative bets.  The network had no supported stablecoins as of Monday, and users can transact or trade only with the native DEGEN tokens. DEGEN changed hands at 6 cents as of European morning hours, up more than 500% from Thursday‚Äôs 1 cent levels, data shows.  What is a Layer 3?  Degen Chain is a layer 3 network built specifically for the DEGEN token. A relatively new development, a layer-3 blockchain is a customizable and application-specific blockchain built on top of layer-2 protocols. Layer 2s are networks built on a layer-1 blockchain such as Ethereum or Solana that can settle transactions faster and more cheaply than the underlying system.  The general idea behind a layer-3 network is to have a blockchain that can quickly and verifiably complete a very specific set of tasks.

25073957,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600684,1711959040,Dogecoin Price Poised For Massive 600% Rally In April: Crypto Analyst,"Dogecoin, a frontrunner in the meme coin genre of crypto, is showing bullish signals on its technical charts that could indicate an impending rally, according to noted crypto analyst Ali Martinez. Via X, he stated: I feel my fellow degens have been distracted with the new shiny memecoins, but Dogecoin remains the most important altcoin in this sector. From a technical perspective, DOGE seems to mirror the 2018-2021 pattern. If so, DOGE could be at the very beginning of a massive parabolic bull run! The weekly DOGE/USD price chart presents a descending triangle pattern, typically bearish, that has emerged since its peak in May 2021. However, the price action of recent months has been decidedly bullish, with Dogecoin breaking above the triangle‚Äôs upper trendline already in November 2023. This move invalidated the bearish sentiment often associated with this pattern, signaling a strong shift in market dynamics. With the monthly close for March, the Dogecoin price has crossed the significant 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level of the downtrend, situated at approximately $0.19057, hinting at further upside potential. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.2072 reflecting an 86% increase in March. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Hits Record $2.2 Billion ‚Äì What‚Äôs Next For DOGE Price? The Fibonacci retracement levels laid out on the chart are based on the swing high and low of the previous market cycles. If Dogecoin continues to adhere to the Fibonacci levels as it has historically, the immediate target would be the 0.618 level at $0.26241, followed by the 0.786 level at $0.41376 and the all-time high at $0.73905. Extending into the price discovery, the Fibonacci extension levels are mapped out at $1.54481 (1.272 Fib level), $2.27007 (1.414 Fib level), and $3.94628 (1.618 Fib level), and $6.22241 (1.786 Fib level). These figures represent future areas of interest where the price might find resistance in the event of a continued upward trajectory. Martinez‚Äôs analysis also includes a projection based on Dogecoin‚Äôs price action from the 2018-2021 bull market, represented by the light gray line on the chart. This projected trajectory is extrapolated from the past price pattern and suggests a parabolic rise for DOGE. Notably, the DOGE price could already skyrocket in April if history repeats. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Breaks New 3-Year High ‚Äì Here Are Factors That Could Drive The Price To $1 According to Martinez‚Äôs projection, if Dogecoin follows the historical pattern, its price could potentially surge to nearly $1.5 by April, which would represent a 600% rally. This price target is further supported by the Fibonacci extension levels, with $1.54481 (1.272 Fib level) serving as a prospective hurdle. Subsequently, the DOGE price could initially require a slowdown and remain stuck in a consolidation zone between the previous all-time high and the 1,272 Fib for several months. The rally could then continue according to Martinez‚Äôs projection. In a similarly explosive move, DOGE could rise above $1.50 and then pulverize the Fib levels at $2.27007 (1.414 Fib level), $3.94628 (1.618 Fib level), and $6.22241 (1.786 Fib level) until the rally stalls again at just over $6.30. A final move could see Dogecoin break above $11.11 (2.0 Fib level) where it could find a cycle high, according to the analyst. At press time, the DOGE price was at $0.2077.

42418544,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcThXp7,1711952563,Bitcoin Becomes More Volatile Than Ether as Halving Approaches,"The spread between bitcoin and ether‚Äôs annualized 30-day historical volatility gauges increased to the highest in at least a year, according to data tracked by Kaiko.  The spot ETF inflows and Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs impending halving seem to have catalyzed greater volatility in BTC.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value and trading volumes, is supposed to be relatively steady compared to other digital assets, protecting a trader‚Äôs portfolio from wild swings in the broader market.  However, bitcoin has been more volatile than ether {{ETH}} recently.  Bitcoin‚Äôs annualized 30-day historical or realized volatility rose to nearly 60% late last week, surpassing ether‚Äôs 30-day realized volatility by nearly 10 percentage points. That‚Äôs the highest spread in at least a year, according to data tracked by Paris-based Kaiko. Historical volatility indicates the degree of price turbulence observed over a specific period.  The bitcoin-ether volatility spread flipped positive weeks after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) greenlighted nearly a dozen spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), allowing traders to take exposure to the cryptocurrency without owning it.  Since then, traders have been squarely focused on the activity in the spot ETFs, with net inflows breeding upside volatility in bitcoin and the broader crypto market. In the meantime, the dwindling probability of the SEC approving an ETH ETF by May seems to have demotivated ether traders.  Bitcoin blockchain‚Äôs upcoming reward halving, a quadrennial event that reduces the pace of per block BTC emission by 50%, could be another reason for relatively higher volatility in the cryptocurrency.  On April 21, the inbuilt code will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC, halving the miner‚Äôs revenue, which, as per ByteTree, is currently at $26 billion annually.  The consensus is that halving is bullish as it halves the pace of supply expansion, creating a demand-supply imbalance in favor of a price rise, assuming the demand side remains unchanged or strengthens. Bitcoin chalked out stellar rallies, setting new record highs over 12-18 months following the previous halvings, which occurred in November 2012, July 2016, and May 2020.  What‚Äôs different this time is that bitcoin has surpassed the previous bull market peak of around $69,000 weeks ahead of the halving, which makes the upcoming event all the more exciting for traders.  Per Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, the bullish positioning ahead of the halving means potential for a ‚Äúsell-the-news"" pullback after the event.  ‚ÄúThe current positioning being so extended is setting the market up for a VERY interesting 'sell-the-news‚Äô halving cycle play,‚Äù Magadini said in the weekly newsletter. ‚ÄúShould there be a real pullback, we stand to see excessive ‚àÜ1 [futures] OI become liquidated, volatility RR-skew to favor puts and a collapsing basis.‚Äù  Magadini added that bitcoin‚Äôs options market has been pricing the halving event as well.  ‚ÄúIf we look at the options market, we see an interesting structure.

25070458,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=600668,1711951811,Riding The Ripple: XRP Stellar 1-Year Performance Leaves Banks In The Dust,"XRP holders are facing mixed signals. While the digital asset boasts nearly 20% in gains over the past year, significantly outperforming traditional savings accounts, its recent performance pales in comparison to other cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Reality Check: MATIC Investors Count Losses ‚Äì More Headaches Ahead? After a substantial decline, the altcoin‚Äôs price has now entered a phase of sideways consolidation, making market players unsure of its future course. It appears like the cryptocurrency will likely stay stuck in a narrow range until there is a breakout in either way. XRP: Beating Savings Accounts Despite the seemingly negative vibe, a recent report highlighted the coin‚Äôs resilience. Specifically, it underscored its advantage over stagnant savings accounts. XRP hit a low of $0.42 in March 2023 and surged to $0.93 in July, fueled by optimism surrounding the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit. The coin then saw a rise of 1.30% on Sunday. After losing 1.35% on Saturday, the altcoin gained 0.41% at the end of the week to close at $0.6299. Today, it sits at $0.61, reflecting a 20% year-over-year increase. This dwarfs the returns offered by most savings accounts. A Business Insider report pegs the average Annual Percentage Yield (APY) for US savings accounts between 0.01% and 0.25%. Even high-yield online banks rarely surpass 5.30% APY. XRP is up over 6% within a single year, it has outperformed every savings account of every bank in the world and yet you people are still crying about it. pic.twitter.com/GGxVPJfudU ‚Äî Mr. Huberüî•ü¶Öüî• (@Leerzeit) March 29, 2024 ‚ÄúMr. Huber,‚Äù a prominent crypto community investigator, emphasizes this point. To paraphrase his views, he said while XRP might not be setting the crypto world on fire right now, it‚Äôs definitely a better option than letting your money languish in a savings account. However, discontent simmers within the community. Over the past three months, XRP has seen a meager 1% growth, while rivals like Bitcoin and Ethereum have skyrocketed by over 50%. This lackluster performance compared to its peers is causing frustration among holders. XRP market cap currently at $33.6 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The future trajectory of XRP hinges on multiple factors. The ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit, which centers around whether XRP is a security, is a significant cloud hanging over the coin‚Äôs price. A favorable outcome could reignite investor confidence and propel XRP upwards. Diverse Perspectives And Pressure In The Crypto Market Another factor is the broader cryptocurrency market. If the current bull run continues and other top coins maintain their momentum, XRP might face additional pressure to catch up. Analysts remain divided on XRP‚Äôs short-term prospects. Some believe the current stagnation is a buying opportunity before a potential price surge. Others urge caution, citing the ongoing lawsuit and the unpredictable nature of the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Buckle Up, XRP Hodlers: Wild Ride To $100 Incoming, According To This Analyst The diverse perspectives surrounding XRP showcase the exciting array of options available to investors. With XRP presenting a compelling alternative to conventional savings methods, its unique features shine through. Despite recent fluctuations in its performance compared to other digital assets, this opens up opportunities for thoughtful consideration and strategic investment. Ultimately, the choice to embrace XRP hinges on aligning with one‚Äôs personal risk appetite and long-term investment objectives, empowering individuals to make informed decisions tailored to their financial aspirations.
