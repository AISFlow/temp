But in the wake of The DAO's demise, new efforts are beginning to emerge that seek to address the challenges developers have so far faced working with smart contracts, the key building blocks that underlined the project and whose exploitation led to its failure.  One such startup is Legalese, a project that grew out of internal efforts at seed accelerator JFDI Asia, and boasts a notable co-founder of that operation among its ranks.  Co-founded by Virgil Griffith and Wong Meng Weng, Legalese is an open-source project writing a new programming language specifically for smart contracts. Called L4, the language is designed to help coders properly vet contracts before they go live.  After winning $8,888 from a grants program offered by autonomous financial project String Labs, Griffith said he’s ready to continue his work with a team of established leaders in the industry.  Griffith told CoinDesk:  ""The fundamental idea is that we wanted to create a programming language for law. Basically it is a mathematical way to describe obligations and relationships.""  Using what is called the modal mu-calculus, Griffth and Wong, who previously designed the email infrastructure RFC4408, beat out about 30 other applicants for the grant.  New programming language  Legalese’s flagship offering is the L4 formal language, designed to make it easier for programmers to release smart contracts for public use without needing to have those contracts vetted.  Coders, the project leads said, would write in L4 which would then convert into Solidity, ethereum's newly created programming language. This language could then be compiled to byte code, which would be read and interpreted by ethereum virtual machines (EVMs), the component of the protocol that reads and handles the dynamic instructions.  The project's first product is a software-as-a-service application designed to help entrepreneurs complete paperwork for an angel or seed round, including encoding shareholder agreements, corporate resolutions, rights notices and corporate resolutions.  In the future, Legalese’s work could help prevent the release of code with loopholes that can be exploited by attackers, according to String Labs co-founder and Blockchain University co-founder Tom Ding.  Ding said:  ""When you write the contract you want to catch all the bugs. Lawyers use their education and experience to catch loopholes and smart contracts need the same.""  Open chain grants  Also announced By String Labs, on-chain credit history startup Distory won $10,000 to build a credit history system that that travels with users across borders.  The online credit histories could then be used by other smart contracts to facilitate both online and offline borrowing.  ""The ultimate idea is to lower the cost of transaction,"" said Ding.  Legalese and Distory are the first winners of what Ding hopes will be an ongoing cycle of grants funding projects specifically built on public blockchains.

42399134,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSY8,1468350935,Dutch Central Bank Prepares its Boldest Blockchain Experiment Yet,"The central bank of the Netherlands is preparing an ambitious experiment aimed at discerning if an entire financial market can be built on a blockchain.  While many so-called smart contract applications of blockchains can be replicated using existing technology, the man in charge of a series of experiments conducted by De Nederlandsche Bank says the distributed nature of blockchains could lead to entirely re-imagined financial market infrastructures (FMIs), ones that are much more difficult to hack.  Like the bitcoin network itself, the experiment envisions how an FMI's internal operations could be distributed among participating nodes. To game the system – and break the financial market infrastructure — an attacker would need to gain more than half the computing power running the nodes.  News of the experiment, scheduled to begin later this year, comes as financial market infrastructures are increasingly being targeted by hackers. Earlier this month, the chairman of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) went so far as to call for immediate action on potential solutions to the issue.  Now in a new interview, De Nederlandsche Bank's head of market infrastructure, Ron Berndsen, explained why he believes blockchain could be the key to preventing more attacks.  Berndsen told CoinDesk:  ""If hackers were to go through the trouble of taking down two or three data centers they would take down the financial markets infrastructure. With blockchain, you could distribute the nodes and you might not even know where they are.""  To learn if an FMI can be distributed via a blockchain, Berndsen is once again tapping into the team he assembled for earlier experiments at the central bank.  Berndsen said he recruited the team of seven around coffee machines and via email invitations sent to bitcoin enthusiasts he identified within the bank.  The academic and banker is rare in the world of global financial bankers in that he began running a full node on the bitcoin network and mining the digital currency in the early part of 2013. Though he said he never earned a mining reward for his efforts, he purchased bitcoin and other digital currencies to learn the advantages and disadvantages of each.  Lessons for central banks  As a result of that familiarity, Berndsen has been able to scale up his experiments.  Announced  last month, the central bank began using the open-source bitcoin software to recreate conditions at the network's inception in 2009 in an effort to model what the system might look like in 2140, when the last bitcoin is mined.  ""As an academic it was very obvious to recreate the extreme points,"" said Berndsen, who has a doctorate in economics and is a professor of FMIs and systemic risk at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. However, he said he now believes the test to be among the more unique globally.  ""I thought every central bank would have done this,"" he said, adding:  ""I’m on many central bank committees and I expected they were all doing this, but so far they weren’t.""  Among the lessons he learned from the experiments, is that the bank was able to mine what the team called DNBcoins at a much faster rate by starting with an initial block reward of 1bn DNBcoins and halving the reward every two minutes.  Of note, he said his team observed that even if what they call the ""max money parameter"" was set to 21 million coins — as is the case with bitcoin — they were able to mine 10 billion coins.  They also ""proved"" that a network could continue to run on fees alone after the bitcoin reward is dispersed, he said.  High stakes  The third experiment, Berndsen said, will now be aimed in the area of financial markets infrastructure.  As defined by the Bank for International Settlements in a 2012 report, an FMI is a ""multilateral system among participating institutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions.""  In Berndsen’s speech announcing the results of his first two experiments, he listed FMIs as one of three crucial components of ""the overarching goal of financial stability"" that his bank aims to provide.  But this year has proven a turning point in the history of FMIs, which have become increasingly alluring targets for sophisticated international attacks.  In March, Bloomberg reported that hackers linked to the Iranian government had attacked about four dozen US financial institutions, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.  A month after the report, security expert Eugen Kapersky predicted an increase in financial market threats following a separate attack against Bangladesh’s central bank by hackers who moved the Russian ruble’s exchange rate, according to another Bloomberg report.  The threats against FMIs has been so pervasive that earlier this month the chairman of the BIS Benoit Coeure published “Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures.”  In the report Coeure wrote:  ""FMIs should immediately take necessary steps in concert with relevant stakeholders to improve their cyber resilience, taking into account this guidance. FMIs should also, within 12 months of the publication of this guidance, have developed concrete plans to improve their capabilities.""  Preparing for the big day  Holland’s central bank has been taking an increasingly public position in its efforts to lead other central banks to consider blockchain applications for a wide-range of possible solutions, now including financial market infrastructures.  In addition to speaking about their bitcoin blockchain experiments at last month’s Dutch Blockchain Conference, the bank last week announced its plans to open a blockchain campus by early September of this year.  Berndsen said it will take years before the full potential of blockchain becomes clear, and that his bank is working to help accelerate that learning curve.  In preparation for the FMI experiment, Berndsen told CoinDesk De Nederlandsche Bank is currently ""engaged"" with other parties in the industry and other central banks to see if they want to join the experiment as partners.  Berndsens said:  ""We have the idea that this next prototype might require more coding, more thinking and we might need more people.""

Speaking to Financial News, Jeremy Shaw, head of trade finance for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, said that the area is just one in which the bank is looking at possible distributed ledger applications. The comments came during a broader conversation about the topic of trade finance and its future.  He told the publication.  ""I think you need to take a different view and reinvent how you do business. We have a team looking at it from the blockchain perspective, for example, to look at how the distributed ledger can be used across multiple different products, and trade is one of those. I personally believe we need to look at the business from a different perspective.""

42399124,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSRF,1468342723,IBM to Open Blockchain Development Center With Singapore Regulators,"IBM expanded its blockchain efforts in Singapore today with news it will open the Center for Blockchain Innovation in partnership with the Singapore government.  Coming just week after the company announced it would open a new facility in Singapore for 5,000 computer scientists, today’s news is suggestive of what has been called a high level of support for blockchain technology in the region.  Robert Morris, vice-president of Global Labs at IBM Research, said in a statement that advances in cloud services are making the distributed ledger technology more widely accessible in new regions and industries.  Morris said:  ""This is IBM's first collaboration with the private sector and multiple government agencies within the same country to explore the use of blockchain and cognitive technologies to improve business transactions across several different industries.""  The Innovation Center is co-located in the Watson Center announced last month and will be staffed with technical talent from Singapore as well as researchers from IBM Research Labs worldwide.  Work across industries  In collaboration with the Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) the center’s first project will focus on using blockchain to improve multi-party trade finance efficiencies.  The projects are expected to involve global banks and emerging financial technology companies aligned with the vision of MAS, Singapore's Central Bank, to further develop Singapore's financial services, according to the statement.  IBM expects to work with the Port Authority of Singapore to improve supply chain efficiencies with the goal of attracting international trade to Singapore.  Over the next three years, the Blockcahin Center will be expected to deliver a number of technology pilots across the finance and trade industries.

42399123,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSOI,1468336869,Santander Names Blythe Masters Senior Blockchain Advisor,"Banco Santander has named Digital Asset Holdings (DAH) CEO Blythe Masters to a new role as senior blockchain advisor.  Masters previously held a non-executive position as chair of the board of Santander Consumer USA, a division of the company that specializes in auto lending, a seat she resigned from in conjunction with the news.  According to a press release from Santander, Masters is taking on a newly created role, while also joining Banco Santander's International Advisory Board and the board of its online bank, Openbank.  In statements, Banco Santander Executive Chairman Ana Botín said:  ""Blythe will bring her expertise in banking, business and blockchain where it will have significant impact to our digital bank, International Advisory Board and strategy team. She has done an outstanding job for SC, and I'm looking forward to her focusing on our global efforts in digital banking.""  No details about how the move would affect DAH's strategy, if at all, were immediately available. The startup received upwards of $60m in early 2016 to provide distributed ledger infrastructure for asset settlement, and has since signed deals with the DTCC and the Australian Securities Exchange.  Santander InnoVentures, the company’s venture capital arm, participated in the funding round.  As noted by The Wall Street Journal, the resignation follows action taken by the US Federal Reserve against Santander Consumer USA last week for failure to meet regulatory standards on business operations.  With the news, board member William Rainer will now serve as chair of the board.  Digital Asset Holdings did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

42399126,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSQG,1468333257,South African Bank Joins R3 Blockchain Consortium,"One of South Africa's largest banks has joined the global blockchain consortium led by R3CEV.  Absa Bank, a subsidiary of Barclays Africa, announced today that it would be joining the 40-plus consortium, which includes a range of banks and non-bank financial institutions worldwide. Recent participants have included Chinese bank Ping An and the financial arm of automaker Toyota.  The partnership is said to include an effort to develop a broader working group within South Africa focused on regional distributed ledger networks, with the goal of creating ""the continent’s first distributed ledger-based banking solution"".  Andrew Baker, CIO for corporate and investment banking at Barclays Africa, said in a statement:  ""We see huge potential for financial institutions in Africa to embrace disruptive technologies like blockchain, and use them to empower individuals and improve the lives of their customers. However, its true value will only be realized if we work together to co-develop and share solutions to common problems.""  The consortium has spent the last year both adding new members as well as testing blockchain solutions in trials involving multiple banking participants. R3 announced its own distributed ledger solution, dubbed Corda, in April.  Absa Bank was not immediately available for comment when reached.

42399122,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbiSNJ,1468327578,SolidX Seeking to List Bitcoin ETF on New York Stock Exchange,"A second firm has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a bid to launch an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that would offer exposure to bitcoin.  Blockchain technology firm SolidX announced today it has filed a registration statement with the SEC to launch the SolidX Bitcoin Trust. According to the S-1 filing, the trust will issue shares that represent units of ownership in the trust, with SolidX Management LLC acting as the custodian of bitcoin held by the trust. Bank of New York Mellon, in turn, will act as the administrator of the trust and custodian for its cash holdings.  Shares in the trust will be issued in blocks of 10,000 shares to authorized participants, described in the filing as registered broker-dealers who would create and redeem the blocks in baskets, for the delivery of cash (or bitcoins). Bitcoins in the trust, the filing said, would either be sourced on bitcoin exchanges or in over-the-counter (OTC) transactions.  According to the company, the trust will be managed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""XBTC"". Prices will be quoted using the TradeBlock XBX Index.  As noted by industry advocacy group Coin Center, a notable difference between the SolidX Bitcoin Trust and the competing Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is that the former has secured insurance that would cover the loss or theft of bitcoins in the trust.  ""The Trust maintains three separate levels of insurance coverage to cover the loss of bitcoin held by the Trust: crime, excess crime and excess vault,"" the filing reads.  In its most recent 29th June filing with the SEC, Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust sponsor Digital Asset Services, LLC indicated it will not insure bitcoins it holds in conjunction with the investment vehicle.  Founded in 2014, SolidX raised $3m from investors including Liberty City Ventures, Red Sea Ventures and Red Swan Ventures with the goal of offering 'total return swaps' to large institutional bitcoin investors.  As such, in the filing, SolidX stated it believes its latest offering is better suited for institutional investors than direct bitcoin purchases:  ""The sponsor believes that shareholders will be able to more effectively implement strategic and tactical asset allocation strategies that use bitcoin by investing in the shares than by purchasing, holding and trading bitcoin directly.""  SolidX declined to offer additional comment.
