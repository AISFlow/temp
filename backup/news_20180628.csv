42429308,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFdh,1530222331,"Love It or Hate It, Akon's 'Crypto Wakanda' Is Coming","It's an undertaking that can't be exaggerated: Akon – the American-Senegalese R&B singer, songwriter and producer – is creating a new cryptocurrency called ""Akoin.""  Yes, you heard that right.  As Akon tells it  , the forthcoming coin will serve as the currency for a yet-to-be-developed city in the country of Senegal. The ""Akon Crypto City"" will occupy a reported 2,000 acres of land gifted to the singer by the president of Senegal and is envisioned to be a ""100% crypto-based city with Akoin at the center of transaction life.""  And that's not all.  Akoin, while also being a transactional currency, is a key component to the broader ""Akoin Ecosystem"" founded to empower youth all over the African continent through a ""suite of blockchain-powered apps"" that allow young entrepreneurs to ""buy, hold and spend cryptocurrency right from their smartphone"", as stated on the coin's official webpage.  The cryptocurrency's unveiling and, more importantly, its use for both the development of a ""crypto-based city"" and as the underpinning of a cause to empower African youth, has arguably launched the celebrity of Akon to whole new level.  Triple threat  It bears mentioning that part of the enthusiasm and support on social media for Akon has been a long time coming.  Back in 2014, the Grammy-nominated singer started a for-profit company dubbed ""Akon Lighting Africa"" with the help of his two friends, Thione Niang and Samba Bathily.  The idea was to broaden electrical access to areas of Africa. Funded by a $1 billion credit line, Akon Lighting Africa has gone on to install 100,000 solar street lamps in 480 rural communities across 15 different African countries.  Praise for Akon – not only as a singer but as an entrepreneur and philanthropist impacting the Senegalese people and the African continent more generally – is one of the reasons why his name continues to be in the social media spotlight.  And for what it's worth, the multi-platinum album-selling artist himself isn't one to shy away from attention.  Talking at Cannes Lions in a panel moderated by People deputy editor JD Heyman, Akon stated he was preparing to confront the President of the United States, Donald Trump, during the 2020 presidential elections.  ""I'm going to go after Trump… I'm going to come in with a team so crazy, man, it's all going down. I'm not holding my tongue,"" he said.  For all the talk of Akon's new plans to launch a cryptocurrency, build a crypto city and take on the president of the U.S., it's no wonder people are likening him to Marvel superhero character Black Panther, and his planned city with Wakanda, the fictional utopia.  You must be joking  The social media response to Akon's plans weren't all positive or supportive, however.  One user on Reddit thought of the announcement was one big joke, asking ""Is this the Onion?"" in reference to the American satirical newspaper.  Still others on Twitter made jabs at the celebrity's image, taking clips from past music videos by Akon and referencing the names of hip-hop artists with whom he has collaborated.  But two can play at that game.  Because of the chatter – both hopeful and cynical – there is undoubtedly a great degree of interest around the impact that Akoin could have on Senegal, depending on how the cryptocurrency plans shake out – first and foremost being its official launch.

42429298,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFNh,1530207915,Block.one Wants to Rewrite the Entire EOS Constitution,"EOS is experiencing what might be considered a full-blown constitutional crisis.  Revealed Thursday on Telegram, Block.one – the company that designed the EOS protocol but turned the code over to its users at launch – proposed that the rules governing behavior on the platform be scrapped and replaced with a ""v2.0.""  Envisioned  as a ""holistic blueprint for a globally scalable blockchain society"" governed by a written constitution, EOS completed its launch just two weeks ago, but disputes over stolen private keys immediately tested the viability of its governance structures.  In particular, the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF), a body meant to settle disputes among participants, has drawn criticism for ordering that seven EOS addresses be frozen by the block producers who maintain the ledger. It then drew additional criticism when a fake order circulated, making it clear the off-chain process was vulnerable to even amateur spoofing attacks.  But on Tuesday, Block.one CTO Dan Larimer went so far as to state that he's had enough.  Larimer, whose other projects include Steem and BitShares, wrote on Telegram that ""damage to [the] community from ECAF is greater than funds we hope to restore to users"" and said he'd clarify his thoughts in a blog post, which was published Wednesday.  That post turned out to be a ""proposed EOS constitution referendum,"" though, in fact, his goal was a complete replacement of the old document with a new set of rules.  ""Am I correct,"" a Telegram user asked Larimer Tuesday (before he'd published the proposal), ""in understanding you're proposing removal of the entire current constitution, and replacing it with one that only refers to arbs [arbitrators] being able to rule on code VS intent and code vulnerabilities / hacks like DAO?""  Larimer responded with one word: ""yes.""  A post on Block.one's website Thursday made it clear that Larimer was not acting in a personal capacity, but that his desired constitutional overhaul was endorsed by the company behind the EOS protocol. The post, a lightly edited version of Larimer's post the previous day, also clarified that the ""referendum"" was, in fact, a ""proposal for EOS Constitution v2.0.""  Code is (mostly) law  Block.one's post explains that the concept of ""code is law"" – that blockchain networks can only be governed to the extent that actors can be controlled by software protocols – is compelling, but fails to recognize ""that bugs/extraordinary events will happen and that the community needs a process to establish the intent of the smart contracts in order to quickly resolve issues in a transparent and predictable way, when they do occur.""  It suggests ""ending all protocol-level arbitration orders other than to render non-binding opinions on the intent of the code,"" but leaves room for ECAF and, in principle, competing arbitration forums – when all parties in a contract agree to be bound by the decision ahead of time.  Those agreements and any code implementing them, however, would be at the application layer.  For Ferdous Bhai, founder of 21MIL, which runs a (non-validating) block producer though the cryptocurrency exchange ChainRift, told CoinDesk that Block.one's proposed constitution is ""a huge improvement over the original one,"" but still unenforceable.  He went on to say:  ""Anything not enforceable won't be enforced, so there's no point in having a constitution IMO [in my opinion].""  Many involved in EOS see the constitution as being the whole point, but for Bhai – who has been banned from an EOS Telegram channel for his vocal opinions on the matter – EOS is a promising technology for building decentralized applications (dapps). The constitution, in his view, only introduces ""unnecessary drama and politics.""

42429292,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLxFDh,1530205326,Zcash Votes Against ASIC Resistance In Boon for Big Miners,"Members of the zcash community have voted not to prioritize research efforts that would seek to alter the software's rules so as to prevent powerful ASIC mining hardware.  According to the results of a governance panel led by the Zcash Foundation and announced at the Zcon0 conference in Montreal on Thursday, the ballot, which proposed to prioritize ASIC resistance and ""discourag[e] the use of ASIC mining equipment in favor of [graphics card] mining equipment,"" saw 19 votes in favor, with 45 votes against the proposal.  As detailed by CoinDesk, the emergence of ASICs has been the source of division in the community.  This approach is valued by some because it enables a wider array of miners to participate, especially those who do not have the resources to purchase ASICs, which can cost thousands of dollars apiece compared to several hundred for a GPU. This approach, some would argue, makes for a more decentralized network of miners.  Andrew Miller, president of the Zcash Foundation, said he was ""surprised"" by the outcome, telling attendees:  ""This is a fairly strong signal of disagreement. My interpretation of this is that we're not going to make any hasty decisions like diverting all of the Zcash Foundation resources to promoting ASIC resistance.""  The governance panel included 64 elected individuals from the cryptocurrency's community, which voted on seven different ballots in the weeks prior to the conference.  That's not to say that the issue is being left untouched entirely.  Indeed, in a separate ballot, the governance panel voted 38-to-26 to research longer-term solutions, such as more ""thermodynamically efficient"" consensus algorithms, as well as studies into open-source hardware, according to the results.  In a mining workshop at the conference Tuesday, members of the Zcash Company, the primary entity that maintains zcash code, said it would define a more formal stance on ASICs prior to the coming Sapling upgrade in October.  Operating independently of the Zcash Company, the Zcash Foundation is intending to decentralize the decision-making power on the network through the governance panel. Speaking at the conference, Miller said the governance panel is broadly intended to inform the foundation's priorities for the year.  ""We want to include ideas of open governance, including community involvement in our decision making is a key part of what we're trying to do,"" Miller said.  Another ballot included a question about transferring ownership of the zcash trademark from the Zcash Company to the foundation. That measure saw 48 votes in favor against 15 who disagreed.  The panel also voted to elect Clovyr CEO Amber Baldet and Ian Miers, co-founder of zcash, as new board members of the Foundation.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, Alexander Vinnik has been at the center of an international dispute ever since he was indicted by U.S. officials. At the time, the US government also slapped BTC-e with an $110 million fine, a move that came hours after reports of Vinnik's arrest first emerged. And despite going offline following the arrest and fine announcements, BTC-e ultimately re-emerged under the name WEX.  Since then, Russia and American officials have wrangled in the Grecian court system in an effort to extradite him to their respective countries. All the while, Vinnik has maintained his innocence, though a court ruled in December that he could be extradited to the US.  According to the Associated Press, France is seeking to intervene as a final determination on Vinnik's future is made. France's government wants to put Vinnik on trial for a string of charges including ""cybercrime, money laundering, and membership in a criminal organization and extortion"", sources told the news service.  As such, the French request adds a new wrinkle to the dispute, and according to the AP, Vinnik is fighting the new extradition request.  ""A legal issue that will require our attention is which (extradition request) will have priority, as they are based on two international arrest warrants and one European arrest warrant,"" Ilias Spyrliadis, Vinnik's lawyer, was quoted as saying.

Templum Markets, the result of Templum's February acquisition of Liquid M Capital, is a registered broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS) which lists tokenized securities on its platform.  CUSIP (or Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures) numbers are nine-digit identifiers found on all securities within the U.S. and Canada, as well as certain offerings by firms in the EU, according to Investopedia.  These identifiers can be used to track assets within investor portfolios, the release explains. There are already more than 10 million different securities, stocks, initial public offerings, funds and more within the system.  Chris Pallotta, Templum's CEO, said in a statement that assigning CUSIP numbers to security tokens helps create new standards and best practices within the cryptocurrency space, adding that ""this is truly a watershed moment in the evolution and adoption of security tokens.""  Templum Markets chief executive Vince Molinari agreed, adding:  ""We are focused on bringing standardization and best practices for our issuers, enabling them to better communicate information about their products to potential investors. Our vision is to create increased liquidity opportunities for TAOs through our secondary trading ATS, and adding a CUSIP on each one is an important step toward achieving that goal.""

In a new letter published Thursday, Sam Woods, chief executive of the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – a financial services regulator in the U.K. – wrote that banks, insurance companies and investment firms should take steps to protect themselves against market volatility and potentially risky investments in the crypto space.  The deputy governor's warning focused strictly on the tokens themselves, reminding financial institutions that they have a fiduciary responsibility under PRA regulations.  Woods wrote:  ""In their short history, crypto-assets have exhibited high price volatility and relative illiquidity. Crypto-assets also raise concerns related to misconduct and market integrity – many appear vulnerable to fraud and manipulation, as well as money-laundering and terrorist financing risks. Entering into activity related to crypto-assets may give also rise to reputational risks.""  The letter further stated that financial institutions should take steps to minimize any possible risk caused by trading in crypto assets, including having a PRA-approved Senior (Insurance) Management Function auditor review and authorize risk assessment frameworks for dealing with the new class.  Firms must also avoid excessive risk-taking, ensure access to experts in crypto assets and conduct due diligence on any assets they may want to trade in.  ""Classification of crypto-asset exposures for prudential purposes should reflect firms' comprehensive assessment of the risks involved,"" Woods wrote, adding that these classifications should cite potential risks when investing in cryptocurrencies.  The deputy governor also pushed back against the idea that cryptocurrencies are a form of money, saying ""crypto-assets should not be considered as a currency for prudential purposes.""  In the letter, Woods also took the time to acknowledge that distributed ledgers and blockchain technology exist separately from cryptocurrencies, writing, ""We also recognise that the underlying distributed ledger or cryptographic technologies, on which many crypto-assets rely, have significant potential to benefit the efficiency and resilience of the financial system over time.""

Released by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on June 21 and submitted last December, the application outlines a method for integrating blockchains into additive manufacturing – commonly known as 3-D printing – to create a database that validates and verifies the manufacturing process.  In other words, the technology would enable the company to create a blockchain-based manufacturing history that can help with tracking and authenticating 3D-printed objects.  The invention would tackle challenges existing in the current systems for additive manufacturing, which ""lack verification and validation systems for ensuring that objects produced by the process are appropriately certified,"" according to the application.  Due to this issue, if a replacement part for an industrial asset is produced using an additive manufacturing process, anyone with access to a 3-D printer could reproduce that part. As a result, end users can't verify whether the replacement part ""was produced using a correct build file, using correct manufacturing media, and on a properly configured additive manufacturing device.""  GE states in the filing:  ""It would therefore be desirable to provide systems and methods for implementing a historical data record of an additive manufacturing process with verification and validation capabilities that may be integrated into additive manufacturing devices.""  The move is just the latest sign of interest in blockchain technology by the industrial behemoth. Last year, the USPTO released five patent applications, all filed in 2016, which each described a different blockchain application to aid in the streamlining of aircraft maintenance.

42429277,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Fh,1530191719,Messaging Giant Line to Launch Crypto Exchange in July,"Line, the company behind a popular messaging app, announced Thursday that it will open a cryptocurrency exchange in July.  The new exchange, known as BitBox, was unveiled during a conference held this week in Japan. Notably, the exchange won't offer services to residents in Japan and the U.S. – a likely nod to the regulatory realities of working in those markets.  In an announcement release, Line said that the exchange would be purely crypto-to-crypto, meaning that it will not, at least for now, support government-issued currencies.  The company explained:  ""[The] cryptocurrency exchange BITBOX is launching as part of LINE's financial services business, providing services globally except in Japan and the U.S. 30 or more cryptocurrencies can be exchanged in BITBOX, and it will support 15 languages excluding Japanese. BITBOX only allows the exchange of cryptocurrencies, and does not accept exchange between fiat money and cryptocurrencies.""  Line's exchange will support bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ether and litecoin among a list of ""30 or more currencies"" that the company said were chosen ""through a rigorous review by a listing committee composed of experts.""  The move comes months after Line launched a new company dedicated to crypto services, indicating at the time that it was eyeing an exchange launch.  Its decision to exclude Japan suggests that its effort to obtain a license from Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) is still ongoing, given that it disclosed its application back in January.  ""The application process for registration as a virtual currency exchanger has already been started with the Financial Services Agency [FSA], and it is currently under review,"" Line said in a statement at the time.

The platform announced Thursday that Bittrex co-founder Bill Shihara will sit on its advisory board in a move aimed to improve the accessibility and security of its UnikoinGold token.      Unikrn co-founder Rahul Sood told CoinDesk that Shihara will also guide the company more generally as it seeks to expand its UnikoinGold network. In order to accomplish that, however, the company needs to encourage adoption.      He explained:      ""Unikrn is working aggressively to make UnikoinGold much easier for customers to access and use – because quite frankly it's still too hard – as we are looking to the future of security tokens; all of which Bill can help us with in a number of ways.""              Shihara echoed the sentiment, telling CoinDesk that Unikrn is ""in it for the long-haul,"" and recognizes that ""evolving and improving their offering will also help support the long-term outlook for the overall token ecosystem.""      ""The gaming industry is extremely popular around the world, and it's exciting to see blockchain projects with inventive use cases targeting popular industries,"" he said. ""This is the type of innovation that can really help drive interest and blockchain adoption globally.""      Perhaps more significant, however, is the fact that Unikrn is already operating under existing federal regulations within the U.S., Shihara said.      Sood noted that the firm is already in compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that sports betting within individual states is legal means the company may soon expand its reach.      ""Unikrn has been expecting a change in the U.S. for years, and we have a substantial U.S. presence,"" he said, adding that the company has a team based out of Las Vegas.      ""That gives us a significant advantage when it comes to expanding our sportsbook into individual states as laws change,"" he added. ""By August you'll see Unikrn launch across multiple global markets with various types of esports betting using both fiat and cryptocurrency.""

Based on the official judgement obtained and published by a local law firm, the Hangzhou Internet Court decided that the use of blockchain technology in evidence deposition can be legally viable on a case-by-case basis.  The judge commented:  ""The court thinks it should maintain an open and neutral stance on using blockchain to analyze individual cases. We can't exclude it just because it's a complex technology. Nor can we lower the standard just because it is tamper-proof and traceable. ... In this case, the usage of a third-party blockchain platform that is reliable without conflict of interests provides the legal ground for proving the intellectual infringement.""  According to data from the court, the case was filed in January by Huatai Yimei, a Hangzhou-based media company, against a Shenzhen-based technology firm for copyright infringement.  During the legal procedure, the plaintiff showed screen-captured images of web pages and text that it considered unauthorized usage by the Shenzhen company. Previously, Huatai Yimei had encoded the images, website sources codes and other evidence through a third-party site named baoquan.com – a blockchain-based evidence deposition platform – and attempted to use that evidence in the proceedings.  A primary question in the case, according to the judgement, had been whether blockchain can be used as a legal method to determine the authenticity of an item of evidence, similarly to a traditional notarization service.  According to the judgement, Baoquan uses the bitcoin and factom blockchains to hash provided content and store it on a distributed network.  Even if the disputed media assets should be taken down at a later stage, the court decided that evidence stored on the blockchain is sufficient to be legally accepted by the court. As such, the judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff.  The decision marks one of the first officially sanctioned use cases for blockchain in legal proceedings.  Formally incorporated in August 2017, the Hangzhou Internet Court is one of the first in China that processes cases purely through the web and has a responsibility to rule on disputes over internet-related intellectual property.  According to the court's website, it has also launched a dedicated e-evidence platform that offers access to both traditional notarization services and authorized third parties, including blockchain-based evidence deposition platforms.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, Bithumb, one of the largest crypto exchanges in South Korea and the world by trading volume, was hacked on June 20 – an event that saw 35 billion Korean won ($31 million) in various cryptocurrencies stolen.  The company published a progress update on Thursday, claiming that it has now reduced that damage to 19 billion won ($17 million) after collaborating with worldwide exchanges to retrieve some of the funds, as well as to try and prevent further losses.  In today's update, Bithumb also disclosed for the first time that 11 crypto assets were stolen during the breach. Notably, bitcoin accounted for the largest loss, with 2,016 BTC taken – an amount worth $12 million at press time.  Other major cryptocurrency losses include 2,219 ether, 692 bitcoin cash and 5.2 million XRP, worth around $950,000, $487,000 and $2.4 million, respectively, based on the latest price data from CoinDesk. The remainder comprised of lesser known cryptocurrencies, including significant amounts of aelf, golem and kyber network tokens.  The exchange further explained that the incident is still not yet fully concluded and, as such, it will continue its suspension of asset deposits and withdrawals on the platform.

42429281,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Nh,1530180022,Bitcoin Price Defends $6K as Traders Go Long,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price charts remain biased to the bears, but market positioning on a major exchange suggests a sustained break below $6,000 may remain elusive in short-term.  At press time, the leading cryptocurrency is trading at $6,100 on Bitfinex, largely unchanged on a 24-hour basis, and technically speaking, BTC remains on the defensive as discussed yesterday.  Further, the cryptocurrency markets will likely remain risk averse as the sell-off in ETH/BTC – the risk barometer of the cryptocurrency markets – is seen gathering pace in the next 24 hours.  So, going by the technicals alone, it seems safe to say that BTC is likely to find acceptance below the February low of $6,000 soon.  However, activity on Bitfinex, the fourth biggest cryptocurrency exchange by 24-hour trading volume, shows that BTC/USD shorts have been getting liquidated in recent days, while investors have been loading up on BTC/USD longs, creating upward pressure on price.  Thus, there is merit in the bears being cautious, as a corrective rally can't be ruled out.  Daily chart  The falling channel and downward sloping Bollinger Bands (standard deviation of +2, -2 on 20-day moving average) indicate that the bear grip on bitcoin is still intact.  The Chaikin money flow (CMF), an oscillator that measures buying and selling pressure, remains below zero, indicating strong selling pressure.  The longer the CMF remains the remains in a zone (either above zero or below zero) the more consistent the sentiment. In BTC's case, bearish sentiment is quite strong as the CMF has been hovering in the negative territory for the fifth consecutive week.  BTC could well close (as per UTC) below $6,000 (February low) in the next day or two, and maybe extend the decline from the May high of $9,990 towards $5,000 in the next few weeks.  BTC/USD longs rising  As mentioned above, BTC/USD longs on Bitfinex have increased by 16.5 percent since June 17, as seen in the chart above. This likely indicates that bargain hunters are finding BTC undervalued around $6,000 – unsurprising, perhaps, as the cryptocurrency is down 70 percent from the all-time record high of almost $20,000 in December.  BTC/USD shorts dropping  BTC/USD shorts have dropped 25 percent since Sunday. Interestingly, the charts saw a long-legged doji candle on the same day, indicating bearish exhaustion. Both are factors that may have helped BTC's defense of $6,000 amid the bearish technical setup.  View  While the technical outlook is bearish, we are unable to rule out a corrective rally above the immediate resistance of $6,425, courtesy of the bullish market positioning seen on Bitfinex.  The conflicting signals force us to call a neutral market.  A daily close (as per UTC) below $6,000 (February low) would boost the odds of a drop to falling channel support, currently seen at $5,300.  On the higher side, a convincing move above $6,425 (April 1 low) would add credence to signs of a short-term bullish turnaround seen earlier this week and would open the doors to a stronger corrective rally towards $7,000.

42429279,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Hh,1530172836,A Plan to Send Millions in Bitcoin to Venezuela Is Moving Ahead,"Developer Jonathan Wheeler is at an impasse of sorts.  The former bank employee turned developer doesn't want to say too much about his newest project, an effort he believes could soon help people living under one of the world's most oppressive monetary regimes. That's because he needs others to help him with his mission – getting bitcoin in the hands of Venezuelan citizens by way of a massive mobile airdrop.  The problem is that spilling too much intel could put those he's working with in danger.  The Venezuela government routinely arrests people with deviating political opinions and has even gone as far as to ban technologies citizens have used to circumvent its censorship. That's not to mention the fact that Venezuela's government has already launched its own cryptocurrency, the petro, which it's painted as key to its economic revival.  Still, Wheeler is set on ditching efforts to try and help the country by way of political change. Instead, he wants to use bitcoin to quell an economic crisis so severe people are finding it difficult to pay for necessities (food is in such short supply, in fact, the majority of the population is losing weight).  And he's eager to share that the project is no longer just a lofty ambition sketched out on Medium, but that it has some legs – supporting a growing team developing a mobile app called Azul, which he hopes, by the end of the year, will be enough to draw millions in donations.  Wheeler told CoinDesk:  ""To give it the greatest likelihood of success, it has to be done en masse. We're trying to make this a large-scale collaborative mission to help people suffering from financial tyranny.""  He admits its a daring (maybe even crazy) idea, but it's one he's so determined about that he left his job at Goldman Sachs in February.  After that, he commandeered the help of Morgan Crena, and together they formed a non-profit called Pale Blue Foundation – a ""hat tip"" to Wheeler's personal hero, the astronomer Carl Sagan, who wrote a famous blurb about how space makes everything on Earth look so insignificant.  ""To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known,"" Sagan wrote in a famous 1990 speech.  With that mantra, they decided to take matters into their own hands.  ""Let's pull away from society for a bit and see what we can do,"" Crena said.  Usability challenge  A few months later, the project is now a team of 15, including several Venezuelan citizens.  Still, cryptocurrency communities, including zcash and dash, have long been trying to help Venezuela in some way. The efforts are early, but so far, they've been to little avail.  Wheeler and Crena, however, argue that this boils down to a lack of focus on usability. The Pale Blue Foundation is in discussions with a number of bitcoin companies to help them with their goal, including OpenBazaar and LocalBitcoins. And of all the blockchains out there, they chose bitcoin because they believe it has the best ability to be widely available and handle the most transactions.  ""We're focused on bitcoin because we think it's the most viable solution with the most worldwide potential,"" Wheeler said.  ""Bitcoin's built like a tank,"" Crena argued.  To the duo, that's especially true now that bitcoin has the lightning network – a layer-two technology expected to help the cryptocurrency scale by pushing transactions off-chain.  Lightning network, which is now in beta, is a key part of the technical design for the Azul app, Wheeler said. To that end, Pale Blue Foundation is in discussions with lightning developers, including those leading development of the lightning wallet CoinClip and the startup ACINQ, which is working on its own lightning implementation.  Pale Blue Foundation also has an active and growing group of code contributors, including Quentin Vidal, a developer who recently graduated from Jimmy Song's intensive Programming Blockchain Workshop. This is important, those in support of the effort say, because Venezuelans that have very limited resources aren't going to have devices for running very sophisticated or large software.  Wheeler argued:  ""It's the people who don't have those fancy phones that need bitcoin.""  Plus is brainstorming with the Venezuelans on the Pale Blue Foundation team, Wheeler realized one of the major pain points to bitcoin adoption among those citizens is that it's generally so difficult to use. As such, that's something the team is specifically addressing with Azul.  ""People don't have a leisurely weekend to learn how to use bitcoin,"" Wheeler said.  Buying bitcoin  Still, the research they've done goes further than that.  Wheeler and Crena are looking to strike up partnerships with the Human Rights Foundation and the United Nations as well. They've even been talking to economists to find out what some of the unintended consequences of dropping a load a new online currency across a country with a damaged economy might be.  But even as they make these connections, they're eager to get the app up and running to test the concept.  And then after that, it's all about securing the funding that'll buy the bitcoin to be airdropped to Venezuelans.  Wheeler's original pitch, presented at the BitDev meetup in New York City in February, was to raise millions of dollars from venture capitalists. But as he and Crena have pitched investors, several have pressured them to launch a crypto token of their own through an initial coin offering (ICO).  According to Wheeler, the VCs said that with the market for crypto tokens so hot right now, he and his team would be able to raise much more money.  But Wheeler and Crena decided against this.  At this stage, they're looking for donors to the cause, with ambitions of maybe one day going beyond Venezuela to help other countries facing humanitarian crises.  Speaking to their initial focus on Venezuela, though, Wheeler concluded:  ""We've got to start somewhere.""

Titled ""The Study of Development and Regulations on Distributed Ledger Accounts, Blockchain and Digital Currency"" and authored by researchers from the CBRC – Li Wenhong and Jiang Zeshen – the working paper was published Wednesday.  Fully dedicated to regulatory studies on cryptocurrency, the paper summarizes a variety of legal efforts made by different jurisdictions to govern activities related to cryptocurrency derivative trading, as well as ICOs.  The paper reads:  ""Currently, any capital transaction that relates to distributed ledger accounts, blockchain, cryptocurrency and its derivatives, ICOs and exchange operations should all be regarded as financial services. Therefore they must be put under relevant financial regulatory frameworks so that they can operate legally with a license.""  Although the paper indicates that comments made by researchers don't necessarily represent the views of the regulator itself, the suggestion is still notable given it marks the first time that Chinese regulators have advocated for a cryptocurrency licensing scheme such has been adopted in the U.S.  In addition, the paper suggests a potential framework for crypto-related activities should not be limited to just ICOs and trading. Rather, it should apply to any service that deals with transactions ""related to distributed ledger accounts.""  As previously reported by CoinDesk, the clampdown from the People's Bank of China along with six other regulators – including the CBRC – last year stated that ICOs and fiat-to-crypto trading are prohibited because they were unlicensed financial activities. Since then, though, the regulators have not indicated whether or how they may consider a licensing framework for cryptocurrency activities.

42429275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Dh,1530158447,Decentralizing Popular Dapps Isn't Just a Scaling Problem,"It's no secret that building large-scale, fully decentralized applications is a challenge, but it turns out the hurdles have to do with more than just scaling.  Decentralized application or ""dapp"" developers frequently hit roadblocks, since ethereum – the go-to platform so far in dapps' short history – can process only around 25 transactions per second, and the more transactions the network is asked to handle, the more each one costs the user. These limitations on transaction throughput are commonly referred to as ""scaling"" limitations, and everyone from the casual dapp user to ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin is keenly aware of them.  So when a particular dapp turns out to be less-than-totally decentralized, with parts of the software running on centralized servers, say, the solution seems obvious – speed up transaction throughput and reduce costs, and pure, blissful decentralization will naturally follow.  Turns out, though, things aren't that simple.  Some of the most popular dapps that currently live on ethereum – which right now fall into two categories, games and exchanges – often retain centralized features, but the reasons have little to do with throughput and instead, revolve around user experience.  Take games – for developers to be able to make updates to a blockchain-based game, they typically put backdoors into the smart contracts.  Otherwise, said James Duffy, a co-founder of Loom Network, which develops ethereum-based dapps including a Q&A site called DelegateCall, developers would only be able to deploy their dapp once and never be able to modify it.  ""Obviously if you're a player in the game you want the developers to be able to update it. You want them to be able to fix bugs, add new levels, add new features,"" Duffy said.  On the other hand, decentralized exchanges (DEX) keep some centralization in their processes as it relates to their order books. The reasons for this approach have to do partly with security and partly with the difficulty of assembling a single, reliable order book across a large, distributed network of computers.  And while most of these dapp projects aim to decentralize further in the future, for now, they're happy to work slowly through that process so that users have the best experience and don't lose money.  Duffy told CoinDesk:  ""No one's ever built a complicated app and then launched it and it just worked perfectly on day one.""  The back door dilemma  CryptoKitties was the first decentralized application to gain widespread attention and a significant userbase.  It didn't take long, however, for critics to notice that the game is not as decentralized as it initially seemed. Another Loom Network co-founder, Luke Zhang, wrote about the backdoors in the CryptoKitties code, which allows the company behind the game to pause it entirely or alter its closed-source breeding algorithm.  While the CryptoKitties team contends that keeping the breeding algorithm a secret makes the game more fun, this choice does mean users have to trust the company itself not to tweak the algorithm in a way that would undermine the market's pricing of kitties (some of which are very rare and in turn very expensive).  Another piece of the Cryptokitties game that was under the company's control, until very recently, was the art assets.  Without these, a player would still own that kitty they paid 250 ether for, but instead of being able to admire its green eyes and Himalayan, orange soda-colored fur, they'd have to admire the number sequence encoded in the non-fungible token that's at the core of the game: 99ac5586a447g9gg44665775ddf71444488773384ccccdffc.  Cute, right?  But according to Duffy, without this centralized control of the art, developers and players might abuse the privilege.  ""What happens if someone uploads something illegal, like child pornography or something?"" he said. ""The nodes would have to have a way of censoring that to remove that data, or it would just be a complete free-for-all.""  And yet, CryptoKitties seems to be ready to take somewhat of a chance on this – on June 26 the company, now known as Axiom Zen, announced that it had updated its terms of service, making it possible for third-party applications to use CryptoKitties art. And not only that but it was open-sourcing the ownership rights of the non-fungible tokens.  Still, it's a far cry from complete decentralization, and Duffy acknowledged that there are potential pitfalls in CryptoKitties' approach to its business model. But he said that launching a semi-centralized dapp and decentralizing it over time is ""pragmatic.""  Kyle Samani, the managing partner of Multicoin Capital, echoed Duffy's statements, saying, ""Decentralization is generally a spectrum."" He called criticism of CryptoKitties' centralized aspects ""nit-picky.""  Duffy held out hope for more complete decentralization, though.  For instance, he argues that Loom Network's approach – building a dedicated, scalable sidechain for each dapp and pegging that chain to ethereum – would enable full decentralization without having to settle for fossilized games that never add new levels or features. Updates could be made through hard forks, assuming players could come to a collective agreement.  Making a prediction, Duffy said:  ""We're going to see actual, real, fun games that are normal games that people want to play, except that they're actually owning the in-game assets and they can do this on a fully decentralized platform.""  Order book blues  Centralized exchanges have been cryptocurrencies' Achilles' heel since the early days of bitcoin – MtGox being the most famous example of what can go wrong when transparent, decentralized ledgers meet opaque, centralized intermediaries.  For this reason, advocates of decentralization have long tried to build distributed alternatives. Examples on ethereum include Idex and ForkDelta, which according to DappRadar are the first- and second-most trafficked dapps over the past 24 hours.  The only problem is that both of these exchanges use centralized order books, as do most of their peers, according to Taariq Lewis, a veteran cryptocurrency developer who is building DEX technology – codenamed Lyra Protocols for now.  These centralized order books, which collect ""bids"" (prices offered by buyers) and ""asks"" (prices offered by sellers) to facilitate trades, are the norm in traditional markets.  Despite strict regulation, however, shenanigans abound on traditional exchanges. Spoofing, front-running and layering are just a few of the (illegal) tricks traders use to take advantage of each other, and this behavior is prevalent – if not worse – on crypto exchanges.  ""Unregulated centralized order books are manipulation havens,"" said Lewis.  A person familiar with DEX operations, who asked not to be named, added that some exchanges see order book decentralization as a way to avoid regulatory interventions. Exchanges operating centralized order books must either register as Alternative Trading Systems or avoid listing securities – which, as is becoming increasingly clear, many crypto tokens are.  Decentralizing order books, however, is anything but simple. Traders need a main order book that is visible to everyone, Lewis said, and ensuring that everyone sees the same bids and asks without a central intermediary is ""an unsolved problem.""  He continued, ""It's not trivial. A lot of these things folks have been working on for decades, well before blockchain.""  Adding to these technical difficulties, Lewis said, decentralized order books can be easy targets for Sybil attacks – whereby one user or group of users creates hundreds if not thousands of identities in an effort to spam the network with information.  Still, exchanges such as Idex and ForkDelta have said they plan to decentralize their order books when the technology enables them to.  Lewis did not want to reveal too much about Lyra Protocols, but said the project was ""looking into"" attack-resistant, distributed order books. And Duffy said that a number of DEXs have reached out to Loom Network wanting to take advantage of dedicated sidechains for the purpose of decentralizing more of their processes.  As such, Duffy expressed confidence, saying:  ""Give it a couple years and I'd say it'll definitely be the case, just because it's possible and if users demand it, then someone's going to fill that demand.""

42429280,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx7Jh,1530154840,US Judge Says Boxer-Backed ICO Token Is a Security,"A Florida district court has published an analysis explaining how a crypto token is a security.  Magistrate judge Andrea Simonton of the Southern District of Florida, in a report on whether to freeze the assets of the Floyd Mayweather-endorsed Centra Tech crypto startup, released a detailed explanation of how the company's token demonstrates the different aspects of a security under existing law. While it may not be a precedent for other similar court cases, the report may be cited in other legal battles asking whether crypto tokens are securities or not.  The defendants notably are not challenging the assertion that Centra's CTR token is a security, according to the document. Unlike the case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, this decision is part of a lawsuit filed by previous investors claiming they lost money due to the unregistered securities sale.  As CoinDesk previously reported, the startups co-founders have all been indicted on various securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy charges. Part of the case revolves around the idea that the CTR token, which Centra Tech sold to investors, is a security.  The court, quoting from the Howey Rule, said it believes that the token satisfies all three prongs of what defines an ""investment contract,"" and is therefore a security. The three prongs include the facts that the investment in an asset, investors can benefit financially from the company's success and the success or failure of Centra Tech was entirely dependent on its founders' efforts.  The judge explains:  ""Because the success of Centra Tech and the Centra Debit Card, CTR Tokens, and cBay that it purported to develop was entirely dependent on the efforts and actions of the Defendants, the third prong is satisfied. Therefore, the offering of Centra Tokens was an investment contract under the Securities Act, such that the Defendants sold or offered to sell securities by virtue of the Centra Tech ICO.""  Stephen Palley, a lawyer with expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrency matters, said in a tweet that though this decision is not a binding precedent for other courts, ""it's what lawyers call 'persuasive authority' and pithy enough to be easily quoted in other opinions.""

42429267,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLx6zh,1530151524,FBI Agent Estimates 130 Crypto Investigations Underway,"The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently running 130 different cryptocurrency-related investigations, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.  FBI Supervisory Special Agent Kyle Armstrong told the Crypto Evolved conference in New York that the agency is investigating a variety of crimes, including human trafficking, drug transactions, kidnapping and ransomware, which have a cryptocurrency component, according to Bloomberg.  Further, there has recently been an uptick in cases involving cryptocurrencies, he said, citing opioids as one area where the bureau needs to focus on. Roughly 10 percent of drug users worldwide purchase drugs online in illegal digital marketplaces.  Some parts of the U.S. have also seen an increase in extortion schemes, where the perpetrators wish to use cryptocurrencies.  That being said, these ""threat-tagged"" investigations only make up a ""small sliver"" of the thousands of cases the agency has, he said.  And unlike crimes involving cash, Armstrong said the blockchain's immutability makes it easier to track transactions. On the flip side, cryptocurrencies' anonymity or pseudonymity make it more difficult to properly investigate a crime.
