On its Security and Intelligence Blog, the company outlined how CoinHive – a JavaScript program that works in the background of a website and uses a computer's processing power to mine monero – was distributed by attackers who appropriated Google's DoubleClick. Significantly, miners like CoinHive operate without a user's consent or knowledge.  Google's DoubleClick ad services are also used by YouTube, the world's most popular video sharing service, and the miner impacted a number of users on the site, according to ArsTechnica.  A ""separate web miner that connects to a private pool"" was also involved in the scheme, according to TrendMicro's report.  The ""malvertisement"" incorporated two different web miner scripts in addition to the actual advertisement, according to the report.  It continued:  ""The affected webpage will show the legitimate advertisement while the two web miners covertly perform their task. We speculate that the attackers’ use of these advertisements on legitimate websites is a ploy to target a larger number of users, in comparison to only that of compromised devices. The traffic involving the abovementioned cryptocurrency miners has since decreased after January 24"".  As much as 80 percent of an affected computer's processing power can be taken over when exposed, reducing the machine's performance, according to the report.  Clandestine cryptocurrency mining has been on the rise in recent months, as previously reported. Companies such as oil pipeline giant Transneft have seen their systems affected by the malware, and a report from November suggested that CoinHive has become one of the more common pieces of malware in circulation today.

42428477,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL8H9h,1517259645,WEF Trials Blockchain in Bid to Boost Air Travel Security,"The World Economic Forum (WEF) is working with the Canadian and Dutch governments to pilot a digital identity project that focuses in part on blockchain.  The Known Traveller Digital Identity initiative is aimed at using technologies like blockchain and biometrics to improve the security around international air travel. A prototype, developed in collaboration with professional services firm Accenture, was unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.  The idea behind the concept is to provide travelers with greater control over their identifying information by eliminating the need for a central database. Rather, travelers would rely on a ""permission-based distributed ledger"" that would allow for the transfer of information about a traveler's background and where they've gone to, for example.  The WEF claims that the ledger's use, if fully realized, would ""enable pre-screening and facilitation fo compliant known travelers across borders."" At the same time, that would potentially free up resources for other purposes.  According to the group, an ever-swelling number of travelers – international travel is expected to climb to 1.8 billion people annually by 2013, per figures cited by the WEF – underlies the need for more efficient processes.  John Moavenzadeh, a member of the WEF's Executive Committee, said in a statement:  ""With travellers providing access to verified personal biometric, biographic and historical travel data at their discretion, they can assist authorities to undertake risk assessments and pre-screening in advance: essentially verifying their identities and providing secure and seamless movement throughout their journey using biometric recognition technology.""  According to a report that summarizes the project, it has not yet been decided whether or not the personal data will be stored on the blockchain directly.

Bloomberg, citing a source with knowledge of the process, reported Monday that the firm – which launched in 2016 with the backing of major investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures – is looking to raise as much as C$400 million, or about $324 million, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.  But in an email to CoinDesk, Polychain principal and venture partner Ryan Zurrer pushed back against the report.  ""This article is false. We are not planning an IPO in Canada and have not made any engagements to this effect,"" he wrote. The firm added that it isn't seeking an IPO in general.  If the listing were to take place, it would mark a significant development in the growing ecosystem of cryptocurrency hedge funds, which have positioned themselves to invest in the market for cryptographic assets. As many as a hundred or more have set up shop in order to pursue potential opportunities, according to reports from last year.

Twin filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dated Jan. 25 and 26 show that co-founders Tim Lewkow and Eli Lang are seeking funds to back Fractal Investments, which invests in crypto-assets, per its official website. The company dates back to last summer and has maintained a public profile primarily through its Twitter account.  Lang is formerly creative director for Ripple, having begun working for the San Francisco-based startup in 2012. Lewkow worked for Ripple from December 2013 until June of last year, most recently serving as integration engineering manager, according to his LinkedIn account.  The filings detail two vehicles, Fractal: Virtual Currency Investment Fund I LP and Fractal: Private Investment Fund LP, both of which are incorporated in Delaware. Neither filings indicate how much money is being raised for either entity.  The developments perhaps highlight the continued drive to establish hedge funds and other financial entities amidst a period of heightened activity in cryptocurrency markets and development around the tech more broadly.

The regulation, which will cover issuance and registration of cryptocurrencies, is expected to be finalized this year, said Emilio Aquino, SEC commissioner in charge of enforcement and investor protection, according to Reuters.  Aquino stated at a press conference:  ""We want to come up with our own set of regulations. You have to be extra careful how investors in this new space are protected.""  Aquino further said that the regulations are expected to be finalized this year and will include the issuance and registration of cryptocurrencies. Guidelines on cybersecurity of cryptocurrency markets and investors' financial literacy and eligibility are expected to be included in the regulation.  ""Unfortunately, there have been a lot of cases where ICO promoters vanish into thin air. We don't want that to happen here,"" Aquino stated.  Local news source Philstar Global also suggested that ICOs may have to register with the SEC since it considers cryptocurrencies to be securities.  Earlier this month, the SEC warned the public to take the necessary precautions in dealing with ICOs, and also filed a cease-and-desist order against four companies and an ICO operator citing securities registration regulations.  Elsewhere, Chinese authorities outlawed ICOs last September, saying they were illegal under domestic law.  ""It is a kind of non-approved illegal open fund-raising behavior, suspected of illegal sale tokens, illegal securities issuance and illegal fund-raising, financial fraud, pyramid schemes and other criminal activities,"" a joint statement read at the time.

42400961,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTSZ,1517237113,Ethereum Is Quietly Closing In on Record Price Highs,"Ethereum's ether token could revisit record highs very soon, courtesy of last week's bullish price action, the price charts suggest.  The cryptocurrency, which was notably given a higher rating than bitcoin and Ripple's XRP last week by Florida-based Weiss Ratings, is up 18 percent week-on-week, says data source OnChainFX. As of writing, ether (ETH) is changing hands at $1,211.  Having bottomed out at $905 last Tuesday, the price of ETH rose to a 12-day high of $1,224 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange – a rebound that left a higher low (bullish set up) on the price chart.  Furthermore, previous day's 12 percent rise (UTC) was backed by a 78 percent jump in trading volumes, shows CoinMarketCap. A high-volume rally indicates strong hands are at play.  Notably, prices on South Korean exchanges are again being used in the calculation of global average by CoinMarketCap, having been removed in early January with no announcement and causing a drop in global prices.  Thus, ETH might have received a slight boost, with prices in South Korea still carrying a premium of approximately $70 over those on western exchanges. However, the Korean price premium has dropped sharply from the heady heights seen at the turn of the year.  So, the price rise appears to be more or less legitimate. Looking at the charts, ETH witnessed a bull reversal yesterday and could soon revisit record highs above $1,400.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows:  ETH bottomed out around $927.29 (38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of July to January rally).  The higher lows pattern, as indicated by the rising trendline, indicates the bulls are in a dominant position.  On Sunday, ETH closed (as per UTC) well above $1,166 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of 13 to Jan. 17 sell-off).  The 5-day MA and 10-day MA trend northwards, marking a bullish setup.  A close above 61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement indicates a bull reversal – i.e. the previous trend (bull run) has resumed. So, the drop to $1,150 seen today could be transient.  View  ETH could revisit record highs above $1,400 in the short-run if the bulls defend the rising trendline support over the next couple of days.  In the larger scheme of things, only a daily close (as per UTC) below $905 (Jan. 23 low) would revive the bearish outlook.

42400945,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTCp,1517232613,Kansas Latest US State to Warn on Crypto Investment Risk,"The securities commissioner of the U.S. state of Kansas has issued a warning on the risks of cryptocurrency and ICO investments.  On Jan. 25, the Office of Securities Commissioner – a division of the Kansas Insurance Department – issuedhttp://ksc.ks.gov/DocumentCenter/View/420 a statement to the public that investment in cryptocurrencies, including initial coin offerings (ICOs) and futures tied to digital currencies, are not insured by the government.  As such, the commissioner warns investors to be cautious regarding investment pitfalls.  John Wine, the state's securities commissioner, said:  ""Investors should go beyond the headlines and hype to understand the risks associated with investments in cryptocurrencies, as well as cryptocurrency futures contracts and other financial products where these virtual currencies are linked in some way to the underlying investment.""  In addition, the State Insurance Department highlights that projects that give promises of high return, make unsolicited offers or pressure investors, are ""red flags"" of fraudulent schemes that investors should be aware of.  The statement, although not entirely surprising, once more signals that regulators in the U.S., at both state and federal levels, are paying closer attention to cryptocurrency activities, especially those that may be considered as issuing securities under disguise of token sales.

At law enforcement level, in addition to three recent lawsuits brought by the CFTC against cryptocurrency operators, state level government bodies such as Texas State Securities Board and Department of Banking have recently given cease-and-desist orders to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrency banking services, citing the violation of financial regulations.

42400948,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTJi,1517230828,In Their Own Words: Real Companies Talk Ripple XRP Pilots,"Just one – before this month, that's how many financial firms had publicly expressed interest in using Ripple's cryptocurrency, XRP.  Indeed, the blockchain startup has no lack of partners, from American Express to SEB, that use its xCurrent product, which allows financial institutions to send transactions in real-time without the innovative new crypto-asset. But it was only a little-known company (Mexico-based Cuallix) that had signed on to use Ripple's xRapid to leverage XRP for liquidity.  Flash forward to today, however, and the narrative has seen a shift.  In rapid-fire succession, three money transfer firms revealed they are piloting the use of XRP. First was remittance giant MoneyGram, then came Mercury FX (which conducts about $500 million in transaction volume per year) and finally telecom provider IDT.  To many, the news has been a vindication – not just for Ripple, but for the millions of mainstream investors that have embraced XRP as an alternative investment, helping it rise from mere cents early last year to nearly $4 this month.  And while it's still an open question as to whether such tests will go live, during the Blockchain Connect conference in San Francisco last week, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse framed the general skepticism as old-fashioned and out of touch.  Garlinghouse told attendees:  ""When I hear banks say, 'We’re not going to use digital assets,' I hear Randal Stevens say 'AT&T will never use IP.'""  Internal only  So far, the largest interested party in XRP is legacy money transmitter MoneyGram, which in addition to being valued at $700 million, has over 350,000 locations around the world at which customers can pick up cash.  However, the pilot does not directly serve any of those locations, according to a spokeswoman.  Instead, the pilot is focused on implementing XRP within Moneygram's internal corporate treasury transactions. In an email, she described an internal pilot for back-office functionality only.  ""MoneyGram is not using XRP in customer transactions,"" the spokeswoman told CoinDesk.  That might seem a bit strange, since a whopping 89 percent of Moneygram's revenue in 2016 was generated from its money transfer service, according to the company's most recent annual report, and XRP (and other cryptocurrencies) are widely targeted at cross-border money movement.  But while those potential XRP use cases aren't being tested yet within MoneyGram, Holmes said what the company learns from the internal pilot could someday inform much broader applications.  The spokeswoman said:  ""The goal is to investigate whether it is efficient in terms of time and cost and to see if it can be a viable addition to our FX trading.""  Consumer-facing  Perhaps more notably, London-based Mercury FX's interest in XRP is geared towards consumer-facing applications.  ""I imagine we will be able to begin using XRP for customer payments in the coming months,"" the founder and director of Mercury FX, Alastair Constance, told CoinDesk.  He continued, saying, ""As with all things, we will start with more modest sums in the thousands of dollars and increase by orders of magnitude from there. Come to the end of the pilot we will not be surprised if XRP is carrying single transactions across the blockchain of a million dollars or more.""  By far the most detailed pilot, the Mercury FX project will use xRapid to conduct payments for goods and services in China and Mexico, with the hope that it will expand to other emerging markets via partnerships with Ripple and other platforms.  While the software for the pilot is currently being integrated with Mercury FX, Constance said the pilot won't likely formally begin for two more months, before concluding about three months after that.  Not all of Mercury FX's nearly $500 million in annual transaction volume will be conducted with XRP anytime soon, though, as Constance said he's also exploring using some of Ripple's other blockchain products that don't require XRP.  ""Crypto is building into crypto from one side and fiat needs to build from the other side,"" he said. ""Ripple lets fiat companies like us do that.""  Use unknown  While XRP dropped from its nearly $4 highs, it's held relatively stable between $1 and $1.50.  Yet, it'll be interesting to see how news of new pilots and interest affect the price of the cryptocurrency, especially if new details about Cuallix's work and IDT's pilot are revealed.  IDT declined to comment for this report, other than to point to its existing statements, where Alfredo O'Hagan, SVP of IDT's consumer payments business said, ""We're excited to pilot Ripple's xRapid solution for on-demand liquidity. We expect that xRapid will enable us to settle more transactions in real-time and at a lower cost.""  Cuallix did not respond to inquiries before press time.  Of note also though, is another, newer use case for XRP – as venture capital.  Last week, online marketplace Omni revealed it had accepted a venture investment largely in XRP, which it plans to use in part to pay the bills — such as paying freelancers.  With all these new projects implementing XRP into the plan, no one is possibly more relieved than Ripple executives themselves, who had known of the interest, but had largely been unable to share it with the public.  Ripple's head of product, Asheesh Birla told CoinDesk:  ""We're pleased to be able to share how payment providers are implementing xRapid to improve their payments flows. Remember, we just built and launched xRapid late last summer. This is just the beginning.""  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.

Launched this weekend, according to a press release, one of the stores to receive the new service is based in Shinjuku, an area of Tokyo that attracts large numbers of foreign visitors. The other store is adjacent to Tokyo's main business district.  The company said:  ""In addition to diversifying [our services], we will implement initiatives to improve bitcoin recognition and usage promotion.""  With the launch of the bitcoin payment system, the company indicated it aims to respond to the diverse needs of its customers both in Japan and overseas. ""We believe that we can provide improved service and convenience,"" it said.  Yamada Denki has set the settlement limit of bitcoins equivalent to 300,000 Japanese yen ($2,760) per account. Bitcoin is trading around $11,200 (1,218,016 JPY) at the time of writing, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  The moves comes after another Japanese electronics retailer, Bic Camera, said last April that it will test a new point-of-sale system (PoS) that will allow customers to purchase goods with bitcoin, also in partnership with with bitFlyer. Later in July, the firm said that it is expanding a bitcoin payment option to all of its stores nationwide.  And, in August, Tokyo-based Marui, a department store chain, tested bitcoin payments at one of its locations in Shinjuku. The trial set a cap of ¥100,000 (about $900) on bitcoin transactions.

42400962,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTTY,1517226341,Bitcoin Price Looking Heavy As News Turns Negative,"Bitcoin's possible upside appears capped by a recent run of negative news.  Following a hack against the exchange Coincheck last week, CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) turned lower from $11,942 (Sunday high), ultimately hitting a low of $11,110 at 09:59 UTC Monday. Still, what may be more notable is not the recent price (which continues its sideways 2018 trajectory), but the changing narrative for potential buyers.  Though the Coincheck news did not impact bitcoin directly (no bitcoin was stolen), it does appear to have marked a change in a mainstream news narrative that has breathlessly provided tailwinds for the market since late last year.  For example, the 6.9 percent drop from the high of $11,492 may be due to concerns regarding the solvency of a startup called Tether, which provides a proxy cryptocurrency used by exchanges in lieu of the U.S. dollar.  While bloggers have long accused Tether of creating the asset out of thin air, news reports are now speculating doomsday scenarios following a CoinDesk report that suggests the startup has broken ties with an auditor acquired to calm market fears.  In the press, experts have been quoted as saying that bitcoin (BTC) price could crash 80 percent if it turns out Tether is fraudulent. And though that scenario doesn't appear likely, coupled with chart analysis, it does perhaps increase the odds of a break below $10,000.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $11,064 on Coinbase's GDAX exchange. The cryptocurrency has depreciated by 1 percent in the last 24 hours, says data source OnChinaFX.  Bitcoin 4-hour chart  The above chart (prices as per Coinbase) shows-  Failed bullish breakout - BTC's failure to cut through resistance at $11,690, despite the upside break of the symmetrical triangle on Friday could end up strengthening the bears.  Currently, prices are threatening to drop below the rising trendline support.  50-MA, 100-MA and 200-MA are sloping downwards in favor the bears.  View  A break below the rising trendline would open doors for $10,000 and possibly extend the drop to $9,000.  As discussed in the previous update, dips below the $10,000 mark are to be viewed with caution.  On the higher side, only a move above $11,690 could yield a sustained rally to $13,000.

The intrusion, which was revealed Friday after the exchange had abruptly ceased most services, saw the theft of about 500 million XEM – the token of the NEM network – worth roughly $420 million at the time.  According to the latest update from Coincheck, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) has ordered the exchange to launch an investigation into its security vulnerabilities that led to the hack, and to submit a report for management improvement to the authority by Feb. 13. The FSA said the firm is also required to report details regarding the facts and causes of the issue.  According to a report from Nikkei today, the authority announced the order during a press conference, saying, ""Inappropriate management of system risks had become the norm at Coincheck."" That sloppiness led to a loss even larger than that stolen in the notable Mt. Gox hack.  Nikkei also indicated that the agency is expanding its investigations, including on-site inspections at other cryptocurrency exchanges in the country to prevent a reoccurrence of the issue.  In an earlier statement issued to CoinDesk, the NEM.io Foundation also suggested a lack of security precautions at Coincheck may have resulted in the hack.  ""We would advise all exchanges to make use of our multi-signature smart contract which is among the best in the landscape. Coincheck didn't use them and that's why they could have been hacked. They were very relaxed with their security measure."" said Lon Wong, president of the foundation.  Over the weekend, Coincheck also issued a statement stating that the exchange will compensate the exchange's 260,000 NEM holders who lost funds, although no detailed plan for repayment has yet been released.

42400947,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTLg,1517220156,Texas Halts Crypto Banking Operation over Regulatory Violations,"Texas financial authorities are increasing their regulatory scrutiny over activities related to cryptocurrency.  According to a press release issued Jan. 26, the Texas Department of Banking said its cease-and-desist order issued to cryptocurrency banking platform AriseBank has taken effect, barring its services in the state.  The department's banking commissioner Charles​ ​G.​ ​Cooper, said the firm has been promoting and offering banking services while not chartered or authorized to engage in banking in the state, and is ""not supervised by or registered with any Texas or federal regulatory agency.""  The order said the company has violated the Texas Finance Code Chapter 31 and thus AriseBank is required to ""cease and desist from implying that they engage in the business of banking in Texas"" and to clarify that it will not offer services to Texas residents.  According to the original order that, issued on Jan. 5, AriseBank had 21 days to appeal. Yet, since no submission was received, the department said the order is final and non-appealable.  During an interview with the podcast Coast to Coast AM on Jan. 27, AriseBank's co-founder and CEO Jared Rice, Sr. said the Securities Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a raid on the company's office on Friday Jan. 26. According to Rice, AriseBank's asset and funds raised from initial coin offerings were seized by the law enforcement.  While the website of AriseBank is currently unavailable, a previous press release and historic data captured by Archive.org shows that the firm touts a ""decentralized banking platform"" that includes storage, exchange and payment services, as well as Visa cards linked to crypto accounts.  The website also promoted Evander Holyfield, the former professional U.S boxer, as its ""official AriseBank endorser."" As of press time, Holyfield could not be reached for comments.  In its press release – dated Jan. 25, just one day before the appeal deadline – AriseBank said that, since the company adopts a decentralized model and does not hold user's funds at custody, ""it is wholly unnecessary for the platform to be FDIC regulated or insured.""  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is the U.S. federal agency that insures deposits and oversees financial institutions for consumer protection.  And yet, according to the same announcement, AriseBank was in the process of acquiring two FDIC-insured banks – KFMC Bank Holding Company and TPMG. Although AriseBank claims the two entities are well established with decades of history, little information about either KFMC or TPMG could be found online.  In addition, the while the new order did not specifically target AriseBank's recent ICO activity, it appears that the company's token sale is still affected, as the ICO website is also not currently available. According to another release from Jan. 18, the platform said it raised $600 million within weeks around the end of 2017, and netted $500 million in the public token sale.  Email inquiries sent to AriseBank and Rice, Sr. were not responded to, as of press time.  The action by the Department of Banking is the latest effort by Texas authorities to scrutinize services or products that pertain to cryptocurrency.  Previously, the state has also issued a cease-and-desist order to a scheduled initial coin offering (ICO) by BitConnect, which was followed by the platform's notable shut down.

42400941,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTDo,1517216576,A Little Lightning Project Has Two Big Implications,"How will the Lightning Network change bitcoin?  Although it might be too soon to know, it's a question everyone's seemingly asking following tests that take the long-anticipated tech closer to launch. The network's garnered its fair share of excitement over the past few months, so much so that individuals and businesses are looking to take advantage of its cheap, fast payments.  Out of this comes a small Japanese startup called Nayuta, which has been experimenting with adding Lightning payments to the Internet of Things, where everything from door locks to BMWs are connected to the internet to increase efficiency.  With this experimentation, Nayuta is exploring a couple of implications of the tech.  First, the startup believes Lightning could bring value to the Internet of Things in a way that old payment systems and bitcoin couldn't because they're both simply too slow.  Second, it's one of the first earnest businesses working on a product built on Lightning, showing that the off-chain network might actually have a business proposition, even this early on.  Lightning + IoT  Nayuta started off in 2015 by adding normal bitcoin transactions to the Internet of Things in a range of prototypes.  But, like others using bitcoin, they were disappointed by its limitations. They found instant ""zero-confirmation"" transactions weren't secure enough and that 10 minutes was too long to wait for a transaction to be secure.  Then Lightning came along, the idea being it's possible to actually make more secure instant payments (though there are still some caveats). Since it's faster than traditional payments, Nayuta decided it was the ""only"" solution to Internet of Thing's desire for payments that are as fast as the internet connections that fuel them.  One recently popular Internet of Things product is the so-called ""SmartLock."" Rather than requiring the metal keys we're all used to (just one more thing to remember), the rightful owner can use their smartphone to unlock it.  Showing the company's switch in gears toward Lightning, they released a proof of concept of such a lock that opens only once it's sent a Lightning payment.  Neither of these things are particularly useful, at least in the current form (why would anyone want to require a payment to unlock something?). But, as Nayuta sees it, these proof-of-concepts demonstrate how real-time payments can for Internet of Things more broadly, one of millions examples being a sensor gathering data about an ocean, and a researcher directly paying the sensor a small fee over the Internet to get that information.  The test payment was made between Nayuta's homegrown Lightning software implementation, dubbed ""Thunderbird"", and c-Lightning, an software implementation by bitcoin infrastructure startup Blockstream.  In that way, not only does Nayuta ""open the door"" to interesting Lightning use cases, it also diversifies the number of Lightning software implementations there are, which the company thinks is important, because, it believes, some features are missing from current Lightning implementations.  ""We do not think Lightning is ready,"" Nayuta CEO Kenichi Kurimoto told CoinDesk.  Lighting businesses emerge  All this feeds into the second interesting thing Nayuta is doing: It's one of the first companies to build a business around Lightning, showing that perhaps Lightning has a business proposition.  The handful of Lightning startups out there so far, such as Lightning Labs and Paris-based ACINQ are focused on the low-level technology, not building a product that their company around a particular application of Lightning.  Though, Kurimoto admitted they're not really being sure what to make out of all the prototypes they've launched over the last few years.  ""We did not decide the product future. Currently we're concentrating on development of the [Lightning Network] software,"" Kurimoto said, adding that one company that they can't disclose due to NDAA using their software so far.  Even so, Nayuta sees business promise in this area. Internet of Things payments have been floated for a long time, with even the likes giant payment processor Visa launching payment solutions in this area.  But, to Kurimoto, the current financial infrastructure is behind the times.  If refrigerators want to pay grocery stores and users want to use micropayments to pay for video and so forth, payments often need to be really small and fast. The current financial infrastructure wouldn't be able to handle it.  Kurimoto said:  ""The Lightning Network is the only solution for real-time transactions.""

Short-term housing rental startup Bee Token and financial services platform WeTrust are partnering to develop a ""decentralized insurance layer based on crowdsourced security deposits."" In other words, the deposits would act as a financial buffer for both the hosts listing on Bee Token's Beenest platform as well as well as guests.  To get there, the two startups plan to connect with one another to share information about users, including their overall trustworthiness as either tenants or hosts. The idea is that by bringing down the cost of a major pitfall – that is, insurance against possible property damage – the two companies can open up access to a residential-focused sharing economy.  CEO of WeTrust George Li was quoted as saying:  ""We couldn’t be happier about this partnership with Bee Token. This collaboration is exactly the sort of innovative use case that we believe will demonstrate the advantages of our platform in managing the complex processes involved with decentralized insurance and insurance-like products across diverse industries.""  Bee Token's platform has its own BEE token, which was just the subject of a $10 million presale. A public token sale begins at the end of this month.  In a recent interview with the San Francisco Chronicle, Bee Token co-founder Jonathan Chou suggested that the platform would, in a way, cater to those already exposed to the world of cryptocurrencies.  ""We cater heavily to the cryptocurrency audience to start; it’s not as intuitive to mainstream users"", Bee Token Co-founder Jonathan Chou told the newspaper.

42400938,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLTBq,1517202027,Can Bitcoin Be Destroyed? 7 (Unlikely) Paths to Irrelevance,"Sebastien Meunier is a financial services advisor with 15 years of experience in business innovation. He speaks on fintech and is a veteran startup mentor.      Before we get into the speculation, let's start with the facts – bitcoin has been declared dead more than 200 times.  Despite the fact that the world's first cryptocurrency has operated with near-100 percent uptime (for almost 10 years), it's still fashionable to predict its demise. Even supposedly smart people are known for propagating something I'll call ""bitcoin derangement syndrome."" They keep predicting bitcoin's demise even though they are daily proven wrong.  But if we assume that these individuals possess a level of intelligence, the only explanation for the failed predictions and emotional arguments is that they never take the time to study and understand how the system works.  In this way, I'd like to help by listing all the possible ways bitcoin could be destroyed.  Technically speaking, bitcoin will live as long as a handful of computers run the bitcoin software on a network. Only one extreme scenario would lead to annihilation. It is likely then that it will still be the top cryptocurrency in the coming years, unless the community destroys itself due to greed or carelessness.  Scenario 1: Armageddon  Likelihood (next 5 years): Close to zero  Impact: Sudden death  If all sources of electricity, internet and data communications were shut down across the planet, bitcoin nodes would not be able to contact each other. The system would be useless.  A temporary worldwide internet shutdown would certainly create confusion among the bitcoin community, but it's important to note that the system would (theoretically) just start again from the longest chain.  Even if hardcore fans or museums continue to run its software forever, bitcoin will never technically be extinct.  Scenario 2: Critical bug  Likelihood (next 5 years): Low  Potential impact: Sudden irrelevance  In this scenario, a bitcoin update could contain a bug on the level of the infamous DAO project (built on the ethereum blockchain), one that puts the integrity of the system at risk.  Even if the community agreed (which is not guaranteed) to fix the code, to install the new version and to restart the system, it would certainly lead to a crash of the price and a fork.  The bitcoin community is aware of the risk: any modification to the code is peer-reviewed and tested, in accordance to the contribution guidelines. That being said, only the NASA is able to produce software code with zero defect.  Scenario 3: Forked to irrelevance  Likelihood (next 5 years): Low  Potential impact: Slow irrelevance  Bitcoin can be forked multiples times if the community disagrees on the path forward, for technical reasons (or ""because money"").  The Bitcoin Cash split, which occurred last summer, was not that harmful for bitcoin because it saw the network's nodes and hash power decline. Theoretically, several splits could happen in which this network was further fragmented and its power reduced.  Should this occur, I believe bitcoin would lose its dominance, slowly sinking into irrelevance. Again, it is the interest of the community to not let this happen.  Scenario 4: Joint government crackdown  Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-low  Potential impact: Sudden irrelevance  Governments cannot destroy bitcoin itself because of its decentralized nature. However, they can control and restrict its use in their jurisdiction.  For instance, they can have the bank accounts of crypto companies closed, and they can forbid the creation of any and all related businesses. If only a handful of countries ban cryptocurrencies, the impact will be limited because businesses will simply move to friendlier jurisdictions.  This is exactly what happened after China banned its domestic order-book exchanges last year. And while the likelihood that one or more governments will go after bitcoin in the same way is almost assured, I think a global ban is almost impossible (imagine the United Nations reaching such a consensus).  Besides, bitcoin is already legal in Japan. If the US, EU, UK and China jointly banned cryptocurrencies, that would be very damaging.  However, it is more likely that they will regulate the cryptocurrency market to collect tax revenues while protecting individual investors.  Scenario 5: Major hack  Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-high  Potential impact: Temporary crash  This scenario could occur in a few different ways.  In the first, called a 51 percent attack, a malicious network actor could attempt to hack the protocol itself. This is theoretically possible, but its likelihood is very low.  From the inside, the 51 percent attackers would destroy their own source of profit. From the outside, it would require enormous investment in mining equipment and energy, and again the attacker’s source of profit would crash.  More likely is a hack then on an application built on top of the protocol.  When Mt. Gox was hacked back in 2014 (an example of this attack), it was handling 70 percent of all bitcoin transactions. Today, there are many more exchanges around the world. If one of them was hacked and a large amount of bitcoin stolen, the price would likely crash, but bitcoin would probably recover.  Recently, for example, $400 million worth of NEM was stolen from the exchange Coincheck: the price of NEM only went down by 15 to 20 percent and recovered in one day.  Scenario 6: ""Better"" cryptocurrency  Likelihood (next 5 years): Medium-to-low  Potential impact: Slow irrelevance  Is it possible for a ""better"" currency to replace bitcoin? (By ""better,"" I mean more profitable to mine and with lower transaction costs for users, everything else being equal.)  Let's face it: this is more about economics and less about convenience. That cryptocurrency would have to be much ""better"" to overcome the network effect and brand capital from which bitcoin benefits today.  The fact that it has not happened yet is telling. Besides, for governance and economic reasons (not a technical problem), a ""universal"" UN-backed cryptocurrency isn't likely to happen within five years.  There is another way economics could play out: if the price of electricity went up very significantly, mining could become unprofitable. Only large pools where electricity is relatively cheaper would remain.  This is a tough cost-security trade-off. Bitcoin would have to find a way to lower the cost of security while maintaining the integrity of the ledger.  Scenario 7: Market fatigue  Likelihood (next 5 years): Low  Potential impact: Slow irrelevance  If crypto startups fail to deliver any tangible value in the real world, people could slowly start to lose faith in cryptocurrencies and tokens. (Something that arguably happened during the bear market of 2015 and 2016).  In this case, the growth of the market could slow down and its value eventually stabilize. The crypto market would lose its attractiveness from an investment point of view, leading to further decline and so forth…  Personally, I do believe that some crypto startups will eventually create value in the real world. In any case, the crypto market is still nascent and we still have time until it gets boring. As history has shown also, the market is always capable of bouncing back.
