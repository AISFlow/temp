42397902,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWiO,1409407816,Community Honors Hal Finney with Bitcoin Fund for ALS Research,"In the wake of bitcoin groundbreaker Hal Finney's passing a few days ago, some prominent figures in the bitcoin community have teamed up in a campaign to raise funds for research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).  Erik Voorhees  , co-founder of Coinapult, Jason King of Sean’s Outpost, bitcoin evangelist Roger Ver, BitPay and the Bitcoin Foundation have collaborated to provide a way to donate bitcoin to ALS research.  Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen made the video above to kick off the campaign, named the Hal Finney Bitcoin Fund for ALS Research.  The main donation address is here. Donations will be accepted through the Thanksgiving holiday (27th November) in the US and the payment will be made on 2nd December.  Voting for a recipient  Since the ALS Association does not yet accept bitcoin donations, the Hal Finney Bitcoin Fund will accept nominations for a number of ALS organizations responsibly contributing to ALS research, and allow the community to vote on which organization will receive the bitcoins.  BitPay, which will handle the funds, has a 0% transaction fee policy for non-profit organisations, including this one, ensuring that 100% of donors' funds will go to the research organization selected.  The Bitcoin Foundation has donated the first $100 to the campaign in honor of Finney and his contribution to the bitcoin project.  Spreading ALS awareness  ALS, also known as “Lou Gehrig’s Disease"", is a fatal, progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Over time, motor neurons degenerate and the person loses motor functionality and muscles begin to atrophy.  Finney  was first diagnosed with the disease in 2009, not long after he assisted Satoshi Nakamoto in getting bitcoin off the ground. It forced him to retire from work in 2011.  ALS research is also the target of a social media campaign that has gone viral in recent weeks, in which participants dump buckets of iced water over their heads and nominate peers and associates to do the same, if not donate to the ALS Association. The campaign has drenched some of the world's most influential people, including Bill Gates and former US president George W. Bush, among others.

42397901,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWjN,1409406336,Meet the British Crown Dependencies Vying To Become Bitcoin Island,"Bitcoin entrepreneurs seeking a friendly jurisdiction for their business could do worse than end up on the Isle of Man, the picturesque British Crown dependancy located in the Irish Sea.  The island's government has been quick to embrace cryptocurrency companies, by offering a regulatory environment friendly to digital currencies while promoting other initiatives to encourage cryptocurrency startups to set up shop there.  On the island, entrepreneurs are likely to find themselves in the company of Peter Greenhill, whose job is to promote bitcoin and other digital initiatives on the government's behalf. Greenhill is a busy man these days, conducting several tours a week for businesses interested in setting up on the Isle.  ""There are 20 [cryptocurrency businesses] that have already set up their operations here. Some are recruiting as we speak,"" he said. ""Every week that goes past, there's more interest.""  Attracting bitcoin businesses has become something of a trend among British crown dependencies these days. On the other side of the United Kingdom are the Channel Islands, the largest of which is Jersey, which is emerging as the Isle's principle rival as a base for digital currency entrepreneurs.  About the islands  Administrators on the islands say that bitcoin businesses are high-tech opportunities to create jobs and boost economic activity. Both Jersey and the Isle of Man have long sought to use their legal positions to carve out lucrative economic niches for themselves. Now they're turning to bitcoin as a potential new growth engine.  The Isle of Man, for example, is home to some of the biggest online poker and gambling sites in the world. The world's largest poker site, Pokerstars, has its headquarters there and is regulated by the island's Gambling Supervision Commission. The online gambling industry accounts for nearly 10%, worth about £340m, of the island's economy.  Jersey has established itself as a global offshore financial centre, and in doing so is in regular entanglements with international tax authorities. France recently removed the island from its tax blacklist of ""uncooperative jurisdictions"" after intensive negotiations, for example. Financial services is the island's largest economic sector.  The two islands are the largest Crown dependencies, with gross domestic product of about £3bn each. Alderney, which neighbours Jersey, tried to get into the bitcoin game by minting physical coins, but its plans were ultimately scuppered for political reasons. But even the big island economies have struggled in recent years, with layoffs from big banks and a less buoyant financial services sector hitting the islands hard.  A glance at the cryptocurrency events calendar sums up the increasingly heated competition between the islands. Next month, while Jersey's treasury and resources minister delivers a keynote address at the Inside Bitcoins conference in London, promoting his jurisdiction to the assembled cryptorati, the Isle of Man will be busy welcoming guests to its own confab, the Crypto Valley Summit.  The bitcoin opportunity  Perhaps paradoxically, the islands are hoping to offer businesses the antithesis of a tax haven when it comes to attracting digital currency companies. They want to offer more regulation instead of less. Jersey, for example, is now home to the first bitcoin hedge fund overseen by a financial regulator. Greenhill said:  ""It's not the Wild West. We're doing things properly, and companies seem to be very happy about that.""  When a bitcoin firm wants to set up on the Isle of Man to take advantage of government benefits, for example, it is subjected to some scrutiny, Greenhill said.  ""We look at the company and its business plan, we check that its anti-money laundering procedures are absolutely in place, we do spot checks to make sure everything's being done properly,"" he added.  One exchange's experience  The promise of greater regulation in the freewheeling world of digital currency startups seems to be working. Charlie Woolnough set up his exchange, CoinCorner, on the Isle of Man in July. Woolnough has personal ties to the island – he was born there – but he chose to set up shop there after a decade in investment banking in the City of London.  He said:  ""Even if I tried to look at it from a top-down perspective, I would have made the same choice anyway. In a nutshell, the advantage I see in the Isle of Man is the government stance on bitcoin. They were the first to say they are bitcoin-friendly.""  Woolnough, who has also taken on a role promoting the island as chairman of the local digital currency association, also says the Isle of Man has simply got more space than rival islands. It measures about 500 square kilometres, while Jersey can offer about a fifth of the space.  ""If you're looking for a physical location rather than just a jurisdiction for tax benefits, then Isle of Man has a lot more space than Jersey and Guernsey, and it's cheaper to acquire that space,"" he said.  Industry lobby groups  Over in Jersey, an industry group calling itself bit.coin.je launched in June, in an attempt to turn the territory into ""Bitcoin Isle"". Regulation and an established financial services infrastructure were two of the advantages digital currency companies could make use of, officials and bit.coin.je spokespeople told the BBC.  Cryptocurrency companies would form part of the island's ""planned diversification"" strategy, according to Greenhill's Jersey counterpart, Andy Jarrett. It's part of a broader push by the Jersey government to find economic growth in 'fintech', or financial technology, companies. Jarrett is director of Digital Jersey, the government entity that was created to promote fintech companies and the technology sector in general.  ""Fintech is a sector that holds significant opportunities for Jersey. The government has been very clear that it will offer its full support for innovative measures undertaken by the industry and the regulator,"" Jarrett said.  While neither Greenhill nor Jarrett could quantify the economic opportunity presented by cryptocurrencies in job creation or in GDP terms, both administrators agreed that promoting growth in the sector would help the islands achieve their economic goals.  ""It's very clear that the train has left the station. Anyone who thinks [cryptocurrencies] won't grow hasn't realised the power behind that train,"" Greenhill said.  Even as the Crown dependencies hang their hopes on a booming cryptocurrency sector that will add jobs and grow national income, the risk of welcoming another Mt Gox and having it implode on their regulators' watch continues to loom. For now, however, officials like Greenhill are happy to live with that risk. He said:  ""Our measures obviously reduce risk in general, but, as we move forward, if we were to do nothing, then there would still be an industry out there, except it would simply be less regulated.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/30/meet-the-british-crown-dependencies-vying-to-become-bitcoin-island,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea72e990f1b519122c0eff7dfb9e6963356d4dce-1000x686.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397921,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEX06,1409392505,9 Companies That Should Really Start Accepting Bitcoin,"There once was a time when owning bitcoin meant keeping it idle and unspent in your wallet of choice.  Considering that bitcoin was designed to be transacted, the lack of merchants that accepted bitcoin back then was frustrating to many in the community.  Luckily for us, things have changed.  Some of bitcoin's best features can be seen when businesses receive the digital currency as payment for goods and services: reduced transaction fees, no chargebacks to worry about and an unexpected but significant side effect – a marketing boost.  These features have been enough to draw the attention of several million- and billion dollar companies into the world of bitcoin this year, like Dell, Expedia, Overstock and Dish, which have all integrated bitcoin payments into their business models since the start of 2014.  It's important to note that nearly anybusiness can accept bitcoin payments. Companies like Coinbase and Bitpay have made the process a breeze for businesses both small and large.  With that said, there are some companies that are particularly poised to accept bitcoin and reap the rewards of doing so.  Most of these companies have something in common: many are high-tech companies with high-tech customers who may skew on the bitcoin-friendly side, many are companies that fulfill everyday needs of their customers, and many are already known for their openness to experiment with new technology.  Here are nine companies that should really start accepting bitcoin:  1. Airbnb  Airbnb is shaking up the hospitality industry with its community-based business model for users to book travel accommodations. The service is a favorite among the younger, tech-savvy crowd, so adding bitcoin as a payment option could certainly behoove the San Francisco-based startup.  Having bitcoin payments integrated on Airbnb isn't just wishful thinking, though. There have been whispers in the industry that PayPal subsidiary BrainTree (which provides payment software for Airbnb and the second company on this list, among others) is ""in talks"" with Coinbase about accepting bitcoin on its platform.  2. Uber (or Lyft)  Uber's mobile app payment software, like Airbnb's, is provided by BrainTree, so if the rumors are true, we may not be too far away from being able to pay for Uber rides with bitcoin.  Aside from pure convenience, if the BrainTree-Coinbase comes to fruition, there are still many reasons why Uber should start accepting bitcoin. Uber customers already use a mobile app to order, communicate with, and pay for their ride, and as such it wouldn't be a far leap for the all-digital company to add bitcoin as a payment option.  Adding bitcoin payments could offer a more nuanced benefit for Uber, though. Competitor Lyft is gaining market share rather quickly, and some have criticized that the two companies offer no distinct benefits over its respective competitor. Integrating bitcoin could offer a PR boost to the first in the market to embrace the progressive technology.  3. Amazon  The world's largest online retailer has changed commerce forever by bringing almost everything imaginable into the digital world, so it's a bit surprising to some that Amazon has been slow to warm up to digital currencies.  Bitcoin is particularly convenient for making purchases online (compared to brick-and-mortar stores), and for many other reasons it seems obvious the digital currency would be a great fit for Amazon.  Part of why Amazon may not have the impetus to embrace bitcoin like other online retailers have could be that the retailer enjoys lower credit card transaction fees than most retailers, simply due to the volume of orders the company processes. Still, the fees add up, and adding bitcoin as a payment option could help Amazon's bottom line.  4. Netflix  Netflix is another company well-known for disrupting the status quo. Once dismissed as just another movie streaming platform, the media company is now a pioneer of the digital format for new content creation, like its Emmy-award winning original series Orange is the New Black.  Though the model of recurring payments that Netflix uses has yet to be explored with bitcoin on a large scale, the company could potentially draw in new customers by adding an option to pay for subscriptions with bitcoin, and it's not a stretch to imagine this functionality right on the Netflix home screen.  5. Comcast (or Time Warner Cable)  In the same vein as Netflix, cable TV giant Comcast could stand to benefit from accepting bitcoin payments, though not for the same reasons.  Comcast has been going through a bit of a public relations disaster recently, after a number of recorded customer support phone calls were uploaded online. The phone calls were damning to Comcast's reputation, and while customers may not have much of a choice in their cable provider, there's a good chance that allowing customers to pay their TV and Internet bills with bitcoin would win some points in its retention department.  6. Delta (or any major airline)  Sure, there are a select few airlines like airBaltic and Air Lituanica where bitcoiners can buy flights with their beloved digital currency, but the rest of the airline industry should catch up sooner, rather than later.  For one, major airlines have struggled to keep up with the cutting-edge of technology. If Delta, which flies more passengers than any other airline, were to accept bitcoin, it would distinguish itself from competitors as technologically progressive and save considerable amounts of money on credit card chargebacks.  Add the fact that there's probably a decent amount of bitcoin holders who would be eager to splurge on a vacation if they could pay with BTC, and the choice becomes even more clear.  7. Starbucks  Coffee is an everyday luxury for many people around the world, and few would argue that Starbucks has more brand power than any of its competitors.  Accepting bitcoin would be strategic for Starbucks in more ways than simply luring new techy-savvy customers to its stores. The Seattle-based coffee chain has found big success with its mobile payment app, and the company's CEO, Howard Schulz, has made it clear that Starbucks is focused on mobile and digital (which happen to be two areas that fit perfectly with bitcoin), saying:  ""No single competency is enabling us to elevate the Starbucks brand more than our global leadership in mobile, digital, and loyalty. Starbucks is a clear leader in mobile payments and we are encouraged by how consumers have embraced mobile apps as a way to pay.""  8. Whole Foods (or any major grocer)  While it may not be the same experience as treating yourself to a coffee, grocery shopping is something that most everybody does on a regular basis.  Of course we in the bitcoin community would like to be able to use the digital currency to pay for all of our needs, but the benefits wouldn't be completely one-sided if Whole Foods or any other major grocer started accepting bitcoin.  Grocery stores, like airlines, have struggled to keep up with the pace of technology, but Whole Foods has successfully positioned itself as more progressive and ""hip"" than most of its competitors.  Being the first nation-wide grocer to accept bitcoin would solidify this reputation, and it would set the tone for grocers around the world to allow unbanked customers to pay for their groceries with ease.  9. Venmo  Venmo is one of the most popular mobile payment apps right now, and more people keep flocking to the platform to send friends and businesses money for free.  The platform is so well-fit to add bitcoin as a payment option that it's almost baffling it hasn't happened yet. With bitcoin payments as an added feature, Venmo would diversify its offerings and bring in a whole new wave of users at the same time.  The benefits of accepting bitcoin don't stop at these nine companies, though.  Unlike some traditional financial systems, bitcoin doesn't discriminate. Pioneers like Overstock and Expedia have reported that their bitcoin revenues have exceeded expectations, and in doing so have helped lead the way for other businesses to join them.

42397900,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEWhP,1409364519,Charlie Shrem Hopes to Walk Free After Guilty Plea Deal,"Bitcoin entrepreneur and former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem hopes to walk free after striking a deal to plead guilty to 'unlicensed money transmission' in New York.  For Shrem, it's the end of seven months of house arrest, restrictions on movement and uncertainty.  The plea bargain is a step down from prosecutors' original charges and strong statements, which also included money laundering and conspiracy and failing to file suspicious activity reports with government banking authorities, relating to former online black marketplace Silk Road.  Shrem told CoinDesk he had faced a penalty of up to 30 years imprisonment if convicted of the more serious charges under the PATRIOT Act, which would have also tied him to drug trafficking and terrorism financing. He said:  ""So, this is a first step of many, but I'm happy to not be going to trial, and moving forward.""  The plea deal does not guarantee his freedom, he said, but he remained confident – no one has yet served jail time for unlicensed money transmission alone.  Immediate plans  Shrem said there were no restrictions on his becoming involved with bitcoin-related business once more, and he had immediate plans involving his consulting work with payments company Payza.  ""Right now I'm busy with Payza. We're doing tons of volume with our first rollout and we have many plans. Payza will be the first merchant processor to offer both credit card AND bitcoin processing.""  Shrem said he had other plans but was ""keeping them under wraps for now"".  He also plans to travel to Denver in two weeks to attend fellow bitcoin entrepreneur Erik Voorhees' wedding.    I hope to be partying at @ErikVoorhees wedding next month :) RT @CharlieShrem excellent news to start the weekend! When's the party?      – Charlie Shrem (‏@CharlieShrem) 30 Aug 2014    ""I was there when he proposed and super happy I'm not missing it,"" Shrem added.  White collar crimes  Hearing Shrem's case is US District Judge Jed S Rakoff. Rakoff recently penned an editorial in the New York Review of Books regretting the difficulties the authorities have faced in successfully prosecuting more serious charges such as fraud, or failing to report suspicious activity, especially with regard to the recent global financial crisis.  Having these charges removed from the list is likely a confidence booster for Shrem.  He was initially arrested in public circumstances at New York's John F. Kennedy airport on 27th January, as he arrived home from a bitcoin conference in Amsterdam.  Though he resigned his position on the Bitcoin Foundation Board of Directors as a result of the arrest, he maintained he was not guilty and still enjoyed the support of many in the bitcoin community.  He was first unleashed from confinement to his parents' house in Brooklyn in April, to attend the premiere of documentary 'The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin', and also attended a banking industry conference in New York in July to speak about risks banks faced when dealing with bitcoin issues. He led a panel at July's North American Bitcoin Conference in Chicago via a telepresence robot.  Co-defendant Robert Faiella  According to a court schedule notice released to the public, Shrem's co-defendant in the case, Robert Faiella of Florida, was also mentioned – but it was not clear whether or not he would also make a deal (or even if one was offered).  Faiella, aka 'BTCKing', is accused of selling $1m in bitcoins to drug traffickers and funneling them to Shrem's BitInstant. Faiella has no prior criminal record.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/30/charlie-shrem-hopes-to-walk-free-after-guilty-plea-deal,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e0bed537ca6aedd22f4997c208aed1755863b62-2560x1764.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
