42378032,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LuvF,1425078001,"Swarm Offers Up to $50,000 to Second Startup Class","Swarm has partnered with Focus Investments to fund its second class of startups.  The fund will provide between $5,000 and $50,000 in funding to startups accepted into the round, which follows its first announced in October. Participants in its inaugural round included Coinspace, Manna and a decentralised dance party.  Focus invests primarily in bitcoin ventures and projects such as Counterparty, Factom, GetGems and NXT. A decentralized crowdfunding platform, Swarm helps startups establish themselves as distributed collaborative organisations (DCOs), allowing them to sell cryptographic tokens to raise funds.  CEO Joel Dietz indicated that Swarm is putting a greater emphasis on ""the governance aspect"" or DCO model for its startups following a recent legal seminar it sponsored that sought to address legal challenges in the crypto 2.0 space.  At the event, legal experts in the cryptocurrency space put forth a working paper that suggested DCOs, where tokens are used to denote membership in an organisation, were among the safer legal models for projects looking to raise money.  Tokens remain tradable and can increase in value, giving backers the option to sell their stake in the project to an interested third party.  Applicants can register online until 3rd March.

42378033,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Lutz,1425075359,Bitcoin Derivatives Platform TeraExchange to Go Public in Merger,"MGT Capital Investments has entered into an agreement with Tera Group that would find the operator of the first regulated bitcoin derivatives platform TeraExchange going public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) MKT, the leading equities capital market for small cap companies.  The New Jersey-based company framed the news as that which would open up the NYSE to a bitcoin venture for the first time.  TeraExchange CEO Christian Martin and president and COO Leonard Nuara explained that the company had been looking to enter the capital markets for three months, and that in MGT it was able to find a partner seeking to enter the bitcoin space, as well.  Martin further spoke to the importance of bitcoin for TeraExchange, telling CoinDesk:  “Bitcoin consumes the majority of our mindshare here in our firm. It’s our bitcoin listing and subsequent certification that has the most commercial possibilities for us right now, and it’s a business we’re very keen to cultivate and nurture along.”  Though others have taken similar paths to market, TeraExchange indicated that it believes the move will give both itself and the bitcoin industry greater visibility in the capital markets.  Other public bitcoin companies like Bitcoin Shop trade OTC, while WPCS, the former owners of BTX Trader, and BitGold have traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market Composite or will trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange, respectively.  Once public, Nuara indicated investors would likely see TeraExchange “ramp up” the release of stats and statistics about its marketplace, one that he described as “just getting its legs” following its approval from the CFTC and launch late last year.  The agreement, scheduled to be finalized on 16th March and approved by shareholders, would see MGT issue shares of its common stock to Tera Group representing 70% of the company’s pro forma equity.

42378038,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Luxl,1425070828,Study: Consumers Feel Bitcoin More Secure than Mobile Payments Apps,"A new survey shows that US consumers believe payments made with bitcoin are safer than those conducted using mobile wallets or apps.  The report, published by Chicago-based Walker Sands Communications, focuses on changes in retail payments behavior, particularly as it pertains to digital transaction methods.  Ultimately, it found that 3% of respondents said that they consider bitcoin to be the most secure form of payments, compared to 1% for mobile phone or wallets. The study was conducted using a sample group of 1,400 consumers.  The report said:  ""Consumers consider mobile wallets and apps the least secure form of payment, even ranking behind cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.""  Cash ranked highest on the list of trusted payment methods. Fifty-six percent reported that they prefer cash over alternative payment methods, compared to 22% for credit cards and 18% for debit cards.  Just 2% said they think checks are the most trustworthy payment method.  Elsewhere, the report found evidence of a broader shift toward digital payments, one that it said has been accelerated by the introduction of mobile payments products like Apple Pay.

42378035,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Luz1,1425065753,Russian Lawmaker: Bitcoin is a CIA Conspiracy,"A lawmaker from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia is speaking out against bitcoin and other digital currencies on the grounds the technology is part of a US plot to undermine the country’s efforts internationally.  The comments, made by MP Andrei Svintsov, came during remarks addressing the ongoing debate in Russia over whether bitcoin and digital currencies should be banned as part of a broader effort to stop capital flight.  Nonetheless, Svintsov’s remarks count as some of the more extreme to emanate from the discussion. Svintsov told Russian broadcast news agency REGNUM:  ""All these cryptocurrencies [were] created by US intelligence agencies just to finance terrorism and revolutions.”  Svintsov reportedly went on to explain how cryptocurrencies have started to become a payment method for consumer spending, and cited reports that terrorist organisations are seeking to use the technology for illicit means.  While pointed, the statements do not seem to represent the views on bitcoin from within the federal legislature. For example, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets has stated as recently as August that she opposes criminal penalties for bitcoin use.  Svintsov has also been associated with such movements as one that would find tobacco and alcohol products removed from the windows of retail outlets.

42378031,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7Luox,1425062426,Bitcoin in the Headlines: Macroeconomics Debated,"Being a controversial technology, bitcoin has once again managed to captivate the media's attention over the last few days.  Having seemingly recovered from the bad news fatigue that riddled the headlines last week, the mainstream media seems to have engaged in the bitcoin debate, trying to find ways to tie the technology to larger trends and events.  On one side of the battle field, the media believes that the digital currency could potentially be adopted by countries wanting to mitigate their national debt, or by central authorities who wish to keep up with the times by adopting it.  In contrast, the naysayers, argue that bitcoin will never ever replace fiat – a currency so highly guarded by governments.  So, what's the real deal?  CoinDesk takes a look at the week's headlines from across the world.  Bitcoin as 'digital gold'  The week's coverage started off with Paul Mason's Guardian article exploring whether a bitcoin-style virtual currency could potentially solve the Greek financial crisis.  Greece, crisis and bitcoin all in one sentence – sparks flew.  Mason said that the Greek crisis could potentially lead the way for ""one of the most audacious pieces of lateral thinking ever ... a parallel digital currency, issued by the Greek government"".  In case you are wondering, Greece owes a ""mere"" €317bn, otherwise translated as 175% of its GDP.  This proposed digital currency would be modeled on bitcoin, but with one crucial difference.  Mason said:  ""Bitcoin is an audacious attempt to create money beyond the control of any state. It is a digital currency, in the form of a limited number of tokens.""  He went on to explain that the currency is championed by people who would like to see the return of the gold standard – a system that obliges states to limit the amount of national currency issued, supported by money fundamentalists.  Then things got really interesting, with Mason concluding:  ""Bitcoin's aim is to function as digital gold.""  The Varoufakis effect  But, why would the Greek government ever want to issue a digital currency alongside its centralised one?  Cue Yanis Varoufakis, who published a blog post a year ago, discussing the possibility that Greece could create a parallel digital currency, using bitcoin's digital security and transparency, doing the exact opposite of what the money fundamentalists wanted.  Varoufakis predicted the currency would provide: “a source of liquidity for the governments that is outside the bond markets, which does not involve the banks and which lies outside any of the restrictions imposed by Brussels or the various troikas"".  Forbes' Tim Worstall said that ""Greece simply would not allow to do this.""  Despite describing Mason's piece as ""interesting"", Worstall insisted that ""The ECB would cut off the Greek banks immediately and that would be that, game over"".  The Forbes contributor continued to say that Varoufakis' initial analysis was correct, but that he was not talking about the fiscal constraints upon the Greek government.  He went on to say:  ""The conclusion to be drawn from what [Varoufakis] is saying is that Greece should leave the euro. Which, of course, is also true but then we've been saying that for a long time.""  Whether this is true or not, only time will tell.    The award goes to the FT Alphaville for providing the most amusing – and perhaps sarcastic – of headlines: ""Greek funny money: no thanks.""      The publication has dismissed the digital currency's potential in the past, but this time, David Keohane, puts it simply, saying that ""it's a very silly idea"".    Bitcoin's 'legitimate' value  Forbes' Bill Conerly shook things up a bit, discussing the potential benefits that bitcoin adoption would bring to mainstream merchants.  The Forbes' contributor said that bitcoin was a better way to do transactions. ""Forget about bitcoin as an investment vehicle, or bitcoin as a way to end the Federal Reserve.""  He added:  ""Its benefit to business comes from payments.""  Perhaps in an attempt to reassure the skeptics, Conerly said that ""the merchant taking bitcoin is not going to make headlines for customer data being hacked"". He explained that ""the only information the merchant has are codes with each individual transaction"".  The contributor concluded that bitcoin ""is not for everyone"", but it offers ""legitimate value to many companies"".  Bank of England explores bitcoin  The Bank of England made headlines this week after it published One Bank Research Agenda, a paper which looks into the possibility of the authority issuing its own digital currency based on bitcoin technology.  A google news search brought up a total 85 articles.  However, the price of bitcoin was perhaps unsurprisingly unaffected by the announcement.  The Telegraph ran a piece by Peter Spence, with ""Bitcoin revolution could be the next internet, says Bank of England"" as its headline, regurgitating the comparison between the digital currency and the Internet.  City AM also published an article, titled ""Could the Bank of England one day embrace Bitcoin?"". Note the use of the word ""embrace""  In her piece, Jessica Morris, issues a warning to bitcoin fanatics, concluding:  ""The central bank would need a rationale for issuing a digital currency, as well as addressing the economic, technological and regulatory challenges of doing so.""  Jonathan O'Callaghan's piece in the Daily Mail, led with ""Is the Bank of England going to create its Bitcoin? Minting a digital currency could eradicate high street lenders"".  In his piece, O'Callaghan, notes that despite the Bank of England saying bitcoin ""could become as common as modern banknotes"", the authority also warned ""that there are a number of problems – and if consumers flocked to digital currencies, it might leave high street lenders devoid of customers"".  Perhaps an unlikely possibility, but one that O'Callaghan thought was worth highlighting.  Another month is drawing to an end and the lack of consensus among the media means that we are each left to draw our own conclusions about bitcoin's potential – or lack thereof – to flourish in the ""real"" world.

42378025,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7LulB,1425048862,DigitalBTC Reports Net Loss On Falling Bitcoin Price,"Australian bitcoin company Digital CC Ltd has published the results for its half-year period up to 31st December 2014, posting a $2.3m net loss after tax.    Notably, the firm was the first bitcoin company to be listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), trading as digitalBTC.  ""The statutory loss recorded for the half has been impacted by necessary accounting adjustments flowing from digital currency price declines,"" executive chairman Zhenya Tsvetnenko said.  The firm's total revenue was $14.5m. Of this, $9.9m came from its liquidity desk and $9.9m from digitalX Direct sales. The revenue from bitcoin mining was $4.6m.  Net income before interest, taxes, depreciation etc (EBITDA) was $216,934.  Tsvetnenko said:    “Our half year has seen significant growth in our liquidity desk and digitalX Direct operations, as well as investments made in our early mover position in digital currencies.""              The company aired plans to continue focusing on the development of its software applications, such as digitalX Mintsy and digitalX Pocket, which will allow consumers ""fast and secure transactions regardless of size and geography"".    Mining deals  The announcement comes soon after Digital CC dissolved a relationship with cloud mining platform CloudHashing.  Under the agreement, which was finalised in March, CloudHashing was to run digitalBTC hardware in data centres in Iceland and Texas to mine bitcoins.  On 30th January, the firm filed an announcement with the ASX stating that the companies had agreed to end the supply deal.  Just previously, on 25th January, digitalBTC announced it was expanding its mining capacity and entering a new hosting contract with data centre provider Verne Global.  The company said at the time it was acquiring new bitcoin mining hardware from manufacturer Spondoolies-Tech that would expand its processing capacity by approximately 40% for a ""small outlay"" of about $700,000.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/27/digitalbtc-reports-net-loss-on-falling-bitcoin-price,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b1b05e309be152d007b2e5986d1695881bf4e99-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42395306,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxASaHCw,1425040459,Igot Expands Exchange and Remittance Services to Kenya,"Bitcoin exchange igot has expanded to Kenya following the acquisition of TagPesa, a local cryptocurrency exchange and remittance gateway, and integration with M-Pesa's mobile payments service.  Igot's Kenyan customers can now use the exchange's services by depositing and withdrawing Kenyan shillings either from their local bank accounts or their M-Pesa accounts.  The company, which is based in Australia, also provides remittance services to over 40 countries worldwide, including the EU, Middle East and Africa. The acquisition of TagPesa allows igot customers around the world to send funds directly into a friend or relative's Kenyan bank account.  Rick Day, co-founder of igot, said that Kenya's remittance market was huge and ""largely untouched by bitcoin companies"".  While over 2.5 million Kenyan emigrants around the world currently remit money back to the African nation, Day said, traditional money sending services currently available are expensive.  He said:  ""Bitcoin offers to solve this problem and igot plans to use this tool to make global transfers much easier.""  ""We hope that this market would perform really well in the next six to 12 months,"" he continued. ""We expect to get a lot more traction as bitcoin becomes more ubiquitous.""  How it works  Users can deposit and withdraw funds using their regular bank account or their M-Pesa account.  However, in order to complete a transaction, the exchange requires that the user becomes verified by providing scans of a government-issued identity card and a utility bill.  To deposit funds, the consumer will have to create an order and then proceed to transfer the money via their bank or M-Pesa account.  Once this process is completed, the bitcoin will be deposited in the user's igot wallet.  To remit money, customers must visit the 'Global Transfer' section of the site from the navigation menu, select the country to which they want to send funds, and complete the form with amount and recipient's name and local bank details.  Future Plans  Igot will continue to monitor the remittance market, said Day, explaining that the exchange will introduce new features to attract ""not only the seasoned bitcoin traders, but also everyday people who may have heard about bitcoin but want to use it with ease and for something other than just speculating"".  The company's 'Pay your bill' and 'Pay your Rent' bitcoin features have performed well in the Australian market, he continued, saying that these would be rolled out to other markets in future.  The co-founder also commented on the possibility of expanding to India. Indian e-commerce has soared in the last five years, he said, adding that they ""were in the process of integrating some big names there to accept bitcoin as a payment method"".  He concluded:  ""We want to be their obvious choice in the local market to accept bitcoin.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/02/27/igot-expands-exchange-and-remittance-services-to-kenya,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/67dd743fa45ea0f2fc720e12245658d9def64744-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
