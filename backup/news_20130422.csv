42424817,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWk1h,1366666119,Bitfloor exchange bites the dust,"Alternative bitcoin exchange Bitfloor shocked users last week by announcing it was shutting its doors. The exchange said that its US bank account was closing, and it wouldn’t be able to handle the same volumes as it was used to.  “Unfortunately, our US bank account is scheduled to be closed and we can no longer provide the same level of USD deposits and withdrawals as we have in the past,” Bitfloor founder Roman Shtylman wrote in a statement on the website. “As such, I have made the decision to halt operations and return all funds.”  The site promised to work with all clients to return any bitcoins they had outstanding.  Over the weekend, Bitfloor reported that its bank had issued a check for the remaining account balance. ""Once this check is received, we will be working to establish a way to return the remaining USD funds,"" it said, adding that it expects receipt by the end of the month. ""Until then, we will be unable to make any further payouts.""  Compared to Mt. Gox, the dominant bitcoin exchange, Bitfloor was a small player. The smaller exchange was one of several that provide a welcome alternative for exchanging bitcoins, especially when Mt. Gox came under attack from hackers.  However, Bitfloor had also suffered from its own troubles in the past. In September 2012, it had to close temporarily after hackers compromised its network and stole most of the bitcoins -- some 24,000 BTC, or around $250,000 worth at existing exchange rates -- that the exchange had on hand.  ""One of the last things I want to happen is for Bitfloor to shut down and cause more panic in the bitcoin community,"" Shtylman stated at the time, acknowledging the effect that an exchange shutdown would have on the currency.  The latest development with Bitfloor isn't likely to help bitcoin's reputation, and the lack of further explanation will do little to bolster confidence. This, along with other problems among bitcoin exchanges, shows the market is still struggling toward maturity.  Bitfloor’s demise leaves even fewer alternatives to Mt. Gox, which itself was felled by a massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on April 10.  Early Monday, the Japan-based Mt. Gox reported on its Facebook page that it was undergoing yet another strong DDoS attack. ""We are working hard to overcome it and will update when possible,"" the company stated.  This latest report has infuriated some Mt. Gox users, who called it ""a plain lie,"" and predicted the exchange's demise in the comments.  In mid-April, when bitcoin prices spiked, Australian exchange Bit Innovate reported it had to temporarily close its Buy Bitcoins service. In that case, the problems were less technical and more economic; the exchange had simply run out of bitcoins to sell.  Some of the larger alternative exchanges still available include Bitstamp, BTC-e, and Bitcoin China. These trade at just a fraction of Mt. Gox’s volumes, however. There are also several far smaller exchanges still trading.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/22/bitfloor-exchange-bites-the-dust,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424810,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWjrh,1366643569,"'Give us bitcoins,' developers say","Open-source software projects are starting to use bitcoins as a way to pay programmers for their work.  Open-source software is developed under a license that enables anyone to view and modify its source code. Many commercial projects use open-source code, and popular software such as Linux is based on it.  Although most open-source developers volunteer, there has also been a growing tradition of bounty sites, which will pay open-source developers for their help in developing software.  These sites have used traditional currencies. Now, Bitcoin Bounties has a system that will enable programmers to be paid in bitcoins for helping to develop or fix software.  Founded by Portland, Oregon-based programmer Ryan Casey, the site focuses on fixing software bugs, using the GitHub collaborative programming site.  GitHub hosts a plethora of software development projects, started by its users. Each project has a central repository, where the most up-to-date version of the source code is kept.  GitHub enables users to contribute to a software project by connecting to the repository, and making a copy of it. This version of the code is called a ""fork"". User make changes to their individual code forks and then, when they are ready to have it considered for inclusion in the main project, they issue a request. A project administrator can then decide whether to include it, at which point the changes are written into the central repository.  All projects maintain lists of unresolved bugs that need fixing. In most cases, interested GitHub programmers will volunteer their time, but Bitcoin Bounties offers members the chance to speed up the process by paying people with bitcoins.  GitHub users can paste links to a project’s unresolved issues into the Bitcoin Bounties web form. Other users can connect their accounts, enabling them to work on the issues and be paid.  Casey, who formerly worked at medical site WebMD, took two weeks to develop the system. He explained that the bounties can be funded by groups of people. Anyone who sees a software issue posted on the site can pledge bitcoins to it. Bitcoins are sent to an online wallet, and they are held there until at least 24 hours after the GitHub issue is closed. Bitcoin Bounties keeps 0.5% of all bounties paid.  ""I am technically an escrow service,"" Casey said. ""The people send the bitcoins to the bitcoin address and it goes to our wallet. Then I transfer the bitcoins off our wallet in the server, to an offline wallet. Then every 24 hours, any issues that were closed out, I pay out from the offline wallet.”  Following criticism in an online forum for holding the money, Casey is now reconsidering the model for the site. He points to a multi-party transaction capability within the bitcoin architecture, which allows a third party to co-sign a transaction between two people. Until all parties sign the transaction, it will not go through, and the money sits in limbo, not controlled by any one party. This allows the third party to arbitrate any dispute between the sender and receiver of the bitcoins, without actually holding the money.  ""That particular application isn’t that well known yet,"" Casey said. ""It’s got a lot of potential.""  However, all of this will have to wait. No sooner had Casey launched the site than another company, preparing a service called Code Bounty, contacted him and asked him to join forces so that it could bitcoin-enable its forthcoming service. Casey is working there for three weeks to evaluate the project, during which he is freezing work on his own site.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/22/give-us-bitcoins-developers-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424806,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWjlh,1366641774,Bitcoin prices yo-yo in Q1,"Q1 2013 is practically ancient history for bitcoin, given its severe price movements this month, but it's worth a look back to see just how far the digital currency has come since the beginning of the year.  Just a few months ago, ""bitcoin was a $100 million 'idea' with growing interest from a niche community,"" Coinsetter said in a blog post analyzing the first quarter:  ""Over the past three months, the currency’s substantial growth and usefulness in tough economic situations has led to a visible shift in bitcoin’s position in the financial world, culminating in an aggregate valuation of $1 billion.""  Bitcoin experienced a steady run up in price over the first quarter, with an average daily return of 4.2% over the period, Coinsetter notes. Prices ranged from a low of $13.16 early in the period to a high of $95.70.  ""All in all, a bitcoin trader holding the currency from its low to its high over the period would have earned a lucrative 627% return,"" the Coinsetter blog states.  Trading volume also experienced growth, doubling from 156,889 bitcoins traded on Mt. Gox in January to 324,876 bitcoins traded in March.  In addition, the average trade size increased in Q1, rising from $151 in January to $378 in March:  ""This is interesting because it demonstrates that traders are becoming comfortable with larger transactions, and it's likely that more experienced players are entering the market,"" Coinsetter points out.  Volatility also came into play in Q1, with eight days having price swings greater than 20% and 21 days with price swings larger than 10%. On a monthly basis, the price swing (monthly range as a percentage of minimum price) was 63% in January, 92% in February and 191% in March. The standard deviation of prices was 13% in January, 15% in February, and 31% in March.  ""Needless to say, if your strategy benefits from volatility, you should be trading bitcoin,"" Coinsetter concludes.  Coinsetter predicts continued growth in Q2: ""More companies are entering the bitcoin space and an increasing number of real world uses for bitcoin are appearing, so there are many reasons to be bullish in Q2 2013. In a world of multi-trillion dollar payments and banking industries, the idea of a $10 billion virtual currency is not that far away.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/22/bitcoin-prices-yo-yo-in-q1,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424818,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWk5h,1366641256,Argentina trades $50k of bitcoins,"A record $50,000 of bitcoins were traded in Argentina during the second week of April.  Bitcoin's sixfold price increase this year is enticing to Argentines whose savings have been taking a hit from 25% annual inflation.  Local agent Rodolfo Andragnes said that while local trading of bitcoin still equals less than 0.1% of the almost $1 billion of Argentina’s foreign exchange transactions on a weekly basis, it has more than doubled since February.  ""Some Argentines are willing to take very risky investments and bet on this thing which feels almost like a Ponzi scheme because they feel their options locally are even more dangerous,” Claudio Loser told Bloomberg. A former director at the International Monetary Fund and current head of the Centennial Group Latin America research company, Loser continued, ""They don't see an easier way to save money.""  TradeHill Inc  ., the San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange, will open its first Latin American office in Argentina in the wake of surging demand for the digital currency in the region, according to Bloomberg.  In addition to feeling the pinch of high inflation, Argentines face strict limits on foreign exchange purchases. They are prohibited from buying US dollars except for travel and such currency exchanges must be approved by the government's tax agency.  Bitcoins appeal to Argentines as a way to transfer money outside of the country and trade for foreign currency when they're abroad, TradeHill's Jered Kenna told Bloomberg.  ""Argentina possibly has the most demand I've seen out of Latin America for bitcoins,"" he said. ""It provides a way to move money out of the country and avoid capital controls.""  Kenna is hoping to partner with a local bank in Argentina so he can open a bitcoin exchange there.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/22/argentina-trades-50k-of-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42424819,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWk9h,1366640916,Bitcoin faithful plan 2013 conferences,"As bitcoin continues to gather steam, the burgeoning conference circuit surrounding it continues to grow. This year sees at least two important conferences scheduled, each on either side of the Atlantic.  The Bitcoin Foundation is to run a conference from May 17-19 in San Jose, California. Scheduled sessions at Bitcoin 2013 will cover subjects including using bitcoin for business, improving the virtual currency's ease of use, and preventing fraud. Integrating the currency with existing financial systems, regulatory compliance, and legal classification are also on the agenda (which is downloadable as a PDF). There will also be a hackathon for lightning project development.  The Bitcoin Foundation was founded in September 2012 by Peter Vessenes, the founder of the CoinLab incubator for bitcoin projects in Seattle. The Foundation's goals including publishing a set of best practices around bitcoin use. It also hopes to create an opt-in certification programme for bitcoin-related businesses.  While Bitcoin 2013 promises to be purely bitcoin- and business-focused, another conference called unSystem will take a different approach. Scheduled for November 1-3 in Vienna, it promises to be more aligned with alternative culture, involving Occupy London, a ""privacy extremist"", the Anonymous hacktivist group and open-source guru Richard Stallman, among others. This conference is likely to span many non-bitcoin topics, too, based on last year's event. The 2012 unSystem conference, organised by activist bitcoin developer Amir Taaki, hosted several talks, which are viewable here.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/22/bitcoin-faithful-plan-2013-conferences,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
