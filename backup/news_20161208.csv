The digital currency, which powers the alternative ethereum blockchain, ethereum classic, came into existence in July amid a stream of enthusiasm. However, data suggests these high hopes have now fallen off.  CoinMarketCap  data reveals 24-hour trading volume repeatedly fall below $600,000 today, a figure that represented less than one-half of 1% of its all-time high of $155m reached on 3rd August.  Yet, the tepid trading volume represents a mere glimpse of the low transaction activity ethereum classic has experienced lately,  Over the last several weeks, 24-hour volume has repeatedly fallen below $600,000, even dropping to less than $150,000 on 20th November.

42379054,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr93,1481225442,"Toward Metropolis: After Blockchain Repairs, Ethereum Looks Ahead","Ethereum's developers are shifting focus.  Following efforts to make the blockchain-based distributed application network more resistant to attacks, two planned hard forks and one unintentional split, ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, at least, is turning his attention to a new milestone.  In a blog post this week, Buterin revealed he's now focusing his efforts on Metropolis, the next ""stage"" of the project (loosely scheduled for release in Q1 or Q2 2017).  The upcoming changes will clear the way for what Buterin calls ""abstraction"", or moving most of ethereum’s complex rules into its virtual machine as part of an effort to reduce the complexity of the system as a whole.  Analysts say the move would help realize long-planned features expected for integration in the network.  Blockchain consultant Ciaran Murray told CoinDesk:  ""'Abstraction' is probably the most defining philosophy of the ethereum community in my opinion.""  Metropolis, according to Murray, is about making ethereum as ""innovation-friendly"" as possible to developers, without compromising the security of the blockchain.  What to expect  Metropolis is the third in a series of four planned releases for the project, as originally envisioned. Currently in a phase called 'Homestead', the network was launched in July 2015 as part of a release dubbed 'Frontier'.  Buterin said that 'Metropolis', like the prior and current stages, will bring many small protocol improvements, ""which are altogether much more substantial than Homestead"".  The changes include the addition of two ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) first proposed in April.  The biggest perhaps is EIP 86, which would move ethereum's security logic into contracts so that developers have more control to experiment with different security schemes. EIP 96, in turn, helps to simplify client implementations.  One result of moving complex details out of the clients would be to make future hard forks safer, an upgrade that is increasingly relevant following a split in its community over such an issue earlier this year.  Another forward-looking example of abstraction, according to Murray, is for users to be able to pay for ethereum transaction fees with any cryptographic token, including bitcoin.  On the other hand, much-anticipated features such as proof-of-stake and sharding, are for now, not mentioned in the 'Metropolis' roadmap. Those are anticipated for inclusion in the final 'Serenity' release, which will also see the start of what Buterin has called 'Ethereum 2.0'.  Tensions ahead  One of the more notable metrics to watch for the project during this time will be sentiment – specifically, how well ethereum is able to keep pace with the expectations of its users.  A survey  conducted by CoinDesk Research earlier this year suggests this gap could become more pronounced after the excitement of initial launch this year.  For example, early 50% of respondents polled suggested they believed 'Casper', ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain and one of its foundational elements, was likely to be released in 2017.  Further, in an experimental environment, issues remain a possibility.  As an example of the difficulties inherent in any fork, Spurious Dragon, introduced last month, led to an unintentional fork because the two most popular ethereum clients implemented the new changes with slight differences.

42379051,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr7n,1481219052,Blockchain Voting Project Wins $10k Kapersky Labs Prize,"A blockchain voting project netted $10,000 in a recent contest organized by cybersecurity firm Kapersky Labs.  Dubbed Votebook, the proposed system connects voting machines via a private blockchain run by, say, a local elections authority. The Votebook concept would enable constituents to check that their votes were actually counted, according to the team, which hails from New York University.  As the team behind the project explained in their pitch, hosted on the website of The Economist:  “Votebook not only satisfies the requirements of an acceptable voting system, it is also realistically feasible immediately, with minimal disruption of voter expectations. We can and should harness the power of blockchain technology to serve democracy today.”  The idea of backing up voting records on a blockchain has long been cited as a potential use case, one previously highlighted during a speech by Delaware judge J Travis Laster. Even the local government in Moscow has been testing possible applications for blockchain-based voting.  A research paper  published in October by a think tank run by the EU Parliament also explored the concept, going as far as to propose that the bitcoin blockchain be used for this purpose by tying votes to transactions on the network.

42379049,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mr6X,1481214035,Japan Could Drop 8% Bitcoin Sales Tax By Mid-2017,"Japan’s plan to drop an 8% sales tax on bitcoin purchases could take effect as early as July 2017, according to documents obtained by CoinDesk.  Though subject to final approval by senior Japanese government officials, an annual tax document prepared by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito party and published today offers new details on a proposal floated in October by the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency.  The tax remains in place today. Yet if approved by the Cabinet, the plan would institute a grace period in June of next year, with the tax exemption becoming official the following month. The document release is the culmination of discussions between government stakeholders first reported by regional news service Nikkei.  Bitcoin startups in Japan have responded positively to the move.  Mike Kayamori, CEO of exchange service Quoine, said that the plan to drop the sales tax was expected but represents a “good message to the crypto-currency community”.  He told CoinDesk:  “It’s a huge relief for us. Customers don’t have to pay tax for each transaction. Hope this becomes standard practice.”  The move caps a busy year in Japan on the exchange front, as the government moved to mandate registration requirements on companies handling bitcoin sales in the country.  Discussions around exchange regulation began in late 2015 between government ministers, who mulled ways to gather information from exchange services. a The deliberations took place within the context of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that imploded in early 2014, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost customer funds.

42379065,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mrGb,1481209510,Inside 'Spark': Circle's New Bitcoin-Powered Smart Contract Platform,"If you needed another sign that we're living in a multi-blockchain world, Circle's latest product reveal might have been it.  Overshadowed by the clamor surrounding the startup's decision to end consumer bitcoin services, it was almost lost that it announced it would soon open-source a smart contracts platform it described as an ""evolution"" of its core transaction processing.  Called 'Spark', Circle's new tech isn't a blockchain or a new cryptocurrency. Rather, as explained by the company, it uses a combination of bitcoin, other blockchains and traditional settlement rails to further its mission of promoting a global, social payments platform.  Still, Circle co-founder and president Sean Neville explained that, for all the backlash the company has so far received, Spark doesn't exactly mark a shift in its vision so much as a refinement of how it will execute on it.  Neville told CoinDesk:  ""Our primary product experience [is] a global social payment experience that spans all borders. That experience still uses Spark in the background, and Spark still uses bitcoin in the background.”  In other words, transactions would still settle in bitcoin, though Spark could also allow Circle and its money transfer partners to use other networks, whether that’s a separate blockchain network (like ethereum) or a traditional card settlement network (like ACH).  ""Bitcoin can be used with Spark today, and other distributed ledgers can also be plugged into it. Traditional private systems can also be added as integrations,"" he said.  As explained by Neville, the company has (and continues to see) bitcoin as a protocol more akin to TCP/IP, one of the lower-level, foundational Internet protocols. (He compared Spark to a HTTPS, a top-level protocol that relies on TCP/IP as a base layer).  In this light, Neville described Spark as an application designed to run on top of any blockchain or distributed ledger, stating that it could even be compatible with permissioned blockchain technologies such as IBM's Fabric or R3's newly introduced Corda system.  Neville suggested that this increased functionality would perhaps better allow its transfer network expand to serve more consumers.  ""We are still using bitcoin. We still trade in it, and use it to support the global consumer payment service we're offering. We're just no longer supporting the buying and selling of it as an exchange product,"" Neville said.  New additions  So, what's missing from the bitcoin protocol?  In Circle’s view, Neville said that Spark is designed for payments firms that would want to use bitcoin to transfer money. This means it offers extra tools designed for know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and exchange rate negotiation.  ""Spark includes protocols and support for workflow rules, identity, regulatory compliance and exchange rate information, among other things, that we've added to support settlement on blockchains and other rails,"" he continued.  Neville said that Circle had hoped the official bitcoin software would perhaps one day be designed with these features, but that he understands that they don't fit into bitcoin's roadmap and why they shouldn't be included or prioritized in the protocol.  Nonetheless, in statements to The Wall Street Journal, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expanded on this critique, asserting that the lack of governance around bitcoin software management was also a factor in influencing its decision.  ""We've been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward,"" Allaire told the news source.  Network effect  The added functionality also hints at the design behind Spark.  Faced with the prospect of competing against established firms such as PayPal or Venmo, Circle's decision to embrace a platform that could expand on the current bitcoin network, as part of a way to include more banks and FinTech firms, is perhaps not surprising.  In statements to CoinDesk, Circle spoke in similarly broad strokes, calling Spark a ""public protocol and API"" and an alternative to traditional settlement.  For example, should Circle users want to transfer money to the Philippines, Circle would turn the original funds into bitcoin, which would then be sent overseas to a partner firm like Coins, that would then provide local currency.  As such, Neville was keen to stress that Spark intends to be an ""open source project"" one that it will seek to manage collaboratively with partners focused on money transfer.  As shown in CoinDesk's Q3 State of Blockchain report, there may be added pressures behind the move given the lack of new bitcoin exchanges seeing investment.  Over the course of 2016, investment in infrastructure-layer bitcoin companies (such as exchanges and wallets) has been on the decline, a trend that has extended to new blockchain networks, with existing bitcoin exchanges extending to new markets.

42379063,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mrJ7,1481205356,"Relax Lawyers, Nick Szabo Says Smart Contracts Won't Kill Jobs","No, smart contracts will not rid the world of lawyers, despite the greatest efforts of blockchain innovators. At least, that's according to Nick Szabo, the man widely credited with inventing the smart contract concept itself.  During the keynote address at the Smart Contracts Symposium at Microsoft's New York headquarters this week, Szabo gave an update on the industry he helped create – a talk that was followed by a string of commenters from smart contract professionals.  Addressing a group of about 250 people (comprised largely of members of the blockchain trade association, the Chamber of Digital Commerce), Szabo broke down the potential benefits and what he sees as the current limits of self-executing code run on a cryptographic, shared ledger.  Szabo said:  ""Lawyers worried about losing their jobs to robots, you're actually doing something that's mostly complimentary to a smart contract. Smart contracts are mostly making possible new things that haven’t been done before.""  Crucial differences between traditional contracts and smart contracts are that the logic in traditional law is based on the ""subjective"" interpretation of analogy, according to Szabo. On the other hand, blockchain smart contracts are based on Boolean ""bits and logic"" that underpin bitcoin.  There are also differences on the global scale, he went on.  While traditional law falls into ""jurisdictional silos"" defined by state borders and other lines of demarcation, blockchain-powered contract law has the potential to exist across borders.  The result is that while traditional law is relatively flexible, involving interpretation and judgment (and can therefore be corrupted), a software version is ""rigid and predictable"".  ""Traditional law is manual, local and often uncertain,"" said Szabo, who is also the co-founder of cryptographic assets firm, Global Financial Access. ""Public blockchains are automated, global and predicable in their operations.""  While the jobs of lawyers may be safe for now, other professions might not be so lucky.  Creative destruction  In fact, smart contract law is so different from traditional law that, instead of lawyers' jobs being at risk, it's those in other industries with repeatable tasks with the most to lose.  Speaking on a panel covering smart contract platforms and applications, Marley Gray, Microsoft principle architect in charge of blockchain engineering, said that smart contracts elevate the ""distributed resolution of the truth"" first enabled by the bitcoin blockchain.  For contract designers dealing in this new distributed way of reconciling such complex processes, the hard part will be to not get trapped into thinking in terms of encoding existing processes into a blockchain, Gray said.  ""People have a hard time unlearning what they’ve been brought up to do,"" he explained. ""Sometimes the best thing to do is completely destroy a business process.""  Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik echoed the notion that business workflows need to be entirely reinvented from the ground up.  But he took the idea further, arguing that the reimagined workflow won't just impact how businesses function internally, but how they do business with each other.  ""Blockchain is adjudication as a service,"" said Garzik, a former BitPay employee. ""It validates rules that are common to the entire playing field. It's very much a hyper-real-time version of the court system.""  IBM fellow and vice president of blockchain technologies Jerry Cuomo summarized the push to reimagine business workflows far beyond law:  ""When folks really start to step back and think about business processes as a decentralized sport, as a team sport, it completely changes the possibilities of how you do a KYC and AML.""  Language choice  While smart contracts are in their earliest phases of development, large-scale failures have helped to define issues that should be avoided.  In addition to Szabo's review of the state of smart contracts, he discussed the forward to a white paper published that day and distributed to event attendees, titled ""Smart Contracts: 12 Use Cases for Business & Beyond"".  Prepared by the Smart Contracts Alliance, an initiative of the Chamber in collaboration with Deloitte, the paper describes smart contract implementations ranging from the automatic compliance of the destruction of records to instantaneous processing of auto insurance.  The paper positions smart contracts on a spectrum ranging from contracts ""entirely” written in code to ""natural language"" contracts with encoded payment mechanisms.  To Szabo, the safest way to execute such contracts would be the bitcoin blockchain, which he called the ""most reliable financial system that’s ever been deployed"".  In spite of the current limitations of the bitcoin network for supporting smart contracts, in Szabo's forward to the white paper he described his ideal smart contract deployment as rather complimentary to its current abilities:  ""My personal favorite and most exciting type of smart contract is constructed in peer-to-peer environments, from simple natural language by individuals to operate between individuals.""

42379042,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7mqxj,1481202447,Mizuho Bank Weighs Digital Currency Services Offering,"Mizuho Bank is weighing possible client-facing services after testing a prototype digital currency in partnership with IBM Japan.  The project, first announced in June, saw the Japanese bank and IBM’s local division test the digital currency, one unit of which equals one yen.  According to Nikkei, the initiative took place between July and September, focusing on an app that provided information about dining expenses and used the prototype currency as a basis.  Other Japanese financial institutions, including Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), have tested the concept of digital money in the past. Mizuho itself has also experimented with a range of applications since February.  This year also saw a group of domestic banks conduct an exploration of interbank payments via blockchain, the results of which were published last week.  With the Mizuho initiative, the goal was to see whether the bank could improve its transaction-monitoring capabilities and cut any costs associated with moving funds.  As IBM said at the time:  “Using its own virtual currency that trades 1:1 with the Yen in a secure environment could potentially provide better tracking and control of the exchange of funds, and eliminate some of the expenses associated with the exchange of paper-based currency.”  From here, Mizuho is planning to assess whether the IBM-backed digital currency trial could lead to new kinds of services for its clients, according to Nikkei. However, security concerns will reportedly play a role in those deliberations.

At press time, the price of bitcoin was up again around the $770-mark, a development that may be surprising given the news a major startup, Circle Internet Financial, would no longer provide customers with the ability to buy and sell the digital currency.  The announcement, made yesterday through The Wall Street Journal, has so far had little effect on the digital currency.  Bitcoin prices reached $768.32 at 20:15 UTC yesterday, coming within roughly 1.3% of the June annual high of $781.31, according to CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Even after rising to this daily high of near $770, bitcoin fell short of the five-month high of $778.14 reached 2nd December.  Circle had generated significant visibility for being one of the best-funded early bitcoin startups, raising $136m.  In June, the startup raised $60 million through a Series D funding round, a development that coincided with Circle announcing the creation of its China-based subsidiary, Circle China.  The firm has now said it will focus on a new proprietary blockchain-based protocol called Spark, an unreleased technology that will use bitcoin to move money across borders.
