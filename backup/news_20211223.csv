13221586,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=479703,1640303968,"It’s Not You, It’s Crypto: Execs Leave Silicon Valley To Join Crypto Startups","A few years ago it was an executives&apos; dream to work at Google, Amazon, Apple, and the other Big Tech firms of Silicon Valley, but now that dream has evolved into crypto startups. Whether it is to join a blockchain-related company or start a new one, high-paying executives and engineers are leaving the valley of big salaries and CEOs at an accelerating rate. The New York Times reported the exodus of Big Tech executives and the boom of crypto products like NFTs is seen as a possible reason for it. But if the fantasy of Silicon Valley talent used to be that cushy position involving good money, what do crypto firms represent to them now? Could it still be just about money? Big companies like Google are getting worried about keeping the talent in. Allegedly, they have started to offer additional stock grants for the employees who are likely to choose a crypto startup over them, although the company refused to comment for the paper. Evan Cheng, co-founder and chief executive of a blockchain-related startup called Mysten Labs, commented about the change of hearts: &apos;Back in 2017 or so, people were mostly in it for the investment opportunity,&apos; and added that &apos;Now it&apos;s people actually wanting to build stuff.&apos; Execs Are Silicon Valley&apos;s Exes Here are some of the executives that have broken the Big Tech guys frozen hearts: Sandy Carter used to be Amazons&apos; vice president, now she&apos;s Senior Vice President and Channel ...",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/its-not-you-its-crypto-execs-leave-silicon-valley-to-join-crypto-startups/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: The crypto market cheers for a “Santa rally” as bitcoin crossed a key price level at $50,000.  Technician’s take (Editor’s note): Technician’s Take is taking a holiday hiatus. In its place, First Mover Asia is publishing the third in a series of stories on the year in cryptocurrency markets by CoinDesk markets analyst Damanick Dantes and Managing Editor of Markets Brad Keoun.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $50,691 +3.9%  Ether (ETH): $4,104 +2.8%  Markets  S&P 500: $4,725 +0.6%  DJIA: $35,950 +0.5%  Nasdaq: $15,653 +0.8%  Gold: $1,808 +0.2%  Market moves  Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, on Thursday broke above $50,000 for the first time since Dec. 13. Major U.S. stock indexes also rose amid improving U.S consumer sentiment in December.  Trading volume, meanwhile, was low two days before Christmas. Data compiled by CoinDesk showed that bitcoin’s trading volume across major centralized exchanges was only slightly higher than a day ago.  Other cryptocurrencies followed bitcoin’s bullish move: Ether’s price rose above $4,100 on Thursday, up over 3% over the past 24 hours.  Crypto Twitter cheered for a so-called Santa rally for bitcoin. The oldest cryptocurrency by market capitalization struggled for more than a week to move above $50,000, while other alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins) such as LUNA and MATIC rallied to record highs.  Year-end market wrap  Market Wrap Year-End Review: Bitcoin Peaks as Coinbase Goes Public: Tesla’s bitcoin acceptance helped to send the BTC price to an all-time high near $65,000 in April, almost unthinkable just a few months earlier. Coinbase’s direct stock listing marked the exact date of the market top. ((by Damanick Dantes and Brad Keoun)  Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest digital-asset prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  In Tuesday’s episode, we documented the social-media craze that fueled price rallies in bitcoin and dogecoin in January and February. Today, we’ll show how Tesla’s involvement in bitcoin sent prices even higher in February and March. There was hype and ebullience leading up to the U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase’s direct stock listing in April, but the rally quickly fizzled.  From Tesla to Coinbase, bitcoin went up, then down  The bitcoin price broke above $50,000 in February after Tesla disclosed it had invested $1.5 billion into BTC.  The market reaction inspired a bit of opportunism on the part of one enterprising T-shirt vendor, who rushed to offer a T-shirt for $19.99 with the words “Elon’s Candle,” referring to the electric vehicle maker’s billionaire CEO, Elon Musk. The “candle” referred to the dramatic pattern that appeared on bitcoin’s price chart as a result of the Musk-fueled price pop:  In March, Musk ratcheted up the drama with a tweet stating that consumers can “now buy a Tesla with bitcoin.”     The announcements helped propel bitcoin, the oldest cryptocurrency, toward a previously unthinkable $1 trillion market capitalization for the first time.  But from a professional price chart reader’s perspective, bitcoin appeared to be “overbought;” that term meant the market’s run-up had probably gone too far, too fast and wasn’t justified by the underlying level of buying interest at the new, elevated threshold.  Once again, bitcoin turned lower – dropping back to its 50-day moving price average of around $30,000. Apparently, it was a level where buyers once again appeared to grow interested.  The market stabilization offered a signal to traders: Bitcoin appeared to hold above the price where it had started 2021, at $29,112. That was cause for renewed optimism.  So as news headlines in traditional financial media and breathless commentators began to highlight the upcoming direct stock listing of Coinbase, the biggest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, the bitcoin rally resumed.  Over the coming months, the price would more than double, a reminder of just how volatile cryptocurrency markets can be.  Coinbase goes public  On April 14, Coinbase, the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, went live with its direct stock listing on the Nasdaq exchange, under the ticker symbol COIN.  “This is a watershed moment for the digital-asset industry, as it signifies a larger moment of credibility for a market that is maturing rapidly,” Hunter Merghart, head of U.S. for rival cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp, told CoinDesk in an interview.  The initial trading price for the COIN stock, at $381, was an impressive 52% above the reference price of $250 a share published a day earlier by the Nasdaq. But even that lofty price level was well below some of the price targets issued recently by stock analysts, with some estimates ranging as high as $600 a share.  The failure of COIN shares to push even higher suddenly seemed, well, deflating for a crypto market that had grown accustomed to prices constantly going higher.  By the end of the first day of trading, COIN’s stock price had dropped to $342.  The fading spirits spilled over into the bitcoin market: It turned out the hotly anticipated public trading debut of the cryptocurrency exchange wasn’t enough to sustain the twofold price rise in BTC over the prior couple of months.  Bitcoin stalled near an all-time high of around $64,800 on April 14 and quickly went into a sharp sell-off. The chart below shows slowing price momentum, defined by lower highs in the daily relative strength index (RSI), which typically precedes a decline in price.  The hotly anticipated COIN direct listing ended up being a classic “buy the rumor, sell the fact” event. In hindsight, the date of the Coinbase IPO would coincide with bitcoin’s top.  For seasoned crypto traders and newbies alike, the episode offered a fresh lesson in how even sky-high price predictions, euphoric rallies and milestones like the Coinbase direct stock listing do eventually come head to head with the reality of fickle and notoriously cryptocurrency markets, and down-to-earth valuations.

42389899,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6kSJ,1640296839,Japan’s Taxes on Crypto Firms Are Leading Some to Leave the Country,"Crypto companies in Japan have implored authorities to change tax policies that some say are driving them out of the country. Recent government policy announcements indicate their calls are unheeded.  On Dec. 10, Japan’s ruling coalition approved a tax plan for the 2022 fiscal year that continues to treat token listings as taxable. Once tokens are listed on an active market, issuers are liable to pay tax even if they don’t sell.  A project that lists some of its tokens on exchanges and keeps the rest in its treasury also has to pay taxes on what it holds if its market value goes up.  If the core team doesn’t have the funds to pay the taxes, as is often the case with early-stage startups, it is forced to sell more tokens to public markets. This adversely affects both the token price and the overall health and trajectory of the project.  Certified tax accountant Kenji Yanagisawa told CoinDesk that the tax rate for the token issuer is around 35%.  If a token issuer airdrops a token, both the issuer and the recipient are taxed.  The current taxation regime “will not change for at least another year,” Yanagisawa said.  Brain drain  Japan’s corporate tax policy has driven crypto project founders to dissolve their entities in Japan and move to other countries.  Mai Fujimoto, founder of Gracone, a blockchain and cryptocurrency consulting company, said that she knows of eight projects that have moved away from Japan.  One of these is the Astar Network, a multi-chain decentralized application (dapp) hub founded by Sota Watanabe. Unclear regulation and high taxes are a “severe problem in Japan,” Watanabe told CoinDesk.  Tokens are taxed once they are listed on an active market, but there is no clear definition of an active market, he said.  Listing on a top exchange like Binance almost undoubtedly constitutes an active market, but it is unclear whether listing on a decentralized exchange or an exchange with low trading volume would count as one, he said.  In July, Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) announced the launch of a decentralized finance (DeFi) study group chaired by Hideki Kanda, a jurist and law professor at Gakushuin University. Most of the members are legal scholars, with the exception of the chief technology officer of LayerX and an executive from Sony.  Watanabe created an entity in Singapore in October 2020 and dissolved his Japanese entity in 2021. He said that this cost roughly $200,000 in legal and accounting fees.  He has also set up a program to help other Japanese crypto companies migrate to Singapore. He plans to issue tokens in Singapore and send feedback to the Japanese government on how hard or “almost impossible” it is to do Web 3 projects with native tokens in Japan, including concrete numbers on valuations and token holders.  Some entrepreneurs cite the lack of supporting policies to grow the domestic blockchain industry as an additional reason for their departure.  Leona Hioki, CEO of Ryodan Systems AG, had thought that Japan might encourage a homegrown crypto industry “like China did for the Internet industry.”  “My expectations seem wrong,” he said. He left for Switzerland this year, describing it as “neither [an] extreme tax haven nor a crypto chaos jungle,” noting that in Zug, companies can pay taxes with bitcoin.  Market outflow  Currently, gains for crypto investors fall under miscellaneous income. Tax rates on crypto gains depend on individual income but the highest earners can be taxed up to 55%.  In comparison, the tax rate for stock gains is about 20% for individuals.  “Japanese tax regulation is crazy and wrong,” Genki Oda, president of crypto exchange BITPoint, told CoinDesk. If the authorities were to make the tax law on crypto equivalent to that of stocks, he estimated that 10 trillion to 20 trillion yen (US$88 billion to $175 billion) would return to Japan’s crypto markets.  There is some engagement between government and founders. Watanabe is a task force member of the Trusted Web Promotion Council, which is led by Japan’s Cabinet Secretariat. He said the group “would like to push innovation” but financial authorities like the FSA are “very conservative” due to notable hacks of Japanese exchanges.  When he issued a token in Japan, though he did not list the token on an active market, he received two letters from the FSA enquiring as to how it worked.  According to Watanabe, Japan lost to the U.S. in internet, mobile and cars, and is losing in a lot of electrical appliances to China and South Korea.  “Web 3, blockchain and crypto [are] going to be the next big movement,” Watanabe said. “We’re going to lose [again] if we don’t change the law on tax.”  What regulators want  The Japan Cryptoasset Business Association (JCBA) have been advocating for lower crypto taxes over the last few years.  In spring of this year, the FSA proactively approached JCBA to discuss crypto taxation for the first time, which JCBA viewed as a step forward.  Seiji Yuki, JCBA managing director, explained that many lawmakers want to see compelling use cases for cryptocurrencies before revising regulation.  He said that some local governments of small cities and villages have approached JCBA about doing initial exchange offerings, to offset their decreasing tax revenue.  “They [politicians and lawmakers] need us to find actual business cases,” said Takeshi Chino, managing director of Kraken Japan.  He said regulators do not see any justification for promoting crypto due to its high volatility. In their view, the crypto market only attracts speculators, not real investors who hold assets for a long time.  If there were more cases of local governments in Japan collaborating with a blockchain company to issue a cryptocurrency, more politicians might be curious about cryptocurrency and support changing the tax regime, he said.  “It’s a chicken and egg problem,” Watanabe said. “The Japanese government needs use cases to change the law. But without changing the law, it’s extremely tough to create use cases.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,"Lavender Au, Eliza Gkritsi",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/23/japans-taxes-on-crypto-firms-are-leading-some-to-leave-the-country,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png

Las Vegas-based Marathon did not disclose a total but claimed that in terms of exahashes per second (EX/s) the new machines will generate, the deal was the largest single order of Antminer S19 XP bitcoin miners ever from Bitmain.  Following earlier purchases this year, Marathon expects to have 199,000 operational miners generating 23.3 EH/s by early 2023, a 600% hashrate increase from current levels, the company confirmed to CoinDesk.  The fast-growing miner revised predictions from autumn when it expected to have 133,000 operational miners generating 13.3 EH/s by mid-2022.  As of Dec. 1, Marathon had 31,000 operational miners, producing 3.2 EX/s.  At the time of publication, Marathon Digital shares were up nearly 12% in Thursday trading.  Marathon has made multiple large purchases of miners this year, and in October it secured a $100 million revolving line of credit with Silvergate Bank in bitcoin and U.S. dollars. The miner said it would use the loan to fund bitcoin mining operations and to acquire new equipment.  “Given the strength of our balance sheet and our asset-light model, which allows us to invest our capital into mining machines rather than infrastructure, we were uniquely positioned to place the largest single order of S19 XPs, in terms of total hash rate, Bitmain has ever received,” Marathon CEO Fred Thiel said in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING,James Rubin,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/23/marathon-digital-to-expand-hashrate-by-600-with-record-purchase-of-bitcoin-miners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f92615fd4194b95abcd742aa08fa223c6ed55fe5-1600x900.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42389912,89WXKWUN1T5QFoffyf6khc,1640294127,Market Wrap Year In Review: Remembering Bitcoin’s FUD-Fueled Crash,"Hello, Market Wrap readers! During the final two weeks of 2021, we’re using this space to recap the year’s most dramatic moments in cryptocurrency markets – and highlight the key lessons from this fast-evolving corner of global finance. Over a series of eight posts starting on Dec. 20 and running through Dec. 30, we’ll recap what shook crypto markets this year. (For the latest digital-asset prices and news headlines, please scroll down.)  On Wednesday, we recapped how Tesla’s bitcoin acceptance and Coinbase’s direct listing helped send bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high near $65,000, which turned out, in hindsight, to be the market peak. Today, we’ll show how some traders and investors began to cash out in April and May as concerns mounted over U.S. capital gains taxes, bitcoin’s environmental footprint and an outright crypto ban in China. It seemed like the fear, uncertainty and doubt – FUD, or crypto-speak for negative news – was coming all at once.  Tax selling  All it took was a New York Times headline in mid-April that U.S. President Joe Biden was planning to roughly double the tax on capital gains or proceeds earned from selling assets – with provisions deemed unfriendly toward cryptocurrencies – to end hopes of a rally back toward bitcoin’s all-time high near $65,000. After a powerful bull run earlier in the year, bitcoin’s price decline suddenly accelerated.  “The cryptocurrency was already on the defensive,” Pankaj Balani, co-founder and CEO of the Singapore-based Delta Exchange, told CoinDesk in an email at the time. “The tax news invited more profit taking.”  “The U.S. actions were not bullish for bitcoin, as tax increases could be a thorn in the recovery and will drag down investments,” Edward Moya, analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange brokerage firm, wrote in an email.  Some analysts pointed to a stronger U.S. dollar as a potential headwind for bitcoin (BTC). Warmer weather was coming in the Northern Hemisphere, and more coronavirus vaccines were getting distributed around the world, leading to a sunnier economic outlook. It appeared as though the U.S. was on its way to improving the budget deficit, which widened during the pandemic stimulus program.  All that meant there might be less need for extra economic support from governments and central banks, which had bolstered bitcoin’s attractiveness among investors as a possible hedge against fast inflation.  Environmental concerns  But bitcoin had other problems. In the months ahead, many investors in traditional markets – perceived as a key target for mainstream cryptocurrency adoption – would start to question the cryptocurrency’s environmental footprint – due to the blockchain network’s heavy electricity usage.  Tesla’s billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, for example, mad a U-turn from his earlier bullish stance on bitcoin and decided to no longer accept BTC as payment for his company’s electric cars, citing concerns about the use of fossil fuels in crypto mining.  Musk’s tweet triggered an immediate 6% drop in the bitcoin price. Suddenly, the environment became front and center as an impediment in the 12-year-old cryptocurrency’s path to becoming a widely acceptable asset class. And with environmental, social and governance (ESG) becoming the new buzzwords on Wall Street, it became harder to convince big money managers that energy-intensive bitcoin was a good addition to portfolios.  For example, a survey of 600 people in the fund management industry found that 96% expected their firms to increase prioritization of ESG during 2021. John Reed Stark, former chief of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Internet Enforcement, told CoinDesk’s Lyllah Ledesma in May that the bitcoin ESG concerns would certainly dampen institutional investment in crypto.  China’s crypto ban  And just when bitcoin traders thought they had seen enough of the fear, uncertainty and doubt, China officially banned all financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.  China had been banning things related to crypto since 2013, but the fresh crackdown made it clear that crypto trading activity involved “legal risks” and that “any legal person, unincorporated organization or natural person” investing in virtual currency and related derivatives was violating “public order and good customs,” CoinDesk’s Muyao Shen reported.  News of the China ban sent bitcoin sharply lower, which left the price down roughly 50% from the April record near $65,000. By almost any definition, the bitcoin market had entered a new, bearish phase.  The China-related sell-off wiped $400 billion off the crypto market, which encouraged some “whales” – large BTC holders – to move their coins onto exchanges for sale. Crypto markets were in panic mode.  It also dawned on investors just how vulnerable cryptocurrencies were to regulatory risk. Whether it was concerns about capital gains taxes or the outright crypto ban in China, bitcoin’s euphoric rise appeared stunted by the increased scrutiny from governments and supervisors of the traditional financial system.  More work would be needed before environmentally conscious investors would start piling into bitcoin.  In Monday’s episode of this year-in-review series, we’ll feature one institutional investor who planned a bitcoin exit right around the price top.

42410926,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggtSRc,1640289446,What Jack Dorsey’s Beef With 'Web 3' Is Really About,"Since officially leaving Twitter, now full-time Block (formerly Square) CEO Jack Dorsey has become immensely more vocal and opinionated about blockchain and cryptocurrency debates. That’s a really great way to get entangled in extremely heated online fights – and wouldn’t you know it, Dorsey’s aggressive dismissal of Web 3 as nothing more than a venture capitalist (VC) enrichment scheme has turned into a vicious airing of grievances, just in time for Festivus.  But many new entrants who have become interested in crypto over the past two years are left scratching their heads. Web 3 is about blockchain, somehow, right? And Bitcoin is a blockchain – so why are Mom and Dad fighting?  Well, young ‘un, therein lies the long tale of a great feud. Think Capulets versus Montagues. Hatfields versus McCoys. Harkonnen versus Atreides.  Add to the list of history’s most intransigent clan-on-clan grudges: Bitcoin versus crypto.  Bitcoin vs. Web 3  We’ll get to the question of why Dorsey thinks VCs control Web 3, but first we have to back up quite a bit. The Dorsey blowup is a high-profile eruption of a fight that has been raging pretty much constantly since 2013, if not earlier, and has really heated up since the 2014 unveiling of Ethereum.  On one side of this debate is a loose alliance sometimes confusingly referred to by insiders like Dorsey as “crypto,” but which might be more accurately dubbed “Ethereans” – not because they all use or build on Ethereum specifically, but because basically all of these systems broadly mimic or parallel what Ethereum does. These are the folks behind the recent explosion in innovations like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), play-to-earn gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – and very notably, decentralized social media, which Twitter began working on when Dorsey was CEO.  These applications largely rely on “smart contracts,” lines of code that live on blockchains and set the terms for transparent, irreversible and open-access transactions. As part of these structures, smart contract-based projects often require their own unique token to use, and these make up a large portion of the crypto market on exchanges like Coinbase. “Web 3″ is, very roughly, the idea that the web should integrate more smart contract applications, and their various tokens. NFTs aren’t inherently reliant on smart contracts, but they’ve become deeply enmeshed in this ecosystem, and they’re now a large part of the pitch for both Web 3 and the metaverse.  And yes, Web 3 and the metaverse are structurally synonymous. Both at their core are about building front-end interfaces and systems that use blockchain assets, which can be shared across a variety of these front ends. That includes things like having NFT-based game assets usable in a variety of games, or tokens that unlock a variety of services.  (This is what makes Facebook rebranding itself Meta and claiming to build “the metaverse” such terminal, drooling idiocy, if not an act of outright malice. It’s just as comically thickskulled as a company claiming to build “the blockchain.” I mean, it’s right there in the name: “Meta,” derived from Greek, means “beyond” or “transcending,” in this case as in “transcending any single iteration of a virtual world.” Interoperability is inherent to the metaverse, and what Facebook is building will be at best be a shard of something much larger – though knowing Facebook, it will much more likely be a walled garden that smears on just enough metaverse-colored greasepaint to hustle the rubes.)  Bitcoin bites back  On the other side of this Stalin versus Trotsky barroom brawl are Bitcoiners like Dorsey. This loose but passionate faction believes that the original cryptocurrency is also the best cryptocurrency, or maybe even the only legitimate one. The most extreme Bitcoiners are known as “Bitcoin Maximalists,” and they essentially believe that Bitcoin’s sturdiness and universality will make it a shared global currency, with democratized access benefiting humanity as a whole.  Maximalists (though not all Bitcoiners) also believe that other cryptos are a threat to that vision (“an attack on Bitcoin,” as they often put it), primarily because of their compromises on decentralization. Some Maximalists feel that opposing other cryptos justifies, let’s say, a wide diversity of rhetorical tactics. Their willingness to go for the figurative throat has often led to Bitcoiners being tarred as “toxic,” probably one reason the backlash to Dorsey’s comments has itself been so heated.  While advocates are still working to define the precise benefits of “Web 3,” Bitcoiners have concise bullet points for the benefits of truly decentralized cryptocurrencies: extreme data security (you can’t hack the Bitcoin network), censorship resistance (anyone can use Bitcoin and nobody can stop any transaction by technical means), privacy (though not necessarily secrecy), and trustlessness. Trustlessness means that the system abides by reliable and transparent rules that no individual, entity or small consortium can change unilaterally. With Bitcoin, any changes require genuine mass consensus among developers, miners and nodes (though bitcoin holders basically have no say, apart from selling if they don’t like the way things are going).  The prerequisite for all those nice things is the core feature that Bitcoiners argue defines a “real” blockchain: true and full decentralization. This is a crucial distinction: Decentralization isn’t in and of itself a virtue or a goal; it’s a thing you must have to get the features unique to public blockchains. That also means, somewhat confusingly, that there are a handful of other truly decentralized cryptos that even the most hardened Maximalists can at the very least tolerate. One example is Monero, a privacy token that has one of the wildest community-driven origin stories ever.  The test case for the importance of decentralization is pretty simple: If a very powerful government wanted to shut down or interfere with a particular blockchain, how many people or machines would they have to compromise to do it?  Bitcoiners look at Ethereum-style “crypto” and smart contracts and see tradeoffs in decentralization and security for the sake of throughput or features – what is sometimes derided as “decentralization theater.” This is largely targeted at proof-of-stake and other alternative consensus mechanisms, but even Ethereum itself, in its current proof-of-work iteration, gets knocked on this point: Bitcoiners argue that its structure makes independent nodes onerous to create and maintain, increasing centralization and fragility.  Though it didn’t directly involve smart contracts, the same argument was central to the “Block Size War” of 2015-2017, when a faction seeking faster transactions proposed making Bitcoin nodes similarly hefty. That battle also cemented another major Bitcoiner argument: that a diversity of cryptocurrencies, even those that are technologically similar to Bitcoin itself, threatens the growth of the crypto ecosystem because it splinters interest into a variety of factions. Some moderate Bitcoiners reject this critique, though, arguing that so-called “altcoins” can be useful test beds for future Bitcoin features.  But basically all Bitcoiners are extremely skeptical of the involvement of for-profit entities in creating new tokens, arguing in part that such a role inherently compromises the decentralization of systems because there’s either a centralized entity able to make their own changes to the system, or a clear target for government pressure to censor a system. See for example the stablecoins USDT and USDC, whose administrators, Tether and Circle respectively, have the power to block any blacklisted user, or seize their funds. (You can see for yourself on the blockchain, here and here.)  Dorsey’s critique of VCs’ role in Web 3 is focused on the financial implications of VC-backed blockchains, arguing that they inevitably siphon money away from users and basically wind up as landlords on their own systems. But that argument is somewhat downstream from the centralization critique.  Who actually needs Web 3?  So on the one side, you have a complex, experimental, and arguably fragile Etherean ecosystem that provides the exciting new features that advocates want to see democratized through Web 3. On the other side, you have Dorsey and the Bitcoiners saying those cool applications rely on systems that are inadequately decentralized to gain the fundamental benefits of a blockchain, in part because those compromises help make the systems’ backers rich.  But the excluded middle here is that a lot of what’s touted as the promise of Web 3 is either impossible or very difficult to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s decentralization and bombproof security come at the expense of storage space, features and, most of all, transaction speed. If you’re playing a metaverse or Web 3 game, you don’t want to wait ten minutes or more for a confirmation that your new sword has arrived.  To be fair, some Web 3 features appear possible through layers built on top of Bitcoin. Hiro, formerly Blockstack PBC, is building smart contracts using Bitcoin, and the potential for rough functional equivalents to NFTs and Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens (sort of) has existed on Bitcoin in the form of “colored coins” since around 2012.  But it seems unlikely that Bitcoin itself could support these applications at the scale and speed Web 3 advocates have in mind, even using layer 2s. At the same time, Bitcoin’s robust decentralization was achieved under a set of circumstances that is unlikely to ever be reproduced, especially after the regulatory crackdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs) starting in 2018.  So Dorsey’s knock on VCs’ role in Web 3 would seem to back him into a corner: It’s unclear that there are alternative routes to funding and building the Web 3 vision. The unspoken implication of Dorsey’s attacks seems to be that the Web 3 vision being bandied about should be either entirely rejected, or scaled back to something that can be accomplished on Bitcoin. Which, again, is a bit strange coming from a man who has sold NFTs and invested in decentralized social media.  That’s not to discount specific critiques of how VCs invest in new crypto tokens. There are some serious problems with presale discounts and short lockup periods for token launches, which really do often amount to VCs dumping their bags on retail investors without a care in the world for whether the idea or technology behind the token are any good. Those issues desperately need to be addressed, though it’s also worth noting that they aren’t entirely crypto-specific. VCs have been getting preferential insider terms for decades.  But in his Bitcoiner ferocity, Dorsey may have missed the subtler compromise position that is relatively common in the crypto industry. Everyone who’s really paying attention recognizes that Bitcoin is a rock-solid and transformative technology – but many also keep their minds open to the idea that less cosmically robust systems may have real applications and benefits, too. Do you really need an entirely censorship-resistant blockchain to manage profile pic NFTs or your multiverse robe and wizard hat? Do purpose-built blockchains like Flow really threaten Bitcoin?  Those are genuine questions. This entire sector is still very, very new: Ethereum only launched six years ago! So a lot of people are suspending judgment and letting the chips fall where they may. Wherever you land, though, it may be healthy to nurture a little Bitcoin Maximalist to live on your right shoulder. Let it be your voice of skepticism towards anyone trying to sell you a hot new token – or an entire new buzzword whose meaning nobody can quite agree on.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TOKEN SALE,David Z.

42411603,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP07K,1640289269,5 Ways Money Was Reimagined in 2021,"It was the year of crypto!  For this, the first of two holiday editions of this Money Reimagined column, we frame this remarkable year in terms of how, in different ways, money was reimagined in 2021. We look at five themes, with links to past newsletters and podcasts.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  In 2021, money became…  A meme  Whether it was the mania for dogecoin, the surge of interest in non-fungible tokens or the capacity for Wall Street Bets to set the price of “meme stocks” like GameStop, we witnessed a strange merging of finance and popular culture. As incredulous as people were in both traditional financial and Bitcoin circles, we at Money Reimagined felt somewhat vindicated. The trend underscored a theme we’ve explored in both the newsletter and the podcast: that monetary systems require a shared belief in their common value. This era of reimagined money is bound to see the deployment of art, iconography, stories and other cultural products to bolster the sense of belonging and belief among communities that form around these new systems.  A politicized idea  For the past century, no one really questioned the nature and structure of our systems of money. Money was issued by governments and it was run by banks. End of story. With the emergence of Bitcoin, there was suddenly a new way to think about things. But for most of its existence, the political class felt it could simply ignore it.  In 2021, that blissful ignorance suddenly became impossible. We first saw this with the debate over the infrastructure bill, most importantly in the U.S. Senate, when the impositions of a contentious tax reporting provision for cryptocurrency sales had the ironic effect of demonstrating that crypto had arrived in Washington. The fact that legislators wanted to tax crypto was a sign that it was recognized as a long-term prospect, a reliable source of tax revenue. Just as importantly, the crypto lobby, though ultimately unsuccessful in its bid to force changes to those more draconian parts of the provision, showed its clout on Capitol Hill has grown significantly. It forged a large, bipartisan coalition of lawmakers to support its preferred amendments and showed it will be a force going forward.  Around the same time, the conversation around stablecoins as alternatives to central bank digital currencies started taking on greater appreciation in Washington. Randal Quarles, the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve until he resigned from the post in November, even argued that stablecoins could bolster U.S. power overseas by tapping into private sector innovation that central banks inherently won’t have access to. That set the stage for an intense debate on stablecoins through the summer and fall, particularly around whether issuers of stable tokens such as USDC and PAX should be required to get banking licenses.  Finally, in December, a crypto hearing in the House of Representatives revealed something that none of us would have predicted a year ago: some very well-informed questions from lawmakers. It seems that many in Congress have finally done their crypto homework. We had Nik De, CoinDesk’s managing editor for global policy and regulation, on the podcast to discuss it.  A matter of geopolitical importance  Even if it took federal politicians some time to wake up to the political ramifications of cryptocurrencies and of the central bank-led alternatives they helped spawn, China’s rapid development of the latter had caught the attention of academics and think tanks. They recognized that Beijing’s deployment of its Digital Currency Electronic Payments (DCEP) system, which went in for heavy testing in 2021, has the potential to disrupt U.S. dominance of the global financial system.  What few saw coming was that China would also forfeit a dominance of bitcoin mining that it had for many years by launching a crackdown against such operations around the country. That led to a massive drop in the Bitcoin network’s capacity, as about half of the global hashrate, or computing power, shut down. But that hash power soon moved elsewhere, and especially to the U.S. By October, the U.S. had become the biggest mining location in the world. Already people are talking about what this increased role for the U.S. in a decentralized currency means for the U.S. as China pushes its centralized monetary solution on the world.  A speculative force for social innovation  In 2020, the speculative fervor around decentralized finance fueled such a powerful flywheel of investment capital and innovation that it helped frame our look back on the 12 months that preceded the one-year anniversary of the “Money Reimagined” podcast this past October. In 2021, the phenomenon was taken to a new level as speculation around non-fungible tokens fueled a flurry of ideas around the future of media, art and collectibles, which in turn kept attracting more and more money into the space. It all felt very much like a bubble, but it was also clear that speculation in this case was a feature, not a bug, a powerful driver of change – even if we don’t yet know where that change is ultimately taking us.  A dinner party conversation  Perhaps the biggest theme of 2021 was simply how mainstream crypto had become in terms of public awareness. With the NFT zeitgeist, soaring token prices, the fact that Washington was more interested to learn about it and the ideas that swirled around bitcoin being a bet against a failing monetary system, crypto was suddenly everywhere. Everyone wanted to understand it. Meanwhile, plenty of people who did understand it, as well as many who didn’t, formed strong views on crypto’s pros and cons. So, be warned as you sit down for a holiday dinner with family, you may be asked to explain yourself.  Happy holidays!",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,Michael J.

The &apos;Bitcoin leverage ratio&apos; is an on-chain indicator that is defined as the open interest divided by the (derivative) exchange reserve. Here, the &apos;open interest&apos; is a measure of the amount of futures contracts currently open in the derivatives market. While the exchange reserve tells us how much BTC is stored in exchange wallets right now. The leverage ratio basically shows the amount of leverage used by users on average. The metric&apos;s value helps us know whether Bitcoin investors are taking a high risk or a low risk. When the value of this ratio moves up, it means investors are picking up more leverage as they are confident in their positions. On the other hand, a decreasing trend of the indicator would mean investors are reducing risk, and closing off their positions.

Lummis, who sits on the Senate Banking committee, wants nothing short of full normalization for digital assets in the U.S., the aide said. Her upcoming bill will propose doing just that with federal rules for stablecoins, consumer protection provisions and updated taxation guidance, as well as a new watchdog: a self-regulatory organization administered by the executive branch’s securities and swaps regulators.  Many of these issues are currently regulated at the state level.  Lummis previously told CoinDesk she was working on a ”comprehensive” bill slated for this calendar year. Bloomberg reported its updated timeline and scope Thursday.  Read more: Most Influential 2021: Cynthia Lummis  The effort comes as Congress grapples with digital assets on multiple fronts. House members grilled key crypto executives earlier this month in a hearing as much about education as it was about oversight of the fast-growing industry.  Lummis’ bill will target one of the executives’ major gripes: that securities laws are too murky to work with crypto and its many token types.

42420819,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYl5x,1640275279,Telegram CEO Endorses TON Blockchain Spin-Off Toncoin,"According to Telegram, its TON blockchain is not dead anymore but has returned to life as Toncoin, independently from the company that created it.  Telegram CEO Pavel Durov published a post in his official Telegram channel on Thursday that gave backing to the project.  “When Telegram said goodbye to TON last year, I expressed the hope that future generations of developers would one day carry on with our vision of a mass-market blockchain platform,” he wrote. “So I was inspired to see the champions of Telegram’s coding contests continue developing the open TON project, which they rebranded to Toncoin.” He included a link to the Toncoin community group. The statement prompted a nearly 30% spike in the toncoin token price, according to CoinMarketCap data.  It was a surprising move from the company, which has never before commented on the projects that use its blockchain code, abandoned after a run-in with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020. The endorsement seems to put an end to the informal rivalry between two teams who took over TON’s open-source code and launched separate proof-of-stake blockchains: Free TON (recently re-branded as Everscale) and Toncoin. Both of their tokens are listed on a number of crypto exchanges.  Durov emphasized the absence of a link between Toncoin and Telegram: “Unlike the original TON, Toncoin is independent from Telegram. But I wish its team the same success. Coupled with the right go-to-market strategy, they have all they need to build something epic.”  Still, some observers say the statement leaves open the question of Telegram’s involvement with Toncoin, potentially violating a ban from the SEC on launching any crypto tokens until 2023, which was imposed after the company settled its court case with the regulator.  “The key question here is, whether the U.S. justice system would be willing to dig into the connection [between Telegram and Toncoin] and whether Durov would have enough time and money for a new round of fighting,” said Fedor Skuratov, a former community manager at TON Labs, the venture-backed company that helped Telegram test the blockchain before it quit the project.  Durov might be trying to show the U.S. regulator that it couldn’t actually stop his technology, Skuratov said. He “supported Toncoin and formally distanced himself from it at the same time.”  Telegram did not respond CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.  Choosing the winner  The obligation to shut TON left Telegram scrambling for money to repay investors who had paid upfront in advance of receiving tokens. This February, the company sold bonds to raise $1 billion, its first-ever securities sale. According to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti, Telegram is also preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) in 2023, aiming for a $30 billion to $50 billion valuation.  Telegram started working on the TON blockchain in 2018, raising $1.7 billion in two private funding rounds from Silicon Valley household names, as well as Russian billionaires and institutional investors around the world. However, after an eight-month fight with the SEC over whether the project’s token was a security, Telegram quit the case, paid a penalty of $18.5 million and said it would no longer support the project.  Soon after, a group of developers and professional validators led by TON Labs launched a version of the blockchain named Free TON. In 2021, another group launched a second version, calling it Newton.  Newton’s leading developer, Anatoly Makosov, asked Telegram though a request on GitHub to hand over the ownership of the ton.org domain and the project’s repository, to which Telegram agreed. Soon after that, the project took the name TON and was listed on a range of small-cap crypto exchanges.  As to why Durov chose to support Toncoin rather than Everscale, Skuratov said he believes that’s because Toncoin’s team “does not position itself as independent and ‘follows Telegram’s legacy’ without any leadership ambitions of their own, and Durov likes that.”  Everscale made a point of cutting all ties with Telegram to avoid a “toxic” association with the project targeted by the U.S. regulator, Skuratov said.  TON Labs CEO Alexander Filatov said Everscale isn’t connected to Telegram’s project anymore, even at a technical level, and has switched to a different programming language.  ”[The] former Free TON community a few month ago consciously chose to move to the Rust implementation of the node/network (TON is on C++) and rebrand the ecosystem to Everscale,” Filatov told CoinDesk. “But we share the same original roots with Toncoin, so I want to wish them good luck.”  Makosov had not responded to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.",POSITIVE,TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | TON,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/23/telegram-ceo-endorses-ton-blockchain-spinoff-toncoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d05f4036333f8e9a44c3a278f4d28b231a080a44-1200x795.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

And to do their stories justice, we illustrate them with a range of striking original portraits.  Each December we pick the subjects of these profiles through a reader survey and editorial deliberations, hoping to represent the full breadth of the crypto industry.  See also: CoinDesk’s Most Influential 2021  This year’s list featured the likes of Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX, Gary Gensler of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Trung Nguyen of the Axie Infinity gaming phenom. It also had Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) who fought for crypto in the U.S. Congress, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who, like him or not, showed how tweeting can move markets.  The artists  CoinDesk asked 10 artists to create portraits of the top honorees. We wanted these artists to interpret these pioneers, many of whose images are well known.  The artists took varied approaches.  For his portrait of Bankman-Fried, Pindar Van Arman used a robot “cloud painting” machine to make thousands of minute strokes on a canvas.  For “The Melancholic Seer,” an animation of Elon Musk, Federico Solmi used a mixture of 3D rendering, painting and motion capture to create a whimsical look at the space pioneer and huge DOGE fan.  “I wanted to represent him as a great thinker but at the same time in a costume,” Solmi told CoinDesk TV, explaining his process. “He’s like Frederick Nietzsche, a very involved thinker. But then a spaceship leaves Earth, and he becomes like a child.”  Inspired by “Wonder Woman,” Gisel X Florez represented Cynthia Lummis as she’s probably never been represented before.  And Skygolpe did away with Gary Gensler’s face entirely, leaving it to viewers to decide whether the SEC chair is a friend of the crypto industry, or something else.  As well as showing their work as part of our package, these artists sold non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of their work on platforms such as SuperRare and Foundation. The artists have collectively raised about 50 ETH so far (about $200,000 at current prices), with roughly 20% of that going to charities of their choice.  CoinDesk thanks our NFT platform partners and The Giving Block, which facilitated the donations.  “We are thankful to partner with CoinDesk to offer the creator community a way to give back to charities and causes they care about while advancing crypto adoption and NFTs as a cultural medium,” said Duke Kim, The Giving Block’s director of crypto partnerships.

42411599,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzxP,1640267400,Are Spot Crypto ETFs Really Worth the Wait?,"Why are we waiting on cryptocurrency ETFs? Seriously.  I know there are now a few options to invest in bitcoin futures via an exchange-traded fund (ETF), and there are spot bitcoin ETFs available in Canada, but it seems like many financial advisors and writers are waiting with bated breath for a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. to suddenly open up the floodgates of digital asset investing to the entire world.  I think that a sizable cohort of ETF watchers is terribly misled – and even worse, is misleading others.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  Advisors and investors have what they need now  The truth is that advisors and investors already have what they need to get started in crypto today. I’ve recently written about a recent proliferation in services that allow advisors to work with their clients’ digital assets, including Onramp Invest, BlockChange and Flourish.  There’s also no shortage of education and information services about digital assets, from this newsletter to a plethora of other sources, including blockchain developers themselves, who usually pride themselves on transparency.  Yet, the proponents of digital assets ETFs keep telling us that they will open access to new investors who either do not have the ability to learn about cryptocurrencies or who are prevented from accessing them by regulations.  The continuing appeal of a spot ETF  “In the end, being able to have direct exposure is most important,” said A.J. Nary, the founder of HeightZero, a technology platform intended to allow advisors and wealth managers gain direct exposure to and manage digital assets for their end clients, providing reporting for portfolio management and tax reporting systems. “A spot ETF would be attractive to some investors who just want something that trades on a traditional exchange and understand how it works. It’s really no different than investors who buy shares of a publicly traded company that holds a lot of bitcoin on its balance sheet as a way to get exposure to the asset. I think the interest is primarily coming from family offices and institutional investors.”  Currently, HeightZero permits access to bitcoin and ether, only because Nary and his partners believe these two cryptocurrencies are commodities, not securities, and therefore not governed by custody rules, which for the time being allows advisors to co-custody digital assets with their clients. (The custody question is one that has yet to be definitively answered by regulators.)  Another service, Swan Advisor Services, was launched by Swan Bitcoin. As its name suggests, it is focused solely on bitcoin, for reasons similar to HeightZero.  “We launched a third-party coin ownership service because an ETF, mutual fund, hedge fund or limited partnership structure is just a paper claim to the currency,” said Swan Advisor Services founder Andy Edstrom. “We think it’s important that clients have the ability to withdraw their holdings to self-custody and cold storage when they’re ready, and we’re prepared to help educate them on how to do it. The expectation of ETF fans is that people are years or decades away from understanding self-custody or collaborative custody with an advisor or that for some it will never happen. But I think the industry is ready to educate them and help them do it themselves.”  Spot ETFs are enticing, however, because they plug so easily into existing financial infrastructure, whether it be advisors’ current portfolio management software or a client’s account aggregation dashboard on a portal or personal finance application.  The current state of digital assets products  They also represent a noticeable improvement from existing digital assets products in the U.S., said Dan Eyre, the CEO of BITRIA, formerly Blockchange, a turnkey asset management platform for digital assets. (A turnkey asset management program allows independent financial advisors, typically fiduciaries, to outsource the management of some or all of their clients’ assets.)  “The Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts and BitWise index products of the world are pretty inefficient, they have no mechanism to tie back into the net-asset value, so they have these wild swings where it might trade at a 30% premium one day and a few months later have a 21% discount to net asset value,” said Eyre. [Editor’s note: Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, the parent company of CoinDesk.] “You don’t have the same problem with a spot ETF. It’s a simple instrument that offers fairly efficient access to the speculative nature of bitcoin prices. It’s a starting point.”  Ben Cruikshank, the founder of fintech Flourish, feels similarly about the prospects of spot crypto ETFs, even though his platform is designed to enable collaborative custody.  “The needs of the crypto community are definitely different than the needs of the advisory community, because in the crypto community there’s a lot of mantras and thinking around self-custody,” said Cruikshank. “As an advisor, on average, one of my clients would forget their email password at least once a week, so how do I work with them on keeping their private keys safe? People work with advisors because they want their financial lives to be simpler, and self-custody feels a lot more complex than outsourcing custody to a qualified custodian. We think that today, the clients of advisors will want to outsource custody.  “We think that, increasingly, people will look to outsource the custody of their digital assets,” Cruikshank said. “Remember that 40 years ago it was common to keep stock certificates and bearer bonds in a safe deposit box, but now custodians like Fidelity and Schwab keep those assets secure on our behalf. Fundamentally, we believe clients will want this to be simple.”  And this simplicity and security, more than anything else, may be why so many advisors feel like true spot cryptocurrency ETFs are going to be worth the wait.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/23/are-spot-crypto-etfs-really-worth-the-wait,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/330a325e75244af8616a58836603b4818d0b7f9a-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42411605,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glP0HF,1640267400,What Blockchain Projects Can Do for Social Good,"Today’s investors have proven that sustainability and social impact factor highly in their decision making. In 2020, environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) funds surpassed the $1 trillion mark for the first time, accelerated in part by a growing social and political awareness throughout the coronavirus pandemic.  There’s a natural intersection between impact investing and blockchain – ask anyone with personal stake in the space. Investors, executives and developers alike are known for having visionary goals that could potentially lead to both profit and social good.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it every Thursday.  While things are still nascent, blockchain professionals argue the future use cases of blockchain technology could solve every kind of problem from government corruption to wealth inequality.  I’ve spoken to a few founders and thought leaders about how their decentralized projects could bring about positive social impact, from altruism to intellectual property and data security.  Interestingly, each of these areas could also potentially address wealth inequality – if executed correctly – by unlocking access to wealth for marginalized people through crypto and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Gamifying and promoting altruism  The founder and CEO of the nonprofit NFT platform Leyline, Jeremy Dela Rosa, plans on creating opportunities for gamers in developing economies to earn crypto and grow wealth through video games. He also plans on making altruism profitable through NFT prizes, rewards and virtual social currency.  “Play is just so fundamental to who we are as humans,” Dela Rosa tells CoinDesk. “But the way our economic system has been designed, it’s incentivizing the wrong things.”  Dela Rosa, who spent 10 years working at Blizzard Entertainment before founding Leyline, believes the way to motivate altruistic behavior in the “real” world outside of video games is to gamify it. His team plans on coding an open-source decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that rewards Proof-of-Good (PoG) points, which users can store in a virtual backpack. For gamers, these PoG points will be able to unlock special rewards and powers within their virtual worlds.  “It’s really about aligning incentives towards the things that are valuable for humanity,” Dela Rosa says.  Protecting intellectual property  NFTs are popular among artists for their potential to revolutionize intellectual property ownership.  “Gaming companies make millions of dollars off of dances,” says former “America’s Got Talent” contestant Snap Boogie, the CEO and founder of Beauty in the Streets, which partnered with the blockchain platform Enjin earlier this year to tokenize the dance move “Speedy Walkovers.”  It may seem abstract to turn a dance move into an NFT, but gaming companies are already capturing dance moves they see in street performances and on TV, recreating them without attribution using digital sensors in motion studios, then translating them to the screen to be bought and sold as in-game purchases for popular games like Fortnite.  Turning a dance move into an NFT helps prevent game companies and motion capture studios from using tokenized motions without first purchasing the token from the artist. Blockchain’s open-source transparency could potentially mean that all transactions live on a digital ledger that links dance moves to their creators.  These potential intellectual property protections could apply to nearly every creative industry – not just dance. SX Noir, a thought leader at the intersection of sex tech and the metaverse, believes NFTs present a long-awaited opportunity for adult performers to have full ownership over their labor and content.  “Sex workers have often been the scapegoats,” she explains, citing a 2020 move by major credit card issuers Visa, Mastercard, and Discover to block financial transactions on a popular adult video website when the site went under investigation.  “It was devastating,” she says. “There were a lot of performers who were left hungry.”  Meanwhile, so-called tube sites are known for aggregating adult video content without permission, exposing performers’ intellectual property to millions for free consumption.  While the guidelines for intellectual property and NFTs are still in their infancy, the digitally scarce form of a crypto token presents some possible solutions about which artists and creatives alike are excited.  Bolstering data security  Everyone who uses Instagram knows the power of user data. We’ve gotten used to seeing customized ads designed by algorithms to know our intimate preferences.  But blockchain enthusiasts say that’s Web 2 – an era in which the internet we know and love is owned by a handful of not-so-transparent corporations. (Google and Facebook, to name a few.)  Web 3 data will still have ads, but user data will be decentralized and run predominantly on blockchain – at least if data security company Snickerdoodle has its way. The indelible nature of blockchain could give everyday internet users a chance to give big companies a taste of their own medicine by charging them for access to their user history (for once).  “At Snickerdoodle, we think that self-sovereignty of data is of the utmost importance and will redefine a new social contract,” says CEO and co-founder Jonathan Padilla. “People conceive of Web 3 as a chance to restart both the internet and traditional financial systems.”  The long-term applications of Snickerdoodle’s vision parallels Andrew Yang’s concept of a “Freedom Dividend” or universal basic income (UBI). Except funding won’t necessarily have to be raised through taxes, according to Padilla.  “We think if we get our data models correct, we can have a private sector-based UBI,” he explains. “It can be done using blockchain-based tools to empower individuals, especially in emerging markets where that value can go a lot further, to have a passive source of income. And at the same time, that income can be applied for economic development, mobility. So that’s an incredibly powerful thing.”  Bottom line  For advisors, learning about up-and-coming blockchain projects is the decentralized equivalent to researching individual stocks. Buying into blockchain projects won’t make sense for every individual investor, but those with the appropriate risk appetite and robust enough portfolios may find themselves gravitating towards purchasing utility tokens for projects they care about as a way to diversify.  Such utility tokens are somewhat of a gamble because they involve speculating as to which projects are here to stay. They’re effectively a vote of confidence, backed by money, for the blockchain startups in which your clients are interested. But they could also pay off monetarily. Utility tokens are issued on the same blockchain upon which the larger product is built, and they can often be used later as a currency or as a way to obtain services.  As financial advisor and Onramp Invest CEO Tyrone Ross put it in a recent “On Purpose” podcast episode, the old financial playbook is out the window. Whereas before an investor or advisor could rely on traditional research methods like technical analysis, reading the news and pulling up a company’s public financial statements to research prospective investments, researching blockchain companies requires knowing an entirely new landscape.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ENJ | MARKET | RESEARCH,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/23/what-blockchain-projects-can-do-for-social-good,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/76f88487d4eab1b8a22cf7424a961aa42a79035e-8681x7639.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The round is led by Alameda Research with participation from Spartan Group, Brevan Howard, and A41.

SWIFT is planning a series of experiments in the first quarter around improving the exchange of information between the participants and systems that interact during the lifecycle of tokenized assets, according to a Tuesday announcement.  The experiments will use central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) as well as established forms of payment.  The organization, which links more than 11,000 institutions, aims to support the issuance, delivery-versus-payment and redemption processes, demonstrating how it could support “a frictionless and seamless tokenized digital asset market.”  Following the example of the crypto world, banks and securities firms are offering services whereby fractions of assets are sold as digital tokens to allow for greater liquidity and accessibility.  SWIFT is a global messaging network connecting banks and other financial institutions for cross-border payments.

42396285,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2SGF,1640259660,"Crypto Markets See Mixed Session as Terra Falls, NEAR Sets All-Time High","Crypto markets had a mixed session early Thursday, with bitcoin and ether little changed while some alternative coins posted gains of more than 10%.  Leading the advance among top altcoins with a market capitalization of over $1 billion was NEAR, the token of the Near high-speed blockchain Ethereum rival, which surged 33% in 24 hours to an all-time high of $13.52.  This move came after decentralized payments network Terra said it would issue its UST stablecoins – pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar – on the Near network, as CoinDesk reported on Wednesday.  ”NEAR has developed an [impressive] scaling solution that surpasses most available alternatives,” Jack Tao, CEO of crypto exchange Phemex told CoinDesk on Telegram. “It comes as no surprise that more and more projects will integrate or begin to develop on this ecosystem. With the launch of its Aurora EVM solution, I expect to see even more growth in the years to come.”  Data from CoinGecko showed $1.3 billion worth of NEAR traded on Wednesday. The price jump caused $6 million in liquidations on NEAR futures, a relatively small value that implies the rally was mainly led by spot traders.  Memecoin shiba inu (SHIB) was a top performer among other large-cap altcoins. The price of SHIB increased 7% on Thursday morning as whales – or large holders – further increased their exposure.  Terra gives back gains while DeFi tokens rally  LUNA, the native token of Terra, fell 11% as of Thursday morning to $85 after setting an all-time high of $97 on Wednesday. The volatility caused over $10 million worth of liquidations on LUNA futures in the past 24 hours, data from Coinglass showed.  LUNA’s drop came after a nearly month-long rally from $42 driven by the broader market’s interest in Ethereum rivals including Terra, Solana and Avalanche and increasing decentralized finance (DeFi) activity on the Terra network.  Other DeFi-centric tokens were less volatile. DeFi refers to a financial system based on smart contracts on blockchain networks instead of centralized middlemen for services like lending, trading and borrowing.  Ethereum is the current DeFi market leader, with over $155 billion locked in protocols on its network, DeFi Llama data shows. Terra overtook Binance Smart Chain earlier this week to become the second-largest platform, locking over $18.97 billion in value on its network.  In the past 24 hours, prices of Polkadot’s DOT token rose 4% to $27, while Avalanche’s AVAX and Solana’s SOL both lost 2.5%, according to CoinGecko. Tokens of Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Uniswap (UNI) surged nearly 9% after developers said they would launch the platform on Polygon, a scaling solution for Ethereum that has its own blockchain.  Another top gainer was lending protocol Aave, with its token recording a 15% surge in the past 24 hours. Prices soared as Switzerland’s SEBA Bank proposed joining Aave Arc, a permissioned DeFi product aimed at institutions. The regulated bank said in a post that its clients were interested in accessing DeFi services via Aave and becoming active participants in the broader DeFi ecosystem.  Bitcoin lost 0.6% after failing to break a resistance level of $49,000 on Thursday, while ether has dropped 1.6% in the past 24 hours. The moves came as trading volumes remained low across major centralized exchanges in advance of the year-end holiday season.  Similar trading conditions were observed on global markets in European hours on Thursday. The Stoxx Europe 600, a European equities index tracking 600 companies, and futures for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were little changed, Bloomberg reported.",NEUTRAL,SHIB | NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | NEAR,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/23/crypto-markets-see-mixed-session-as-terra-falls-near-sets-all-time-high,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/99e854d411ac82323b7950682e59fced49cab32c-1440x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42396269,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2S1U,1640253152,BNB Burns Will Now Better Reflect DeFi Activity on Binance Smart Chain,"Crypto exchange Binance has made changes to how it removes Binance coins (BNB) from circulation, a process known as burning, to better reflect their usage in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem, the exchange said in a blog post Thursday.  The Binance Smart Chain, introduced in April 2020, is a network for decentralized finance (DeFi), a financial system based on smart contracts rather than middlemen for services like lending, trading and borrowing. Binance coins are used to pay transaction fees on BSC and allow holders to make changes and additions to protocols running atop the chain.  The new system, dubbed Auto-Burn, will occur continuously and replaces a quarterly burning schedule that reflected the tokens’ usage on various trading products offered by Binance’s centralized exchange. A real-time burning system that removed a portion of the gas fees spent on BSC remains in place.  The move aims to provide more transparency for the broader BNB community and is independent of revenues generated on the Binance exchange, the world’s largest by volume, through the use of BNB, the company said.  “Our announcement of the BNB Auto-Burn is a natural next step in BNB’s journey and will help the BNB community grow through providing greater autonomy, transparency, and predictability,” a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk.  Under Auto-Burn, burns will be based on price and supply-demand dynamics for BNB using on-chain information from BSC. So as the BNB price falls, the amount of BNB burned increases to ensure the value removed remains constant and is independent of market movements.  Burning BNB, which involves sending tokens to an inaccessible wallet, effectively removes them from circulation forever. It was initially introduced as a mechanism to accrue value and grow Binance. But as the broader crypto market grew and Binance Smart Chain was launched, BNB found uses beyond simply being an exchange token. It is the third-largest coin by market value, according to CoinMarketCap data, behind only bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). It was trading at about $530 in European hours on Thursday morning.  As of Thursday, DeFi on BSC is a $17 billion market, DeFi Llama data shows, with over 231 protocols operational on the network.  BNB Auto-Burn will be halted when the total circulation of BNB drops below 100 million. BNB currently has a 168 million circulating supply.

42396278,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2S9M,1640252368,"India’s Crypto Law Might Not Be Ready Before May, Sources Say","In what may come as a major disappointment for India’s crypto community, a law to regulate cryptocurrencies is unlikely until at least after next April, several people familiar with the matter told CoinDesk.  The legislation is still a work in progress. While the bill titled “The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021″ was listed on the website of the Lok Sabha (the lower house of India’s Parliament), for the winter session of Parliament which ended Dec. 22, it was dropped in the final days of the session.  While it has been reported the government “wants to hold wider consultations on the matter,” CoinDesk has learned that the government is unlikely to complete those consultations before the next session of Parliament, commonly referred to as the Budget Session.  With only about a month left for the Budget Session it is highly unlikely the bill will be drafted before at least March because the Finance Ministry and institutional stakeholders responsible for shaping the bill have other competing priorities, said three individuals who work closely with the Finance Ministry but were not authorized to speak to the press.  The development is both a blow to India’s burgeoning crypto ecosystem and an opportunity. The crypto industry has been eager for favorable regulation, but the delay keeps the uncertainty alive, complicates processes that exchanges are trying to put in place and slows down the process that could move people in the world’s second most populated country toward adopting cryptocurrencies. The flipside though is that the delay gives more time to the industry to engage and comply with the government.  The much-anticipated law has been hotly debated and desired by industry stakeholders to chart out a roadmap toward financial stability. Uncertainty hit a low point in April 2018 when India’s central bank, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banned banks from supporting or engaging in crypto transactions until the Supreme Court overturned the ban two years later. Since then, discussions between government, industry and policy experts about how to regulate crypto have been ongoing.  The finance minister informed Parliament that “because rapidly a lot of things had to come into play, we had started working on a new bill.” Reports indicate the proposed bill has replaced the word “cryptocurrency” with “crypto-asset.”  The bill has also reportedly evolved from prohibiting “all private cryptocurrencies in India” while allowing “for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses,” to enabling cryptocurrency to be used as an asset but banning its use as currency or payment. Violations would reportedly result in a non-bailable warrant and/or fines, implemented by watchdogs – the RBI and the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).  The stakes for a favorable outcome for India’s crypto industry are incredibly high. According to one report, India has the most crypto users in the world, almost four times the number the U.S. has.  Several factors contribute to the continued state of uncertainty around the law.  Budget session  The next session of Parliament, which is likely to begin at the end of January, is known as the Budget Session. The finance minister presents the budget. This is the primary priority.  The Finance Ministry, tasked with drafting the cryptocurrency bill, also has the fiscal responsibility of making the budget. The budget, likely to be presented Feb. 1, is expected to dominate the resources of the ministry, leaving little or no time for other priorities.  “During the Budget Session, the finance ministry gives every single senior official a sectoral responsibility, and as a result nobody is performing their normal functions,” said Vivan Sharan, a technology and policy expert who has worked with the government in the past.  The Budget Session will likely last until at least the end of April.  Subhash Garg, a former secretary in the Finance Ministry’s Department of Economic Affairs, told CoinDesk he did not see how the ministry could both draft a budget while also working on the cryptocurrency bill.  “One cannot speculate about whether the bill will come in the monsoon session in July. There are much deeper issues. I don’t know if the government is expanding the scope of the bill. I could take even longer and perhaps, should take longer,” Garg said.  Past trends around major bills and reports indicate that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will make a final decision on the regulatory framework amid conflicting views among stakeholders.  In November 2021, Modi, who has reportedly held several rounds of discussions on the matter, indicated a vision for crypto regulation when he said, “We must also jointly shape global norms for emerging technologies, like social media and cryptocurrencies, so that they are used to empower democracy, not to undermine it.”  However, over the next month, the Prime Minister’s Office is likely to be busy drafting the speech of the president of India, which kicks off the first session of a new year, the Budget Session.  Competing priorities  Political stakeholders will also face the competing priority of upcoming elections in five states, including arguably the most important state election in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state.  These elections, currently slated for February or March, could have the effect of delaying discussions to create political consensus. It could curtail the Budget Session of Parliament, as was the case in 2021. At that time, “due to demand of leaders of various political parties in both the Houses” the session was shortened “so that Members could participate in the election process in certain states/UTs.”  It is likely that the upcoming elections would both distract from and result in less time for the cryptocurrency bill to be scrutinized.  Some parts of the government are also focused on Jan. 26, 2022, India’s Republic Day, when the country marks and celebrates the date on which its Constitution came into effect.  International input  The Indian government also appears to want more international input on cryptocurrency regulations and frameworks. It has already decided to study regulatory measures other nations are considering and how global standards on cryptocurrencies evolve. The Finance Ministry has also reached out to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) to frame its legislation, as it seeks wider consultations on the matter.  Signals from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also suggest a similar approach. On Dec. 9, the IMF outlined the need to start “now” to tackle what will prove to be a “daunting task,” calling for “comprehensive, consistent and coordinated” global regulations that provide “a level playing field to harness the benefits of crypto’s underlying technology while mitigating its risks.”  The IMF’s Chief Economist Gita Gopinath called for crypto regulation rather than a ban while in India earlier this month.  She met top government officials, including Modi. She also met officials of NITI Aayog, a public policy think tank of the Indian government where cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks were discussed, according to an individual with direct knowledge of the meeting.  RBI, a critical institutional stakeholder to the consultations and one that has stated its desire for a complete ban on all private cryptocurrencies, is also occupied with closely monitoring inflationary pressures and the impact of COVID-19 on the economy.  RBI also has to be vigilant in its regulatory and supervisory role with respect to regulated entities, such as banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), as the full impact of COVID-19 on these lending institutions has yet to unfold. The big looming uncertainty over all this is the threat of the omicron variant.  While the RBI is adequately staffed with specific departments to discharge these tasks, it still does not have a fintech department, just a division, leaving questions about efficiency and long-term commitment unanswered.  Catch-22 situation  India is caught between an urgent need for regulating cryptocurrencies and accurately framing the bill through widespread discussions, which takes time.  This catch-22 situation can be seen in last week’s RBI board meeting. Board members sought a presentation on RBI’s position on cryptocurrencies because “the sense of urgency is multiplying for various quarters and therefore the timing of the presentation is also not without purpose,” said at least one individual with knowledge of the matter. The other suggested the presentation was “part of the comfortable ongoing overall dialogue between government and RBI on cryptocurrencies.”  The RBI told its board it would like to ban all cryptocurrencies, a position that has not changed since its 2018 notification that imposed a similar ban until the Supreme Court of India overturned it last year.  Though the overwhelming sentiment of the board meeting was that cryptocurrencies “cannot be ignored” and a “lot of consideration among all actors is required” before regulations can be implemented, said two people familiar with the matter.  “The Indian government is still grappling with several open questions, including capital control and taxation, that stem from the complexities of the crypto business models and the technology underpinning them,” Sharan said.  National consensus and security  Widespread consultations are the government’s mantra going forward, and the government is inclined to make a law only when there is a kind of a national consensus driven by stakeholder consensus. Five experts who spoke with CoinDesk separately agreed with the three sources who said the crypto law could take till at least May.  “I don’t see the government introducing the bill in parliament without first inviting comments from the public,” said Rashmi Deshpande, a legal expert who has worked with cryptocurrency stakeholders and has made representations on their behalf to the government.  “Remember the Supreme Court ruling had pulled up the RBI for not consulting stakeholders before its circular restricting the banks from providing services to crypto currency exchanges,” Deshpande said.  This would follow a larger balance between the ambit of the cryptocurrencies and the global trends and design around cryptocurrencies. It would also be in line with the geopolitical shift in a new world order involving an expansionist China.  India has a number of international security threats related not just to Pakistan but also escalating tensions with China. So, the concern is whether the cryptocurrency route can be used to create more international security issues.  India is also concerned about the possibility of a Chinese digital yuan posing an economic threat to India’s own CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). The concern with China is that India missed out on the artificial intelligence bus and that it might miss out on a digital revolution that cryptocurrency might offer.  India’s regulatory framework has a vision to counter the rising contentions related to cryptocurrencies and their potential weaponization.  Legislative precedence  The government’s pattern has also been to avoid rushing technical bills. The cryptocurrency bill was listed to be introduced in the last two sessions of Parliament but was not introduced.  If the crypto bill is introduced in the Budget Session, it is likely to be sent to a committee, referred to as the select committee, specifically formed for the purpose of deliberating and scrutinizing the bill. This committee is also unlikely to complete its deliberations in the same session of Parliament.  Legislative precedent also suggests a lengthy process for a crypto law. Hotly debated legislation that is technical in nature usually sees additional scrutiny.  With a technical piece of legislation, Parliament would want to hear from multiple stakeholders both within and outside the industry. Therefore, the usual parliamentary scrutiny would take longer than with other legislation, as has happened with other technical bills such as the Personal Data Protection Bill of 2019 and the DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill of 2019. Both bills were sent to a select committee for additional scrutiny.  All major legislative decisions also have to come from the Prime Minister’s Office, such as a recent move to revoke India’s contentious farm laws. It is likely that a final decision on the regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency bill would follow a similar path. The question is whether it would come through a final decision on what the contours of the bill should be for a legislative introduction in Parliament or as a special order (known as an ordinance) when Parliament is not in session.  Between the Winter Session (which ended Dec. 22) and the Budget Session (which is likely to start at the end of January), the government could technically bring in cryptocurrency legislation through an ordinance or special order, but sources said this is highly unlikely.  “Chances are very low that the government uses the ordinance tool,” said Anirudh Rastogi, who regularly advises several stakeholders on cryptocurrency related policy issues.  Other possibilities include the government re-prioritizing the bill if a crypto scam emerges or the government considering regulation in parts.  “Modular regulations aimed at decoupling the laws like amending the RBI act to bring in the central bank’s digital currency are possible,” Sharan said.

42411585,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glOzJj,1640228755,How Crypto Losses Could Result in Tax Benefits,"Even if you suffered losses on your crypto investments this year, there’s still some good news.  Michelle O’Connor is VP of Marketing at TaxBit.  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service allows investors to claim deductions on cryptocurrency losses that can lessen tax liabilities or even result in a tax refund. There are also investment strategies you can use throughout the year to maximize your losses and get the most out of your crypto investments.  Offset capital gains  Cryptocurrency losses can be used to offset capital gains. A capital gain occurs when you sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of your crypto for a profit.  The tax you pay on capital gains depends on how long you’ve held your crypto.  Long-term capital losses for those assets held more than one year can be used to offset long-term capital gains; short-term capital losses for those assets held one year or less can be used to offset short-term capital gains. Remember that you’re only allowed to offset losses of the same type.  If you have both long- and short-term capital gains on an asset, it’s more beneficial to first harvest the short-term capital losses to offset your short-term gains, which have a higher tax rate.  No gains? Claim a deduction  If you don’t have any capital gains to offset, you can deduct up to $3,000 in capital losses per year from your ordinary income according to 26 U.S. Code § 1211 of the Internal Revenue Code.  If you have more than $3,000 in net capital losses in a taxable year, the excess losses can be carried forward into future tax years. You can use the losses to offset capital gains in a future tax year or claim a deduction again.  Tax-loss harvesting  You can also offset your capital gains throughout the year with an investment strategy known as tax-loss harvesting. This strategy helps you avoid unrealized losses – a loss you hold instead of selling and using for a tax refund.  Tax-loss harvesting takes advantage of dips in cryptocurrency market prices. It entails the sale of crypto or other digital assets when fair market value drops below cost basis – the asset’s value at the time you acquired it – to generate capital losses. You can continue to net those losses against capital gains and reduce your tax bill as described above.  Instead of only offsetting your capital gains at the end of the year, you could do so on a regular basis throughout the year, take advantage of those dips in price and have those crypto investments work more efficiently for your portfolio.  Exception to the ‘wash sale’ rule  As of December 2021, the “wash sale” rule only applies to stock and securities, not to cryptocurrency.  A wash sale occurs when a taxpayer harvests losses on a stock or security but purchases either the same one or a substantially identical one within a 30-day period before or after the sale. The IRS doesn’t allow a deduction for these losses on stocks and securities.  But the wash sale rule doesn’t apply to crypto. As a result, tax-loss harvesting is much more effective for crypto investments.  In conclusion  Don’t get distraught about your crypto losses. Losses happen to every investor. Instead, strategize about how you can put those losses to work, and continue to apply your newfound knowledge to future crypto investment plans.

42396268,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT2RzW,1640217601,Jack Dorsey Goes on Unfollowing Frenzy After Web 3 Beef,"To the uninitiated, it sounds like a bunch of rich guys arguing over how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  But beyond Twitter drama, Block Inc. CEO Jack Dorsey’s public sparring with venture capitalists over “Web 3″ serves as a proxy for a long-running debate – not only about which cryptocurrencies are best but what they are good for.  The contretemps highlights important questions about what a truly decentralized internet would really look like, and what role different stakeholders have in building it. Dorsey, a longtime bitcoin aficionado, appears to have aligned himself with the so-called maximalists, a camp highly suspicious of any rival to the original cryptocurrency and any non-monetary application of the underlying technology.  Both sides of the Web 3 debate bemoan the current state of the internet, dominated by a handful of large platforms (not least of all Twitter, where Dorsey stepped down as CEO last month). But the maximalists distrust the Web 3 crowd’s use of crypto tokens as a way to fund such projects. The fact that VCs are big holders of these tokens is, to the maximalists, damning, a classic case of “meet the old boss, same as the new boss.”  Web 3 advocates, which include but are not limited to VCs, counter that a variety of approaches is needed to make good on the internet’s liberating promise; that tokens can align participants’ interests in a network; that Web 3 developers’ reliance on VCs is a perverse consequence of outdated securities laws; and that while Bitcoin was a bona fide breakthrough, its utility is limited and the purists are being shortsighted.  Since his controversial tweet on Dec. 20, declaring that VCs, not users, control Web 3, thus making it a “centralized entity with a different label,” Dorsey has gone on an unfollowing spree on the social network he co-founded and ran for years.  Some of the most well-known players in the crypto space, including Andressen Horowitz (a16z) co-founder Marc Andreessen, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, have been felled by Dorsey’s unfollow button. Andreessen later blocked Dorsey.  Proponents, like Dorsey, have long touted the Bitcoin network’s utility as a tool of liberation to be used by the people, as a way to resist financial censorship and protect against hyperinflation. On that score, few if any in the Web 3 camp would likely disagree.  The ongoing debate centers around the level of decentralization in the burgeoning Web 3 space, into which big investors have been pouring money – and, in the eyes of their critics, gaining outsized control in exchange.  Dorsey has been increasingly critical of non-bitcoin crypto projects, which he sees as going against the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin, culminating in Monday night’s Twitter spat.  Web 3 investors and supporters alike pushed back against Dorsey’s claim that Web 3 will “never escape [venture capitalists’] incentives.”  Balaji Srinivasan, former chief technology officer of Coinbase and a former partner at a16z, responded to Dorsey’s tweet to voice his disagreement and point out how Twitter’s own corporate interests shaped the company in ways that betrayed its early slogan, “the free speech wing of the free speech party.”  “Web 3 offers the possibility, not guarantee, of something better,” Srinivasan tweeted.  “All false,” Dorsey replied, kicking off a fight that has lasted well into Wednesday and shows no sign of slowing down.  On Dec. 21, Dorsey re-tweeted an unflattering cartoon depicting an Ethereum-enabled Web 3 faucet pouring water into the waiting mouth of a corpulent venture capitalist, while a starving retail investor waited for droplets to fall on his tongue. In a quote-tweet of this post, Srinivasan pointed out that the Ethereum project was initially funded in 2014 by a public crowdsale, not through a venture capital round.  Later that evening, Dorsey tweeted more directly: “The VCs are the problem.”  Dorsey’s pot-stirring is reminiscent of another Big Tech CEO with a finger in the crypto pie – Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who also joined the fray on Monday night, tweeting “Has anyone seen web3? I can’t find it.”  Dorsey’s reply was a thinly veiled reference to Andreessen Horowitz’s domination of Web 3: “It’s somewhere between a and z.”  A16z bought $80 million in Twitter shares in 2011 on the secondary market.  Dorsey, for his part, seems to be taking the heat in stride.  When Andreessen blocked Dorsey on Twitter, Dorsey posted a screenshot and cheekily tweeted “I’m officially banned from web3.”  After unfollowing a host of prominent Web 3 supporters, Dorsey has gone on a following spree, adding several bitcoin maximalists and open-source software contributors.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/12/23/jack-dorsey-goes-on-unfollowing-frenzy-after-web-3-beef,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
