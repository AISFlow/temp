34244045,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645858,1727911812,Still Holding Your Hamster Kombat Tokens? You Might Be In For A Nice Surprise Soon,"Hamster Kombat burst into the trading scene in September after a long-running airdrop farming event. Despite all of the hype leading up to the launch of the token, the airdrop did come out to be disappointing for investors, even though it listed at around a $500 million. Since then, the price has struggled against the bearish headwinds, losing around 43% of its value. However, this decline may be coming to an end according to one analyst, who sees a bullish future for the HMSTR token. Hamster Kombat Develops Bullish Indicators Given the current state of the Hamster Kombat token and the consistent decline, it seemed at first that this was a failed launch. However, crypto analyst Saeed Sheikh sees an opportunity where many sees losses. In an analysis posted on the TradingView website, Sheikh explained that the current indicators could actually be bullish for the Hamster Kombat price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Market Not Over: CryptoQuant CEO Reveals Where We Are This Cycle As the crypto analyst explains in the post, the decline in the Hamster Kombat price has pushed the altcoin into oversold territory. This explains the sharp decline in price over the last month. But it is also bullish for the price, especially a popular altcoin like Hamster Kombat. When an asset is in oversold territory, it often means that it is due for a recovery. This is because the sellers will have exhausted their stash and this leaves only the holders in charge. As a result, support is often established for the price, providing a bounce point for the next recovery. If this is the case and the Hamster Kombat sellers are nearing exhaustion as it enters oversold territory, then Hamster Kombat could be forming support somewhere around $0.005. In this case, this would be the bounce-off point for the next rally and recover its losses from September. Where Is The Price Headed? Going by the crypto analyst’s chart, the Hamster Kombat price could more than double from here if it plays out correctly. There are multiple major targets to hit and overcome as they carry the most resistance for the altcoin from here. Related Reading: Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges The first target to hit is $0.009116 at the 0.382 Fibonacci level. Here is the first resistance, but arguably the most easiest to conquer from here. Next is the $0.011 target at the 0.236 Fibonacci level. Last but not least is the $0.014149 target, which is the strongest resistance. Naturally, as the price increases, so does the resistance from bears. Given the current position of the Hamster Kombat price at the time of this writing, hitting the very last target at $0.014149 would mean a more than 100% increase. However, this move is also largely dependent on how the Bitcoin price sways the crypto market, according to the crypto analyst.

He has recently done an analysis that shows the token is approaching a critical juncture. In the short term, prices may increase more than $1.50 if it can surpass the Genuine Wake-Up Line (GWUL). Related Reading: Could XRP See A 360% Surge By Christmas? Experts Think So Traders pay attention to the significant resistance levels of XRP since it displays the price pattern of the cryptocurrency. By the first of November in 2024, CoinCodex anticipates a 19.57% gain. This indicates that a significant number of market players believe the asset will increase in value. Resistance At The Genuine Wake-Up Line EGRAG recently released the GWUL following XRP’s successful passage of the Final Wake-Up Line, another key barrier. Since its formation following XRP’s high of $1.96 in April 2021, this new line has proved to be a formidable resistance. The analyst theorizes that XRP is now at the edge of breaking this level of resistance, meaning there could be a strong shift in market mood. Perhaps the token would start rallying towards $1.50 if it could close above the GWUL and manage to stay above after having breached above it. Mid-term projections are even more optimistic, with potential targets set between $5.50 and $7.50. #XRP Genuine Wake-Up Line (Micro Moves – Lower Time Frame) 🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨 🔍 A closer look at the borders of the GWUL (Genuine Wake-Up Line) reveals an intense battle ⚔️ between the #Bulls 🐂 and #Bears 🐻. The action is heating up, but guess what? The wave count is on our side!… https://t.co/RJoVyM8RiL pic.twitter.com/QcYFFQn0vl — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) October 1, 2024 EGRAG emphasizes that it is insufficient to simply barrel past the GWUL; XRP must maintain its position above this line for a minimum of three days. This confirmation is essential for the establishment of a favorable trend. At the moment, XRP is trading at approximately $0.58, which is why the next few days are so critical for its price movement. Patterns Suggest A Conflict Between Bears And Bulls On EGRAG’s chart, the GWUL and a yellow triangle indicate the trading conditions’ upper limit, with the Atlas Line supporting it. Within the larger yellow triangle, a smaller white triangle has also emerged, illustrating the ongoing market tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The stakes are high as XRP approaches the convergence point of these triangles. If investors are able to elevate XRP above this triangle, it could trigger a substantial bullish wave, thereby verifying the breach of the GWUL. Reaching the $1.50 threshold is particularly significant, as it would conclude Wave 1 of a more extensive Elliott Wave pattern, according to EGRAG. In the event that XRP surpasses this threshold, a corrective Wave 2 could occur, resulting in a decline to approximately $0.75 before a more substantive rally. This rally may ultimately result in the ambitious target of $7.50. Related Reading: Humor Or Sarcasm?

The federal regulator filed a ""notice of appeal"" to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, just under two months after Judge Analisa Torres imposed her final judgement in the regulator's now four-year-old-case against the crypto company.  In July 2023, the judge ruled that while Ripple violated federal securities law through its institutional sales of XRP, its programmatic sales to retail exchanges did not violate securities rules. The SEC attempted to file an interlocutory appeal against the motion for summary judgement, but was denied by the judge.  This past August, Judge Torres imposed a $125 million fine against Ripple, well below the nearly $2 billion the SEC requested in disgorgement, prejudgment interest and civil penalties. The judge stayed enforcement of this fine until after the SEC's deadline to file an appeal had elapsed or an appeal had been resolved by the circuit court.  In a statement, an SEC spokesperson said, ""We believe that the district court decision in the Ripple matter conflicts with decades of Supreme Court precedent and securities laws and look forward to making our case to the Second Circuit.""  After this article's publication, a Ripple spokesperson referred CoinDesk to tweets by CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty.  ""[The SEC] lost on everything that matters,"" Garlinghouse tweeted. ""Ripple, the crypto industry and the rule of law have already prevailed ... XRP's status as a non-security is the law of the land today.""  Alderoty called the appeal ""disappointing, but not surprising.""  In an interview in August, Alderoty told CoinDesk he expected the regulator to have a tough time convincing an appeals court to overturn a district court judge's ruling.  ""Even if they do appeal, I would just tell everyone 'take a deep breath,'"" he said at the time.  While the SEC filed its notice of appeal, it hasn't filed the appeal itself yet (in other legal proceedings like Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal case, the actual appeal has been filed months after the notice of appeal).  Earlier Wednesday, Bitwise filed an application to list and trade shares of an exchange-traded fund that would invest in XRP.  UPDATE (Oct. 2, 2024, 21:35 UTC): Adds additional detail.

34239208,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645915,1727901041,Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand,"SUI has experienced an impressive surge of over 160% since the start of September, with its price now hovering around $2. This remarkable rally has analysts and investors highly optimistic about the future of the layer-1 blockchain. Beyond its soaring price, SUI is showing strong growth across key metrics, signaling increasing adoption and usage. According to data from DefiLlama, SUI’s total value locked (TVL) has reached new all-time highs, indicating a robust demand for its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The rising TVL highlights a growing interest from users and developers, further boosting confidence in SUI’s long-term potential. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) ‘Could Go Parabolic’ Once It Breaks $200 Resistance – Analyst The price surge is not just driven by market sentiment but is backed by tangible growth in the platform’s fundamentals. With both TVL and user engagement increasing, the positive outlook for SUI continues to build. Investors are now eyeing higher price targets as they anticipate further growth for the layer-1 blockchain in the coming weeks. As SUI pushes to higher levels, its performance reflects both strong market support and underlying network growth, making it one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space. SUI TVL Signals Ongoing Rally SUI is currently testing a crucial supply level around the $2 mark, a psychological barrier that, once surpassed, could pave the way for a surge to new highs. Analysts are watching this level closely, as breaking through it would likely trigger a strong bullish move. On-chain data from DefiLlama supports this optimism, revealing that SUI’s total value locked (TVL) has reached an all-time high of $1.07 billion. This marks a remarkable 65% increase in TVL over the past 30 days, signaling growing confidence in the platform’s utility and long-term potential. The rise in TVL is a net positive for the SUI coin, as it reflects the increasing adoption of the Sui ecosystem. As more value flows into the network, the demand for SUI tokens will likely grow, creating upward pressure on its price. Investors often view rising TVL as a bullish signal, suggesting that the platform is gaining traction and trust among users. Related Reading: XRP Price Bullish Potential Grows – A Surge Above $0.65 Will Trigger Buyers If these positive trends in TVL and overall network activity continue, a rise above SUI’s previous all-time high of $2.16 seems likely in the coming weeks. With momentum building, many expect SUI to achieve further gains, reinforcing its position as a leading layer-1 blockchain. Price Action: Liquidity Levels To Watch SUI is currently trading at $1.89, just 15% away from its all-time high of $2.18. The recent price action has been promising, with an 8% surge in the past hours. Many analysts believe that if SUI can break above the critical $2 level, the chances of reaching new all-time highs are very high. This psychological barrier could trigger a wave of buying pressure, pushing the price to new levels. However, some investors are cautious, expecting a healthy correction before further upward movement. If SUI fails to break past the $2 mark, a retracement to support levels around $1.60, or even down to $1.45, would not be unexpected. Such a correction could provide a solid foundation for the next bullish leg, allowing SUI to gather momentum before attempting to breach the $2 resistance again.

Despite this, the overall sentiment remains optimistic, with many investors holding out for a new all-time high shortly.

Monday, Sept. 30  Bitget Wallet Launches 'OmniConnect,' Software Development Kit to Connect Telegram Mini-Apps to Solana, TON, EVM-Compatible Chains  Bitget Wallet, a Web3 non-custodial wallets, announced the launch of OmniConnect, a software development kit for developers to connect Telegram Mini-Apps to multichain ecosystems across major blockchains including Solana, TON and all EVM-compatible chains. According to the team: ""OmniConnect offers over a billion Telegram users and developers a seamless way to interact with multiple blockchains. Previously, Telegram Mini-Apps could only interact with the TON network."" The team answered a few of our questions:  Are developers able to get these apps on Telegram without getting Telegram's permission, or is it permissionless? Developers who want to create apps (like Mini Apps or Bots) for Telegram do not need explicit permission from Telegram, making it a permissionless process in many cases. They can leverage Telegram's APIs, SDKs and platform documentation to build and launch applications independently. However, to integrate or launch on a larger scale (like being featured in Telegram's Web Apps directory), developers might need to follow certain guidelines or approval processes.  Is the idea that this would give Telegram more options besides TON? Yes, developers can now create dapps that support multiple blockchains using our OmniConnect SDK, rather than relying solely on TON. This broadens the range of services and utilities available within Telegram.  Are there any design partners or mini-apps that have already gone live using this SDK? We just launched it yesterday, and there isn’t a partner product officially using the SDK yet, but we’re confident that will change soon.  On Tezos, Third-Party Proposal Trumps 'Quebec' Plan Floated by Core Nomadic Labs Team  A proposal by Tez Capital won approval from the Tezos blockchain community after being floated as an alternative to the core Nomadic Labs team's ""Quebec"" upgrade plan.

The alternative ""Qena"" proposal from Tez Capital kept the technical aspects of the Quebec proposals, but without the changes to Adaptive Issuance. It called for ""emphasizing stability and technical progress without disruptive economic changes. By maintaining the current Adaptive Issuance mechanism and avoiding frequent economic adjustments, Qena ensures a more predictable and stable environment for the Tezos ecosystem."" One respondent to the Reddit post wrote, ""Ngl, it’s pretty amazing to see a community member's proposal get pushed through."" {{XTZ}}  Decentralized Data-Storage Protocol Codex Deploys Testnet, Releases Whitepaper  Codex, a decentralized data-storage protocol promising censorship resistance and durability guarantees, has deployed its first testnet and released a whitepaper, according to the team: ""The combination of erasure coding and the proving-system upgrades will provide higher durability with cost-savings over time, benefiting both storage providers and users.

42407500,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIaI2,1727897941,"Bitcoin Bounce Above $62K Quickly Fades; Ether, XRP, ADA, LINK Lose as Torrid October Continues","Bitcoin's modest pump above $62,000 quickly faded, while ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL were 5%-7% lower over the past 24 hours.  BTC could tumble to $55,000 if the Middle East conflict escalates further, but the $60,000 level acted as solid support so far, QCP analysts said.  CryptoQuant set a $85,000-$100,000 price target for Q4, but demand needs to pick up.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} modest rebound from the geopolitical turmoil-induced sell-off was arrested at $62,400 during the Wednesday U.S. session, tumbling back below $61,000 in the later hours.  BTC recently changed hands at $60,200, down 3% over the past 24 hours, while the broad crypto market benchmark CoinDesk 20 index was 3.8% lower during the same period. Altcoins fared worse, with ether {{ETH}}, Ripple's XRP {{XRP}}, Cardano {{ADA}}, Chainlink {{LINK}} and Near {{NEAR}} declining 5%-7% during the day.  U.S. stock indexes remained mostly flat after yesterday's losses on rising conflict between Israel and Iran. Gold pared some of its gains while oil retraced to $70 from its intraday top at $72, perhaps a sign of easing investor concerns over further military escalation.  The Japanese yen tumbled 1.8% against the U.S. dollar on incoming prime minister Shigeru Ishiba ruling out further interest rate hikes in the near term, saying that the country's economy isn’t ready yet for more restrictive monetary policy. Keeping central bank policy loose would support risk assets, as the Bank of Japan's surprise rate hike in August triggered a broad-scale market crash as traders were forced to unwound their positions funded by cheap yen-based loans.  Bitcoin's key test  Crypto's dismal start of October, which was widely expected to be a bullish month, has left crypto traders worried about further downside as the euphoria from bitcoin's swift run to $66,000 from $52,000 last month quickly faded.  Whether prices rebound or tumble lower may depend on bitcoin's ongoing retest of its ""Bull Market Support Band,"" a key trend indicator defined by the asset's 20-week simple moving average (SMA) and a 21-week exponential moving average (EMA). The band often served as support for prices during previous uptrends, and currently ranges between $61,100 and $62,900. A bounce from the band would reinvigorate the uptrend from the September lows to target, but a decisive break below could undo all the recovery, with many more weeks chopping below $60,000.  Analysts at crypto hedge fund QCP said that bitcoin could tumble to as low as $55,000 if the Middle East conflict escalates further and investors move risk-off, but the $60,000 level acted as solid support so far.  ""Middle East geopolitics will steal the limelight for now, but the shallow sell-off suggests that the market remains well bid for risk assets,"" QCP said in a Tuesday update.  ""This minor setback shouldn't distract from the bigger picture,"" QCP analysts added. ""Asset prices are expected to remain supported heading into 2025, as both the largest (the Federal Reserve) and third-largest (People's Bank of China) central banks in the world have started their cutting cycles in earnest.""  Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant noted signs of BTC demand recovering from the summer slump, driven by U.S.-listed spot ETFs.  If demand picks up and favorable year-end seasonality materializes, BTC could target the $85,000-$100,000 range in the last quarter, according to CryptoQuant.

42407488,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIZky,1727895750,Kamala Harris’s Unrealized Capital Gains Tax Would Hurt All Crypto Investors,"Last month, Kamala Harris endorsed a controversial 25% tax proposal on unsold assets. While Silicon Valley was up in arms about the plan, it barely registered with crypto investors who the plan would hit hard.  At its core, an unrealized capital gains tax would require individuals to pay taxes on the appreciation of their cryptocurrency holdings, even if they have not made a single sale.  Such a move could crush cryptocurrency markets.  The so-called “wealth tax” is a radical departure from traditional tax principles, which only apply to gains realized when an asset is sold. The plan would have devastating consequences for crypto investors and the broader economy and undermine the inherent value of cryptocurrencies as a store-of-value that operates outside the clutches of any singular government.  Harris and supporters of the proposal, first introduced in President Biden’s last budget proposal, have defended the tax as a levy on Americans worth more than $100 million. The wealth tax would “address substantial inequities in our tax system,” one White House official responding to the furor told Axios.  But the plan would hurt all investors by encouraging a sell-off by larger investors to fund their tax payments. This sell-off would drive down the price of cryptocurrencies and impact returns for everyday investors, including those who have only invested small amounts in the hope of improving their economic situation.  Prolific bitcoin investors such as Tim Draper, Michael Saylor, and Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss would be slapped with tax bills of up to $1 billion. Yes, that's a billion, not a million.  Their crime? Recognizing the value of bitcoin before the majority of investors and purchasing the asset early. The Winkelvoss twins, who bought their bitcoin in 2013 when it was trading at $10, would be forced to pay $1 billion to the Internal Revenue Service.  Draper, who invested in 2014 at a cost-basis of approximately $632 per coin, would be slapped with a $423 million tax bill, according to Meanwhile analysis. Saylor, who personally holds 17,732 BTC, would be required to pay the IRS $212 million.  Because of how well bitcoin has outperformed in the last decade, the tax liabilities would be enormous. Over the last five years, the price of bitcoin is up 700%. Over the last 10 years, that figure is 17,000%.  Anyone with a basic understanding of the value of cryptocurrencies can see how this proposed tax would discourage long-term investment and encourage short-term trading. Diamond hands would be punished for believing in the long-term promise of bitcoin and forced to pay a king’s ransom on assets they hadn’t yet cashed out on.  What’s more, the move would stymy innovation and financial prosperity across the board. Wealthy Americans who own trillions of dollars worth of stock would be forced to sell enormous tranches of holdings to also fund their tax bills, while startup founders, largely compensated in equity, would be discouraged from taking their businesses public.  Marc Andreessen, the founder of top venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said in a July podcast episode that startup companies would be “completely implausible” if the tax was enacted, while entrepreneur Mark Cuban told Fox Business that the proposal would “kill the stock market.”  The crypto industry is already being hammered by a SEC determined to rule through enforcement rather than provide clear rules of the road. Most companies want to do the right thing, but innovation is impossible under constant regulatory threat.  The IRS and SEC are often forced to enforce ambiguous laws that don’t necessarily fit with new technologies. But in this case, the impact is clear — stifling innovation and hurting the little guy (even with the appearance of only affecting the ultra wealthy).  The proposed unrealized capital gains tax is a flawed and dangerous policy that would have unintended negative consequences for all crypto investors, not just those worth more than $100 million.  Instead of stifling innovation and discouraging investment, the government should focus on creating a supportive regulatory environment that fosters the growth of the crypto industry. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of cryptocurrencies to drive economic growth and improve the lives of people around the world.  If the goal of the Biden-Harris administration is to raise huge sums for a social safety net, perhaps they might consider investing some of their own money in bitcoin and creating a strategic national reserve, instead of chasing investors who saw the promise of HODLing a long time ago.

34236943,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645859,1727895611,"Analyst Says Bitcoin Is In The ‘Final Test’, Here’s Where The BTC Price Is Headed Next","Bitcoin has seen a retracement from the $66,000 level, but that does not mean that the bullishness of the pioneer cryptocurrency is completely gone. It is currently sitting around 4% below $66,000, which still makes its $63,000 level very attractive for bulls. Although, given the current movement of Bitcoin, the market could see a deeper correction from here that could send its price spiraling below $60,000 once again. Bitcoin Symmetrical Triangle Could Trigger A Retest Crypto analyst Xanrox has presented a possible scenario where the Bitcoin price could decline further from here. The analyst points to the previous symmetrical triangle that had been formed on the Bitcoin chart with the last decline. This end of this symmetrical triangle sits somewhere around $56,000, which could present a roadblock for the BTC price. Related Reading: Crypto Researcher Reveals Why XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Not A Pipe Dream However, as the analyst explains, a retest of the symmetrical triangle that takes the price back down is not entirely a bad thing. This is because a first breakout of a pattern such as the symmetrical triangle, and then a retest of it is often a positive. This is because it give traders another chance to get in on a good price. Furthermore, the crypto analyst points out that there is an ascending channel that is being broken down on the Bitcoin chart. This also lends credence to the fact that the BTC price could still correct from here. Taking the ascending channel and the symmetrical triangle into account, then it is possible that Bitcoin does fall below $60,000 again. As the crypto analyst explains, the first wave 1 impulse has already been completed, so a correction is in the works. Taking a look at the Fibonacci retracement, the crypto analyst tells traders to look toward the 0.382 level, as well as the 0.5 and 0.618 levels. However, the first two are much more important. When Is The Right Time To Buy BTC? When it comes to buying Bitcoin, the crypto analyst points out that the 0.382 and 0.5 Fibonacci levels are the best time to buy. Additionally, Xanrox points to “an unfilled FVG (Fair Value Gap)” and tells traders that it is within this region that they want to get in on the digital asset. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why Currently, this unfilled FVG is sitting between $60,277 and $61,590. Given this, setting the buy orders between these levels would be advisable. The crypto analyst explains that this Bitcoin gap may not be filled completely, but that even a partial fill would be a good thing. “I am currently very bullish on Bitcoin, and if you buy now and sell above 120K, I would consider it a good trade!” the crypto analyst said in closing.

42407491,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIZra,1727894311,"Fan Tokens Have Much Larger Market Than NFTs, Says Chiliz CEO as Blockchain Prepares New Memecoin 'Pepper'","Chiliz to launch Pepper memecoin starting October 10th.  The Chiliz CEO Alexandre Dreyfus pointed to data to reflect how fan tokens were beating NFTs in volume.  Chiliz powered platform Socios has regulatory licenses in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Lithuania, said Dreyfus noting that ""apart from crypto exchanges, its the most regulated"" crypto entity in the world.  SINGAPORE — The Chiliz blockchain is aiming to become ""the sports blockchain,"" its CEO Alexandre Dreyfus said in an interview with CoinDesk while calling fan tokens' market is much larger than non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Dreyfus also said that, starting October 10, Chiliz is planning on launching a memecoin called Pepper. The reason for the new memecoin is ""well, Chili Pepper,"" he said.  The Chiliz blockchain's native token is CHZ and it powers Socios.com, the largest sports fan token creator platform. Pepper will be airdropped to CHZ token holders but not for U.S. citizens and it can be farmed. Upbit crypto exchange in South Korea was the first exchange which announced its listing.  In March, leading up to the 2024 UEFA Euro football championships, prices of the CHZ token rose 25% in seven days, reaching a two-month high of over $0.15. It has since fallen to $0.068, according to CoinDesk data. It remains the number one sports token in the world by market cap.  ""The chain is becoming what we aimed it to become, which is the sports blockchain,"" said Dreyfus. ""It's unique. We are the only ones doing what we do. And we don't want to do anything else.""  NFTs vs. fan tokens  Dreyfus is looking to change the narrative around fan tokens, stating that their growth was under-recognized in comparison to NFTs.  ""No offence to the NFT community but what people don't realize [is that] fan tokens are a much bigger market than NFTs,"" he said pointing to data that largely reflected the current 24-hour volume for NFTs at around $6.8 million, while for fan tokens it's at $134 million, according to Coingecko.  ""Of course, we're comparing apples and oranges. One is fungible the other is non-fungible. But nobody does anything with it [NFTs]. With fan tokens every single week people are going to stadiums and voting.""  Although NFTs might have less trading volume currently, at the peak of the bull market, they became the next big thing in the digital assets sector as celebrities and big brands embraced the idea of unique digital assets that are verified using blockchain. At the time, the idea of having distinct and irreplaceable assets gained prominence within various communities, including digital art, music, videos and gambling.  Read more: What Are NFTs and How Do They Work?  Meanwhile, fan tokens are digital assets that represent membership to a community such as a sports team’s fan base. Token holders of specific teams can express their support while receiving specific perks, including game tickets and some participation in a sports club’s decision-making.  'Biggest sports broker in the world'  Dreyfus founded Chiliz with the vision to recognize that ""95% of sports fans are not in the stadium, the city or the country of the team they're supporting,"" so, we wanted to create something that is ""both valuable for the fan and scalable for the team.""  ""After signing Paris Saint-Germain F.C. (French football club) as our first team in 2018, we now work with more than 80 sports properties all over the world with 300 employees in nine offices,"" Dreyfus said.  Each team that signs up has its own token but the CHZ token acts as a governance token and Dreyfus said that his firm has now created a network of the ""biggest sports broker in the world."" It's given fans the ability to make some decisions, even if they are soft decisions, such as deciding which song will play when a goal is scored as it happened when Cristiano Ronaldo scored thrice for Juventus once.  ""This is the perfect example of how something on chain changed something in real life,"" Dreyfus said. ""Only the token holders could choose the music. And they were not able to do it before. So, soft or not soft, it doesn't matter.""  In 2021, Socios signed 27 NBA teams and 13 NFL teams but did not launch a token, it also signed several cricket teams in the Indian Premier League. Dreyfus said Socios has regulatory licenses in Italy, Spain, Portugal, and Lithuania, and noted that ""apart from crypto exchanges, it's the most regulated"" crypto entity in the world.  ""We had to go through the same work as an exchange, except that we don't do bitcoin and Ethereum, we just do fan tokens.""  Turkey (one million users) and Brazil (500,000 users) are its biggest markets.

That's just one of the tantalizing details from our Sam Kessler's investigative opus, hot off the press, detailing North Korea's successful campaign to place its workers on crypto-company payrolls.

Ranking September returns for the CoinDesk 20: Bitcoin was strangely strong – and yet still a laggard versus blue chip peers (except for Ethereum's ETH).  Network News  ""Naoki Murano,"" one of the suspected North Korean IT workers identified by ZachXBT, provided companies with an authentic-looking Japanese passport. (Image courtesy of Taylor Monahan)  HERMIT EMPIRE: An investigation published Wednesday by CoinDesk's Sam Kessler reveals just how aggressively and frequently North Korean job applicants have targeted crypto companies in particular – successfully navigating interviews, passing reference checks, even presenting impressive histories of code contributions on the open-source software repository GitHub.  Kessler spoke to more than a dozen crypto companies that said they inadvertently hired IT workers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as the nation is officially called. These interviews with founders, blockchain researchers and industry experts reveal that North Korean IT workers are far more prevalent in the crypto industry than previously thought. Virtually every hiring manager approached by CoinDesk for this story acknowledged that they had interviewed suspected North Korean developers, hired them unwittingly, or knew someone who had.  ""The percentage of your incoming resumes, or people asking for jobs, or wanting to contribute – any of that stuff – that are probably from North Korea is greater than 50% across the entire crypto industry,"" said Zaki Manian, a prominent blockchain developer who says he inadvertently hired two DPRK IT workers to help develop the Cosmos Hub blockchain in 2021. ""Everyone is struggling to filter out these people.""  Among the unwitting DPRK employers identified by CoinDesk were several well-established blockchain projects, such as Cosmos Hub, Injective, ZeroLend, Fantom, Sushi and Yearn Finance. “This has all been happening behind the scenes,” said Manian. This investigation marks the first time any of these companies have publicly acknowledged that they inadvertently hired DPRK IT workers.  ELSEWHERE:  Ethereum-based restaking project EigenLayer unlocked its native EIGEN token for transfers this week, apparently allowing some traders to dump: The price surged moments after it was listed on exchanges, leading to a price discovery period that culminated in a 22% slide from its momentary record high. Some community members complained that early EigenLayer investors, while still subject to a token lockup period for a while longer, were nonetheless able to stake their tokens – and sell any rewards received from the activity.

Crypto Winter-Era Seed Startups Mostly Persist Despite Tumult and Crisis  Ethereum had the most projects among the 2022 cohort, Bitcoin had the lowest fail rate, and Binance had the highest fail rate. (Lattice)   Crypto's hellish 2022 was awash in washouts: Terra-Luna crashed, FTX rugged and crypto lenders bombed. Yet the disasters failed to sink many of the teams perhaps most vulnerable to mayhem: early-stage startups.  Over 80% of the crypto startups that announced seed rounds in 2022 continue to build today, according to a new report from Lattice VC.  The finding may add some retrospective hope to what was otherwise crypto’s darkest year yet. Venture capital companies deployed over $5 billion into 1,200 teams that unveiled their seed rounds during the tumultuous months of 2022 – 2.5 times more capital than in 2021.  “Because of the massive influx of capital for 2022, there was just a natural expectation” of a higher fail rate, said Mike Zajko, co-founder at Lattice. The prediction hasn’t really come to fruition.

Diagram of Strata's system architecture (Strata)  PROTOCOL VILLAGE EXCLUSIVE: Alpen Labs, a Bitcoin-focused developer, has unveiled ""Strata,"" described as a ""platform for endgame money on Bitcoin built with ZK rollup tech."" According to the team: ""Strata is being unveiled after two years of R&D by Alpen. In the first phase, Strata will be a ZK rollup on Bitcoin with the most trust-minimized BitVM bridge available. Long term, Strata’s will be a settlement layer for ZK proofs directly on Bitcoin. Settlement of ZK proofs is a unique opportunity to extend the properties of BTC as money. We're looking to create a platform for all digital money with cheap payments, self-custody and large-scale verifiable finance on Bitcoin."" CoinDesk reported in April that Alpen emerged from stealth with $10.6 million in funding.  A proposal by Tez Capital won approval from the Tezos blockchain community after being floated as an alternative to the core Nomadic Labs team's ""Quebec"" upgrade plan. According to a Reddit post, ""this is true Tezos governance at work. The people have spoken."" The Quebec proposal called for a reduction of block times to eight seconds from 10 seconds, while also instituting maximum issuance bounds for the Adaptive Issuance mechanism. The alternative ""Qena"" proposal from Tez Capital kept the technical aspects of the Quebec proposals, but without the changes to Adaptive Issuance. It called for ""emphasizing stability and technical progress without disruptive economic changes."" One respondent to the Reddit post wrote, ""Ngl, it’s pretty amazing to see a community member's proposal get pushed through.""  Bedrock released a post-mortem on a vulnerability in the uniBTC smart contract that was exploited, ""allowing the exploiter to mint 30.8 uniBTC and swap them for wBTC in Uniswap pools."" According to the post: ""In response, we paused the vulnerable contract and implemented a fix to mitigate the vulnerability, which was later confirmed to have affected approximately $2 million in liquidity, primarily within the Uniswap pool."" Separately, the Chainlink team sent this message: ""Following today’s security exploit on Bedrock's platform involving uniBTC, Bedrock is integrating Chainlink Proof of Reserve (PoR) to help secure their minting function and fortify the security of their protocol.""  Codex, a decentralized data-storage protocol promising censorship resistance and durability guarantees, has deployed its first testnet and released a whitepaper, according to the team: ""The combination of erasure coding and the proving-system upgrades will provide higher durability with cost-savings over time, benefiting both storage providers and users. ZK proof-based remote auditing with ongoing proof aggregation optimizations will reduce costs in the network, allowing support for real-world use cases, first with static data and then hotter data.""  The foundation supporting the Avalanche network is releasing a $40 million grant program to reward developers for building new protocols in the blockchain ecosystem. The program, called Retro9000, is supposed to encourage developers to build on Avalanche ahead of a much-anticipated upgrade known as Avalanche9000, the Avalanche Foundation said in a press release.  Bitcoin's Uncharacteristically Strong September Yields to Unpleasant October Surprise  Bitcoin (BTC) is suffering its worst start to October, typically its most bullish month, as Israel-Iran tensions have flared. Some $450 million in bullish crypto bets were liquidated.  September, on the other hand, looked bullish – typically in the largest cryptocurrency's worst month of the year.  Looking back on September, the CoinDesk 20 index of blue-chip digital assets outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, as well as gold. Here's what that looked like, courtesy of my colleague Tracy Stephens at CoinDesk Indices  (Tracy Stephens/CoinDesk Indices)  Bitcoin (BTC), despite gaining an entirely respectable 8.3% during the month, was a bit of a laggard compared to the rest of the CoinDesk 20 members.  The alternative layer-1 blockchain's NEAR token topped the charts, with a 36% climb.  Ethereum's ETH put in another month of subpar performance, in what has been an inarguably lackluster year for the largest smart-contract blockchain.  Polygon's MATIC, which is being swapped out for a new token called POL, was the index's sole loser during the month, sliding 3.2%.  Calendar  Oct. 9-11: Permissionless, Salt Lake City.

34234705,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645893,1727890239,Solana (SOL) Holds Above $140 As Funding Rate Signals Bullish Momentum,"Solana (SOL) is currently trading near a critical support zone at $145, following a 26% surge since the Federal Reserve announced interest rate cuts on September 18. After this sharp rise, SOL experienced a slight 10% dip, but the overall market sentiment remains optimistic. Many analysts and investors hope Solana will reach new all-time highs by the end of the year, driven by positive macroeconomic trends and the growing confidence in the crypto market. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Faces Risk Of 30% Drop – On-Chain Metrics Confirm A Slow Demand Key data from Coinglass reveals a rising funding rate, which indicates increasing bullish sentiment among traders. This suggests that the recent price correction might only be a temporary pause before another leg higher. Investors are closely monitoring SOL’s price action, with expectations that a sustained break above $150 could pave the way for a new rally toward uncharted territory. All eyes are now on Solana as it navigates this crucial support level, with both short-term traders and long-term holders anticipating a positive outlook in the coming weeks. Solana Is Preparing For A Rally Solana (SOL) is currently holding firm above a crucial support level following a small dip that affected the entire market yesterday. Despite this minor setback, the sentiment among investors and traders remains overwhelmingly positive. Many expect SOL to rally and surpass multi-month highs, given the recent strength in its price action. Key data from Coinglass highlights that Solana’s funding rate has been on an upward trend since mid-September. Yesterday, it reached 0.0127%, the highest level since late July. A rising funding rate is typically a bullish indicator, signaling growing demand for a token. The funding rate is a mechanism used in perpetual futures contracts, where it can be either positive or negative. It adjusts based on the price difference between the perpetual contract and the spot price, along with interest rates. When the funding rate is positive, buyers (longs) are paying sellers (shorts), which encourages futures and spot prices to converge. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? This rising funding rate for SOL suggests that more traders are betting on the token’s future appreciation, expecting higher prices in the coming weeks. With Solana maintaining its current support and displaying strong market fundamentals, the potential for a significant rally remains high. Investors are now watching closely to see if Solana can break through its next resistance levels and confirm the start of a new bullish phase. SOL Testing Demand Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $145, holding strong above the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at a critical support level of $140. This key area has proven to be a solid foundation for the price, and if bulls want to ignite an upward rally, they must defend this support zone. For momentum to shift decisively upward, SOL needs to break past the daily 200 moving average (MA), which sits at $154. A close above the 200 MA would likely trigger a bullish rally, potentially pushing the price toward higher targets. However, failure to maintain this key support and close above these levels could result in extended sideways consolidation or, worse, a deeper correction. In such a scenario, the next demand zone would be around $110, a significant support level that could attract buyers if the market enters a bearish phase. Related Reading: SUI Ready To Test $2 Resistance – Bullish Pattern Suggests New ATH Soon For now, the $140 support level remains the line in the sand for Solana’s price action.

According to his plea agreement, 21-year-old Evan Light, of Lebanon, Indiana, and his unnamed co-conspirators were able to infiltrate the unnamed company’s servers after stealing the identity of one of its clients. They then used that client’s information to illegally gain access to the company’s servers and carry out the theft.  After the theft, Light pleaded guilty to laundering the group’s ill-gotten gains, funneling them through “multiple mixing services and gambling websites” to conceal his identity and the identities of his co-conspirators. He also pleaded guilty to wiring the proceeds and then storing them in a cold wallet under his control.  “These convictions reflect the relentless efforts of the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in identifying a cybercriminal, holding him accountable, and prioritizing the victims of his crimes,” said U.S. Attorney Alison Ramsdell in a Tuesday press release. “Although this defendant tried to hide in the shadows of a cyber underworld, he was not beyond the reach of our team, and today’s guilty verdicts should serve as a reminder that this Office and its law enforcement partners will bring cyber criminals to justice, regardless how sophisticated their crimes may be.”  The theft took place in February 2022. According to a local news outlet, the FBI raided Light’s residence, which he shared with his mother, in May 2023, approximately two weeks after he was indicted by a grand jury for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.

The regulatory environment for these digital assets, which have been criticized for quite some time now, may be more favorable as a result of the Trump administration, according to Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas. Related Reading: Humor Or Sarcasm?

It is possible that the manner in which regulators perceive cryptocurrencies may change if he wins the 2024 election. This is particularly critical for XRP and Solana, as they are both competing for ETF approvals that could potentially create new investment opportunities. Analysts believe a Trump victory could encourage the SEC to be more tolerant on these petitions. You’ve heard of the Fed Put.

The creation of clear rules that will help investors navigate this complex market is something that many are anxiously awaiting. The administration of Trump could reverse a regulatory direction towards deregulation upon regaining power, and this might be favorable for crypto markets. This too falls in line with what is going on in the legal battles Ripple, behind XRP, has faced, and its efforts to clear the controversial status it currently holds in light of SEC regulations. Analysts further indicate that a potential Trump presidency might mean friendlier waters for businesses; this will probably hasten the process of an approved crypto ETF. This will give the investors much confidence and institutional capital into the market, too. The prospect of ETFs linked to popular cryptocurrencies like XRP and Solana could provide much-needed liquidity and stability, which many investors are currently seeking.

42407495,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIa87,1727884207,EigenLayer's Token Launch Draws Scrutiny Over Supply Concerns,"EigenLayer his been hit by criticism after it was revealed that staking rewards received by early investors are not restricted by token lock-ups.  The situation echoes Celestia's token launch, which was followed by a 75% plunge as investors could sell staking rewards.  The EIGEN token initially rose to $4.39 and has since slumped by more than 20% to $3.57.  In some ways, the release of EigenLayer's native EIGEN token this week went as expected.  The price surged moments after it was listed on exchanges, leading to a price discovery period culminating in a 22% slide from its momentary record high.  But there appears to be a more serious issue brewing, with investors and community members complaining about a lack of transparency regarding token supply.  EIGEN's total supply is fixed at 1.68 billion and its circulating supply is 186 million. These figures give the asset a fully diluted value of $5.8 billion and a market cap, excluding tokens not in circulation, of $650 million. The issue many community members raise stems from a portion of those locked tokens, which belong to early investors that bought during heavily-discounted funding rounds.  Investors that bought in EigenLayer's $14.4 million seed round, $50 million Series A and most recent $100 million raise in February now can stake their locked tokens to yield rewards. As it stands, there are 130 million EIGEN tokens staked. Many believed these were all a part of the claimed tokens but in fact, 70 million of these tokens belong to this small group of early investors.  Data availability protocol Celestia suffered a similar issue following its token launch, as early investors staked their dominant TIA stacks to receive tradable rewards, which many then traded away. TIA has plunged 75% since February.  EigenLayer investor TardFiWhale.eth wrote on X that the project recently updated its documents to state that ""Eigen Labs investors are not restricted from staking"" and that rewards are not subject to lock-ups. The X post claims this information wasn't in an archived document from mid-September.  EigenLayer's blog post on ""token disclosures"" was last revised on Sept. 30.  ""Transparency will enable us to engage in more honest and open discussions about these issues,"" TardFiWhale.eth wrote. ""I personally believe that allowing investors with locked EIGEN to stake makes sense from a governance perspective, given the complexity and goals of Eigenlayer. However, I also believe that the rewards earned from staking should be locked until the cliff is reached"" at the end of the 12-month vesting period.  EigenLayer allocated 86 million tokens to early adopters including node operators and stakers, but even this has led to criticism as whales were able to receive disproportionate rewards compared to the general population. Tron founder Justin Sun received an airdrop worth $8.75 million, almost all of which was deposited to HTX, the exchange formerly known as Huobi, according to data provider Arkham.  HTX made the following statement in regards to Sun's wallet: “We categorically deny any connection between the mentioned wallet address and Justin Sun, Global Advisor of HTX, or any member of his team. There is absolutely no evidence to support such claims. HTX maintains a policy of not commenting on the transactions of individual wallet addresses.”  EIGEN recently traded at $3.57, having initially surged as high as $4.39, CoinMarketCap data shows.

42407498,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIaBQ,1727882288,The Rise of Index Investing in Crypto,"Cryptocurrency has evolved as a global asset class with significant implications for modern investment portfolios. Despite undeniable growth, crypto remains volatile, posing challenges for even seasoned investors. An increasingly popular solution to navigating these risks is crypto index investing. Crypto index funds are products that bundle multiple cryptocurrencies into a single vehicle, offering a diversified, systematic approach to gaining exposure to the digital asset market while mitigating some of its inherent risks.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  The value of crypto index investing  Risk diversification: Crypto index-investing reduces reliance on the performance of any single digital asset, balancing exposure across a range of tokens with different risk profiles and use cases. This approach helps hedge against the volatility of individual cryptocurrencies, ensuring that portfolio performance is not overly reliant on the unpredictable price movements of one asset.  Strategic exposure: Many institutional investors are looking to incorporate digital assets as part of their broader diversification strategy. Crypto index funds offer a streamlined way to gain access to this rapidly evolving sector while avoiding the steep learning curve associated with understanding and selecting individual cryptocurrencies. For investors seeking exposure to crypto as an asset class, this approach provides both simplicity and strategic depth.  Reduced operational complexity: Managing a portfolio of cryptocurrencies can be resource-intensive. Factors like liquidity, custody, regulatory compliance, and security create significant operational challenges. Index products offer a solution by packaging a diverse selection of digital assets into a single investment vehicle. This reduces the need for active portfolio management, complex due diligence on individual tokens, and the overhead costs of custody and security for a variety of digital assets.  Increasing popularity among institutional investors  An increasing number of institutional investors are looking for ways to participate in crypto without taking on unnecessary risk. Index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on digital assets have emerged as a compelling option. We’ve experienced this trend as well with 30% of our retail and institutional clients opting to diversify their portfolios through a crypto index bundle.  Tailoring the index to investor goals  Crypto index funds have the ability to tailor exposure based on specific investment goals and risk tolerance. Some indexes focus exclusively on large-cap cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, providing a stable base of well-established assets. Others may prioritize high-growth sectors like decentralized finance or newer blockchain protocols, offering higher potential upside alongside increased risk.  Selecting the right index strategy depends on a detailed understanding of the underlying assets and market dynamics. Diversified exposure can enhance the risk-adjusted return profile of a portfolio, but the nuances of index composition should align with an investor’s broader strategy.  Index investing offers a strategic, risk-managed approach for professional investors looking to capitalize on the crypto market’s growth. By offering diversified exposure, reducing operational complexity, and providing a controlled entry into the crypto ecosystem, index funds and ETFs are becoming valuable tools for those navigating the digital asset landscape.

42407503,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIaVG,1727882169,Crypto at a Pivotal Moment,"Seismic events often trigger crypto-asset market cycle transitions. The 2016-2017 cycle was largely industry-driven, expanding crypto's reach beyond early adopters. In contrast, the 2020-2021 surge was propelled by unprecedented COVID-era interest rate cuts.  Now, two powerful catalysts converge: the looming 2024 U.S. elections and a nascent global liquidity cycle for risk assets. This potent combination could shatter bitcoin's $58,000 to $70,000 trading range, where it has largely remained since late March, potentially igniting the next major market movement.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  2024 U.S. elections likely to gain importance as election day nears  This election cycle marks several firsts for crypto, primarily how the industry emerged as a relevant topic in political discourse and campaign financing. Another interesting trend is how Polymarket, a breakthrough crypto application, now provides real-time estimates of consensus on election results, with over $1 billion at stake.  The chart below shows the relationship between two factors over 3-day periods: changes in Republican win odds on Polymarket and changes in bitcoin prices as a proxy for overall crypto market performance. Different election phases are color-coded: gray for the initial phase (before June 26), red for the period of Republican momentum (between the end of June and the end of July), blue for Democratic gains (between the end of July and mid-August), and black for the final stretch (since mid-August).  If the market linked crypto prices directly to Republican win odds, the dots in the chart above would form an upward-sloping 45-degree line. Conversely, a direct link to Democratic win odds would show a similar, but downward-sloping, line. Instead, we see a scattered cloud of dots, indicating no clear, consistent trend between election outcomes and crypto prices so far.  This dynamic is evident across all phases highlighted in different colors throughout the scatterplot. Although the relationship is stronger during the phase of Republican momentum, it still explains less than 20% of bitcoin price movements.  This doesn't mean the elections are unimportant for crypto price action. It is possible, if not likely, that this relationship strengthens as we approach Election Day, now less than one month away. But this inconsistent relationship suggests that other critical factors have also been dominating crypto market price action.  Interest rate outlook hints at novel regime for crypto prices  Recent global liquidity shifts have driven markets worldwide, including crypto. The Federal Reserve's strong start to this rate-cut cycle, coupled with China's surprising market-lifting measures, likely fueled crypto's recent price surge.  Unlike equities, crypto lacks extensive historical data for gauging returns across different interest rate regimes.  Nevertheless, examining crypto prices against rate environments remains instructive. The chart below shows the effective federal funds rate alongside Treasury constant-maturity yields from 1-year to 30-year tenors. For context, the lower chart displays bitcoin's USD price (in log scale for perspective), with color-coded market cycles: green for the 2016-2017 and 2020-2021 bull markets, red for the 2018 and 2022 bear markets.  This chart suggests that a soft landing with lower rates — the current investor consensus — would create an unprecedented macro backdrop for crypto. This scenario differs from both the industry-driven 2016-2017 cycle and the COVID era, rate-cut-fueled, 2020-2021 surge.  Consequently, macroeconomic factors are expected to significantly influence crypto prices in the near term, as evidenced by strengthening correlations between crypto and broader risk assets.  Looking ahead  Low crypto liquidity following Labor Day indicates a market in wait-and-see mode. While factors such as geopolitical tensions and supply/demand imbalances can still influence the market, two primary drivers most likely to define market direction into 2025 are still the upcoming election and global liquidity conditions. The next one to three months will be crucial in revealing how these trends will unfold.

42407497,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIa1V,1727880723,U.S. Election Betting: Kalshi Preps Presidential Prediction Markets After Re-Launching Congressional Contracts,"With a month to go before the U.S. election, prediction market Kalshi resumed listing its contracts on which party will control each house of Congress after an appeal court lifted its order pausing the activity.  The company is also preparing to list a contract on the presidency, according to a regulatory filing late Wednesday. Another U.S.-regulated prediction market, Interactive Brokers' ForecastEx, is getting ready to launch congressional and presidential markets, according to its filings.  On Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied a motion by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to halt the contracts pending the agency's appeal of the case it lost to Kalshi in a lower court last month.  ""The Commission has failed to demonstrate that it or the public will suffer irreparable injury absent a stay pending appeal, and therefore its motion for a stay is denied without prejudice to renewal should substantiating evidence arise,"" wrote Circuit Judge Patricia Millett. ""The administrative stay is hereby dissolved.""  Apparently emboldened by the decision, Kalshi self-certified the contract ""Will pres candidate or another party Representative win the Presidency by being the first inaugurated as President for the year Term of Office?"" with the CFTC, according to a notice on the regulator's website. Self-certification is the process whereby entities regulated by the CFTC list products without the agency's prior approval.  Kalshi co-founder Luana Lopes Lara also teased this market in a post on X.  A clock on Kalshi's website indicates the presidential contract will launch Thursday afternoon U.S. hours.  On the relaunched contract ""Which party will win the Senate?"" shares in the Republicans were trading at 75 cents Wednesday afternoon in New York and Democrats at 25 cents. Each share pays out $1 if the prediction comes true and zilch if it does not, so a 75 cent price means the market sees a 75% chance of the GOP taking control of the chamber.  A separate contract on control of the House of Representatives gives a 63% chance of the Democrats regaining it and 37% for Republican retaining it.  Kalshi was until recently the sole U.S.-regulated prediction market until ForecastEx joined the ranks in June. The unit of Interactive Brokers self-certified congressional control contracts, a presidential contract, and one on individual Senate races, according to its Wednesday filings with the CFTC.  A long battle  Kalshi sued the CFTC last year after the agency denied its application to list election contracts, on the grounds that they constituted gaming and would be contrary to the public interest.  Following its long-sought victory in the lower court in September, Kalshi listed the contracts on Sept. 13. They traded for only a few hours before the appeals court granted an administrative stay, which it lifted Wednesday.  ""While the question on the merits is close and difficult, the Commission cannot obtain a stay at this time because it has not demonstrated that it or the public will be irreparably harmed while its appeal is heard,"" Judge Millett wrote. ""That failure is fatal to the Commission’s stay request because a showing of irreparable harm is a necessary prerequisite for a stay.""  Dwarfed by Polymarket  While it's been fighting the agency in court, New York-based Kalshi, which settles bets in dollars, has watched crypto-powered rival Polymarket, which is barred from doing business in the U.S., nevertheless rack up record volumes during this election year. Over $1 billion alone has been staked on Polymarket's contract on who will win the presidency.  Volumes were comparably modest Wednesday for Kalshi's relaunched Congressional contracts, which had 45,000 contracts traded (worth as much in dollar payouts) for the Senate and $25,000 for the House.  Kalshi caters to institutional investors, and one of the objections to the Congressional contracts throughout the court case was that they allow positions as large as $100 million, which critics said would create strong financial incentives to interfere with elections.  Regulation pending  The CFTC has separately been considering, but has not finalized, a proposed rule that would ban election betting at all the futures exchanges on its watch. In her order Wednesday, Judge Millett suggested that rulemaking was the one way the agency could stop election betting at federally regulated futures exchanges.  ""[I]f the Commission felt the risks of election contracts were as concrete and pressing as it argues here, it has long had—and still has—the power to forbid them on the exchanges it regulates,"" she wrote. ""Specifically, the Special Rule [in the Commodity Exchange Act] empowers the Commission to find through a formal rule or notice-and-comment rulemaking that certain types of event contracts—such as election contracts—are 'contrary to the public interest' and to forbid them.""  In its arguments before the court, the CFTC warned election contracts would incentivize the spreading of misinformation, and cited as evidence of the risks an apparently fake poll from 2017 that showed the rapper Kid Rock leading Sen. Debbie Stabenow in the 2018 Michigan Senate seat race. (He didn't run, and she won reelection.)  ""Yet in the seven years since the fake Kid Rock poll was used, the Commission has not invoked the very tool Congress gave it to head off such harms,"" Judge Millett wrote Wednesday.

42407493,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIZyC,1727879553,Bitwise Makes XRP ETF Plans Official With SEC Filing,"Bitwise submitted an S-1 filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an exchange-traded fund tied to the price of Ripple's XRP.  The filing comes after the asset manager on Tuesday registered a trust with the state of Delaware, the first hint of its intentions.  Bitwise took a big step toward launching an exchange-traded fund tied to XRP {{XRP}}, the Ripple-associated token that's among the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world.  On Wednesday, the asset manager submitted an S-1 form to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, a requirement for companies seeking to issue a new security and be listed on a public stock exchange.  ""Today we filed an S-1 for a Bitwise XRP ETP!"" Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley wrote in a post on X. ""For more than a decade, XRP has been an enduring crypto asset that many investors want exposure to.""  The move comes a day after Bitwise registered a trust entity titled ""XRP ETF"" with the state of Delaware; many companies list their legal entities in that state, and crypto ETF issuers have more than once tipped off their plans through Delaware filings.  XRP is the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at $33 billion, according to CoinDesk data. Its bigger rivals, bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ethereum's ether {{ETH}}, have since earlier this year both been available to investors as an ETF, a wildly popular type of product in traditional finance.  While the submission of an S-1 filing is the first step in introducing a fund, the document is basically meaningless if it isn't followed by another filing, called the 19b-4, which is required to signal a requisite rule change at the stock exchange seeking to list the investment  Unlike the 19b-4, which ties the SEC's decision to approve or deny the filing to a strict timeline, the regulator has no such obligation to respond to the S-1, meaning that it could take years for Bitwise to receive approval.  VanEck, for example, filed an S-1 to launch an ether ETF in 2021, but the fund didn't hit the market until July 2024, over three years later.  Bitwise's effort to create a fund tracking XRP, however, is ""highly noteworthy,"" said one industry expert, Nate Geraci, president of the ETF Store, in response to Tuesday's filing.  ""Bitwise is a highly credible crypto-native fund firm that doesn't just throw stuff at the wall,"" he added.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/02/bitwise-makes-xrp-etf-plans-official-with-sec-filing,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf83f8fdb72c3ca9995dbc10cd838d2e6d0f3948-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
34229972,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645857,1727879446,"Cardano Completes First Green September Close In 6 Years, What’s The Significance?","Cardano (ADA) completed its first green September in six years as the coin enjoyed a price gain of almost 8%. This is significant as the crypto could enjoy an extended rally in October, leading to more price gains for Cardano. Cardano Records First Green September Cryptorank data shows that Cardano has recorded its first green September since it launched in 2017. This raises the possibility of the crypto enjoying an extended rally since it presents a bullish outlook for ADA. Crypto analyst Plutus also suggested that Cardano could replicate Bitcoin’s monthly returns following its first green September. Related Reading: Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges He added that the crypto can accomplish these positive monthly returns in the coming months with looser monetary policy starting to take place. Cardano imitating Bitcoin’s historical monthly returns in the last quarter of this year will be huge for the coin, considering that this is when the flagship crypto records its most profitable returns. Specifically, October is historically one of the best months for Bitcoin, as the crypto has only recorded two negative monthly returns since 2013. Most of its gains have also been double-digits. Therefore, October could be huge for Cardano if it replicates BTC’s monthly returns. Meanwhile, although October has historically not been a good month for Cardano, this time is much different, with these monetary easing policies presenting a bullish outlook for the crypto market. The US Fed rate cuts and China’s stimulus package were among the factors that contributed to ADA enjoying a monthly green candle in September. As such, the crypto could enjoy an extended rally as these monetary easing policies continue to roll out. It is also worth mentioning that Q4 of 2023 was very bullish for Cardano as it recorded double-digit gains in October, November, and December. Similar price gains this fourth quarter will see ADA reclaim $1 and record a new yearly high in the process. This will provide a much-needed boost for the coin, considering it boasts a year-to-date (YTD) loss of almost 40%. Other Factors That Support An Extended Rally From a technical perspective, Plutus noted that the current Heikin Ashi monthly candle is green, indicating a directional change on the cards. The analyst also revealed that the Weekly Gaussian channel, which flipped bullish back in February, is still green, suggesting that more impulsive moves to the upside are on the horizon for Cardano.

34227490,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645888,1727874012,Will Israel-Iran Conflict Push Bitcoin Further Down? Analysts Discuss,"The Bitcoin price took a sharp dip to $60,164 on Tuesday following heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, with Iran launching missile attacks on Israel. The escalation rattled global markets, impacting both traditional and crypto assets. Bitcoin was not immune with a notable -4% drop. Market participants, who had anticipated a strong bullish trend for the month dubbed “Uptober,” were forced to reassess as broader market sentiment turned risk-off. However, the reaction to the geopolitical news may be overblown, according to several analysts. Will Bitcoin Drop Further? Macro strategist Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) cautions on the sudden shift in market sentiment. Via X, he writes, “It’s been bizarre observing everyone turn outright exuberant and calling for ‘Uptober‘. From doom to gloom, in a heartbeat Conflict in the Middle East notwithstanding, this is an election year in the US. Major uncertainty lies ahead.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why Krüger highlights the volatility typically seen in financial markets during US election years, noting, “In election years, the month of October is accordingly the most volatile, and equities historically display slightly negative returns.” He also added that speculative markets tend to react to uncertainties, and given the proximity of the elections and upcoming payroll data on Friday, further volatility can be expected. “Of course if payrolls come in very strong this coming Friday, equities would rip, as we are in a ‘good news is good news’ regime. But the time to press & hold is after the elections, possibly starting on Election night itself,” Krüger states. Prominent crypto analyst CRG (@MacroCRG) notes the potential for the Bitcoin price to recover despite the temporary market turbulence. “That could be the quarterly low in boys. Markets love to put in highs/lows early on in the candle. Plus, geopolitical moves have a high tendency of getting faded. We may still see some turbulence depending on Israel’s response, but the market is likely anticipating this.” Just like Krüger, he outlines that increased liquidity in the market could provide support for Bitcoin, stating, “Liquidity will start ramping up from now, which BTC should sniff out immediately.” Overall, CRG remains bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory, asserting that despite the short-term uncertainties, “$100k BTC is coming.” Related Reading: Major Catalyst That Could Drive Bitcoin To New ATH In Q4 Emerges Singapore-based trading firm QCP Capital also provides its perspective on the conflict’s impact. In their latest investor note, the firm writes: “The Israeli-Iranian conflict has intensified, with over 180 missiles launched by Iran. Despite this, the reaction in traditional financial markets has been relatively muted. The S&P closed only 1% lower, while crude oil (WTI) increased by 2%.” However, the crypto market saw a sharper decline, with Bitcoin facing heavier selling pressure. “BTC closed 4% lower, with support holding around the $60k level. A further escalation in the conflict could potentially push BTC to the $55k mark,” QCP notes. Despite the immediate impact, QCP Capital’s report also stresses that the broader economic backdrop remains favorable for risk assets in the medium term. “Middle East geopolitics will steal the limelight for now, but the shallow sell-off suggests that the market remains well bid for risk assets. This minor setback shouldn’t distract from the bigger picture.” They also point to global monetary policies as a significant factor. “The flush of liquidity from the PBoC and potential fiscal support will likely support asset prices in China, with bullish sentiment potentially spilling over globally to support risk assets, including crypto. […] Assets prices are expected to remain supported heading into 2025, as both the largest (the Fed) and 3rd largest (PBoC) central banks in the world have started their cutting cycles in earnest,” QCP concludes. At press time, BTC traded at $61,286.

42407490,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIZhf,1727874000,Franklin Templeton Adds Aptos Blockchain to Support Tokenized Money Market Fund,"Aptos {{APT}}, the Layer 1 blockchain inspired by the discontinued Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain developed by Meta, has become the latest network where investors can trade shares of Franklin Templeton’s OnChain U.S. Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX).  The fund, which is the second-largest tokenized fund on the market with a $435 million market cap, is already available on Ethereum via Arbitrum, Stellar and Polygon as well as Avalanche.  Franklin’s latest addition is due to Aptos’ unique characteristics which also meet the asset manager’s rigorous suitability standards for its Benji platform, the firm’s blockchain-integrated recordkeeping system, said Roger Bayston, head of digital assets at Franklin Templeton. One Benji token represents one share of the fund.  Aptos is a fairly young Layer 1 blockchain launched in 2022. It employs the Move programming language, which it claims allows for faster and more protected transactions.  Aptos Labs, the developers behind the blockchain, have long made it their mission to bridge the gap between decentralized finance (DeFi) and large, traditional institutions, as have other Layer 1 blockchains.  In April, the firm started partnering with Microsoft and Brevan Howard, as well as South Korean telecommunications operator SK Telecom to help institutions make it easier to experiment in decentralized finance.  “Franklin Templeton’s willingness to innovate in the name of a truly decentralized and accessible financial future is inspiring,” said Bashar Lazaar, Head of Grants and Ecosystem at Aptos Foundation.  “To reach that future, we need to connect not just the TradFi and DeFi worlds, but EVM and non-EVM networks as well. Integrating the Benji Investments platform with the Aptos Network is a massive step in the right direction and we look forward to welcoming them to the Aptos ecosystem,” he said.",POSITIVE,APT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | APT | ARB,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/02/franklin-templeton-adds-aptos-blockchain-to-support-tokenized-money-market-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3c7772791f11e009f8a25e4969a89df90dfe8885-1371x771.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Short-term holders sent $3 billion worth of bitcoin to exchanges at a loss over the past two days.  In the past two days, Sept. 30-Oct. 1, bitcoin {{BTC}} registered consecutive declines of 3.7% as geopolitical tensions ramped up in the Middle East, culminating in Iran's 200 ballistic- missile attack on Israel on Tuesday.  With the largest cryptocurrency little changed on Wednesday, this year marks the worst-ever start to an October, a month that's historically provided positive returns.  One headwind comes from so-called short-term holders, which Glassnode defines as investors who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days. This is a group that tends to panic-sell when the BTC price drops below their cost basis. Glassnode data shows this cohort has bought roughly 100,000 bitcoin since Sept. 19, when bitcoin was trading at $62,000.  By Sept. 27, bitcoin had surged to above $66,000, and, as the chart shows, this group was buying aggressively as the price increased. However, they started dumping their holdings as the price started to fall.  In the past two days, short-term holders have sent roughly 64,000 bitcoin to exchanges, the equivalent of $4 billion. Of that, some $3 billion was sent at a loss, meaning it was sent when the price was lower than the entity's average on-chain acquisition price.  This is the highest amount of loss sent to exchanges by the group since Aug. 5, during the yen carry trade unwind, which saw $2.5 billion of losses sent in one day.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,937.99 -6.61%  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,262.66 -3.99%  Ether (ETH): $2,459.36 -6.58%  S&P 500: 5,708.75 -0.93%  Gold: $2,651.59 -0.33%  Nikkei 225: 37,808.76 -2.18%  Top Stories  Bitcoin reclaimed $61,000 after dropping as low as $60,300 on Tuesday amid an acute sharpening of tensions in the Middle East. Iran fired around 200 ballistic missiles in retaliation for Israel's recent attacks on Hezbollah, designated a terror group by more than 60 countries and organizations. Polymarket bettors are giving a 49% chance that Israel will retaliate against Iran by the end of the week. Bitcoin's slide dented hopes of a rally to kick off October, a traditionally bullish month for the world's largest cryptocurrency. BTC is currently over 4% lower in the last 24 hours, while the broader digital asset market has lost 6%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index.  Some observers have noted the differing performances of bitcoin and gold as a measurement of the two assets' respective maturities. Gold, traditionally seen as a risk-off asset, gained 0.8% in the aftermath of Iran's attack on Israel while BTC lost 4%, despite often being referred to as a form of digital gold. “Gold is a much more mature asset, with a 5,000 year history as a store of value, so there’s not much room left for incremental network effects,"" Presto Research said. ""BTC [has] only a 15-year history. This means it’s in the early stages of mainstream adoption, and its narrative is still poorly understood."" At the time of writing, gold is 0.3% lower in the last 24 hours at $2,652.56 per ounce.  Crypto futures saw over $450 million in long liquidations in the past 24 hours as the bitcoin plunge led to losses among major tokens. CoinGlass data shows that bitcoin traders betting on higher prices lost more than $122 million, while bets on ether lost nearly $100 million. Smaller altcoins recorded over $85 million in liquidations – the most since July – with memecoin PEPE posting an unusually high $10 million. The data shows that nearly 86% of all futures bets were bullish. Traders were positioning for higher prices in the weeks ahead as October traditionally favors BTC, with negative returns only twice since 2013.  Chart of the Day  Short-term holders (STHs) have sent $3 billion worth of bitcoin to exchanges at a loss over the past two days, which coincides with consecutive 3.7% daily declines in BTC's price.  Sales from addresses that have held the BTC for less than 155 days are a bitcoin headwind because those addresses tend to panic-sell when the BTC price dips below their cost basis.  STHs have acquired roughly 100,000 BTC since Sept. 19, when bitcoin was trading at around $62,000.

34225178,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645887,1727868643,"UNI Bullish Rebound Signals Upsurge, Targets $8.7 Resistance Ahead","UNI is making a strong comeback as bullish momentum pushes the token toward the critical $8.7 resistance level. After bouncing back from a recent low of $6.7, market enthusiasm is building, and traders are watching closely for a potential breakout. With buying pressure increasing and sentiment turning positive, UNI’s rally could gain further upward traction if it manages to overcome this key barrier, signaling a renewed bullish trend and paving the way for additional price advances. The aim of this article is to analyze UNI’s recent price rebound and its potential to break through the $8.7 resistance level. By examining key technical indicators and market sentiment, the article seeks to provide insights into whether its current upward momentum can be sustained, and what traders should expect if the token successfully breaches this critical price point. Market Sentiment Shifts: Bulls Back In Control Following the bullish comeback at $6.7, UNI’s price on the 4-hour chart has continued to gain strength to surge toward the $8.7 resistance level. UNI is also trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), suggesting a positive upward trend that could lead to a potential breakout. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the signal line is currently at 45%, climbing from the oversold zone and approaching the 50% threshold. This upward movement indicates that selling pressure is easing, and buyers are beginning to regain control. As the RSI moves closer to 50%, this shows a potential shift toward more balanced market conditions, with the possibility of a bullish reversal if the pressure continues. Related Reading: Uniswap Price on the Rise: UNI Eyes Set on Further Gains Furthermore, on the daily chart, UNI is exhibiting strong upward momentum, marked by a bullish candlestick formation following its successful rebound. The price is now attempting to break above the 100-day SMA, a critical resistance level that could solidify the rising trend. A sustained move above the 100-day SMA would reinforce market confidence, signaling increased buying pressure and the potential for more price appreciation. Finally, on the 1-day chart, a detailed examination of the RSI formation indicates that UNI may maintain its optimistic trajectory as the indicator’s signal line is rising again, positioned at 55% after dropping to the 50% threshold, suggesting a sustained upward outlook. Potential Scenarios: What Happens If UNI Breaches $8.7? If UNI manages to break through the $8.7 resistance level, it could ignite a price surge, propelling it toward the $10.3 mark. A successful breakout above this critical level is likely to draw in more buyers, pushing UNI closer to its next resistance target of $11.8 and beyond. Related Reading: Uniswap Price (UNI) Pumps 20%: Is This the Start of a Major Rally? Nevertheless, if UNI fails to maintain this strength and breaks below the $8.7 resistance level, it might result in a pullback, with the price sliding back toward the $8.7 support zone. A breakdown below this level could lead to further losses, potentially targeting lower support areas. Such a move would signal weakening optimistic sentiment, raising concerns of a more extended bearish trend and prompting traders to brace for additional downside risks.

42407504,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIaOe,1727865170,Grayscale’s High ETF Fee Keeps the Cash Flowing In Even as Investors Withdraw,"Assets under management at Grayscale's GBTC have slumped 50% due to aggressive outflows since it became an exchange-traded fund.  Even so, Grayscale is making five times the amount BlackRock is from IBIT, CoinDesk calculations show.  That's down to GBTC's expense ratio of 1.50%, compared with IBIT's 0.25%.  Grayscale's bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded fund (ETF) is reaping higher income than its rivals even as investors exit the vehicle for lower-cost options.  The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), with almost $14 billion in assets under management (AUM), is earning about $205 million a year, CoinDesk calculations show. The figure is roughly five times larger than at rival BlackRock iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $17 billion in AUM, which is raking in just $42.5 million.  The discrepancy is mainly down to fees, known as the expense ratio. Before the funds opened for trading on Jan. 11, operators jostling for customers started a price war that saw most settling on an expense ratio below 0.40%. GBTC, which existed as a trust before converting to an ETF, stood out, cutting the ratio just half a percentage point to 1.5%.  At the January launch, that compared with 0.20% at Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), the lowest among the five biggest issuers by assets under management. Ark 21 Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) went to 0.21% while IBIT and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) set it at 0.25%. Grayscale's Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), which started up July 31, now trumps BITB with a 0.15% charge.  Even as investors have withdrawn funds in search of platforms with lower expense ratios, GBTC's head start means the cash is still flowing in. In January, it had AUM of $29 billion, according to YCharts, a financial analysis platform, and roughly 600,000 bitcoin.  The figure's shrunk to $13.65 billion, based on multiplying net assets value (NAV) per share of $49.12 by the 278 million shares outstanding. It now holds about 220,000 bitcoin. IBIT, which holds 366,000 bitcoin, has 642 million shares outstanding and a NAV per share value of $35.13, giving AUM of $17 billion.  BlackRock did not respond to an email requesting comment.

Shareholder dilution remains a major concern, with a 564% increase in shares outstanding over three years, raising questions about long-term benefits. Despite recent underperformance and a breakeven Bitcoin price of $73k in Q2, CleanSpark's ability to raise capital provides financial flexibility. Upgraded to ""buy"" due to potential capitulation and a possible BTC price run, but caution is advised until more corporate performance data is available. It has been over four months since I last covered CleanSpark ( CLSK ) for Seeking Alpha. This is a company that I've written about several times going back to late 2022. I wouldn't say that CleanSpark has become my ""favorite"" public Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stock through the years, but I think it would be fair to say I've generally had a more favorable view of it compared to industry peers, having called it a ""buy"" three times. However, more recently I've been cautious about the stock: CleanSpark: Locked And Loaded For Post-Halving Acquisitions ( ""Hold"" May 2024 ) CleanSpark: Pre-Halving Profit Never Hurts (""Hold"" Feb 2024 ) CleanSpark: Well Positioned For The Future (""Buy"" Dec 2023 ) My caution has come, in part, because of the longer-term economics of Bitcoin mining. But also because shareholders enjoyed enormous returns as 2023 came to a close, and I felt it was getting difficult to justify the share price with a looming halving back in February. My recent CLSK ratings (Seeking Alpha) However, in May I noted the company would be active from an M&A perspective, and we've seen that expectation come to fruition. In this article, we'll look at CleanSpark's recent scaling efforts and assess if CLSK is a buy after what has been a rough selloff since late June. Growth and Mergers At the end of August, CleanSpark reported 22.6 EH/s active and operating. The company still has plans for rather large growth through the end of the year: September Investor Deck (CleanSpark) Since this slide was created, CleanSpark has actually increased guidance up to 37 EH/s by the end of the 2024. Additionally, the company has reaffirmed guidance for 50 EH/s by the end of 2025. To get to that lofty 50 EH/s figure, CleanSpark acknowledges that it has to grow through mergers and acquisitions. To that end, it's been a very busy summer for the company. Site Acquisitions MW Added Location Cost May 9th 75 Wyoming $18.8m, cash June 18th 60 Georgia $25.8m, cash June 27th 400 Tennessee $155m, stock September 11th 85 Tennessee $27.5m, cash September 17th 16.5 Mississippi $5.8m Source: CleanSpark At the end of June, CleanSpark reported $126.1 million in cash on the balance sheet. Thus, I believe it's safe to assume the September acquisitions bring the company's cash balance back below $100 million for the first time since the end of 2023. This is fairly significant due to the all-stock deal in June to acquire GRIID Infrastructure ( GRDI ) for $155 million. GRIID is certainly not a company that we can call financially healthy. I suspect this is why CLSK shares have badly underperformed industry peers since the announcement: Data by YCharts At the time of the announcement, CLSK shares were trading north of $16. As of article submission, those same shares can be had for less than $9. This is not an attempt at playing the 'I told ya so' game, but my caution regarding CLSK has proven to be well-founded. It's one thing to have a hoard of capital for expansion plans, putting that capital to work well can be a bit more challenging. According to the recently released prospectus , the GRIID acquisition brings CleanSpark $3.8 million in cash and less than 2 BTC against $68.5 million in total liabilities. Beyond that, I think it's fair to be curious about how this balance sheet is going to look given what we've seen from deal pricing going back to May: MW Added Location Cost $ per MW 75 Wyoming $18.8 $250,667 60 Georgia $25.8 $430,000 400 Tennessee $155.0 $387,500 85 Tennessee $27.5 $323,529 16.5 Mississippi $5.8 $351,515 Source: CleanSpark, author's calculation Pricing the announced deals in MW, the GRIID acquisition was actually one of the more expensive deals CleanSpark made over the last several months. Each negotiation is obviously different, and we don't know how motivated any individual seller is, but I think it's interesting nonetheless. 'All-In Sustaining Cost' As noted already, CleanSpark is guiding for 37 EH/s by the end of this year. Since we don't yet have expense data from the quarter ended September, Q2-24 may give us an important signal pertaining to CleanSpark's true breakeven price. As I've mentioned in previous articles, this is an estimate for what would be comparable to an 'all-in sustaining cost' figure that Gold mining stock investors generally reference. This is not just the energy cost to mine that Bitcoin mining stock investors like to point to. My figure takes depreciation into consideration. I should note that I'm only including SG&A and depreciation/amortization in the total opex figure below: Q3-23 Q4-23 Q1-24 Q2-24 TTM Cost of Revenues $30,400,000 $93,600,000 $34,300,000 $45,200,000 $203,500,000 Total Opex $83,100,000 $203,900,000 $58,000,000 $70,600,000 $415,600,000 BTC Mined 1,877 2,019 2,031 1,583 7,510 Breakeven Price $60,469 $147,350 $45,446 $73,152 $82,437 Source: Seeking Alpha, CleanSpark, author's calculation I'm not including ""other operating expenses"" of $48.3 million in the quarter from the new FASB accounting rules. That method allows for the re-valuation of BTC that has been previously mined out of quarter as though it is an in-quarter operational outcome. I don't personally care for it. I think the breakeven price in the table above gives us a more fair assessment of the true cost to operate on a quarterly basis. And I specifically want to point out the Q2 figure because it is almost entirely derived from post-halving production performance with the exception of the first three weeks in April. So getting to the point; CleanSpark's breakeven Bitcoin price was $73k in Q2. Dilution As is generally always the case with publicly traded Bitcoin miners, the biggest risk outside of the dwindling supply of minable BTC is the shareholder dilution of the equities. Data by YCharts Here we can see CLSK has been a particularly brutal offender of shareholder dilution with a 564% increase in shares outstanding over just a three-year time period. Raising capital in this way has allowed the company to generally avoid debt, which perhaps gives leadership better optionality for deployment without ongoing interest expenses. This dilution is what has allowed CLSK to scale to the behemoth Bitcoin miner that it already is. What is unclear is if the strategy will benefit shareholders long term. It's an enormous bet on either higher BTC prices or global hashrate coming down . Global Hashrate BTC Hashrate (mempool.space) Since the April halving, global EH/s growth appears exhausted. The moving average for the Bitcoin network was 633 EH/s on the day of the halving. On September 30th, that moving average was down slightly to 627 EH/s. This means that in the time that CleanSpark has scaled from 16.4 EH/s in March to over 26 EH/s in September , the global hashrate hasn't gone much of anywhere. From where I sit, CleanSpark's growing share of global hash post-halving is a bold move and an impressive one if it works out. Summary I'm still not going to say CLSK is a great long-term investment. Shareholder dilution is going to remain an ongoing concern. That said, CleanSpark has been able to grow both production and a sizeable Bitcoin stack in a relatively short amount of time. CleanSpark BTC Stack (CleanSpark, Author's Chart) At a BTC price of $62k, CleanSpark has $468.6 million in capital that can be deployed if the company gets in a pinch financially. However, I don't see that as a significant risk given the company's ability to raise outside capital. I wouldn't personally get too heavy into CLSK until we see another quarter or two of corporate performance data. CLSK Daily (TrendSpider) That being said, I don't hate CLSK as a swing trade. Now that we're in the fourth quarter of 2024, I think we're going to see capitulation in names that have struggled this year - and Bitcoin miners are certainly in that camp with the exception of only a handful of stocks. I don't currently have any CLSK exposure at this time, but if a greater washout under $8 presents itself, I think that could place to take some shots on CLSK if one expects a greater run in the price of BTC to manifest into the end of the year. Despite clear concerns, I'm going to upgrade this one to ""buy"" on possible holder capitulation between now and the end of the year.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724560-cleansparks-summer-buying-spree?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34223578.jpeg

Bitcoin, which had been on a notable price increase earlier, started to face setbacks as September ended, leading up to the first 24 hours of October. The first 24 hours of October have been riddled with outflows from the crypto industry. Bitcoin, in particular, fell below $61,000, according to Coinmarketcap, as tensions started to rise in the Middle East. Going by this decline, it has raised questions as to the outlook for Bitcoin in the rest of the month. Current Bitcoin Price Action The buzz leading into October centered around expectations that Bitcoin would extend its bullish momentum and break through key resistance levels. According to price data, Bitcoin ended the month of September 7.11% above where it started, even peaking above $66,000 at one point. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Could Jump 200% To $0.00006 In October, Here’s Why However, at the time of writing, Bitcoin has fallen by almost 7% from the September peak. Furthermore, Coinmarketcap data shows that Bitcoin has been down by 3.6% in the past 24 hours. The swift downturn has altered the market’s sentiment, with the once-bullish outlook giving way to fear and uncertainty. The Fear and Greed Index, which gauges the market’s emotions and risk appetite, now reads 39 and signals “Fear.” It would seem crypto investors are now panicking, with crypto analyst Kaleo even calling this to attention on social media platform X. After spending five minutes scrolling through the timeline you’d think we’re never going to see a green candle again — K A L E O (@CryptoKaleo) October 1, 2024 Bitcoin’s price action is highly sensitive to events in the world. Notably, the recent decline in the price of Bitcoin can be attributed to geopolitical conflicts in the Middle East. Its recent performance in the face of geopolitical turmoil casts doubts on its role as a safe haven asset. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, which are meant to prop up the Bitcoin spot price, also ended eight consecutive days of inflows with massive outflows on October 1, most likely in reaction to the Middle East tensions. According to Spot Bitcoin ETF flow data from Farside Investors, institutional investors pulled out $246.2 million yesterday. Is Uptober A Myth? The optimistic outlook seems to have faded quickly among many crypto investors. However, many participants are still holding on to the bullish outlook, especially considering the month still has a long way to go before its conclusion. Related Reading: Crypto Researcher Reveals Why XRP Price Reaching $1,000 Is Not A Pipe Dream History shows, more often than not, that October has always been a positive month for Bitcoin. Most importantly, the positive performance was mostly in the second half of the month. Considering the month is only at its beginning, it is more logical to wait and examine how the price action plays out for the rest of the week before drawing any conclusion on Uptober. In the face of these tensions, Bitcoin’s potential role as a safe haven asset similar to gold could rise among market participants in the rest of the month and beyond.

42407509,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZIafB,1727863200,How North Korea Infiltrated the Crypto Industry,"CoinDesk identified more than a dozen crypto companies that unknowingly hired IT workers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), including such well-established blockchain projects as Injective, ZeroLend, Fantom, Sushi, Yearn Finance and Cosmos Hub.  The workers used fake IDs, successfully navigated interviews, passed reference checks and presented genuine work histories.  Hiring DPRK workers is against the law in the U.S. and other countries that sanction North Korea. It also presents a security risk: CoinDesk encountered multiple examples of companies hiring DPRK IT workers and subsequently getting hacked.  ""Everyone is struggling to filter out these people,"" said Zaki Manian, a prominent blockchain developer who says he inadvertently hired two DPRK IT workers to help develop the Cosmos Hub blockchain in 2021.  The crypto company Truflation was still in its early stages in 2023 when founder Stefan Rust unknowingly hired his first North Korean employee.  ""We were always looking for good developers,"" Rust said from his home in Switzerland. Out of the blue, ""this one developer came across the line.""  ""Ryuhei"" sent his resume over Telegram and claimed he was based in Japan. Soon after he was hired, odd inconsistencies began to surface.  At one point, ""I'm talking to the guy, and he said he was in an earthquake,"" Rust recalled. Except there was no recent earthquake in Japan. Then the employee started missing calls, and when he did show up, ""it wasn't him,"" Rust said. ""It was somebody else."" Whoever it was had dropped the Japanese accent.  Rust would soon learn that ""Ryuhei"" and four other employees – more than a third of his entire team – were North Korean. Unwittingly, Rust had fallen prey to a coordinated scheme by North Korea to secure remote overseas jobs for its people and funnel the earnings back to Pyongyang.  U.S. authorities have intensified their warnings recently that North Korean information technology (IT) workers are infiltrating tech companies, including crypto employers, and using the proceeds to fund the pariah state's nuclear weapons program. According to a 2024 United Nations report, these IT workers rake in as much as $600 million annually for Kim Jon Un's regime.  Hiring and paying the workers – even inadvertently – violates U.N. sanctions and is illegal in the U.S. and numerous other countries. It also presents a grave security risk, because North Korean hackers have been known to target companies through covert workers.  A CoinDesk investigation now reveals just how aggressively and frequently North Korean job applicants have targeted crypto companies in particular – successfully navigating interviews, passing reference checks, even presenting impressive histories of code contributions on the open-source software repository GitHub.  CoinDesk spoke to more than a dozen crypto companies that said they inadvertently hired IT workers from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), as the nation is officially called.  These interviews with founders, blockchain researchers and industry experts reveal that North Korean IT workers are far more prevalent in the crypto industry than previously thought. Virtually every hiring manager approached by CoinDesk for this story acknowledged that they had interviewed suspected North Korean developers, hired them unwittingly, or knew someone who had.  ""The percentage of your incoming resumes, or people asking for jobs, or wanting to contribute – any of that stuff – that are probably from North Korea is greater than 50% across the entire crypto industry,"" said Zaki Manian, a prominent blockchain developer who says he inadvertently hired two DPRK IT workers to help develop the Cosmos Hub blockchain in 2021. ""Everyone is struggling to filter out these people.""  Among the unwitting DPRK employers identified by CoinDesk were several well-established blockchain projects, such as Cosmos Hub, Injective, ZeroLend, Fantom, Sushi and Yearn Finance. “This has all been happening behind the scenes,” said Manian.  This investigation marks the first time any of these companies have publicly acknowledged that they inadvertently hired DPRK IT workers.  In many cases, North Korean workers conducted their work just like typical employees; so the employers mostly got what they paid for, in a sense. But CoinDesk found evidence of workers subsequently funneling their wages to blockchain addresses linked to the North Korean government.  CoinDesk's investigation also revealed several instances where crypto projects that employed DPRK IT workers later fell victim to hacks. In some of those cases, CoinDesk was able to link the heists directly to suspected DPRK IT workers on a firm's payroll. Such was the case with Sushi, a prominent decentralized finance protocol that lost $3 million in a 2021 hacking incident.  The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Department of Justice began publicizing North Korean attempts to infiltrate the U.S. crypto industry in 2022. CoinDesk uncovered evidence that DPRK IT workers started working at crypto companies under fake identities well before then, at least as early as 2018.  ""A lot of people, I think, are under the mistaken impression that this is something new that suddenly happened,"" said Manian. ""There are GitHub accounts and other things with these people that, like, go back to 2016, 2017, 2018."" (GitHub, owned by Microsoft, is the online platform that many software organizations use to host code and allow developers to collaborate.)  CoinDesk linked DPRK IT workers to companies using various methods, including blockchain payment records, public GitHub code contributions, emails from U.S. government officials and interviews directly with target companies. One of the largest North Korean payment networks examined by CoinDesk was uncovered by ZachXBT, a blockchain investigator who published a list of suspected DPRK developers in August.  Previously, employers remained silent due to concerns about unwanted publicity or legal repercussions. Now, confronted with extensive payment records and other evidence unearthed by CoinDesk, many of them have decided to come forward and share their stories for the first time, exposing the overwhelming success and scale of North Korea’s efforts to penetrate the crypto industry.  Fake documents  After hiring Ryuhei, the ostensibly Japanese employee, Rust's Truflation received a flood of new applicants. Over just a few months, Rust unwittingly hired four more DPRK developers who said they were based in Montreal, Vancouver, Houston and Singapore.  The crypto sector is especially ripe for sabotage by North Korean IT workers. The workforce is particularly global, and crypto companies tend to be more comfortable than others hiring fully remote – even anonymous – developers.  CoinDesk reviewed DPRK job applications that crypto companies received from a variety of sources, including messaging platforms like Telegram and Discord, crypto-specific job boards like Crypto Jobs List, and hiring sites like Indeed.  ""Where they're having the most luck getting hired is these really fresh, new upstart teams who are willing to hire off a Discord,"" said Taylor Monahan, a product manager at the crypto wallet app MetaMask who frequently publishes security research related to North Korean crypto activity. ""They don't have processes in place to hire people with background checks. They're willing to pay in crypto a lot of times.""  Rust said he had conducted his own background checks on all of Truflation's new hires. ""They sent us their passports and ID cards, gave us GitHub repos, went through a test, and then, basically, we brought them on.""  To the untrained eye, most of the forged documents look indistinguishable from authentic passports and visas, though experts told CoinDesk that they probably would have been caught by professional background-checking services.  Although startups are less likely to use professional background checkers, ""we do see North Korean IT workers at bigger companies as well, either as real employees or at least as contractors,"" said Monahan.  Hiding in plain sight  In many cases, CoinDesk discovered DPRK IT workers at companies using publicly available blockchain data.  In 2021, Manian, the blockchain developer, needed some help at his company, Iqlusion. He sought out freelance coders who might be able to help with a project to upgrade the popular Cosmos Hub blockchain. He found two recruits; they delivered capably.  Manian never met the freelancers, “Jun Kai” and “Sarawut Sanit,” in person. They had previously worked together on an open-source software project funded by THORChain, a closely affiliated blockchain network, and they told Manian they were based in Singapore.  ""I talked to them almost every day for a year,"" said Manian. ""They did the work. And I was, frankly, pretty pleased.""  Two years after the freelancers completed their work, Manian received an email from an FBI agent investigating token transfers that appeared to have come from Iqlusion en route to suspected North Korean crypto wallet addresses. The transfers in question turned out to be Iqlusion's payments to Kai and Sanit.  The FBI never confirmed to Manian that the developers he'd contracted were agents of the DPRK, but CoinDesk's review of Kai and Sanit's blockchain addresses showed that throughout 2021 and 2022, they funneled their earnings to two individuals on OFAC's sanctions list: Kim Sang Man and Sim Hyon Sop.  Acording to OFAC, Sim is a representative for Kwangson Banking Corp, a North Korean bank that launders IT worker funds to help ""finance the DPRK’s WMD and ballistic missile programs."" Sarawut appears to have funneled all of his earnings to Sim and other Sim-linked blockchain wallets.  Kai, meanwhile, funneled nearly $8 million directly to Kim. According to a 2023 OFAC advisory, Kim is a representative for the DPRK-operated Chinyong Information Technology Cooperation Company, which, ""by way of companies under its control and their representatives, employs delegations of DPRK IT workers that operate in Russia and Laos.""  Iqlusion's wages to Kai accounted for less than $50,000 of the nearly $8 million he sent to Kim, and some of the remaining funds came from other crypto companies.  For example, CoinDesk discovered payments from the Fantom Foundation, which develops the widely-used Fantom blockchain, to ""Jun Kai"" and another DPRK-linked developer.  ""Fantom did identify two external personnel as being involved with North Korea in 2021,"" a Fantom Foundation spokesperson told CoinDesk. ""However, the developers in question worked on an external project that was never finished and never deployed.""  According to the Fantom Foundation, ""The two individuals in question were terminated, never contributed any malicious code nor ever had access to Fantom's codebase, and no users of Fantom were impacted."" One of the DPRK workers attempted to attack Fantom's servers but failed because he lacked the requisite access, according to the spokesperson.  According to the OpenSanctions database, Kim's DPRK-linked blockchain addresses were not published by any governments until May 2023 – more than two years after Iqlusion and Fantom made their payments.  Leeway given  The U.S. and the UN sanctioned the hiring of DPRK IT workers in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  It is illegal to pay North Korean workers in the U.S. whether you know you're doing it or not—a legal concept called ""strict liability.""  It doesn't necessarily matter where a company is based, either: Hiring workers from the DPRK can carry legal risks for any company that does business in countries that enforce sanctions against North Korea.  However, the U.S. and other U.N. member states have yet to prosecute a crypto company for hiring North Korean IT workers.  The U.S. Treasury Department opened an inquiry into Iqlusion, which is based in the U.S., but Manian says the investigation concluded without any penalties.  U.S. authorities have been lenient about bringing charges against the firms – on some level acknowledging that they were victims of, at best, an unusually elaborate and sophisticated type of identity fraud, or, at worst, a long con of the most humiliating sort.  Legal risks aside, paying DPRK IT workers is also ""bad because you're paying people that are basically being exploited by the regime,"" explained MetaMask's Monahan.  According to the UN Security Council's 615-page report, DPRK IT workers only keep a small portion of their paychecks. ""Lower earners keep 10 percent while the highest earners could keep 30 percent, "" the report states.  While these wages might still be high relative to the average in North Korea, ""I don't care where they live,"" said Monahan. ""If I am paying someone and they're literally being forced to send their entire paycheck to their boss, that would make me very uncomfortable. It would make me more uncomfortable if their boss is, you know, the North Korean regime.""  CoinDesk reached out to multiple suspected DPRK IT workers over the course of reporting but did not hear back.  Coming forward  CoinDesk identified more than two dozen companies that employed possible DPRK IT workers by analyzing blockchain payment records to OFAC-sanctioned entities. Twelve companies presented with the records confirmed to CoinDesk that they had previously discovered suspected DPRK IT workers on their payrolls.  Some declined to comment further for fear of legal repercussions, but others agreed to share their stories with the hope that others could learn from their experiences.  In many cases, DPRK employees proved easier to identify after they'd been hired.  Eric Chen, CEO of Injective, a decentralized finance-focused project, said that he contracted a freelance developer in 2020 but quickly fired him for underperformance.  ""He didn't last long,"" said Chen. ""He was writing crappy code that didn't work well."" It wasn't until this past year, when a U.S. ""government agency"" reached out to Injective, that Chen learned the employee was linked to North Korea.  Several companies told CoinDesk that they fired an employee before even knowing about any links to the DPRK – say, due to substandard work.  'Milk payroll for a few months'  However, DPRK IT workers are similar to typical developers in that their aptitudes can vary.  On the one hand, you'll have employees who ""show up, get through an interview process, and just milk payroll for a few months of salary,"" said Manian. ""There's also another side of it, which is you encounter these people who, when you interview them, their actual technical chops are really strong.""  Rust recalled having ""one really good developer"" at Truflation who claimed he was from Vancouver but turned out to be from North Korea. ""He was really a young kid,"" Rust said. ""It felt like he was just out of college. A bit green behind the ears, super keen, really excited to be working on an opportunity.""  In another instance, Cluster, a decentralized finance startup, fired two developers in August after ZachXBT reached out with evidence that they were linked to the DPRK.  ""It's actually crazy how much these guys knew,"" Cluster's pseudonymous founder, z3n, told CoinDesk. In retrospect, there were some ""clear red flags."" For example, ""every two weeks they changed their payment address, and every month or so they would change their Discord name or Telegram name.""  Webcam off  In conversations with CoinDesk, many employers said they noticed abnormalities that made more sense when they learned that their employees were probably North Korean.  Sometimes the hints were subtle, like employees working hours that didn't match their supposed work location.  Other employers, like Truflation, noticed hints that an employee was multiple people masquerading as a single individual – something the employee would try to hide by keeping his webcam off. (They're almost always men).  One company hired an employee who showed up for meetings in the morning but would seem to forget everything that was discussed later on in the day – a quirk that made more sense when the employer realized she'd been speaking to multiple people.  When Rust brought his concerns about Ryuhei, his ""Japanese"" employee, to an investor with experience tracking criminal payment networks, the investor quickly identified the four other suspected DPRK IT workers on Truflation's payroll.  ""We immediately cut our ties,"" Rust said, adding that his team conducted a security audit of its code, enhanced its background-checking processes and changed certain policies. One new policy was to require remote workers to turn on their cameras.  A $3M hack  Many of the employers consulted by CoinDesk were under the mistaken impression that DPRK IT workers operate independently from North Korea's hacking arm, but blockchain data and conversations with experts reveal that the regime's hacking activities and IT workers are frequently linked.  In September 2021, MISO, a platform built by Sushi for launching crypto tokens, lost $3 million in a widely reported heist. CoinDesk found evidence that the attack was linked to Sushi’s hiring of two developers with blockchain payment records connected to North Korea.  At the time of the hack, Sushi was one of the most-talked-about platforms in the emerging world of decentralized finance (DeFi). More than $5 billion had been deposited into SushiSwap, which mainly serves as a ""decentralized exchange"" for people to swap between cryptocurrencies without intermediaries.  Joseph Delong, Sushi's chief technology officer at the time, traced the MISO heist to two freelance developers who helped to build it: individuals using the names Anthony Keller and Sava Grujic. Delong said the developers – who he now suspects were a single person or organization – injected malicious code into the MISO platform, redirecting funds to a wallet they controlled.  When Keller and Grujic were contracted by Sushi DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that governs the Sushi protocol, they supplied credentials that seemed typical enough – even impressive – for entry-level developers.  Keller operated under the pseudonym ""eratos1122"" in public, but when he applied to work on MISO he used what appeared to be his real name, ""Anthony Keller."" In a resume that Delong shared with CoinDesk, Keller claimed to reside in Gainesville, Georgia, and to have graduated from the University of Phoenix with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. (The university didn't respond to a request for confirmation of whether there was a graduate by that name.)  Keller's resume included genuine references to previous work. Among the most impressive was Yearn Finance, an extremely popular crypto investment protocol that offers users a way to earn interest across a range of pre-made investment strategies. Banteg, a core developer at Yearn, confirmed that Keller worked on Coordinape, an app built by Yearn to help teams collaborate and facilitate payments. (Banteg says Keller's work was restricted to Coordinape and he didn't have access to Yearn's core codebase.)  Keller referred Grujic to MISO and the two presented themselves as “friends,” according to Delong. Like Keller, Grujic supplied a resume with his supposed real name rather than his online pseudonym, “AristoK3.” He claimed to be from Serbia and a graduate of the University of Belgrade with a bachelor’s degree in computer science. His GitHub account was active, and his resume listed experience with several smaller crypto projects and gaming startups.  Rachel Chu, a former core developer at Sushi who worked closely with Keller and Grujic before the heist, said she was already ""suspicious"" of the pair before any hack had taken place.  Despite claiming to be based across the globe from one another, Grujic and Keller ""had the same accent"" and the ""same way of texting,"" said Chu. ""Every time we talked, they'd have some background noise, like they're in a factory,"" she added. Chu recalled seeing Keller's face but never Grujic's. According to Chu, Keller's camera was ""zoomed in"" so that she couldn't ever make out what was behind him.  Keller and Grujic eventually stopped contributing to MISO around the same time. ""We think that Anthony and Sava are the same guy,"" said Delong, ""so we stop paying them."" This was the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it was not unheard of for remote crypto developers to masquerade as multiple people to extract extra money from payroll.  After Keller and Grujic were let go in the summer of 2021, the Sushi team neglected to revoke their access to the MISO codebase.  On Sept. 2, Grujic committed malicious code to the MISO platform under his ""Aristok3"" screen name, redirecting $3 million to a new cryptocurrency wallet, based on a screenshot provided to CoinDesk.  CoinDesk’s analysis of blockchain payment records suggests a potential link between Keller, Grujic and North Korea. In March 2021, Keller posted a blockchain address in a now-deleted tweet. CoinDesk discovered multiple payments between this address, Grujic's hacker address and the addresses Sushi had on file for Keller. Sushi’s internal investigation ultimately concluded that the address belonged to Keller, according to Delong.  CoinDesk found that the address in question sent most of its funds to ""Jun Kai"" (the Iqlusion developer who sent money to the OFAC-sanctioned Kim Sang Man) and another wallet that appears to serve as a DPRK proxy (because it, too, paid Kim).  Lending further credence to the theory that Keller and Grujic were North Korean, Sushi's internal investigation found that the pair frequently operated using IP addresses in Russia, which is where OFAC says North Korea's DPRK IT workers are sometimes based. (The U.S. phone number on Keller's resume is out of service, and his ""eratos1122"" Github and Twitter accounts have been deleted.)  Additionally, CoinDesk discovered evidence that Sushi employed another suspected DPRK IT contractor at the same time as Keller and Grujic. The developer, identified by ZachXBT as ""Gary Lee,"" coded under the pseudonym LightFury and funneled his earnings to ""Jun Kai"" and another Kim-linked proxy address.  After Sushi publicly pinned the attack on Keller's pseudonym, ""eratos1122,"" and threatened to involve the FBI, Grujic returned the stolen funds. While it might seem counterintuitive that a DPRK IT worker would care about protecting a fake identity, DPRK IT workers seem to reuse certain names and build up their reputations over time by contributing to many projects, perhaps as a way to earn credibility with future employers.  Someone might have decided that protecting the Anthony Keller alias was more lucrative in the long run: In 2023, two years after the Sushi incident, someone named “Anthony Keller” applied to Truflation, Stefan Rust’s company.  Attempts to contact ""Anthony Keller"" and ""Sava Grujic"" for comment were unsuccessful.  DPRK-style heists  North Korea has stolen more than $3 billion in cryptocurrency through hacks over the past seven years, according to the UN. Of the hacks that blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis has tracked in the first half of 2023 and which it believes are connected to the DPRK, “approximately half of them involved IT worker-related theft,” said Madeleine Kennedy, a spokesperson for the firm.  North Korean cyberattacks don't tend to resemble the Hollywood version of hacking, where hoodie-wearing programmers break into mainframes using sophisticated computer code and black-and-green computer terminals.  DPRK-style attacks are decidedly lower-tech. They usually involve some version of social engineering, where the attacker earns the trust of a victim who holds the keys to a system and then extracts those keys directly through something as simple as a malicious email link.  ""To date, we have never seen DPRK do, like, a real exploit,"" said Monahan. ""It's always: social engineering, and then compromise the device, and then compromise the private keys.""  IT workers are well-placed to contribute to DPRK heists, either by extracting personal information that could be used to sabotage a potential target or by gaining direct access to software systems flush with digital cash.  A series of coincidences  On Sept. 25, as this article was nearing publication, CoinDesk was scheduled for a video call with Truflation's Rust. The plan was to fact-check some details he had shared previously.  A flustered Rust joined the call 15 minutes late. He'd just been hacked.  CoinDesk reached out to more than two dozen projects that appeared to have been duped into hiring DPRK IT workers. In the final two weeks of reporting alone, two of those projects were hacked: Truflation and a crypto borrowing app called Delta Prime.  It's too early to determine if either hack was directly connected to any inadvertent hiring of DPRK IT workers.  Delta Prime was breached first, on Sept. 16. CoinDesk had previously uncovered payments and code contributions connecting Delta Prime to Naoki Murano, one of the DPRK-linked developers publicized by ZachXBT, the pseudonymous blockchain sleuth.  The project lost more than $7 million, officially because of ""a compromised private key."" Delta Prime did not respond to numerous requests for comment.  The Truflation hack followed less than two weeks later. Rust noticed funds streaming out of his crypto wallet around two hours before the call with CoinDesk. He had just returned home from a trip to Singapore and was scrambling to make sense of what he'd done wrong. ""I just have no idea how it happened,"" he said. ""I had my notebooks all locked up in the safe in the wall in my hotel. I had my mobile with me the whole time.""  Millions of dollars were leaving Rust's personal blockchain wallets as he was speaking. ""I mean, that really sucks. That's my kids' school; pension fees.""  Truflation and Rust ultimately lost around $5 million. The official cause was a stolen private key.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FTM | REGULATION | YFI,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/02/how-north-korea-infiltrated-the-crypto-industry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e7a7408474c6ddd37a9a0b781cba3d6f099a137d-1955x1222.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin {{BTC}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. saw outflows of $242.6 million on Tuesday in their worst day since Sept. 3, according to data from SoSoValue.  The outflows snapped an eight-day streak of inflows as BTC lost as much as 6% amid an acute sharpening of tensions in the Middle East that saw Iran fire around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday. The strike followed Israel's attacks on Hezbollah, designated a terror group by more than 60 jurisdictions including the U.S., European Union and Arab League, in Lebanon in recent weeks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate.  Bitcoin fell to a low of $60,300, erasing almost all of its gains since the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut last month, signaling an inauspicious start to ""Uptober,"" the community's affectionate name for the calendar month that has historically seen the highest gains for BTC. The largest cryptocurrency has lost 2.6% since the start of the month, CoinDesk Indices data show.  Ether ETFs also suffered on Tuesday with outflows of $48.5 million, the worst day since Sept. 23.

34220481,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645847,1727857855,Dogecoin Price Slides 18% But Whale Activity Suggests Bullish Outlook,"The Dogecoin price experienced a significant drop this week, sliding down more than 20% at times, from a peak of $0.1321 on Saturday to a low of $0.1026 by Tuesday. Despite this decline, on-chain metrics and expert analysis suggest a potentially bullish future for the popular meme coin. Dogecoin Price Remains Bullish On-chain analytics firm Santiment has provided a detailed breakdown of Dogecoin’s activity via X today, indicating robust participation from large-scale holders, known as whales, in the cryptocurrency’s network. “Dogecoin has retraced -18% from its top back on Saturday. But on-chain activity indicates that whales may not be done with all the bullish momentum of crypto’s top meme coin. Though they took profit just before the top, their activity remains very high on DOGE’s network,” Santiment reported. The analytics firm also highlighted a surge in Dogecoin’s network activity, noting that Dogecoin just hit a 7-month high in address activity and 4-month high in whale transactions while retail transactions jumped out on the price dip. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Target $0.20 Soon, Analyst Predicts – Is DOGE Primed For A Rally? Over the last three days, 63,689 DOGE addresses have transferred coins which marks the largest stretch since April 2-4. Moreover, 1,203 whale transactions (>$100,000) preceded the local Dogecoin price top on September 28th. This marks the highest whale activity since May 26-28. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted the massive activity within the network via X. Martinez stated: “The Dogecoin network is experiencing significant growth! Over the past week, there’s been a 72% increase in new DOGE addresses, and just yesterday alone, 19,630 new DOGE addresses were created!” The crypto analyst further bolsters the bullish sentiment surrounding Dogecoin with a technical analysis. Martinez points out that DOGE might be nearing a MACD bullish crossover on the weekly chart, a potential indicator of upcoming price increases. “The last two times Dogecoin DOGE had a MACD bullish crossover on the weekly chart, it rallied 90% and 180%, respectively. A new MACD bullish crossover could be forming soon!” he explained. The MACD, or Moving Average Convergence Divergence, is a crucial tool in technical analysis. It consists of two lines: the MACD line, which is the difference between the 26-period and 12-period exponential moving averages (EMAs), and the signal line, which is the 9-period EMA of the MACD line. A bullish crossover, where the MACD line crosses above the signal line, typically signals a shift from a bearish to a bullish market trend, often interpreted as a buy signal.

Tokenized gold allowed the precious metal to be used more freely as collateral without traditional limitations like storage, a World Gold Council executive noted.  Real-world asset tokenization company Digital Asset said Tuesday that it completed a pilot initiative to tokenize U.K. bonds (gilts), Eurobonds, and gold for financial transactions using the Canton Network protocol.  Major securities settlement provider Euroclear, the World Gold Council and global law firm Clifford Chance also participated in the process, alongside with other banks, investors, custodians and a central securities depository, the press release said.  Tokenization refers to the process of converting real-world assets (RWA) such as bonds, real estate, or commodities like gold into digital tokens on blockchain rails. These tokens represent ownership or control over the asset, allowing it to be traded more easily and quickly in a digital format, while still preserving the value of the underlying property. Reports by Boston Consulting Group and 21Shares forecast over $10 trillion of tokenized assets by the end of the decade in their optimistic scenarios, while McKinsey predicted $2 trillion by then in its base case.  Read more: Banking Giants Abuzz About Tokenization of Real-World Assets as DeFi Craves Collateral  In the case of this pilot, which ran between June and July, the project created digital representations of gilts, Eurobonds, and gold to be used as collateral with greater transparency, faster transfers and around-the-clock, near-instantaneous settlements between parties, without the delays associated with traditional financial rails.  ""Our work with the pilot participants has demonstrated that tokenized assets can be used with immediate effect to meet intraday margin calls outside of normal settlement cycles, processing times, and time zones,"" said Kelly Mathieson, chief business development officer at Digital Asset. It also demonstrated how the ledger can serve as the legal record and has validated the secured party’s control over the digital twin and real-world assets received as margin or collateral in the event of a counterparty default.”  Tokenized gold also offered notable benefits, said Mike Oswin, global head of market structure and innovation at the World Gold Council. By converting physical gold into ""Standard Gold Units” (SGU), the pilot demonstrated how the precious metal can be used more seamlessly as collateral asset in financial transactions.  “This removes traditional barriers like storage limitations,” said Mike Oswin, global head of market structure and innovation at The World Gold Council.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/10/02/tokenization-allows-more-efficient-collateral-transfers-digital-asset-euroclear-and-world-gold-council-found-in-pilot-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e83ed3c77b09119b6f00c9fcc99749721c317d58-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34218850,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24246,1727853883,Bitfinex Alpha | Liệu Tháng 10 Có Phải Là “Uptober”?,"Tải Full alpha Bitcoin đã tăng vọt 26,2% kể từ mức đáy 52.756 đô vào hôm 6/9, vượt qua mốc 65.000 đô và “đá bay” đỉnh cũ ngày 25/8. Động thái tăng này đánh dấu lần đầu tiên Bitcoin phá vỡ đỉnh cục bộ kể từ tháng 3/2024. Điều này lại trùng hợp với tín hiệu tháng 10, tháng mà lịch sử ghi nhận là tháng “ăn nên làm ra” nhất của Bitcoin với mức tăng trung bình 27,7%. Tin vui này cùng với quý 4 sắp tới – quý thường mang lại lợi nhuận “khủng” hàng năm, đã củng cố sự lạc quan cho các nhà đầu tư về những đợt tăng giá tiếp theo. Tuy nhiên, dù Bitcoin đã “giật” lại các mức on-chain quan trọng như Giá Hiện thực Hóa của Người nắm giữ Ngắn hạn (hiện tại là 62.750 đô), vẫn có “ biển báo nguy hiểm “. Việc mua trên thị trường giao ngay, vốn rầm rộ từ đáy 6/9, giờ đã hạ nhiệt , cho thấy thị trường có thể đang nghỉ lấy sức. Khối lượng mở (OI) của BTC bùng nổ khi vượt 35 tỷ đô, mức mà thường đi kèm với đỉnh giá trước đây. Điều này khiến nhiều người lo ngại thị trường đang quá nóng. Tuy nhiên, một cú giảm nhẹ 5-10% có thể hạ nhiệt OI mà không ảnh hưởng đến xu hướng tăng chung. Bitcoin vẫn đang trong vùng 50.000 – 68.000 đô giống như năm 2020. Nếu lịch sử lặp lại , Bitcoin có thể chạm đỉnh mới vào cuối quý 4/2024 hoặc đầu 2025, nhờ lượng Bitcoin lưu trữ trên các sàn giao dịch giảm và áp lực bán ra ít đi. Tình hình kinh tế Mỹ tháng 8 và đầu tháng 9 thì “lúc nắng lúc mưa”. Lạm phát đã hạ nhiệt , ghi nhận mức tăng hàng năm nhỏ nhất trong hơn ba năm rưỡi, cho thấy kinh tế đang ổn định dần. Tăng trưởng kinh tế thì vù vù với GDP quý 2/2024 tăng 3% hàng năm . Tuy nhiên, niềm tin của người tiêu dùng – được ghi nhận trước khi Fed công bố cắt giảm lãi suất trong tháng này – đã giảm mạnh trong tháng 9, đánh dấu mức giảm đáng kể nhất trong ba năm, phần lớn do lo ngại về thị trường lao động. Dù vậy, số hộ gia đình có kế hoạch mua nhà trong sáu tháng tới lại tăng bất ngờ, cho thấy dấu hiệu tiềm năng về khả năng phục hồi kinh tế ngày càng lạc quan. Thế giới tiền điện tử thì vẫn sôi động. Các doanh nghiệp Mỹ hiện có thể mua, bán, nắm giữ và chuyển tiền điện tử, nhưng nhiều người vẫn “lăn tăn” về bản chất phi lưu ký của các mô hình này, và cho rằng các nền tảng như PayPal quá tập trung, đi ngược lại với tinh thần phi tập trung của tiền điện tử. Trong khi đó, Phó Tổng thống Kamala Harris đã cam kết tăng cường vai trò lãnh đạo của Mỹ trong các công nghệ mới nổi, bao gồm blockchain và tiền điện tử, như một phần trong tầm nhìn của bà về “nền kinh tế cơ hội” nhằm tăng cường khả năng cạnh tranh toàn cầu của quốc gia trong kỷ nguyên kỹ thuật số. Về phía các doanh nghiệp, Ethena sẽ ra mắt stablecoin mới , UStb, được hỗ trợ bởi Quỹ Thanh khoản Kỹ thuật số Thể chế USD của BlackRock hợp tác với Securitize. Stablecoin này cung cấp một giải pháp thay thế ổn định hơn cho stablecoin USDe hiện có của họ và có thể được sử dụng làm tài sản thế chấp ký quỹ trên các sàn giao dịch, phục vụ cho nhóm nhà đầu tư có khẩu vị rủi ro khác. Nói chung, thị trường đang “rộn ràng” với những thay đổi, hứa hẹn một tương lai thú vị cho tiền điện tử. Chúc bạn một tuần giao dịch tuyệt vời cùng Bitfinex Alpha 124!

34218182,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645792,1727852449,Bonk ‘In Prime Position For Turbo Green Week’ As Price Recovers Key Level,"Bonk continues its bullish rally as ‘Uptober’ begins, sparking a bullish sentiment among investors after the recent fear of a major pullback. The memecoin sensation kickstarted its Q4 journey positively, reclaiming crucial levels, with investors and crypto analysts forecasting a green weekly close. Related Reading: SUI Sees 15% Weekly Surge Ahead Of Token Unlock, Can It Hit New ATH In October? BONK Closes Q3 With 13% Surge Bonk has seen a remarkable performance throughout the past two weeks, jumping 60% since September 15. The memecoin broke above the multi-month downtrend line after successfully reclaiming the $0.000022 resistance level last Friday, registering a 38% surge in the past week. Additionally, the dog-themed sensation closed the month 48% above its opening price, revisiting levels before August’s Black Monday. The token also saw a 13% increase from its Q3 opening, trading around $0.000025 as October started. This bullish price action propelled BONK’s price above $0.000026 momentarily before retracing back the $0.000024 support level, which some considered an extremely bullish signal for the token’s future price action. According to crypto trader Astekz, BONK’s monthly reclaim meant that “any consolidation” above the breakout level is “giga bullish.” Moreover, the token had a 13% increase in daily market activity in the past day, registering a daily trading volume of $795.3 million. Is A ‘Turbo Green Week’ In The Making? Crypto analyst Bluntz noted that, alongside all the strong memecoins, BONK had a “swift” recovery from the weekly dip following a “perfect abc pullback.” This performance put the memecoin “in prime position for a turbo green week,” which he further predicted after its Monday performance. To Bluntz, BONK is close to a breakout after spending three days of sideway moves. Additionally, the token reclaimed the 200-day Moving Average (DMA), which had been sitting above it for the past day. The trader considered that the token’s next parabolic run could be “sustained” and target the $0.000035 resistance level soon. Other market watchers echoed this sentiment, highlighting BONK’s strength throughout the recent dips. Another analyst noted that the memecoin has moved within a large symmetrical triangle since its March all-time high (ATH). The trader detailed that the token’s price is moving closer to the pattern’s resistance since forming a triple bottom at $0.000016. A breakout from the multi-month pattern could send the token’s price to a potential 70% rally toward the previous ATH of $0.000045. Additionally, some investors believe that the cryptocurrency could be positively affected by the market’s general performance this “Uptober.” Related Reading: WIF Bulls In Control As RSI Signals Strong Upside Potential Last October, the cryptocurrency started a massive rally that shredded two zeros from the token’s price, closing Q3 2023 at $0.00014, a 6,900% surge.

Data from CoinGlass shows that 86% of traders are bullish going into October.  Futures tied to major tokens saw over $450 million in long liquidations in the past 24 hours as a bitcoin {{BTC}} plunge led to losses among major tokens, with some falling as much as 8%.  CoinGlass data shows that bitcoin traders betting on higher prices lost over $122 million, while bets on ether {{ETH}} lost nearly $100 million. Smaller alternative tokens (altcoins) recorded over $85 million in liquidations -- the highest such figures since July -- with memecoin pepe (PEPE) an unusually high $10 million in liquidations.  A liquidation occurs when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to the trader's inability to meet the margin requirements. Large-scale liquidations can indicate market extremes, like panic selling or buying. A cascade of liquidations might suggest a market turning point, where a price reversal could be imminent due to an overreaction in market sentiment.  Global equities and risk assets such as bitcoin took a hit Tuesday as Iran launched missiles on key Israeli locations, with the latter threatening retaliation in the coming days. BTC slid to as low as $60,300 in its worst start to a historically bullish month late Tuesday, before recovering above $61,500 in Asian trading hours Wednesday.  The drop caused pain for futures traders, who took on their biggest losses since early August.  The data shows that nearly 86% of all futures bets were bullish. Traders were positioning for higher prices in the weeks ahead as October traditionally favors BTC, with only two negative months since 2013.

34215814,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645778,1727847054,XRP Open Interest Climbs To $1 Billion: What’s Driving Interest In The Token?,"Ripple’s XRP token amassed close to $1 billion in open interest over the weekend, while its price hovers around $0.61 at press time, data from CoinGlass shows. What’s Different About XRP Price Action? While the top two cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), have been down 1.5% and 2.3% over the past week, XRP has been up 4.1% during the same period. Several factors could explain XRP’s counter-trend price action. For example, digital asset manager Grayscale Investments recently launched a closed-end XRP Trust in the US, enabling institutional investors to gain exposure to one of the top ten cryptocurrencies by reported market cap. Related Reading: Grayscale Unveils First XRP Trust In The US, ETF Ahead? Grayscale’s Trust surged by more than 11% within a week, hinting at strong institutional demand for the seventh largest crypto-asset. The launch of the Trust has also fuelled speculations about the potential approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) shortly. If the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves an XRP-based ETF, it would become only the third digital asset with its own ETF. Another key development in the Ripple ecosystem is the anticipated launch of its USD-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. Currently, crypto analysts on X are closely watching the stablecoin in private beta testing on both the XRP and Ethereum networks. According to a recent update, 480,000 RLUSD was minted at RLUSD Treasury, signaling active development of the stablecoin before its integration into Ripple’s services, including its cross-border payment products. The stablecoin can also be used in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols across blockchains. Implications Of Rising Open Interest Data from CoinGlass indicates that open interest in XRP surged to more $1 billion over the weekend before it tumbled to roughly $945 billion at press time. Spot trading volume in the last 24 hours stands slightly above $2 billion. A rise in open interest typically indicates increased market activity, suggesting that more contracts are being opened. This may signal expectations of a price move in either direction, depending on the prevailing market sentiment. Notably, XRP’s open interest was last recorded around the $1 billion mark in March 2024. As for price action, crypto analysts have divided opinions on XRP. Ripple Labs’ recent legal victory over the SEC provided optimism for the altcoin bulls, with one analyst predicting that if the token overcomes key resistance levels, it could surge to between $16 and $20. Related Reading: XRP To $1,000? Experts Weigh In On Bold Predictions And Market Realities Meanwhile, another crypto analyst, Carl Runfelt, highlighted a multi-year bullish triangle pattern on the token’s chart. He noted that if XRP breaks the pattern and goes parabolic, it could rise by more than 200% within weeks. On the contrary, XRP’s inability to break through the $0.60 resistance level decisively could lead the token to retest the $0.55 support level. XRP trades at $0.61 at press time, down 1.6% in the past 24 hours.

DOGE is now stable above $0.100 and attempting a rebound. DOGE price started another decline below the $0.1150 and $0.1120 levels. The price is trading below the $0.1120 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1175 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.1120 and $0.1175 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Trims Gains Dogecoin price failed to continue to higher above the $0.1320 resistance zone. DOGE formed a high at $0.1320 and started a downward move like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a move below the $0.1200 and $0.1150 levels. The price even dipped below the $0.1120 support. A low was formed at $0.1025 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.1060 level. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1150 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.1095 level. It is close to the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1320 swing high to the $0.1025 low. The next major resistance is near the $0.1120 level. A close above the $0.1120 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1175 resistance. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1175 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1320 swing high to the $0.1025 low. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1200 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1320. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1095 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1060 level. The next major support is near the $0.1050 level. The main support sits at $0.100. If there is a downside break below the $0.100 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.0950 level or even $0.0880 in the near term.

42390257,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvFDz,1727845421,Bitcoin Regains $61K in Worst Start to Most Bullish Month as Israel-Iran Tensions Rage On,"Tensions in the Middle East pushed down BTC during the first half of Asia trading hours Wednesday.  The CoinDesk 20, a measure of the most liquid digital assets, had its worst drop in weeks.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} rose above $61,500 in Asian morning hours Wednesday after sliding to as low as $60,300 late Tuesday as a Middle East conflict grows, denting hopes for a rally in the asset’s historically most bullish month.  Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, threatening a fresh round of attacks as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate. The strike was in response to Israel first carrying out a series of attacks on Lebanon in the past weeks.  BTC fell the most in over a month, while gold rose, with the drop reaching 6% at one point and 24-hour losses at 3.5%. That was the worst start for the asset’s historically most bullish month, Presto Research traders wrote in a note Wednesday.  Polymarket bettors are giving a 49% chance that Israel will retaliate against Iran by the end of the week.  “Historically, October has been a strong month for BTC with only two losing years out of the last 11,” Presto said. It pointed out gold’s outperformance in the past 24 hours as a measure of the different maturity levels of both assets.  “Last night’s BTC price action (BTC -4% vs. gold +0.8%) in the aftermath of Iran’s attack in May puzzling, esp. considering BlackRock’s recent pitch for BTC as a risk-off asset similar to gold,” researchers led by Peter Chung wrote. “The reality is that the difference in these two assets’ short-term price actions reflects their different maturity phases.”  The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) fell 4.7%, its worst drop in recent weeks.  “Gold is a much more mature asset, with a 5,000 year history as a store of value, so there’s not much room left for incremental network effects. BTC, on the other hand, shares the same attributes that make gold a good store of value (better in many cases), but with only 15 15-year history. This means it’s in the early stages of mainstream adoption, and its narrative is still poorly understood,” they added.  Dogecoin (DOGE) led losses among major tokens with an 8% haircut over the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows, with XRP (XRP), Solana’s SOL, BNB Chain’s BNB and ether (ETH) losing as much as 6%.  Smaller tokens with a market cap under $2 billion fared worst, with Sei Network’s SEI, memecoin floki (FLOKI) and Starknet’s STARK falling as much as 16%.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH | SEI,BTC | ETH | FIAT | TRADING | SEI,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/02/bitcoin-regains-61k-in-worst-start-to-most-bullish-month-as-israel-iran-tensions-rage-on,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8142dec16a595aba3e6c3f1bb742b14314bedc43-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34213439,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645626,1727841657,Shiba Inu Leads Whale Frenzy: Large SHIB Transfers See Massive 360% Spike,"On-chain data shows Shiba Inu is among the altcoins that have enjoyed a sharp uptick in interest from the whales over the past week. Shiba Inu Whale Transaction Count Has Just Seen A Massive Surge In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has discussed about the trend in the Whale Transaction Count for various top altcoins. The “Whale Transaction Count” here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the total amount of transfers happening on a given network that are carrying a value of at least $100,000. Related Reading: Bitcoin Hype Bites Back As BTC Crashes Under $64,000 Transactions of this scale are typically associated with the whale entities, so this indicator’s value tells us about what the activity from these large investors is like at the moment. When the value of this metric is high, it means the network is handling a high number of large transactions right now. Such a trend implies the whales have an active interest in trading the coin. On the other hand, the indicator being low implies the whales may not be paying much attention to the cryptocurrency as they are not making too many transfers. Now, here is a table that shows the ranking of the digital assets with at least a $2 billion market cap based on the latest weekly change in their Whale Transaction Count: As is visible above, Injective (INJ), Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) on the Optimism blockchain, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have been the top three coins in terms of this metric over the past week. Compared to one week ago, the indicator is up 455% for INJ, 420% for WBTC, and 360% for SHIB. These values are all clearly very significant, suggesting that the whales have shown a huge burst of activity on these networks. The rest of the coins on this list have also enjoyed a notable increase in whale activity during this window, but there is a large gap between them and the top three. While Shiba Inu isn’t number one, its surge in the Whale Transaction Count may still be the most impressive, considering that a coin like Injective is much smaller in market cap. Large coins generally already have significant whale activity, so room for percentage growth tends to be relatively small, which may be why some of the popular names are absent from the list. The other two major memecoins, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE), are also present on this list, but Shiba Inu has left them in the dust as they have only witnessed Whale Transaction growths of 109% and 66%. Related Reading: XRP Surges 10% As Whales Participate In $300 Million Buying Spree Generally, it’s hard to say anything about whether the indicator being high is bullish or bearish for an asset, since it only tells us about the total number of whale transfers and nothing about the split between buy and sell moves. That said, the Whale Transaction Count being high does usually correspond to higher volatility. In Shiba Inu’s case, the coin’s price has surged recently, implying that the burst of whale activity may have been tending towards buying so far. SHIB Price At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading around $0.0000180, up more than 23% over the past week.

The VC secured over $1.20 million in profits, assuming they sold all these tokens at spot rates. Of all these tokens, their AAVE holdings has seen them gain over $1.1 million in profits. However, at spot rates, they are in red from their COMP holdings. COMP is the native governance token of Compound, a lending protocol. Fenbushi received these tokens nearly two years ago, in 2022, months after most of them had soared to record highs in the last DeFi and NFT-driven bull run. When writing, no statement from Fenbushi explained their decision to transfer most of these DeFi tokens to the exchange. DeFi Rising And Protocols Building: Wrong Timing To Exit? Whenever coins are moved to a centralized exchange could signal weakness and be seen as bearish. However, considering the current crypto sentiment, Fenbushi’s raises eyebrows and could slow down the uptrend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Could Skyrocket To $118,000 By Year-End: Here’s Why According to DeFiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) across DeFi protocols is over $88 billion. At spot rates, TVL is up by over 100% from 2022 lows of around $36 billion. Out of this, Aave, Uniswap, and Compound are some of the largest platforms. Aave manages over $12.7 billion of assets, while Uniswap controls over $4.8 billion. Beyond the sharp uptick in total DeFi TVL, these protocols are also actively building. Uniswap, the decentralized exchange, plans to release its v4 in the coming months, while Aave actively attracts new users. By late September, the lending app had received close to $20 billion in user deposits, cementing its position in DeFi.

42390280,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bbvGNn,1727832600,The Spectre of Sam Bankman-Fried Overshadowed Caroline Ellison's Sentencing,"Caroline Ellison, flanked by her attorneys, was sentenced to two years in prison and three years of supervised release for her role in propping up FTX and Alameda Research last week.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  24 months  Caroline Ellison was not the main character at her own sentencing hearing.  When a federal prosecutor and a defense attorney took the stand to discuss Caroline Ellison's conduct before and after the collapse of FTX, her former boss – and yes, former boyfriend – Sam Bankman-Fried took center stage.  Bankman-Fried was convicted a year ago and sentenced more than six months ago. Neither he nor any of his representatives had a role in Ellison's hearing last Tuesday. And yet, much of Ellison's actions were presented through the frame of Bankman-Fried's conduct.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, the prosecutor who toyed with Bankman-Fried during his cross-examination last year, leading to some indelibly awkward interactions, contrasted Ellison with the FTX founder on Tuesday.  Bankman-Fried showed no remorse, while Ellison did. Bankman-Fried posed a threat, while Ellison was not a recidivism risk. Bankman-Fried masterminded FTX's sketchy actions, while Ellison merely carried out her former boss's bidding, Sassoon stressed in her opening statement.  ""Your Honor had the opportunity to observe Ms. Ellison's demeanor when she testified on the stand,"" she said. ""She was the same person who came to proffer with [the DOJ in 2022 and 2023] … just from a standpoint of demeanor, this was a sharp contrast with Bankman-Fried.""  Anjan Sahni, the Wilmer Hale partner representing Ellison on the stand, spoke a bit more about Ellison as a person, but still contrasted her with Bankman-Fried. Her role at Alameda was due to Bankman-Fried, her concealing Alameda's financial situation was at the request of Bankman-Fried, indeed the central question of how Ellison came to a sentencing hearing having pled guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges came down to ""why did Caroline go along with Sam Bankman-Fried,"" he said.  The true tragedy, Sahni said, was “how rapidly and needlessly the trajectory of Miss Ellison unraveled,” when she came into contact with Bankman-Fried.  ""Over time, her whole professional and personal life revolved around Bankman-Fried,"" he said. Ellison’s primary concern was being “good enough” for the one-time golden boy of crypto. When he expressed romantic interest in Ellison, it was “genuinely thrilling” for her.  She had the opportunity to walk away at several points, her lawyer told the court, but she didn’t. “She could not bring herself to leave Bankman-Fried’s orbit…in hindsight, she sees it was crazy to stay.”  Ellison blinked rapidly throughout the hearing, frequently wringing her hands and wrapping her arms around herself as she listened to her attorney speak, cried as she spoke to the judge.  “At each stage of the process, it became harder and harder to extricate myself,” the 29-year-old said, her voice wavering. “I’m sorry I wasn’t brave.”  Even Judge Lewis Kaplan referenced Bankman-Fried as he read out his sentence, saying the FTX founder had Ellison's ""kryptonite"" and noting that the guidelines recommendation for the two were identical.  Ellison cooperated, while Bankman-Fried ""denied the whole thing,"" he said.  “While you were greatly culpable in this fraud, no doubt about it, that remarkable cooperation…is a fundamental distinction between you and Mr. Bankman-Fried,” Kaplan said.  The judge seemed sympathetic to Ellison, and praised her extensive cooperation with prosecutors.  ""You’re a very strong person in some ways, Miss Ellison. You were vulnerable and you were exploited,"" Kaplan said. ""You are genuinely remorseful … your testimony was honest. Mr. Bankman-Fried, as I said at his sentencing, perjured himself. There's no way you're ever going to do something like this again, I am persuaded.""  But her remorse, it seems, wasn’t enough to spare Ellison a custodial sentence.  “In a case this serious, to be literally a get-out-of-jail-free-card is not something I can see my way through to,” Kaplan said.  Ellison was sentenced to 24 months in prison, and will serve at least 1.5 years before being eligible for parole.

34208762,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645767,1727830856,Is Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Reversal? Here’s What This Key Indicator Suggests,"Recently, a CryptoQuant analyst using the pseudonym “datascope” provided insight into the relationship between Bitcoin price and the Long/Short Volume to Open Interest Ratio. According to the analyst, this ratio is a key metric for understanding market behavior and investor sentiment, making it a valuable tool for predicting potential price trends. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up For A Bigger Rally? Here’s What On-Chain Data Reveals The Long/Short Ratio And Its Role In Market Sentiment As investor sentiment shifts between optimism and pessimism, the Long/Short ratio measures the balance of the market’s long (buy) and short (sell) positions. The dynamic ratio indicates the prevailing sentiment—whether the market expects the price to increase or decrease. Understanding these signals is crucial as it can hint at potential price movements and market turning points. To further understand the concept behind this indicator, the CryptoQuant analyst elaborated, noting: The Long/Short ratio indicates the distribution of long and short positions held by investors. A high Long ratio means that investors generally expect a price rise, indicating positive sentiment, while a high Short ratio suggests expectations of a price decline. Analyzing Bitcoin’s historical data, datascope pointed out how the ratio correlates with price changes. The chart provided in the analysis showed Bitcoin’s price trajectory, represented by a white line, along with the Long/Short ratio indicated by green and red lines. The analyst used Red and green boxes to highlight periods of extremely long or short positions, providing a visual representation of when market sentiment reached heightened levels of either optimism or fear. These extreme positions often serve as indicators for potential price reversals. For instance, when the ratio shows excessive long positions (highlighted in red boxes), it may signal that market optimism is too high, often leading to corrections as overly confident investors trigger a sell-off. On the other hand, a rise in short positions (highlighted in green boxes) may suggest that fear and pessimism have peaked, often marking a turning point for a price recovery. Current Bitcoin Market Shifts Using The Long/Short Ratio According to the chart shared by Datascope, so far, Bitcoin’s long positions now appear to be excessive, thereby signaling a potential reversal to the downside. However, datascope mentioned that it is essential to approach this ratio with caution. The analyst emphasized that although the Long/Short ratio is a powerful tool for understanding market sentiment, it should not be relied upon in isolation. The CryptoQuant analyst concluded: Investors should use market sentiment alongside other technical indicators for more reliable signals, as relying solely on this ratio can be misleading.
