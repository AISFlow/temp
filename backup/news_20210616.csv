42387143,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWl2L,1623886481,"Institutional Investors Come to Polygon Amid Rising Ethereum Layer-2 Demand, Blockchain Data Shows","Retail investors and traders are not alone among the decentralized finance (DeFi) users flocking to Polygon, which is a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks, known as a ""layer 2"" network. An increasing number of institutions and large investors are also joining the Polygon throng, according to blockchain data.      At the beginning of June, about 65% of daily stablecoin transaction volume on Polygon came from transactions with values above $1 million, according to data compiled by blockchain data research firm Nansen. That percentage underscores the shift of DeFi “whales” from Ethereum to Polygon.      “Most addresses classified as institutions and funds that we’ve found aren’t yet on Polygon, but the number is growing day by day,” Ling Young Loon, a research analyst at Nansen, told CoinDesk in an email response.      Ling said that institutions’ growing interest in Polygon could have come after the liquidity in the protocol started growing much higher compared with its initial capital base.      Many Ethereum-native DeFi protocols have moved or started migrating to Polygon, including the popular money market protocol Aave. Most recently, Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Kyber Network announced that it will integrate Polygon with the launch of “Rainmaker,” a new market maker protocol by Kyber.      Read More: Kyber Network Announces Polygon Integration and Liquidity Mining Program      The cheaper yield farming and high frequency trading opportunities are also driving institutions to Polygon, said Mira Christanto, an analyst at crypto data firm Messari.      “Even if Ethereum fees are not that prohibitive for [whales] for infrequent trades, they can do high frequency trades on Polygon, which is still prohibitively expensive on Ethereum,” Christanto said.      At press time, there was more than $12 billion worth of funds locked in Aave’s Polygon deployment combined with Aave V2, according to Aave’s website. The DeFi protocol announced its migration to Polygon at the end of March.      “I have been using Polygon almost 100% in the last three months,” John Lilic, a ConsenSys alum and crypto investor, said. “We can also see a tremendous growth for Aave on Polygon, for example, so it's clear that there are big whales migrating.”      Lilic, who is on Polygon’s advisory board, said that institutions are starting to favor Polygon not just for its cheap cost and fast transaction speed, noting that data has shown Polygon's rapid growth and has continued even as gas fees on Ethereum have dropped.      Previously, some analysts said that Polygon’s success may be short-lived once Ethereum 2.0 rolls out. But Lilic questioned whether the much anticipated upgrade on Ethereum blockchain would launch successfully.      “How confident are you that Ethereum 2.0 will actually ship?” Lilic asked. “Vitalik [Buterin] and other Ethereum researchers are my heroes and I really admire their work so much but the market needs to be more rational and calm down the hype.”      Christine Kim, research associate at CoinDesk, said in an interview that skepticism around Ethereum’s forthcoming transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) is “valid” given that historically, there were several delays to the upgrade. But the over $14 billion worth of ether locked to the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain in the past six months shows strong confidence in Ethereum’s future to become a PoS blockchain.      At the same time, Ling added that it is possible that the migration of users, especially large-valued players, from Ethereum to Polygon has also helped lower Ethereum gas fees in recent weeks.      Between June 1 and 7 alone, stablecoin transactions valued more than $1 million dominated Polygon, data provided by Nansen shows.      As gas fees on Ethereum continue to decrease, “some users and funds might want to stay on Ethereum because of various reasons: decentralization, access to innovative protocols etc.,” Ling said. “Some might be willing to sacrifice on that for cheaper gas costs. People can decide for themselves.”      Kim said that despite the confidence of Eth 2.0, the scalability improvements that are expected along with the network upgrade may not come “as fast or be as effective” to meet the growing need from the increased Ethereum users.      “As such, layer-2 scaling solutions such as Polygon have an important role to play on Ethereum both now and in the future,” she added.      UPDATE (June 17, 2021, 01:11 UTC): There are more than $14 billion worth of ether locked to the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain in the past six months, not previously stated $14 million.

42387111,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWiQ3,1623880162,2 Ethereum Projects Are Officially Merging; 'Keanu' Aims for August Launch,"Two well-regarded protocols born out of the 2017-2018 initial coin offering era are officially merging. Simply put, Codename: KEANU is a go.      The two projects, Keep and NuCypher, realized they faced inevitable competition that would lead to wasted energy. In what might be called a true spirit of decentralized entrepreneurship, the two decentralized encryption communities decided to combine their underlying protocols so their respective startups could proceed with separate business plans using common blockchain infrastructure.      It's as if the Hershey and Mars candy corporations merged their factories but kept their brands in independent companies.      ""The Keep and NuCypher networks have built similar technology with similar goals. Rather than splitting the market, we think we can achieve more together,"" Matt Luongo, the CEO of Thesis, the company that built Keep, wrote via a spokesperson.      The merger, nicknamed Keanu in homage to the star of “The Matrix,” would mark an historic moment for the blockchain industry. As new projects started using tokens as gateways and governance tools, many observers expected mergers would be inevitable, but no one knew exactly what form they would take.      Keanu is the first sign of how it might happen, making use of the crypto-native organizational structure known as a distributed autonomous organization (DAO). At least to outside observers, the joining of forces seems to have been notably collegial.      ""The approval of the Keanu proposal is an exciting moment for both the NuCypher and Keep communities and a big milestone for the entire crypto space: the first-ever merge of two decentralized networks,” MacLane Wilkison, NuCypher's CEO, said by email. “This pushes the envelope in terms of what is possible with DAO and community-led governance and opens the door to increasingly sophisticated DAO to DAO interactions going forward.""      Known internally as Release Candidate 0 (RC0), the proposed combination passed both communities on June 11.      ""There were several rounds of community proposals that were discussed before landing on this as the potential final proposal,"" Wilkison wrote via email while the discussions were still underway.      According to a blog post from NuCypher, the proposal would create a token called T, 10% of which will be set aside for the DAO. The rest would go half to NyCypher's token holders and half to Keep's.      The new platform is estimated to go live in August.      ""Our shared community has spoken – and while both dev teams will remain independent, we’ll all be focused on growing a single protocol,"" Luongo wrote. ""A merged network means more useful services and more fees for stakers.""      One of the first products built on the new protocol would be tBTC v2, a more capital-efficient version of the censorship-resistant wrapped bitcoin from Keep for Ethereum.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | TOKEN SALE,Brady Dale,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/16/2-ethereum-projects-are-officially-merging-keanu-aims-for-august-launch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bd01544e5ffcd56aba36f2d45ba489ea2c9c65a1-1200x706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Latest Prices  Bitcoin (BTC) $38577.3, -2.71%  Ether (ETH) $2415.5, -4.05%  S&P 500: 4223.76, -0.54%  Gold: $1826.61, - 1.7%  10-year Treasury yield: 1.554%    The Fed also increased estimates of coming inflation to 3% from the 2.2% projection in March, largely due to transitory factors.      “The upgraded economic forecasts still support an argument that the Fed could announce a progress-dependent tapering plan at the end of summer, with actual tapering starting in January,” wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, in an email to CoinDesk.      Moya expects risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, to see some short-term pressure due to worrisome signs over inflation. Rising prices could result in sooner-than-expected Fed tapering.      The S&P 500, gold, copper and platinum prices dropped as U.S. Treasury 10-year yields rose above 1.5%.    Regulatory developments    Traders had more to grapple with than the Fed’s expectations for an earlier interest rate rise. Crypto markets continue to face pressure from regulators, and it’s not just related to China.      Members of the U.S. House of Representatives have formed a task force to discuss a range of crypto topics, aiming to “engage with regulators and experts to do a deep dive into this poorly understood and minimally regulated industry,” according to U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), chair of the House Financial Services Committee.      And in South Korea, exchanges have halted trading on certain cryptocurrencies as regulatory pressure mounts. The latest move follows an ongoing regulatory crackdown on crypto trading, which included fines imposed on exchange employees caught trading on their own platforms.      Regulatory crackdowns could weigh on crypto prices and keep financial advisors on the sidelines.      In fact, more than 90% of independent financial advisers surveyed by Opinium would not recommend investing in crypto or meme stocks.      For now, traders continue to make long/short bets; on one side balancing regulatory uncertainty, while on the other being attuned to an accommodative macro backdrop that has rewarded risk assets over the past few years.    Elevated hedging costs    In the bitcoin options market, hedging costs remain elevated, indicating that fear caused by the May sell-off has not fully dissipated.      The chart below represents the three-month bitcoin options premia for put contracts with strikes at 80% of the spot price, based on data provided by Skew. The current hedging level is still higher than the May low, which preceded a near 30% price sell-off.      A similar dynamic is seen in the one-week put-call skew, which measures the spread between prices of short-term puts and calls. The put-call skew has drifted from a near 20% high in May but remains elevated relative to prior months.      Options data suggests traders are not overly complacent given the lack of a decisive price breakout from a month-long range.    Bitcoin hashrate decline    The Bitcoin hashrate – the total computational power used to secure transactions on the blockchain – has dropped to its lowest level since November, possibly a reflection of China’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency mining amid concerns over the network’s energy consumption.      The seven-day average hashrate slid to 129.1 million exahashes per second on Tuesday, well off the all-time high of 180.6 million exahashes per second in mid-May, according to data from Glassnode. It’s still up from 105.6 million a year ago.      However, some analysts predict the drop in the Bitcoin hashrate will be reversed eventually, as some miners leave China for other locales.      “Zooming out, the size and rate of the latest decrease is consistent with other previous drops,” wrote Zack Voell, content director at Compass Mining. “After machines shuffle around the map and hashpower relocates to new regions, the steady growth of Bitcoin’s hashrate should resume.”    Altcoin roundup  Banks could one day be key participants in Ethereum 2.0., according to firms including Blockdaemon and Bison Trails. However, decentralized staking pools still need a leg up on Ethereum 2.0 to better compete with their centralized counterparts, a blockchain engineer said.  Ethereum-based decentralized exchange Kyber Network is partnering with the Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution Polygon network to enhance the decentralized finance (DeFi) liquidity.  Trading dashboard Step Finance is aggregating Solana’s decentralized exchanges (DEXs), including automated market maker Raydium, SerumDex and Orca, to give traders faster access to price information.

His entrance to the NFT market came last week with the release of his debut capsule. The 10,000-piece collection was designed in partnership with Playground Studios and is powered by Ether Cards, which specializes in creating adaptable NFT experiences on the Ethereum blockchain.      Through the use of Chainlink data oracles, Ether Cards’ dynamic NFTs can change their visual appearance, using the same technology as smart contracts executing on-chain actions.      “Should LaMelo win ROTY, these NFTs will evolve into a more powerful version, featuring the exclusive Gold Sun,” an announcement on the website created to sell the NFTs said.      The allure of increased rarity appears to be meant to goose sales and nudge interested buyers over the line.

42387119,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWiTp,1623868615,Biden’s New FTC Chair Could Be a Big Web 3.0 Ally,"Yesterday, the Biden administration named Lina Khan, a 32-year-old Columbia Law professor, as the new head of the Federal Trade Commission. Khan, who will be the youngest FTC head ever, is known as a fierce critic of big tech monopolies like Amazon. While there’s often a knee-jerk resistance to regulation and regulators among blockchain advocates, Khan’s concerns make her a potential ally on big issues like privacy. Her antimonopoly work could also create substantial market opportunities for new kinds of tech businesses – including those building decentralized systems and “Web 3.0.”    David Morris is CoinDesk's Chief Insights Columnist. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Enforcing U.S. antitrust law is a major part of the FTC’s mandate, and Khan is probably best known for helping redefine just what a “monopoly” is. She has been crucial, including during seven years at the Open Markets Institute, in developing and promoting the idea that a company can be a monopoly even if its practices drive prices down – even, in fact, if its product is free to consumers. That theory largely hinges on how the firms gather and use data: Khan has been among the loudest critics of the way Amazon uses data gathered through its storefront, such as by leveraging sales data to compete with third-party sellers who are, no less than shoppers, its customers.      Khan may also have a higher chance of advancing her own legislative and regulatory agenda than some other members of the Biden administration. At the most divisive moment in American politics since the 1960s, Big Tech has managed the neat trick of bringing everyone from the progressive Left to the Trump-nationalist Right together in shared hatred and fear. Khan’s own confirmation was bipartisan, with the Senate voting in favor of her 69-28.      That bipartisanship will be tested by looming legislation that would seriously reshape the tech industry, which is coming fast and furious in both houses of Congress. A huge bipartisan Senate package includes a data portability provision of particular interest to Web 3.0 projects, because it could erode Facebook’s ability to lock customers into its walled-garden version of the internet. Such a mandate could also create new demand for a distributed platform for social data.      Such measures are steps toward unwinding the surveillance economy that has allowed companies like Google and Facebook to leverage network effects to build the new kind of data monopoly that Khan helped diagnose. That unwinding would, to whatever modest degree, help people retake some control of their personal data and privacy. Just as important, the antitrust elements of Khan’s agenda could create more space for small startups pursuing novel ideas – almost certainly including more experimentation with privacy-preserving data structures and business models.      But now that she’s in charge of the FTC, antitrust shouldn’t be Khan’s only priority: The FTC also sometimes plays an important role in fighting deceptive investment schemes. In particular, I’ve been writing quite a bit lately about a new wave of celebrity crypto endorsements, some of which may have been undisclosed paid promotions. It’s the FTC’s job to stop such touting activity, but recent actions have been slow and reactive, creating an atmosphere of permissiveness. More aggressive enforcement of those rules could help keep more money in legitimate projects, advancing the timeline for real alternatives to the tech monopolies.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,David Z.

One DeFi observer on Twitter called it a “reverse rug pull,” referring to the crypto slang for when project founders abscond with user funds.      For an unknown amount of time, Alchemix borrowers could deposit ETH, get the project's alETH token in return and then withdraw the ETH used to secure their loans without having to pay them back.      ""I was successfully able to borrow alETH, and take my collateral,"" user ptp1600 said in the Alchemix Discord server.      The issue seemingly affected the alETH pool, which was launched yesterday.      The Alchemix team said it’s investigating the issue and will publish a postmortem shortly. In the meantime, “the alETH contract has been paused and will remain so until our solution is implemented,” the project tweeted.      Alchemix co-founder Scoopy Trooples did not return a request for comment when initially contacted.    Postmortem    Alchemix published a postmortem of the snafu at 3:29 p.m. ET. No user funds were lost, rather users were able to withdraw ETH they should not have.      The bug started around midnight UTC, when users discovered they had “no outstanding debt even though they previously borrowed alETH at a 4:1 collateral ratio,” project admin n4n0 wrote.      It took about 15 minutes for Alchemix to halt the minting of alETH once the team started looking into the issue, n4n0 said.      The root cause: “the alETH vault accidentally created additional vaults,” the incident report notes.      The post concludes with an ask:    “If you would like to support the protocol, the DAO, and the devs, please consider distributing any excess ETH gained during this time to the new Transmuter, to allow it to back the outstanding loans that it created (and you are likely still holding). A portal will be created in the next few days to facilitate this. This will go a long way towards correcting the alETH shortfall and will impact DAO’s treasury much less.”    Alchemix’s native token, ALCX, is down 21.5% since the bug was first noticed, according to CoinGecko.

42387103,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWiEj,1623867077,"Federal Reserve Officials Raise 2021 Inflation Projection, Powell Addresses Asset Purchases","This was the ""talking about talking about"" tapering meeting, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference Wednesday.      “I now suggest that we retire that term which ... has served its purpose well, I think,” Powell said.      He spoke after Fed officials raised their inflation expectations and moved the year for interest rates to rise from 2024 to 2023, based on the ""Summary of Economic Projections"" (SEP) released Wednesday. For the time being, the Fed said it would keep interest rates near 0% and keep buying $120 billion in bonds a month.      The chair wouldn't make any commitments on timing of when the central bank would pare its bond purchases, but the markets now know to expect more conversations about it in the future.      While the economy has ""made progress"" it has not yet made ""substantial further progress.""      ""The economic conditions in the committee's forward guidance will be met somewhat sooner than previously expected,"" Powell said.      The chair also said that there would be a ""a very strong labor market"" coming quickly as ""supply and demand meet"" in the coming months. On the other side of the economic recovery, inflation ""could be actually quite low,"" he added.      ""Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors,"" Fed officials said in a statement released at the conclusion of their two-day, closed-door meeting.      Prices for bitcoin, seen by some traders as a hedge against inflation but also often characterized as a risky asset whose value might drop if monetary policy gets tightened, has slipped 1.6% to about $38,500 since the 2 p.m. ET announcement.      The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. central bank’s monetary policy panel, will keep the target rate for federal funds in a range of 0% to 0.25%, according to the statement. The Fed plans to keep buying $80 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and $40 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities every month.      According to the summary of economic projections:    Federal officials’ median expectation for growth this year in gross domestic product jumped to 7% from 6.5% in March, when they last disclosed projections.  The unemployment rate is seen at 4.5% this year, the same as was projected in March.  Prices for personal consumption expenditures, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, could rise 3.4% this year, compared with a March projection of 2.4%.  The median projection is now for two interest rate increases by the end of 2023, though seven officials now see an initial rate increase as soon as next year. At the March meeting, only four Fed officials were expecting a liftoff that soon. (Not all Fed officials who plot dots are FOMC voting members, which means that the dots are a projection, not a forecast.)    Because current inflation headline numbers in the U.S. are being driven by bottlenecks in the global supply chain as some of the richest countries come out of the pandemic the Fed doesn't feel pressure to taper in response to inflation numbers, said Steven Kelly, a research associate at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, an initiative focused on understanding financial crises.      Wall Street economists and investors have ratcheted up speculation that rising inflation might force the Fed to taper its bond purchases – a form of monetary stimulus known as “quantitative easing,” or QE, that was developed after the 2008 financial crisis. The purchases have swollen the Fed’s balance sheet, which recently topped $8 trillion for the first time in the central bank’s 108-year history.      “I'm sure there's a series of academic papers that have set out that QE’s effect on inflation is 10 basis points or 50 basis points or whatever, so we know the direction is positive and that absent QE inflation will never be lower than vice versa,” Kelly said. “But it's certainly not the potent tool that's going to cause 5% inflation.”      Inflation will become a more structural threat and no longer a transitory threat when the U.S. gets back to full employment, Kelly added.      “They don’t want lumber and rental cars being the reason they end up hiking rates,” Kelly said. “They’ve got evidence now that it takes a lot of employment for inflation to react, so they’re going to take that employment they feel like they can get for free without a structural impact to inflation.”      UPDATE (JUNE 16, 18:44 UTC): Core PCE inflation numbers replaced with total PCE inflation numbers.

42387105,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWiHF,1623860474,Banks Edge Closer to Ethereum 2.0 Staking,"Banks could one day be key participants in Ethereum 2.0.      It’s a trend that will soon garner as much attention as institutional interest in bitcoin, say firms like Blockdaemon and Bison Trails, which provide the infrastructure to make running a staking node on Ethereum 2.0 low risk and easy to deploy.      These hand-holding intermediaries in the staking arena have been surprised by the pipeline of large companies looking to get involved in Ethereum’s next-generation network.      The network’s proof-of-stake (PoS) overhaul provides rewards akin to interest, denominated in ether (ETH), at a time when yields in traditional savings vehicles remain paltry.      “There are some large banks we’re working with, but the regulatory sequencing is important to them and so unfortunately we can't name them at this moment,” said Konstantin Richter, founder and CEO of Blockdaemon, which just closed a $28 million founding round that included Goldman Sachs.    Staking goes institutional    Unlike Bitcoin’s energy-intensive crypto mining system, which seems to be under continual attack from critics these days, the next generation of blockchain networks use PoS, where blocks of transactions are added to the chain by a consensus of individuals, each holding tokens on the network.      Staking validators earn a return for having their tokens locked up on the network, but can also lose some of their stake (known as slashing) if they do not behave consistently or as expected.    Read more: Close to $9B Worth of Ether Is Now Staked on Eth 2.0    There are a number of PoS blockchains in operation today such as Polkadot, Cardano and Algorand, but the most eagerly awaited is the transition of Ethereum away from proof-of-work.      “Ethereum 2.0 is a really big deal,” said Richter, who predicts the transition will make holding ETH in a wallet and earning interest as simple in form as holding a checking account with a bank.      “You simply have a wallet with ETH and it’ll earn interest automatically,” he said.    Proof of Swiss    When it comes to offering institutional staking, probably the most progress has been made in crypto-friendly Switzerland.      For instance, digital asset bank Sygnum is now offering Ethereum 2.0 staking, as per an announcement shared exclusively with CoinDesk.      It’s not the first foray into staking for Sygnum: a couple of months back, the crypto bank allowed its asset management, hedge fund and family office clients to stake on the Tezos blockchain.      It’s part of an incipient suite of digital asset yield-bearing opportunities being offered by Sygnum, which earlier this week announced support for a clutch of major decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens.      Sygnum’s Ethereum staking service will involve locking up multiples of 32 ETH for a currently-undefined period of time, until the transition to Ethereum 2.0. This is expected to generate a yield of between 8% and 6.5% per annum, according to Thomas Eichenberger, head of business units at Sygnum Bank.      “Given its market cap and the importance of the network, Ethereum is getting a lot of attention among institutional clients who are not necessarily knowledgeable about the entire space, but want to focus on some of the largest coins as a first step,” Eichenberger said in an interview.      Sygnum’s institutional staking is “bank-grade,” said Eichenberger, using hardware security provider Securosys to handle the withdrawal keys. (Ethereum 2.0 staking involves both a validator key and a withdrawal key.)      On the digital asset custody side, Sygnum leverages the Custodigit solution, which involves Swiss tech provider METACO, a provider of crypto safekeeping to banks like BBVA, Standard Chartered and GazpromBank Switzerland.    Read more: Spain’s Second-Largest Bank Will Soon Launch Crypto Services: Sources    “One of our target client segments is other banks,” said Eichenberger. “When we talk to these banks, there's always a question about offering staking and on what tokens, and how can you make that available to us and our end clients as well.”      Not to be outdone, the other main digital asset bank in Switzerland, SEBA Bank, is also about to launch Ethereum 2.0 staking, according to Matthew Alexander, SEBA’s head of digital assets.      “We at SEBA are on the cusp of launching staking services to our clients,” he said in an interview, adding:    “Institutional staking is a game changer, because it blows traditional yield products out of the water.”  ‘Tax nightmare’    While instructional interest in Ethereum goes beyond simply trading the token, there are wrinkles still to be ironed out when it comes to earning yield on tokens.      “We've been doing a lot of education sessions with the major banks,” said Evan Weiss, head of business operations at Bison Trails, which was acquired by cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase in January of this year.    Read more: Coinbase Opens Waitlist for Ethereum 2.0 Staking    The technological integration and upkeep of a staking node is not too much of a challenge and can simply be outsourced. But it’s regulatory gray areas like tax and accounting that need to be buttoned up before large institutions can really get comfortable.      Weiss said lots of progress has been made by the Proof-of-Stake Alliance, which is working closely with the IRS on this topic.      “Right now, receiving a staking reward and it being classed as a taxable event is a tax nightmare, both for token holders, but also for tax authorities,” said Weiss. “The goal is to treat staking rewards as any type of new property. So, it's never income when you create that new property, it's income when you sell and dispose of it.”      The added clarity is especially needed given the plethora of PoS protocols hitting the market. Said Weiss:    “Can you name a proof-of-work token that’s launched recently?”",POSITIVE,ETH,ETH | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | XTZ,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/16/banks-edge-closer-to-ethereum-20-staking,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5b82ff535ae50df8fc0a2a823a21dfa77dddd821-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The case against Manor and Pardo and their companies, CG Blockchain and BCT, Inc. alleges that the two hid Manor’s real identity using a combination of aliases and physical disguises, including growing a beard and dying his hair, to hide his past as a convicted criminal. Together, Manor and Pardo raised $30 million from investors for BCT’s product, a blockchain-based alternative to the Bloomberg Terminal, based on fraudulent claims.      The new charges against Ali Asif Hamid, Michael Gietz, and Cristine Page allege that the three served in leadership positions in the ICO. According to an SEC statement, the three have been charged with selling unregistered securities and helping Manor and Pardo conceal Manor’s criminal history and bamboozle investors.      This case is one in a string of cases brought by the SEC against fraudulent ICOs in the wake of 2017’s ICO boom and bust.      So far, only Page has agreed to a settlement that includes permanent injunctions, a disgorgement of the digital assets that she received in connection with the ICO, and a civil penalty of $192,768.

The cash comes in two tranches, a source said: $25 million that’s already locked in, and an additional $10 million being finalized. A mix of family offices, institutional and accredited investors – all subscribers to the video-heavy outlet – backed Real Vision’s Series C.      Real Vision, which covers traditional markets, hedge fund trends, banking, macro (and of course crypto), is quickly developing a cult following from its growing subscriber base.      Pal, who co-founded Real Vision in 2014 after a career as a hedge funder, told CoinDesk he plans to further expand his mini-media empire, which now has over 100 employees. This cash will go toward acquisitions, product development and a new education project, he said.      “We’re planning a massive play in online education, a game-changing expansion of our community platform, and further investment in our Real Vision Crypto channel – as it becomes ever clearer that digital assets are the future of finance.” said Pal.    Crypto media moment    The round comes as financial media brands carefully navigate a changing digital landscape. Some have shunned or even bought out their venture capital backers while others turn to their audience for help building the brand. Real Vision chose the latter: it raises cash exclusively from dues-paying members of the over 100,000-strong club.      “We see a bigger opportunity in creating a large network, bringing together all the financial communities,” the Caymans-domiciled Pal said.      Nico Santini, an investment executive at ProSight Specialty Insurance who places startup bets on the side, is one of those stalwarts. Already a backer of Real Vision’s earlier round, he said in an interview the “depth and breadth” of its financial coverage convinced him to double down.      “It's a no bull website, and a no bull conversation about the market, whereas every other periodical or news organization – they always have their angle,” he said. “It was just very refreshing from my standpoint, because I'm in traditional finance, to really break out of that shell.”    Read more: Andreessen Horowitz Has Its Own Media: So Far That’s a Good Thing    He also said Real Vision gave him his road into crypto. Santini now encourages his friends from traditional finance to dip their toes into the world of bitcoin, Ethereum and DeFi through Real Vision as well.      He much prefers Pal’s style of borderline intimate chats. “Ingesting” Real Vision’s fast-growing library of macro takes and interviews gives him all the financial media he said he needs.      “I rarely read The Wall Street Journal anymore; I never watch CNBC.

42387108,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWiL1,1623853005,Panama to Present Crypto-Related Bill in July,"Next month, Panamanian congressman Gabriel Silva plans to present a bill that could potentially spearhead the adoption of cryptocurrencies as legal tender and create tax incentives for crypto-related businesses.      After El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, announced he was proposing a law to make bitcoin legal tender, Silva tweeted on June 7 that if Panama wanted to become a true hub of technology and entrepreneurship, it should also support cryptocurrencies.    Lee este artículo en español.    ""I found El Salvador’s project positive, ambitious, interesting and with good acceptance,'' Silva said, adding that he seeks to adapt that project to the reality of Panama and constitute a ""positive competition.""      This month Silva and his team will now gather comments from different parties, including lawyers, bitcoin users, crypto-related companies and government officials, the lawmaker told CoinDesk. Panama is the latest Latin American nation to debate cryptocurrencies, joining Paraguay and El Salvador, which recognized bitcoin as legal tender earlier this month.      Silva did not disclose further details about the bill’s specifics, but he said he would define its content after talks with stakeholders.      Panama’s current constitution prohibits the government from mandating only certain currencies as legal tender, Silva said, which could facilitate the incorporation of bitcoin as a currency.      Panama, which does not have a central bank, officially adopted the U.S. dollar in 1904 after a monetary agreement between the two countries known as Taft-Arias.      Balboa, a local currency, also circulates alongside the dollar. It has been tied to the former at an exchange rate of one-on-one since its introduction.      Regarding tax incentives, Silva said that the country already has schemes to attract crypto companies via mechanisms like work permits and tax exemptions.      Panama already serves as headquarters for many transnational companies, which may be related to its reputation as a tax haven.      In its latest list of non-cooperative jurisdictions published in 2021, the European Union listed Panama as a tax haven along with the Virgin Islands and Seychelles, among other jurisdictions.    Seeking consensus    Sliva said that his party, Bancada Independiente, is an independent and opposition party. But Bancada Independiente has a good dialogue with the ruling party and has managed to reach agreement on previous projects, adding that he will try to discuss the project with different ministries of the central administration, such as the economy and finance agency.      Panama is in a different situation from El Salvador, where Bukele's ruling party has a majority in Congress and approved the bitcoin law with 62 out of 84 votes. ""I do not see this being approved in three days, as in El Salvador, but it can be achieved. There is strong citizen support, but we will sit down with everyone necessary,"" he added.      To be approved, the bill must get 36 of the 71 total votes in the chamber of deputies, Silva said, adding that Panama does not have a senate chamber. If approved in congress, the law could be endorsed or vetoed by the president.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Andrés Engler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/16/panama-to-present-crypto-related-bill-in-july,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c59805afb432ea480125e449e68f76e4d3e894fd-2560x1706.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Después de que el presidente de El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, anunciara la semana pasada que propondría una ley para que bitcoin fuera de curso legal en ese país, Silva tuiteó el 7 de junio que si Panamá quería convertirse en un verdadero centro de tecnología y emprendimiento también debía apoyar las criptomonedas.  Read this article in English.  ""El proyecto de El Salvador me pareció positivo, ambicioso, interesante y con buena aceptación"", dijo Silva, y agregó que busca adaptar esa idea a la realidad de Panamá y crear una ""competencia positiva"".  En el transcurso de junio Silva y su equipo recogerán comentarios de diferentes partes, incluyendo abogados, traders de bitcoin, empresas relacionadas con las criptomonedas y funcionarios del gobierno, dijo el legislador a CoinDesk. Panamá es el último país latinoamericano en debatir el uso de criptomonedas después de que lo hicieran Paraguay y El Salvador, nación que reconoció a bitcoin como moneda de curso legal a principios de este mes.  Silva no reveló más detalles sobre las características del proyecto de ley, pero dijo que definirá su contenido después de las conversaciones que tendrá a lo largo de este mes.  La constitución actual de Panamá prohíbe al gobierno imponer el uso de ciertas monedas como de curso legal, lo que podría facilitar la incorporación de bitcoin como moneda en el país, dijo Silva.  Panamá, que no posee banco central, adoptó oficialmente el dólar estadounidense en 1904 tras un acuerdo monetario entre los dos países conocido como Taft-Arias.  El Balboa, una moneda local, también circula junto al dólar. Desde su introducción está atada al primero a una cotización de uno a uno.  En cuanto a los incentivos fiscales, Silva dijo que el país ya cuenta con esquemas para atraer empresas de cripto a través de mecanismos como permisos de trabajo y exenciones fiscales.  Panamá ya es sede de muchas empresas multinacionales, lo que puede estar relacionado con su reputación de paraíso fiscal.  En su última lista de jurisdicciones no cooperativas publicada en 2021, la Unión Europea incluyó a Panamá como paraíso fiscal junto con jurisdicciones como las Islas Vírgenes y Seychelles.  En busca del consenso  Sliva dijo que su partido, Bancada Independiente, es uno independiente y de oposición, pero que posee un buen diálogo con el partido gobernante y ha logrado llegar a acuerdos en proyectos anteriores. El diputado añadió que intentará discutir el proyecto con diferentes ministerios de la administración central, como el de Economía y Finanzas.  Panamá se encuentra en una situación diferente a la de El Salvador, donde el partido gobernante de Bukele tiene mayoría en el Congreso y aprobó la ley de bitcoin con 62 de los 84 votos totales. ""No veo que esto se apruebe en tres días, como en El Salvador, pero se puede lograr. Hay un fuerte apoyo ciudadano, pero nos sentaremos con todas las personas necesarias"", agregó Silva.  Para ser aprobado, el proyecto de ley deberá obtener 36 de los 71 votos totales de la Cámara de Diputados, dijo Silva, quien agregó que Panamá no tiene Cámara de Senadores.

The billionaire investor and Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner has joined dClimate, a decentralized network for climate data, as an investor and strategic adviser.      Cuban’s investment follows a $3.5 million seed round in April, led by CoinFund and Multicoin Capital. dClimate’s founding partner, Sid Jha, declined to share the terms of Cuban’s investment.      The platform aims to be a decentralized marketplace for climate data, forecasts and models, connecting data publishers with buyers. It has a built-in mechanism to score the reliability of data as it is submitted, making the data more transparent.      Cuban has been a vocal proponent of crypto investment and adoption for years. His investment in dClimate, done through his venture capital group, Radical Investments, is one in a string of investments in crypto data startups. However, this investment is the first that indicates Cuban is listening to the environmental concerns touted by figures including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

42423969,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2j3Vh,1623852000,Decentralized Credit Protocol Goldfinch Raises $11M in Series A Funding,"Goldfinch, a decentralized protocol enabling crypto borrowing without crypto collateral, has raised $11 million in a Series A funding round led by venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).  The San Francisco-based company allows unsecuritized borrowers to benefit from decentralized finance (DeFi) lending that would otherwise be beyond their reach because of high collateral preconditions. The capital infusion will allow Goldfinch to build a community of lenders and borrowers who can use the protocol, to widen awareness and for hiring.  “We’re super excited to partner with a16z and other backers who share in our vision,” the company said in announcing the funding and the release of a new white paper. “This gives us the resources we need to build on the protocol’s momentum.”  Among the other investors in the round were Mercy Corps Ventures, A Capital, Access Ventures and Divergence Ventures, and several individuals. “They’re a range of folks from the crypto space and tech startups to experts in emerging markets,” co-founder Mike Sall told CoinDesk. “We wanted our investor base to reflect that we’re a bridge from crypto to the real world.”  In launching the protocol in December, Sall and co-founder and CTO Blake West, who met at the University of Pennsylvania and worked together at Coinbase, were looking to make crypto borrowing more accessible, particularly to individuals and businesses in developing countries with fewer tangible assets to address typical collateral requirements. “The real promise is providing access to capital that is not being served in these markets,” Sall said.  Goldfinch’s community of lenders are a mix of crypto enthusiasts, crypto and credit funds and professionals with traditional financial services experience.  The International Finance Corporation, a sister organization of The World Bank, estimates that about 40% of formal micro, small and medium enterprises in developing countries cannot meet their financing needs. Many of them are far removed from traditional banking services. Cryptocurrency lending has offered new opportunities for them to access capital.  In an emailed statement, a16z general partner Katie Haun noted that the firm was solving “one of the most important unsolved problems in DeFi: undercollateralization.”  “Goldfinch is doing something really special and opening the door to give more people and businesses access to capital.”  West said that Goldfinch’s protocol has already enabled $2.5 million in loans in seven countries, including India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria and Vietnam.

Unlike the setup on a centralized platform such as Airbnb, Dtravel homeowners and house guests share a joint ownership of the platform. Dtravel is community owned through the Dtravel DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), in which peer-to-peer communication and voting are core to the effort. The TRVL token will be the main conduit.      “It really comes down to trust, and this is what we see with blockchain. You can guarantee trust on a level you would never be able to on a centralized platform,” Travala CEO Juan Otero said.      The DAO model allows hosts and guests to vote on issues that include everything from last-minute cancellations to how community treasuries are spent.      Over the past year, COVID-19 has challenged booking companies, which have taken away funds from hosts. With a return to travel, a decentralized platform like Dtravel has the potential to have a global reach, Otero said.      It’s not the first crypto project to attempt this business modeal. Former Uber employees started the Airbnb-esque Bee Token project, but they struggled to find users before they shut down the platform.      Otero said recent developments in blockchain technology and usage could give Dtravel a better fate.      The company plans to incentivize use of cryptocurrency across the platform by enabling the first 100,000 hosts to list their homes on Dtravel to collectively earn more than $35 million in TRVL coins.      Travala.com has more than 3 million listings of homes and hotels and more than 200,000 monthly users, Otero said. The platform offers more than 30 methods of payment, though 70% of users pay with cryptocurrencies.      Dtravel is based on the Binance Smart Chain. Over the past past five months, it has raised $5 million in funds from Kenetic Capital, Future Perfect Ventures, DHVC, Plutus.

In an announcement on Wednesday, Kyber Network said it will expand to the Polygon network on June 30 and launch ""Rainmaker"" – the two-month-old Kyber dynamic market maker (DMM) protocol's first liquidity mining program on Polygon and Ethereum.  ""Through this partnership, Polygon's vibrant ecosystem will gain access to the highly capital efficient and flexible Kyber DMM protocol,"" Loi Luu, co-founder of Kyber Network, said in a press release shared with CoinDesk. ""We believe this will empower more liquidity providers, traders, and developers to effectively engage in the world of decentralized finance.""  The Rainmaker program aims to bring more liquidity to Ethereum and Polygon-based decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems by incentivizing Kyber DMM liquidity providers with $30 million in rewards over three months.  Polygon liquidity providers will receive $5 million with the rest to be paid to Ethereum liquidity providers, Kyber network's spokesperson told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  During the two-month Polygon phase of the liquidity mining program, six eligible liquidity pools will receive 2.52 million Kyber network tokens (KNC) and Polygon's MATIC tokens worth $500,000.  Recipients can employ KNC and MATIC tokens for more liquidity mining. Additionally, KNC tokens can be staked in KyberDAO to participate in Kyber's governance and earn voting rewards.  The Ethereum phase will run for three months and distribute 12.6 million KNC tokens to liquidity pools.  Kyber's dynamic market maker (DMM), aimed at bringing greater flexibility and high capital efficiency by offering liquidity providers amplified pools and dynamic fees, went live in early April.  Polygon's adoption has exploded in recent months with major DeFi protocols switching to the layer 2 scaling solution in a bid to bypass relatively higher fees and congestion on Ethereum.

42387114,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWiSZ,1623848400,Big Time Studios to Push ‘Play-to-Earn’ Through Binance NFT Marketplace,"Big Time Studios, a company focused on bringing crypto-enabled video gaming to mainstream audiences, plans to sell non-fungible tokens (NFTs) through the soon-to-launch Binance NFT Marketplace.      Big Time, recently launched by a team that includes the founder of Ethereum-based metaverse Decentraland, will offer animated NFTs and early access VIP passes to its games, the companies said Wednesday. The sale on the Binance NFT Marketplace will take place on July 15.      Binance’s entry into the NFT sector is expected to bring broader adoption, thanks to a simple interface combined with the largest exchange’s enormous user base.      “The launch of Big Time Studios’ NFT drops on Binance NFT is another step towards our goal of becoming the ultimate destination for AAA digital collectibles,” Helen Hai, head of Binance NFT, said in a statement.    Read more: Decentraland Founder Unveils Project of Bringing NFTs to ‘Big-Time’ Video Games    The link to Binance NFT Marketplace should also help drive the new play-to-earn trend, whereby users can “grind” revenue out of games in the form of NFTs and crypto tokens, according to Big Time CEO Ari Meilich. (A good example is Axie Infinity, where about 100,000 daily users breed, battle and trade digital pets called Axies.)      “A lot of people are actually making a living right now from playing games, particularly people in Third-World countries that got affected by COVID,” Meilich said in an interview. “In our case, players go into dungeons and kill monsters that are going to drop collectible wearables that are backed by NFTs. So by playing or grinding, as it’s called, you can earn items that are worth real money.”      The NFT market exploded earlier this year with some tokenized artworks commanding high prices, such as the Beeple NFT artwork sold at auction for $69 million. The market for blockchain-based title deeds seems to have cooled somewhat, but metaverse and in-game NFTs are expected to remain strong.      Meilich agrees that what happened with NFTs in recent months is not sustainable. But the aggregate volume is pretty much the same, he said, noting that instead of a few big-ticket sales, many more people and projects are entering the market.      “I think it was a tipping point,” Meilich said. “Every gaming company that I speak with now is researching NFTs. They will generally have an NFT team and even if it’s at the R&D stage, they are all figuring out how this is going to disrupt their industry.”",POSITIVE,없음,AXS | EXCHANGE | MANA | MARKET | BNB,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/16/big-time-studios-to-push-play-to-earn-through-binance-nft-marketplace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3a0cb30b46451accc3a44b07849ad495d23e048f-1500x1001.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42387093,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWfdh,1623843000,Valid Points: The Challenge of Decentralized Staking Pools on Eth 2.0,"Decentralized staking pools need a leg up on Ethereum 2.0 to better compete with their centralized counterparts, according to Joe Clapis, a senior blockchain engineer at Rocket Pool.      The leg up that Clapis proposed during a biweekly Eth 2.0 developers call involves tweaking the withdrawal credentials for validator rewards. More on withdrawal credentials and how they might change in this week’s New Frontiers.      But first, let me break down what a validator on Eth 2.0 is and why the term sounds like a misnomer to other proof-of-stake (PoS) communities.    Pulse check    The number of active validators operating on the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain has increased by roughly 4% week-over-week to 166,390. Each of these validators represents a stake of 32 ETH, worth about $82,000 at time of writing. Those stakes are actively accruing interest and earning rewards on the network.    This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk's weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum 2.0 and its sweeping impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to Valid Points here.    The average validator on Eth 2.0 has earned 2.8% on their initial deposit of ether and maintains a balance of 32.89 ETH, according to data from blockchain explorer BeaconChain.      These validators on Eth 2.0, while called “validators,” do not technically validate anything on the network. Their role is to attest and affirm the validity of blocks – and later on users’ transactions – that the network has already accepted.      In the view of Ben Edgington, lead product owner for Eth 2.0 software client Teku, a more accurate term to describe the role of Eth 2.0 validators is something along the lines of Eth 2.0 “attestors.”      “‘Validators’ is not strictly speaking the right terminology, and we are looking at changing it because they don’t really validate anything. They just make votes for what they see,” Edgington said on a “Mapping Out Eth 2.0” podcast episode, which will air Thursday. “It’s probably not the most helpful terminology for us to be using, so we may change it at some point, but it might be a bit late now.”      Eth 2.0 validators also don’t represent individual computers or machines, also called nodes, running Eth 2.0 software, as the term might suggest to some PoS communities. A single node running Eth 2.0 software may support the operations of multiple active validators, provided there is enough CPU and memory capacity on the machine to operate more than one validator.    Hardware requirements    The recommended hardware requirement to spin up a validator on Eth 2.0 using the software client Prysm is a CPU processor with four cores and a minimum clock speed of 2.80 gigahertz. In addition, the computer should have 16 gigabytes of memory and 100 GB of available storage space.      Those recommended requirements for running a validator and earning rewards on the network are on par with other PoS networks.    Delegatory requirements    The most significant difference between validator requirements on Ethereum and those of other PoS networks is the absence of delegation on the protocol level. Avalanche, Near, Solana and to a lesser extent, Cardano and Polkadot operate under a version of PoS known as delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS). The idea for dPoS blockchains was first introduced by Dan Larimer in 2014.      In dPoS blockchains, token holders elect a limited number of delegates, sometimes also called validators, to propose blocks and validate transactions. On some dPoS blockchains, the amount of rewards a delegate earns is proportional to the amount of stake that has been delegated to them. In addition, a proportion of rewards earned by a delegate is usually shared with the token holders who elected them as an incentive for participating in the delegation process.      (As a caveat, the terminology describing the role of delegates and validators in a dPoS protocol may differ depending on the blockchain and the individual.)      On Eth 2.0, which is not a dPoS blockchain, delegation of stake from a token holder to a validator can be done through a third-party staking pool or staking-as-service provider, though that is not explicitly encouraged or supported on the protocol level.      The most popular staking pools and staking-as-a-service businesses that do operate Eth 2.0 validators on behalf of token holders are centralized entities that specialize in creating economies of scale by operating several nodes and validators concurrently.      There are initiatives, which I’ll discuss in more detail in this week’s New Frontiers, to encourage the use of decentralized staking pools on Eth 2.0, though none of them goes so far as automating the process or setting a standard for it on the protocol level, as dPoS blockchains do.    Avoiding stake centralization on a PoS blockchain    One of the dangers for Eth 2.0 as a result of its staking dynamics is that a single large holder of ether – be it a cryptocurrency whale, exchange or staking pool – could monopolize control over the majority of active validators in the network.      To dissuade stake centralization on a hardware and software level, the Eth 2.0 protocol establishes penalties for validator misbehavior that are exponentially larger the more validators are involved in the same event at the same time.      In other words, intentional and accidental violations to the rules of the network become increasingly costly, as well as risky, the more validators a single entity runs.      That was illustrated a few months after the launch of the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain, when 75 validators run by the same staking-as-a-service platform, Staked, were forcibly ejected from the network due to a technical issue in the platform’s staking software. The total penalty on validator earnings amounted to roughly $30,000.      For entities that control a larger percentage of total active validators on Eth 2.0 than Staked, such as cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and Kraken, the penalty for violating the rules of the network can be far greater.    New frontiers    Ethereum 2.0 protocol developers are weighing a decision about whether to add new withdrawal credentials for validator rewards.      Doing so would increase the security and reliability of decentralized staking pools on the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain by adding functionality for guaranteeing a fair distribution of validators rewards to pool participants.      However, unlike the previous addition to validator withdrawal credentials made in March, this one requires code changes to the upcoming backwards-incompatible upgrade, also called a “hard fork,” being planned for Eth 2.0’s merge with Ethereum’s original proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain.      “For it to actually be enforced at the point of the merge, it would require some line changes to the merge, and so it does kind of encumber that process a bit more,” Ethereum Foundation’s Danny Ryan said on a biweekly call discussing Eth 2.0 development. “Ultimately, it ends up being a feature request on top of trying to do the merge at the same time, which, in general, we’ve been attempting to avoid.”      As a result, developers are considering postponing this code change until after the merge or implementing it partially, without any enforcement, in the near term. Also, there is a concern that the new withdrawal credential, which is aimed at guaranteeing fair distribution of staking rewards in a decentralized staking pool, could exacerbate the issue of miner extractable value (MEV).      For more information about MEV and why it matters to Eth 2.0 validators, read this previous issue of Valid Points.    0x01 withdrawal credentials    The proposed withdrawal credentials are an iteration of the credentials that were accepted back in March, which allowed withdrawals of validator rewards directly to an Ethereum address on the original PoW blockchain.      On Ethereum’s PoW chain, ether stored in accounts is secured by cryptography known as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). On the Eth 2.0 Beacon Chain, ether stored in accounts is secured by a different cryptographic signature scheme known as Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS).      The default for withdrawal credentials on Eth 2.0 is a BLS withdrawal key that can unlock validator funds and deposit them to an Eth 2.0 account. However, the option to use the BLS withdrawal key to specify deposits to an account on Ethereum’s PoW blockchain was added later.      This functionality was enabled by creating a “withdrawal prefix.” The prefix, 0x01, was the first step to enabling trustless staking pools on Eth 2.0.      “Under [0x01], when you register your validator, you can register an Eth 1 address, which will be the destination for your funds when you take out your 32 ether plus [rewards]. That withdrawal address can be a smart contract, which will divide [rewards] up between stakers according to whatever rules are laid down so it can be done trustlessly,” Edgington said on a CoinDesk podcast in March.    0x02 withdrawal credentials    What isn’t so trustless about the 0x01 withdrawal prefix is that it only guarantees rewards earned from block proposals and attestations go to an Eth 1 address, but leaves the ability for validator operators to change the address, otherwise called the “coinbase” address, where rewards from transaction fees are deposited.      If the validator operator is also the one earning all the rewards, this kind of flexibility is not an issue, but in the case of decentralized staking pools, validator operators are usually entitled to only a proportion of total rewards from each block.      In the current design for the merge, validator operators could theoretically pocket all transaction fees for themselves by changing the coinbase address where those rewards are deposited and specifying an account that only they control.      That is where the new 0x02 withdrawal credential prefix comes into play. The 0x02 withdrawal credential prefix is identical to 0x01 but with one additional constraint: The default coinbase address of all blocks that a validator proposes must be identical to the validator’s Eth 1 withdrawal address in order for the blocks to be considered valid.      Using the 0x02 prefix forces individuals who are operating validators on behalf of a decentralized staking pool to deposit all returns, including transaction fees, to a specific Eth 1 withdrawal address that is governed by smart contract code to fairly and automatically distribute earnings back to pool participants.      “At the end of the day, [this] isn’t the only solution. It is a promising one, but it’s not the only one,” said Rocket Pool’s Clapis, who proposed a 0x02 withdrawal prefix, during the Eth 2.0 developers call.      “The current mechanics disincentivize decentralized staking in Ethereum, and we are simply looking for some solution that levels the playing field for all the platforms,” he said.

42387071,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBWfFn,1623841365,Bitcoin Enters Wait-and-See Phase Ahead of Fed Statement,"Bitcoin is holding in a tight range as investors' focus turns to the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy statement on Wednesday, which could offer clues on the central bank's course of action and inject volatility into financial markets.      The cryptocurrency has been trading in a narrow range of $39,400 to $41,300 since Monday's European trading hours, CoinDesk 20 data show.      ""The market is completely neutral ahead of the Fed with only a little spot buying,"" Brian Tehako, chief investment officer at Warwick Capital Management, said. ""Traders are waiting for the Fed announcement.""      The event is likely to have a binary market reaction, according to Singapore-based QCP Capital. Binary events are dramatic developments that trigger big moves in either direction.      ""If the Fed remains dovish [retains pro-stimulus bias], cryptocurrencies would have the most upside potential until September at least, given the overselling we've seen relative to other macro markets since May's CPI print,"" QCP Capital noted in its Telegram channel.      Bitcoin tanked from $58,000 to nearly $30,000 in the eight days to May 19. The sell-off began after official data released on May 12 showed the U.S. consumer price index surged to its highest level in almost three years. That renewed fears that Fed would begin to gradually unwind liquidity-boosting stimulus earlier than expected.      However, while bitcoin dropped in the wake of Fed tightening fears, traditional markets remained resilient, with gold ending May with a 7.8% gain and stocks staying strong.      That's left bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general looking relatively cheap heading into the Fed's statement, and so they could benefit the most on the back of a dovish outcome.      On the flip side, a hawkish surprise could weigh on asset prices. ""If they're hawkish on Wednesday, then all bets are off, and we would expect the [crypto] market to revisit recent lows,"" QCP Capital said.      According to Patrick Heusser, the head of trading at Zurich-based Crypto Broker AG, the pain trade could be a ""risk-off"" reaction, resulting in an uptick in safe-haven currencies like the franc, yen and U.S. dollar, and a sell-off in commodities and equities. ""The risk-off could also bring losses for bitcoin,"" Heusser said.      The crypto market appears to be in position for a surge in volatility post-Fed. ""The crypto market looks to be long gamma heading into the event,"" Denis Vinokourov, head of research at Synergia Capital, told CoinDesk.      Gamma refers to the speed of change in the option's delta – the sensitivity of the option's price to changes in the price of the underlying asset. That is, gamma measures the rate of change in the option’s price relative to changes in the spot market prices.      Being long gamma means holding an options position with net gamma greater than zero. In plain English, the position will benefit from a pick up in price volatility of the underlying asset.

The economist told Kitco News in an interview Tuesday that the decision by El Salvador parliament was ""stupid.""  Hanke argued that the ""dollarization"" of the country's economy – El Salvador uses the U.S. dollar as its currency – could lead to bitcoin holders elsewhere, including in Russia, China or Iran, ""sucking up all the dollars in El Salvador like a vacuum cleaner.""  ""All the cash in El Salvador that's in dollars could be sucked up in a short matter of time,"" he said.  Hanke has previously tweeted that bitcoin would not bring down the cost of remittances, as it costs 8% to cash out bitcoin at an ATM, compared with the 0%-4% charged by Western Union or MoneyGram.  The counterargument is that El Salvadorans could spend bitcoin directly without needing to convert it into dollars.  ""Lots of luck,"" Hanke said. ""There's no way [that's] going to happen, period.""  The economist is a crypto skeptic, comparing the market with the Dutch tulip bubble.

The U.S. investment bank based its estimate on a scenario where all citizens in the euro region aged 15 and older transfer €3,000 ($3,600) into a European Central Bank (ECB) digital wallet, Reuters reported Tuesday.  Morgan Stanley said that is a ""bear case,"" using €3,000 as an amount because it was mentioned by ECB policymakers as a theoretical cap for citizens to hold.  ""This could theoretically reduce euro-area total deposits, defined as households' and non-financial corporations' deposits, by €873 billion [$1.06 billion], or 8%,"" Morgan Stanley said.  Smaller euro-zone countries – such as Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia – would be hit the hardest. In these countries, converting €3,000 would be equivalent to 22%-51% of household deposits and 17%-30% of total deposits.  Like the majority of major central banks, the ECB is researching the implications of a central bank digital currency, with the threat to bank deposits often highlighted as one of the potential pitfalls. Should consumers choose to use a digital euro for everyday spending, depleted bank deposits would hamper banks' ability to lend.  ECB President Christine Lagarde said in March that a digital euro is likely to be launched within four years.

Some of those crypto exchanges outlined in the report include Upbit, which has delisted Paycoin, Maro, Observer, Solve.Care and Quiztok. Huobi Korea has halted trading of the Huobi token, while Coinbit has stopped the trading of eight cryptocurrencies and put 28 coins on a warning list, according to the report.

According to a report by the Economic Times on Tuesday, 10 private-sector banks, four public-sector banks and a foreign bank have forged the Indian Banks' Blockchain Infrastructure Company (IBBIC).      The company's new system will verify the data for invoices on goods and services tax and ""e-way bills,"" eliminating paperwork and significantly reducing transaction times. E-way bills refer to electronic-way bills, which is a way to track the movement of goods and services electronically to make sure commerce complies with tax laws.      Executing letters of credit on blockchain has been tested before, but IBBIC's move marks the first attempt for domestic trade finance, according to the report.      Domestic letters of credit act as sureties for the seller that goods or services will be paid for when they eventually arrive.      RBL Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, South Indian Bank, Federal Bank and IDFC First Bank are the 10 private banks.      The four public sector banks include the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Indian Bank, while Standard Chartered is the foreign bank involved in the new company.
