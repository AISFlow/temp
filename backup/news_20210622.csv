42406694,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hr7,1624405979,Goldman Sachs Taps JPMorgan's Private Blockchain for Repo Trade: Report,"Goldman Sachs has conducted its first repo trade using JPMorgan's private blockchain network.      According to a report by Bloomberg on Tuesday, the initial trade was conducted by Goldman on June 17 and came in the form of a tokenized version of a U.S. Treasury bond swapped for JPM coin. The transaction took three hours and five minutes to complete.      JPM coin is the investment bank's stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the U.S. dollar.      “We see this as a pivotal moment for the digitization of transactional activity,” said Mathew McDermott, global head of digital assets for Goldman’s global markets division, per the report.      Repurchase agreements, or repos for short, are a type of loan where financial institutions sell collateralized securities in a contract only to buy them back at an inflated price at some other date, usually overnight. It is particularly beneficial to banks as it enables them to borrow on the cheap.      See also: Goldman Sachs Plans to Offer Ether Options: Report      McDermott said the blockchain development was a huge boon to the repo market, currently valued at over $4.6 trillion globally, given how repos function with collateral and cash being interchanged simultaneously and instantaneously.      “We pay interest per the minute,” said McDermott. “We firmly think this will change the nature of the intraday marketplace.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sebastian Sinclair,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/22/goldman-sachs-taps-jpmorgans-private-blockchain-for-repo-trade-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f3fb2c9740fc0e9d251fab0d366ee1ea7a2c9ba-1500x651.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

However, the price on other exchanges followed the larger market sell-off.      The crypto market has experienced a massive sell-off since Monday as bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market cap, plummeted below $30,000 during early trading hours Tuesday in the U.S., for the first time since January. DOT’s price, along with most of the major alternative cryptocurrencies, also declined, sinking as low as $13.04 in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      However, DOT’s price was one of the biggest winners of the day on Coinbase; it went as high as $22.80 around 12:00 p.m. ET Tuesday, up more than 70% in four hours, according to data from TradingView and Coinbase.      A spokesperson from Coinbase told CoinDesk the team is currently investigating what happened, and said the price discrepancy of DOT between Coinbase and other major exchanges is likely due to the “send and receive” function being disabled as part of “the incident.”      The San Francisco-based crypto exchange also moved the DOT/USD and DOT/BTC trading pairs on its professional platform Coinbase Pro into limited-only mode at 1:35 p.m. ET as a result of the incident.      DOT/USD and DOT/BTC “were moved to limit only to dampen (sic) expected volatility as the asset price reverts to parity with other exchanges once the incident is resolved,” the spokesperson said.      There was an incident regarding DOT trading on Coinbase on June 20, but according to both the website and the spokesperson, a fix was implemented on June 21. The U.S. crypto exchange giant started offering DOT trades on June 16.

42406704,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hx1,1624394597,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Back Above $30K in Volatile Trading Session,"Bitcoin had a volatile Tuesday, briefly dipping below $30,000 for the first time since January before settling around $33,000 at press time. The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value is still up about 11% year to date, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      “The primary reason for the sell-off has been the crackdown in China on mining operations and banking services,” wrote Simon Peters, analyst at multi-investment platform eToro.    Latest prices    Cryptocurrencies:    Bitcoin (BTC) $32542, -0.5%  Ether (ETH) $1907.71, -2.16%    Traditional markets:    S&P 500: 4248.67, +0.57%  Gold: $1776.9, -0.34%  10-year Treasury yielded 1.475% versus 1.493% on Monday    Regulatory pressure from China has always been a headwind for cryptocurrencies, which is why the near-50% decline from all-time highs surprised some analysts.      “The news out of China regarding mining and trading crypto may seem dramatic to newer investors, while those with experience should be accustomed to the progression of this news over the past several years,” wrote Sean Rooney, head of research at crypto asset manager Valkyrie Investments.      Perhaps an intensified regulatory crackdown was not fully priced in given how the price of bitcoin nearly doubled over the past year.      “Today we polled our 950+ person community to gauge their opinion on where the bitcoin bottom may be, and we received split answers for $28,600 and $25,500,” wrote Nick Mancini, research analyst at crypto sentiment data provider Trade the Chain.      Others remain more optimistic about where bitcoin’s price is going. “Bitcoin is currently trading approximately one-third below its long-term exponential trend line,"" a phenomenon it has only exhibited for 20% of the time in bitcoin’s history, according to Stephen Kelso, head of markets at ITI Capital. ""Given the market forces and demand for scarcity assets to protect wealth, ITI believes this is an attractive buying opportunity for investors.""      For now, $30,000 remains a key support level, although technicals show limited upside towards $34,000-$36,000.    MicroStrategy bond stress    MicroStrategy’s latest bond to finance the company’s additional buying of bitcoin is now trading below its face value as the cryptocurrency continues to fall in value.      Prices on the $500 million bond, which closed on June 15, dropped almost three points after the company said on Monday it completed its purchase of 13,005 bitcoin at an average price of $37,617. Bitcoin was trading at around $32,542 as of press time.      At last count, MicroStrategy held 105,085 bitcoins. The company so far issued more than $1.5 billion in convertible notes and junk bonds to fund such purchases.    Decline in active addresses    Blockchain data shows low demand for transactions over the past few months.      “Both Bitcoin and Ethereum have experienced dramatic slowdowns in on-chain activity, with active addresses and total transfer volume falling back to 2020 and early 2021 levels,” wrote Glassnode in a newsletter published on Monday.      Bitcoin’s active addresses have fallen 24% from the March peak, while Ethereum’s fall in active addresses has been more extreme, dropping 30% from peak levels.    Digital asset funds face outflows    Digital asset investment products saw a third consecutive week of outflows, totaling $79 million for the week ending June 18. This is now the longest bear run in outflows since February 2018 when there were seven consecutive weeks of outflows, according to a report by CoinShares on Monday.      “The focus of outflows continues to be bitcoin, which has endured its sixth consecutive week of outflows totaling $89 million,” wrote CoinShares.    Open interest in bitcoin futures drops    The total open interest in the bitcoin futures market is sitting at $11.3 billion, down 59% from its April 13 peak of $27.3 billion, according to Arcane Research.      The downward trading indicates institutional investors are being “cautious” at the moment, Arcane said in a report. It also notes that three-month futures in bitcoin are in ""backwardation,"" meaning they are traded at a discount to current spot prices. That is generally perceived to be a bearish signal.    Altcoin roundup  CoinDesk’s columnist Lex Sokolin explained why ether’s price is built on firmer ground than bitcoin's. Bitcoin's thesis rests on a theory of money and power, while ether has a more durable footing: creative computation, according to Sokolin.  Regulated crypto bank Anchorage Digital said it will provide custody and staking support for FLOW, the native token of the Flow blockchain.  Crypto custody provider Fireblocks is being sued by a company that claims it lost access to more than $70 million worth of ether, according to a report by Calcalist. Fireblocks said it is investigating the issue.

42406695,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hq8,1624391544,China's Anti-Crypto Crackdown Is Different This Time,"Old crypto hands have been through so many waves of China FUD they might shrug off the current round of anti-cryptocurrency enforcement there as insignificant. Sure, the market is crashing, in part, because of the news, but we’re also coming off a major market top. It’s all just part of the cycle, right?      Unfortunately, that thinking seems suddenly and dramatically outdated. China is more serious about this anti-crypto crackdown than it has been in the past, and the impacts could be more lasting and deeper.    David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist.    We’ve already seen evidence of a new kind of seriousness in the exodus of cryptocurrency miners from China in recent weeks. The good news is that, as Nic Carter has broken down for CoinDesk, the big miner migration will not have a defining influence on the robustness of the Bitcoin network. In fact, it could even be a net long-term positive if it spreads mining, and its risks, to more countries. And there's no strong, direct line from mining activity to the market price of bitcoin.      But mining is less than half the story here: China is also effectively restricting cryptocurrency trading with the same renewed ferocity. On Monday, Chinese financial authorities reminded major banks and fintech companies they weren’t supposed to be facilitating cryptocurrency-related transactions. After the meeting, China’s central bank (PBOC) issued a public statement urging banks to crack down harder on them.      These were rules first laid out in 2013, according to ABC News. But in May, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) reminded everyone it really meant it, and the Monday meeting seems to have driven the point home. The Agricultural Bank of China, for instance, said on Monday it would implement a due diligence process to spot cryptocurrency-related transactions. Detection of such activity, AgBank said, could lead to account suspension.      It’s important to note this scrutiny would likely fall on individuals as much or more than on cryptocurrency businesses. That’s because such businesses are thin on the ground in China proper: Most notably, cryptocurrency exchanges were banned from the country in 2017, leading to the shutdown of domestic operations by the likes of Bobby Lee’s BTCC.      But those shutdowns, for the most part, shifted Chinese fiat-crypto flows to over-the-counter (OTC) desks run by the offshore exchanges Huobi and OKEx. Those gateways allow Chinese individuals to swap yuan for USDT or bitcoin, then move that crypto to international non-fiat exchanges like Binance for further speculation. This round of statements from PBOC cites OTC desks specifically for the first time, according to The Block’s Wolfie Zhao, and includes stronger language around possible suspension of their banking privileges.      While China has not banned the ownership of cryptocurrency, stronger enforcement could also damp interest among individual speculators by increasing the risk, or perceived risk, of individual punishment. Possible punitive measures include more than losing a bank account: Though it’s not spelled out in the current round of statements, it seems likely an individual involved in a flagged transaction could also be permanently downgraded in China’s (also nebulous) “social credit” system, a blacklist that can restrict access to everything from airline flights to high-speed internet, apparently with little in the way of due process.      Even talking about cryptocurrency seems suddenly less acceptable to Chinese authorities. Multiple reports say accounts focused on the subject have been banned from social media platforms including Weibo. One Chinese crypto commentator referred to the social-media crackdown as “judgment day” for crypto thought leaders in China. That seems likely to further damp interest in crypto speculation, since social media is so key to generating interest in new projects.    Read more: David Z. Morris – Of Course China Is Anti-Bitcoin: Look What Happened to Jack Ma    This could mean real, long-term downward pressure on crypto prices. According to a 2020 Chainalysis report, more than 30% of global crypto trading takes place in East Asia, a share that is dominated by China. Losing a double-digit percentage of global volume would be particularly bad for the smallest projects.      Some might even see a deterrent to individual crypto trading in recent high-level actions against business figures. Less than a year ago, Alibaba founder Jack Ma was preparing for the initial public offering of Ant Group, a payments spin-off of the e-commerce platform. Authorities dramatically kiboshed that deal, allegedly in response to Ma’s defiant statements towards financial regulators. Ma, until last year the most famous technology entrepreneur in China, is now basically invisible, reportedly spending his time painting and doing charity work. Life comes at you fast, especially in an authoritarian society.      Such dramatic actions take on an outsized role in a system like China’s, where there can be big gaps between the law on paper and the law in practice. Historian Michel Foucault argued that the rise of dramatic and cruel public punishments like quartering in early modern Europe were meant to not just inflict pain on offenders but instill fear in observers, warning them against making the same mistake.      While there may still be space for cryptocurrency in China, it seems the CCP authorities have finally concluded they have little to gain from nurturing anti-authoritarian technology. On the whole, their loss could be the world’s gain but there are still likely turbulent waters ahead.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,David Z.

42406699,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hv3,1624390420,Security Token Market Shows Signs of Resurgence,"A recent large-dollar funding round by Securitize signals that security tokens may be poised for a comeback.      If so, more private companies will bypass traditional initial public offerings (IPO) and instead use blockchain technology to digitize the capital-raising process. Some in the industry now go so far as to predict a sixfold increase in the total dollars raised using such funding methods over the next four years.      Securitize, which helps private companies raise money by issuing tokens, completed a $48 million Series B fundraising round on Monday. Morgan Stanley and Blockchain Capital co-led the round, which was oversubscribed.      While this niche failed to live up to the hype of the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency boom, several firms interviewed by CoinDesk said they expect the security token industry to finally take off on a global scale, citing strong demand from issuers and investors. Security tokens are digitized versions of traditional instruments such as stocks and bonds. Some even expect this industry to surpass the market volume for cryptocurrencies in the next five years.      In terms of proceeds, the global security token market could reach $3 billion by 2025, growing at 56.9%, compounded annually, according to security token marketplace Area2Invest.      “Two years ago, there was no infrastructure for a security token marketplace: no licensed platforms, broker-dealers, and no transfer agents,” said Max Dilendorf, a crypto lawyer at Dilendorf Law in New York. “The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) recent [registration] of Securitize as a transfer agent is yet another sign that the industry is prepared for take-off.”    Shunning IPOs    A security token offering can give companies room to remain private longer and expand their investor base without the burdens of being a public company, proponents say.      “The shine has come off launching an IPO. Companies are staying private longer and most of a company’s value is generated when it is private and young,” said Carlos Domingo, CEO of Securitize.      In May, crypto wallet provider Exodus concluded a $75 million offering of its Class A common stock using security tokens.      The offering came after the SEC’s decision to raise the Regulation A limit, allowing companies to raise up to $75 million in a 12-month period for individual investors, generally only permitted for accredited and institutional investors in traditional capital raising methods.    Due diligence required    However, not all security tokens are quality offerings.      “Investors are judging unique offerings based on the expected return on investment,” said Dave Hendricks, CEO of Vertalo, an Austin, Texas-based startup that helps issue and manage digital securities. “Many of the early security token offerings were micro-funds (sub-$10 million market cap). Founders decided that issuing a security token would attract a class of investors that were more interested in how the security was formatted rather than the underlying quality of the offering.”      Despite optimistic projections, market participants caution that widespread adoption of security tokens will take time.      “Adoption of security tokens has been slower than we originally anticipated as regulatory view and market adoption takes time,” wrote Saum Noursalehi, CEO of tZERO, a provider of blockchain technology for security tokens. Still, there are early signs of growth. For example, tZERO noted a recent uptick in issuer interest with $54 million traded on the platform in 2020, up from $5 million in 2019, according to the company, in an email to CoinDesk.      And others are seeing even more activity, indicating what could be ahead.

42406682,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7heK,1624388520,Alchemy Supports Another Ethereum Scaling Solution. This Time It’s Optimism,"First Arbitrum, now Optimism.      A pair of Ethereum scaling solutions will be supported by Alchemy, the developer platform announced Tuesday. Optimism’s mainnet launch is set for July.      Gas fees and transaction speeds have been a recurring hurdle for Ethereum users and stymied the network's ease of use. At times transactions on Ethereum cost more to execute than the value of the transaction itself. This has led to a search for alternative layer 2 solutions, resulting in projects like Polygon and Matter Labs’ zkSync pulling in major funding rounds.      Optimism itself has been a beneficiary of this search, raising $25 million in February in a round led by VC giant Andreessen Horowitz.      “Layer 2s are becoming a practical and imminent way to reduce the biggest pains Ethereum users have,” said Alchemy Product Manager Michael Garland. “Alchemy’s partnership is playing a huge role in getting the technology adopted by the biggest applications.”      Using optimistic rollups, Optimism’s gas costs are 35 times cheaper than Ethereum’s.    Why Optimism?    Optimism uses rollup technology to help scale Ethereum apps. A rollup is a sidechain aggregation of transactions in a smart contract that will settle to the mainchain at some future point. The “rollup” aspect refers to the way the sidechain bundles many transactions to be committed to the mainchain.      Optimism, previously known as Plasma Group, was a pioneer in “optimistic rollups,” meaning that state changes are first published with minimal inspection and fraud checking, allowing for additional speed. Any user can flag invalid updates, though, with the transgressor being punished by the protocol.      When asked what made Optimism stand out from other layer 2 solutions, Alchemy’s Garland said the biggest difference is in how Optimism resolves fraud.      “Optimism uses a mechanism that makes fraud proofs much quicker,” he said.    More layer 2s to come    Garland said this won’t be the last layer 2 Alchemy supports. Consider this a continuation of meeting developers where they are when it comes to making tech adoption less onerous, he said.      “Optimism has a ton of high-profile projects like Uniswap and Synthetix committed or already using their network, plus there’s a lot of excitement among the rest of the developer community for Optimism,” he said.      The Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM) is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which means Ethereum developers can migrate existing smart contracts without them breaking.      “Alchemy is a world class engineering team providing critical infra support to the Ethereum ecosystem,” Jinglan Wang, CEO and founder of Optimism, told CoinDesk via email. “We're so stoked to have their support on this insane journey to the wild west of technology.”      Alchemy is said to power 70% of the top Ethereum applications and over $30 billion in on-chain transactions.      “Optimistic Ethereum is poised to have a massive impact on the blockchain world with transformational tech,” said Alchemy CEO Nikil Viswanathan. “We’re excited to help power the ecosystem’s growth.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/06/22/alchemy-supports-another-ethereum-scaling-solution-this-time-its-optimism,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26094eba3b9a6d63752d7c9c8521fba589695ceb-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406700,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hw2,1624386761,Why Ethereum's Price Is Built on Firmer Ground Than Bitcoin,"BTC is up 245% and Ethereum is up 730% over a one-year period. Of course, both are now down a lot over the last month. But the price on its own tells us very little information.      The efficient market hypothesis would have us believe that information advantages, like knowing what a blockchain is, or thinking that a network with no transactions is worth less than a network with transactions, get absorbed into markets through arbitrage opportunities. If you have an information edge, no matter how fundamental or obvious or small, you act on that edge and get rewarded through profits over some time period. Therefore, incentives force rational actors to rationalize irrational markets.    Lex Sokolin, a CoinDesk columnist, is Global Fintech co-head at ConsenSys, a Brooklyn, N.Y.-based blockchain software company. The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter.    But let’s not forget that social media and memetics exist, in part, to make machines out of our lizard brains and network them into the limbic system of the internet of attention.      The price, then, is not just a cold calculation of truth revealed. Rather, the price is a signal to be politicized, warred over and worshipped. If you can more easily move the sacred number with your heart than with your mind, which would you choose? No need to do math homework. Just join the bannered tribe of the Bitcoin maximalists, Link Marines, XRP Army, Doge army or some other multi-agent Twitter centaur, and tear into anything and everything that stands counter to your narrative.      The fact that people dote on price, and do nothing but talk about it – as a flag – is not new. But perhaps the amount of purchasing that is done based on that flag-waving alone is novel with leading cryptocurrencies. Financial rallying cries are now the norm to teach enemies their lesson in financial ruin.      Correlations are another data point here. Coin Metrics has a fantastic tool for plotting crypto asset correlations here. We can see correlations across projects starting to converge to the 0.6 to 0.8 range. Assets with very different stories, such as bitcoin, ethereum, Uniswap, Aave, Binance and Yearn are collapsing any difference in performance toward higher and higher correlation.      Perhaps that signals a lack of discrimination from institutional actors when they take an asset allocation approach. This would imply putting money into a “sector,” rather than into a project. Thus you would put 10% of your hedge fund into crypto, rather than into particular assets. Then, when there is a need to deleverage or rotate into a different position, you would reduce a portion of your overall allocation, and thereby impact all the sub-component parts. But it’s a bit hard to believe. Being pioneers among their peers, the crypto funds playing in the space are immensely sensitive to risk and market structure.      Bitcoin’s status as a store of value has retail actors selling off well-performing but non-core assets to park whatever remains into bitcoin. As the market overall has become bearish, selling off winners to pay off collateral calls or to turn off risk starts making sense. This seems more likely, and also sucks.    Bitcoin’s fundamentals    If you want to be rigorous in thinking about crypto networks, what are the metrics to actually track?      Bitcoin and ethereum come with very different stories, and thus what to track is quite different. Bitcoin is digitally scarce, and therefore can be viewed as “hard and sound” money. The hardness refers to how difficult it is to create additional units of the currency. It is backed by its mathematical truth – with supply limited as pre-ordained by code. While the Chinese authorities may attempt to stomp out bitcoin mining like a weed, it does little to change the network’s ability to secure transactions and generate a store of wealth for people who want to do so away from their governments.      In this way, Bitcoin is a political tool aimed at sovereigns, meant to strip away their monopolies on wealth. To the extent that a country cannot collect taxes, control its economy through monetary policy and otherwise rule its people economically, that country is not sovereign in the medieval sense. When a decentralized internet nation comes with its own decentralized internet currency, and promises of freedom and happiness, citizens of a country have an easily accessible alternative to the hegemon. We may soon find a better social contract with a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) than with a corporation or a nation. Thus the sovereign will use force to enforce the social contract it finds existential.      Bitcoiners, however, believe market forces to be inexorable, assuming infinite demand. For example, the ""Bitcoin Stock to Flow"" pricing model takes the schedule of BTC emissions with its halving events and overlaps it nicely on a logarithmic scale with the BTC price. Thus, the harder it is to generate the next bitcoin, the higher the price of bitcoin will be.      But maybe this is also just two exponential charts overlaid on top of each other? Like, you take one number and divide it by two and then you take another number and you multiply it by two, and then you mess around with the vertical axis until your time period matches.      Another bit of the puzzle, when you know what supply looks like, is to try to project demand. There are various analytics about which types of accounts are selling (e.g., large of small), institutional inflows and outflows, and other leading indicators to transaction count. This is an attempt to quantify how people feel about the future, and all sorts of alchemy exists in looking at social sentiment.      In our opinion, still some of the best charts for understanding the current valuation of bitcoin have been developed by Willy Woo and are available here. The NVT (network value to transactions) cap, which is based on historic money flows relative to network value, suggests bitcoin should be worth over $1 trillion. The value of all coins at the price of their last transaction is $370 billion. The market is floating somewhere in the middle.      Note, however, that the main variables in all these models are how bitcoin relates to its own value. It is valuable to the extent people paid for it – the store of value – and at what rate they are performing such activity. And frankly, we can’t tell apart correlation and causation, because by design much of finance is recursive, reflexive and self-similar.    Web 3.0    It is a breath of fresh air to switch from talking about existential geopolitics and who gets to be the money god – a monarch, a president or a computer program – to talking about creative computation.      Once you layer in programmability into blockchains, you are no longer constrained into talking about money. Yes, money is lovely. But it is also a mere derivative of actual things that actual people do. Money does not exist without some work that has gone into the tangible world, and then became abstracted into something else.      To us, it is that work that is important. While upgrading the transformation function that saves abstractions to be more modern and free is a gigantic opportunity, can’t we have a digitally native economy first instead of worshipping a golden calf?      Paying for your sandwich in BTC or Apple stock is not a digitally native economy. Building software that runs on Ethereum, or another bridged computational blockchain, definitely is.      Having open-source, mutualized financial engines that provide the best financial functionality in the world is a worthwhile goal. Fixing the original sin of the internet by rewiring human creativity out of attention-eating advertising monsters and into economic exchange seems like a pretty good goal too. Designing, congealing and governing an emerging metaverse to make the cyber expanse feel grounded and worth inhabiting may be the largest goal of all.      To that end, we find it much easier to root in Ethereum’s fundamentals because it welcomes non-canon extensions, whether they are scalability networks like Polygon, Optimism or Arbitrum, or whether they are the myriad decentralized applications extending the financial uses of ETH through trading, lending, investing, insurance, structuring and asset management.      The more others build, and the easier it is for them to build and therefore generate economic exchange and transactions, the better off everyone becomes. This is like watching the number of applications grow in Apple’s iOS or the number of merchants connected to Alibaba go through the roof.      To believe in the future of the crypto economy, you don’t have to believe in stories about sovereigns, digital or flesh. Rather, you have to believe in stories about the benefits of non-coercive peer-to-peer economic exchange. To that end, instead of swapping out old governments for the internet, the thesis is that you are swapping out the old economy for the internet. This then is our favorite chart, showing how Ethereum’s 1-plus million in daily transactions is now combined with another 7 million daily transactions from Polygon.      Or maybe this one, showing 135 million contract calls in May – the song of software running code.      As the crypto markets continue to display both (1) pronounced volatility and (2) increased correlation between different asset types, it’s important to articulate the main difference between the motivating purpose of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We do not think crypto prices are telling a useful or clear story, so it is worth considering the fundamentals of what one is betting on to become true.      Bitcoin and Ethereum/Web3 are aiming for quite different goals and will take very different paths to get there. Perhaps during some beautiful singularity, they will converge. The Twitter universe will yell at you until you comply to its price narrative, so be vigilant and pay attention to core principles.

The report said the downward trading indicates that institutional investors are being “cautious” at the moment. It also notes that three-month futures in bitcoin are in backwardation, meaning they are traded at a discount to current spot prices. That is generally perceived to be a bearish signal.      Open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as a share of total bitcoin futures was climbing at the end of May, but is now trading downward. The CME's open interest is currently sitting at 12.2% of the bitcoin futures market, according to the report. That puts it in fourth place, behind retail platforms Binance (22.5% of total open interest), OKEx (14%) and Bybit (12.9%).      “I think it’s safe to say that institutional interest has waned,” said Nathan Cox, chief investment officer at Two Prime. Cox said that institutions remain “hungry” for crypto as a whole, but their ability to step in is limited by the recent volatility in the market.      Meanwhile, some note the decline in futures activity indicates that other market participants are also stepping back.      “What this shows is a lot of retail traders got burned when the market started to come lower,” said Patrick Heusser, head of trading at Crypto Finance AG.

The fundraising round was also backed by early investors Neotribe, Acrew Capital and Seraph Group.      A representative for Third Point Ventures, which received a CipherTrace board seat, confirmed its participation in the funding, in an email to CoinDesk. Loeb’s investment companies have now backed three crypto startups, including Bitwise and eToro.      CipherTrace plans to double its 100-person operation by June 2022 as it tries to capitalize on the growing market for crypto intelligence. It’s hardly alone in the field. TRM Labs and Chainalysis have raised capital in the last three months, Blocktrace unveiled a new software product on Monday, and Elliptic announced today that it has completed a pilot project with Santander, Spain's largest bank, to detect suspicious activity.      “It's a good time to be in our space,” CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans told CoinDesk in an interview. He said in the wake of the recent ransomware attacks, the firm has experienced an uptick in business from recovery firms, government agencies, law firms and insurance companies. Banks too. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in basically everything we're doing now.”    Read more: TRM Labs Raises $14M as Crypto Tracking Steps Into Spotlight    CipherTrace sells compliance tools to crypto exchanges, government investigators and banks. It compiles intelligence on wallets to help organizations track transactions, but doesn't share data on individuals.      Jevans said it's up to the courts to unmask individual wallet-holders; his company just helps investigators move from point A to B.      Rolling out specialty intelligence software has been one recent CipherTrace strategy. It launched a sanctions compliance platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects in April as the market for tools used to comply with the Financial Action Task Force “travel rule” is “really heating up,” Jevans said. The global financial watchdog announced rules in 2019 to combat the use of cryptcurrencies in money laundering and funding for terrorists.      Another target area has been privacy coins. CipherTrace claims it can occasionally break through the veil of secrecy of monero, a cryptocurrency that has been used by criminals. Jevan said that while his team is “supportive of the monero project,” he insisted the privacy coin is doomed to fail without some degree of oversight and noted that blockchain tracing and compliance tools are necessary if cryptocurrency is going to flourish.      “We’re not gonna get the next billion people into the market without these tools,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | XMR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/22/daniel-loebs-third-point-leads-27m-investment-in-crypto-compliance-startup-ciphertrace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4579b851adc29a01ab39fbf5705072bb4dcfed85-1500x1017.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In September 2020 the European Commission presented a proposal for regulation of the crypto market, but the rules won’t be in place for several years, the FSA noted.  “Until such regulations are in place, anyone considering trading in cryptocurrency should think carefully and understand the significant risk that such investments entail.

42406696,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hp9,1624380100,Digital Ownership Is Getting Heated,"For some Texans, the dystopian sci-fi future we’re all dreading arrived late last week when state energy providers remotely changed home thermostats during a heatwave. As part of an energy-saving program called Smart Savers Texas run by a company called EnergyHub, participants opted to have their smart thermostats automatically adjusted during times of peak demand. This was in exchange for lowered power bills and entry into a $5,000 sweepstakes.      But it took many by surprise.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    It’s important to stress the program was optional and that participants could opt out at any time. Thermostat adjustments would only last one to four hours at a time on weekdays from June 1 through Sept. 30, excluding holidays. ""During summer peak energy demand days, we may briefly adjust your thermostat settings by a few degrees,"" CPS Energy, a Texas energy provider, said on its website. ""We'll do this only as needed.""      Still, the event raises questions about the “ownership” of gadgets we allow into our homes. Proprietary software often comes with hidden terms and license agreements. No one reads the fine print. This was likely why so many Texans woke up in a sweat last week, but it’s happened before. There are reports of “smart locks” locking people out of their homes and Ring alarms becoming part of the surveillance state.      “The internet itself has become owned and captured by big banks and companies,” Mikey McManus, a technology consultant and co-author of “Trillions: Thriving in the Emerging Information Ecology” told CoinDesk last fall. “Not everything should be connected.”      Much of McManus’ work centers around preparing people for a reality where the world of atoms has been thoroughly disrupted or replaced by bits. We’re well on our way to an internet of trillions of nodes, or a “sea of informational devices,” where everything we do or touch is somehow integrated into the cloud. This new, potential data-centric epoch in human history is sometimes called the internet of things.      “When we shift to trillions of computational devices, it's not information in the device. It’s us living in the information,” McManus said. This could be a blessing or a curse, depending on how much authority we grant these devices to shape the world around us. And whether human operators are privy to know why or how adjustments are made.      Bill Gates’ $123 million mansion famously had temperature and lighting systems installed that would adjust to guests’ preferred settings. That level of luxury is now available to middle class consumers with smart thermostats. But did we trade comfort and convenience for ultimate control?      As tech firms and governments become ever intertwined, we should remember what we may be giving away when we go digital. For some, crypto is a digital revanchist movement – an attempt to reclaim ownership rights over cyberspace. This includes money, obviously, but also identity and communities. I don’t know if a blockchain would have prevented what happened during the Texas heatwave, or if that would even be preferable, but I do know the conversation around digital ownership is only getting more heated.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/22/digital-ownership-is-getting-heated,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e83775a622e83ad6182d74256523e9008161641b-2560x1708.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406688,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hlD,1624377915,Treasury Nominees Pledge to Enforce New Crypto Regulations,"A pair of nominees for the U.S. Treasury Department pledged to, if confirmed, ensure new anti-money laundering (AML) regulations involving cryptocurrencies would be implemented.      President Joe Biden (D) nominated Brian Nelson to be Under secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes and Elizabeth Rosenberg to be assistant secretary for Terrorist Financing earlier this year. The Senate Banking Committee held a confirmation hearing on Tuesday to debate their nominations, addressing different issues around financial crimes and whether or not crypto plays a role.      In response to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) asking the nominees how they would limit the damage from crypto-related crimes, Nelson noted the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020, a bill passed into law last year, already tasks the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) with applying new crypto-related regulations.      ""Obviously this is an issue that was [and] has been a great concern for some time now, and it's reflected in the new Anti-Money Laundering Act that this committee really championed,"" he said. If confirmed he said he ""would prioritize implementing pieces of that legislation including new regulations around cryptocurrency.""      The Treasury Department's Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes office would have to work with its international partners to address crypto crimes, he added.      Likewise, Rosenberg noted that international cooperation is needed to tackle cryptocurrency-related crimes. She said she would ""seek to ensure"" that any cryptocurrency regulations are both appropriate and consistent across different jurisdictions.      Part of TFFC's mission is to coordinate with international offices to ensure different nations all have similar regulatory regimes, she said.      ""Without that kind of collaboration and … regulatory framework, it's all too easy for criminals to avoid the U.S. jurisdiction and conduct their illegitimate activity from another jurisdiction,"" she said.      The nominees' comments reflect a growing level of scrutiny around the role cryptocurrencies play in different sorts of crimes. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen repeatedly brought up concerns around crypto use in terrorist financing during her own confirmation process, and recent ransomware attacks have drawn further attention to cryptocurrencies.      ""It reflects a balancing of regulating to prevent virtual currency and other types of new technology from undermining our AML system while also being respectful of the fact that we need to support responsible innovation and preserve that here in the U.S. and not see that leave the country,"" Nelson said.",NEUTRAL,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/22/treasury-nominees-pledge-to-enforce-new-crypto-regulations,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0a9660f5f1d6be5bb8f2f8d54f5e31a51e1ab3c0-1920x1079.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406687,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hmC,1624377645,Brave Launches Privacy-Preserving Search Engine in Beta,"Privacy-oriented web browser Brave has launched a new feature in beta, Brave Search, which does not track users’ searches or what they click on.      The browser looks to rival other search engines: Google is top of mind but other firms like DuckDuckGo have carved out a small but growing niche among tracking-wary web users.      “Brave Search extends the same privacy and independence guarantees that Brave has made to browser users,” Brave CEO Brendan Eich told CoinDesk in an email. “Brave Search is based on an independently built search index, whereas other search engines are critically dependent on big tech search engines under the hood.”      The new service offers fully anonymous searching and is transparent regarding how search results are ranked, Brave added.      Brave Search is based on Tailcat, the open search engine Brave acquired in March. The move continues Brave’s march to build a competitive and private alternative to other browsers, with Brave News being another recent addition.      Prior to this, Brave had only been able to offer search through third-party providers. While that met some of the company’s needs, Eich said Brave realized the search experience could be improved upon.      “In spite of the need for a better search experience, most search engines are not equipped to build one,” Eich, the developer of JavaScript and a co-founder of the Mozilla Project, said, adding:    “In fact, nearly every single Western search engine is nothing more than Google or Bing search under a different name, a so-called skin. Because we don’t rely exclusively on Big Tech search engines under the hood as other private search engines do, we’re able to give our users the privacy guarantees they expect from Brave products.”  Read more: Brave Acquires Tailcat to Create Private Search Engine Competitor to Google    Brave Search uses an anonymous crowd-based indexing algorithm (so it can scale user growth to cover pages that matter) and doesn’t have to crawl the entire web just to answer common queries. Some features, like images, will still be accessed from Microsoft Bing.      Google is still the elephant in the room. According to one estimate, the search giant does as many searches in about 12 minutes as DuckDuckGo does in a day.      Brave Search will not display ads during the initial phase of the beta, but plans to offer both ad-free paid search and ad-supported free search options. The company will consider bringing private ads with BAT revenue to Brave Search at a later date.      Said Eich: “As Brave Search grows, the anonymized contributions from the community will improve and refine our results, and will help Brave Search provide the relevant results that will make it on par with big search engines, minus the tracking.”",POSITIVE,BAT,BAT | BUSINESS | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/22/brave-launches-privacy-preserving-search-engine-in-beta,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/211a2a4215e003daac0d6a704317e151f3ffdb4d-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406684,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hiG,1624374811,MicroStrategy Falls With the Bitcoin It Holds; Breakeven Point Looms,"Shares of MicroStrategy are falling Tuesday, dragged down by the collapse in the price of bitcoin (BTC), the cryptocurrency the firm's CEO has bet the business-intelligence software company's future on – a wager that could soon become a money-losing one if bitcoin drops much further.    MicroStrategy exploded onto the crypto scene last summer after CEO Michael Saylor used the company's treasury reserves to buy bitcoin. And then he bought some more. And so on. And so on. At last count, the firm held some 105,085 bitcoins, making the firm by far the cryptocurrency's largest known corporate holder.  Up until a little more than two months ago, with the bitcoin bull market in full swing, that bet was paying off handsomely. Now, not so much. After reaching an all-time high of more than $64,000 in mid-April, the price of bitcoin has more than halved for several reasons, including concerns about the environmental impact of mining for bitcoin, a crackdown on crypto by China and fears of a hostile regulatory climate in the U.S.  With the price of bitcoin currently at around $29,000, it's about $3,000 per coin above the average price of $26,080 that Saylor shelled out for his bitcoin. Should bitcoin fall below that, MicroStrategy's bitcoin gamble would become a money-losing one.  As it is, if bitcoin doesn't rebound in a big way by the end of June, MicroStrategy would be forced to write down even the bitcoin it bought just a few days ago.  On Monday, the company said it had bought 13,005 bitcoin for $489 million at an average price of $37,617, including transaction costs. If the current Q2 were to close right now with bitcoin trading at about $29,000, MicroStrategy would need to write that purchase down by about $96 million.  It's not just shareholders who likely aren't happy with Saylor right now. In addition to using cash flow to buy bitcoin, MicroStrategy has sold debt – some of it convertible – to fund its crypto-buying ways. It also recently said it was going to sell shares to buy more bitcoin, though that currency doesn't buy what it did even a week ago. This past Friday, shares of MicroStrategy closed at $647.39 a share. In recent trading, they were at $517.93, down 11.26% on the day. In February they hit a 52-week high of $1,315.  Still, long-time holders know that back in August 2020, when Saylor bought his first bitcoin, the company's shares were less than $200 apiece.

42406686,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hjF,1624369771,"Go West, Bitcoin! Unpacking the Great Hashrate Migration","By now, it should be clear the ""hashrate migration"" is real: Miners are leaving China for good. As of April 2020, an estimated 65% of bitcoin hashrate was domiciled in China; with confirmed bans across the country, that figure will be far lower 12 months from now. The precise magnitude and schedule for the westward move is currently unknown, but all signals seem to be indicating the greatest shakeup in the geographic makeup of bitcoin mining since the start of the industrial mining era.      Hypotheses for the motivations behind China’s move to eliminate mining abound, although no single explanation appears sufficient as of yet. One obvious explanation would be a desire to meet climate targets and reduce emissions. But this is contradicted by China’s continued embrace of coal power (it added three times as much in 2020 as the rest of the world combined) and that the crackdown extended to hydro-powered regions like Sichuan.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    Officially, the justification for the crackdown on “Bitcoin mining and trading behavior” announced in the statement issued by Vice Premier Liu He was to “resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.” If the objective is to curb speculation in cryptocurrency, exchanges would be the more obvious targets. Even though executives at the onshore exchanges Huobi and OKEx do periodically get detained and harassed by the Chinese state, those exchanges are still up and running. And banning mining does little to inhibit Ponzis like PlusToken, which the Chinese state considers to be a source of social instability.      Other analysts have said China sees bitcoin as a competitor to its own digital currency project, the DCEP. But again, bitcoin mining is a largely self-contained industry.      Banning mining does little to inhibit bitcoin transactions or exchanges – they are totally distinct concerns. Transactions can be assembled and included in blocks anywhere. The Chinese crypto industry would work perfectly well even if all mining was domiciled offshore.      Another popular plausible motive for the ban would be continued efforts to stem unmanaged capital outflows. RMB–USDT (tether) markets are probably the most popular crypto-enabled means of offshoring wealth from the mainland. But mining could also be interpreted as a way to convert (capital-control encumbered) local currency into highly mobile global wealth. Buy electricity and ASICs, create hashrate, and receive know your customer (KYC)-free tokens that can be circulated and sold worldwide. At 60% of global hashrate, that’s a potential flow of $8.1 billion a year worth of bitcoin into Chinese miner wallets.    Whether it’s the U.S. or other locales that grow their market share at the expense of China, it will be a significant win for bitcoin’s decentralization.    One alternative explanation that bears noting but has received little discussion so far is the continued integration of the Chinese grid. As China developed its energy resources and became the largest builder of energy infrastructure over the last few decades, it developed an extremely unbalanced grid, with enormous mismatches between supply and demand. China’s scale and varied geography and energy grid meant that extremely abundant energy resources were being produced in remote locations where there simply wasn’t demand for them. In northern provinces like Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, huge amounts of power from coal and wind/solar went unconsumed; and in the southern provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan abundant hydro resources far exceeded local demand.      The major population centers in China are mostly along the southern and eastern coast, thousands of miles away from the most abundant and cheap sources of energy. As a consequence, China became the world’s capital of energy curtailment. As described by Ohm’s law, electricity simply doesn’t travel well at standard voltages and so must be produced relatively close to load centers. When there isn’t local demand for energy, it goes unused.      So in 2016-2017, China was “curtailing” (effectively wasting) extreme amounts of power. In 2017, Chinese curtailment from hydropower reached 55 TWh, a figure equivalent to the entire energy output to the country of Switzerland. In 2016, China curtailed another 52.2 TerraWatt-hour (TWh) of wind and solar. There simply was insufficient local demand to consume this abundance of energy, leading authorities to rethink the grid’s design.      Starting in 2010, China has been constructing an ambitious, continent-spanning ultra-high-voltage power transmission network to transmit power from remote regions with abundant energy to load centers, balancing out the grid. Today, 40,000 kilometers of high-voltage transmission exists, with the longest lines stretching over 3,000 km. Much has been made of the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) DCEP ambitions or general aversion to freedom tech like bitcoin in justifying the mining ban. Less has been said about the fact that the presence of miners in China was always contingent on the availability of stranded energy.      The central and regional government had hitherto tolerated the monetization of excess energy because it simply wasn’t being put to alternative economic use. But as the grid integration and load balancing has improved in the last five years, bitcoin miners have increasingly begun to compete with other industrial and commercial uses. And while sources are hard to find, some analysts have characterized the mining crackdown as part of an anti-corruption campaign targeting regional officials for selling electricity on the black market.      The Inner Mongolia regional guidance also seems to hint at this, making specific reference to “public officials who use their positions to participate in virtual currency 'mining' or provide convenience and protection for them.” Through this lens, the CCP-level crackdown could be interpreted as a reassertion of power relative to officials in far-flung provinces monetizing state resources without permission. The integration of the grid makes the central government much less willing to tolerate the regional monetization of energy, now that miner-driven consumption increasingly rivals other load centers.    By now, we know the crackdown is genuine. Machines are being turned off and hashrate is dippinghttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-drops-hashrate-declines-china-145708972.html. It is still unclear where these newly mobile miners will end up. The U.S. has the second-most capacious grid in the world, and some miners appear optimistic about the opportunities to migrate hashrate west without sustained interruption.  Read more: Nic Carter: El Salvador Doesn’t Need a Bitcoin Mandate    Hardware manufacturer Bitmain advertised at a recent conference for its elite clients an abundance of hosting opportunities in the U.S. While their assumptions about the amount of available hosting power were definitely aggressive, it’s clear Chinese miners are looking westward. Raw electricity cost is no longer the sole consideration. Today, political stability, regulatory clarity and a respect for private property rights are paramount in miner decision-making.      Some hosting services will be able to accommodate the demand by rotating higher-end units from Chinese miners in for older units. Where shelf capacity doesn’t exist, new infrastructure must be built. In the U.S., obtaining the necessary permits can take upwards of six months. Additionally, while some states like Texas (Governor Greg Abbott spoke at the Bitmain conference, warmly welcoming miners to his state) and cities like Jackson, Tennessee and Miami have indicated their openness to miners, others like New York have taken a decidedly hostile approach.      Other more convenient near-term geographies include Kazakhstan, Central Asia and Russia. But whether it’s the U.S. or other locales that grow their market share at the expense of China, it will be a significant win for bitcoin’s decentralization, the stability of mining and bitcoin’s climate impact.

42406702,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAf7hu4,1624368600,State of Crypto: Reflecting on Libra's (Regulatory) Legacy,"Libra was first announced just over two years ago. It may have been one of the most significant projects the crypto industry has seen.    You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Regulatory reminders  The narrative    Facebook announced a grand vision for a stablecoin backed by a handful of currencies just over two years ago today. It killed that vision less than a year later, before rebranding and restructuring the project entirely just six months ago (the new version may launch later this year). But even today we can feel Libra’s impact on global crypto regulation.    Why it matters    Libra was an exciting story to cover. Even though its creators seem to have some second thoughts about how exactly it was revealed to the world, the long-term reaction from regulators in the form of reports and proposed legislation shows how much attention it garnered. The current regulatory approach toward cryptocurrency as a whole stems from that one announcement in mid-2019.    Breaking it down    The other day my colleague Zack Seward pointed out that it has been exactly two years since Facebook announced the blockchain project on which it had spent a year working. The libra stablecoin, as originally envisioned on June 18, 2019, was pretty bold: A digital token backed by a basket of fiat currencies, overseen by a governing association of 100 different companies responsible for both the project’s development as well as its governance.      This project never launched. Seemingly every regulator on the face of the Earth decided this was a bad idea, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke to the U.S. Congress, Facebook blockchain lead David Marcus spoke to Congress (twice), folks around the world called for an immediate halt. Eventually the project rebranded and now aims to launch as a single-fiat stablecoin with assistance from a regulated U.S. bank. (You can find a full timeline here.)      I think my take on Libra aged fairly well. Libra, as proposed, is dead. Diem, its successor, is a radically different project – backed by a single currency (the U.S. dollar) and issued in partnership with a bank. Despite that, I still think this is one of the most significant projects the crypto industry has ever seen, less for what it was and more for what it left behind. Regulators were aware of and discussing cryptocurrencies well before Facebook even poked its nose into blockchain, but the regulatory response took on a decidedly more urgent tone after Libra was announced.      In the two years since, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), a sort of central bank for central banks, has published numerous documents about stablecoins, as have actual central banks. The U.S. President's Working Group on Financial Markets published an advisory last year calling for further stablecoin regulations and addressing retail use and financial stability concerns.      It also may have restarted a lot of the conversation around a central bank digital currency (the folks behind Diem say the stablecoin will be built to become obsolete as soon as a digital dollar is issued). Those discussions, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a world where China is on the verge of pushing its digital yuan fully live and the U.S. is about to publish a report on what its own CBDC could look like.      In fairness, it was mostly Facebook’s involvement that got everyone’s attention. If (no offense) Coinbase or Kraken had proposed this project, I imagine regulators would have shrugged.      Facebook at the time was just a few years out from the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It’s probably fair to say few people really trust the company, particularly when it comes to protecting user data. With libra the company was trying to combine personally identifiable information with actual money.      Moreover, what if Facebook successfully created a closed loop, where people just transact within the libra ecosystem? Or used libra to evade money laundering laws?      These were some of the (I think) biggest questions regulators and policymakers had around this project. And this is despite Facebook’s efforts to publicly divorce itself from the Libra project, including through the governing council, and saying that only its Calibra (now Novi) subsidiary would be directly involved.      But now the seed has been planted and policymakers will be watching for other projects that might pose similar risks to the existing financial system. We’re seeing that in reports on “so-called stablecoins” and “the impact of global stablecoins,” as well as proposed legislation like the STABLE Act.      Looking at the backing, governance and token models, diem is different from what libra was. Whatever diem ultimately becomes, it won’t be what regulators respond to – it’ll be the ghost of what libra could have been.    Biden’s rule  Changing of the guard    By popular demand, this chart will remain intact. That being said, there still hasn’t been much news regarding permanent heads for the CFTC or OCC. U.S. President Joe Biden was overseas for the G7 meeting, though, so perhaps that was expected.

According to Anchorage President Diogo Monica, the firm’s decision to support FLOW was based on “massive demand” from its institutional clients, who are not only interested in investing in FLOW, but also in products being built on the network.      The Flow blockchain was developed in 2019 by Dapper Labs, the company behind the ultra-successful non-fungible token (NFT) platform NBA Top Shot. After running into congestion on Ethereum with its first NFT hit, CryptoKitties, the firm decided to build its own blockchain.      To date, NBA Top Shot has been pretty much the only game in town on Flow, though other projects are starting to emerge.      Monica said support from a federally chartered crypto bank like Anchorage offers protocols like Flow legitimacy in the crowded market, as well as other more tangible benefits.      “There is a lot of other value added here that doesn’t quite come through to the public at large but that exists from us participating in liquidity, providing lending services, providing stable infrastructure, auditing, all these other things,” Monica said.

The increasingly crypto-savvy companies are relative newcomers to crypto VC. While both have invested directly in a handful of crypto startups, joining as limited partners (LPs) means an outside manager will place broader equity investments on their behalf. PayPal confirmed to CoinDesk this is its first such arrangement with a crypto VC firm.      Blockchain Capital is one of older and larger crypto-native venture capital firms with over $1.5 billion under management, General Partner Spencer Bogart told CoinDesk. He said the firm’s fifth fund also received backing from pension funds and university endowments but declined to name additional LPs.      By Bogart’s telling, the payments giants are hungry for bolder investment opportunities across an industry they believe in but need the help of a “field guide” to fully navigate.      “There's nothing better than walking an early-stage startup into the likes of a Visa or PayPal and helping them secure a commercial agreement, and helping make sure that on Visa and PayPal’s side, they have solutions for the products that they want to launch,” he said.

It began deploying capital over 12 months ago but most of its new fund is waiting. (Coinbase, Kraken, Anchorage and OpenSea are previous Blockchain Capital investments.)      The new fund is maintaining a focus on crypto infrastructure plays like startups building to support decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) while avoiding the assets themselves, Bogart said.

The cryptocurrency traded at $29,700 shortly before press time, bringing the year-to-date gain down to just 3%, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The drop comes a day after the People's Bank of China ordered the country's major financial institutions to stop facilitating crypto transactions and signals an end of the four-week-long consolidation between $30,000 and $40,000.      The market looks south with demand-side pressures weakening in the wake of regulatory fears and the Federal Reserve's recent hawkish tilt, analysts told CoinDesk.      “There’s no direct evidence showing people in China are buying the BTC dip. As shown in the ChaiNext tether (USDT) OTC index, the value hovered at 99 for the last few weeks in June, which shows a slight discount in trading USDT,” Matthew Lam, an analyst at crypto exchange OKEx, said.      “There is little evidence of dip demand. People are still sidelined,” Amber Funds said in a Telegram chat.    Bitcoin price drop    Bitcoin peaked above $64,000 in mid-April and fell by 35% in May on the back of concerns regarding the negative environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining and renewed regulatory crackdown in China.      Last week, the Federal Reserve unexpectedly brought forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to 2023, adding to bearish pressures around the cryptocurrency.      While bitcoin is down 8% on a 24-hour basis, other major coins like ether, XRP, and cardano are nursing 10%-20% losses. Dogecoin, the joke cryptocurrency, is trading 25% lower.      As such, bitcoin's dominance rate, or the top cryptocurrency's share in the total market, has hit one-month highs above 47%, per data source TradingView.      Matthew Dibb, COO, and co-founder of Stack Funds, foresees a further rise in bitcoin's dominance rate.      ""I personally think the best trade right now for crypto (regardless of direction) is long bitcoin dominance or short alternative cryptocurrencies against bitcoin,"" Dibb told CoinDesk.      ""If the market falls, bitcoin should fall less than altcoins (we are seeing that recently),"" Dibb said. ""If the sentiment recovers, bitcoin will go up more than altcoins.""        The absence of a quick recovery above $30,000 may bring more chart-driven selling.

42434575,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPiWnh,1624363200,Stronghold Digital Mining Raises $105M to Turn Waste Coal Into Bitcoin,"The fight for clean energy–powered cryptocurrency mining moved forward Tuesday as Stronghold Digital Mining, a digital asset miner powered by alternative energy, announced a $105 million funding round.      The raise comes from two private placements of equity securities, with investors being granted registration rights that require a future public listing, Stronghold told CoinDesk. Investors include MG Capital, various family offices and Greg Beard, a former senior partner at private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Beard is listed as Stronghold’s co-chairman and CEO.      The Pennsylvania company converts waste coal, a material left over from coal mining, into power used to mine bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Defined as a Tier II alternative energy source by state regulators, waste coal is equivalent to hydropower in its environmental impact. The company estimates that for each bitcoin mined, 200 tons of waste coal is eliminated.      ""A negative impact on the environment has long been a criticism of Bitcoin mining, with good reason,” Beard said in a statement, adding:    “Our ownership of the Scrubgrass Plant [in Kennerdell, Pa.] combined with the environmental benefits which accrue to the region allow us to mine bitcoin at what we believe to be some of the lowest costs in the industry while making a transformational contribution to the environment.”    The company describes itself as a “vertically integrated” miner, meaning that in addition to owning its own mining hardware, it also owns a power plant. The setup (minus the waste coal) is reminiscent of mining firm Greenidge Generation in neighboring New York state.    Read more: Greenidge to Merge, Becoming First Publicly Traded Bitcoin Miner With a Power Plant    The bitcoin mining industry’s carbon footprint has come under increased public scrutiny in recent months. In mid-May, Elon Musk announced his company, Tesla, would no longer accept bitcoin as a payment method citing environmental concerns. Musk later said Tesla would resume payments once the mining industry reached 50% clean energy usage.      Earlier this month, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) publicity criticized bitcoin for its negative environmental impact.      In promoting itself as an “ESG-friendly” mining firm, Stronghold seeks to at least complicate the narrative around bitcoin's environmental cost.      ""Coal waste fires have been wreaking havoc in my home state of Pennsylvania for the last hundred years,"" Stronghold co-Chairman Bill Spence said in a statement, adding:    “Simply put, we employ 21st century crypto mining techniques to remediate the impacts of 19th and 20th century coal mining in some of the most environmentally neglected regions of the United States.”",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MINING,Eli Tan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/22/stronghold-digital-mining-raises-105m-to-turn-waste-coal-into-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/deb6d74bf153ff998aeb7b171315b99d880ccc65-1600x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Fireblocks said the lost keys were stored outside its platform.    Crypto staking platform StakeHound filed a lawsuit against Fireblocks at the Tel Aviv District Court on the grounds of alleged negligence, Calcalist reported Tuesday.  A Fireblocks employee allegedly did not protect or back up the private keys to a digital wallet, which were then deleted, preventing StakeHound from accessing its assets.  ""This is a human error committed by an employee of the defendants, who worked in an unsuitable work environment,"" the filing said, according to Calcalist.  ""The defendant irrevocably lost access to the plaintiff’s digital assets, which were deposited in an e-wallet provided by the defendant, causing the loss of 38,178 of the plaintiff's ETH coins,"" equivalent to nearly $72 million at the time of writing.  In a statement on its website, Fireblocks said, ""We are actively investigating the situation and assisting all parties involved to resolve the issue.”  Stakehound was building a Boneh-Lynn-Shacham (BLS) solution, which is not supported by Fireblocks’ multi-party computation (MPC) framework, Fireblocks said.  Fireblocks said it had no contractual obligation to store or back up BLS keys for Stakehound.  ""The keys were generated by the clients and stored outside the Fireblocks platform,"" Fireblocks said. ""No Fireblocks production keys were ever affected, all Fireblocks' customers' funds are safe, and customer keys are backed up and recoverable.""  Fireblocks requires customers to engage the disaster-recovery services of a third-party service provider or to independently back up their keys, something it said Stakehound didn’t do.  Fireblocks said in its statement that it urged Stakehound ""numerous times"" to back up BLS keys with a third-party provider, and discovered in April that it had not done so.

India's tax department is looking into whether a 2% equalization levy applies to crypto assets, the Economic Times reported Monday, citing people with knowledge of the matter.  The levy – also known as the ""Google tax"" – imposes the charge on services provided in India by overseas e-commerce companies.  Experts have speculated whether this could apply to crypto exchanges.  ""The way the new equalization levy is worded and defined, it appears that it will also be applicable on cryptocurrency bought from an exchange not based in India,"" Girish Vanvari, the founder of tax-advisory firm Transaction Square, told the ET.  The levy would apply to the selling price and, therefore, exchanges may need to add it to the cost of the assets, he said.  Nevertheless, it may be difficult for the government to impose the levy in the absence of a regulatory framework for the treatment of crypto assets, according to Amit Maheshwari, a partner at tax-consulting firm AKM Global.  “In the absence of any guidelines on the treatment of crypto assets, there is ambiguity in how these would be treated under the tax laws and FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act),"" he said.  Legislation has been in the works in recent months to ban crypto outright in India. However, there were signs earlier this month that the government would take a more lenient approach and classify bitcoin as an asset class and have the crypto sector regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board.

""Historically, whenever retail starts going short like this, the market has tended to find it hard to perpetuate the downtrend.""      The firm pointed to the recent negative funding rate in perpetual futures listed on FTX, Deribit, and BitMEX as evidence of retailers' short bias. The funding rate is the cost of holding long/short positions. A negative print implies that many traders are bearish, or holding short positions.      Bitcoin bottomed out in the first quarter of 2019 with negative funding rates, and rallied sharply in the following three months. Negative rates observed after the March 2020 crash and in third-quarter 2020 also marked price bottoms.      QCP's preferred trade remains a short strangle – an option strategy aimed at benefiting from consolidation/impending drop in price volatility. It involves selling the same expiry call and put options at strikes equidistant from the spot market price.      According to Amber Group, some investors have been selling puts below $30,000 – a sign they are expecting the key support to hold. Selling options or strategies like short strangle are quite risky and better left to big firms and institutions with ample capital supply.      Others are less sanguine, with Stack Funds saying the cryptocurrency could drop below $30,000.      ""We are still witnessing moderate incoming flows from family office and high net worth individuals, however, the demand has slightly dampened since May,"" COO and co-founder of Stack Funds Matthew Dibb said. ""Given the recent price action, we expect that bitcoin will likely break $30,000 in the short term, while still increasing in market-cap dominance.""      Crypto finance services provider Amber Funds and OKEx exchange also considered the slowdown in demand.      ""There's no direct evidence showing people in China are buying the BTC dip. As shown in the ChaiNext tether (USDT) OTC index, the value hovered at 99 for the last few weeks in June, which shows a slight discount in trading USDT,"" Matthew Lam, an analyst at crypto exchange OKEx, said.      ""There is little evidence of dip demand. People are still sidelined,"" Amber Funds said in a Telegram chat.      With the demand side weak, sellers may succeed in pushing the cryptocurrency down on the back of consistent negative regulatory news flow out of China.      Dibb said charts also appear bearish. The daily chart MACD histogram, an indicator used to gauge trend strength and trend changes, has fallen below zero, signaling an end to the consolidation and potential for a fresh sell-off.      ""The cryptocurrency needs to reclaim $40,000 for any meaningful recovery,"" OKEx's Lam said.

The sister network of Polkadot's main DeFi project Acala, Karura raised more than 500,000 Kusama tokens (KSM) from its community, or about $100 million at current prices.  ""More than 15,000 network stakeholders locked up KSM in favor of Karura being added to yours truly,"" the Kusama network tweeted Tuesday.  Karura is a token-trading application that allows users to build scalable DeFi applications without large transaction fees.  The auction win secures Karura a 48-week lease to build on Kusama, Polkadot's pre-production environment, known as a canary network.  Networks like Polkadot, Cosmos and Solana are providing developers with a way to avoid the increasing cost and congestion on Ethereum that has come with the explosion in the DeFi market.  A 48-week lease on Kusama – which shares much of the same code as Polkadot but allows for more experimentation and faster upgrades – is therefore a highly sought-after proposition, albeit an expensive one.

In March of this year, MoonPay hired former Coinbase UK CEO Zeeshan Feroz as its chief growth officer.      “The two companies combined are actually a force to be reckoned with,” Feroz told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:    “MoonPay does that last mile of everything a business needs, and BCB sits behind that in terms of the payments and banking rails. Bringing the two businesses closer together, we could align a growth strategy that naturally benefits both businesses.”    BCB will continue to focus on the heavy lifting of banking infrastructure, while MoonPay brings expertise in highly scalable crypto-native payments processing, said BCB Group CEO Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie.

42434574,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPiWlh,1624348800,A16z Joins Forces With Deutsche Telekom in Staking CELO Tokens,"Deutsche Telekom, one of Europe’s leading telecommunications firms, is joining forces with VC giant Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) to help secure the mobile-first Celo payments network.      The move further cements the telco’s adventurous stance on participating in next-generation blockchains.      Announced Tuesday, T-Systems MMS, the digital innovation arm of Deutsche Telekom, is now staking its own “significant” investment in CELO tokens, plus a further delegated trove of tokens belonging to a16z. The VC firm invested in Celo in major rounds in both 2019 and 2021.+      Becoming both a backer and a proof-of-stake (PoS) infrastructure provider to Celo adds to the supporting roles T-Systems brings to the Flow blockchain, as well as decentralized finance (DeFi) data oracle service Chainlink.    Read more: Chainlink Supporter Deutsche Telekom Has Quietly Started Staking on Blockchains    T-Systems MMS blockchain lead Andreas Dittrich says staking on Celo is “more of the same.”      What’s really exciting, he said, is building use cases on top of these networks. An obvious first opportunity is around peer-to-peer payments because Celo is designed for open mobile transactions with extremely low fees and no intermediaries. T-Systems is Europe’s largest telecommunications company by revenue.      “I think [Celo] is insanely easy to onboard users, to bank users if you want. Obviously, this is not as interesting if you already have a PayPal account and many credit cards or whatever,” Dittrich told CoinDesk in an interview, adding:    “But think about young people just joining the financial system in developing countries, Southeast Asian countries, for example, where peer-to-peer payments is a huge deal; think about things like remittances and sending data internationally, without relying on Western Union, which has terrible fees.”  Read more: Libra Minus Facebook: Why Celo Is 2020’s Buzzy Token Project    While Deutsche Telekom is a big player with access to millions of users, when it comes to offering these types of decentralized services to a community the telco’s role should be merely as an enabler, said Dittrich, and as open as possible.      In other words, a very different approach from something like Samsung’s “golden castle,” where wallets and functionality are provided but you have to stay within the Samsung ecosystem, he said.      “Our approach has always been different,” Dittrich said. “We are just your enabler. Because this is what I think telcos should be. We should just enable whatever you want to do. We shouldn't hinder you for the sake of profit. Everyone profits in this case, and this has always been our vision.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | FIAT | LINK | FLOW,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/06/22/a16z-joins-forces-with-deutsche-telekom-in-staking-celo-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0674f7845a9147537b5606139537669352295cb4-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report on Tuesday by Spain's second-largest newspaper, El Mundo, Jaime Guevara of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMNL) has joined a group of citizens to oppose the law.      FMNL is one of the country's two major political parties, and Guevara is the deputy of Morazán, a province in the country's northeast.      Oscar Artero, a citizen plaintiff accompanying Guevara, said the lawsuit was brought because the law signed by President Nayib Bukele failed to consider the harmful effects on his country.      On June 8, the country's legislature passed a law by a supermajority making bitcoin legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar. El Salvador is the first country to make the crypto an official currency.      ""The bitcoin law is to loot people's pockets, it is tax-exempt,"" Artero said during a press conference. ""They want to force us to trade.""      The case will be heard by the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, the country's top judicial branch.      Bukele's party ousted five Supreme Court judges last month for their ruling on COVID-19 measures, a move that was widely condemned. They were immediately replaced by new magistrates.

Harris Jr., who is better known by his stage name ""T.I.,"" and business partner Ryan Felton were accused of violating securities law for selling unregistered FLiK tokens to investors in 2017.      Court documents filed on Monday in the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals show the decisions made by circuit judge William Pryor, district judge Emily Coody Marks and chief judge Robert J. Luck upheld a decision by a lower court to dismiss the complaint, because it was filed beyond the limitations period.      Investor Kenneth Fedance, who purchased $3,000 worth of FLiK, sued Harris Jr. and Felton in 2019 in the U.S. Northern District Court of Georgia, accusing them of three securities violations.      ""Because we affirm the dismissal of the complaint as untimely, we do not reach Harris’s alternative arguments for affirmance, or Felton’s attempt to adopt them,"" the appellate judges wrote.      Felton created FLiK the same year he began marketing his company's tokens and solicited Harris Jr. as its co-founder shortly after. Harris' contacts, including actor Kevin Hart, took to Twitter to promote the project and its tokens, according to the document.      “I’m Super Excited for [T.I.] and his new venture with @TheFlikIO! They’re gonna crush it! #ICO #blockchain #crypto #bitcoin,” Hart wrote at the time.      The tokens formed part of purported digital streaming platform FLiK's ecosystem, which was marketed as an “online viewing platform that [allows] creatives to sell/rent their projects.”      In a separate matter last year, the pair, alongside six other individuals, were accused of promoting the platform's initial coin offering without first registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).      The rapper agreed to pay $75,000 and not participate in any digital asset sales until 2025.

42434577,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyPiWph,1624321604,Roc-A-Fella Records Sues Co-Founder for Trying to Sell Jay-Z’s Debut Album as an NFT,"Roc-A-Fella Records – the record label started by Jay-Z, Damon Dash and Kareem Burke in 1995 – is suing Dash for allegedly trying to sell the copyright to Jay-Z’s debut album, ""Reasonable Doubt.""      According to the complaint, Dash doesn’t own ""Reasonable Doubt.""Rather, Roc-a-Fella does. Because Dash owns only one-third of the record label, the suit alleges that the copyright to ""Reasonable Doubt"" was not his to sell.      Dash’s auction in partnership with the non-fungible token (NFT) platform SuperFarm was scheduled to run from Wednesday through Friday, but was cancelled after Roc-A-Fella’s lawyers sent letters to both Dash and SuperFarm. And yet the complaint alleges that Dash is still “frantically scouting for another venue to make the sale” – and may have already minted an NFT.      The NFT market for digital collectibles from musical artists and star athletes is booming, and many celebrities are savvy investors and crypto enthusiasts themselves. In February, Jay-Z and Jack Dorsey, the billionaire founder of Square and Twitter, donated 500 bitcoin to launch a development fund focused on increasing crypto adoption in Africa and India.      In March, Square bought Jay-Z’s music streaming service, Tidal, and NFT market experts speculated that NFTs might be the reason behind Dorsey’s investment. Though the NFT market might still be a crypto Wild West, the suit indicates that celebrities like Jay-Z are learning fast enough to avoid being taken advantage of.      In a comment provided to TMZ, Dash denied trying to sell ""Reasonable Doubt."" Instead, he claimed he was only trying to sell his stake in Roc-A-Fella. Dash told TMZ that Jay-Z offered to buy him out in March but he found the offer “unacceptable.”    Read more: NFTs of Hip-Hop Icons Hit NEAR Blockchain to Mark Juneteenth",NEGATIVE,NEAR,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | NEAR,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/06/22/roc-a-fella-records-sues-co-founder-for-trying-to-sell-jay-zs-debut-album-as-an-nft,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/26b46775511f9d333b68a9ad983d0250b4c04d1c-1000x655.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
