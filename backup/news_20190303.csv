42381663,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrkv,1551610835,The Right Way to Do Blockchain Consortiums,"Randy Wilson is a partner in Digital Risk at Deloitte.    ——————    2019 will be the year the rubber meets the road for blockchain consortia.  If 2017 was a buzzy time that saw a number of successful proofs-of-concept launch, 2018 was a more sedate period when the lawyers got together to develop the framework under which consortia could operate. However, 2019 will be the year that these platforms go live and expand across commodities, processes, markets and geographies.  By now, the benefits of the technology have been demonstrated; the next step is to make this technology work at scale, that is, to build the shared platform that addresses industry challenges, benefits the majority of market participants and convinces the transacting ecosystem to embark on the journey.  The consortium model  The preferred vehicle for launching enterprise-grade blockchain platforms is the consortium.  The idea is simple: If we as a group have enough volume and can drive sufficient liquidity across our platform, the rest of the market will join and transact. Market participants working with their peers have an edge over tech start-ups when it comes to creating a common approach and driving adoption of the platform.  The formation of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) provided a replicable example: a leading group of companies and banks came together to create a common derivative platform and the initial investors retained ownership over it.  Now the model is being re-applied across the value chain in the energy sector and beyond. First movers that can bring enough volume onto their blockchain platform will eventually compel the entire market to adopt their technology. The tipping point is estimated to be around 70 percent.  If you can get that share of entities to do business on the platform, the remainder of the market will have no choice but to follow. But time is of the essence: attract only 25-30 percent of the market and you will be stuck serving a fragmented group of clients with little chance of creating attractive positive returns. We have seen many shared industry platforms featuring other technologies suffer this fate.  Near-term growth is still quite challenging even if a platform launches successfully. Large companies have concerns about the enterprise readiness of blockchain technologies and are hesitant to commit live transactions to the platform.  Many want other consortium members to go first so they can identify and remediate significant risks. It is difficult to get a platform going if members adopt such a ‘wait and see’ approach.  Attracting non-members to use the platform can be a challenge. There is usually very high interest at the start of a consortium from parties outside the initial investor group, who also want to get in with some skin. The original investors like the added trade volumes the outsiders bring, but not necessarily seeing their share in the entity diluted. This can result in a serious stalemate. Why would a non-member help a competitor create a platform if they are not adequately compensated for involvement?  The answer is: if they are forced to use the platform because the rest of the industry has adopted it as the place to trade. This must be managed carefully. Failure to do so could encourage outsiders to form a competing consortium. The last thing anyone wants is the emergence of 10 or more rival platforms.  Evolving the model  Two of the most common business models for consortia-led blockchain ventures are as non-profit or for-profit entities. The non-profit approach is most often focused on an industry challenge that has a significant social impact. Such entities often operate as opensource projects and have public or third-sector involvement. The for-profit model is used where development is private sector-driven and where there is the promise of an exceptional medium-term valuation as seen in many supply chain-related ventures.  But another model exists that can encourage broad market participation, and also provide initial investors with a means for creating and recouping value around the platform. The traditional utility model remains relatively unexplored when it comes to blockchain ventures and may hold special promise here – not as the solution, but as part of a hybrid model.  In this model, a consortium first provides basic capabilities – network consensus, transaction distribution and verification, basic smart contract templates, tokenized assets, digital documents, among others – as a kind of utility. Usage fees are established using a cost-based model, and any excess revenue is distributed back to all market participants based on some measure of use, such as volume/value channelled through the platform.  This addresses the issue of founding members having too preferential a position relative to other participants. The consortium can then focus, through a second legal entity, on establishing the second-order benefits unlocked through wider adoption and effective use of the base layer.  Here the opportunity is to create market-specific solutions that harness the core capabilities and further embed the specialist user interfaces, business rules, process flows and data analysis dashboards needed by particular groups of participants. In such a scenario, the core platform could even be opened to rival consortia who would also stand to gain from developing on a common underlying platform.  Wait – did we just invent public blockchain? Well not quite, not yet at least. For some considerable time to come it will remain necessary for consortia groups to maintain a level of control over the operation, accessibility, security and performance of new networks.  The role of data  Energy companies are now cognisant of the value of the data they create. Just as consumers have much greater awareness that the data they provide has value, so too do organizations.  A successful blockchain platform will eventually secure a rich, validated set of transactional data unmatched anywhere else within the industry and it will enable market participants to be firmly in control of when with whom, and how much they share. Those companies will insist that any value received for data originating within their organization and used by some entity in the future flows largely back to the source.  The platform’s role in managing reference data (the countless registers of facilities, ports, vessels, routes, products, deal specifications, procedural documents and even contractual templates) can also provide very real industry value. Many companies would pay a platform provider for access to reference data if they trusted the completeness and reliability of the source.  Recommendations  Several lessons can be learned from the formation of blockchain consortia to date that can be used by other potential adopters, and the most important are around the structure and strategic alignment.  Create a new legal entity structure to deliver your blockchain solution. Separate standalone legal entities allow large industry players to jointly invest in an innovative environment, protects their interests and provides the right level of operational flexibility. The trick is to address the risks involved with investing in a consortium, but not constrain its ability to make decisions effectively.  Structure to maximize adoption, not profit. The goal is to encourage adoption and participation outside of the core members. Models that give too much profit to too few members have struggled and many have failed.  Form an independent board. The board must transition from individual members actively involved in setting up the new entity to those who can focus on the longer-term strategy. It is important to move from a project steering group to an independent board.  The key is to find the right model that adequately protects the interests of the investors, encourages adoption and also promotes the flexibility and innovative spirit essential for a successful start-up. A consortium is a group with a shared goal and it is crucial to be smart about creating a structure that gives the members the best chance of making the right trade-offs.

42381661,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9nrnR,1551607254,Ethereum Foundation Director Sets New Vision for Blockchain Non-Profit,"“When the Ethereum Foundation was founded, the Ethereum Foundation was ethereum. People in the Foundation were the ones that were building ethereum. Now, that’s not the case.”  That’s Aya Miyaguchi, executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, the non-profit organization founded and dedicated to the continuing development of the world's second-largest blockchain by total value.  Since Miyaguchi’s appointment in early 2018, however, the ethereum platform has faced severe market turmoil, with the price of the blockchain’s native cryptocurrency, ether, dropping from a high of roughly $1,100 in early 2018 to roughly $130 today. Further, it's seen rising competition in the form of new blockchains touting more advanced smart contracts and more sustainable decentralized application infrastructures.  Still, Miyaguchi tells CoinDesk that, in her view, the important change over that time as it relates to the role of the Ethereum Foundation is not ether's fluctuating price or the shifting market for blockchain infrastructure, but rather ethereum's growing community of global developers.  “With the nature of open-source technology, [ethereum] has changed over the years and the entire ecosystem has grown a lot bigger,” said Miyaguchi.  Giving a short address at the opening of the second annual ethereum hackathon, ETHDenver, Miyaguchi highlighted her desire to see that the Ethereum Foundation does not remain stagnant, hinting at what could be considered a redefined mission for one of the industry's oldest non-profits.  “I believe the role of the Ethereum Foundation also needs to shift … What are things that only the Ethereum Foundation can do?” asked Miyaguchi to the crowd of ethereum developers and enthusiasts.  As the earliest non-profit organization to promote and invest in ethereum, Miyaguchi said that one of the foundation’s greatest strengths was its trusted brand.  She told CoinDesk:  “I believe the Ethereum Foundation has established this trust relationship in the world where we do have the brand. People trust us to be neutral or honest about information so we just want to deliver the true information.”  Miyaguchi aims to lead the organization to focus more heavily this year on improved communications to the general public about the progress and development of the ethereum platform.  “Someone needs to fill in this role,” insisted Miyaguchi. “Who can do this better than others? Not that we’re experts in doing this, it’s more like our position being a non-profit and being neutral [means] we don’t have any business incentives.”  'Supporting and coordination work'  As such, Miyaguchi concedes the Foundation is no longer the central hub it used to be for ethereum developers, research projects and technology development. Yet, she argues the Ethereum Foundation still has a role to play in communicating to, as well as, coordinating work between different ethereum startups and projects.  “I think that even the supporting and coordination work is still a reason for why the Ethereum Foundation should exist,” affirmed Miyaguchi to CoinDesk.  As Miyaguchi points out, an area of increased coordination she’d like to see this year is with the grants program non-profit administers.  Having recently seen its fifth wave of grantees, seven different projects were awarded an undisclosed amount of funds to address “urgent, important and unique improvements which further the ethereum vision,” as stated in Thursday’s blog post.  But according to Miyaguchi, the grants program for a long-time running hasn’t been strictly organized by Ethereum Foundation members, nor does she envision it as a strictly Ethereum Foundation initiative.  “The grants process is being improved and one of the things I mentioned is we’re involving other community members to assess projects that apply,” explained Miyaguchi. “We have some foundation members, but some members from the community who are part of the grant process.”  Miyaguchi highlighted that the grants program presently was looking at potential partnerships with other startups in the ethereum ecosystem such as venture capital studio Consensys to co-fund the program.  “There’s a lot of [potential for] collaboration since ConsenSys is bigger than us and they have a lot of resources,” said Miyaguchi to CoinDesk.  ConsenSys, which has its own company-specific grants program, announced at ETHDenver the acceptance of new applicants to whom it will seek to give over $500,000.  Though the award amounts given away to Ethereum Foundation grantees this year was not specified, the fourth wave of grantees last October received collectively over $3 million in funding support.  What others are saying  Outside of funding, the Ethereum Foundation was once the focal point for ethereum developers to explore, discuss and ultimately implement blockchain protocol design changes as necessary.  But as highlighted by Hudson Jameson – community relations manager for the organization – its role in regards to decision-making about ethereum protocol changes has taken “a very important step towards further decentralization.”  “They haven’t taken their eye off of the ecosystem … However, they are less involved in direct decision-making of the ecosystem,” said Jameson to CoinDesk.  Jameson highlighted the role the protocol's creator Vitalik Buterin as proof of this transition, stating “[Vitalik] is definitely still a voice that holds a lot of weight in the ecosystem … [but] his influence has decreased over time by necessity in order to have the community [itself] make more direct decisions.”  Miyaguchi couldn’t agree more. Noting that the very definition of an ethereum “core developer” is naturally changing because “it really is not only Ethereum Foundation people who are building [ethereum,]” Miyaguchi told CoinDesk.  She said:  “Our definition of success is not the success of the Ethereum Foundation. If ultimately the Ethereum Foundation getting smaller is best for the ethereum ecosystem, we are happy with it.”  At the same time, this transition has caused some degree of concern from those within the ethereum community over how exactly decision-making should now progress.  Speaking at an ETHDenver panel about blockchain governance, Jameson, Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir and Ethereum Foundation developer Piper Merriam all agreed the present hybrid form of decision-making about the ethereum protocol was not sustainable.  “I don’t think blockchain governance is like [any] open-source governance we’ve seen before … Is the structure that [ethereum] already has sustainable? I think the answer is no,” said Zamfir during the panel.  Remaining optimistic about the present ""opaque"" form of governance on ethereum, Merriam added that he is ""confident in that group of [core developers] to contribute at least for a while to make reasonable decisions [about the blockchain protocol.]""  On this front, Miyaguchi contends the path forward when it comes to decision-making on an irrefutably global blockchain like ethereum today consists of not just ""one, two or three voices"" but many.  Miyaguchi concluded:  ""Our job is to coordinate but the actual decision-making is not. It can be done by our members. They can be part of it but not all of it.""
