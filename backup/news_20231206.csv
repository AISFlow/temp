21132323,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=560083,1701907178,"What Is Web3 Technology? Guide: Meaning, Key Projects And How To Invest","The path from the Bitcoin whitepaper to the bustling ecosystem of Web3 technology has been nothing short of revolutionary. In this guide, we trace the evolution of digital currencies as they pave the way for the Web3 frontier—a new internet paradigm underpinned by blockchain technology and decentralized ideals. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Web3 technology. We’ll delve into the web3 meaning, web3 projects, web3 domains, explore its foundational concepts, and examine how to invest in web3. As we unpack the essence of Web3, we’ll reveal why it’s not just a technological leap, but also a cultural and economic revolution, poised to reshape the internet as we know it. Introduction To Web3 Technology In the rapidly evolving landscape of the digital world, Web3 technology emerges as a groundbreaking paradigm shift, redefining how we interact with the internet. Rooted in the principles of decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment, it represents a significant leap from the traditional, centralized web—often referred to as Web2. At the core of Web3 lies blockchain technology, the same innovative force that brought cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin into the limelight. However, it extends far beyond just digital currencies. It encompasses a wide array of decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and a new generation of internet services and platforms that operate autonomously and are not controlled by any single entity. Web3 Meaning: A Comprehensive Guide The web3 meaning captures the essence of a decentralized online ecosystem underpinned by blockchain technology. It is an umbrella term that encapsulates an internet where users have sovereign control over their data, identities, and transactions. This vision for the next web generation stands on the pillars of decentralization, openness, and greater user utility. Unlike its predecessors, Web3 facilitates a user-centric internet, harnessing the principles of cryptocurrency economics, collective governance, and immutable records. Within ‘what is web3 technology’, we find the blueprint for a participative and interoperable web, where the networks are maintained by the users themselves rather than by tech conglomerates. Furthermore, the web3 definition extends to include not just the structural and functional changes but also the philosophical shift towards a self-governing, resilient, and equitable digital space. Web3 Definition Web3 is defined as the third generation of the internet, characterized by decentralized networks that utilize blockchain technology and token-based economics. It’s a shift from consuming content to owning and contributing to the network’s assets and operations. This succinct web3 definition encompasses a future where the internet operates autonomously, enabled by distributed ledger technology, and is free from the control of centralized authorities. The Evolution from Web1 To Web2 To Web3.0 The digital world has undergone a significant transformation from Web1 to Web2, and now to Web3.0, each phase marking a pivotal shift in how the internet is structured and utilized. This evolution can be seen as a journey from static web pages to interactive experiences, and finally to a decentralized, user-driven web. Web1 Meaning Web1, often referred to as the ‘Static Web,’ was the internet’s first iteration. It was characterized by static websites that were purely informational and offered limited interaction. During this era, content was created by a small group of producers and consumed by the users, who had no direct way to contribute or alter the information. The key aspect of Web1 was its simplicity and ease of access to information, laying the foundation for the more interactive web that followed. Web2 Meaning Web2, also known as the ‘Social Web,’ revolutionized the internet by introducing interactivity, social networking, and user-generated content. This era saw the rise of platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter, where users not only consumed content but also contributed to it, creating a more dynamic and collaborative web experience. The shift to Web2 brought about significant changes in how people connect, share, and communicate online, paving the way for a more connected global community. Web3 Meaning Web3.0, or simply Web3, represents the next phase in the evolution of the internet. This iteration is defined by its decentralized nature, leveraging blockchain technology and token-based economics. It’s a paradigm shift from the centralized platforms of Web2, giving users unprecedented control over their data and online interactions. Web3:// is a concept that exemplifies this change, indicating a move towards a more secure, private, and user-empowered web. Web3 introduces concepts like decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), signaling a significant leap towards a more open, transparent, and equitable internet. Web3 Explained: Beyond The Basics Delving deeper into the realm of Web3, it’s crucial to move beyond the basics and understand the intricate mechanisms that define this new digital epoch. It’s about a transformative shift in how we perceive and interact with the web—a shift toward a more decentralized, transparent, and user-centric online world. How Web3.0 Is Changing The Internet Landscape Web3.0, often simply referred to as Web3, is dramatically altering the internet landscape. This transformation stems from its decentralized nature, distributing power and control across the network instead of centralizing it in the hands of a few dominant players. This shift in control signifies not just a technological change but a fundamental shift in digital power dynamics. It ushers in an era of increased privacy, enhanced security, and greater user sovereignty, making the internet a more equitable and participatory space. It’s an exciting time, as Web3 opens up new possibilities for creative and economic freedom online. Moreover, it also has the potential to fundamentally disrupt the Web2 business models of platforms like Facebook. Disrupting Traditional Business Models Web3’s approach to data ownership and user empowerment directly threatens the established Web2 models. In the Web2 ecosystem, typified by platforms like Facebook, user data is a commodity. These platforms collect and monetize user information through targeted advertising, creating revenue streams heavily reliant on user data. Web3, however, introduces a paradigm where users have full control over their data. Through blockchain technology, Web3 enables individuals to own and monetize their data, participate in governance, and directly benefit from their contributions to the network. This shift in data ownership and control represents a seismic shift in how online business models function. For instance, in a Web3-based social media platform, users could earn tokens for their content, engagement, and community contributions. These tokens could represent actual stake in the platform, giving users not just a say in how the platform evolves, but also a share in the economic benefits. This model starkly contrasts with Web2 platforms, where user activity generates value that primarily benefits the platform owners. It’s model of shared ownership and profits poses a significant threat to the traditional ad-revenue-driven models of Web2 companies. Impact On Established Tech Giants Let’s consider a hypothetical scenario where a major platform like Facebook faces a Web3 competitor. In this scenario, the Web3 platform empowers users with control over their data, allowing them to opt into advertising schemes voluntarily and transparently. Users could even earn a share of the advertising revenue generated by their data. This transparency and profit-sharing model could attract users away from traditional platforms, compelling companies like Facebook to rethink their data and revenue strategies. Moreover, the application of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) introduces a governance model that is more democratic and user-influenced. Users of a DAO-driven platform can propose, vote on, and implement changes to the platform, directly influencing its direction and policies. This level of user involvement and control is unprecedented in the Web2 landscape and could lead to a more user-centric and ethical online platform. Web3 Is Going Great: Explained The phrase “Web3 Is Going Great” refers to a website by Molly White, a crypto researcher & critic, software engineer, Wikipedian which is called “Web3 is Going Just Great”. White’s website serves as a critical ledger, chronicling the various scams and fraudulent activities within the crypto and Web3 space. As of November 2023, the site’s ‘Grift Counter’ has tallied a staggering $69.52 billion in financial losses due to these nefarious activities. Some of the latest examples of frauds covered on the “Web3 Is Going Great” site include: Monero Community Crowdfunding Wallet Drained: Monero, focused on privacy, encountered a significant setback when its community crowdfunding system (CCS) was compromised and entirely drained, losing about 2675.73 XMR (approximately $460,000), funded by donations. Safemoon Executives Charged For Fraud: The executives behind Safemoon, a crypto token which had its all time high market cap in April 2021 with $17 billion, were charged with defrauding investors. They promised a secure investment but engaged in practices like removing tokens from the liquidity pool, leading to significant financial losses for investors. Infringement Lawsuit In The NFT Space: A notable case in the NFT realm involved Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen, who were ordered to pay $1.6 million in a lawsuit over creating identical NFTs to the Bored Ape collection. Key Web3 Projects And Innovations Web3 is fostering a multitude of innovative projects across various domains. These platforms stand out, revolutionizing traditional financial systems with decentralized lending, borrowing, and trading. Similarly, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) offer a new model for organizational governance using blockchain technology. Gaming and NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are also significant sectors. Play-to-earn gaming models have emerged, where players can earn cryptocurrency or NFTs through gameplay. These games often incorporate blockchain to ensure true ownership of in-game assets. Moreover, Web3 is also seeing growth in decentralized social media platforms, where users have control over their data and can earn from their online interactions. These platforms challenge the centralized model of current social media giants by offering more privacy and reducing dependency on advertising revenue models. Another niche is domain services. Spotlight On Prominent Projects In the vast and varied landscape, certain projects stand out for their innovative contributions and foundational roles in shaping the future of decentralized technology.

21130750,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564150,1701903625,Bitcoin Bullish Fractal Returns: Analyst Predicts Another Leg-Up With Price Target,"The recent Bitcoin rally has brought a number of things to the forefront and one of those is a bullish Bitcoin fractal that has not returned in two years. Crypto analyst FieryTrading was the one to point this out in a recent analysis of the leading cryptocurrency as something that could serve as evidence that the rally will continue. Bitcoin Bullish Fractal Makes A Comeback The crypto analyst pointed to a previously identified channel in the Bitcoin price that could suggest a bullish continuation. This channel often results after a big pump and given that BTC has added around $15,000 to its price in the space of a month, it doesn’t get bigger than this. As a result of this, the channel has returned, suggesting that the BTC price could stick to this historical fractal. Related Reading: 8 Green Candles: Here’s What Happened To Bitcoin The Last Time It Appeared FieryTrading identified that the fractal had appeared back in 2019 when the price jumped from around $4,100 to $5,800. After this, the fractal had completed the move, causing the BTC price to rise above the $6,800 level. Source: Tradingview.com Then again in 2020, the fractal would reappear after the BTC price rose from around $11,000 and ended around $14,200. And just like in 2019, when the fractal was confirmed, it saw a continuation of the bullish rally which pushed the Bitcoin price above $16,000. Most recently, after Bitcoin’s price rose from $28,000 to $41,000, the fractal has reappeared once more. “The pattern that I’m talking about is a bullish channel after a big pump that results in another big pump,” FieryTrading explains. BTC price mounts recovery | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Where Does This Put BTC’s Price? Following the previous performances of the Bitcoin price whenever this fractal has appeared, it suggests that there is still a lot of runway for the current rally. The crypto analyst used this historical performance to map out a likely path for the crypto’s price, putting the top of the fractal at $48,000.

One week later, and BTC has successfully broken out of the channel, as predicted by this fractal analysis,” FieryTrading stated. “As described in my analysis below, I’m currently looking at 48k as the next target. Seeing how these fractals historically behaved, 48k should be fairly easily reached?” If this fractal does play out the way the analyst expects, then the BTC price can be expected to add another $6,000 to its value from here before the recovery trend ends. This means that the leading crypto might see another 10% jump from its current price.

Federal Judge Richard Jones, of the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, accepted the plea on Wednesday, just over two weeks after Zhao and Binance, the exchange he founded, pleaded guilty to various violations tied to poor anti-money laundering practices at the world's largest crypto exchange. Zhao stepped down from his role as CEO of the exchange as part of the guilty pleas.  ""This Court, having considered the Report and Recommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge, to which there has been no timely objection ... hereby accepts the plea of guilty of the defendant ... the defendant is adjudged guilty of such offense,"" the judge wrote. ""All parties shall appear before this Court for sentencing as directed.""  Sentencing is currently scheduled for Feb. 23, 2024. Zhao has been released on bond ahead of that date, though prosecutors have asked that he be required to stay in the U.S. through sentencing. The Binance founder's attorneys have argued that Zhao is not a flight risk, and should be allowed to return to the UAE, where his family is, until February.  Under the current terms of his bond release, Zhao would be allowed to go back, but must return to the U.S. two weeks prior to sentencing. Judge Jones stayed that part of Zhao's release last week until he can make a final ruling on the matter, requiring him to stay in the country for the moment.  Binance, which pleaded guilty to three charges, including one sanctions-related charge, has to allow monitors who can report back to the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department as part of its plea deal, which also saw it agree to pay a massive $4.3 billion fine.

21129164,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564258,1701900008,"Bitcoin “Supercycle” Began At $15,000: BTC Bulls Targeting $9 Million In 2 Years","According to @RiggsBTC on X, Bitcoin (BTC) is poised for an “unprecedented” surge that could lift it to above $9 million in the next two years. Taking to X on December 6, @RiggsBTC asserted that the current Bitcoin bull run, which began in late 2022 when prices dumped to as low as $15,000, marks the start of a “supercycle,” a period where BTC will aggressively rally, extending gains. Will Bitcoin Hit $9 Million In 2 Years? The asset manager attributes this potential upsurge to multiple factors. Top of the list is the looming supply shock, considering the expected Bitcoin halving scheduled for early April 2021. @RiggsBTC noted that with less than 21 million BTC in circulation, reducing supply and sustained demand could support Bitcoin, feeding aggressive bulls. Related Reading: Coinbase Introduces New Features For Global Remittances To contextualize the potential magnitude of this expected growth, @RiggsBTC estimates that only if 5% of global wealth, conservatively estimated at over $1 quadrillion, translating to $50 trillion, get exposure to the limited BTC in circulation, there will be more upsides. From the analyst’s view, there will only be around 5 million BTC, most of which are from “weak hands” selling to “nation-states and institutions.” This shift will be the basis for a leg up that will see Bitcoin reach $9 million “in 24 months.” Pierre Rochard, the VP of Research at Riot Platforms, echoed @RiggsBTC’s sentiment, highlighting the favorable macroeconomic conditions likely to propel Bitcoin even higher. Rochard notes that the U.S. government spends $6 trillion, encompassing $4 trillion in taxes, $2 trillion in borrowing, and $1 trillion in interest payments on its $33 trillion debt. While the government spends huge sums of money on interest payments alone, Bitcoin’s market capitalization remains under $1 trillion. According to CoinMarketCap, BTC had a market cap of $860 billion when writing on December 6. Eyes On The SEC And Bitcoin ETFs Beyond the Bitcoin halving event and supportive macroeconomic factors, the community is also looking at regulators. In early December 2023, the crypto community expects the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to approve the first batch of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This product will provide institutional investors an avenue to get exposure to Bitcoin in a regulated environment, potentially unleashing a wave of capital. Since October, the expectations of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States have propped prices.

Legkodymov, a majority owner in the exchange, ""agreed to dissolve Bitzlato"" and release claims over some $23 million in seized assets, a U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) press release said. Bitzlato was sanctioned by the U.S government in January, when the Treasury Department and DOJ alleged it laundered some $700 million worth of funds, and Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network designated the exchange as a ""primary money-laundering concern,"" which functionally blocked it off from the global financial system.  Police had arrested Legkodymov in Florida, though his case has since been moved to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  European Union police entity Europol later alleged that Bitzlato laundered over $1 billion worth of funds. The little-known exchange's largest counterparty was darknet marketplace Hydra, the DOJ said, which allowed transactions for fake ID information, stolen financial information and money laundering.  In a statement, Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco called Bitzlato a ""safe haven for fraudsters, thieves and other criminals.""  ""We are dismantling and disrupting the cryptocrime ecosystem using all tools available – including criminal prosecution,"" she said. ""In January, the department and our partners took down Bitzlato’s infrastructure and seized its cryptocurrency. Today’s conviction of Bitzlato’s founder is the latest product of our efforts.""

The brief, 13-page legislation isn't among the big-ticket bills that the industry is desperate to see emerge from Congress, but the so-called Deploying American Blockchains Act marks a small, forward step for congressional efforts friendly to crypto. It joins several other crypto bills that have – for the first time – cleared committee votes on the way to the House floor, though none have yet won approval by the overall House.  The House Committee on Energy and Commerce, in a work session to weigh dozens of bills this week, voted 46-0 to clear the legislation that would direct the chief of the Department of Commerce ""to promote the competitiveness of the United States related to the deployment, use, application, and competitiveness of blockchain technology or other distributed ledger technology.""  The bill doesn't yet have a counterpart in the U.S. Senate – the chief drawback of most of this year's crypto legislation. The Democrat-controlled chamber hasn't rushed to embrace any of the digital assets bills and is widely thought to be unlikely to change course. The best bet for such bills could be negotiations that meld them with other efforts into larger must-pass legislation.  ""At least on the tech side of things, Energy and Commerce is unanimously in support, and there’s nothing partisan about it,"" said Ron Hammond, the Blockchain Association's director of government relations, in an interview.

21127627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564149,1701896423,"Bitcoin Pushes Into Extreme Greed, What You Should Expect From Here","The Bitcoin positive sentiment has been rising rather rapidly in the last few months as the market has staged an incredible recovery. This saw the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index go from deep fear to deep greed and that greed just continued to grow. Now, the sentiment is on the brink of extreme greed, which can be good in the short term, but could inherently turn bearish for the price. How The Fear & Greed Index Works The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index uses a number scale of 1-100 to identify how investors are feeling toward the crypto market at any given time. This index uses a number of different indicators to come up with a number which ranges from social media posts to market volatility and momentum, among others. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Rally Is Far From Over According To These Large Whales The scale is then divided into five distinct categories depending on how investors are feeling and the number that the index is on. 1-25 is considered to be extreme fear and is a time when crypto investors tend to stay away from the market due to price drops. However, this has often proven to be the best time to buy cryptocurrencies. Next is the 26-46 range which is known as the fear territory. It is one step ahead of extreme fear but is also a time when investors are not as wary despite the rampant fear. It is also a good time to buy and precede the next stage, which is neutral. Neutral is the region between 47-52 and signifies a time when investors are unsure of this market. Mainly, investors refrain from making any moves during this time, waiting for the market to swing either up or down before deciding their next move. One step above this is the greed level starting at 53 and ending at 75. At this time, investors are returning to the market and prices are recovering rapidly. This often ends up in extreme greed between 76 and 100, where major decisions are being made. BTC price reclaims $44,000 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Bitcoin Sentiment Rests At 72 The Fear & Greed Index is currently at 72, treacherously close to slipping into the extreme greed territory which could have massive implications for the price. Now, looking back at times when the index’s score has gone this high, it paints a picture of bullishness followed by bearishness. Related Reading: The Bulls Are Back: Crypto Institutional Inflows Balloon To 2021 Levels An example of this is in December 2020 when the index rose into the extreme greed territory. It would continue to rise as investors trooped into the market, eventually topping out at 91. Then what followed was a crash that sent investors spiraling. The same thing happened between October and November 2021 where the score reached extreme greed before crashing. Source: alternative.me Given how the Bitcoin price has performed whenever the score was this high, it stands to reason that extreme greed can often act as a top signal. So the index going into the 76-100 region can often signify that it is time to exit the market. If this trend does repeat, then the Bitcoin price could run further and mount more recovery. However, it is headed toward a market crash that could trap bulls who have not timed their exit correctly.

21126045,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564216,1701892858,Bitcoin’s Bullish Leap: Trading Guru John Bollinger Weighs In On BTC Ongoing Rally,"John Bollinger, known for his expertise in market analysis, has recently shared his insights on Bitcoin’s current market trajectory, noting that the premier cryptocurrency is exhibiting “signs of strength.” This observation comes when Bitcoin consistently sets new highs amid the ongoing bull run. The asset has experienced a surge, climbing above $44,000, representing a 4.5% increase over the past 24 hours. It now appears to be aiming for the next resistance level. Related Reading: Tether Strikes Gold In Bitcoin: Profits Soar Above $1 Billion Amid Bull Market Bitcoin Shows Signs Of Strength John Bollinger, the creator of the renowned Bollinger Bands, a popular technical analysis tool, has applied his methodology to gauge Bitcoin’s market movement. Bollinger Bands are typically used to measure the volatility of a financial instrument. They consist of a middle band, a simple moving average flanked by two standard deviation lines. These bands adjust with market conditions, widening during volatile periods and contracting during calmer times. Bollinger’s recent analysis highlights that Bitcoin trades outside its daily and weekly Bollinger Bands. This is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a strong continuation of the current bullish trend without any signs of divergence. On November 21, a two-bar reversal pattern was noted at the middle Bollinger Band, further reinforcing the strength in Bitcoin’s price action. The air is getting a bit thin up here, but all we see as of now are signs of strength. We are outside both the daily and weekly BBs with no divergences. The last controlling formation was the 2 bar reversal at the middle BB completed on 21 Nov. $BTCUSDhttps://t.co/B4ZU3vpTvV — John Bollinger (@bbands) December 5, 2023 Bitcoin’s Price Action: Interpreting The Signs Bitcoin’s bullish momentum continues unabated, with a near 5% surge in the past 24 hours, pushing past the $44,000 threshold. Interestingly, the cryptocurrency shows no signs of deceleration or immediate pullback. However, technical analysis on a larger scale suggests that Bitcoin might be approaching a significant retracement zone. On the one-week timeframe, an order block is present between the $48,000 and $50,000 regions. An order block is essentially a zone where significant buying or selling occurred in the past, leading to a substantial price movement. When the price revisits these blocks, they often act as key levels for potential reversals or trend continuation. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Bullish Surge Ahead: Deribit Predicts Major Price Leap In Early 2024 Should Bitcoin climb to this region, a retracement might be on the cards. However, invalidating this order block and continuing its rally might set the stage for a reversal, possibly when it reaches the breaker block around the $60,000 region. A breaker block is a specific price zone where the market has previously shown a substantial reversal, breaking through a level of resistance or support. These blocks are often seen as potential areas where the price might experience significant movements or change direction. If Bitcoin taps into this breaker block, it could indicate another pivotal moment in its price trajectory.

42391839,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwd6d,1701892652,JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon Bashes Crypto: 'I'd Shut It Down',"Even as Jamie Dimon's JPMorgan Chase has taken a prominent role among traditional financial firms in using blockchain, the CEO still says he loathes crypto.  Sen. Elizabeth Warren built on the remarks from Dimon – usually an adversary – to call for more controls on industry transactions.  JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has never been shy about trashing crypto, even while his giant Wall Street bank became a leader in using blockchain technology to move billions. At a U.S. Senate hearing Wednesday, he slammed the industry again, to the delight of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who is trying to impose restrictions to combat illicit digital transactions.  ""I've always been deeply opposed to bitcoin, crypto, etc.,"" he told senators in a hearing examining the U.S. banking industry. ""If I was the government, I'd close it down,"" he declared.  Lined up with other big-bank CEOs before the Senate Banking Committee, Dimon argued that the crypto industry gets to ""move money instantaneously"" without going through the regulatory conduits required by bankers, including sanctions and money-laundering controls. He contended that the primary use case for digital assets is criminality.  Sen. Warren jumped in to get Dimon – a longtime adversary of the progressive Wall Street critic – and other CEOs to agree with her that crypto businesses should have to follow the same anti-money-laundering rules under the Bank Secrecy Act that other regulated financial firms do. That's the main thrust of legislation she's been pushing, which industry lobbyists have countered would rope in crypto projects that have no ability to comply, effectively killing them off.  The bill has some overlap in other crypto legislative efforts, but an aggressive effort to impose such restrictions probably won't find sufficient backing in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, so it isn't likely to move toward law in the near term.  Meanwhile, Dimon's bank – which has over $3 trillion of assets, more than double the market cap of all crypto assets combined – is a major player in Wall Street's race to move their businesses onto crypto-powered infrastructure. The company just said its JPM Coin is conveying $1 billion per day, and JPMorgan's Onyx division is exploring how to meld traditional finance with blockchains.  Dimon has long differentiated between ""crypto"" and ""blockchain,"" the ledger technology that serves as the foundation for cryptocurrencies and something Dimon argues is a useful tool.

The group included Casey Rodarmor, the artist and long-time Bitcoiner who pioneered Ordinals, often referred to as ""NFTs"" on Bitcoin, which have proven popular with many users but also contributed to congestion and elevated fees on the original blockchain. Also in is Lido DAO – yes, the entire organization – because it has grown to dominate the Ethereum staking landscaping, bumping up against the 33% market-share threshold that could pose serious security concerns.  Polygon's Jordi Baylina, an early auditor of Solidity smart contracts, represents the blockchain industry's pivot this year toward zero-knowledge proofs, a type of cryptography tipped as far-reaching and potentially revolutionary. Avery Ching, a developer behind the Aptos blockchain, is presented as the embodiment of the ""VC chain."" Jesse Pollak, of Coinbase's Base, led the way among corporate-backed layer-2 networks; another nod went to the Optimism ecosystem's Karl Floersch, who helped to create the blockchain framework used by Coinbase.  Blockstream developer Lisa Neigut was cited for her work on Bitcoin's Lightning Network, while "" teaching people the world over how to sync a node."" More controversial, perhaps, is Paul Sztorc, whose ""BIP 300"" proposal to scale Bitcoin using ""drivechains"" has split the community.  It goes without saying that The Protocol readers will be familiar with many of the names from our coverage this year, including Antonio Juliano, who migrated the decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX to run on a standalone blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem away from its own layer-2 network on Ethereum; as well as Chainlink's Sergey Nazarov, who has reoriented the oracle project to focus on the fast-growing arena of interoperability between blockchains.  CENSORSHIP OR 'SPAM FILTERING?' Opinions are divided in the Bitcoin community over the efforts by a new mining pool called Ocean, guided by the feisty developer Luke Dashjr and backed by Block Inc.'s Jack Dorsey, to weed out NFT-like transactions the project characterizes as ""spam."" Leaders of the project say it was deployed using the node client software Knots, which filters out many transactions involving Ordinals inscriptions, often characterized as ""NFTs on Bitcoin."" The big idea is that some purists say the Bitcoin blockchain should remain uncluttered, to preserve it for payments. In posts on X, Dashjr deflected accusations of censorship by characterizing the move as a ""filter"" on ""spam,"" and arguing that there was a ""long-standing vulnerability"" in Bitcoin Core – the dominant software used by most users to access the blockchain – that's been ""exploited by modern spammers."" CoinDesk's Sam Reynolds reported that the number of unconfirmed transactions is rising on the Bitcoin blockchain, now at more than 260,000. ""Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code, Inscriptions bypass this limit,"" Dashjr wrote. Jason Fang, managing partner and co-founder at Bitcoin-heavy Sora Ventures, suggested that the inscriptions are likely to be safe for now, broadly speaking; many miners will avoid Ocean because processing the Ordinals transactions can be so profitable.  ALSO:  Blast, the Ethereum layer-2 project criticized (even by one of its own investors) for accepting more than $750 million in deposits with the network launch still months away, is now apparently hiring. The project's website lists two open positions for a ""Senior DevOps Engineer"" and a ""Senior Protocol Engineer.""KyberSwap offers 10% bounty to attacker who made off with $50M; according to Messari, some $20 million were stolen from the project's Arbitrum deployment, $15 million from Optimism and $7 million from Ethereum.  Elon Musk comment inspires 'Go F--K Yourself' tokens. (BTW CoinDesk was first on the now-widely-reported story that Musk's AI venture, X.AI, filed regulatory documents with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission describing an offering of up to $1 billion in equity securities.)

According to the digital-asset analysis firm Messari, the gains for Solana have coincided with signs of strong transactional activity on the network: Weekly active addresses on Solana have now returned to levels prior to last year's collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX crypto exchange. (Bankman-Fried was a major Solana booster.) Solana's total value locked, or TVL – a key metric when evaluating a blockchains prominence in decentralized finance, or DeFi – has doubled, ""indicating a robust comeback,"" the Messari analyst Ally Zach wrote in a report. What's more, she noted, ""Solana's ecosystem is diversifying beyond DeFi, with a notable increase in consumer-based applications, including social media, content monetization platforms and innovative uses of compressed NFTs."" There's also been interest from crypto users in ""airdrop farming,"" focused on applications including Jupiter, Marginfi, Drift, Zeta and JitoSol, according to the report. CoinDesk's Oliver Knight reported this week that ""Jito, Solana's liquid staking protocol, offers stakers a yield of 6.96%, a level that led to $327 million in inflows since Oct. 13.""

21124386,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564214,1701889210,Is Bitcoin Overvalued Yet? What Historical Data Suggests,"Here’s what the data of this historical on-chain indicator suggests regarding whether Bitcoin has become overvalued after its latest uptrend. Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score Hasn’t Climbed Too High Yet As the Reflexivity Research co-founder pointed out in a post on X, the BTC MVRV Z-Score readings have heated up little compared to the values observed in past bull runs. The “Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The “realized cap” refers to a capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that assumes the “true” value of any coin in circulation is the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin Since the last transaction price of any coin was likely the price at which it changed hands, one way to interpret the realized cap is that it represents the total capital the holders have invested into the asset. Since the MVRV ratio compares the market cap (the spot price) against this model, it can tell us whether the investors are holding more value than they put in right now. If the investors are holding more than what they bought the coin for (that is, they are in net profits), they might be tempted to sell, and thus, BTC might be likely to see a correction. Similarly, the market being in losses can suggest the cryptocurrency’s price is currently undervalued and might be due to a rebound. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Z-Score of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the history of the coin: The value of the metric appears to have been going up in recent days | Source: @WClementeIII on X The “Z-Score” is a statistical tool used to measure how far a data point is from the mean. In the graph, the analyst has marked two zones for the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score where BTC has attained an overbought/underbought condition. It would appear that historical bottoms in the asset’s price have formed when the metric has dipped inside the green zone. The tops haven’t been so simple, though, as they fluctuate a bit. Related Reading: Sleeping Bitcoin Giants Wake Up: Pattern Mirrors 2021 Bull Run One common thing between all tops is that they have occurred at decently high values of the indicator. At such values, the investors make very high profits, so tops naturally become significantly probable. The chart shows that the Bitcoin MVRV Z-Score has been climbing recently as the asset has rallied, but it’s yet to arrive at levels similar to past tops. “There will be corrections along the way, but zooming out Bitcoin is far from overvalued based on historical readings,” notes the analyst. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $43,800, up 15% in the last week.

21122955,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564109,1701885603,"Former FTX US President Says Bitcoin Spot ETF Will Come In 2024, Gives Price Targets","Former FTX US President Brett Harrison recently had an interview with Cointelegraph Magazine. As part of the discussion, Harrison gave his thoughts on when a Spot Bitcoin ETF will be approved and the possible price level the foremost crypto token could attain when this happens. A Spot Bitcoin ETF Could Be Approved In Q1 of 2024 Harrison is said to have mentioned that there is a very “high probability” that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a Spot BTC ETF in the first quarter of 2024. His prediction happens to be in line with the fact that the SEC has to make a decision on ARK 21Shares Spot Bitcoin ETF on or before January 10, 2024. Related Reading: Crypto Expert Delivers Top 8 Altcoins To Buy On Binance As such, there is indeed a high likelihood that a Spot Bitcoin ETF could be approved in Q1 of 2024 (and as early as January). Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas had also earlier mentioned that there is a 90% chance that approval will come by the January 10 deadline. Meanwhile, there is a growing belief that we might have more than one Spot Bitcoin ETF application approved by January 10. Seyyfart had, after the Templeton and Hashdex delay, reasoned that the SEC could be lining up all ETFs for a “full wave of approvals.” Bitcoin’s Potential Price When This Happens Harrison also gave his thoughts on what price level Bitcoin could hit when a Spot Bitcoin ETF is approved. The former FTX US President seemed to have been conservative with his price prediction as he put BTC’s potential price between $50,000 and $55,000. He doesn’t foresee the foremost crypto token hitting six figures towards the end of 2024 or early 2025. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Open Interest Falls Behind General Crypto Market, What This Means For Price His prediction about when Bitcoin could hit six figures coincides with Matrixport’s prediction of $125,000. The crypto financial services firm predicts that BTC will hit this price level by the end of 2024. Harrison’s prediction of the BTC price rising to as high as $55,000 on the back of approval seems plausible when looking at Matrixport’s projection of BTC hitting $63,140 by April 2024. Harrison is undoubtedly bullish about a Spot Bitcoin ETF and the success such an investment vehicle can enjoy. He alluded to the first day of a Bitcoin Futures ETF launching to back up his optimism. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy (BITO) ETF (the first Bitcoin futures ETF) is reported to have seen more than $1 billion in its first two days after launch. BITO became the fastest ETF ever to hit that figure. However, Harrison believes that a Spot Bitcoin ETF could go on to break more records.

The v26.0 upgrade contains experimental support for the ""v2"" transport protocol as defined by Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 324 (BIP324), which seeks to encrypt communication between nodes reducing the risks of attacks via tampering with transactions.  ""This proposal for a new P2P protocol version (v2) aims to improve upon this by raising the costs for performing these attacks substantially, primarily through the use of unauthenticated, opportunistic transport encryption,"" according to the proposal. A key benefit is that ""encryption, even when it is unauthenticated and only used when both endpoints support v2, impedes eavesdropping by forcing the attacker to become active.""  The existing V1 transport protocol remains supported. Users must enable V2 in order to start using it.  BIP324 was introduced by prominent Core contributor Dhruvkaran Mehta, who stepped away from the project in April this year to focus on a Bitcoin-related startup idea.

The speculative juices are flowing though, with a number of altcoins moving sharply higher.  Among the leaders is Avalanche’s AVAX token, whose 17% gain on Wednesday makes it the leader among those cryptocurrencies with a market value above $1 billion. This comes following the token's near-doubling in price in November.  Another big mover is Helium, the crypto connectivity project that migrated from its own blockchain to layer-1 Solana last year. It's higher by 42% on the day after the company announced it launched a mobile phone plan in the U.S. with unlimited data, texts and calls for $20 a month.  Memecoins are moving too, led by dogecoin [DOGE], which is ahead 11% over the past 24 hours to rise past $0.10 for the first time since April.

This price surge comes alongside Solana’s (SOL) remarkable 56% increase over the past 30 days and other protocols built on Solana’s network. HNT has achieved staggering gains over the past 30 days, surpassing 147%. This remarkable growth has continued with gains of 101% and 45% over the past fourteen and seven days, respectively. In the 24-hour time frame alone, HNT reached a high of $5.008 and experienced a remarkable surge of 53%, a level not seen since October 2022. But what are the main catalysts behind this spike? Helium’s Mobile Service Launch Ignites HNT Investor Frenzy The recent surge in HNT’s price can be attributed to the announcement made by the Helium network on December 5. The network revealed that users across the United States can now enjoy unlimited data, voice, and text services for a monthly fee of $20 through their newly launched mobile service. Related Reading: Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin According to recent reports, Helium Mobile, a subsidiary of Nova Labs, introduced this no-contract nationwide mobile service, aiming to provide consumers with an affordable and unrestricted mobile experience. This move comes when major carriers have been imposing data limits, increasing contract obligations, and raising prices, making Helium’s offering particularly appealing to users seeking more flexible and cost-effective options. By offering unlimited data, voice, and text services for a flat fee of $20 per month, Helium Mobile aims to address the growing demand for affordable and unrestricted mobile connectivity. According to the announcement, the company aims to empower customers by putting control back into their hands, challenging the practices of traditional carriers. CEO Amir Haleem Calls For Transparency In Mobile Industry Amir Haleem, CEO of Nova Labs, emphasized the company’s belief that cell phones are essential and that unlimited data, text, and calls should be standard offerings. Haleem criticized carriers for concealing high subscription rates, roaming fees, and additional data charges behind seemingly attractive phone upgrade options that often lock customers into costly plans for extended periods. In addition to its mobile service, Helium Mobile supports a people-powered coverage model, allowing customers to become network owners and operators. Like platforms like Airbnb or Uber, the company believes that “reducing monopolies” and empowering customers can improve service quality, lower costs, and overall benefits for all stakeholders. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Dogecoin Price Pump Of Epic Proportions To $0.7, Here’s When As the demand for reliable and affordable mobile services grows, Helium’s approach has positioned it as a key player in the industry. This announcement has propelled HNT’s price upward as investors recognize the potential of Helium’s approach in the mobile service sector. The trading price of HNT stands at $4.153, marking a significant breakout from its downtrend structure of the past 11 months. The cryptocurrency is now targeting its next resistance level at $4.70. However, should HNT fail to surpass this resistance, it will be crucial for the coin to maintain support at the $3.00 level to sustain its current bullish momentum.

Growing anticipation that U.S. authorities might soon approve one or more spot bitcoin ETF applications has been a sizable factor in the crypto's roughly 60% rally since Oct. 1, so market watchers have been on high alert for any signs of confirmation.  But just how big of a deal was BlackRock's disclosure this week? It was a positive step, suggested Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst James Seyffart, but only a step.  “I suspect this is more for operational purposes and setting things up,” Seyffart said. “It’s meaningful,"" he added, ""because it shows they are doing everything needed to launch but I don’t think it means much more than that.”  It's common for ETF issuers to raise seed capital well ahead of the launch of new products, he reminded. Seyffart also noted that the $100,000 figure is a relatively small one – a more normal amount, he said, would be closer to a couple of million.  Though the initial investment into the prospective fund isn’t as big of a deal as some made it out to be, it's still significant, said Seyffart, in that it shows BlackRock’s commitment to the fund.  Current conventional wisdom is leaning towards an early January positive SEC decision on at least some of the 13 spot bitcoin ETF applications before the agency, BlackRock's among them.

42391863,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfweQh,1701881100,Bitcoin and the Predictability of Crypto Market Cycles,"The crypto market may seem like a foreign world to many, with no real rhyme or reason for how it trades.  Just like traditional markets, though, crypto goes through its own cycles – and these price cycles are remarkably consistent, including their timing between peak-to-trough bottoms, price recoveries and subsequent rallies to new cycle highs.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  We believe we're in the early stages of anew cycle. Using bitcoin (BTC) as our benchmark, here's the typical structure of a crypto market cycle:  BTC's price peaks at a new all-time high.  BTC then suffers a painful 80% or so drawdown.  The price eventually bottoms almost exactly one year after the prior cycle's high.  BTC starts to recover and takes about two years to reach a new all-time high.  BTC continues to rally for another year before topping out at its next cycle high.  Then the cycle repeats.  The last few cycles have followed this playbook to a T.  The consistency of these cycles isn't by coincidence. It's driven by bigger, more powerful macro trends – and one that lies at the very heart of bitcoin's value proposition.  Bitcoin is not an inflation hedge in the way many believe it to be. Bitcoin is not a hedge on the Consumer Price Index, or CPI. It's a hedge against currency debasement.  That distinction is important because currency debasement is driven by monetary inflation and the expansion of central bank balance sheets. In essence, BTC is of the most leveraged bets on an expansionary liquidity environment.  Bitcoin halvings aren't the primary catalyst for BTC bull markets – liquidity cycle uptrends are. It just so happens that each halving has lined up with an expansionary liquidity environment. The next halving is expected to occur in April 2024, which once again looks to be right on cue.  That's not to say the Halving isn't important – it's a strong narrative that can certainly pour fuel on a bullish uptrend, especially if we see a spot BTC ETF approved ahead of time given liquidity upcycles tend to turbocharge fund flows.  BTC's Promising Path Ahead  Bitcoin's price bottomed in November 2022 – almost exactly one year after its last cycle peak. If BTC follows its historical playbook, that would imply a new all-time high by the fourth quarter of 2024 – and its next cycle peak roughly a year after that.  Wenoted back in the fourth quarter of 2022 that last year's downtrend in global liquidity appeared to be bottoming, putting BTC's price bottom in the rearview. The subsequent rebound in central bank liquidity has been a key support for the recovery in risk assets this year – especially crypto.  And we expect these trends to continue. Looking out over the next 12 to 18 months, we expect central bank balance sheets to continue expanding – largely because they'll have to.  Many of the world's largest economies are saddled with huge debt burdens – and here in the U.S., fiscal deficits are only expected to get worse (and that's without a recession).

42391859,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfweGR,1701881100,Why Are Pros Craving a Spot Bitcoin ETF?,"Gradually, then suddenly, as they say, bitcoin (BTC) is becoming mainstream. The biggest asset managers in the world like BlackRock and Fidelity have lined up to launch a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. Based on the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's NAV discount, which has narrowed dramatically, the market assigns a probability of around 90% that the Securities and Exchange Commission will approve such a vehicle.  But why is there such a big need for a spot bitcoin ETF in the first place, especially since there are already futures-based bitcoin ETFs?  As a starter, BTC futures ETFs have many drawbacks compared to a spot-based product, including high roll costs that can eat up to 30 percentage points (!) of the annual performance if the bitcoin futures curve exhibits a steep contango.  You're reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  In plain English: If bitcoin futures are priced significantly higher than today's spot price, bitcoin futures investors surrender a large chunk of their performance. Hence, the full performance benefits of holding bitcoin do not come to fruition when investing into a futures-based product.  Broadening investment access to bitcoin and other crypto assets can open up a whole new universe of potential portfolio allocations that were not possible before.  In portfolio managers' parlance: Investments into bitcoin significantly enlarge the so-called ""efficient frontier"" of possible multi-asset portfolios.  The efficient frontier represents all the potential portfolios displayed in a return-risk diagram based on varying weights of the different asset classes. For instance, one dot represents a portfolio that invests X% into equities, Y% into bonds and the rest into bitcoin.  Portfolio managers want to be at the very edge of that frontier since they receive the highest possible return for the lowest possible risk.  For illustrative purposes only. Source: ETC Group.  The black cloud of dots represents the universe of potential portfolios based on traditional asset classes only. The green cloud represents the whole new universe of potential portfolios when adding bitcoin. As you can see, the addition of crypto assets like bitcoin greatly expands things.  Thus, it is not surprising that including bitcoin in a classic 60/40 stock-bond multi-asset portfolio has led to a significant increase in risk-adjusted returns (""Sharpe Ratio"") in the past with only a minor increase in portfolio drawdowns.  For illustrative purposes only. Source: ETC Group.  When these spot bitcoin ETF applications will ultimately be approved is still uncertain, although the consensus expects a batch approval most likely in January.  These prospective bitcoin ETF issues have a significant amount of assets under management (we estimate around $16 trillion), so they could have a huge impact on crypto. If only a small percentage of that amount gets invested into bitcoin, the effect would most likely be very significant because, currently, bitcoin exchange-traded products only amount to $38.8 billion of assets, based on our calculations (including Grayscale's trust).  But this capital won't be invested overnight. It will probably take many months before investors start replacing parts of their traditional asset allocations with bitcoin.  Gradually, then suddenly, as they say.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETC,BTC | BUSINESS | ETC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,André Dragosch,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/12/06/why-are-pros-craving-a-spot-bitcoin-etf,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e04ef72456aeaa277468b4791141169816dfa4c6-5479x3082.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42391845,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bfwdM1,1701880578,Ethereum's 'Censorship' Problem Is Getting Worse,"For many believers in blockchain, the technology's allure lies in its open, uncontrolled nature – where decentralized networks are unfettered by the constraints and biases that shape today's internet.  But some researchers and users of Ethereum, the world's second-largest blockchain, are increasingly troubled by data showing a marked increase in censorship – what appears to be a concerted effort by block builders to exclude transactions linked to entities sanctioned by the U.S. government.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday. Also please check out our weekly The Protocol podcast.  A turning point came last year when the U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash – a ""privacy mixing"" program on Ethereum that helped people transact without leaving a trace. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) said the program was used by terrorists and other U.S.-sanctioned entities, so it added Tornado's Ethereum-based computer code to the same blacklist as Iran, North Korea and Hamas. In response, some blockchain advocates were defiant; they balked at OFAC's attempt at ""censorship"" and gloated that Ethereum would be immune to it as a result of its decentralized construction.  It hasn't really worked out that way. About 72% of data blocks posted to MEV-Boost, middleware that powers almost all of the validators that write blocks to Ethereum, are now considered ""censored,"" up from about 25% in November 2022, based on research from Toni Wahrstätter, a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation. The metric measures blocks assembled by MEV-Boost ""block builders"" which, based on statistical analysis, appear to deliberately exclude sanctioned crypto addresses.  As for why this is viewed as troubling, ""block builders have the authority to decide which transactions (and in which order) they put into their blocks and which they want to censor,"" Wahrstätter explained in a message to CoinDesk. ""This means block builders decide upon the content of the blockchain.""  Of the five largest block builders, only one of them, “Titan Builder,” claims explicitly that it does not “filter” transactions – a practice corroborated by Wahrstätter’s research.  ""If Titan would start censoring tomorrow, then Ethereum would be at over 90% censorship,"" Martin Köppelmann, the founder of Ethereum scaling network Gnosis Chain, said in an interview. ""So essentially, we're just one builder away from quite heavy censorship on Ethereum.""  Sanction-breaking transactions can still sneak their way onto Ethereum, but getting them there typically costs extra and takes longer. Wahrstätter refers to this sort of transaction throttling as censorship – an affront to what crypto is all about. Infrastructure operators might just call it ""compliance,"" a necessary step on Ethereum's journey toward mainstream adoption.  It's a marked departure from Ethereum's original pitch – as a network where ""code is law,"" where software replaces middlemen, and where ""decentralized"" networks can operate outside constraints from ""centralized"" companies and governments.  Wahrstätter's research gives a glimpse into a growing shift in Ethereum's under-the-hood transaction apparatus. The network's infrastructure has quietly become dominated by a few big players: trading bots and block builders that touch virtually all of the transactions issued onto Ethereum before they officially hit the chain's ledger.  How Ethereum works  Ethereum is a pretty simple network at its core: When a user submits a transaction, it isn't immediately added to the blockchain. Instead, it goes into a mempool – a waiting area for other yet-to-be-processed transactions. ""Validators"" then swoop in and organize those transactions into big groups, called blocks, which they officially add to the blockchain in exchange for fees and newly-minted ETH.  This pipeline has become more convoluted in recent years as people have developed strategies to earn maximum extractable value or MEV, which is the extra profit that one can squeeze from Ethereum by previewing upcoming transactions in the mempool.  Smart coders have figured out ways to ""front-run"" trades from other users, such as buying or selling tokens just before others to make an easy profit. They've also found ways to exploit spur-of-the-moment arbitrage opportunities – moving tokens between separate exchanges just before market prices will shift due to some other order in the queue.  Today, 90% of validators aren't assembling blocks themselves. Instead, they use MEV-Boost to outsource this work to third-party ""builders"" – bots that put together MEV-optimized blocks and hand them to validators.  Read more: What Is MEV, aka Maximal Extractable Value?.  From relayers to block builders  Flashbots introduced MEV-boost as a way to spread out the riches of MEV, but its decentralized marketplace of ""builders,"" ""searchers"" and ""relayers"" has quietly transformed how activity travels through Ethereum, cementing little-understood infrastructure at key chokepoints in the chain's transaction pipeline.  Soon after the U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash, MEV-Boost's ""relayers"" were blamed for censoring Ethereum. Relayers are third-party software operators that hand transactions from builders to validators, and in November 2022, Wahrstätter found that 77% of them stopped passing along blocks with OFAC-sanctioned transactions.  This large percentage resulted, in part, from the fact that a small number of relayers were available in MEV-Boost's early days, and the most popular ones were filtering out OFAC transactions. After a blowback from the Ethereum community, several ""non-censoring"" relayers entered the MEV-Boost fray, and it looked like the tide was turning back in favor of network neutrality. Today, only 30% of relayed blocks are ""censored,"" by Wahrstätter's definition.  But things seem to have swung in favor of OFAC's sanctions in recent months, largely due to a shift in behavior among MEV-Boost's builders, rather than its relayers.  Just five builders contribute more than 90% of the blocks that go onto Ethereum. Four of those five are ""censoring"" transactions, according to Wahrstätter's research.  It's not surprising to see that certain infrastructure providers, particularly those based in the U.S., have taken steps to operate cautiously when it comes to sanctions. The headline-grabbing guilty pleas last month from the crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, showed the consequences of running afoul of OFAC's rules. The U.S. Department of Justice also charged two Tornado Cash developers with money laundering and arrested one of them back in August.  ""Block builders are also just people like you and me (that have families, that might want to move to the U.S., etc),"" wrote Wahrstätter. ""It's understandable that they try to minimize the risk for themselves as individuals and their business.""  The path forward  Beyond the neutrality concerns, Wahrstätter's research highlights how Ethereum's MEV economy has centralized key elements of the chain's inner workings, a potential security risk as well as a problem for the chain's neutrality.  In addition to five builders assembling 90% of Ethereum blocks, just four relayers are behind 96% of the blocks that are sent to validators.  Centralization and censorship are top of mind for Ethereum's builders. Wahrstätter, who has been one of the loudest voices on this issue, works at the Ethereum Foundation, the main non-profit that stewards the network's development.  Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-founder and chief figurehead, has added censorship-curbing software updates to the most recent version of his proposed roadmap for the blockchain.  But even some of those solutions raise problems. For instance, some users who wish for their transactions to remain uncensored have opted to use ""private mempools"" – issuing transactions directly to builders, rather than Ethereum's mempool, to guarantee their inclusion. While this can help circumvent the censorship problem, it's not hard to see how the normalization of private order flow might introduce different problems to the network – like higher fees, less transparency and the same sorts of middlemen that blockchains were built to avoid.",NEGATIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/06/ethereums-censorship-problem-is-getting-worse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3b30eba4beb45df02ee6dc7f14a5e27aa2792d2c-936x400.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

21120066,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564126,1701878450,Tether (USDT) Cap Approaches $90 Billion: Why This Affects Bitcoin,"Data shows that the Tether (USDT) market cap is almost $90 billion. Here’s why this growth could matter for the price of Bitcoin. Tether Market Cap Has Continued To Observe A Rise Recently Tether is a cryptocurrency pegged to the US Dollar, meaning its price remains stable around the $1 mark. The asset is the most famous such “stablecoin” in the sector, with its market cap outstripping any other stable’s. As the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock pointed out, the largest stablecoin supply has only continued to grow recently. The chart below shows the trend in the market caps of the various stablecoins in the cryptocurrency sector over the past year. Looks like the metric has been growing for USDT in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, Tether has observed an overall uptrend during the past year, while USD Coin (USDC), the next largest competitor, has observed outflows as its market cap has fallen. Related Reading: Sleeping Bitcoin Giants Wake Up: Pattern Mirrors 2021 Bull Run The chart also puts into perspective how small the other stables are when compared to these two assets, making them perhaps insignificant for the wider market. What relevance does a large stablecoin like Tether have for Bitcoin and other coins in the sector? The answer to that question lies in what the stablecoins represent. Generally, investors make use of stables whenever they want to avoid the volatility associated with the other assets in the sector. The holders keeping their capital locked in these fiat-tied tokens usually plan to return towards the volatile side, however, as they would have gone for fiat itself if they wanted to keep away from cryptocurrency altogether. When such investors finally move back towards coins like Bitcoin, they naturally put buying pressure on their prices. For this reason, the supply of stablecoins could be considered the “potential buying supply” for BTC and others. There are two ways the USDT market cap grows. The first is an influx of fresh capital directly going to the asset, which is naturally a bullish development as it means the total capital in the sector goes up. The second is through a swap from another coin like Bitcoin. In this case, the overall capital present in the sector wouldn’t change, as it’s just a reshuffling, but whatever asset is being sold in favor of the stablecoin would naturally see some decline. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana At Risk Of Pullback: Here Is The Target The most bullish scenario for the market is, therefore, when both the BTC price and Tether market cap head up, as it implies, a fresh influx of capital is happening towards both the coins. As analyst James V. Straten explained in a post on X, the correlation between the USDT market cap and BTC has almost hit 100% during this latest rally, as both have shot up. The value of the metric seems to have been high recently | Source: @jimmyvs24 on X The USDT market cap continuing to grow in these circumstances is certainly an optimistic sign for the current rally, as it means that all this dry powder that’s accumulating could potentially be deployed into Bitcoin should the surge slow down, helping extend the move further. BTC Price Bitcoin had breached the $44,000 mark earlier in the past day, but the asset has since seen some pullback as it’s now back around $43,800.

Bitdeer has partnered with chipmaker Nvidia to offer AI cloud services, while Canaan is reorganizing its business to make AI an independent operation. Developing AI-related businesses can provide a hedge against volatile crypto markets and help boost the companies' valuations in the long term. What do you do with your business model after the latest hot trend in cryptocurrencies goes cold? You turn to the next hot area, in this case artificial intelligence ('AI'). At least that’s the latest approach coming from two of the crypto-related companies we follow, Canaan Inc. ( CAN ) and Bitdeer Technologies Holding Co. ( BTDR ). After getting burned by gyrations in digital asset prices, the latest forays by each of these companies looks reasonably prudent. Such moves may even look relatively moderate compared with drastic business transformations many Chinese ventures often undergo when their original businesses come under fire. Last Thursday, Bitdeer, which operates a cryptocurrency mining platform, said it will launch an AI cloud service with big-name chipmaker Nvidia ( NVDA ), arguably the hottest name right now in AI microchips. Under the collaboration, Bitdeer will be a preferred cloud service provider in Nvidia’s partner network, meaning Bitdeer’s Singapore data center will become one of the first providers of AI cloud services powered by an Nvidia product. And in its latest quarterly earnings report released two days earlier, Canaan, one of the world’s largest bitcoin mining machine makers, briefly mentioned that it’s working on an internal reorganization to make its AI business an independent operation. On the company’s earnings call, its management elaborated, saying it is seeking to create a separate AI unit that could even attract its own financing. In addition to its core business making crypto mining machines, Canaan also makes chips for AI applications. “Given the significant changes in the AI industry over the past few months, we have been strategically discussing the future of our AI business,” Canaan CEO Zhang Nangeng said. “In light of our current industry and the marketing environment, we believe that the development of our AI business should take a more defined, independent, and long-term direction.” The two companies’ efforts to develop AI-related businesses make quite a lot of sense, since revenue from services and products linked to the hot emerging technology can provide them with a nice hedge against wildly volatile crypto markets. Bitdeer already offers hosting services for crypto mining, so presumably it can repurpose its computing resources to use for AI applications like cloud services. Similarly, developing AI-specific chips isn’t too far from Canaan’s main expertise that includes detailed knowledge of chips used in its crypto mining machines. Such shifts are much more related to their core businesses than the complete overhauls sometimes seen at Chinese tech companies, often in desperate attempts to survive rough times. Two China-linked crypto miners, The9 ( NCTY ) and BIT Mining ( BTCM ), are the products of such radical transformations, with the former originally a game operator and the latter an online lottery ticket seller. Crypto winter Any company in the digital asset ecosystem probably understands the need for business diversification amid a prolonged crypto winter, despite a recent rally in currencies. Canaan’s latest quarterly results vividly illustrate this cold reality. Its revenue shrank 77% year-on-year to $33 million in the third quarter as sales of its mining machines dropped, according to its latest results. The company has its own mining business as well, and revenue from that operation took a similar dive because of a temporary shutdown in Kazakhstan to comply with new regulations and a contract breach by a project partner in the U.S. While Canaan’s revenue plunged, its cost of revenue decreased at a far slower rate of less than 30%, partly because write-downs for inventory and prepayments increased. And its operating expenses actually increased. As a consequence, Canaan ended up in the red in the third quarter, swinging from a small net profit a year earlier. Bitdeer fared better. It managed to post about 14% year-on-year revenue growth to $87.3 million for the period by deploying more computing power to produce production of virtual coins and increasing its hosting capacity, according to its quarterly results released last month. The company still remained in the red, although its net loss narrowed substantially. One recent bright spot for both companies is the rally for digital tokens. The value of bellwether cryptocurrency bitcoin is up more than 150% this year, with growing optimism that current price levels are sustainable. There are some compelling explanations for the price surge. For one, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') may approve the first spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund ('ETF'), which many think can be a game-changer by giving an official regulatory stamp of approval to a virtual currency-linked investment product. Also, an event known as bitcoin halving, which is expected to take place next year, will reduce the amount of new bitcoin entering the market, helping push up the currency’s value. A rise in bitcoin and other cryptocurrency prices would probably lift the fortunes for both Bitdeer and Canaan, which could plow some of any future profits into developing other revenue sources like AI-related products to hedge against future crypto downturns. For all the recent bullish sentiment in crypto markets, Canaan management sounded a wary tone on its latest earnings call. “I believe that the fourth quarter has shown signs of improvement compared to the third quarter,” said Clark Soucy, Canaan’s investor relations director. “However, we shouldn’t expect the best-case scenario of both rising price and (trading) volumes to happen quickly. Based on the overall situation mentioned above, we provide a highly cautious outlook for the fourth quarter of 2023.” Such caution is probably warranted, given the well-documented history of volatility in crypto markets. At the moment, both Bitdeer’s and Canaan’s revenue are heavily reliant on crypto activities, meaning each has a long way to go in their nascent diversification drives. Canaan shares currently trade at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.6.

( BTM ) operates the largest cryptocurrency ATM network in North America through more than 6,400 kiosks. The company became publicly traded following a SPAC merger IPO earlier this year. While the idea of converting cash for Bitcoin may seem rudimentary, there's a real business here with Bitcoin Depot currently profitable and on track to conduct over $700 million in transactions this year. That being said, growth has disappointed, with plenty of reasons to be skeptical of this model. As it relates to the stock, BTM is tiny with a current market cap of just around $150 million, down more than 30% since August. Still, we took a look, and our take is that there are enough positive developments to keep this story interesting. Ultimately, Bitcoin Depot is highly speculative but we believe 2024 will be a critical year for the company to define its long-term strategy. Data by YCharts BTM Financials Recap BTM reported its Q3 results with revenue of $179 million, up 3% year-over-year. Keep in mind that this figure captures the transaction volume of total customer Bitcoin purchases while its adjusted gross profit is likely a better measure of the ""fee income"" net the costs of sourcing the Bitcoin. For context, Bitcoin Depot charges a $3.00 per transaction fee while also offering Bitcoin at an up to 23% markup from quoted spot prices. Favorably, the adjusted gross profit at $27 million was up 29% year-over-year, also at a higher margin of 15% compared to 12% in Q3 2022. That strength flowed into a 17% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $14 million, while net income of $1 million fell from $3 million last year, reflecting an accounting adjustment to lease liabilities. source: company IR So while the numbers here are ""solid"", revenue came in below published estimates and also slowed compared to the pace in Q2. We can also point out that the level of transactions up just 3% y/y implies a decline in the number of transactions considering the price of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) during Q3 at ~$28k was up the $21k level in Q3 2023. Management has made a point of suggesting transaction volumes have been historically decoupled or uncorrelated with Bitcoin prices. This sounds great when the price of Bitcoin is falling, but it would be more encouraging to see a positive correlation, particularly in an environment where Bitcoin prices are rallying. source: company IR A theme for the company has been an expansion into its ""BDCheckout"" program now available at 5,400 retail locations across 29 states. Instead of the traditional ""ATM kiosks"", BDCheckout allows customers to purchase Bitcoin with cash at partner retail registers through an app-generated QR code. The idea here represents a new growth driver through a relatively limited capex requirement. In terms of the kiosk network, keep in mind that approximately 32% of all transactions are through locations connected with ""Circle K"" gas stations and convenience stores, a subsidiary of Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. ( ANCTF ) which has embraced the technology with over 1,400 kiosk placements. The plan is to partner with new retailers following a similar model going forward as part of the growth strategy. Notably, Bitcoin Depot has a pending application to enter New York State, one of the few markets it currently does not have access to. source: company IR For the full-year 2023 pending the Q4 results, management is guiding for consolidated revenue between $700 million and $730 million, representing an 8% to 13% increase over 2022. The expectation is that an adjusted EBITDA of between $56 million and $59 million if confirmed, would represent a ~40% increase at the midpoint over 2022. On the balance sheet, the company ended the quarter with $30 million in cash against around $34 million in total debt. Considering the currently positive cash flow, we view the balance sheet position as stable. There is also a $10 million stock buyback authorization through June 2024. What's Next For BTM? The good news is that the ongoing rally in the price of Bitcoin above $40,000 is helping to revitalize interest in this segment following what was a historically volatile 2022. The bullish case for Bitcoin Depot over the near term is that sentiment begins to approach the speculative frenzy seen in 2020 or even going back to the big run in 2017 that brought a wave of new buyers and demand into the market. While we expect Bitcoin Depot to see some boost into 2024 based on current market conditions, this outlook for top-line growth of around 10% leaves a lot to be desired. Seeking Alpha What we want to see is a re-acceleration of transition volume, not just from the expansion efforts, but some indication that the ATMs are being used more often and by more people. On that point, consumers have an abundance of options in terms of methods for acquiring Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, with the sense that physical ATMs are simply losing their importance compared to fintech players. Management explains that nearly two-thirds of users are using Bitcoin Depot kiosks for remittances, as a way of sending other people ""money"". With all due respect, there are better ways than paying a 23% markup. source: company IR We mentioned the stock's current market cap of $150 million. This figure considers the current outstanding 60.8 million share count. Keep in mind that Bitcoin Depot maintains outstanding share warrants, and earn-outs that are considered potentially dilutive above certain exercise prices and vesting levels. By this measure, we calculate a current enterprise value for the stock closer to $300 million. This means that with management's full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance, BTM is valued at approximately 6x forward EBITDA. While this level can be considered ""cheap"", the argument we make is that the risk level and uncertainties over the long-term viability of the business model justify a discounted valuation. source: company IR It's difficult to look out 5 or 10 years from now and have some certainty that Bitcoin ATMs will still be a ""thing"". Not because Bitcoin will fail, but more of the fact that there are many other viable alternatives for consumers to acquire Bitcoin digitally and more effectively. We'd say that this is a tough business to invest in for the long run considering the competitive environment. Final Thoughts We rate BTM as a hold, taking a neutral view of the stock from the current level. The strong points here include the path to profitability, a solid balance sheet, and at least steady growth to support some intrinsic value in the share. On the other hand, we also believe there are better investment opportunities in the broader crypto sector. The main risk to consider is the possibility that operating and financial metrics underperform over the next several quarters. A scenario where the price of Bitcoin trades significantly lower for any number of reasons may also limit demand for ATM transactions and open the door for a leg lower in the stock. Financial margins and cash flow trends will be key monitoring points going forward.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | ICO | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656300-bitcoin-depot-enough-positives-to-keep-it-interesting?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21117922.jpeg

Significance Of Coinbase New Transfer Features On Tuesday, Coinbase announced its latest feature for its wallet to simplify and hasten global money transfers. The new feature is presented as a user-friendly procedure. According to the crypto firm, the new initiative is described as “Send money with a link.” Within the Coinbase Wallet, users can generate a link to distribute via their favorite social media platforms. Related Reading: Coinbase (COIN) Up By 250% – Here’s Why It’s Outperforming BTC And ETH However, the exchange noted that the wallet must be owned by both the receiver and the sender of the money. Furthermore, users who do not have the wallet, when emailed a link, will be prompted to download it from Apple or Android app stores. The crypto company further asserted the safety of the new initiative. Coinbase noted that failure to retrieve sent funds within weeks will automatically send the money back to the sender. The company stated: When your recipient clicks the shared link, it’ll take them into the Coinbase Wallet app to claim or direct them to download the Coinbase Wallet app on iOS or Android and create a new wallet in just 1-click. It’s that simple. And if the funds are not claimed within 2 weeks, they will automatically be returned to the sender. Coinbase has highlighted several situations where this new feature is “very efficient and helpful.” These include paying off debts with friends, giving last-minute gifts, and tipping tour guides and other service providers. In addition, the feature sparks a swift money-sending procedure. This eliminates downloading different apps or sorting through many usernames and profiles. Furthermore, the crypto firm asserted that the new feature is vital for people in high-inflation economies. Latest Feature To Eliminate Payment Irregularities The procedure eliminates the expenses and complications of using traditional methods to send money globally. Traditionally, sending money globally has required sifting through a complex web of bank account and routing details. Related Reading: Coinbase Holds $25 Billion Worth Of Bitcoin, Becomes Largest Holder With 1M BTC In addition, these transactions take longer to process, mostly up to five working days. However, the Coinbase wallet boasts instantaneous settlement and zero-fee transactions. Coinbase wallet is supported by over 170 countries worldwide and is available in 20 languages. This guarantees the ability to send and receive money virtually anywhere. Furthermore, it currently supports local fiat onramps from more than 130 countries. These include top payment processors like Pix in Brazil, Instant P2P Bank in Nigeria, and GCash in the Philippines.

42409266,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFaxu,1701871200,Worldcoin Foundation $5M Grants Program Focuses on 'Equitable Systems',"The Worldcoin Foundation, a non-profit that supports the development of the Worldcoin protocol, announced on Wednesday a $5 million community grants program called “Wave0.”  The grants are supposed to give developers a “focus on building resilient technology and more equitable systems” on Worldcoin, according to a draft press release seen by CoinDesk. The foundation will commit $5 million in funding across three grant tracks, and will be made in WLD token, the native token for the Worldcoin protocol, which runs on the Ethereum blockchain.  Remco Bloemen, the head of protocol at the Worldcoin Foundation, told CoinDesk in an interview that the grants are not just aimed at developers, but that “there's a larger community effort here to be made, which is also like raising awareness, educating people of the importance” of the work the technology tries to solve, in terms of “income inequality, governance and other existential risks.”  The grants will be given to projects that are looking into research and development efforts, such as the intersection of privacy and biometrics, Bloemen said. Other grant recipients could be those who come up with use cases that leverage Worldcoin and World ID.  This news comes as Sam Altman, the co-founder of Tools for Humanity, which is the primary developer firm behind Worldcoin, found himself in a messy kerfuffle with OpenAI, after initially being fired and then eventually rehired as CEO.  Despite OpenAI’s mission, Worldcoin remains committed to decentralization, Alex Blania, the co-founder and CEO of Tools for Humanity, the leading developer behind the protocol, told CoinDesk in an interview. Project officials previously had said that Altman's role at Worldcoin was unaffected by the governance upheaval at OpenAI.  “In five years, neither Sam or me will matter at all for what happens to Worldcoin. It's a process and that's kind of how we think about it,” Blania said. “It’s fundamentally very different from OpenAI.”  Read more: Worldcoin's Mainnet, WLD Token Goes Live",POSITIVE,WLD,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY | WLD,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/12/06/worldcoin-foundation-5m-grants-program-focuses-on-equitable-systems,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d3d66a11905593f764e725c3e8d1cfa165f0688a-1917x1078.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409282,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFblV,1701869977,First Mover Americas: Traders Are Turning to Ether,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Key derivatives market metrics show sophisticated traders are turning their attention to ether (ETH) from the recent market standout, bitcoin (BTC), hinting at a potential outperformance of Ethereum's native token in the coming weeks. Bitcoin has rallied over 60% this quarter, while ether, the supposedly deflationary currency with bond-like appeal and an ESG-compliant label, has lagged big time, gaining just 35%, CoinDesk data show. The performance gap is even wider over larger time frames, with bitcoin boasting a 163% year-to-date gain versus ether's 89%.  IBM has released a cryptographic signing technology for handling digital assets in cold storage, reducing the risks associated with manual procedures while keeping assets at arm's length from an internet connection. The tech giant said in a statement on Tuesday that its IBM Hyper Protect Offline Signing Orchestrator (OSO) helps protect high-value transactions by offering additional security layers, including disconnected network operations, time-based security and electronic transaction approval by multiple stakeholders. In recent years, IBM has been applying its gravitas in key management, specifically its confidential computing suite of technologies, to digital assets and cryptocurrencies.  Asset manager BlackRock and crypto investment firm Bitwise both filed amended S1 forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, answering further questions probably asked by the regulator in earlier conversations. While it is unclear which topics the SEC asked applicants to provide further information for, analysts had predicted that changes to the prior filings would be made following several meetings between the SEC and applicants last week. The filings signal that both parties are “working hard to iron things out,” Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart wrote on X. Amendments by the other 11 applicants, including Fidelity, Franklin and WisdomTree, are likely to follow soon, he said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the most active bitcoin options of the past 24 hours.  While calls have seen the most volume, some traders have traded puts at strikes $41,000 and $41,500.  The flows are consistent with options skew, which shows traders are looking to protect themselves from a potential price slide.

21115627,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564118,1701867601,"XRP Price: Crypto Analyst Anticipates 65,000% Rally Signal Today","The XRP price has been rather stagnant in recent days. However, this could be about to change according to crypto analyst Jaydee. In a recent technical analysis, Jaydee has highlighted a potential golden cross on the 4-day chart which may be confirmed as soon as today. Crucial XRP Price Signal Today? The chart presented by Jaydee shows a potential golden cross, a bullish chart pattern that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. The last occurrence of a golden cross was followed by an impressive 650-fold increase in XRP’s price, according to the analyst. Jaydee posted on X (formerly Twitter), “XRP – Golden cross on 4-day chart confirming today? Will this help us break the 8 year trendline? Last time it did this, XRP 650x! Although it won’t make the same gains, the gains coming will be LIFE CHANGING for the 5% who take “calculated” profits!” In the history of the XRP price, there have been two occasions in which Jaydee’s golden cross has taken place. The first was in March 2017, which was followed by a massive rally that saw the price rise from below $0.005 to its all-time high of $3.31. The rise represented a price gain of over 65,000%. Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Skyrocket 1,100% On This Signal: Crypto Analyst The second time was in December 2020, when the price rose from around $0.17 to as high as $1.95. This represented a price appreciation of an incredible 1,040%. However, the rally came to an abrupt end when it was rejected at Jaydee’s “8-year trend line”. How High Can The Price Rise? This long-standing resistance level has capped the XRP price growth several times since its inception. Based on the monthly chart, the XRP price has been rejected at the descending trend line a total of 6 times since January 2018. This is another similarity to the 65,000% rally which started in March 2017. The chart by Jaydee outlines a notable 4-year trendline breakout that occurred after the Golden Cross appeared. If history repeats, the price could target the upper end of the trendline very soon, if the golden cross is confirmed today. Related Reading: XRP Lawsuit: Full History, News, Schedule And Price Predictions Currently, the digital asset’s price is hovering around the $0.63 mark. According to Jaydee, the price could go straight up to the resistance of the descending 8-year trendline. Notably, the XRP price would have to rise to the region around $0.82 to touch the resistance. The yellow arrow in Jaydee’s chart shows where the XRP price could move. Even if the crypto analyst does not name a specific target, he indicates with the yellow arrow that XRP could potentially reach over $20 by 2025. In response to community member James’ query regarding the possibility of a 650x increase, Jaydee cautiously tempered expectations. While acknowledging the historical bull runs, Jaydee stated, “I wish.. highly doubt it though brotha.” At press time, XRP traded at $0.6244.

21114313,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564108,1701864002,Bitcoin Bull Rally Is Far From Over According To These Large Whales,"Bitcoin has really heated up in the past few weeks, pushing its price above consecutive price resistances to reach new yearly highs. Bitcoin recently pushed past $44,000, registering gains of 15% in a 7-day timeframe. However, while the price gain can be partly attributed to hype around the spot Bitcoin ETFs, on-chain data shows increased activity among many big holders. According to the on-chain analytics platform Santiment, the recent surge in the price of BTC has been connected with an increase in the number of wallets holding more than 100 BTC. Large Bitcoin Wallets Increase Purchases An X post by Santiment has revealed the amount of wallets holding 100 BTC or more has been on the rise for four weeks. Bitcoin went through unprecedented gains in October, and whales and large holders holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC increased by 16 wallets. As a result, BTC continued on its price climb, pushing $30,000, the first of many to come in the following weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rises To $41,000: How Much Profit Has Microstrategy Made On Its BTC Bet? However, Santiment data shows that the number of large wallets saw a big drop-off on November 9, correlating with a brief period of profit-taking which saw Bitcoin drop from $37,000 to $35,500 by November 15. Things started to change by mid-November, indicating that the bull rally wasn’t slowing down. The number of whale addresses holding 100 BTC or more started to rise around this time period, and 48 of these whale wallets have returned in the past four weeks, indicating these large players have been busy stocking up on BTC during the rally. According to Santiment data, there are now around 16,000 of these wallets. 🐳 #Bitcoin‘s climb has continued, reaching $44K just 2 hours ago. The amount of existing 100+ $BTC wallets have correlated tightly with this price climb. Since a big drop-off on November 9th, 48 of these whale wallets have returned in the past 4 weeks. https://t.co/4lNBvn1HB3 pic.twitter.com/jJYVsPSbfk — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 5, 2023 More BTC Gains In December? December has historically been a mixed month of performance for Bitcoin. However, the last time the crypto registered price gains in October and November, it would go on to spike another 46.92% in December. A repeat could see Bitcoin reach above $55,000 before the end of the year. Source: X The recent Bitcoin price rally is somehow different from past rallies, as potential catalysts for a price surge like the next halving and the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US are still yet to happen. Santiment’s on-chain metric regarding whale wallets reiterates the position of many crypto analysts predicting that the recent price surge is just the start of an extended bull run that will continue through 2024.

21112951,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564107,1701860420,"Ethereum Price 2023 Breakthrough: Surpassing Bitcoin, Altcoin Surge Next?","For the first time in 2023, the Ethereum price has outperformed Bitcoin across several metrics, hinting at a fundamental shift in market structure. The second cryptocurrency by market capitalization follows the general sentiment in the sector, setting new yearly highs. Related Reading: XRP Greed Index Soars, Backed By Robust $1.3 Billion Volume – Good For Price? As of this writing, the Ethereum price trades at $2,300 with a 4% profit in the last 24 hours. Over the previous week, the cryptocurrency recorded a 10% profit, with most of the altcoin sector still lagging the current price action. Ethereum Price Signals Strength For Altcoin Sector? A report from BlockScholes posted by the options platform Deribit indicates a spike in the Ethereum price volatility back to its levels above Bitcoin’s. ETH’s shift in market structure hints at traders and institutions gearing up for early 2024. The report claims that the potential approval of a spot in the US ETH Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) is behind the current price action. This new dynamic suggests that the bullish sentiment above this event slipped from Bitcoin to Ethereum. As seen in the chart below, Ethereum records a higher return than Bitcoin for the first time since July 2023. The surge in returns, BlockSholes said, allowed ETH to buck a persistent downtrend, but overall, the cryptocurrency’s performance remains in its yearly range. In other words, the Ethereum price is doing better than in other periods across 2023 but has yet to resume a bullish momentum concerning Bitcoin. However, the report noted: This reversal is not yet strong enough for us to be confident in a return to the market structure that we had previously come to expect, but does indicate that the effects of speculative bets around the application of a spot ETF are not limited to BTC. This is echoed by the implied volatilities for both assets across the term structure, which forecast similar volatility levels for both assets. What Favors An Altcoin Rally In addition, the report noted a decline in the US dollar as measured by the DXY Index. Risk assets can thrive as the currency trends lower, potentially hinting at a loose monetary policy by the Federal Reserve (Fed). If Ethereum continues gaining bullish momentum from its current levels, the entire altcoin sector could see further profits. The report indicates that most entities and traders are pricing in a “risk event” by the end of January 2024.

Whichever coin prevails might reveal more information on the subsequent trend; if Ethereum outperformed, then altcoins are more likely to follow.

DOGE, the world's leading meme cryptocurrency, has gained over 10% in the past 24 hours to trade above $0.10 for the first time since April, according to data tracked by TradingView. The prices has gained 27% in seven days, seemingly tracking bitcoin's surge to $44,000 from $38,000.  The notional open interest – or the dollar value locked in the number of active futures and perpetual futures contracts – tied to DOGE has risen by 58% to $625 million in one week, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2022, according to data source CoinGlass. That increase, alongside a rising price, is said to confirm the uptrend.  Funding rates on several exchanges have surged to an annualized 50% or more, indicating a steep premium in perpetual futures relative to spot prices, Velo Data data show. Positive rates indicate investor preference for long, or bullish, bets and reflect collective optimism that prices will likely increase.  Joke cryptocurrencies are high-beta assets with a history of moving in the direction of bitcoin, only more so. In other words, they behave as leveraged plays on the largest cryptocurrency.  Thus, investors should be watchful of potential extreme bullish action in DOGE relative to bitcoin as an indicator of speculative froth often observed at the tail end of the marketwide bullish trend.  DOGE's latest surge, though impressive, isn't necessarily a sign of excess greed, considering the DOGE/BTC ratio remains at bear-market depths.  A rapid surge in the ratio presaged BTC's April 2021 top above $60,000 and the market-wide FTX-induced panic of November 2022.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE,BTC | BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/06/over-600m-locked-in-open-dogecoin-futures-as-doge-price-hits-highest-since-april,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e4dc8b9b38550ac4334c86ae399a95c3a0dffa7d-2766x834.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bonk, a Shiba Inu-themed token first issued last December, has returned over 1,000% in the past month amid a capital inflow to the Solana blockchain and an increase in riskier bets on tokens based on the network.  A more than 70% surge since Sunday has catapulted bonk to become the third-largest dog-themed token, behind dogecoin [DOGE] and shiba inu (SHIB). Its $500 million market capitalization is now greater than floki's (FLOKI) $400 million and BabyDogeCoin’s $350 million.  Despite being initially fashioned as a meme coin, bonk saw quick adoption in the Solana ecosystem after it was introduced. Several Solana projects integrated the token for use as payment for NFTs, and some introduced ""burn"" mechanisms for NFT-based events in the weeks after launch.  Bonk has been a team of 22 individuals with no singular leader, all of whom were involved in the inception of the project, CoinDesk previously learned from one of the several developers. All have previously built decentralized applications (dapps), non-fungible tokens (NFT) and other related products on Solana.  Since October, strong interest in the Solana ecosystem seems to have boosted the token's attraction. Trading volume crossed $80 million on Tuesday – a 10-fold increase from the $8 million daily average at the start of November.  Data shows traders have also opened highly leveraged bets on the token with the rise in prices. Open interest – or the amount of unsettled futures positions – climbed to $100 million on Tuesday, compared with under $10 million at the start of November.  Other dog-themed tokens also gained in the past 24 hours, CoinGecko data shows. DOGE surged 16% and SHIB jumped 10%.

This occurred on a day when rising optimism caused the cryptocurrency market as a whole to rise by 5%. XRP has increased by 4% over the past month and by 1.5% in only one week. It is currently the fifth-largest token by market capitalization, having increased by a remarkable 80% since the start of the year. This demonstrates how, in the cryptocurrency world, XRP is moving to its own rhythm. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulldozes Past $44,000 – Is $45K Next This Week? XRP Shows Renewed Vigor Thanks to the general surge in the cryptocurrency market, the token has emerged from a protracted hibernation with encouraging indicators. Even while it hasn’t fully restored to its former splendor, the remnants of its strength are beginning to flare once more. In the upcoming days, analysts project another 15% increase, bringing its value to $0.72. Technical indicators show cautious optimism, scoring 72 for “Greed” and neutral positive mood. XRP Greed Index at 72. Source: Coincodex When a cryptocurrency’s index is labeled “Greed,” it indicates a positive market sentiment where investors are optimistic and more willing to take risks. This sentiment is measured on a scale ranging from extreme fear to extreme greed, with a “Greed” leaning suggesting heightened confidence and positive expectations among market participants. A surge in buying demand might push XRP’s price higher and into the $0.65–$0.71 supply zone. Confirmation of the continuation of the intermediate trend would require a break and close above this order block’s midline, at $0.68. The price of XRP might then aim for the psychological level of $0.8000 if this order block were to flip into support. XRP market cap currently at $34.12 billion on the daily chart: TradingView.com With the approval of the Bitcoin ETF and probable rate cuts bringing about a potential full-fledged bull market next year, it is feasible that the market-wide surge of today marks the beginning of an end-of-year rally. If this is the case, Ripple’s recent wins over the SEC and the company’s recent expansion should assist XRP immensely. While XRP’s 24-hour trading volume has surpassed $1.3 billion, the altcoin’s support level is still rising gradually. This indicates that during that period, a sizable sum of XRP was bought and traded. Source: Changelly XRP’s Momentum: Rising Support, Increased Trading Signal Growth Positive sentiment is often associated with rising support levels since they show that more traders and investors are prepared to purchase XRP at higher prices, and bigger trading volumes signify more activity and liquidity in the market. This is still far below the $3 billion-plus levels observed at the beginning of November, but being a significant increase over the levels seen in September and early October. Put differently, there is ample opportunity for XRP’s current surge to continue and perhaps even pick up more momentum. #XRP – Last time MACD crossed 0 level, $XRP went PARABOLIC!

As JD noted, the “parabolic” spike in XRP occurred at the same moment that the MACD last moved above zero. Although it hasn’t happened this time, he says the market is quickly getting close to that point. Related Reading: PEPE Inks 46% Weekly Gain – Can It Leap To The $1 Jackpot?

21109549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=564095,1701851707,Bloomberg Experts Forecast Timeline For Spot Ethereum ETF Approval,"The journey towards the approval of an Ethereum ETF in the United States has seen a new development yesterday as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced a delay in the decision for Grayscale’s Ethereum trust conversion into a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The SEC has stated the need for an extended period to evaluate the proposed rule change, pushing the new deadline Grayscale to January 25, 2024. In its reasoning, the SEC has reiterated, “The commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” Notably, the delay comes at a time where the US agency is working with now 13 spot Bitcoin ETF applicants on presumably the final amendments before a January 10 approval. Timeline For A Spot Ethereum ETF Approval Despite the latest delay, the crypto community remains optimistic about the future of spot Ethereum ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart has suggested that delays are par for the course, tweeting, “Update: As expected Grayscale’s Ethereum trust filing just got delayed. It was due by 12/6/23 so this is completely normal.” Seyffart also shared a table of all seven spot Ethereum ETF applicants: VanEck, 21Shares & ARK, Hashdex, Grayscale, Invesco & Galaxy, BlackRock, Fidelity and their deadlines. He further hinted at potential approvals by mid-2024, responding to criticisms from Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream, with “Unfortunately I think you’re gonna be really upset by June of next year.” In response to queries about the probability of an Ethereum ETF approval following a Bitcoin ETF, Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg has indicated that the first filers, Ark and VanEck, have strong odds of approval by their final deadline on May 23, 2024, as they are expected to use the same mechanics as spot Bitcoin ETFs, and due to the fact that Ether futures have already received the green light from the US SEC. Related Reading: Ethereum At $2,200 Is “Hilarious”; Is A 10X Incoming? Queried about for the odd of a spot Ethereum ETF approval, he remarked, “Not formally yet, but final deadline for the first filers Ark and VanEck is May 23rd so strong odds they approved by then given they’d be using same design as btc etfs and ether futures were Ok’d.” The Next Deadlines The table by Seyffart shows that the next Ethereum ETF deadlines are from December 23 to 26 for VanEck, Ark Invest and Invesco & Galaxy, followed by Hashdex on January 1. Since a spot Bitcoin ETF is very unlikely to be approved by then, delays by the SEC are more than likely for this batch of filings. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says It’s “Not Too Late” To Buy Ethereum, Here’s Why Both iShares by BlackRock and the Fidelity Ethereum Fund have their next deadlines on January 25 and January 21, 2024 respectively. These dates are crucial as they could involve either an extension, a request for more information, or a final decision. But things only get really tense towards the final deadlines for all Ethereum ETF filers, as outlined by both Bloomberg ETF experts. With VanEck poised for May 23, 2024, and ARK Invest for May 24, 2024 and other notable filers like Hashdex Nasdaq Ethereum ETF and Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust Conversion (ETHE) scheduled for decisions by May 30, 2024, and June 18, 2024, respectively, the timeline for potential approvals is taking shape.

42409276,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFbYH,1701849963,Bitcoin Surge Blasts $170M in Bearish Shorts as BTC Price Targets $48K,"Bitcoin’s ever-growing prices are leaving at least one group startled by the rapid bumps: Those placing highly leveraged short futures bets aimed at profiting from potential price reversal.  Short traders betting against higher bitcoin [BTC] prices lost some $90 million on Tuesday alone, adding to the $70 million in short liquidations on Monday, according to data source CoinGlass. These may have contributed to the asset’s strength since the start of this week – a move that has seen it jump to $44,000 from $39,000.  Liquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader’s leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader’s initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).  Large liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.  Most of these liquidations have occurred on crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Huobi, data from CoinGlass shows. Trading volumes have surged 25% in the past week, and open interest has grown to $20.2 billion from $17.2 billion at the start of December.  Several factors look to be aiding bitcoin growth. There’s optimism around a possible spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval in the U.S., traders pricing in expected rate cuts in the U.S. – which buoys risky bets such as technology stocks and bitcoin – and possible sovereign adoption as bitcoin-friendly leaders take the helm in major economies.  At least one group of traders placed a $200 million BTC futures position over the weekend, as reported, indicative of the high demand for bitcoin exposure. Such moves come alongside continual spot ETF application updates and changes.  Some observers expect bitcoin prices to cross the $48,000 level in the coming weeks.  “The staging for this rally already started in the week beginning 10/23 when BTC managed to overcome the iron-beam resistance in the $30k area,” shared Julius de Kempenaer, senior technical analyst at StockCharts.com, in a note to CoinDesk. “On the weekly chart, the next expected level of resistance is around $48k, the peak set at the end of March 2022.”  “All in all, the trend for BTC is clearly up, with a first target around $48,000 and support near $38,000,” he added.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/06/bitcoin-surge-blasts-170m-in-bearish-shorts-as-btc-price-targets-48k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5eb924732df36e5537d22b5bcc27df6ac806ee54-5616x3159.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Options listed on Deribit suggest strengthening bias for ether call options.  Key derivatives market metrics show that sophisticated traders are turning their attention to ether [ETH] from the recent market standout, bitcoin [BTC], hinting at a potential outperformance of Ethereum's native token in the coming weeks.  Bitcoin has rallied over 60% this quarter, while ether, the supposedly deflationary currency with bond-like appeal and ESG-compliant label, has lagged big time, gaining 35%, CoinDesk data show. The performance gap is even wider in larger time frames, with bitcoin boasting a 163% gain on a year-to-date basis versus ether's 89%.  The chasm could narrow as money is now flowing into ether futures faster than bitcoin. The notional open interest, or the dollar-value locked in Chicago Mercantile Exchange's cash-settled ether futures contract, has increased by 30% to $711 million in the past five days, beating bitcoin's 19% growth to $4.9 billion, according to Velo Data. CME's ETH standard futures contract is sized at 50 ETH while its bitcoin counterpart is sized at 5 BTC.  The emerging positive spread between pricing for ether and bitcoin CME futures suggests the same. Per Reflexivity Research, the premium in ether futures relative to the spot index price was 5% higher than in bitcoin early this week.  ""The futures basis (which represents the difference between the spot and futures price) for Ethereum on CME is now trading at a 5% premium to that of bitcoin, now over 20%. In addition, we can see that open interest for ETH on the CME has now started to rise, after lagging the initial move up from bitcoin,"" Reflexivity Research said in a market update dated Dec. 5.  ""It may be too early to definitely say, but it appears 'tradfi' may be beginning to rotate into the ETH ETF trade after two months. This is something to continue monitoring for early signs of the market beginning to front-run a potential ETH ETF,"" Reflexivity Research said.  Meanwhile, in the options market listed on Deribit, traders have started to lean toward ether calls and bitcoin puts. A call option offers the right but not the obligation to purchase the underlying asset at a predetermined price at a later date. A call buyer is implicitly bullish on the market, while a put buy is bearish.  Per Amberdata, the one-month ether call-put skew, which measures the spread between implied volatility premium or demand for call and put options expiring in four weeks, has doubled to over 4% this month, a sign of strengthening call bias. Meanwhile, BTC's one-month skew has declined from 5% to 2%, a sign that traders are beginning to lean toward puts relative to calls.  Perhaps bitcoin may take a breather, allowing ether to play catch up in the weeks ahead.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/12/06/two-key-metrics-show-crypto-traders-turning-to-ether-from-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/641ff860507e70180d2e1e73b23fa8719e55941c-1023x575.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The biggest cryptocurrency in the world is enjoying a 150% increase this year as its price surged beyond $44,000 on Wednesday, marking the first time it had done so in over 18 months. The increase is indicative of the cryptocurrency’s continuous upswing, which is being supported by a number of elements such as a drop in interest rates and growing expectations over the possible approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the US. Related Reading: PEPE Inks 46% Weekly Gain – Can It Leap To The $1 Jackpot? Spot ETFs: Democratizing Bitcoin Investment With Lower Risks Supporters of the industry say that this new way to invest in bitcoin at spot prices instead of futures prices could make it easier for everyone to get into the cryptoverse while lowering some of the well-known risks that come with it. It’s possible that regulators will approve the first bitcoin spot ETF application as soon as next month, even though some crypto fund managers have recently won cases that made the chances of this happening better. “I think what the ETF means really is that Bitcoin is going mainstream, and that’s what people were waiting for,” Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier recently said. The fact that Bitcoin has recovered above the crucial price level highlights how resilient its upward momentum is, drawing interest from both seasoned investors and the larger cryptocurrency community. How High Can BTC Price Go? Given that news sources and financial analysts have taken notice of Bitcoin’s latest breakout above the psychologically critical $44,000 threshold, it is clear that the market is currently bullish biased. Bloomberg has made a bold prediction regarding the largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization when it entered the fray. The news website claims that Bitcoin’s increase above $42,000 marks the start of a new “crypto supercycle” rather than just a passing peak. According to this bullish prediction, Bitcoin will soar to values above an astounding $500,000 and become the cornerstone of a revolutionary new monetary paradigm that is already gaining support on Wall Street. Bitcoin slightly below the $44K level today. Chart: TradingView.com This prediction, which is in line with the increasing feeling of cryptocurrency fans, signals a paradigm change in conventional financial markets as Bitcoin keeps redefining the global economic scene and establishing its domination. Bitcoin’s Clear Path: $48K-$53K Sweet Spot For Upside – Analyst Based on technical price levels, particularly highs set in March 2022 and September 2021, Joel Kruger, market strategist at LMAX Group, believes that Bitcoin’s upward price momentum has a clear route forward until the region between $48,000 and $53,000. Between these two levels, Kruger identified a sweet spot where the route to the March 2022 high is remarkably free of major opposition. He stated: “There is a nice zone between those two levels with very little in the way of any meaningful resistance between the current price and that March 2022 high.” BTC moves past $44K today. Source: Coingecko According to market data, as of this writing, the price of Bitcoin is $44,020, up 5.5% over the previous day, and sustaining a 16% increase in the last week, data from Coingecko shows. As the market dynamic unfolds, all eyes are on Bitcoin, wondering if it will continue its bullish run and set its sights on the next significant milestone at $45,000.

The price is trading above $0.415 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $0.410 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could accelerate higher toward the $0.500 level or even $0.550. Cardano Price Starts Steady Increase After forming a base above the $0.3750 level, Cardano started a steady increase. There was a break above the $0.388 and $0.400 resistance levels, but ADA lagged momentum like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price even climbed above the $0.420 resistance. A high was formed near $0.4293 and the price is now consolidating gains. It is trading above the 23.3% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.3715 swing low to the $0.4293 high.

Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.4250 zone. The first resistance is near $0.432. The next key resistance might be $0.450. If there is a close above the $0.450 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.50 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.550. Are Dips Supported in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.432 resistance level, it could start a downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.4150 level. The next major support is near the $0.410 level and the trend line.

""'Inscriptions' are exploiting a vulnerability in Bitcoin Core to spam the blockchain,"" Luke Dashjr, a Bitcoin Core developer, posted on X Wednesday.  The spam Dashjr might have been alluding to is the number of transactions an ordinal generates.  On-chain data shows that there are over 260,000 unconfirmed transactions on the bitcoin blockchain, which in turn drives up the price to complete a transaction. Memory usage has also surged past the 300mb alloted, because of the larger size or inscription transactions versus regular transactions.  ""Bitcoin Core has, since 2013, allowed users to set a limit on the size of extra data in transactions they relay or mine (`-datacarriersize`). By obfuscating their data as program code, Inscriptions bypass this limit,"" Dashjr continued.  Back in May, when Ordinals first became popular, Binance had to temporarily pause bitcoin withdrawals after the network became overwhelmed and the number of unconfirmed transactions spiked to 400,000.  While Ordinals have their critics, like Dashjr, there's also an equally large camp that says they are an evolution of Bitcoin's blockchain.  Jason Fang, managing partner and co-founder at Bitcoin-heavy Sora Ventures, disagrees and argues that Bitcoin maintains its original consensus with innovations built on top, suggesting Satoshi's open-source approach encouraged experimentation.  ""Inscriptions are unstoppable,"" he said. ""This gives miners more fees and higher profits.""  At the depths of last year's crypto winter, many miners needed to be bailed out, being hit hard by a nasty trifecta of a low price of bitcoin, and increasing difficulty.  Miners, both private and publicly listed, faced margin calls and defaults as they struggled with debts up to $4 billion, used for building large facilities in North America, CoinDesk reported last year.  Fang explains part of the animosity towards inscriptions because many are upset due to the attention and profits garnered by Ordinals and other BRC-20 investments – and they missed out.

42409287,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFbvQ,1701843300,The Most Influential Folks in Crypto Regulations,"It's not that being a crypto regulatory reporter is ever really boring, but a lot has happened this year. Like, a LOT.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Who's doing what  The narrative  CoinDesk published its annual Most Influential list, recognizing the 50 individuals who have had the greatest impact on the crypto universe over the past 12 months.  Why it matters  This list recognizes developers, activists, and more than a few regulatory/legal folks. I wanted to create a quick list of folks who were solely tied to that last category.  Breaking it down  CoinDesk published its annual Most Influential list (it's not a ranking, except for the top 10 being maybe more influential than the other 40).  I wrote a few pieces (I had nothing to do with the art and didn't know about it when I wrote the pieces), as did my CoinDesk reg team colleagues, but I wanted to take a minute to recognize other influential figures who we may see pop up again.  This is not meant to be a comprehensive or objective list; just a recognition of some of the folks whose work I've paid attention to this year.  U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, AUSA Nicholas Roos and the rest of the prosecutors who ran the case against Sam Bankman-Fried – Obviously this group needs no introduction; just last month, they secured a conviction on seven different counts of fraud and conspiracy against FTX's Sam Bankman-Fried. During a press conference hours after the jury returned its verdict, Williams warned that his team would continue to go after any wrongdoing they found.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried – While Bankman-Fried himself hasn't seen much in a crypto regulatory sense this year, the aftermath of his companies' collapse still looms large over the broader industry and how both regulators and lawmakers engage with the sector.  New York Department of Financial Services Superintendent Adrienne Harris – NYDFS has been an influential overseer for crypto companies in New York for years, but Harris continues to build out rules for the space.  New York Attorney General Letitia James – The NYAG's office has been on the industry's radar since announcing its inquiry into Tether and Bitfinex, but it's brought a lot more suits this year that hint at how James' office might be looking at the space more broadly. Namely, its suits against Kucoin, Gemini and Digital Currency Group point to an effort to widen the NYAG's authority and oversight over crypto.  State regulators, including Joe Rotunda, Amanda Senn, Tung Chan, Clothilde Hewlett and many, many more – While federal regulators get most of the attention, state regulators have been very active the past few years, including this year, bringing actions against companies like Coinbase.  Ripple Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty – While Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was on CD's official list, I think it's worth noting the legal mind at Ripple who got the company to July's ruling.  Grayscale General Counsel Craig Salm and outside counsel Donald Verrilli Jr. – Ditto the Grayscale team, which successfully argued that an SEC rejection of its bitcoin exchange-traded fund conversion application was ""arbitrary.""  Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam and Commissioners Kristin Johnson, Caroline Pham, Christy Goldsmith-Romero and Summer Mersinger – The CFTC doesn't get tagged as a regulator bringing a lot of enforcement actions, but it kind of has, winning – for example – last year's Ooki DAO case.  Securities and Exchange Commission Commissioners Hester Peirce, Mark Uyeda, Caroline Crenshaw and Jaime Lizárraga – It's also worth remembering that while SEC staff can put together an enforcement action, a majority of commissioners need to agree before it actually gets filed.  CFTC and SEC staff – behind the scenes, these are the folks who do a lot of the work on enforcement actions, rulemaking, etc.  Stories you may have missed  Polygon Gave DraftKings Multimillion-Dollar Edge in Special Staking Relationship: DraftKings received millions of dollars worth of Polygon's MATIC tokens and earned much more through staking on the network than was disclosed, Danny Nelson reports.

Predicting the long-term trajectory remains elusive; achieving the $1 mark for PEPE requires an extraordinary surge from its present level, a feat that would position PEPE among the most lucrative meme coins in history. Meme tokens, lacking robust fundamentals and utility, consistently face the looming threat of being overshadowed by newer, trendier counterparts. Hence, while a modest increase to $0.0000020 in the near future appears plausible, surging beyond this may prove to be a formidable hurdle for the PEPE price. Related Reading: Cardano Profitability On The Rise: 1.7 Million Addresses Hit 2-Year High Mastering Timing In Meme Token Investments Investors are cautioned to tread carefully, as meme tokens like PEPE are prone to significant acquisitions by large investors, followed by subsequent dumping. Despite PEPE’s overall growth potential, substantial downturns are anticipated to be a recurring pattern. Recognizing the pivotal role that timing plays in the realm of cryptocurrency investments, it becomes evident that the significance of choosing the opportune moment cannot be emphasized enough. PEPEUSD currently trading at $0.000002 territory on the daily chart: TradingView.com The dynamic and often unpredictable nature of the crypto markets amplifies the impact of timing on investment outcomes, presenting a delicate balance between seizing potential opportunities and navigating potential risks. Meanwhile, data from Santiment sheds light on a significant milestone in the world of cryptocurrency. Specifically, the number of distinct addresses engaged in PEPE transfers has surged to an unprecedented all-time high, maintaining this elevated status for an impressive 25 consecutive days. This surge in unique addresses participating in PEPE transfers not only underscores a heightened level of activity but also suggests a sustained and robust interest in the PEPE cryptocurrency ecosystem. Source: Santiment PEPE’s Strong Chart Signals Anticipate Bullish Surge On another positive note, PEPE’s chart currently exudes strength, with indicators hinting at imminent gains. The convergence of PEPE’s 30-day moving average and its 200-day average is on the horizon, potentially signaling a ‘golden cross,’ a phenomenon often associated with breakouts. Simultaneously, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for PEPE hovers near 70, indicating sustained buying pressure that is likely to propel the altcoin’s value upward in the coming days. Related Reading: ORDI Rockets To Unprecedented Peaks Alongside Bitcoin’s $42,000 Breakthrough Supporting this optimistic perspective is the consistent elevation in trading volume, a clear indication that significant market players are actively accumulating PEPE. This heightened trading activity suggests a palpable anticipation among major investors, as they position themselves strategically to capitalize on anticipated future price surges. Despite a recent indication of sluggishness, PEPE remains resilient, boasting a 46% increase over the past week and a solid 20% rise over the last four weeks. PEPE price action in the last 24-hours. Source: Coingecko People were shocked when PEPE reached a market cap of $1 billion only one month after it came out. During this time, the meme coin rose to its all-time high of $0.000004354. Because of this, it became famous and was added to well-known cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance. Today, with a market cap surpassing $670 million, PEPE continues to attract attention, and its 24-hour trading volume, nearing $400 million, indicates the potential for further rallies in the days to come. As PEPE demonstrates notable gains, the prospect of reaching the $1 jackpot adds an element of anticipation. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

21100071,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561087,1701828011,NFT Scams: Types And How To Avoid Them,"NFT scams have quickly become a major concern in the digital asset realm, overshadowing the growing Non-Fungible Token world. They range from NFT scams on Instagram to complex NFT art frauds like the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Logan Paul’s NFT game. The risks are varied and significant. This guide explores the murky world of NFT fraud, highlighting various forms such as fake NFTs, NFT Ponzi schemes, and common OpenSea scams. Overview Of NFT Scams The Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) realm has opened a new digital frontier, bringing with it a surge in NFT scams, troubling both investors and enthusiasts. These scams, leveraging the novelty and complexity of NFTs, often catch even experienced participants off guard. NFT scams vary widely and continue to evolve, from simple phishing attempts to more complex Ponzi schemes. These fraudulent activities occur not only on lesser-known platforms but also on popular ones like OpenSea and in high-profile projects like the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The growth of social media further complicates matters, with platforms like Instagram becoming centers for NFT fraud. Understanding the range and mechanics of these scams is essential for anyone involved in the NFT space. The risks are numerous, from fake NFTs posing as legitimate digital art to Ponzi schemes presented as attractive investments, and phishing scams targeting valuable digital assets. True Or Not: NFTs Are A Scam? The question of whether NFTs are a scam is complex and requires a nuanced understanding of the NFT ecosystem. At the outset, it’s important to clarify that not all NFTs are scams. NFTs, by their very nature, are a legitimate technological innovation, providing a unique way to authenticate and trade digital assets on the blockchain. They have been utilized in various fields, from digital art and entertainment to real estate and identity verification. However, the burgeoning interest in NFTs has also attracted scammers looking to exploit the hype and the often limited understanding of the technology among the general public. This has led to a significant number of fraudulent schemes within the NFT space. Scams such as selling plagiarized digital art, creating fake NFT marketplaces, or promoting non-existent NFT projects are not uncommon. High-profile cases, like certain celebrity-endorsed NFT projects, have also raised suspicions and added to the skepticism. The key takeaway is that while NFTs as a concept are not a scam, the ecosystem has been marred by fraudulent activities that prey on the uninformed. The presence of scams does not invalidate the entire NFT space but serves as a cautionary tale about the need for due diligence and skepticism, especially in a field that is relatively new and rapidly evolving. As the NFT market continues to mature, it is hoped that better regulation and informed participation will reduce the prevalence of these scams. Types of NFT Scams The world of NFTs, while offering vast opportunities for creators and collectors, is also rife with various types of scams. Here’s a list of the most common NFT scams: Plagiarized NFTs / Fake NFTs One of the most common types of NFT scams involves the sale of plagiarized or fake NFTs. In these scams, fraudsters create and sell NFTs that are unauthorized copies of existing digital artworks. They may also create entirely fake NFTs, passing them off as valuable or rare digital assets. These scams exploit the NFT hype, especially in digital art, by taking advantage of buyers’ lack of knowledge in verifying NFT authenticity and originality. The decentralized, permissionless nature of blockchain, allowing anyone to mint NFTs, presents challenges in identifying these scams. It’s tough for buyers to distinguish between original and plagiarized NFTs without proper verification, leading to fraud and infringement on legitimate artists’ rights and profits. To avoid such scams, thoroughly research the creator’s background and the NFT’s provenance. While platforms and marketplaces are increasingly vetting creators and artworks, buyers must still perform due diligence before purchasing. NFT Ponzi Schemes NFT Ponzi schemes are another alarming trend in the realm of digital assets. In these schemes, early investors are promised high returns based on the investments of new participants, rather than legitimate business activities or profit. The structure inevitably collapses once there are not enough new investors, leading to significant losses for later investors. These schemes exploit the hype and speculative nature of the NFT market, often using aggressive marketing and false promises of guaranteed returns. They might be disguised as innovative NFT projects or exclusive investment opportunities in the digital art world. To protect yourself from NFT Ponzi schemes, be wary of projects that promise high returns with little to no risk, and always research the project’s fundamentals and the credibility of its creators. Rug Pull Scams Rug pull scams are particularly nefarious in the NFT space. In these scams, the developers of an NFT project hype up their offering to increase demand and price. However, once they accumulate a substantial amount of funds, they abandon the project and disappear with the investors’ money. This leaves investors with worthless NFTs and no way to recoup their investment. These scams are often associated with new projects that lack a track record or verifiable information about the team behind them. To avoid rug pulls, it’s essential to conduct thorough research on the NFT project, understand its utility, and verify the transparency and track record of the developers involved. Engaging with the community and looking for independent reviews can also provide valuable insights into the legitimacy of a project. Bidding NFT Scams Bidding NFT scams are a sophisticated form of fraud that occurs in the auction process of buying and selling NFTs. In these scams, fraudsters manipulate the bidding process to inflate the price of an NFT artificially. This is often done by using fake accounts to place high bids on the NFT, creating a false sense of demand and value. Unsuspecting buyers, believing the NFT to be more valuable than it actually is, are then tricked into placing even higher bids. Once the NFT is sold at the inflated price, the scammers withdraw, leaving the buyer with an asset worth significantly less than what they paid. To avoid falling victim to bidding scams, it’s crucial to research the bidding history of an NFT and be cautious of auctions where the price seems to escalate unusually quickly. It’s also advisable to verify the credibility of other bidders, if possible, and to understand the typical market value of similar NFTs. NFT Pump And Dumps NFT pump and dumps are similar in nature to their counterparts in the stock market. In these scams, a group of individuals or a single entity artificially inflates the value of an NFT or a series of NFTs through hype and misinformation. Scammers typically use social media to quickly spread rumors or exaggerated claims about an NFT’s potential value. After they pump up the price and attract other investors, they sell (or dump) their NFTs at a high price. This causes the value to plummet, leaving new investors with a devalued asset. To protect against pump and dump schemes, investors should be skeptical of NFTs that receive sudden and intense hype without tangible reasons or developments backing them. Independent research is crucial and should not rely solely on promotional materials or social media buzz to assess an NFT’s potential value. Phishing Scams Phishing scams are a prevalent issue in the NFT world, where scammers use deceptive methods to steal sensitive information, such as private keys or login credentials. These scams often occur through emails, social media messages, or fake websites that mimic legitimate NFT platforms. The scammers lure victims with the promise of exclusive NFT deals or access to rare digital assets, and once the victims enter their information on these fraudulent platforms, their digital wallets and the assets within them are compromised. To protect against phishing scams, always verify the authenticity of any communication or websites claiming to be from well-known NFT platforms. Be cautious of unsolicited offers and never share your private keys or sensitive account information. NFT Airdrop Or Giveaway Scams NFT airdrop or giveaway scams take advantage of users’ desire for free assets. Scammers promote fake airdrops or giveaways, claiming to distribute free NFTs or cryptocurrencies. To participate, users are often asked to perform certain tasks like sending a small amount of cryptocurrency, sharing private keys, or completing a form with personal information. Once the information is shared or the payment is made, the scammers disappear without delivering the promised NFTs. To avoid these scams, be wary of any offer that seems too good to be true, especially if it requires an upfront payment or sensitive information. Legitimate airdrops and giveaways usually do not require such actions. Website Scams Website scams in the NFT space typically involve the creation of fraudulent websites that imitate legitimate NFT marketplaces or projects. These websites might offer the sale of fake NFTs or pretend to offer services related to NFT trading. Unsuspecting users who transact on these sites may end up losing their funds or digital assets. These scams are sophisticated, with websites often appearing highly credible and professional. To avoid falling for website scams, always double-check the URL of the website you’re visiting and ensure it’s the official site. Look for signs of legitimacy, such as secure connections (https), reviews from trusted sources, and verified contact information. Be cautious of websites that appear from unsolicited emails or social media links, and consider using browser extensions that can help detect and block malicious websites. Most Common NFT Ponzi Schemes NFT Ponzi schemes are significant frauds in the digital asset space, disguising themselves as legitimate investment opportunities. They benefit early initiators at the expense of later participants, often promising high returns quickly, backed by convoluted or non-existent business models. A common NFT Ponzi scheme form involves platforms claiming to offer exclusive access to rare or high-value NFTs, asserting rapid value appreciation. Investors are urged to buy and recruit others, with the promise of earning from higher future sales. However, returns typically come from new participants’ investments. When new investors dwindle, the scheme collapses, leaving most at a loss. Another variant involves scammers creating NFT projects with elaborate backstories and promised future utility, attracting investors with high-quality artwork or supposed real-world asset tie-ins. The goal is to boost initial sales and trading volumes, after which the creators vanish, leaving investors with worthless tokens. To avoid NFT Ponzi schemes, thoroughly research any project or platform, especially those promising high returns. Seek transparent, realistic business models, and be cautious of projects reliant on recruiting new investors for profit. NFT Scams On Instagram Instagram’s large user base and visual focus have made it a breeding ground for NFT scams. Scammers exploit its popularity to commit various frauds, from fake NFT sales to phishing attacks. Instagram’s suitability for showcasing digital art allows scammers to use fake or hacked profiles to promote fraudulent NFT projects. A common NFT scam on Instagram features fraudsters posting digital art images, falsely advertising them as NFTs for sale. These posts often link to fake websites that prompt users to provide personal information or send cryptocurrency for nonexistent NFTs. Another method involves sending direct messages with offers to buy or invest in NFT projects, which are actually scams. Phishing attempts are rampant as well, directing users to fake websites that mimic popular NFT marketplaces or wallets. These sites steal login credentials, leading to loss of funds or NFTs from the victims’ actual wallets. Staying safe from NFT scams on Instagram requires a high degree of vigilance. Always verify the authenticity of any NFT sale or project promoted on the platform. Be skeptical of unsolicited offers received via direct messages and avoid clicking on suspicious links. Additionally, cross-reference NFT offerings with official websites or platforms, and never share personal or wallet information on unverified sites. NFT Art Scams And NFT Fraud The NFT art world, despite its creativity and innovation, is still vulnerable to an array of scams and fraudulent activities. Common among these are the sales of counterfeit digital artworks, theft of artist identities, and fraudulent investment schemes posing as legitimate NFT projects. OpenSea Scams OpenSea, a leading NFT marketplace, attracts various scams. Scammers often list counterfeit versions of popular NFTs for sale, deceiving buyers into purchasing fake or plagiarized art. Another prevalent scam is phishing, using links that mimic legitimate OpenSea websites to steal wallet information and funds. To counter these scams, OpenSea has taken measures like account verification and flagging suspicious activities. However, users need to stay alert. They should verify NFT authenticity, assess seller credibility, and use OpenSea’s official website to avoid these scams. Bored Ape Scam Scammers have also targeted the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection, known for its high-value and celebrity-endorsed NFTs. The high demand and significant media attention make it an attractive target. Scams related to Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) typically involve selling fake Bored Ape NFTs, phishing to steal these valuable NFTs from owners, and using the BAYC brand in fraudulent investment schemes to deceive victims. Collectors and investors looking to avoid Bored Ape scams should be wary of deals that appear overly attractive, verify the authenticity of Bored Ape NFTs via official channels, and stay alert to phishing attempts targeting BAYC NFT holders. Logan Paul NFT Game Scam Logan Paul, a well-known internet personality, and his associates face a class action lawsuit over their NFT project, CryptoZoo. Announced in September 2021, this NFT-based game claimed to be an “autonomous ecosystem” for trading virtual exotic animals. The lawsuit alleges that Paul’s team executed a rug pull, promoting CryptoZoo to his followers who were largely unfamiliar with digital currencies. This led to a significant number of them buying these NFTs. Further claims state that the game was non-functional or nonexistent, and the defendants manipulated the market for Zoo Tokens. After selling all their NFTs, they allegedly transferred the funds to their controlled wallets. Further accusations include that the game did not work or never existed, and that the defendants manipulated the digital currency market for Zoo Tokens to their advantage. After completing the sale of all their NFTs, the defendants allegedly transferred the money to wallets controlled by themselves. Avoiding NFT Scams: Best Practices Here are some essential tips to help you stay safe in the world of NFTs: Do Your Research: Ensure you conduct thorough research on the project, its creators, and the selling platform before investing in any NFT. Look for reviews, community feedback, and the track record of the creators. Verify Authenticity And Provenance: Confirm the authenticity of the NFT you’re interested in to ensure it’s not a counterfeit. Check the item’s history and originality, which can be verified on the blockchain. Use Reputable Platforms: Stick to well-known and reputable NFT marketplaces that have measures in place to prevent scams. These platforms often have verification processes for sellers and their NFTs. Be Wary of Unsolicited Offers: Exercise caution with unsolicited offers that come through email, social media, or direct messages, particularly if they promise high returns or exclusive opportunities. Secure Your Digital Wallet: Use a secure and reputable digital wallet to store your NFTs. Protect your wallet’s private keys and make sure never to share them with anyone. Watch Out For Phishing Attempts: Be vigilant about phishing scams. Always check the URL of a website to ensure it’s legitimate and be cautious about clicking on links in emails or social media messages. Avoid Overhyped Projects: Approach NFT projects surrounded by excessive hype with skepticism, particularly those lacking substantial and verifiable information. Stay Informed About Scam Trends: Keep yourself updated on the latest scam trends in the NFT space. Knowledge about how scammers operate can be your best defense.

42409283,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcFbs7,1701824602,This Bitcoin Rally Feels Different. FOMO and YOLO Seem to Be Back,"About two years ago, crypto prices topped out. Bitcoin [BTC] almost got to $70,000. Then things got bad, then they got worse and then they got cataclysmic. BTC sank toward $15,000 in the aftermath of FTX's blow-up.  It was ugly. You probably remember!  Prices have rebounded throughout 2023, but much of it felt like hard-won gains – rallies were quickly followed by setbacks. By mid-October, bitcoin was around $27,000.  And then the market caught fire, fueled by optimism over bitcoin ETFs and sinking interest rates. Bitcoin just briefly touched $45,000 on Coinbase. It had only just managed to surpass $40,000 a few days ago, a level last seen in early 2022.  Read more: Here's Why Bitcoin's Famed Bull-Market Pullbacks Have Been Elusive During the Recent Price Surge  A crypto-skeptic friend texted me Tuesday saying he was about to buy more bitcoin. A colleague says he's hearing from people wondering about crypto. Will this last? Is crypto making a move toward mainstream territory again?  To the disappointment of my father, who has asked me for forecasts throughout my two-decade career covering markets and finance, I have no idea. But I know it's been two years since the mood in crypto markets felt this ebullient – before the collapses of Celsius, Voyager, Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Genesis …  FOMO (you know, ""fear of missing out"") maybe mixed with a dose of YOLO (""you only live one"") seems to be back.  Wall Street is coming to crypto  How things got this enthusiastic is not hard to fathom. It really is a big deal that Wall Street heavyweights BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton are trying to list bitcoin ETFs in the U.S.  Click here to read CoinDesk's Most Influential list for 2023, a series of 50 profiles of key people in crypto, including BlackRock's Larry Fink and Franklin Templeton's Jenny Johnson.  Anyone with a plain vanilla brokerage account should be able to buy these products, if they're approved by regulators – and all signs point to approval being likely soon. That's easier and probably more realistic for regular Americans than setting up a Coinbase account or, heaven forbid, figuring out how a decentralized exchange or MetaMask work.  So, BlackRock, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton's sales and marketing heft looks poised to be behind bitcoin ETFs. It's not crazy to think that will bring a lot of money into crypto. Whether that creates a sustainable rally is up for debate.  Here's what else is on my mind:  A ROCKY DEBUT: After FTX fell apart, many folks wondered if something bad was going to happen to its bigger rival, Binance. U.S. regulators and law enforcement seemed to be circling. We got our answer recently: The crypto exchange agreed to pay $4.3 billion to settle several U.S. investigations. Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao stepped down as CEO. For all the angst in the run-up to this, though, the industry has taken it in stride. Anyway, CZ's replacement, Richard Teng, just had his first big public interview, and it was not a smooth debut, according to CoinDesk's Helene Braun. He came across as evasive. The company never says where it's based, and Teng was opaque about that and other issues. The question is whether this matters. Maybe traders don't care if the world's biggest crypto exchange is evasive?  CRYPTO'S BEST CORRELATION: It's become a cliché: Elon Musk says or does something, and it moves the price of dogecoin (DOGE), the meme coin he's long loved. It just happened again.

Inside sources from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicate that Bloomberg’s initial 90% chance prediction of approval has now surged beyond 99%. This development has heightened the excitement surrounding this investment vehicle, which has the potential to bring substantial inflows of capital into the Bitcoin market and further amplify its year-to-date gains of over 153%. Market Sentiment Soars As Bitcoin ETF Approval Probability Surpasses 99% Andrew, an SEC insider, shared an update on X (formerly Twitter), stating that the 99% probability of a Spot Bitcoin ETF being approved is no longer deemed high enough. While acknowledging that nothing is ever certain, the source emphasized that the current likelihood of approval surpasses the 99% estimate from the previous week. The sentiment in the market is clearly reflected in the price movement of Bitcoin, as it continues to establish new yearly highs and display unwavering bullish momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Says Solana At Risk Of Pullback: Here Is The Target Currently trading at $42,900, Bitcoin recently reached a fresh annual peak of $43,400 on Tuesday. Over the past 24 hours, the largest cryptocurrency has surged by 4%, and it has witnessed a remarkable increase of over 14% in the past seven days. It is worth noting that the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF being approved has captured the attention of investors and industry participants alike. If approved, the ETF would provide a regulated and accessible investment vehicle for institutional and retail investors, potentially bringing significant liquidity to the cryptocurrency market. The spike in approval forecasts to over 99% has further fueled optimism that this milestone decision is imminent. While nothing can be guaranteed, the growing confidence in Bitcoin ETF approval and the cryptocurrency’s impressive price performance underscores the potential for a significant positive impact on the market. As the final deadline approaches, market participants eagerly await the SEC’s decision, anticipating a potential game-changer for the Bitcoin ecosystem and its ongoing growth. BTC Faces Crucial Range High Resistance Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital has shed light on Bitcoin’s recent price action, emphasizing the significance of key support and resistance levels within a specific price range. In late November, Rekt Capital identified a range between $36,120 and $43,200, highlighting the importance of the lower boundary for a potential upward move. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Set To Establish A New Era For Shibarium Burns Bitcoin successfully tested and held the range’s lower boundary as support, resulting in a substantial rally in recent days. The primary objective now, according to Rekt, is to revisit the upper boundary, known as the black $43,900 range high resistance, as seen in the chart below. Rekt Capital underscores the importance of the black Range High resistance as a crucial reference point for Bitcoin’s price. During the parabolic phase of the 2021 Bull Market, Bitcoin managed to break above this level relatively easily. On two occasions, the cryptocurrency surged beyond the black level, with the first instance followed by a retest of the level as a new support, leading to further upward momentum. The second instance occurred later in the year when Bitcoin successfully retested the black level as short-term support before continuing its ascent. However, late in 2021, Bitcoin lost the black level as support (first red circle from the left) and experienced a fake breakout above it, subsequently entering a multi-week downtrend. Rekt Capital highlights that Bitcoin’s historical performance suggests the cryptocurrency needs to successfully retest the black $43,900 level as support to pave the way for further upward movement.

The higher the AUM, the less extreme the premiums should be, BCHG appears to be bucking that thesis as a top 5 single-asset Grayscale fund. I wouldn't buy BCHG unless you feel really strongly that BCH is going much higher. But if you take that view, you may do better with a crypto IRA instead. One of the funny internet memes that has become popular in the last few years is a screengrab of a scene from the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (KnowYourMeme) Here we go again. When properly used, the meme is meant to convey fatigue from the perspective of someone who is having to fight a familiar battle once again. This sentiment is how I currently feel about Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust ( BCHG ). If you've been a latecomer to the Grayscale funds, or if this is your first cycle with exposure to crypto, there's a chance you only remember these funds trading at deep discounts. But let me tell you, before Grayscale funds traded at silly discounts, they traded at preposterously silly premiums. In fact, the first time I covered the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) for Seeking Alpha, it was a warning for investors to be mindful of GBTC's then 30% premium. Now that bulls are back in control of the crypto market, we're starting to see the funds trading at premiums again. Some of those premiums are once again getting preposterously silly: Data by YCharts The chart above is showing the NAV premium for the Grayscale Filecoin Trust ( FILG ). That premium is currently 681%. The premium has nearly tripled since I covered FILG in June 2022. The price of the fund shares have actually doubled even though FileCoin ( FIL-USD ) itself is down 35% in the last 18 months. The biggest problem here is fund illiquidity. FILG has about a half a million dollars in AUM. Which is a small fraction of the AUM of Grayscale Solana Trust ( GSOL ) which currently trades at about a 300% premium to net asset value. The higher up we go in AUM, the less extreme these premiums should be. Hence, my concern when I see the 40-50% premium we're currently seeing in Grayscale's Bitcoin Cash Trust. Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust Similar to how Grayscale's other single-asset funds work, Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) fund is designed to simply hold BCH under custody with Coinbase ( COIN ) through cold storage. The inception date of the fund was March 1st, 2018 and the fund's shares began trading on secondary in August of 2020. Ticker: BCHG AUM: $75 million Shares Outstanding: 34.8 million BCH per Share: 0.00865789 Management Fee: 2.5% It's a pretty straightforward fund objective. BCHG intends to track the performance of the crypto asset BCH. Given the amount of BCH per share, which changes daily, each share should theoretically track with the price of BCH. As of article submission, that price is approximately $250 per coin. Thus, BCHG shares have a little over $2 in BCH allocated per share yet the fund shares closed above $3 as of December 5th, 2023. There is certainly a case to be made for going long Bitcoin Cash before a new crypto bull really takes off. I've covered BCH for Seeking Alpha a couple of times in the past and I'll get into updated thoughts on the coin itself later in the article. However, even if one likes BCH, there is a very different fundamental setup for BCHG at this point in time. Like several of the other trusts that have traded at preposterous premiums in the past, so too have BCHG shares. BCHG NAV Ratio (CoinGlass) The Bitcoin Cash fund has one of the more egregious NAV rate histories of the early Grayscale funds. At one point in late 2020, BCHG traded at a 1,800% premium to the value of the underlying assets. While it isn't trading a premium that large now, there is no question it's overvalued given the 43% premium to NAV given its position as a top 5 Grayscale single asset fund by AUM: Grayscale Fund Share Value Share Price NAV Rate GBTC $39.20 $34.99 -10.74% Ethereum ( ETHE ) $21.70 $18.47 -14.87% Ethereum Classic ( ETCG ) $16.68 $11.94 -28.40% Litecoin ( LTCN ) $6.31 $9.41 49.11% BCHG $2.18 $3.12 43.37% Source: Grayscale, Google Finance, Author Calculations From a NAV rate standpoint, what we're currently seeing in Grayscale's Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash funds are a sign the markets may be getting out of hand. Why Is This Happening Again? In my view, there are a few reasons why buyers may be willing to pay a premium for these shares: They're simply not sophisticated investors and haven't done the math on the premium. They believe the underlying asset is going much higher and are okay with paying a premium if the value of the shares catches up and continues appreciating. Even with the high management fee, a modest premium is still theoretically viable so long as the shares are traded in a tax-advantaged account. I can't reason away number 1. Number 3 does make some sense but not at a 43% premium. Number 2 is the one that I can address further. I would caution speculators who are buying BCHG at a premium who believe there will be a greater fool to sell to at a higher price. Unlike during the last crypto bull run, there are now many different ways to invest in crypto and crypto proxies through tax advantaged accounts. Investors can open crypto IRAs through companies like iTrustCapital, Choice by Kingdom Trust, and Alto. The point is, Grayscale is no longer the only game in town for crypto investment. So I question the logic in premium rates this high. Fade BCHG, Buy Bitcoin Cash? Of course, if you think BCH is going much higher than the current $250 price per coin, then buying BCHG at $3 could theoretically make sense. Bitcoiners aren't going to like this, but you could make the case that BCH is interesting at this point in time. Bitcoin Cash Active Addresses (IntoTheBlock) What has been a fairly lackluster daily active address figure for Bitcoin Cash compared to Bitcoin has admittedly gotten a bit more interesting in recent months. After DAUs fell to multi-year lows during crypto winter, the trend has started to turn around: Date Active Addresses 2017-12-18 264,262 2023-10-23 224,393 2023-12-04 209,444 2017-12-25 201,835 2023-10-09 200,208 Source: IntoTheBlock Furthermore, the outliers are very interesting. Going back the last 6 years, 3 of the top 5 days for active addresses on Bitcoin Cash have come in the last two months. Investor Takeaways Aside from a handful of altcoins that have staged magnificent rallies in the second half of 2023, Bitcoin continues to eat the crypto market. Bitcoin dominance has remained near multi-year highs as the markets speculate on a spot ETF approval in the coming weeks/months. You could certainly sell me on Bitcoin Cash being an interesting trade down here, but I simply can't justify chasing the Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust at a 43% premium. If you're looking to invest in BCH while minimizing taxes on trades, I would consider looking into a crypto-focused IRA before buying Grayscale funds at such large premiums.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETC,BCH | BUSINESS | ETC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4656172-grayscale-bitcoin-cash-trust-here-we-go-again?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21098419.jpeg

Bitcoin Whales Dormant Since 10+ Years Ago Are Waking Up In a new CryptoQuant Quicktake post, analyst Maartunn has talked about a pattern forming in Bitcoin that looks similar to what happened back in 2021, during the last bull run The indicator of interest here is the amount of Bitcoin being moved on the blockchain that was dormant since at least ten years ago before the transaction took place. Ten years is naturally a very long stretch of time, so whenever wallets holding BTC this old activate again, it’s always something that ignites discussion in the community.

A lot of this supply would never be involved in transactions again, because of the wallets carrying them being lost to the point that they can’t be rediscovered by any means possible. Some of the supply may simply be forgotten about, rather than lost, and might get found once more. When this happens, the finder (who may or may not be the original owner of the coins) could decide to shift the coins immediately, cashing in on them by selling, or perhaps, they may just decide to hold off a bit more, finding the appropriate price timing to offload the Bitcoin. The below chart notes the instances where coins dormant since 10 years ago showed some movement during the past few years. Looks like these old coins have moved again recently | Source: CryptoQuant From the graph, it’s visible that the Bitcoin bull run back during the first half of 2021 saw many instances where large amounts of such dormant BTC stacks broke their silence. Some of these whales who woke up could have been those who remembered their old BTC wallets after seeing the cryptocurrency making waves on the news, while others might have been those who had already rediscovered their old coins a while back, but had since been waiting for this profitable selling opportunity. The 10 years old coins had mostly remained dormant in the second half of the bull run and the 2022 bear market, making only a few large moves. Among these, two in particular were quite interesting, as they coincided with bottoms in the asset’s price. Maartunn has highlighted these instances in the chart. According to the analyst, it’s possible that these were whales who were panic selling after seeing the cryptocurrency decline to the lows. As is apparent from the chart, dormant whale activity has heated up once again recently. “Looking at the past few months, there have been more than 13 similar transactions. It’s striking that this is happening during the uptrend, as Bitcoin is rising due to news about the emerging ETF,” notes Maartunn. The latest of these transactions was just yesterday, when a 1,000 BTC stack more than 10 years old became involved in a move. In a post on X, the same analyst has explained that this whale is a retired miner, as many of the inputs that their wallet received came directly from the network’s block reward.
