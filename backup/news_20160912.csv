42399310,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbismT,1473718210,Blockchain Support Bill Passes Vote in US Congress,"The US House of Representatives has passed a non-binding resolution calling for a national technology innovation policy that includes supportive language for digital currencies and blockchain technology.  Introduced  in July, the resolution calls on the US government to craft a national policy for technology, with specific mentions for digital currencies and blockchain. The bill was written by Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger, with Representative Tony Cardenas from California sponsoring.  The resolution passed by a voice vote following statements from backers late this afternoon. Though non-binding, the measure is perhaps the most significant to emerge from Congress to date on the subject of digital currencies and blockchain tech.  The resolution emerged months after the House Committee on Energy and Commerce discussed the technology, and comments from supporters on the debate floor indicated that there was genuine interest in the issue among House members.  Rep. Michael Burgess, a Republican from Texas, said at the hearing:  ""There’s no doubt that blockchain innovations are on the cutting edge today.""  What remains to be seen is whether the next session of Congress, which will meet after this November's US elections, will take up a more substantive bill focused specifically on bitcoin and blockchain.  However, the bipartisan nature of today's resolution suggests that a bill could be put forward in the next year in either the House or the Senate.

42399309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbisjW,1473715831,"In Race for Bitcoin Mining Profits, Fortune Favors the Old","New research has found that unless the price of bitcoin goes up, there will be little room for new miners to compete.  In ""Minting Money With Megawatts"", released this September, Sveinn Valfells of Flux, Ltd and Jón Helgi Egilsson of the University of Iceland conduct a broad analysis of the health of transaction processing on the open public blockchain, ultimately finding that the network could be headed toward further consolidation and centralization.  Once a hobby for tech-enthusiasts, the aim of the study was to determine the profitability of bitcoin mining following July's halving, a scheduled network change at which the rewards given to bitcoin miners dropped from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC.  Notably, the researchers found that it is now only possible for new miners to profit when the price of bitcoin is above $600, a figure that was nearly double what it was before the halving.  To determine this figure, the researchers analyzed whether a new mining operation could remain small while still generating profit.  Profitability gap  Because the addition of new hashrate to the network alters how hard it is to generate the reward, the researchers also analyzed how much hashrate could sustainably be added to the network.  In this case, new miners can only add about 16% before difficulty increases would make them unprofitable. This worries the researchers, as this narrow gap for profitability doesn't impact incumbents nearly as much as new miners.  The writers explain that legacy miners have already made a capital investment to build out their mining operation. Therefore, a reduction in revenue only becomes a concern if their operational costs are greater than the amount of money they're bringing in.  They write:  ""Existing miners have no reason to turn off their equipment even after the block reward has halved to 12.5 BTC … incumbents enjoy a clear advantage over new entrants.""  While a new miner has to worry about the cost of both the new hardware they’ve purchased as well as their operational costs, legacy miners only need to worry about the latter.  This gives legacy miners the ability to operate in a low-margin environment that might not support a new miner.  Spectre of centralization  In sum, the researchers view this development as problematic because it could ultimately lead to further consolidation by incumbents, which the authors believe could open the network to consolidation and attack.  If new miners can't participate in the network, the larger operations become an increasingly larger part of the total network, creating the opportunity for mining operations to do harm to the network.  Fortunately, the researchers believe that Moore’s Law may be able to prevent this problem.  Because electricity is one of the biggest costs for any bitcoin miner, if hardware power efficiency can double every three years, the researchers predict the minimum required price for new entrant profitability could drop to $530.  This increase in power efficiency would also make it possible for the network to support an additional 25% of hashrate before difficulty made new miners unprofitable, rather than the 16% it currently can handle.  Should Moore’s Law continue beyond just the next doubling of power efficiency, it appears that there might be a market for new entrants for some time.

42399305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbisdc,1473695150,EU's Top Cop Launches Digital Currency Working Group,"Europol, the European Union's top law enforcement agency, has co-founded a new working group dedicated to digital currencies.  The initiative is being co-led by Interpol, the intergovernmental organization focused on law enforcement issues, and the Basel Institute on Governance, a non-profit group focused on financial crimes in the public and private sectors.  The working group, according to an announcement last week, will involve the organization of collaborative workshops and a global network comprised of subject matter experts.  Europol said in a statement:  ""Internet technologies become continuously more advanced, and so do the ways in which criminals utilize them for their illicit and illegal activities. Among these technologies, digital currencies are already transforming the criminal underworld.""  Europol and Interpol have spent much of the last year collaborating on digital currency issues, a partnership that has seen the two groups organize conferences and training sessions directed at global law enforcement representatives.  More recently, Europol inked a deal with blockchain startup Chainalysis in a bid to expand its capacity for tracking digital currency transactions.

42399360,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbishY,1473683467,Funding Question Looms for R3 Ahead of London Meeting,"New York-based blockchain startup R3CEV is currently in negotiations to raise a Series A funding round, people familiar with the group's plans have told CoinDesk.  The source, who couldn’t speak on the record due to the sensitivity of the topic, said that R3 had been given a $200m pre-valuation according to an independent report carried out by Ernst & Young as part of the consortium's contract with its members.  The $200m figure relates to a valuation prior to any investment made by outside investors, which could significantly increase the group’s valuation.  Asked about the reports, R3's managing director Charley Cooper said the group ""doesn't talk about our funding process publicly"".  Cooper did confirm the group is holding a meeting of its partners in London on Tuesday and admitted that there was potential for funding to become a topic of conversation, though it is not an official item on the program.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It is not formally on the agenda [but] will different people bring it up? It’s obviously possible.""  Along with potential discussions about funding, the meeting this week will also address a number of other important issues for R3’s clients including its research work and its newly revealed Concord platform.  The group's product team will also discuss various proof of concepts and use cases which are currently in the incubation stage and which may end up being spun into products.  Valuing innovation  Of course, putting a valuation on blockchain-based companies is difficult given the nascent nature of the technology.  While Cooper would not be drawn on any potential fundraising efforts or a specific valuation, he did say that unlike a lot of tech startups, R3 offers much that could make it worthy of investor interest.  ""We are not three guys in a garage, we are not a Silicon Valley startup... We are 80 people with offices in eight cities, 66 clients, already developed a prototype version of our distributed ledger platform, we already have got products in design phase,"" he said.  R3 currently has 66 clients, it's most recent member South America's biggest stock exchange BM&F Bovespa, based in Brazil — signing up last week.  So far, 35 of those have confirmed to attend the London meetup, one of a series of meetings the groups holds in different locations around the globe during the year, Cooper said.  Path forward  Still, the source said that the decision to raise funds had not yet been finalized, and that it could always extend the advisory services agreement under which it currently operates with its partners.  It is unclear exactly what any funding would be used for as it is understood that R3 is generating revenue from its partners. Funding could, however, allow the consortium to expand at an even faster rate than they are already depending on how ambitious the group’s plans are.  At least some of the money would likely be invested in hiring more talent the source revealed. Because R3 has expanded to add clients in locations in all corners of the globe, it needs to hire more people in specific locations.  In the last 12 months, the group has grown from just eight employees to 80 with offices now spread across the globe. Along with its headquarters in New York, the company has established presences in San Francisco, London, Japan, Zurich, Singapore, Seoul and Sydney.  As well as its official operations, R3 also has remote employees who operate independently from locations spread across the globe.  This distributed workflow means the group does not have to invest heavily in servers, buildings or facilities, meaning it should not need huge amounts of capital, Cooper said.  New updates  The meeting comes at a time when R3 has been more vocal about its work in the face of escalating announcements from similar consortium efforts.  For example, R3 recently filed a patent for its own distributed ledger technology platform, which it is building in collaboration with the banks and financial institutions. The platform, called Concord, bears similarity to public blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum but differs in one significant aspect, transactions are not stored publicly.  While many in the industry face concerns over finding sufficiently qualified candidates, Cooper says this is not something that R3 has faced.  ""Because we have created this center of gravity in the financial services industry and we have so many clients looking to develop we’ve ended up becoming the first de facto stop from anyone who wants to work in this space seeking a job,"" he said.  Also on the agenda is the topic of regulation, one that could be of increasing concern as R3 looks to move from POCs to real-world applications.  Cooper concluded:  ""We spend time with our legal and regulatory folks talking about what we have learned from various different regulators around the world as well as what regulators are working with us or in our lab and running experiments.""
