42397289,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCDe,1382119218,Pay for groceries with bitcoin via eGifter's new Walmart giftcard,"The lives of people attempting to live solely on bitcoin just got much easier, at least in the US. 'Social' gift card seller eGifter has started selling cards for retail behemoth Walmart.  eGifter began accepting bitcoin at the beginning of October 2013, and in doing so opened up a new universe of mainstream purchasing options. The company already sells gift cards for over 100 retail outlets in a wide range of categories, including well-known brands like Barnes & Noble, Land's End, Home Depot and CVS Pharmacy.  Even among people who have never set foot in one of their stores, Walmart is famous for selling pretty much everything at discount prices. Perhaps most significantly, bitcoin users will now be able to pay for groceries and gasoline in their favorite currency.  Membership-based retail warehouse Sam's Club (a Walmart subsidiary) also accepts Walmart gift cards as payment, increasing options even further.  Buying gift cards with bitcoin for yourself and others has been around for a short while already, after competitor Gyft partnered with BitPay in May 2013 to sell cards for a range of stores including clothing and fast food, as well as Amazon.  [post-quote]  Other indirect payment options include bitcoincodes.com, which exchanges bitcoin for access to various online services like XBox Live, Playstation Network, Nintendo and AirVPN. Australian residents can use local service Bitcoin Gift Cards to buy, among other things, fuel and home supplies.  The ability to purchase daily necessities with bitcoin has been something of a holy grail for digital currency enthusiasts, and a lack of such options is often used by cryptocurrency naysayers to claim bitcoin isn't mainstream enough for mass acceptance.  eGifter users can send gift cards and vouchers for over 100 US-based brands to others attached to e-cards and video messages. The recipient can either print off the coupon number or barcode, or display it on a smartphone using eGifter's iOS or Android apps.  The company uses Coinbase to process transactions and does not charge any extra fees or markups to pay with bitcoin.  Logging into eGifter with Facebook, Google+ or LinkedIn allows users to import their contact lists to choose recipients. If you prefer not to link your social networks to other sites, it also allows you to sign up and send gift cards with email addresses only. Users can also purchase cards in groups with each contributor using different payment options, if they wish.  While electronic gift cards occasionally need to be explained to store employees, reddit users have reported no problems making purchases with the Walmart cards purchased with bitcoin via eGifter.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/10/18/pay-for-groceries-with-bitcoin-via-egifters-new-walmart-giftcard,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7050849fdcbe45133df0fedc0c648c1bf7c61f54-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397288,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCOT,1382106612,"Chinese whispers, Chinese hackers and Chinese goats","That which does not kill me...  The law of unintended effects sometimes seems as much a part of the universe as anything Newton or Einstein could cook up. The landing of Apollo 11 on the moon - the triumph of manned space exploration - signalled the start of disillusionment with the whole idea. We haven’t been out of Earth orbit since the programme was shut down early. Victory in World War II was the shove that pushed Britain off global superpower status. And the Silk Road shutdown - here mourned in a rather fine Boyz II Men parody - may be the turning point that sees bitcoin get taken seriously.    One reason is that the bitcoin price bounced back within a few days, after an initial $20 or so wobble, persuading some that it’s not just a black market medium of exchange. Another is that Baidu, the Chinese Google, started to accept the cryptocurrency while everyone was still mulling over Dread Pirate Roberts’ demise. Inspired timing for an announcement replete with implications: if you’re a flagship Chinese company, you’ve got a pretty shrewd idea whether radical moves will be acceptable to the government.      There’s certainly an uptick in positive commentary from general-interest publications such as the New Statesman and National Geographic - establishment-friendly organs with a serious bent. And economists are now predicting bitcoin’s banning not because it’s too shaky but because it works too well to be ignored by governments - although how exactly you shut down a piece of open-source software is never made clear.      What’s actually happening, John Law suspects, is that bitcoin is showing staying power despite everything that’s happened to it. One of the big differences between bitcoin and gold is that gold has been around as a valuable material for at least 7,000 years, while bitcoin is around five years old. Even given those are Internet years - roughly equivalent to dog years, where things go by seven times quicker - that’s a bit of a gap to make up. But each seismic upset that bitcoin survives - and the US government trying to ban it would be a biggie - will make it look more durable, more serious and more like something your granny would use.      But if you still want something to chew on, check out blockchain.info’s graph of the estimated cost of mining. The last break-even point was at the start of July, since when it’s become drastically more expensive to make a bitcoin than it’s worth (at least with GPU mining). GPU mining now costs nearly a thousand dollars in electricity and network outlay to mine just one bitcoin. ASICs perform far better, but will the same thing happen and their makers eventually go bust? Will the price of bitcoin rise as mining stops and scarcity kicks in?      If it wasn’t for the fact it’s been charted, this would be uncharted territory.    Breaking Baidu  Which is peculiarly apt, as the major Chinese bitcoin exchange, BTC China, has just survived one of the most intense DDoS attacks on record. BTC China, the third largest bitcoin exchange in the world, had to soak up 100 gigabits of malevolent traffic a second - which caused, unsurprisingly some delays and failures on the site. The good news is that it didn’t fail, and after a while the attackers gave up and went home.  Two questions: how and why? The how is quite interesting: the attackers infect a number of computers with malware that waits for commands and then sends out packets to the target as fast as possible. Get enough computers on fast enough internet connections, and you can generate more network traffic than Google, all triggered from a laptop in an Internet cafe somewhere.  The why is more interesting: a lot of these attacks are seemingly pointless. John Law has been in the operations room of a large company when a DDoS hit, and nobody had the faintest idea why they’d been targeted. The best anyone could come up with was that as an organisation with a high profile public website, the attackers were testing out their weaponry agtainst a worthy target before deploying it against their real quarry. (They didn't win, by the way; there are lots of anti-DDoS techniques, more than are publically discussed for reasons that should be obvious.)  Sometimes, the reason is blackmail: pay us a ransom, or we’ll take your business down. Sometimes it’s political, especially when a company does something to annoy the radical hacktivists out there. Sometimes it’s just for bragging rights among other hackers: showing off isn’t exactly unknown. But with bitcoin? It could have been an attempt to shake confidence in bitcoin, thus driving the price down: the attackers would then nip in and buy at an advantageous price, offloading their loot when the price recovers.  That doesn’t seem to be the case here: the attack was unsuccessful, and while it did command an impressive amount of bandwidth, it would have been unlikely to last long enough to make a difference even if it had shut down the exchange. But this remains one of the few ways for the unscrupulous to manipulate the bitcoin market, so expect it to happen again.    One final conspiracy-tinged theory is left. There’s been gossip among security types for a while that the Chinese government is having trouble keeping its tame army of cyberwarfare hackers in line and they’re prone to rather too much private venture activity for comfort. With bitcoin getting the Baidu seal of approval, this may have been too much of a temptation to resist. It could even have been a shot across the bows of Baidu itself - acts of vandalism in one of the most intensively monitored Internet infrastructures in the world will not go unnoticed.    This week’s worst idea ever    The idea has the hazy, feel-good techno-boosterism that comes from inhaling Silicon Valley’s rarefied air too deeply. Glance at a tin of peas in a shop and - wham - you’ve bought it. Your Google Glass, armed with the GlassPay app, can scan the barcode, interrogate the shop’s pricing database, add the result to your total, and when you’re done, the magic of bitcoin means you can walk out of the shop without all that tedious money or card nonsense.      Which presupposes a few facts. First, that you’ll be seen dead in public wearing Google Glass. Second, that you see buying peas as a cultural experience. Third, that a shop’s going to be happy having people walk in, pick up goods and walk out again with no other interaction. Fourth, that in the absence of a printed receipt or other proof of purchase, that using an anonymous payment method is going to be a good idea if you need to take your peas back and exchange them for peacock’s tongues in aspic. Which, if you’re the sort of person who thinks wearing Google Glass is socially acceptable, is the sort of thing you’re going to be doing.      There are answers to some of those objections: one is that you don’t actually pick up the goods as you buy them, but just look at pictures of them or examples of them behind glass, picking up your haul after the shop has selected them for you and ascertained you’ve actually paid - much like Argos [Argos is a catalogue-based retailer in the UK - Ed]. Or there are ‘greeters’ (aka store guards) at the door to stop you if you’ve been seen not glancing quite correctly.      None of which seems much of an advance on just taking your stuff to the counter, having the nice man or nice woman put your stuff in a bag for you, and handing over a twenty quid note. You might even have a pleasant chat while you’re at it, crack a joke, maybe even ask them out for a drink. That’s a real cultural experience.      Not everything is cool just because it’s been touched by bitcoin. And absolutely nothing is cool if it involves Google Glass.      However, as a special treat for reading this far, here is something that is entirely cool - a completely incomprehensible Chinese infographic explaining bitcoin with the help of pizza, guns, socks and a goat.      No charge.    John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler. Having reformed the French economy, invented paper currency, state banks, the Mississippi Bubble and other ideas essential to modern economics, he took three hundred years off in a small cottage outside Bude.

42397276,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCBg,1382095849,Silk Road case could set bitcoin legal precedent against self-incrimination,"Now that an all-star attorney has been selected for the Silk Road operator's defense, the big show moves to key disclosure laws and whether the Silk Road assets can ever be confiscated by the government.  While the government presumably has control over the 26,000 or more bitcoin held in escrow for Silk Road customers, the larger asset base is the primary bitcoin addresses containing over two years worth of operating commissions. FBI estimates place this amount at nearly 600,000 bitcoin (currently worth $80m), however it is probably significantly less than 600,000 since earlier bitcoin was not worth what it is now and some of it would have been paid out to employees or reinvested back into ongoing operations.  Regardless, if access to those bitcoins is maintained via a brain wallet, then the only way for the government to gain access would be by compelling the defendant, Ross Ulbricht, to reveal his passphrase and private keys. A high-profile case such as this one making its way to the US Supreme Court would be as significant for bitcoin user rights as Roe v Wade is for women's abortion rights.  In the US, the government has typically run into the Fifth Amendment when attempting to gain access to passphrases and demand private key disclosure. Last year, Marcia Hoffman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation gave an excellent presentation on the evolving nature of these legal cases and how the privilege against self-incrimination is seen by the government as having boundaries and limitations.  Bitcoin may not have tremendous anonymity by default, but it does have tremendous deniability and that would be the preferred legal route for Ulbricht, according to Susan Brenner, professor of law and technology at the University of Dayton.  For deniability and beyond the ""forgone conclusion"" test, Brenner suggests in TIME that Ulbricht must demonstrate surrendering the password makes it evident that the bitcoin are his:  ""If I represented Ulbricht, I would argue that while the generic existence of the bitcoins is a foregone conclusion, his 'possession' of them is not . . . and that by providing the password would conclusively establish that they belong to him, which would mean that he would, under the act of production as testimony standard, be 'testifying' and, since the testimony would incriminate him, he could take the 5th Amendment.""  Executive editor of Laissez-Faire Books and organizer of the Crypto-Currency Conference, Jeffrey Tucker, asks:    ""But what's the message here? That bitcoin is a hugely valuable property, that it is hard for the government to rob, that it is the real thing and an authentic store of wealth, that it is a viable replacement for the dollar. These are the messages that are being sent by the government's actions.      The supreme irony: the Silk Road shutdown and looting might go down in history as the greatest boost to private currency ever. We could look back and see this as the event that finally unraveled the government's money monopoly and the world's problem with dollar imperialism.""    And there you have it. The most interesting aspect of the Silk Road case may not be the demonstrated capability of a regulation-free commercial zone. Nor may it be the breakthrough in merchant anonymity with a ratings system powering a digital agorism.  The most interesting aspect of the Silk Road case will most likely be the sweeping legal precedent set for compulsory key disclosure and the Fifth Amendment. If your online wealth cannot be robbed by common bandits or government officials, then the world truly has a digital money worth paying attention to.  Compelling an individual to turn over passwords or private decryption keys affects more than just access to financial property and information. It extends into any digital property or private information that is under the custody of an individual where its revelation constitutes self-incrimination.  But, it is the bitcoin area that has the greatest relevance for financial matters because access to the distributed bitcoin block chain is how ownership and transfers of that ownership are determined. Comprehending bitcoin 'ownership' requires an understanding of both peer-to-peer distributed computing and public key encryption for bitcoin addressing.  [post-quote]  When it comes to financial matters, protected wealth beyond confiscation has profound implications that alter society from its current trajectory of absolute financial surveillance. Key disclosure laws have much to say about how this scenario plays out and it will vary among jurisdictions. Due to growing and pervasive cryptography in our lives, it will come to be the single defining issue for liberty in the digital age. We must have universal and unconditional privileges against compulsory self-incrimination.  The effect of upholding the Fifth Amendment against compulsory key disclosure benefits not just drug crime defendants, but everyone that uses non-retrievable passwords.  For instance, pretrial legal funds could be segregated and deployed when necessary so that targeted defendants are no longer drained of the means for immediate and complete representation, as was the case with Kim Dotcom.  The alarming and repeated abuses of civil asset forfeiture would thankfully become a thing of the past.  Tax haven assets and other offshore banking activity, such as Cyprus, would no longer be subject to the trust of a bank or third-party custodian that shifts trusted privacy policies based on the latest politics or Nation-State bullying.  Levels of overall financial privacy, including retirement and inheritance instructions, would be determined by the individual without inversely asking for permission to retain your financial privacy.  The government is only discovering the power of the bitcoin block chain for the first time now, but its liberating properties are seductive on multiple levels. Even if the government and police are able to seize access to the bitcoin property involved in a criminal or civil asset forfeiture, they can no longer secretly divvy up the booty as graft and that is good for all of us.

42397282,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaoCKX,1382086821,Now accepting bitcoin: Seattle-based mobile grilled cheese truck,"Food trucks have proliferated in the digital age. With social media and geolocation, potential customers can keep tabs on their favorite foods prepared in mobile kitchens. These trucks also allow entrepreneurs to try new food concepts and themes.  The Cheese Wizards are a great example of this, melding fantasy and science fiction with mobile grilled cheese sandwiches. So, given their geek-like bent it would make sense that the Saxbe brothers Bo and Tom would accept bitcoin as a method of payment.  “The actual transaction is fairly simple: customers waltz up to our truck, drawn in by our irresistible cheese magic, and let us know they would like to pay in bitcoin,” says Bo Saxbe.  And the bitcoin business has been good. Actually, it has been much better than the brothers had expected.  “We've had one or two bitcoin sales every hour since we started using BitPay. Of course, that's only been a few days, but we were expecting just a few every week.”  Selling Harry Potter themed sandwiches such as the Voldemorta-Della or the gamer-centric Tomato Basil Soup Power Up can draw a pretty tech-savvy crowd. And for Cheese Wizards, it’s become pretty obvious that their customers like to spend money via bitcoins.  The Saxbe brothers didn’t do a whole lot of marketing in preparation to start accepting BTC.  “At the moment, we just have a homemade 'We accept bitcoin' sign in the window, but we plan on something with a little more panache soon! It’s pretty fun seeing the surprised expressions of customers who find out through the sign,” says Bo Saxbe.  In fact, the brothers thought implementing bitcoin as a method of payment would be a more difficult undertaking.  “It took us a little longer than it should have because we were expecting the process to be a bit of a hassle, but once we started, it was simple.”  Travis Skweres, CEO of the crytpocurrency exchange CoinMKT, says that the reduced risk of fraud makes accepting bitcoin an enticing proposition for small companies like Cheese Wizards.  [post-quote]  ""We get lots of businesses interested in bitcoin not only for the investment potential, but the reduced risk of fraud. Bitcoin can't be charged back like credit card transactions, so the chances of you making a sale and then not getting your money is virtually zero,"" says Skweres.  And privacy is something that in a larger sense might be why consumers should consider using bitcoin, according to the Saxbe brothers.  “Just as information has left the world of paper and cassette tape, money is increasingly an abstract entity,” Bo Saxbe said.  “In this world where money has been reduced to electronic reshuffling between a million private accounts, do we want any entities that can follow every exchange? I think most people don't like to envision a world where large financial companies or governments can track every purchase we make.”  Check out the Cheese Wizard locator or the truck’s Twitter account to see where the brothers will be if you’re in the Seattle area and want some grilled cheese. And don’t forget to bring along your bitcoin wallet.  What do you think about paying for food with bitcoin? Do you think that there are any specific advantages to paying for everyday expenses with BTC? Let us know in the comments.
