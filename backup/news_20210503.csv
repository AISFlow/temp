42406333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetWI6,1620074860,"Market Wrap: Ether Shoots to $3.3K While Bitcoin Hangs Below $60,000","Ether is excelling while the bitcoin sideshow is barely making gains. BNB breaks out on DeFi, going past $100 billion in market capitalization Monday.    Ether (ETH) trading around $3,290 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Gaining 10.7% over the previous 24 hours.  Ether’s 24-hour range: $2,941-$3,300 (CoinDesk 20)  Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $57,366 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Clmbing 0.76% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $56,427-$58,929 (CoinDesk 20)  Ether well above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Ether was trading around $3,290 as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET), gaining more than 10% over the prior 24 hours. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is the crypto story for Monday because the asset hit a fresh record high of $3,300 around 18:15 UTC (2:15 p.m. ET), according to CoinGecko.      “Ether has accelerated to new highs, reaching the targeted level of ~$3,000 from its April breakout far sooner than indicated,” noted technical analyst Katie Stockton, in Fairlead Strategies' Monday market update. “It is not wise to fight momentum, so we are reassuming a bullish near-term bias, somewhat reluctantly.”      Momentum, in the form of ether spot exchange volume, is clearly high. Ether volume tallied $35 billion Sunday, with bitcoin just a bit higher at $39 billion. Together, the two assets changed over $74 billion in value Sunday – and that’s on a weekend day. Traders will be eyeing volume for the rest of the business week to see where the price settles, particularly with ether continually hitting fresh levels on the spot market.      Meanwhile, over $20 billion in locked value inside decentralized finance, or DeFi, has been gained in the last month, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse. The value of ether, combined with traders looking for yield that exists for parking crypto in DeFi, is a fundamentally bullish sign for the Ethereum network overall.      “ETH has been powering for the past two years on the booming DeFi industry with a total value locked above $70 billion,” noted Elie Le Rest, partner at quantitative trading fund ExoAlpha. Le Rest also mentioned to CoinDesk the ambitious ecosystem upgrade Ethereum 2.0 as part of the catalyst for traders to punch buy on ETH. “Despite the high fees experienced by the Ethereum network, the market is starting to reflect the anticipated growth of ETH 2.0 into the price of ETH.”      The ether futures market is hitting brand-new levels not seen before, pushing open interest up to $8.8 billion and topping the previous record of $8.4 billion reached April 15, according to analytics provider Skew.      “I bet the launch of ETH futures has increased the comfort level of the massive asset managers that have sent U.S. stock market capitalization north of 200% of GDP and global bond yields negative,” said George Clayton, managing partner at investment firm Cryptanalysis Capital. ”I think ETH is acting like an institutional platform.”      Read More: Ether, on Winning Streak, Surges, Tops Bank of America on Market Cap    Bitcoin ekes out a gain    The price of bitcoin climbed Monday, going as high as $58,812 around 13:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET). That’s still over $6,000 off the record high for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, $64,829, set April 14.      “Bitcoin has recovered a portion of its mid-April pullback, which marked a drop of 27% from all-time highs on a loss of intermediate-term momentum,” noted Fairlead’s Stockton.      She doesn’t expect the price per 1 BTC to get back to previous lofty heights anytime soon – April was a record month for bitcoin’s price – May might not be so kind, however. “Short-term overbought conditions have returned below resistance of $62,000-$65,000, which presents a near-term hurdle,” added Stockton. “We will assume a bearish short-term bias.”      Read More: Bitcoin Holds Support, Faces Resistance at $60K    BNB, MKR and other markets    According to data aggregator CoinGecko, the Binance coin token (BNB) has surpassed $100 billion in market capitalization, reaching as high as $104 billion as of press time. It’s currently priced at over $673 per coin.      Sean Rooney, head of research for investment firm Valkyrie, says BNB, which is used on the Binance crypto exchange to offset fees charged on the platform, is riding high on the DeFi boom that started back in the summer of 2020.      “BNB is able to benefit from an explosive DeFi sector,” Rooney told CoinDesk.      Maker (MKR) is climbing Monday, up 17% as of press time. A transfer of over $450 million worth of the MakerDAO project's token to its community may be one of the reasons for its jump. MakerDAO is a decentralized stablecoin project built on Ethereum.      Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are mostly in the green on Monday. Notable winners as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET):    yearn finance (YFI) + 9.8%  litecoin (LTC) + 7.6%  tezos (XTZ) + 7.3%    Notable losers:    uniswap (UNI) - 2.4%  xrp (XRP) - 1.6%  the graph (GRT) - 1%    Equities:    The Nikkei 225 index in Japan was not open due to a holiday Monday.

42406330,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetWG8,1620070456,Now's the Time to Bet on Volatility in Bitcoin and Ether Markets: Options Experts,"Cryptocurrency traders are always using the options market to bet that prices on digital assets such as bitcoin and ether and will soar – or crater.      A lesser-known use for options trading is simply to bet on whether price swings, or volatility, will increase or decrease. And according to cryptocurrency market experts, the market is ripe for that kind of wager now.      ""Bitcoin's short-dated option implied volatility is trading below realized volatility,"" crypto derivatives data provider Genesis Volatility wrote in its weekly newsletter published on Sunday. ""Ether's implied volatility is trading at a huge discount to the realized volatility.""      When implied volatility is trading below historical volatility, it's a sign that the market is underpricing prospects for future price turbulence relative to recent price turbulence. Therefore, the implied volatility could rise and converge with and cross above the historical volatility, boosting options prices and yielding profits for buyers.      ""Buying options (call/put) in this environment is extremely interesting,"" Genesis Volatility said.      Traders buy options when volatility is relatively cheap and sell when it's high. Volatility trading, therefore, is pretty simple at the core: It is based on the age-old investment adage of buy low and sell high. It is analogous to buying an asset in the spot market when it is perceived as undervalued and selling when it appears to be overvalued.      Implied volatility refers to the market's expectation for price turbulence over a specific period, while historical or realized volatility represents volatility that has already played out.      Volatility has a positive impact on options prices. Options are hedging instruments that give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. A call option gives the right to purchase, and the put offers the right to sell.      According to data provided by Genesis Volatility, ether's 10-day implied volatility is trading at 87% – well below the 10-day realized volatility of 97%.      Bitcoin's 10-day implied volatility has been trading well below the 10-day historical volatility for close to two weeks; the gap, however, has narrowed somewhat in the past few days. At press time, the 10-day implied volatility stood at 69%, and the realized or historical volatility stood at 72%.      Some traders take advantage of such situations by purchasing non-directional or market-neutral strategies such as straddles and strangles, which involve buying an equal number of calls and puts and benefiting from a spike in volatility.      A long straddle is set up by purchasing a call and put option with the same expiration and strike price (usually nearest to the price of the underlying asset in the spot market).      For example, with ether currently trading near $3,170, a trader anticipating a significant spike in implied volatility may set up a strangle by purchasing the May 28 expiry call and put options at the $3,200 strike price.      A long strangle involves buying a call and put with the same expiry at strikes equidistant from the spot price. Buying an ether call at $3,300 and put at $3,100 would establish a long strangle.      “Traders use strategies like long straddles and strangles, which involve buying both calls and puts when volatility is expected to increase,” said Luuk Strijers, founder and chief commercial officer of Deribit, the dominant crypto options exchange. “That’s more likely at the moment with the implied volatility below realized volatility.”      Risk is predefined with these strategies, with the maximum loss limited to the extent of premium (options prices) paid while purchasing calls and puts. Straddles and strangles fail when the expected bump in implied volatility remains elusive till expiry. In such cases, options steadily lose value as expiration nears and become zero on the day of settlement.      That said, returns can be sizable, as theoretically the underlying asset can rise to infinity, boosting implied volatility to the moon and generating a colossal profit on the long call position of the strategy. Similarly, an asset can fall to zero, yielding significant returns on the long put position of the strategy.      As with other options strategies, traders consider multiple factors such as time left to expiration and macro news flow/events, along with implied volatility and historical volatility before taking long straddle/strangles.

42406329,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetWF9,1620064800,IoT Privacy Company IoTeX Is Envisioning the Future of NFTs,"Dr. Xinxin Fan, head of cryptography at IoTeX, a company working to secure the Internet of Things (IoT), has been appointed Vice Chair of the Standard for the Framework of Blockchain Use in Internet of Things. A subset of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) that helps create standards for the internet, the working group is focused on creating a universal standard for the use of blockchain in the Internet of Things (IoT).      Appointments such as these generally fly under the radar. Standards bodies, which help create the guiding agreements by which the internet is interoperable, are not often considered breaking news. But the appointment of Fan is interesting not only because of the way IoTeX has quietly been working in the background with companies, but also because of how the company is developing future use cases for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).      “The future of NFTs will involve using facts about the real world to mint digital assets,” said Raullen Chai, CEO of IoTeX. “IoTeX is pioneering this new design space to allow builders to use trusted data from trusted devices to facilitate if-then logic via smart contracts across the real world and blockchain world: if something happens in the real world then a smart contract can trigger something to happen in the digital world.”    Real-world NFTs    The NFT craze has largely focused on the art and experiential aspect. Various NFTs of digital art have sold for millions of dollars at auction and have expanded to include things like beer pong with Post Malone and a Kings of Leon album.      At the beginning of the month, NFTs experienced a slowdown in sales. While some pointed to it as a crash, a better way to refer to it would be as a natural pullback in an inflated market.      Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at Arca, a cryptocurrency investment firm, wrote in a newsletter he sees further growth coming to the NFT space.    Read more: Look to Design, Not Laws, to Protect Privacy in the Surveillance Age    “NFTs will expand beyond current use cases such as collectibles, art and gaming into more traditional use cases,” he wrote at the time. “Companies and projects that facilitate the growth and trading of NFTs could be big winners.”      That’s where IoTeX and the work it is doing comes in. It seems to be one of the more novel uses of NFTs, one that could lead to the market's sustainability with more widespread adoption, even if the NFTs are quietly functioning behind the scene on IoT devices rather than being sold for millions.      The idea is that an NFT, which is just a mechanism that proves something cryptographically in a non-fungible way, proves to a smart contact that you're at a specific place at a specific time. A smart contract can then trigger something to happen in the digital world. Think, for example, of minting an NFT that uses the real-world data as proof.    Proof of presence    IoTeX is starting with ""proof of presence"" based on verifiable real-world data from Pebble Tracker. Pebble Tracker lets developers working with blockchain and IoT use verifiable real world data which is owned exclusively by the device holder.      A release announcing Pebble Tracker in February described it as able to capture and cryptographically sign real-world data such as location, climate, motion and light using a built-in secure element (similar to the ones used in smartphones for FaceID and in cryptocurrency hardware wallets for private keys).      Larry Pang, head of business development at ‎IoTeX, said the company will quickly expand into other types of data and devices.      “We call this concept ‘proof of anything,’ which can include health data from wearables or automotive data from vehicles to trigger insurance-related smart contracts and much more,” he said. “With more ‘if’ statements based on real-world data, we can enable more ‘then’ statements via smart contracts.”      In practice, that might have ramifications for insurance, for example. Having verifiable data from your vehicle or verifiable data from your health wearable could trigger financial outcomes. Alternatively, if there is verifiable data regarding a storm, a smart contract might be triggered if that storm results in damage to a house.    Data lockers    Once gathered, verifiable data from the Pebble Tracker is then assigned to a decentralized identity (DID), which IoTeX describes as a ""personal data locker."" It allows users of a device to own this verifiable data exclusively, as well as to have full control to authorize their data for use by other applications from their device.      In this case, data verifiability from Pebble Tracker enables users to not only own their data, but also have full control over how it is used. Users can choose to keep their data absolutely private (by keeping it in their personal data locker), authorize others to access the raw data, or opt in to share this data with IoTeX Dapps for various purposes.    Read more: A16z Leads $28M Funding Round for Data Privacy Platform Aleo    Those that want to use Pebble Tracker only as a privacy-preserving asset tracker device can do so, but they also have the choice at any time to utilize or monetize their data under their own timelines and preferences.      At its core it makes data sharing an “opt-in” model rather than an “opt-out” one.    Current trials    Right now, IoTeX is working with HealthBlocks, a private health-care service based in Amsterdam that allows users to own, analyze and manage their health data.      The company envisions a future where different health-care wearables have secure hardware that can generate verifiable data to feed into open-source, machine-learning algorithms that could aid in predictive health outcomes or similar areas, based on data from other people also choose to share it.      “That's really the goal of what HealthBlocks are doing, starting with that co-ownership of data and really closing the loop where you can contribute your data to one of these on-chain collectives,” said Pang. “You're going to get the HealthBlocks token, which you can then use to access those AI models or even telehealth kind of calls.”      Overall, these sorts of use cases, and proof of presence, will play an interesting role in any standards talks on the IEEE.      “By co-creating standards with industry experts, IoTeX is committed not only to innovation in the blockchain space via our real-world products, such as Ucam and Pebble Tracker, but also the research/standards space via our leadership positions in the IEEE and IIC to help shape the future of blockchain and IoT” said Fan in a statement.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/03/iot-privacy-company-iotex-is-envisioning-the-future-of-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/efd82e7aa91f5249532d384aea18704f42118e6d-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406327,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetWDB,1620057510,Bitcoin Has a Nonviolent Security Model,"Say what you will about the social cost of securing the Bitcoin network, but it will never shoot anyone.      The same promise cannot be made under the security model of today's fiat currencies.    This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    Bitcoin secures its scarcity, and therefore its value, using only cryptography and its proof-of-work system.      Once upon a time, fiat currencies were secured by the value of gold. That stopped being the case in 1971 under President Richard Nixon, who declined to continue redeeming dollars for gold.      So now the value of dollars (and other fiat currencies that float like the dollar does) is secured by the powers of the state: its economy, its credit and its revenue, all of which is ultimately secured by its military and police forces.      This argument, it should be noted, is inspired by one of the latest in Nic Carter's ongoing series of posts on the issue of cryptocurrency and climate, but this post is not about global warming; this is about the application and the abnegation of institutional violence.    When the wind blows    At one point, Carter argues that if we're to compare the climate impact of different forms of money, one should factor in the climate impact of militaries that secure them. He writes:      ""Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly ...      “The dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars.""      It would probably also make sense to throw police forces in here as well.      Freely floating currencies are backed by the full faith and credit of the nation-state that issues them, but they are also backed by the state monopoly on violence.    The cradle will rock    Hopefully, no one is going to quibble over whether states have the monopoly on violence. Peaceful dispute resolution is, like, the main point of government.      If you and your neighbor have a dispute about who can plant a garden on which piece of dirt, it is no longer permissible to ""settle this like men."" Fisticuffs have been disallowed as a means of sorting out differences. It's a matter for the local magistrates and the courts, which in turn are backed by police forces enforcing their decisions.      Today, those same forces also guarantee the monopoly on the issuance of currencies.      For most of us, this is hardly even worth discussing. Why would anyone ever want to use anything but the state currency? It's so convenient! It has such great network effects! What kind of action would ever need to be taken to protect the monopoly of the thing that's so obviously the best thing to use?      Except, crypto bans have been floated by nation-states several times around the world already.    When the bough breaks    If a full-on ban were ever to be enacted, it won't be the accountants and the lawyers in the securities regulatory offices that go looking for folks hiding bitcoin. It will be state employees authorized to wear sidearms as fashion accessories who do it.      An obvious objection to this post will be: Look, most states follow the lead of the U.S. and the U.S. has been pretty clear that it's fine with cryptocurrency in general – it just needs to hammer out some rules for it.      This objection misses the point. The point is not whether states will or won't ban crypto. The point is that the U.S. could. It could use its police forces to maintain its monopoly rights over the money supply. The U.S. could try it; any nation-state with a police force could try it.      So in that way it's not only the faith and credit securing the money supply, it's also the apparatus of violence. At the end of the day, all authority of any state comes down to a mixture of the will of the governed and the state's monopoly on violence. Some governments err more on one side and some err more on the other.    The cradle will fall    But Bitcoin (and, for that matter, its progeny) will never show up at anyone's door to enforce its value in the market. Bitcoin is and always will be secured by cryptography, electricity and the network effect of its users. That's it.      I can take this one step further: Let's get a bit science fiction-y and imagine that some ultra-powerful new codebreaking technology comes along and it beats the cryptography underlying bitcoin – all the private keys become public! All the secrets are exposed!      What happens?      Bitcoin just breaks. It's donezo. There's no fallback. F2 and Antpool don't have armies secreted away somewhere to come out and enforce whose wallets belong to whom.      Many bitcoiners may be partial to firearms, but bitcoin itself has no use for them.

The position, amounting to $11.5 million, was led by Arrington Capital and Blocktower Capital and included Spartan Group and Skynet Trading.      This purchase continues a string of ongoing interest in privacy-protecting tech at a time when other networks focused on everything from data to transactional privacy have drawn interest from funders.      According to the announcement, the acquired position will support the growth of applications on Secret Network, particularly in regards to the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystems.      “Secret is the first blockchain ecosystem to prioritize privacy. Financial privacy is critical to individual freedom, and Arrington Capital has long been committed to financial privacy and censorship resistance,” said Michael Arrington, founder of Arrington Capital, in a statement. “The rapid expansion of decentralized finance makes solutions like Secret Network a timely addition to the DeFi ecosystem.”    Read more: SecretSwap Is the Secret Network’s Answer to DeFi Privacy    One such application is SecretSwap, the Secret Network’s answer for privacy on DeFi. SecretSwap is a front-running resistant and cross-chain automated market maker (AMM) with privacy protection.      According to the announcement, over $100 million in Ethereum assets are currently being used within the Secret DeFi ecosystem, and multiple bridges to additional ecosystems are in development. Daily gas use has grown nearly 3,000% since January, and the number of active Secret accounts (not including exchange addresses) has grown 500%.      ""Of all the networks in all the world, we chose Secret because it was a yes-yes-yes brainer,” said Monty Munford, Chief Evangelist and core contributor to privacy DeFi company Sienna Network, which is building their platform on Secret Network. “They understand privacy and we understand DeFi. Match made in heaven.”    Secret NFTs    It will also support a more novel privacy endeavor currently in development: “Secret NFTs.”      Secret NFTs are non-fungible tokens that allow for private ownership as well as public and private metadata. Multiple Secret apps leveraging Secret NFTs are being developed for launch on the network in Q2 2021.      Tor Bair, the Secret Foundation’s executive director and chairman, said Secret NFTs are distinguished by two primary features. One is private ownership. NFTs are rare, so anyone can figure out who owns a certain NFT and then correlate addresses with individuals. Allowing for private ownership of NFTs ensures assets and transactions do not need to be exposed to everyone by default.    Read more: Community Behind Privacy-Focused Smart Contract Forges Ahead After Settlement    The second feature is private metadata.      “In addition to public metadata, Secret NFTs provide an optional private metadata field,” said Bair. “This enables you to do things like have game cards that have some public abilities, as well as special hidden abilities. Or an art NFT creator might choose to make a thumbnail or watermarked version of the image public so people have an idea of what they are buying, but the full resolution/non-watermarked version is private and must be purchased to view it.”      Finally, Secret Network will continue to dish out developer grants for applications developed on the network. The first Secret Network grant was awarded for the development of Secret NFTs. The second Secret Network grant was just announced for Fardels, a decentralized and private social media platform allowing creators to share items of small value.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/05/03/secret-network-raises-115m-to-further-privacy-and-app-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1276aff7bd54e8af27674def866cca28377204c7-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42406319,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetW3L,1620050386,Soccer Player Ifunanyachi Achara the Latest Sports Pro to Take Salary in Bitcoin,"A fifth-year forward for Toronto FC is the latest professional athlete to convert a portion of his salary to bitcoin.      Ifunanyachi Achara, 23, said he takes around half of his Major League Soccer (MLS) salary in bitcoin by linking with a third-party exchange service. He switched to Bitwage in February after months of self-executing Binance buys.      Achara is among the first pro athletes to go public with their bitcoin salaries. Like National Football League players Sean Culkin and Russell Okung, Achara said he believes bitcoin is a hedge against fiat inflation – particularly in his home country. The Nigerian naira’s annual inflation hit a four-year high at above 18% in March.      “The rate of inflation is killing us,” Achara said in an interview. “The more the U.S. prints money during COVID to help people, the more it devalues our currency. So my family, when I send them money home, I send them bitcoin.”      Bitcoin remittances have appealed for years to pockets of foreigners moving money back home. BTC’s decentralized nature allows users to sidestep high wire-transfer fees. In the case of Nigeria, whose government shuts down private citizens' bank accounts, according to Achara, it allowed him to skirt a monetary blockade.    Read more: Nigerian Banks Shut Them Out, so These Activists Are Using Bitcoin to Battle Police Brutality    “If I wanted to send money to my parents to move away from a state that I felt like was really violent, I couldn't,” Achara said. “I couldn't send them money to the bank. It was just through Bitcoin that I was able to send my family money more easily and efficiently and as fast as possible.”      Many Nigerians are storing their wealth in foreign bills, according to Bloomberg. Achara’s family is just doing it in bitcoin. They occasionally trade their bitcoin for the local currency, he said. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s central bank is allegedly closing crypto traders’ bank accounts.      For Bitwage, Achara is the company's first pro athlete, though CEO Jonathan Chester said the company is ""in conversations with other athletes, musicians and famous influencers.""      ""We’ve been helping people get paid in bitcoin for seven years,"" Chester said via email, ""but this is the first year that we are really starting to see bitcoin payroll pick up with mainstream markets.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/05/03/soccer-player-ifunanyachi-achara-the-latest-sports-pro-to-take-salary-in-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/35c3f5bdbf7f763579f3a42aa74e835835fa4c31-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The initial public offering (IPO), which kicked off more than eight months ago on the Ethereum blockchain, follows a pending CAD$39.6 million ($32.2 million) private placement that INX raised ahead of its listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.      Along with earlier private token sales, INX expects to have raised more than $125 million for the launch and operation of its INX cryptocurrency and digital securities trading platform. The move places INX near the top of the list of publicly traded crypto exchanges, after Coinbase listed last month and as others such as Kraken are courting public markets.

The INX token is also the first exchange token to give investors on-chain revenue, said Tokensoft CEO Mason Borda. (Tokensoft was the transfer agent for the INX IPO.) Token holders receive 40% of distributions from the company with no voting rights, while equity holders will receive 60% of distributions with voting rights.      “We're excited to welcome the launch of the INX Exchange and to see how they're going to integrate the INX token into their platform,” Borda said. “Is it solely a way for users to get a percentage of those cash flows or what are the unique ways in which they're going to be able to connect with their users?”    Read more: TokenSoft to Trade Digital Securities on tZERO’s Retail Market    The INX sale is also one of the most distributed security token sales in the U.S., Borda said.

42406328,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetWCC,1620046800,DeFi Oracle Umbrella Network Migrates to Binance Smart Chain From Ethereum,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) oracle Umbrella Network, which acts as a bridge between smart contracts and off-chain data feeds, is shifting its base from Ethereum to relatively low-cost smart contract platform Binance Smart Chain (BSC).      ""Integrating with BSC offers Umbrella multiple advantages when compared to working on other platforms, including transaction fees that are over 90% lower than what is incurred on Ethereum,"" the company said in an announcement on Monday. ""For example, while the Ethereum transaction to get a data point onchain might cost $50, that same transaction might only cost 50 cents via BSC.""      So, with the BSC integration, Umbrella Network can run frequent data updates and provide the most current price for smart contracts using its feeds.      BSC has been on a tear of late, having surpassed Ethereum in daily unique active wallets and transaction count early this year. Ethereum has become a victim of its own success, with record activity leading to network congestion and high transaction costs and increased demand for rival blockchains, layer 2 sidechains.    Read more: DeFi Major Aave Working With Polygon to Bypass Ethereum Congestion    On Saturday, BSC processed 7.3 million transactions, nearly six times greater than Ethereum's tally of 1.42 million, according to data source BscScan.com.      Per DeBank, PancakeSwap, the top BSC-based decentralized exchange, now has a total value locked of nearly $10.4 billion, making it bigger than the top three Ethereum-based DeFi protocols – Uniswap, Compound and DeFi.      ""From our first product roadmap, we have planned to integrate into BSC, and the timing couldn't be better, given the platform's exploding ecosystem,"" Umbrella's founding partner Sam Kim said.      Some researchers have recently voiced concerns about possible centralization on BSC, as the smart contract platform relies on just 21 validators selected daily to approve transactions. Meanwhile, ether has more than 125,000 validators, data source BeaconScan shows.      Umbrella Network, however, said it is confident that the shift to the less decentralized BSC will facilitate faster decentralization of its own network.      ""Lower operating costs on BSC will allow Umbrella to move faster toward its goals of full decentralization by giving more members of the community the opportunity to participate as validators almost immediately,"" Kim noted in the press release. ""On Ethereum, that network's prohibitive costs required node operators to have large capital bases to operate effectively.""    Read more: PancakeSwap Widens Binance Smart Chain’s Lead Over Ethereum on Transactions    The oracle network plans to use the savings generated from the shift to BSC to deepen its data library. ""The low-cost structure enables Umbrella to add more data points to the industry-leading 1,000+ data pairs already available via the Umbrella Network,"" Kim said.      The migration kicks off Umbrella's ""BSC Month"" event, during which the oracle network will announce new partnerships with more than 10 BSC-based projects, beginning this week with the first three: Smoothy, BlockBank and UnoRe.      In addition, Umbrella Network recently signed partnerships with cryptocurrency exchange Huobi, and Asia-based infrastructure provider HashQuark.

42406322,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetW7H,1620039600,Former CFTC Boss' Digital Dollar Project Ready to Kick Off First US CBDC Tests,"The U.S.-based Digital Dollar Project is kicking off a handful of pilot projects to test how a Federal Reserve-issued central bank digital currency (CBDC) may operate.      The organization, which is led by former U.S. regulators and executives from the consulting firm Accenture, announced its intention to launch within the next year its first five pilot projects to evaluate different aspects of a digital dollar.      A digital dollar – a central bank-issued, tokenized form of the U.S. currency – could help improve financial access for the unbanked and make it easier to disburse government aid, proponents argue. Opponents say existing technologies may be better suited for those tasks. A number of countries are already experimenting with the concept, with China’s digital yuan perhaps the most advanced so far.      The Digital Dollar Foundation was formed last year by Accenture, former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, former LabCFTC director Daniel Gorfine and investor Charles Giancarlo to design and advocate for the digital dollar. It's a private effort separate from the Federal Reserve's own research into a CBDC, though the two groups have been in contact, said David Treat, one of the directors of the project.      The five pilot projects will evaluate whether and how a digital dollar would benefit individuals who are unbanked or underbanked, individuals who do have access to banking services and small businesses.      “What we’re announcing is a funding structure, a process structure and a framework for how the Digital Dollar Project is going to form a testing ground for these (efforts),” Treat said.      Treat, who is a senior managing director at Accenture, said that the projects would receive support from Accenture, but would also be self-funded. He declined to share any specific details about the projects.      He did say, however, that they are designed to be “as close … as we can get” to a real-world application.      “Of course, until it’s something that is minted and issued by the Federal Reserve, it won’t be a central bank digital currency, but the advantage we have is it’s the same underlying structure,” Treat said. “We can use a stablecoin structure to directly demonstrate how a CBDC would perform, and the only difference is who the issuer is.”      Treat said he expects results to come in fairly quickly.      “Some of them we’ll be able to get results fairly quickly, measured in months, not quarters, and we’ll extend well into 2022,” Treat said. “As individual pilots are completed, we’re going to share those results.”      UPDATE (May 3, 2021, 12:15 UTC): Updated to clarify that the Digital Dollar Project is a private enterprise.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | RESEARCH,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/03/former-cftc-boss-digital-dollar-project-ready-to-kick-off-first-us-cbdc-tests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1c6b1a9a4eb269c1de6d7fe34088a59adf4ac18e-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42406309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSkh,1620037347,"Ether's Price Rally Above $3.2K Appears Spot-Driven, Boding Well for Further Gains","Ether latest rally is being fueled by spot-market gains rather than by a build-up of leverage in the derivatives market, analysts said, potentially signaling that the price gains may have legs.      The second-largest cryptocurrency rose to a record high of $3,201 early Monday, making its year-to-date gain over 330%, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      ""Ethereum's funding rates remain flat and went negative early today on FTX,"" Matthew Dibb, chief operating officer and co-founder of Stack Funds, said. ""Our view is that the spot-driven rally for ETH is primarily due to excitement around the impending EIP 1559 upgrade.""      The funding rate, calculated and paid every eight hours, refers to the cost of holding long positions in perpetuals (futures with no expiry). A high funding rate implies increased buying in the derivatives market, which doesn't appear to be the case with ether now.      The average funding rate across major exchanges is barely holding above zero at press time, meaning the derivatives segment is far from overheated and the buying pressure is mainly stemming from spot markets.      An overheated derivatives market typically leads to sudden price pullbacks similar to ones seen in January and mid-February after the funding rate reached highs above 0.15%.      According to Swiss-based derivatives data provider Laevitas, the breakout above $3,000 could be long-lasting. ""Despite ether flying past $3,000, funding rates are completely flat. So this certainly feels like a sustainable spot-led rally,"" Laevitas tweeted early Monday.      Ki Young Ju, CEO of blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant, said institutional buyers look to be accumulating the cryptocurrency. ""Roughly 400,000 ETH flowed out of Coinbase a few days ago. Speculative guess, institutions are now buying ether,"" Ju said on Twitter.      Coinbase outflows are taken to represent institutional buying, as the exchange's custody wallets are directly integrated with its over-the-counter (OTC) desk. Institutions typically deal with OTC desks.      Some investors look to be betting on a continued rally toward $5,000. Among all the options listed on the dominant crypto exchange Deribit, the most common open position is the $5,000 call, data shared by the options analytics platform Laevitas shows.      The total open interest in the $5,000 call is 69,000 contracts at press time. Of that, 15,970 are due to expire at the end of May and 18,400 at the end of June.      A call option gives the purchaser the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. In plain English, a call option is a bullish bet.  The bullish sentiment likely stems from analysts predicting a considerable drop in ether's annual issuance following the EIP 1559 upgrade – a proposal to change Ethereum's fee structure, also known as ""Ethereum's scarcity engine"" or ""ETH's burn mechanism"".      That said, the options market currently sees less than a 10% probability of ether ending the second quarter above $5,000, according to data source Skew. The cryptocurrency remains vulnerable to the effects of sharp bitcoin price pullbacks.

42406305,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAetSji,1620006238,"Ether, on Winning Streak, Surges to Record Over $3.2K, Tops Bank of America on Market Cap","Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, surged Monday to a new record price of over $3,200 amid fresh speculation the network's value might soar as more traders warm to the potential of decentralized finance, known as DeFi, and other uses like non-fungible tokens or NFTs.      The 10% gain was the biggest in two months, and the new all-time high price of $3,253 came just hours after the market topped $3,000 for the first time. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has risen for nine straight days, its longest winning streak since the bull market of late 2017 and early 2018. The ether price has quadrupled just this year alone, outperforming bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, which has doubled.      Ether now has a market capitalization of $364 billion, exceeding that of Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, as well as that of the entertainment giant Walt Disney and food conglomerate Nestle.      The latest price move comes amid signs of growing interest in ether from big institutional investors and Wall Street firms – similar to the dynamic that propelled bitcoin to a market capitalization over $1 trillion earlier this year.      Late last week, the Wall Street investment-research firm FundStrat predicted ether could surge to $10,000 this year, powered by enthusiasm over DeFi's growth and advances in Internet-based financial applications.      ""It used to be the other way around, but now Bitcoin is riding the coattails of Ethereum,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the brokerage Oanda, wrote Monday in an email.      The daily transaction count has increased by 22% to 1.376 million this year, per data provided by Glassnode. The Ethereum network settled $1.5 million in transactions in the first quarter alone, more than the combined tally of the previous seven quarters.      “These applications are generating ~3x fees for the Ethereum network vs. Bitcoin, which trades at ~3x the market cap,” FundStrat's David Grider wrote.      Even analysts for JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, have acknowledged the network's promise – despite some predictions that the success of DeFi's automated, blockchain-based trading and lending applications might eventually steal market share from traditional financial firms.      “In combination with the continued growth for DeFi and other components of the Ethereum-based economy, this suggests some technical but occasionally important bullish tailwinds versus bitcoin,"" according to JPMorgan.      The network CoinMetrics data shows the number of active addresses recently climbed to a new all-time high of 771,000, surpassing the previous record of 739,000 set in November.      And according to DeFi Pulse, which tracks use of DeFi applications, the amount of collateral locked in decentralized trading, lending and insurance applications has climbed to $72 billion, a fourfold increase so far in 2021. The figure was less than $1 billion at the start of 2020.      The total market capitalization for DeFi recently topped $100 billion, with some of the most popular projects, like Uniswap and Compound, built on the Ethereum blockchain.      “Ether is one of the main beneficiaries in the wider explosion in the cryptocurrency market,"" Nigel Green, chief executive officer of deVere Group, wrote in emailed comments. ""The boom over recent months has been fueled by soaring interest from major institutional investors and growing recognition that borderless digital currencies are the future of money.""      Some traders are buying options to bet on further gains – including the prospect of a rally in the ether price to $5,000 by the end of May.      One catalyst might be the so-called Ethereum Improvement Proposal 1559, or EIP 1559, which is designed to make transactions on the blockchain more efficient. But it could also counteract any inflation that comes from new supplies of the cryptocurrency being mined into existence.      The change, approved in March, is supposed to take effect in July as part of a network upgrade known as the London hard fork.      ""Investors are just starting to digest the potential impact on the economics of Ethereum,"" Martin Gaspar, a research analyst at CrossTower, said Monday on CoinDesk TV's First Mover show.      Additional excitement comes from Ethereum's planned ""Eth 2.0"" upgrade, which will transform the network from using the energy-hungry proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, similar to bitcoin's, to a more capital-intensive proof-of-stake (PoS) system. A consensus mechanism is the system a blockchain uses to confirm transactions and assure network security.      Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin gave a presentation recently on the network's development roadmap after its merge to proof-of-stake, including a long-awaited feature known as sharding that could boost transaction throughput and speed. Sharding will expand Ethereum’s capacity to process transactions by splitting its database into 64 new mini-blockchains, addressing network congestion.      High fees on the Ethereum blockchain has been a nagging source of complaints among users, spurring the growing use of rival blockchains such as Binance Smart Chain, which is affiliated with Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume.      Cryptocurrency traders have bid up prices for Binance's BNB token as well as digital assets associated with so-called Ethereum killers, include Solana and Polkadot.      Ether ""is already years ahead of bitcoin in everything but price and fame,"" according to deVere's Green. ""There’s a real sense that 2021 is the year for ether. Its time has come.”    The native token of Ethereum's blockchain clocked a record high of $3,252 around 16:45 coordinated universal time, having crossed above the $3,000 mark during Asian hours.  At press time, ether was changing hands at $3,253, up 11% in the past 24 hours or 10% since 0:00 UTC.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Muyao Shen, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/03/ether-on-winning-streak-surges-to-record-over-32k-tops-bank-of-america-on-market-cap,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96f9c4ef0473fdf14a4fbc2e8a8d88ecc6190bb6-1200x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
