The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) – an industry-funded watchdog working under the authority of the Securities and Exchange Commission – said the reports that tally reserve holdings as proof a company is protected against financial runs don’t provide “meaningful assurance.” They’re not audits, the board said in a Wednesday statement, and they don’t comply with any particular standard.  In the absence of the full-scale audits typically seen in traditional finance, proof-of-reserve reports are commonly used by U.S. digital assets businesses, such as Kraken’s report that it held $19 billion in bitcoin and ether and Crypto.com’s data in December that client assets were fully backed one-to-one. They are also used by global platforms such as Binance.  These verifications of assets take a simple snapshot and “do not address the crypto entity’s liabilities, the rights and obligations of the digital asset holders, or whether the assets have been borrowed by the crypto entity to make it appear they have sufficient collateral,” according to the PCAOB. And such documents definitely don’t prove anything about a company’s internal controls or governance, the board added.  “Proof of reserve reports are inherently limited, and customers should exercise extreme caution when relying on them to conclude that there are sufficient assets to meet customer liabilities,” the PCAOB said in its statement.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/03/08/crypto-sectors-reserve-reports-cant-be-trusted-says-us-audit-watchdog,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/eda60b604ee85bb164daa42580b43afda1c04557-5727x3222.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Marathon said that on March 8 the term loan prepayment was completed and the company’s credit facilities with Silvergate Bank were terminated, reducing its debt by $50 million, according to a statement. The debt paid down also increased its unrestricted bitcoin holdings by 3,132 because the bitcoin that was being held as collateral by a third-party custodian was returned to the miner, the statement said.  ""We have reduced our leverage by approximately $50 million, immediately freed up approximately $75 million in bitcoin that was being held as collateral for the term loan, and reduced our annual cash interest costs and facility fees by approximately $5 million,"" said Hugh Gallagher, Marathon’s chief financial officer, in the statement.  The company has been taking steps to shore up its balance sheet by paying off some of its debts and freeing up its restricted bitcoin that were being used as collateral. In January, Marathon said that it fully paid off $30 million in revolver loans with Silvergate in December, freeing up 3,615 bitcoin (BTC) that had been pledged as collateral.

42411017,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ghvUTn,1678314673,Bitcoin Whales Have Been Swimming in Different Directions,"Bitcoin whales have been swimming in different directions.  Smaller whales, or those holding a balance of 1,000 or more bitcoin (BTC), have been in a steady, prolonged decline, falling 13% to 2,003 since a short-term peak of 2,292 in March 2022.  But the number of larger whales, or those holding over 10,000 BTC, have exhibited the exact opposite behavior, increasing 34% over the same period.  The diverging behavior reflects the groups’ differing sentiment about bitcoin’s prospects in the months ahead, and their investment strategies.  Given past behavior it appears that smaller whales may be taking a more tactical approach to holdings consistent with their approaches in recent years. These whales have in recent years shown a remarkable ability, whether through luck, skill or a combination of both, to reduce bitcoin holdings at favorable moments.  Larger whales who may hold upwards of $220 million in bitcoin, by contrast, have been less tactical, likely because their size constrains their ability to respond quickly to changing market conditions.  Whale behavior generally offers substantial clues about the crypto market’s direction. Whales tend to buy bitcoin when they believe prices are at low points and that conditions are ripe for an upturn. Their acquisitions tend to spur spikes in bitcoin’s price and overall valuation. As bitcoin’s price has tumbled more than 70% from its all-time high near $70,000 in late 2021, the number of whale addresses holding at least 10,000 BTC has risen 7%.  Market conditions have soured over the past two weeks and whales have been sending BTC to exchanges – a bearish signal. In this light, larger whales’ movements may be confusing.  Or perhaps market observers should keep a keener eye on smaller whales, given their track record of avoiding danger.  The behavior aligns with metrics showing that whales have been sending BTC from their unique wallets to centralized exchanges – a bearish sign.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/08/bitcoin-whales-have-been-swimming-in-different-directions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a873e95aad2bb718b3f578dfbc8f1f6fb1afe59b-6000x4000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394478,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bw8Kf5,1678314231,What Are the Top NFT Blockchains?,"Non-fungible tokens (NFT) took off during the crypto bull run of 2021. In less than a year, blockchain-based digital assets went from being an obscure technicality to a maturing asset class.  NFTs including celebrity-favorite Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Beeple’s $69 million digital artwork sale brought much public attention to Ethereum, the blockchain that hosts the most high-profile NFTs. Many people now associate NFTs with Ethereum. After all, the network has processed more than $37 billion in NFT trades. No other chain comes close.  But Ethereum isn’t the only NFT blockchain. Any blockchain with smart-contract capabilities can support NFTs. Indeed, some have thriving NFT ecosystems, if not as developed as that of Ethereum.  “Top NFT blockchains” is a tough list to make precisely because the ranking frequently changes as the crypto industry continuously evolves. But some chains such as Ethereum and Solana have established firm positions in the NFT blockchain leaderboard. For others, the competition is more fierce.  Ethereum  Ethereum’s the king of all NFT chains. Its popularity even surprised Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum’s co-founder.  The technical development that made NFTs possible on Ethereum took place in 2015 when developers introduced the ERC-721, a non-fungible token standard. But it wasn’t until 2021 the NFT market on Ethereum truly blossomed. During the height of the NFT bull run, historical NFTs, which predate 2020, became highly prized.  Some of the most popular NFT projects such as CryptoPunks are native to Ethereum, which inspired a myriad of profile picture-style (PFP) NFT projects. Until late in 2022 most of the trading took place on OpenSea, the multichain marketplace that originally began on Ethereum. OpenSea facilitated billions of dollars in NFTs during the bull market.  Since pro-focused NFT marketplace Blur launched in October 2022, a huge shift in trading volume for ETH-based NFTs has occurred, with Blur’s trading volume overtaking OpenSea in February 2023 for the first time.  The popularity of NFTs on Ethereum has a downside. When the NFT trade becomes too hot the network gets clogged, sending the network’s transaction fees, known as gas, to sky-high levels. When Yuga Labs launched its “Otherdeeds” NFTs on Ethereum in 2022, gas fees cost investors over $100 million, with single transactions racking up $3,000 fees.  Solana  Solana has climbed to be the second-biggest NFT chain with a fledgling NFT ecosystem of its own.  Magic Eden, the chain’s biggest NFT marketplace, has recorded over $1 billion in trading volume so far. At one point in May 2022, the Solana-native marketplace even topped OpenSea’s NFT Ethereum trading volume. As of April 2022, OpenSea also began supporting Solana NFTs.  To buy and sell Solana NFTs, you need a Solana-compatible wallet such as Trust Wallet, Exodus Wallet or Phantom. The wallet needs to be topped up with enough SOL to pay any gas fees, which are generally lower than on Ethereum, generally only a fraction of a penny.  In the early days of Solana’s NFT ecosystem, the network was filled with Ethereum NFT knockoffs. These included Degen Apes, inspired by BAYC; and SolPenguins, inspired by Pudgy Penguins. As the network’s NFT ecosystem grew, original projects including Okay Bears and DeGods became household names for Solana – so much so that Okay Bears got copied onto Ethereum.  DeGods and Y00ts were so successful that another up-and-coming NFT blockchain, Polygon, paid them to migrate to their ecosystem in January 2023.  Polygon  Polygon is what's known as a sidechain or scaling tool for Ethereum, and essentially was created to help reduce costs and the increase speed of transactions.  A relative newcomer to the NFT marketshare battle, Polygon has made impressive progress not only by bringing over high-profile projects like Y00ts and DeGods, but also by working with notable personalities for NFT launches, such as Former President Donald Trump’s first foray into NFTs.  Most notably, Polygon has driven adoption by working with many mainstream brands to launch their own NFT projects. To date, Polygon powers Starbucks’ Odyssey program, Reddit’s wildly popular digital avatars, Nike’s .swoosh platform, Meta Platforms’ integration of NFTs on Instagram and DraftKing’s NFT marketplace.  NFT marketplaces OpenSea, Magic Eden and most recently, Rarible support NFTs minted on Polygon. To date, Polygon has done over $700 million in trading volume, according to CryptoSlam.  Flow  Flow grew out of frustration with the NFT experience on Ethereum.  Cat-breeding NFT game CryptoKitties clogged Ethereum in 2017, prompting Dapper Labs, the company behind the project, to launch an alternative blockchain for games and consumer applications.  Today, Flow is best known for NBA Top Shot, the NFT collectibles of National Basketball Association highlights. It was one of most popular NFT projects until the profile-picture NFT trend took over as of mid-2021, which has led to Flow falling behind some of the other chains in terms of volume. As of writing, Flow has done over $1 billion in trading volume, but the activity has taken a dramatic downturn since its all-time high of over $244 million in February 2021. Two years later, Flow had just over $6 million in trading volume.  NBA Top Shot is just one among many big-IP projects on Flow. The chain is especially popular with top sports brands. Branded projects building on Flow include NFL ALL DAY, Ticketmaster, UFC Strike, Mattel, LaLiga Golazos, Seussibles (Dr. Seuss), Gaia, Genies and Aera by OneFootball.  Dapper Labs has a significant presence on the network and Dapper Wallet is the most popular wallet for Flow. Dapper’s centralized control of Flow and NBA Top Shots has recently led to some legal battles for the company, which is facing a class-action lawsuit involving its Top Shot NFTs.",NEUTRAL,ETH | SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC | SOL | TRADING,"Ekin Genç, Toby Leah Bochan",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-the-top-nft-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/210a0e9652afbf3b496c836e0a4ed64d67692768-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Co-founder Gutemberg Dos Santos pleaded guilty in October 2021 after being extradited to the U.S. from his native country of Panama in November 2020.

Victims could view their “balances” on an online portal but the numbers were fake and they could not withdraw funds.  According to prosecutors, victims’ funds were instead spent on enriching the club’s founders and promoters, who spent the money on “cars, jewelry and luxury homes” as well as “more extravagant expos to recruit more victims.”  All six pleaded guilty to charges of wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and bank fraud conspiracy.

42415615,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JteQ,1678310930,Pension Fund-Backed Parataxis Capital Shakes Off Crypto Winter With New Fund,"Parataxis Capital, a multi-strategy crypto investment firm that has rare backing from a U.S. pension fund system, is launching a new fund with a long/short relative value trading strategy and $25 million to $50 million in initial committed capital, CEO Edward Chin told CoinDesk in an interview.  Parataxis made headlines in August when Fairfax County, Virginia’s $6.8 billion pension fund, the Fairfax County Retirement Systems, said it would invest $35 million in the firm’s yield farming fund. Parataxis had about $116 million in assets under management when it spoke to CoinDesk in late October – just weeks before the collapse of crypto giant FTX – and was targeting $500 million in assets for this year. Despite the increased turbulence, that yield fund is up 7% since its inception last Mayand 1% so far this year, and Parataxis maintains $75 million in total assets, said Chin.  The new Parataxis Relative Value Momentum Fund (RVM) will use machine learning and momentum-based quantitative signals to generate returns. The dollar-neutral strategy is expected to carry less risk than a purely directional approach, an important distinction in the cautious investment environment. The RVM fund was launched in response to growing institutional interest, and will initially be available only to general partners and a small group of investors. The fund will open to more investors in the near future.  Parataxis was able to avoid exposure to FTX's collapse due to its policy of not trading on offshore exchanges, said Chin, and didn’t face a rush of redemptions from investors. Though crypto is obviously in a bear market, the atmosphere is different from the previous one, Chin said, when the talk had turned to whether crypto would continue to exist as an asset class.  “The conversations we’re having with institutional allocators now are no longer ‘Is this going to disappear,’ but rather ‘We’re trying to figure out the right type of exposure to have to the asset class’ – especially due to the volatility in the market that’s likely to persist,” said Chin.  Despite the challenging environment, Chin said Parataxis plans to launch a fifth fund in the second half of the year. The quantitative smart-beta strategy would come via either a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-registered interval fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). The goal would be to outperform a bitcoin portfolio.

42415619,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5Ju6y,1678307875,"Grayscale Chief Legal Officer: A Spot Bitcoin ETF Will Protect U.S. Investors, Consumers","There are many possible outcomes if a federal court rules in Grayscale's favor in its lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), said Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer.  The lawsuit was filed by the CoinDesk sister company after the SEC rejected Grayscale's application to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund. Grayscale argued the futures-based bitcoin ETFs the SEC has already approved are fundamentally no different from the bitcoin-holding (spot) ETF Grayscale wants to offer.  ""Futures derive their pricing from the underlying spot markets, given that they are derivatives of spot bitcoin,"" Salm said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” on Wednesday. ""If we're going to have bitcoin futures trading being approved by the SEC, how can we not also have spot bitcoin ETFs be approved as well?""  He added, ""Is the commission acting arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act? And are they discriminating against issuers in violation of the Exchange Act by approving bitcoin futures and denying spot bitcoin?""  On Tuesday a panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., seemed to agree with Grayscale's argument. The court is expected to issue its ruling in the next three to 12 months.  Should the court rule in Grayscale's favor there are several possible things that could happen next, according to Salm. “The commission could approve GBTC as a spot bitcoin ETF"" as well as approve those spot ETFs from other companies that have been similarly rejected by the SEC.  ""We think that’s really the right position,” he said.  ""I think now we're seeing ... crypto is here to stay. Bitcoin is here to stay and we're not going to be able to ban it,"" he said. ""Conversely, what can we do to further regulate and protect U.S. investors and consumers? Spot Bitcoin ETFs are one very key way to do that.""  However, Salm said, there is also the possibility the SEC could “go back and continue to disapprove GBTC as an ETF on some new basis.” Or the SEC could rescind previously approved bitcoin futures ETFs. Salm said that outcome may come to fruition if the agency takes the stance of treating all bitcoin ETF products the same.  However, it is unlikely that the SEC will take that route, “given the amount of disruption” it would cause and the “lack of investor protections” that would result, Salm said.  Considering the SEC has already said it doesn't consider bitcoin to be a security, Salm said the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be the agency involved with bitcoin products.  ""We're all for more legislative actions that will bring more clarity to the asset class. Giving the SEC jurisdiction over spot bitcoin trading is not necessary to have a spot bitcoin ETF,"" he said. ""Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that very clearly is not a security, it's a commodity and that's been stated by SEC and CFTC officials over many years.  ""I think bitcoin as a commodity rightly belongs within CFTC jurisdiction,"" he said.

42415626,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JueH,1678307840,Crypto Trading Protocol Vertex Eyes Institutional Traders on Arbitrum,"With crypto trading activity picking up on Arbitrum, a new protocol called Vertex is setting its sights on the institutional clientele seeking to trade on decentralized exchanges (DEX) atop the Ethereum layer 2 system.  Vertex recently opened beta testing of its platform for spot and derivatives trading to a small group of institutional traders, said co-founder Darius Tabatabai, who declined to name names. For now the test is API-only, meaning those clients plug directly into Vertex’s trading engine rather than access it through a website.  The limited launch comes ahead of a wider debut expected for later in 2023. Then, Vertex will more directly take aim at Arbitrum DeFi leader GMX, which relies on user-supplied liquidity via automated market makers (AMM) to keep trades flowing. By contrast, Vertex employs an order book, the traditional setup found on centralized exchanges.  “You can never scale the way we’re planning to scale if you’re just AMM-driven,” Tabatabai said.  Vertex is the latest entrant to Arbitrum’s fast-growing decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. In the last 24 hours, decentralized exchanges on Arbitrum have processed over $300 million in volume, per DeFiLlama, second only to Ethereum. It’s the fourth-largest chain by total value locked and ahead of Optimism and Polygon.  In an interview, Tabatabai said GMX is unlikely to keep pace with the future growth of the Arbitrum ecosystem because GMX relies on a liquidity pool instead of market makers – a model that might not scale if the zeroes add up.  “With the mechanism as they have it set up, I can’t see it being bigger than, like, a billion dollars. And that means that they really will struggle to do more than, like, a couple of billion dollars a day of volume, which is really decent,” but not enough to beat a centralized exchange, he said.  GMX could not be immediately reached for comment.  By contrast, Tabatabai said, Vertex “will work as much like a centralized exchange platform as possible” despite being a DEX.

42415623,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5JuQ0,1678301704,"Embattled Crypto Lender Celsius Allocates $25M for Withdrawals, Burns $500M in WBTC","Crypto lender Celsius Network, which is currently operating under bankruptcy protection, has established a crypto wallet with $25 million of digital assets for Celsius’ custodial account holders to withdraw, blockchain intelligence firm Arkham Intelligence said in a report.  The transferred assets were $10.39 million of USDC stablecoin, $8.8 million of ether (ETH), $4.31 million of altcoins and $1.57 million of other stablecoin, including Binance USD, DAI, Paxos dollar and Gemini USD.  On Wednesday, Celsius interim Chief Executive Chris Ferraro said in a court hearing on Wednesday morning that custody account holders had withdrawn $17.7 million of these cryptocurrencies, with another $3.5 million of withdrawals in the process. That represents 60% of eligible custody users and 80% by crypto value, he said.  Celsius was among several one of the high-profile crypto firms that collapsed last year amid crypto market turmoil. The lender halted user withdrawals in June and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July. A subsequent court process involved heated debate about the ownership of the assets customers deposited to the platform.  The lender said on March 2 that it opened withdrawals for select custodial account holders with certain limitations after securing approval from the U.S. bankruptcy court. Celsius was authorized to distribute 94% of each eligible user's custody assets, according to a court document.  However, Arkham reported $13.62 million of withdrawals from the $25 million of funds based on blockchain transaction data. The other $4 million in withdrawals was likely in bitcoin (BTC), an Arkham analyst told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. Arkham does not track transaction data on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Read more: Crypto Lender Celsius Should Continue Exclusive Right to Pursue Novawulf Deal, Judge Says  Celsius' $500M wBTC maneuver  Celsius also burned some $500 million of wrapped bitcoin (wBTC) at the end of February, according to the Arkham report. A wBTC token represents one BTC on the Ethereum blockchain.  The lender sent over 20,000 of wBTC in two batches to a separate address, which then forwarded the tokens to crypto trading firm FalconX.  FalconX sent the tokens to another account, presumably owned by the Celsius liquidator or a partner. The entity then burned, in other words redeemed, the tokens for native BTC.  The maneuver may be part of Celsius’ plan to consolidate its crypto holdings and satisfy customer withdrawals in BTC. In August, CoinDesk reported the crypto lender was massively short of BTC holdings, owing some 105,000 BTC to customers while holding only 14,578 BTC and 23,348 wBTC on its balance sheet.  Celsius’ crypto wallets on the Ethereum blockchain hold more than $1 billion in crypto assets, according to Arkham data. This does not include holdings on other blockchains, including the recently redeemed BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain.  The lender’s largest holdings are $638 million of Lido’s staked ether derivative (stETH) and $251 million of the lender’s own CEL tokens.

The country’s financial regulator, the FCA currently has powers to ensure crypto companies register and comply with anti-money laundering rules, but it doesn't have the ability to protect consumers from any losses they might suffer. While the Financial Services and Markets Bill that’s currently under debate in parliament and is expected to become law in April will give the FCA more power to regulate crypto, consumer loss protection won’t be included.  “Whatever we do on regulation, we are not going to be able to put in place a framework that protects consumers from losses and we absolutely and under no circumstances whatsoever, should people expect compensation through this,” Rathi said.  Billions have been wiped out from the crypto market lately thanks to the collapse of sizable companies including FTX and Celsius Network. The FTX bankruptcy proceedings revealed that 80,000 U.K. crypto traders lost their funds due to that company's demise.  Also appearing at the hearing was newly appointed FCA chair, Ashley Adler, who said the crypto industry needed to “detoxify” and deserved “tough” regulatory oversight.  So far only 14% of crypto companies that have tried to register with the FCA have managed to win approval. Rathi called most of the applications “exceptionally” poor and said the agency needs to do a better job communicating its expectations – something it began to do in January.

42411195,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsMz,1678296608,The SEC's Custody Rule Would Be a Net Positive for Crypto,"The short timeline between the FTX exchange's collapse in November 2022 and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) vote in February 2023 to expand the types of digital assets included in the so-called Custody Rule shows that regulators are moving quickly to take actions they perceive will safeguard the crypto industry.  As much as regulators have been harped on by crypto insiders for not understanding the space and setting precedents that hamper innovation, requiring exchanges to separate custody from trading will be enormously positive for the future of crypto.  Mike Belshe is the CEO and co-founder of BitGo.  Crypto regulatory solutions outpacing traditional finance?  Modern traditional finance segregates business lines such as trading, financing and custody and uses a robust system of checks and balances. It therefore makes sense for digital assets to follow that same framework, learning from the past mistakes of traditional finance. Even when looking at a small subsection of the history of traditional finance regulation, the advancement from the FTX crash to sensible rulemaking about crypto custody happened much more quickly.  For example, in the years leading up to the stock market crash of October 1929 (the “Great Crash”), people bought stocks in large numbers and speculated by borrowing money to buy more shares. This worked as long as stock prices kept increasing, with the decade of the Roaring Twenties being one of a 10-year bull market with plenty of pump and dumps, insider trading and market manipulation.  When the crash occurred, people who’d bought their shares of stock on margin lost the value of their stock portfolio and owed money wherever they’d gone to borrow money to buy their stock. When people tried to withdraw their money from financial institutions, panic ensued and even the New York Bank of the United States collapsed.  See also: U.S. Lawmakers Argue SEC Accounting Policy Undermines Safe Crypto Custody  As a result of the lessons learned from the Great Crash, the SEC was created and consumer protections were instituted. The SEC's recent actions also reflect a reaction to lessons learned, and this proposed rule change is intended to bring order and protect market participants.  Forward-moving crypto regulation solutions  The SEC’s proposal that registered investment advisors be required to use an independent, regulated, qualified custodian is prudent and good for the digital asset industry. Qualified custodians, which have a fiduciary duty to clients, would hold client funds in segregated accounts. The custodian must also meet rigorous regulatory standards with audits to protect those funds.  Speaking as co-founder and chief executive of one of the cryptocurrency industry’s most important custodians, I propose additional constraints meant to protect investors:  Regulators should also require issuers of stablecoins to keep a 1:1 reserve at Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured banks. Although stablecoins are supposed to be redeemable with the assets that back them, no legal requirement exists for issuers to maintain proper reserves and to prevent rushes like what happened to the then-unregulated New York Bank. Requiring an audit of stablecoin reserves quarterly and real-time reporting on mint-and-burn activities would be a sensible step.  Make all exchanges on-chain auditable. This measure will take proof-of-reserve statements from a partial solution that provides some transparency to a more complete one. FTX blended its digital asset holdings with fiat and let liabilities significantly exceed those reserves with highly undesirable results. Going further with the idea, the government could even create a digital registry of debt on a blockchain.  See also: Coinbase, Anchorage Digital Say They'd Be OK Under SEC Proposal  Although no one would have ever wished for an FTX collapse, this same type of crash had spurred necessary rule-making and role delineations in traditional finance to protect investors.

Judge Martin Glenn said sufficient progress had been made in preparing a deal to set up a new recovery corporation with a new company, NovaWulf.  Agreeing to the deal could mean the crypto lender exits bankruptcy protection by the end of June, within a year of collapsing in 2022, the Southern District Court in New York was told.  “I'm going to grant the requested extension of exclusivity,” Judge Glenn said, despite complaints from the U.S. government and creditors that liquidating the company’s assets could still prove an option.  Celsius has been able to fill in details of the deal and isn’t burning through customer funds in the interim, Glenn said, urging lawyers to ensure the plan, due to be presented to creditors for their approval, is written in plain English.  Celsius appears confident a speedy resolution is still possible. On current timelines “that would mean that Celsius would be in and out of bankruptcy in under one year,” Christopher Koenig of Kirkland & Ellis, representing the bankrupt company, told the court.  Celsius’ interim chief executive officer, Chris Ferraro, also offered an update on the return of funds held in Custody accounts, which Glenn in December ruled belonged to customers rather than the estate.  As of Tuesday, $17.7 million had already been withdrawn from the custody accounts, with a further $3.5 million in progress, representing 60% of eligible users and 80% by value, Ferraro said.

42411205,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsk8,1678295250,Let’s Talk About Crypto Protocol Layers and Why Investors Must Examine Them,"Finding new and profitable investment ideas is the unending task facing any investor or allocator of capital. While bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) dominate the discussion around cryptocurrencies, the opportunity set for investors expands well beyond.  Some of those candidates are, however, intrinsically tied to the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, borne out of the need to enhance their capabilities. Bitcoin and Ethereum are known as layer 1 (L1) protocols, and these attempts to scale and expand them are called layer 2s (L2).  An L1’s value stems from “blockspace,” territory on a blockchain where information or a smart contract lives. BTC, ETH and tokens for other L1s are valued based on demand for that. They are, so to speak, the tickets to a dance and cost more when more people want to attend; one reason to buy is because you expect higher prices later due to people scrambling to get in the door.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Bitcoin lets people engage in peer-to-peer transactions; the price of BTC rises with demand for that. Ethereum and similar L1 protocols grant people access to smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and, eventually, stuff we can’t currently envision; ETH and its peers ride along with that.  But blockspace is scarce. And Ethereum, the biggest smart contract-based layer 1, cannot handle anything close to the volume seen elsewhere in finance. It can process a few dozen transactions per second, trailing the Visa network or New York Stock Exchange by several orders of magnitude – a big obstacle to decentralized finance (DeFi) taking over traditional finance tasks.  So, if a layer 1 protocol is a room people are rushing to get into, imagine a long line at the door and skyrocketing price of admission. That’s where layer 2s come in. They act like an overflow room at a convention. If you can’t get into the main auditorium to see the hot keynote speaker, you can get into a side room with a TV screen showing their speech and meet with other attendees.  An L2 is similar. It is a place where transactions can be offloaded from the L1 for faster and/or cheaper processing, but the trades are intrinsically linked to and can be fed back into the L1. If an L1 is a room people want to get into, L2s represent the construction of new ways to get inside, allowing broader access and reducing congestion.  For Ethereum, well-known layer 2 protocols include Polygon, Arbitrum and Optimism. For Bitcoin, there’s Stacks.  Like their L1 counterparts, L2 protocols generally have their own native token, which serves as an incentive to use the network. As an investor, I view a layer 2 as an investment in the infrastructure that allows greater access to the main room, while providing space for developers to build new and useful things. And so even if I don’t know what those useful things are yet, I know that more levels and doorways are needed in the building itself. Knowing that, I want to invest in the materials that will provide the new infrastructure.  Let’s examine a few:  Polygon is the first layer 2 platform that comes to mind for most. Acting as a scaling system, the platform lets developers build decentralized applications on Ethereum. It’s much faster, capable of about 65,000 transactions per second versus 30 on Ethereum. JPMorgan generated buzz last year by doing a DeFi trade using Polygon. Its native token, MATIC, currently has a $9.8 billion market capitalization and revenue of $47 million. Year to date, MATIC is up 48%.  Immutable X operates as a scaling system for non-fungible tokens (NFT), aiming to address high gas fees and slow processing times. Its native token, IMX, lags behind MATIC in market capitalization at $880 million. The dispersion between the two highlights both MATIC’s significant market share and the potential opportunity for the tokens that fall behind it. Year to date, IMX is up 173%.  Stacks has made quite a splash in the past month or so. While Polygon and Immutable X help Ethereum scale, it is focused on Bitcoin, where it has enabled NFTs known as Ordinals. Stacks has expanded Bitcoin beyond just peer-to-peer transactions, which has, for good reason, caught the eye of the crypto community. Its native token, STX, leads all crypto assets with market caps in excess of $1 billion in year-to-date performance (up 254%).  The layer 2 list certainly doesn’t stop here. Optimism (OP), Loopring (LRC) and numerous others are designed to increase utility within the crypto ecosystem. Also, Arbitrum has gained major traction as an Ethereum L2, having recently surpassed it in terms of number of transactions in a 24-hour period.  The success or failure of these projects will be determined over time, but the impact, opportunity and access they provide should be on everyone’s mind.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  SILVERGATE SAGA: New week, new source of trouble. Crypto bank Silvergate said it’s on shaky financial footing by giving the dreaded “going concern” warning. But something else it did might matter more to the institutional community: It closed the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), a platform that helped traditional finance (TradFi) players tie into crypto exchanges. It was a “24/7 instant settlement service the bank's clients could use to conduct transactions between each other at any time, including nights and weekends,” according to a recent CoinDesk story. It was an important service given so much of TradFi is not 24/7; this was a vital bridge. Signature Bank's Signet is an alternative, though, and BCB Group is rushing to add features to help fill the gap.  COURT BOMBSHELL: Courtrooms generally aren’t as exciting as they’re portrayed in movies and on TV. But the Voyager Digital bankruptcy case got spicy last week when a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official said agency staff believe Binance.US is an unregistered securities exchange. While the SEC’s five commissioners would have to back that statement for it to have any teeth, in the dense thicket of Washington regulation-ese this counts as high drama and a big allegation.  ANOTHER BOMBSHELL: SEC Chair Gary Gensler rejected the idea that exchanges could be safe custodians of crypto assets. ""Based upon how crypto trading and lending platforms generally operate, investment advisers cannot rely on them today as qualified custodians,"" he said at a recent meeting. ""To be clear: Just because a crypto trading platform claims to be a qualified custodian doesn’t mean that it is."" The government crypto crackdown is getting real, real fast.  COINBASE DEAL: Coinbase has acquired One River Digital Asset Management, an institutional crypto asset manager and SEC-registered investment adviser. This is approximately item number 19,362 on the list of examples over the years of TradFi and crypto intersecting (or trying to), but arguably one of the bigger ones. What Coinbase bought is an onramp for conventional finance players to get into crypto. Conventional finance players actually getting into crypto in a big way remains the elusive Holy Grail, but Coinbase is positioning itself for if/when that finally happens.

42411194,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsJg,1678295054,Paul Krugman Is Having a Bitcoin Moment,"Paul Krugman has been rugged by a centralized payments provider. Maybe he’s learning something new about the value of Bitcoin.  This morning, Wednesday March 8, the Nobel Prize-winning economist and longtime crypto skeptic took to Twitter to announce that the payments app Venmo has seemingly blacklisted him. And even he – one of the most famous and influential economic analysts on the planet – wasn’t getting any help, or even an explanation of the block, from the centralized platform’s customer service.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “The software has taken control,” Krugman plaintively bleated.  It’s a delicious moment for cryptocurrency advocates. One of their self-appointed adversaries has had his pants pulled down by the exact problem they’ve continually warned about: the threat of capricious, seemingly arbitrary financial censorship in the digital age.  And Venmo isn’t just any centralized payments tool: It’s one of the worst out there from a privacy perspective. Venmo sets new users’ transactions and notes to display publicly, by default, as part of its broader, deeply misguided goal of being a kind of social network for payments.  “We make it [public by] default because it’s fun to share [information] with friends in the social world,” a Venmo representative told CNET in 2021. “People open up Venmo to see what their family and friends are up to.”  This is quite obviously irresponsible, even malicious product design (though it has led to a few moments of incredible comedy). Krugman’s apparent openness to using such an anti-privacy product suggests he doesn’t spend a lot of time thinking about the issue.  But his shock at being suddenly deplatformed is even more revealing of his enduring biases. As Bitcoin advocates in his replies are crawling over each other to point out, while this may be an edge case for Americans and Europeans it’s an everyday reality for many residents of developing or unstable regions.  Shortly after the initial tweet, Krugman followed up to announce that “tweeting got results” and his account “seem[s] to be up again.” This is hardly a vindication for Venmo – to the contrary, it’s a further demonstration of just how much Western elite privilege is baked into dismissals of uncensorable financial tools. It isn’t even clear whether Venmo reps were able to offer Krugman an explanation for his brief banning, highlighting the constant and opaque risk such services present.  See also: Coinbase-OFAC Bug Affected Fewer Than 100 People and Has Been Fixed  One might also ask Krugman exactly why he was being blocked from using Venmo. He himself has in the past argued that “unless you’re buying drugs, assassinations, etc.,” “trusting a third party” for payments is “not a big deal.”  Personally, I’ve got a lot of respect for Krugman’s economic commentary and his public advocacy on a wide array of subjects.

42411201,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLsgp,1678294800,Crypto Rails Should Bring Efficiency Gains to the $7T-a-Day TradFi FX Market,"Crypto prices are wobbling amid Silvergate Bank’s woes and the U.S. government’s regulation-by-enforcement campaign. But I’m looking past that, thinking about the likely future collision of crypto and the legacy plumbing of finance and markets. How will they interact? What efficiencies will result from deploying the best of both worlds? What happens to existing over-the-counter and private markets? What real-world assets will shift to on-chain trading?  A recent paper from Uniswap Labs, the decentralized-finance (DeFi) titan, and stablecoin giant Circle previews that future.  The authors studied the first six months of trading on a Uniswap liquidity pool that contains USD coin (USDC) and euro coin (EUROC). (It launched in July.) More than $120 million traded through the automated market maker (AMM), which provided liquidity 24/7 without a hiccup during the depths of crypto winter.  Sure, there’s only $1.32 million in total value locked (TVL). But something significant is afoot here as two fiat-backed stablecoins get swapped efficiently and without fanfare on chain.  The traditional currency market is something like a $7 trillion-a-day, mostly over-the-counter business. It’s opaque and complex. There’s no official prices. And an estimated one-third of all volume (about $2 trillion daily) has settlement risk, according to a 2022 Bank for International Settlements survey.  Meanwhile, this USDC/EUROC pool completed transactions on a public ledger, and did it really efficiently. During the study period, prices stuck within a few basis points of the conventional EUR/USD exchange rate. There was weekend liquidity, a time when the traditional FX spot market goes dark. And there were fewer intermediaries and their associated fees and frictions. Automation worked.  Decentralized finance “can reduce remittance costs by as much as 80[%] relative to banks and money transmitters relying on traditional payment systems,” the study authors wrote. That amounts to “a gain of around $30 billion per year going to households” most reliant on remittance payments from families across borders, they added.  While a lowly USDC/EUROC stablecoin liquidity pool might seem like a rather mundane example of crypto in action, it points to the numerous benefits, increased efficiencies of a blockchain future. Don’t overlook that amid the day-to-day of crypto price action.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Todd Groth,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/03/08/crypto-rails-should-bring-efficiency-gains-to-the-7t-a-day-tradfi-fx-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ea072d1cf49de25b8cd4f8c8f5621c9972f6e7f9-7360x4912.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Testifying before the House Financial Services Committee for his semi-annual monetary policy report on Wednesday, Powell made a notable change (from Tuesday's Senate testimony) in his prepared remarks. ""I stress that no decision has been made on this,"" Powell added Wednesday when talking about the pace of rate hikes.  Markets on Tuesday took Powell's prepared remarks as suggesting the Fed was likely to hike rates 50 basis points at the FOMC's March meeting instead of the previously assumed 25. Bitcoin and stocks both saw sizable declines and the dollar a powerful rally following the testimony. The insertion of the ""no decision"" wording Wednesday could be an attempt to soothe those hawkish fears.  Bitcoin (BTC) bounced more than $200 on the news, now back above $22,000 at $22,200, and the S&P 500 moved from a modest loss to a modest gain. The dollar is giving back some of Tuesday's sizable advance.  Powell said there's a number of important economic reports to be released between now and the FOMC's March 21-22 meeting – this Friday's February payrolls report and next week's inflation figures among them – and the incoming data will play an important role in guiding the rate decision.  While crypto came up during Wednesday's hearing, it was not a major issue even among lawmakers who tend to be outspoken on the sector.  Powell did say the Fed had yet to make any decisions on issuing a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) in response to a lawmaker's questions.  ""We're not making any real decisions, we're doing kind of early stage experimentation – how would this work? Does it work? What's the best technology, what's efficient – early stage, but we're making progress on technological issues,"" he said.  Nikhilesh De contributed reporting.

42421083,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRm1,1678286741,Women Are Being Shut Out Of Web3; These Women Are Building Anyway,"While women continue to make up a significant portion of active Web3 users, there aren’t enough women building in Web3 due to structural and social barriers.  According to a recent study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and diversity-focused innovation studio People of Crypto Lab, only 13% of Web3 startups include a female founder, and women represent just 27% of the top Web3 startups’ workforce. In comparison, women in large tech companies hold roughly 32% of jobs. In the financial services sector, women start on equal ground but get squeezed out over time, holding half of entry-level positions but only 19% of C-suite roles, according to research by Deloitte and McKinsey.  “I’ve been fighting sexism, racism and homophobia since I was six years old,” said Alicia Cepeda Maule, co-founder and CEO of Givepact, a fundraising platform that enables nonprofits to accept crypto payments. “As a ‘non-technical’ Afro-Colombian female founder of a Web3 company, all the odds are against me. Black women receive less than 1% of [venture capital] money,” Maule said.  Maule says that she tends to enter professional arenas with the understanding that she must work harder than men, and often with fewer resources. “The stakes are even higher,” she said. “I have to perform at 100% and overdeliver in every single pitch and interaction that I make for the company.”  The BCG study backs up Maule’s observations, finding that Web3 startups founded by men raise almost four times more capital than those founded by women.  Despite the challenges, women around the world are still choosing to participate in Web3, the newest frontier of tech and finance combined. Some – roughly 7%, according to the BCG study – have founded companies. Yet, women are largely isolated from leadership positions and venture capital opportunities, making it difficult to participate equally in foundational conversations that will determine Web3’s standards.  Many women in the industry recognize this peril: “There's not enough of us, said Bozena Rezab, co-founder and CEO of blockchain-based mobile gaming platform GAMEE. Rezab argues this moment is a “great opportunity” for women to consider Web3 as a career.  Ahead, we spoke to women across Web3 sectors about why they are pursuing a blockchain-based career and how they continue to build around the obstacles presented.  Focus on making positive changes  Gender bias presents itself across digital and real-world industries, leading many women to expect inequality in professional settings. “There is probably always going to be some level of bias or stereotype to overcome, not necessarily only related to gender,” said Rezab, who explained she tries to ignore such encounters by focusing on her goals and performance. “I am focused on results,” she said.  Some women find it helpful to focus on the fact that Web3 attracts entrepreneurial professionals who appreciate innovation. This combination of traits can foster an open-mindedness not always welcome in traditional finance or tech startups. Web3, therefore, may appear like an environment that is comparatively more equitable, despite what the data suggests.  “Compared to the traditional side of finance, people are more helpful here,” said Beryl Li, co-founder of play-to-earn gaming network Yield Guild Games (YGG), adding that “as an entrepreneur, you create your own culture.”  Li, who works with multiple women on her team at YGG, describes feeling comfortable and supported in her role thanks to intentional hiring, recruiting and partnership practices. “I work with incredible women who’ve been very helpful,” said Li. “You need to look for people who actually respect you and compliment your skills.”  Web3 investor and Ola Guild Games co-founder Clara Bullrich describes this strategy as creating a “bubble of trust.”  “What I found effective is to focus on my work and to be reliant on what I can change, as opposed to whatever is outside of my control,” Bullrich said. “I am trying to create and promote that mindset among others around me.”  Find a supportive community  Community is at the heart of Web3, and finding a supportive and like-minded network of professionals and peers is important for all builders in the space.  “Web3 centers and thrives on community,” said Maule. “You can have a great product and tons of investment, but if you don’t center your community, you won’t go as far.”  Devon Martens, principal blockchain engineer at the non-fungible token (NFT) platform Sweet, appreciates the in-real-life conferences, meetups and events that bring women builders across the world together. “There are active movements in order to support women in crypto,” she said. “That feels good to me.”  According to the BCG study, the proportion of women who speak at Web3 conferences is three times higher than men, a statistic that suggests women are growing in visibility at Web3 conferences, which may be an important first step in achieving true equity across leadership and founder roles.  Maule also appreciates the numerous organizations and women-led communities that promote education and diversity in Web3. She recommends that newcomers familiarize themselves with groups including SheFi, Web3 Familia, Black@, Boys Club, Blu3 DAO, H.E.R. DAO and Friends With Benefits.  Fill technical roles in a male-dominated field  The BCG study showed that women founders are more likely to launch Web3 startups in creative and social segments, although technical roles are still dominated by men. Just 12% of technical roles in Web3 are filled by women, representing less than the number of women in technical roles across other STEM fields.  Still, blockchain is what Maggie Love, founder of the global education community SheFi, once described as “inherently feminist.” The idea of a borderless, permissionless financial network where anyone – regardless of their credit score, occupation, experience level or net worth – can participate, is more inclusive than the traditional finance (TradFi) industry, making blockchain development a worthwhile skill for women to learn.  Martins says she began learning Solidity, a programming language for writing smart contracts, by watching free videos on YouTube. She explained that traditional coding boot camps may cost up to five figures in tuition, but thanks to the growth of Web3, blockchain education is often crowdsourced and free.  “Occasionally, a chain will sponsor a course for people to learn,” she said. “You can also start with just YouTube videos. [The channel] Eat The Blocks has some free ones, and they're also a relatively low-cost boot camp.”  Lisa Seacat DeLuca, senior director of engineering at the decentralized domain service Unstoppable Domains and former IBM executive, shares Martins’ perspective: “These days with everything being open source, you can see examples of other people's contracts,” she said. “I think it's easier to onboard in Web3 than it is in Web2. As far as software engineering and the talent you're looking for, it's very similar.”  DeLuca, whose portfolio includes over 800 patent applications and who was recognized by IBM as one of the most prolific inventors in the company's history, wrote her first smart contract over Christmas in 2022.  Foster collaboration in Web3  Each of the women interviewed for this article stressed the importance of collaboration in Web3. Like any healthy ecosystem, collaborative work environments are strengthened when more points of view are represented.  “It’s not just gender,” said Leah Callon Butler, director of blockchain consulting firm Emfarsis. “We need diversity in terms of race and ethnicity, culture, religion, age, sexuality and so on.”  DeLuca agrees: “You could have a bunch of women in the room, and you're still missing out if everybody's got the same mindset and are approaching the problems in the same way,” she said.  Although representation may be the first step, the workplace must also be conducive to healthy and productive exchanges between those with differing perspectives. The BCG study outlines five measures that can help address the gender imbalance and foster a more inclusive workforce among Web3 companies. These measures include prioritizing data that represents diversity across company departments and leadership levels, including women and non-binary people on investment teams, designing accessible brand experiences, building supportive environments and shaping regulation that champions diversity, equity and inclusion of all types.  “When we lack diversity, we have fewer perspectives to draw upon, which means that challenges are not fully understood, opportunities are overlooked, and the solutions we develop are less robust,” said Callon-Butler. “The more diverse we are, the more angles we can see the world. Ultimately, this is better for everyone.”  As Web3 continues to shift and grow, women have the power to usher in a more diverse and inclusive space that can represent the ideas and values of a broad range of communities.  “Women are natural leaders and organizers, and soon we will represent at least half of crypto holders worldwide,” said Maule. “There is no Web3 without us.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING | RESEARCH,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2023/03/08/women-are-being-shut-out-of-web3-these-women-are-building-anyway,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/22b6dd788f0bf0b3aa5642e1f774cd6c58524f3a-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

STG is down 7.9% over the past 24 hours, according to Cryptowatch.  In an email to clients, Coinbase said all trading will be suspended on March 14 at 12 p.m. ET. For now, said the email, STG trading has been moved to limit-only mode, which means that users can't market buy or market sell – they can only add orders to the book.  The decision to delist Stargate Finance, which is built by LayerZero Labs, comes one week before the protocol is migrating the token to a new smart contract. Users holding STG in self-custodied wallets will be airdropped an equivalent amount of STG v2 tokens. Coinbase said that it will not airdrop its users the newly-issued token.  Today's decline adds to the trend lower over the past eight days, with STG now off 38.5% over that period to the current 71 cents. Prior to this bearish action, STG had made a sizable move higher in February, in part thanks to a tie-up with Avalanche-based decentralized exchange Trader Joe.

The service could be used by gaming apps where tokens or non-fungible tokens (NFT) are part of the game, or by companies that might want to incorporate a wallet into an app and make that “almost invisible to the end user,” Patrick McGregor, Coinbase’s head of product for Web3 developer platforms, said in an interview.  The announcement comes as Coinbase pushes to provide more products and services to blockchain developers – in addition to the consumers who use the exchange and Coinbase Wallet, and the institutional investors who use its trading and custody products.  “We view this as being the central enabling technology and revenue source for our developer strategy,” McGregor said. Fees will be charged on a per-wallet basis, he said.  Coinbase says its wallet-as-a-service could help companies “to help bring the next hundred million customers into Web3 through a seamless wallet-onboarding experience,” according to a press release.  Traditional crypto wallets are “difficult for users to access” because of their “complex mnemonic seeds” and “counterintuitive” user interfaces, Coinbase said. “In a world where wallets are simple, companies can finally build Web3 experiences accessible to everyone regardless of technical knowledge.”  The use of complicated 24-word recovery phrases is avoided through the use of “multi-party computation” cryptographic technology.  “MPC allows a ‘key’ to be split between the end user and Coinbase,” according to the press release. “Ultimately, this means if a company’s end user loses access to their device, the key to their Web3 wallet is still safe and can be securely restored.”  Read more: MPC Explained: The Bold New Vision for Securing Crypto Money",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/08/coinbase-starts-wallet-as-a-service-that-companies-can-build-into-their-own-apps,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/32da388474a504bcc9fcb33001d9c1ef6fd0c19e-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413899,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboAlssm,1678284000,DeFi Protocol Maverick Unveils UniSwap Rival Decentralized Exchange on Ethereum,"Decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Maverick Protocol has unveiled its decentralized exchange (DEX) on Ethereum, the protocol’s developer team told CoinDesk Wednesday.  The protocol is powered by a native smart-contract-based, automated market making (AMM) engine the Maverick team had been building for over a year and lets investors earn more revenue than on UniSwap, one of the top DEXs, Bob Baxley, Maverick’s chief technology officer, told CoinDesk in an interview.  Maverick’s latest addition comes in an increasingly competitive space as investors seek decentralized trading venues after the FTX exchange’s spectacular demise and concerns about the stability of centralized exchanges.  DEXs are built around liquidity pools, where traders can exchange assets while investors – also called liquidity providers – earn rewards from transaction fees for providing liquidity to make a market. Liquidity distribution is the price range where investors deploy their capital for the pair of assets in the liquidity pool. Naturally, investors are attracted to deploy their capital on protocols with higher, steadier rewards.  Maverick started with six liquidity pools, fundamental building blocks of DEXs similar to trading pairs on centralized exchanges, with more than $10 million of combined size to trade tokens of the largest liquid staking protocol Lido Finance, decentralized stablecoin issuer Liquity and web3 identity data network Galxe.  Higher capital efficiency  Maverick’s novelty is its dynamic automated market maker behind the protocol, which lets investors capture more fees and maximize revenues from providing liquidity with a customizable liquidity distribution tool.  Instead of standard liquidity distribution, liquidity providers on Maverick can automate their own distribution range and bet on the future price of the liquidity pool’s assets.  With that, investors’ capital can work more efficiently covering wider price movements, with less inactive periods when their capital is sitting idle because the asset price is out of range.  “If liquidity providers in existing AMMs want to keep their capital as active as possible, they are forced to adjust their liquidity positions hourly, costing them time and gas,” Baxley said. “By giving LPs the option to choose if and how their liquidity moves with price in a given pool – something that no other AMM does natively – Maverick enables markets to run more efficiently, resulting in more consistent fee generation.”  In a backtest for last month, Maverick claimed the strategy reached 1,195% of average capital efficiency without any inactive periods, which translates to about ten times more potential income for liquidity providers compared to UniSwap.  Liquidity pools for stablecoins, liquid staking derivatives  At the beginning, crypto traders can access six liquidity pools on Maverick with an initial liquidity – total value locked (TVL) – of more than $10 million.  Maverick integrated the popular liquid staking protocol Lido Finance, making its wrapped ether derivative a key asset in the pools.  On top of the wstETH/ETH pool, Maverick also partnered with decentralized stablecoin issuer Liquity to offer trading pools for its LUSD stablecoin against ETH and wstETH, and with Galxe for a wstETH/GAL pool.  Those investors who deposit wstETH into the pools may also earn the derivative’s staking reward as well as the usual revenue by providing liquidity.  Additionally, the protocol hosts a USDC/USDT stablecoin pool and ETH/USDC pool.  DEX competition  During a torrid last year for centralized crypto trading platforms, highlighted by the spectacular collapse of FTX, the resiliency of decentralized alternatives spurred interest in DEXs. However, less-than-user-friendly interfaces and occasionally subpar efficiency has stifled their emergence, executing only 5% of the daily trading volume of centralized exchanges.  Currently, decentralized exchanges compensate for the largest sector within DeFi, with a combined $18.8 billion of total value locked on the protocols, according to data from DefiLlama. The leading platforms are UniSwap and the stablecoin-focused swap protocol Curve Finance.  “Our goal is to be among the top five decentralized exchanges by volume within the next six months,” Baxley said.  The protocol’s developer firm raised $9 million of venture capital from backers including Circle Ventures, LedgerPrime and Jump Crypto, according to Crunchbase, with Pantera Capital being the latest investor last year, Maverick added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING | TRADING,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/08/defi-protocol-maverick-unveils-uniswap-rival-decentralized-exchange-on-ethereum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b0f53472916718bcb4150936a5c514ce67576dc-1920x1080.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Called Code Canvas, the platform will allow creators and collectors to mint and trade generative art NFTs on the Solana blockchain. Similar to flagship Ethereum-based generative art platform Art Blocks, Code Canvas will curate primary drops, as well as secondary sales of Solana-based generative art NFTs.  Adam Karren, chief product officer of Code Canvas, told CoinDesk he’s excited to bring generative art, an art form born in the 20th century that’s been revitalized through blockchain technology, to the growing Solana NFT ecosystem.  “We're super-excited because there's just such a robust pipeline of artists that are wanting to come [to Solana] for various reasons,” said Karren. “Affordability to actually mint on-chain, speed and user experience are top of mind.”  Karren said he’s hoping to court artists native to the Ethereum and Tezos fine art ecosystems. The platform’s first two collections will be released by Tezos-native generative artists Leander Herzog on March 8, followed by a drop from StudioYorktown on March 22.  Additionally, Code Canvas aims to reward creators and their loyal fans though CoCa passes, which grants holders lifetime access to NFT drops as well as minting services.  “We're trying to really help the artist win and help the collectors and support those artists because we're not we're not trying to make this a speculative asset,” said Karren. “We're really trying to create a more committed community and a more committed collector base.”  Code Canvas also plans to enforce royalties on Solana, standing with creators and their earnings.

Analysts now expect the Fed to eventually raise its benchmark interest to as high as 5.65%. A month ago, the expectation was for the rate to peak at 4.9%.  Binance.US cleared a major hurdle in its effort to acquire the assets of bankrupt crypto lender Voyager Digital in a deal worth over $1 billion after Michael Wiles, a U.S. bankruptcy judge in the Southern District of New York, overruled objections to the proposed acquisition. While the judge said he would still work through the confirmation order, he indicated he was in favor of approving the deal. Binance.US may still have to clear certain regulatory hurdles before the deal can be completed. Voyager's VGX token surged over 8% in the minutes after the ruling.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust's (GBTC) discount to the net asset value of the trust's shares has narrowed to 35%, the lowest level since Nov. 7, following what seemed to be a favorable court hearing on Tuesday for Grayscale Investments. The discount narrowed to just below 35% after the hearing where a panel of appeals court judges appeared to be skeptical about the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's arguments in rejecting Grayscale’s bid to convert the trust into an exchange-traded fund. The judges questioned the SEC's logic in distinguishing between bitcoin spot market prices and futures market prices. The SEC has approved ETFs for bitcoin futures. Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by crypto conglomerate Digital Currency Group.     Chart of the Day  The chart compares bitcoin's annualized three-month basis, or the difference between futures and spot market prices, on offshore exchanges such as Binance, OKX and Deribit with that on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  The premium on the CME has dropped sharply to 2.2% over the past week.  ""The falling futures basis further suggests that CME selling sent BTC lower during the sell-off,"" K33's research analysts said in a note sent to clients.  Bitcoin has pulled back from $25,000 to $22,000 amid issues at crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, operational bottlenecks at major exchanges and macroeconomic uncertainty.

42411184,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glLrjJ,1678280061,Crypto Could Flatten the Digital Gender Gap,"Cryptocurrency and digital finance tools such as security tokens, non-fungible tokens (NFT) and central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are revolutionizing the financial industry, providing individuals with new and innovative ways to invest, transact and store value.  While these tools have garnered significant attention for their potential to disrupt traditional finance, their impact on women has been somewhat overlooked. However, as these technologies continue to gain traction, they could provide transformative benefits to women around the world and financial inclusion as a whole.  Maia Naor is chief product officer and Itai Avneri is deputy chief executive and chief operating officer of INX.  Digital finance tools have the potential to increase financial inclusion for women, who are often excluded from traditional financial systems. According to a report by the World Bank, women are nearly 10% less likely than men to have a bank account, and in some regions, the gender gap is even wider.  This lack of financial access can have significant consequences, limiting women’s ability to invest, save and participate in the economy.  See also: Women Who Web3 | Podcast  Women stand to benefit the most  Cryptocurrency and digital finance tools can help overcome some of these barriers. For example, they can facilitate cross-border transactions without the need for intermediaries or traditional banking systems. This can be especially beneficial for women in developing countries, who may not have access to traditional financial institutions.  Additionally, digital finance tools can enable micro-investing, democratizing finance and allowing women to invest small amounts of money in assets they believe in, without having to meet the high minimum investment requirements of traditional finance.  Security tokens, too, can provide women with new investment opportunities. These tools enable the fractional ownership of assets that were previously inaccessible, such as real estate, artwork and more.  By enabling women to invest, crypto is helping diversify both investment portfolios and finance itself.  Inclusion and autonomy for women in the digital age  Another potential benefit of cryptocurrency and digital finance tools is the ability to provide women with greater financial autonomy. Traditional financial systems are often patriarchal, and women may be subject to the financial conditions of their husbands and other male family members. By using digital finance tools, women can take control of their finances, invest in assets and participate in the economy on their own terms.  CBDCs, digital versions of traditional fiat currencies that are issued and backed by central banks, can also be an important tool for women’s financial inclusion. These currencies can be stored and transacted using digital wallets, and potentially be used to provide financial access to underserved communities.  Although CBDCs are mostly experimental at this stage, they have the potential to make financial services more accessible, affordable and secure for women in developing countries. These are places that Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said face the greatest barriers to financial inclusion.  In addition to increasing financial inclusion, CBDCs can also improve financial security for women. Because they are digital, CBDCs can be easily stored and accessed using a mobile device, reducing the need for physical cash and thereby, potentially, making women less vulnerable to theft or violence.  There are plenty of examples of women already taking advantage of the digital economy the world over, including the following:  Ukrainian women have turned to crypto to avoid the obvious problems with carrying large amounts of cash and/or trying to access bank accounts locally or abroad. Reports indicate that Ukrainian refugee women in particular are using crypto so they can convert it into fiat currency in a new country. Underscoring this widespread usage and need for a borderless digital currency, late last year the United Nations enabled an aid initiative for war-affected people in Ukraine, including millions of women, using stablecoins.  Women-owned businesses often lack investment capital. According to a study by McKinsey, U.S. women received only 2.8% of venture capital funding in 2019 and 2.3% in 2020. Many women are now using cryptocurrencies to raise money quickly for their businesses, ventures and ideas. In addition, women are creating digital literacy communities to teach each other how to use this technology.  Female entrepreneurs in Africa are leveraging cryptocurrency for broader financial access for their startups and businesses. For example, a platform called KureCoinHub provides a way for women to access loans and make cross-border payments using digital currencies like bitcoin. In addition to crypto, African countries like Ghana are aggressively pursuing CBDCs that could ultimately bolster the number of female entrepreneurs. Afua Adubea Koranteng, the co-founder and managing partner of Koranteng & Koranteng Legal Advisors, a corporate and commercial law firm in Accra, Ghana, said that “CBDCs could serve as a catalyst in bridging the digital and financial divide faced by women and young entrepreneurs.”  The World of Women NFT project (WoW) is a collection that features 10,000 unique, diverse and powerful women avatars who take great pride in making a positive impact and helping people, especially women who are new NFTs  These are just a few examples of how cryptocurrency and digital finance tools are being used to support women. We know that these examples will explode in growth as more innovative use cases emerge.  See also: What Is World Of Women? Everything to Know About the NFT Project Champioining Diversity  Flattening digital gender divide  Still, the fact remains that too many people, both men and women, do not have access to the internet and the digital devices they need to benefit from a digitizing economy. Women, particularly in developing countries, may not have the same level of access to digital devices and the internet as men. According to a report by the International Telecommunication Union, the gender gap in internet use is highest in the least developed countries, where women are 33% less likely to use the internet than men.  There are no easy solutions to this issue, but it’s said only to show that the spread of digital technologies that flatten hierarchies and raise up the underserved is not always level.

42410829,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrthi,1678276800,Gitcoin’s Owocki Says Crypto Can Regenerate the World. Just Don’t Call Him Starry-Eyed,"DENVER – It’s easy these days to be a crypto cynic. From the Terra blockchain’s crash to the hedge fund Three Arrows Capital’s collapse and the FTX exchange’s bust, the industry’s leaders sure seem to have a knack for disappointing investors.  After a year of fraud and catastrophe, ETHDenver, the year’s largest gathering for the Ethereum ecosystem, concluded its four-day run last week in Colorado.  The conference came amid a Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown on crypto companies. Under the leadership of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, regulators have been suggesting more frequently that many cryptocurrencies might be unregistered securities, with bitcoin perhaps as the lone exception.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  But according to Kevin Owocki, the Gitcoin co-founder who now helms a newly established Web3 venture studio called supermodular, Gensler’s got it all wrong. Though Owocki’s view on securities law is not based in any formal legal training, it’s born out of a crypto optimism that fits right in at ETHDenver, where other bright-eyed crypto optimists gathered to espouse the virtues of blockchain technology.  'Regenerative Projects'  Long at the core of Ethereum’s social impact movement has been Gitcoin – a kind of fundraising collective that awards grants to community-oriented projects and infrastructure. Recently, Gitcoin open-sourced its fundraising tools so they can be leveraged by other crypto communities looking to bring in cash.  Owocki is a programmer by trade and training; according to his LinkedIn profile, he got a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Delaware, where his interests included ultimate frisbee. He has been in the Ethereum community since its early days, founding Gitcoin in 2017 as a way to wield blockchain primitives like smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) to solve what he calls “human coordination failures.”  Owocki’s goal with Gitcoin, and now supermodular, is to “engineer a movement of capital and talent and attention from degenerative product projects like pump-and-dumps and Ponzi schemes to regenerative projects,” he told CoinDesk.  “I kind of think of the way I frame it is: How do we rotate capital and attention and talent and resources from degenerative projects, which are ‘number go down,’ to regenerative projects,” explained Owocki. “Regen is ‘number go up,’ positive sum games.” In other words, it’s about creating projects that add value rather than extract or reshuffle value.  While Gitcoin has pulled in over $70 million to fund “regenerative” social impact projects, Owocki admits there’s plenty of work to do before crypto can be deemed a positive for society.  “The title of my [ETHDenver] talk is ‘How crypto can regenerate the world,’” Owocki said, placing special emphasis on the word “can.”  “Nothing grinds my gears more than when I get to put on a panel that’s called ‘How crypto is regenerating the world.’ It's not yet. Look at the harm that has been caused by SBF and Do Kwon.”  Why the SEC should love DAOs  In an interview with CoinDesk, Owocki delivered a breathless explanation spanning evolutionary science, economics and legal theory. This would eventually circle back to the topic of securities regulation.  At one point, he pulled up a chart on his laptop showing his projection for where crypto is probably headed (not good), and where it could realistically head should his viewpoint prevail (good).  As for why Gensler and the SEC shouldn’t be so alarmed, Owocki says crypto has the potential to solve exactly the problems that securities law was – in his view – made to address.  According to the Gitcoin co-founder, when stripped down to “first principles,” the SEC exists to solve the principal-agent problem.  Without getting too wonky, the principal-agent problem arises when the person at the top of a company, project or organization (the principal) delegates control to someone, such as an employee or customer (the agent). When the incentives between these two parties are misaligned – which Owokcki says happens when there are information asymmetries – you can run into trouble.  To illustrate where this can go wrong, Owocki gave the example of Sam Bankman-Fried. “FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried knew that he could make more money by giving funds to Alameda from customers,” Owocki explained. “If that material, nonpublic information had been distributed to retail, then he wouldn't have been able to do it.”  According to Owocki, blockchain-based tools like DAOs and transparent, on-chain finance can add a new level of transparency to organizations, thereby solving the principal-agent problem. (Had FTX been organized as a DAO, in other words, Owocki argues it wouldn’t have been able to become insolvent.)  As convinced as Owocki is by his crypto-as-a-commodity thesis, it’s difficult to imagine a software engineer’s arguments on securities law will hold water with regulators intent on taming a fraud-laden crypto industry.  Putting ideals into practice  Owocki – like crypto at large – acknowledges he still has much to prove when it comes to putting abstract ideals into practice.  A press release announcing his ​​supermodular project highlighted two major investments: buildbox and hypercerts – both aimed at raising money or building crypto infrastructure. Most of the highest-earning Gitcoin grantees have been crypto infrastructure projects.  Scaling blockchains and funding things that fund things is all well and good, but it is a bit hard to grasp how such applications will impact the world beyond blockchains.  Owocki and Gitcoin have funded more tangible projects in the past. They’ve helped drive experiments in Universal Basic Income (UBI), for instance.  But carbon credits – a use-case fraught with controversy – are the real-world application most associated with the budding regenerative finance, or “ReFi” movement.  The idea of commoditizing carbon and allowing companies to buy credits to “offset” their carbon footprint has, according to some activists and researchers, actually harmed the environment more than it’s helped over the years by allowing companies to engage in “greenwashing.”  Read more: Crypto Carbon: Can Blockchain Networks Fix Carbon Offsets?  Tokenized carbon credits were viewed in some crypto circles as a way to bring liquidity and transparency to an inefficient, shady carbon market. But early ReFi experiments with tokenized carbon credits, such as Klima DAO, have faced criticism for making some issues with the carbon credit system even worse. “There is baggage with that use case, and it does sink the movement,” Owocki concedes.  Owocki insists that the crypto-for-good movement – whatever its early flaws – is evolving in a positive direction.  “We’re not just starry-eyed, tie-dye, Grateful Dead optimists” argued Owocki. “I'm not a grad student that is in academia planning this – this is actually working out in the world.”  CORRECTION (Mar. 8, 17:44 UTC): Supermodular is not invested in the Gitcoin Grants Stack.

42415638,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5K1rX,1678276552,India's Crypto Businesses Handed Anti-Money Laundering Obligations for First Time,"India has added crypto to anti-money laundering rules, making crypto exchanges, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and custody service wallet providers legally responsible for monitoring suspicious financial activities.  The businesses will have to register with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) and comply with other mandatory processes under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the Ministry of Finance said Tuesday.  While India doesn't have a regulatory body dedicated to crypto, the move hands the FIU a significant role in overseeing crypto in the country. Until now, crypto businesses were not legally obligated to perform verification processes such as Know Your Customer (KYC). This has been written into the law and thus becomes mandatory.  They will also have to report suspicious activities to the FIU voluntarily and must designate a Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO) to ensure compliance with the act.  ""Crypto businesses would be required to have a customer due diligence and record management program in place and now they will have to mandatorily maintain transaction records related to crypto business,” said Shashi Jha, a partner at Jigsaw Law. “Earlier there was no avenue to submit suspicious transaction reports for these businesses. Now they can submit details of any suspicious activity to FIU-IND.”  As this year’s president of the Group of 20 industrialized nations, India has maintained that no regulatory framework is possible without global coordination. It recently steered the G-20 toward waiting for a global regulatory framework in the form of a synthesis paper jointly framed by the Financial Stability Board and the International Monetary Fund, expected by September or October.  ""Looks like VDA [virtual digital asset] services providers are now effectively categorized as 'reporting entities' under the PMLA,"" said Sumit Gupta, co-founder and CEO of crypto exchange CoinDCX. ""We have been voluntarily conducting these compliances for a while now, but happy to see that this has now been made into law.""  The Bharat Web3 Association had asked for the industry to be brought into the PMLA, Gupta said.  Indian authorities have already investigated several crypto exchanges as part of larger financial investigations under the PMLA.  Read More: India Has Clamped Down on Crypto.

Using the blockchain-based tokens that denote ownership of a digital asset for pure speculation doesn’t make it an investment instrument, but some NFTs in future could fall under financial regulations – for example, if a large set offer the same interest payments, the article by BaFin officials said.  “So far, BaFin is not aware of any NFTs classified as securities in the regulatory sense,” the article said. “However, it cannot be ruled out that NFT will be classified as a security in the future.”  Financial instruments would make linked services like investment advice or brokerage subject to regulatory scrutiny – but proof of ownership of collectibles or artwork are unlikely to count under money laundering laws, the article said. It added that regulators need to take account of the stability and integrity of the financial system.  How to treat NFTs has been a crucial issue for the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation, set to apply in Germany and across the European Union within a few years.

42415648,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5K2AZ,1678273846,Canadian Crypto Miner Pow.re Lands 100 MW Contract in Paraguay,"Canadian crypto miner Pow.re secured a contract for 100 megawatts (MW) of power in Paraguay, one of a handful that have been granted by the country's national utility (ANDE), according to a press release sent to CoinDesk on Wednesday.  The contract comes with a five-year fixed rate agreement, although Pow.re did not specify the price of the electricity. The company hadn't responded to a CoinDesk request for comment as of publication time.  Securing low-cost power is paramount to bitcoin miners because it is their largest operating expenditure.  Paraguay, in the center of South America, has abundant, cheap hydroelectricity from one of the largest dams in the world, Itaipu, which it shares with Brazil. However, as crypto miners have flocked to the country in search of cheap power, conflict with ANDE has been brewing. The utility claims the industry is taking advantage of the resource without greatly contributing to the local economy. Another key issue is the absence of infrastructure to make the electricity available for use.  ANDE has introduced new tariffs for miners, raising the price of energy.

42415637,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5K1mm,1678272826,Zero-Knowledge Technology Has Great Potential: FS Insight,"Zero-knowledge (ZK) technology has the potential to revolutionize a number of sectors by providing a safe and efficient way to verify information while maintaining privacy and security, FS Insight said in a report Tuesday.  The technology has a range of uses in areas including privacy, security, scalability, interoperability and sovereign identity, the report said. “ZK-tech has already seen product market fit in use cases such as privacy and authentication,” and it is expected that the ways in which the technology is implemented will increase over time.  Zero-knowledge proofs allow one party to prove to another that something is true without revealing any information.  “It is also a promising way to scale Ethereum to the masses” because it allows thousands of transactions to be bundled off-chain into one, giving greater efficiency, the note said, adding that protocols such as Polygon, Aztec and ZK-Sync have successfully implemented zero-knowledge technology. Zero-knowledge rollups are Ethereum layer 2 protocols that process transactions separately from the main blockchain to increase speed and lower fees.  FS Insight says ZK tech’s ability to make transactions on the blockchain anonymous may put it in the “crosshairs of regulators and law enforcement” looking to crack down on illegal activity such as money laundering. It notes that regulators have already targeted Tornado Cash, which uses ZK technology.  Regulators could continue to target ZK technology and may apply anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) measures to ensure that transactions are legal, the report added.

We are closely watching Ethereum’s Shanghai upgrade, an event that should occur in early spring, allowing staked ETH to be withdrawn. February was an excellent month for NFT sales as the number of buyers hit levels that haven’t been reached since June. Digital assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), outperformed equities and bonds in February despite regulatory actions in the US, with buyers in Asia and the Middle East continuing to invest. “When you look at the data, it’s interesting: The number of active addresses for Bitcoin has stayed relatively constant since really the Three Arrows Capital collapse, even through the FTX issue. That tells you that engagement overall has stayed fairly consistent in a period when a lot of leverage was taken out of the system.” John Deters, Chief Strategy Officer CBOE, Q4 earnings call Feb 3rd 2023 Digital assets outperformed equities and bonds in February despite a cascade of SEC & DOJ regulatory actions in the U.S. that failed to deter buyers in Asia and the Middle East. Meanwhile, a new Bitcoin narrative emerged as the “Ordinals” NFT project found a way to monetize under-utilized Bitcoin blockspace, leading to some meaningful pickup in block space demand and fees. For the month, the S&P 500 fell 2%, Nasdaq -1%, while BTC rose 1% and ETH +3%. Not only did Bitcoin outperform the Nasdaq again in February, but its 30-day annualized volatility fell again to 40% compared to the S&P energy sector at 45% and S&P tech at 40%. And while February’s month-end Bitcoin price was only up 1% from January’s, the average Bitcoin price was +15% m/m, providing meaningful relief to financially struggling Bitcoin miners. Indeed, several miners took advantage of more favorable capital markets to announce large mining capacity additions, including Hut Energy, which announced a merger with US Bitcoin Corp and Iris Energy ( IREN ) and CleanSpark ( CLSK ), who announced rig purchases. The Bitcoin network’s hash rate, a measure of all computing power working on Bitcoin, rose to another record high, up 9% from January. Given the restrictive environment that the current US administration has presented for banks, brokers, and other institutions in crypto, we are focused on ex-U.S. adoption to validate our fundamentally bullish view on open-source blockchain-based tokens as alternatives to U.S. dollar hegemony. And while we were disappointed that Nigeria’s relatively pro-Bitcoin opposition candidate failed to win in February’s presidential election (though Peter Obi did take the capital province of Lagos), we continued to note digital assets adoption in Asia and the Middle East in February: Russia’s largest bank Sberbank announced plans to launch an Ethereum-based DeFi platform; the UAE’s northernmost emirate Ras Al Khaimah announced plans for a “free zone” solely dedicated to non-regulated activities in the virtual assets sector; and the government of HK released a plan that would let retail investors trade digital tokens like Bitcoin and Ether on exchanges licensed by the Securities & Futures Exchange, with the implicit backing of the CCP according to the Bloomberg News piece “Hong Kong’s Crypto Hub Ambitions Win Beijing’s Quiet Backing.” TimeFrame Asset February 90 Day 365 days MarketVector™ Infrastructure Application Leaders 14% -31% -43% MarketVector™ Decentralized Finance Leaders 13% -46% -41% Coinbase 11% -39% -66% Ethereum 3% -26% -42% Bitcoin 1% -36% -44% MarketVector™ Centralized Exchanges -1% -5% -32% Nasdaq -1% 0% -17% MarketVector™ Smart Contract Leaders -2% -26% -64% S&P 500 -2% 3% -9% MarketVector™ Media & Entertainment Leaders -10% -22% -78% Source: Bloomberg, MarketVectors as of 2/28/2023.

Smart Contract Platforms Layer-1 Smart Contract platforms, in aggregate, underperformed Bitcoin and other sectors we track in the space, even as ETH, up 4%, continued January’s bullish tape. Ethereum’s daily issuance was deflationary throughout the entire month, driven by increased activity at the largest 15 dApps (decentralized applications), whose combined ETH fees rose 44% in February, leading to a bigger burn. Specifically, Uniswap ( UNI-USD ) fees more than doubled, surging from 6,461 ETH to 12,943 ETH, increasing Uniswap’s share of ETH fees from 23% to 33% of the top 15 dApps. OpenSea fees fell slightly in absolute terms, 6,192 ETH to 6,087 ETH, but lost significant relative share declining from 23% to 16%. Meanwhile, Blur, an NFT trading platform geared at active traders, conducted an airdrop and reward campaign; Blue’s fees tripled from 1460 ETH to 4698 ETH, and fee share increased from 5% to 12%. Ethereum Fees, Top 15 Smart Contracts Source: Dune as of 2/28/2023. (Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein.) Looking ahead, we are closely watching Ethereum ’s Shanghai upgrade, an event that should occur in early spring, allowing staked ETH to be withdrawn. Until this upgrade is released, neither ETH staked to validator nodes nor rewards for staked ETH can be withdrawn to be sold. There is a vigorous debate among many in the broader crypto community about whether the Shanghai upgrade will be bullish or bearish for the price of ETH. With nearly 14.7% of supply staked at an average price of $2,168, representing around 18.1M ETH worth $29.8B, enabling withdrawals could lead to significant sales given that many stakers are underwater since staking their ETH. Others contend that most stakers are committed long-term holders whose purchase prices are much lower than the price where they staked and that the supply that offramps may be counteracted by staking from parties who were previously concerned about the ability to withdraw. Recent action around deposits of ETH into the staking contract, reaching levels not witnessed since March 2022, suggests that many are becoming more comfortable staking ETH, which would counteract any selling pressure. Weekly ETH Staked Versus Total Staked ETH Source: Dune as of 2/27/2023. (Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein.) One notable event in February involved the ongoing legal dispute between Dapper Labs ( FLOW-USD ) , the entity behind the Flow Blockchain and NBA Top Shot , and a group of individuals who purchased Top Shot NFTs. The plaintiffs allege that Dapper Labs’ “NBA Top Shot Moments” are securities and that Dapper violated securities laws by failing to register Top Shots with the SEC. Dapper Labs filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in the Southern District of New York. Still, the judge overseeing the case denied the motion on February 22 because the plaintiffs’ case contained sufficient merit to bring to trial. The result will be that the trial participants will present evidence on whether or not Top Shots are securities by arguing the application of the Howey Test. While the decision from the trial’s outcome will be “narrow,” as cited by the presiding Judge Marrero, meaning that its findings cannot necessarily be applied to all other NFTs, the ruling will still likely inform other cases due to the preeminence of the Southern District of New York in determining securities law precedence. In his decision, the judge also cites the centralization of the Flow Blockchain, created by Dapper Labs, and the value interplay between Dapper offering Top Shots NFTs and Dapper benefitting from FLOW token price appreciation. Specifically, Judge Marrero contends: “It follows that, if hypothetically, Dapper Labs went out of business and shut down the Flow Blockchain, the value of all Moments would drop to zero… While the Howey analysis for Moments is separate from that pertaining to FLOW, the economic realities and technological interplay between FLOW, the Flow Blockchain, and Moments, as alleged by Plaintiffs, are what supports the Court’s conclusions.” Regardless of the case's outcome, allowing this case to come to trial raises the possibility of future action against Dapper Labs and, if precedent is established, other blockchains and developer teams. In response, Dapper Labs’ General Counsel Alex Levine appeared on a Bank of America client webinar in February to reiterate that Dapper disputes the ruling, that the FLOW blockchain was originally centralized with Dapper controlling more than 50% of the nodes, but has since decentralized sufficiently with smart contract deployment becoming permissionless and Dapper’s node control falling below 50%. Among specific layer 1 winners in February, notable performers included Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) , +12%, and Fantom ( FTM-USD ) , +5%. Polygon distinguished itself most notably through a surge in on-chain usage. In February, Polygon announced partnerships with the German financial entity DekaBank and Doritos while also committing to an official release date, March 27, for Polygon ZK Mainnet. Polygon saw a dramatic increase in block space demand, causing fees to increase by nearly 80% as DEX volume doubled and NFT volume quadrupled those of January. This surge in usership on Polygon was partly driven by the fruits of earlier major corporate partnerships as the prices of previously free Starbucks NFTs on Polygon were bid to $2,000. At the same time, over 1.3 million Reddit Superbowl NFTs were minted on Polygon. Meanwhile, Fantom’s fees increased nearly 3x amid the announcement of gasless transactions through application subsidies and the launch of new DeFi applications such as Equalizer and Mummy (continuing Fantom’s paranormal project name themes). Additionally, the current leader of Fantom, Andrew Cronje, boasts the runway for building FTM is now 45 years after savvy investments and cost-saving measures. The weakest performers in February were emerging alternate Layer-1s Aptos ( APT-USD ) , -30%, and Avalanche ( AVAX-USD ) , -12%. Aptos was a sensational outperformer in January, +492%, partly due to an astonishing short squeeze and strong growth of on-chain user metrics. However, in February, on-chain usership, such as daily active addresses, transactions, and DEX volumes, sagged. While Aptos offers the novel Move language as well as high transaction throughput through parallelized transactions, we are on the sidelines with Aptos until fundamental on-chain metrics improve. For example, TVL on Aptos is only $54M, and DEX daily volume is only $2.2M compared to Polygon’s $1.28B and $153M, and Ethereum’s $33.5B and $1.5B, respectively. Likewise, we would like to see a greater distribution of APT tokens as the current value of traded APT tokens is only 1/6 th of its fully diluted value – meaning that a great deal of supply exists to unlock and dilute existing holders. Finally, we are hesitant to commit capital to APT until more applications emerge on the Aptos blockchain that leverage Aptos’s Move language to provide unique applications that cannot be found on other chain. Daily DEX Volumes Source: Artemis.xyz as of 2/27/2023. (Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein.) Avalanche ’s AVAX token also had a mammoth January, +86%, on the back of partnership announcements with Amazon ( AMZN ) and Shopify ( SHOP ) and a rebound in C-Chain transactions and DEX volume. February saw a partial unwind of that exuberant price action despite positive news such as the release of important network tooling such as Avalanche HyperSDK, a partnership with Tencent to enable node deployments, and the official announcement of a subnet (a blockchain secured by Avalanche) by Indian gaming powerhouse Loco Legends. Avalanche price retracement also reflects flat usership by most metrics in February as the Avalanche ecosystem of applications saw few new compelling deployments. The Avalanche ecosystem also confronted the de-pegging of Platypus Finance’s stablecoin as well as drops in weekly active developers and weekly code commits. However, we remain bullish on AVAX because Avalanche has made great strides in technology and tooling that bring Avalanche closer to becoming the valuable epicenter of a multiverse of blockchains. Warp Messaging, released in December, gives Avalanche’s web of blockchains the ability to communicate and transfer assets securely. Likewise, HyperSDK gives developers the out-of-the-box tooling to create new blockchains while reducing building costs by thousands of hours of coding and millions of dollars in developer salaries. Likewise, we are encouraged by the potential of Avalanche’s gaming use case with subnets under development that will host studio-quality games from Shrapnel, Loco Legends, and Gunzilla. Additionally, we are encouraged by Avalanche President John Wu’s commitment to bringing real-world assets on chain, as expressed by Avalanche tokenizing a KKR Private Equity Fund and onboarding Intain Markets, who will host asset-backed securities on a purpose-built subnet. Metaverse & NFTs February was an excellent month for NFT sales as the number of buyers hit levels that haven’t been reached since June, and volume matched January’s despite February’s 3-day deficit. Trading activity was largely driven by a period of hyper-competition between Blur and OpenSea following the former’s token airdrop. For context, Blur launched their NFT marketplace last October with 0% trading fees and has consistently eaten away at OpenSea’s market share ever since. Fast-forward to February 14th, Blur launched their token and airdropped 12% of the supply to NFT traders who had used the platform based on the volume traded, and further announced that 10% of the BLUR token will be airdropped to future traders. Following the announcement of a future airdrop, NFT volume on Blur skyrocketed. In response, OpenSea reduced their fees to 0% for the most popular collections for an undefined period of time. OpenSea’s efforts to squelch Blur’s momentum, however, have initially proved futile as Blur commands a ~75% and growing share of Ethereum NFT trade volume, a stat that OpenSea held just last summer. The BLUR token has been very volatile since its launch with its price initially falling to below $0.50, rallying over $1.30, and eventually settling at its current price of $0.80 as of Feb 28th, representing a fully diluted value of $2.4 billion. OpenSea most recently raised at a $13.3 billion valuation in January of 2022 due to it dominating Ethereum NFT trading market share at the time. Since Blur now holds this title, we believe the market may be undervaluing the BLUR token. Monitoring how many tokens are sold when they unlock to investors will be a big indicator of investor sentiment in BLUR moving forward, and it will be heavily dependent on whether their market share of NFT volume increases or decreases between now and then. Historical NFT Sales & Buyers - All Chains Source: Cryptoslam! As of 2/27/2023. (Past performance is not indicative of future results. Not a recommendation to buy or sell any of the names mentioned herein.) Nevertheless, tokens in the MVIS Media & Entertainment (metaverse) category fell 10% in February and underperformed as the market cooled off from the January rally. Of the largest metaverse tokens, APE (APE-USD) faced the most selling pressure and fell 11%, while MANA (MANA-USD) lost 8% and SAND (SAND-USD) only dropped 4%. APE’s lackluster performance can partially be attributed to the blowback Yuga Labs received for their first Bored Ape community game, Dookey Dash , which was a remake of a 15-year-old game, Missile Game 3D, and quickly became mastered by bots. The Dookey Dash competition concluded mid-month with the golden key prize going to Faze Mongraal, a professional Fortnite streamer and, as the name implies, a member of the infamous Faze Clan esports team. Mongraal then listed the key on OpenSea for 2,222 ETH, with the highest offer coming in at 999 ETH. Other Sewer Pass holders recorded their Dookey Dash achievements in their Sewer Pass metadata, allowing them to “summon a power source” in the future based on their rank. February also welcomed the addition of a new chain enabling NFT creation: Bitcoin! The Bitcoin NFTs are known as Ordinal Inscriptions and are created by running a node and using an Ordinals wallet to inscribe the digital content data into the witness of the transaction. Not only does this development create more demand for Bitcoin blockspace, but it is also inspiring teams to build marketplaces and other infrastructure in anticipation of the expansion of Bitcoin use cases. Like every development in crypto, inscriptions have created a divide between network users. Some believe the new use cases will solve the security problem caused by declining network activity, while others subscribe to the belief that Bitcoin blockspace should only be used for BTC transactions and dislike the fact that more Ethereum-like trends continue to find their way to Bitcoin. Who is right? Only time will tell, but Dapper Labs’ decision at the end of the month to release TwelveFold, a 300-piece generative art collection using Ordinals, adds to the bullish narrative in our opinion.

Cryptocurrency is a digital representation of value that functions as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value, but it does not have legal tender status. Cryptocurrencies are sometimes exchanged for U.S. dollars or other currencies around the world, but they are not generally backed or supported by any government or central bank. Their value is completely derived by market forces of supply and demand, and they are more volatile than traditional currencies. The value of cryptocurrency may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency for cryptocurrency, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular cryptocurrency should the market for that cryptocurrency disappear. Cryptocurrencies are not covered by either FDIC or SIPC insurance. Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency. Investing in cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks. In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing. There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future. Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing. The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate. The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology. Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated. Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication and willingness to bear the risks of an investment and a potential total loss of their entire investment in cryptocurrency. An investment in cryptocurrency is not suitable or desirable for all investors. Cryptocurrency has limited operating history or performance. Fees and expenses associated with a cryptocurrency investment may be substantial. There may be risks posed by the lack of regulation for cryptocurrencies and any future regulatory developments could affect the viability and expansion of the use of cryptocurrencies. Investors should conduct extensive research before investing in cryptocurrencies. All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

42415643,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5K2FK,1678263903,Bitcoin Slips to 3-Week Low as Market Sees Federal Reserve Lifting Rates to 5.65%,"Bitcoin fell to a three-week low Wednesday as U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's hawkish testimony to Congress spurred traders to price in a higher ""terminal rate.""  The leading cryptocurrency by market value fell to $21,871 during Asian trading hours, a three-week low, CoinDesk data show. Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, nearly tested Tuesday's low of $1,535.  Powell on Tuesday said the central bank is likely to raise rates more than previously expected, warning that the process of pushing inflation down to the 2% target has a ""long way to go."" Since last year the Fed has raised rates by 450 basis points (bps), roiling risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  In response to Powell's hawkish comments, traders of the fed funds futures lifted their forecasts for the peak or terminal rate to 5.65% from around 5.47% early this week and 4.9% a month ago. In other words, traders now expect continued tightening over the coming months, with the central bank raising rates by at least 100 basis points before calling it a day.  A closer look at the fed funds futures reveals that traders have been pricing a ""higher for longer interest rates"" approach by the Fed. The fed funds futures are derivative contracts widely used by traders to express their view of where the official interest rate will be at the time of the expiration of the contract.  As seen in the feature image, currently, October futures represent the terminal rate, implying a peak borrowing cost of 5.65%. A month ago, June futures represented the peak rate of 4.9%.  ""You can see the peak in the curve is in the October contract now. Last week it was the September contract. It's a reflection of the higher for longer trend,"" Geo Chen, macro trader and author of the popular Substack-based newsletter, Fidenza Macro, told CoinDesk.  If that's not enough, the market now sees a 70% probability of the Fed raising rates by 50 basis points later this month, a reacceleration of tightening after a brief step down 25 bps in February. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to interest rate expectations, has crossed above 5% for the first time since 2007 and could rise further toward 5.655, considering the terminal rate pricing.  Rising rates/yields dent the appeal of risk assets and could make it difficult for bitcoin to sustain the current valuations, as QCP Capital noted. The Singapore-based trading firm said last month that bitcoin is yet to see the last leg of the bear market that could see prices revisit, if not break below the November low of $15,480  Some observers, however, don't see rising yields leading to a big sell-off in risk assets.  ""I don't see equities and crypto as being very vulnerable to a selloff anymore as there has been so much derisking and deleveraging already,"" Geo Chen, macro trader and author of the popular Substack-based newsletter, Fidenza Macro, told CoinDesk. ""My long-term bias is that risk assets will trend higher once we return back to a disinflation regime. However, this could take a few months.""  Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at Marex Solutions, voiced a similar opinion, saying most institutional speculators, who would want to short futures (take leveraged bearish bets) on the market amid rising yields, have been ""de-platformed.""  ""Even if their models are flashing short it!, there're fewer options to trade securely and with capital efficiency. FTX is gone. Binance is under siege. Coinbase is great for spot, but they don't offer derivatives. Not every fund can access the CME. Deribit is domiciled in Panama,"" Solot said in an email.  Solot added that short-term institutional investors appear to play a lesser role in price discovery while bullish investors operating only through crypto wallet Ledger, MetaMask or social media platform Twitter have more say in price determination.

A beta testnet is a blockchain that mimics real-world functioning. Layer 2 refers to a set of off-chain systems (separate blockchains) built on top of layer 1 protocols that reduce bottlenecks with scaling and data.  These bundle multiple off-chain transactions into a single layer 1 transaction, which helps reduce the data load and fees.  As CoinDesk previously reported, Shiba Inu developers said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications especially as the non-fungible token (NFT) sector is expected to heat up in the coming years, apart from Shibarium’s use as a cheap settlement for decentralized applications (dapps) built on the network.  The launch could contribute to strong fundamentals for shiba inu, formed in the previous bull market as a Shiba Inu-themed meme coin that has since tried to position itself as a serious project with its own blockchain network and dapp ecosystem.

42415645,VBhPuD9aGhKOgEJ3c5K2Tb,1678257657,"Curve Yield Farmers Rush to Deploy $60M on Newly Launched Conic Finance, Capture 21% APY on USD Coin","A new tool to capture yields from prominent stablecoin swapping service Curve has attracted over $60 million from depositors just over a week after launch.  Conic Finance, which went live on March 1, allows users to deposit tokens into its omnipools, a new product that diversifies exposure across the Curve ecosystem while increasing rewards.  Each omnipool allocates liquidity of a single asset into different Curve pools. All Curve liquidity provider (LP) tokens get staked on Convex to boost curve (CRV) rewards earnings. Convex (CNX), another Curve ecosystem token, is also rewarded, and so is conic (CNC), Conic’s native token.  Conic users can earn up to 21% annualized yields on the three omnipools for dai (DAI), frax (FRAX) and USD coin (USDC). The USDC pool has attracted over $50 million in liquidity alone, as Conic is currently providing one of the highest available yields in the crypto market for USDC. Deposits of frax and dai are considerably lower at $7 million and $5 million, respectively.  Holders can lock their CNC tokens for vlCNC to participate in Conic governance and directly control how liquidity is allocated across Curve pools by participating in Conic’s Liquidity Allocation Votes (LAV) – which determine the share of an omnipool’s liquidity that a Curve pool can receive.  In the coming weeks, Conic’s demand among traders for its yield-generating products could ultimately generate value for its own CNC token.  As such, CNC tokens currently trade at $8, losing 4% in the past 24 hours with a market capitalization of $32 million.  Why use Conic?  Curve uses smart contracts to offer an efficient way to exchange stablecoins while maintaining low fees and low slippage, according to developer documents. Depositors on Curve earn annual yields of up to 4% from one of the many pools on the platform, which locks over $5 billion worth of Ethereum-based tokens on its platform.  Curve tokens (CRV) are issued as yield farming rewards to liquidity providers on Curve Finance, and can be converted into vote-escrowed CRV (veCRV). Holding veCRV allows users to participate in platform governance, earn higher rewards and fees and receive airdrops.  The tokens are time-locked, meaning users are incentivized to lock their CRV for a long time to receive more veCRV and platform rewards. However, this mechanism effectively locks up liquidity, creating opportunity costs for users.  This is where protocols like Conic come into play, allowing users to gain exposure to, or provide liquidity to, the Curve ecosystem to get rewarded while not having to lock up their tokens for long time periods by depositing on Curve directly.",POSITIVE,CRV | USDC,CRV | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | USDC,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/03/08/curve-yield-farmers-rush-to-deploy-60m-on-newly-launched-conic-finance-capture-21-apy-on-usd-coin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2af86952c34058a7927055f67c2d82687bc5952d-5290x3194.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412729,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vOU,1678242080,Sotheby’s and UnicornDAO Host International Womens’ Day Art Auction,"Sotheby’s has teamed up with digital art collective UnicornDAO to curate a non-fungible token (NFT) auction in honor of International Women’s Day.  The “My Body, My Business” auction, which kicked off Tuesday, features works from 34 traditional artists including Marina Abramović, Cindy Sherman, Jenny Holzer and Ellen Von Unwerth. Additionally, the collection will include works from Web3-native artists including Olive Allen, Latashá, Jen Stark and Nadya Tolokonnikova, the collection’s curator and founding member of the activist group Pussy Riot.  Tolokonnikova, who co-founded UnicornDAO last year as a collective to empower women and LGBTQ+ NFT creators, is enthusiastic about utilizing art and activism to help empower women and underrepresented communities.  “Pussy Riot is meant to encourage people to be part of the movement, not just be bystanders who ‘appreciate’ and ‘support’ from the sidelines after the fact,” Tolokonnikova told CoinDesk. “We bring our fight to the streets, we bring our fight to the blockchain, to the galleries and auction houses and museums.”  The auction will be open until March 14. A portion of the proceeds will be donated to organizations like Planned Parenthood that support women’s reproductive health. Crypto donations platform Endaoment is launching PPFA.eth, a wallet address that will help direct further donations to the organization.  “Women have rights on her own body and I support every woman’s decision regarding planning parenthood,” said Abramović in a press release.  For the past two years, Tolokonnikova has been utilizing NFTs for activism and empowering underrepresented communities through her art. In January, she teamed up with fellow artistic activist Shepard Fairey to release a collection called Putin’s Ashes, to raise money for troops in Ukraine.

42412736,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vTA,1678238944,"First Mover Asia: Bitcoin, Ether Bounce Back After Being Tested by Fed Chair Powell’s Comments","Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: In prepared comments before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that inflation remained problematic. Bitcoin tumbled initially but later recovered.  Insights: CryptoRank data shows that despite their down 2022, many crypto funds have risen over the past three years.  Prices  Bitcoin, Ether Being Tested by Powell’s Comments  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,038 −6.1 ▼ 0.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $22,249 −240.8 ▼ 1.1% Ethereum (ETH) $1,568 −5.8 ▼ 0.4% S&P 500  3,986.37 −62.0 ▼ 1.5% Gold  $1,816 −32.0 ▼ 1.7% Nikkei 225  28,309.16 +71.4 ▲ 0.3% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Good morning Asia, here’s how the markets are performing today.  Bitcoin and ether began the morning in Asia in the green, but are back in the red, if ever so slightly, after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy is running hotter than expected and the central bank is “prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes” in the name of maintaining price stability.  The world’s largest digital asset is beginning the Asia trading day at $22,249, down 1.1% in the last hour while ether is trading at $1,568, down 0.4% in the last day.  “I think there will be an impact on anything that’s valued or traded against the U.S. dollar,” AdvisorShares CEO Noah Hamman said on a recent appearance of CoinDesk TV’s “All About Bitcoin.“ The secondary concern “is the reduction of the Fed’s balance sheet. This pulls a lot of liquidity out of the market and that’s more challenging for risky assets.”  Meanwhile, China token Conflux is up 9.1% during the last 24 hours. In the past week, the token is up 12.8%, outperforming other China narrative coins such as NEO and filecoin.  Ether continues to outperform bitcoin, if ever so slightly. Bitcoin is down around 1% during the last 48 hours, while ether is down 0.25%.  “There’s significant narrative and meaningful structural tailwinds behind Ethereum over the next 12-18 months with the Shanghai [upgrade] and a lot of staking becoming liquid,” Quinn Thompson, the head of capital markets at Maple Finance, told CoinDesk TV during a recent interview.  While Ethereum, and the mission-critical pieces of infrastructure might be having their moment, Thompson said some of the more “speculative” projects on the “longer tail of the spectrum” are going to struggle.  “That’s kind of the problem plaguing crypto right now. With on-chain activity lower, new addresses lower, there’s not really an uptick in activity that coincides with an uptick in revenue,” he said. “Most protocols and projects in the space are facing a little bit of a crunch on the budget side.”  All this is helping the consolidation narrative, he said, leading to majors like bitcoin and Ether outperforming.     Insights  Crypto Funds Are Dented but Hardly Broken After 2022 Free Fall  Crypto fund Multicoin Capital recently disclosed to investors that its hedge fund lost 91% of its value. Sino Global, once on top of the crypto world, found itself dragged into the black hole of FTX-Alameda because of close ties to Sam Bankman-Fried and his universe of tokens.  In any other industry, like traditional finance (TradFi) or tech, this would be the end of these funds. Losing almost the entirety of the fund would mean its moneymen, the limited partners (LP), would ensure everyone involved in executing the fund’s investment strategy is fired.  But this is crypto, and things work differently.  While there is still some rot within the crypto VC industry, and Galois Capital, which shut its doors in late February after losing $40 million to the collapse of FTX, won’t be the last fund to fail, many of these funds are enduring. And a number of them are even over a longer time horizon.  Data from CryptoRank, which tracks the fund's portfolios and known holdings, shows that while major funds like Delphi Digital, Polychain or Animoca are down 80%, 64% and 81%, respectively, over the course of the last 365 days, they are still well into the green during the last three years.  Many are also up over the last three months, thanks to the mini-bull market in January and early February.  Nature is healing. Bitcoin is trading above $20,283, its price on Nov. 2, the day FTX collapsed.. There are many tokens still in the red, but plenty that have posted incredible and somewhat unexpected gains in the last few weeks. Who saw the rise of the China tokens like conflux or filecoin?  But there are a few caveats.  CryptoRank can’t track the value of equity investments the firms would have made (though there are always more tokens than equity in their bag) nor can it track the preferential prices they might have secured for the tokens as an investor.  It also doesn’t know if funds have capital stuck on FTX – because courts won’t unseal a list of creditors. Token prices are liquid, and are bouncing back. But capital stuck on FTX will be an Achilles heel for funds, given that it might take a decade to recover.

42412723,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl5vH0,1678235391,CORRECTED: Louvre Museum Denies Reports of AI Artist Claire Silver’s Exhibition,"Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article cited reporting by Variety and statements from Claire Silver that the Louvre has since denied.  -Toby Bochan, Managing Editor, Web3  The Louvre Museum in Paris, France has denied that Claire Silver, a non-fungible token (NFT) artist that uses artificial intelligence (AI) in her work, will be exhibiting her latest collection there this month.  Variety first reported the news on Monday. ""Her work will be presented at legendary Paris museum The Louvre courtesy of Superchief Gallery NFT,"" beginning on March 21, it wrote. Superchief Gallery is a physical gallery space in New York and Los Angeles that exhibits NFTs.  Silver also touted on Twitter that her latest collection titled ""can i tell you a secret"" would premiere at The Louvre and that her one-of-one NFT artwork ""Love in the 4th Turning"" would be on exhibit there.  Silver tweeted on Tuesday that there was ""confusion"" with her announcement and that The Louvre had ""not acquisitioned my work."" ""I’m 'just' exhibiting there,"" she said, adding that it would be facilitated by Superchief gallery.  A spokesperson for The Louvre told CoinDesk that the information reported ""is not true.""  ""There is no exhibition of this artist at the Musée du Louvre,"" a spokesperson said.  Silver also said on Monday that she had signed for representation with global talent agency William Morris Endeavor (WME) as its first AI artist. ""We’ll bring AI art to mainstream culture together,"" she tweeted about the partnership. WME did not immediately respond to CoinDesk for comment.  Silver's ""Love in the 4th Turning"" is available on OpenSea, and at the time of writing, the top bid stands at 44.44 wrapped ether, or $62,605. The piece is currently owned by Superchief gallery.  Silver's announcement was met with skepticism online from members of the traditional art space.  Others suggested that the work would be exhibited at the Carrousel du Louvre, an underground shopping mall situated nearby the Louvre museum and the Place du Carrousel that regularly hosts art pop-ups.  Carrousel du Louvre did not immediately respond to CoinDesk to confirm.  Last month, pseudonymous NFT collector and influencer Cozomo de’ Medici donated several of his digital artworks to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), including artwork created by Silver.  Other museums, including Paris’ Centre Pompidou and the New York Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) have embraced NFT art in recent months.  Claire Silver and Superchief Gallery did not respond to CoinDesk for comment, though since the update to this piece, they have posted her version of events on Twitter.
