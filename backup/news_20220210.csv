13221043,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=483430,1644537583,"Crypto Market To Drop 80% Like Early Internet Company Stocks?, Why This Analyst Thinks So","The crypto market cap has recently begun to recover regaining $2 trillion. However, an analyst thinks a bear call could be in place given several similarities between the dot-com bubble in 2000 and the current crypto market. Related Reading | Crypto Market Cap Regained $2 Trillion With Bitcoin Reaching At $45K Crypto Mirrors The Internet. Good Or Bad News? Recent studies show that the adoption curve of cryptocurrencies is looking similar to the early adoption of the internet around 1993, which could point in at a hyper-inflection point to happen soon where crypto and its related technologies become a regular tool used in everyone&apos;s day-to-day lives. This could call for demand to increase and value to rise with it. However, an analyst predicts that similarities with the internet could turn into a repetition in history where the crypto market would drop around 80% as the Nasdaq did back in 2000 amidst the dotcom bubble, a result of speculative investments and an overabundance of capital markets funding dotcom startups that later failed to make a return. Investopedia explains that the dotcom bubble &apos;was a rapid rise in U.S. technology stock equity valuations fueled by investments in Internet-based companies in the late 1990s.&apos; The Nasdaq rose five-fold between 1995 and 2000, but then dropped reaching almost 77% in losses by Oct. 4, 2002. &apos;Even the share prices of blue-chip technology stocks like Cisco...",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-market-to-drop-80-like-early-internet-company-stocks-why-this-analyst-thinks-so/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

42375320,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7CHb,1644535666,First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Drops With Stocks After Fed Official's Hawkish Remarks,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Market moves: Bitcoin fell as U.S. stocks dipped further on hot inflation data.  Technician's take: BTC is approaching overbought levels, although pullbacks could stabilize at between $40K and $43K.  Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis.  Prices  Bitcoin (BTC): $43,807 -1.4%  Ether (ETH): $3,105 -4.1%  Top Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Ethereum Classic ETC +3.7% Smart Contract Platform Bitcoin BTC +2.4% Currency Bitcoin Cash BCH +2.0% Currency  Top Losers  Asset Ticker Returns Sector Internet Computer ICP −3.2% Computing Filecoin FIL −3.1% Computing Algorand ALGO −2.7% Smart Contract Platform  Markets  S&P 500: 4,504 -1.8%  DJIA: 35,421 -1.4%  Nasdaq: 14,185 -2.1%  Gold: $1,826 +1%  Market moves  Bitcoin (BTC) struggled to remain above $44,000 on Thursday, as U.S. stocks fell further following hawkish remarks by a Federal Reserve official.  Responding to a surprisingly high rate of inflation, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said he supported raising interest rates by a full percentage point by July, Bloomberg reported. His comments came after the U.S. Labor Department on Thursday reported that the consumer price index (CPI) for January hit 7.5%, which was higher than what analysts had expected.  Bitcoin started falling as stock prices declined further from an initial drop earlier in the day. At the time of publication, the oldest cryptocurrency was changing hands at $43,807, down 1.4% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  Meanwhile, ether, the second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was down over 4% to $3,105 in the same period.  “Things like gold and BTC often have a brief drop in hot CPI prints because the market starts quickly assuming faster rate hikes by the Fed,” Lyn Alden Schwartzer, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, explained in a tweet on Thursday.  Bitcoin's spot trading volume across centralized exchanges also rose on Thursday from a day ago. Trading volume in general was higher than a week ago, based on data compiled by CoinDesk.  Technician's take  Bitcoin Reverses Earlier Dip, Resistance Stands at $46K  Bitcoin has traded in a choppy range at between $43,249 and $45,843 over the past 24 hours.  Buyers reacted quickly to a nearly 5% price drop early in the New York trading session and maintained short-term support at above $43,000.  The next level of resistance is at $46,710, which represents a 38% retracement of the previous two month-long downtrend. Buyers could start to exit positions as BTC approaches resistance heading into the Asia trading session.  For now, momentum signals are improving on intraday charts, although price action is volatile following the U.S. inflation report. Stronger resistance is seen at $50,000 if buyers sustain short-term momentum.  Pullbacks could stabilize in the $40,000-$43,000 range.

Notably, Scott Conger, the mayor of Jackson, has been outspoken about his support for cryptocurrency and has pledged to create a system that would enable city employees to receive a portion of their paychecks in bitcoin.  Friendlier crypto laws will induce more companies to set up shop in Tennessee, something of interest to politicians on both sides of the aisle, Powell said.  “I’m optimistic because I think that my fellow lawmakers want to make sure that Tennessee stays ahead, and we’re doing everything we can to create a pro-business environment that’s going to foster companies wanting to be a part of our ecosystem,” Powell said about the bill's prospects, noting that he helped pass bipartisan blockchain-related legislation in 2018.  “It’s an issue that a lot of people - a lot of my colleagues - don’t understand,"" Powell said about crypto in general. ""But at the end of the day, it’s a conversation I’m going to continue. Hopefully we can get it passed, but if not, we’ll continue the conversation and continue to push legislation to promote blockchain technology in the state of Tennessee.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/10/bipartisan-bill-in-tennessee-would-allow-the-state-to-invest-in-crypto-and-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6c7e03e0da311754016594c9ae31335b5e13e19-2560x1842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375322,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7C2V,1644529117,"Meet Aarika Rhodes, the Pro-Bitcoin, Pro-Basic Income Congressional Candidate","Aarika Rhodes, a full-time elementary school teacher in Los Angeles County, has made bitcoin a central plank in her bid for Congress.  She’s running to outseat Republican Brad Sherman, a long-standing congressman who has been vocal about his disdain for cryptocurrency. For Rhodes, bitcoin is a tool to address economic inequality and improve financial access.  “If we’re going to solve poverty, we have to start being innovative around it,” she said in an interview on CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" on Wednesday. “And I think the Lighting Network offers that,” referring to the second-layer scaling tool for the Bitcoin network.  Although she is a long shot, Rhodes is part of a new class of politicians who are making crypto programs part of their mandate. They are enticed by crypto’s potential, the industry’s fervent “single-issue voters” looking to back any knowledgeable candidate and, yes, even the potential for crypto donations.  See also: Coinbase Files to Form a PAC Ahead of 2022 Midterms  It’s not Rhodes’ only unconventional economic idea. She told CoinDesk she also supports a universal basic income (UBI), or a government-run welfare program to give people small cash payments with no strings attached. In fact, for Rhodes, bitcoin and UBI go hand in hand.  For one, Bitcoin and UBI are both open systems – meaning that all would be free to access them. For a distributed network like Bitcoin, that means anyone can send payments or hold the digital asset, BTC. UBI, meanwhile, is designed as an alternative to traditional, means-tested welfare programs.  Some have argued that a “bitcoin standard” would rein in government spending, because there is a hard cap of 21 million BTC that will ever go into circulation. But Rhodes disagrees with the hypothetical idea that bitcoin would limit a government’s ability to spend.  ""I think the misconception of a universal basic income is that in order to have it, you have to print money,"" Rhodes said.  She’s hardly alone among bitcoiners. On Feb. 2, Rhodes co-hosted a Twitter spaces with a slew of participants, including Block CEO Jack Dorsey, who quit his job running Twitter to spend more time building Bitcoin use cases.  Rhodes said the two met prior to the event on Zoom, where they discussed poverty, including the controversy surrounding Bitcoin and UBI. Rhode’s campaign looks to find a way where the two can coexist.  Coming from her experience teaching in private and public schools, Rhodes feels the way government spending is executed is lackluster.  According to her, in order to address poverty in a meaningful way, reducing programs that aren’t working efficiently and allocating funds toward giving people a baseline income is the first step. In the same vein, Dorsey supports the UBI strategy, and has invested over $55 million in the U.S. and overseas via his Start Small initiative, a charity initially created for COVID-19 relief.  At the very least, be it bitcoin or UBI, digitizing money makes sense. According to Rhodes, 75% of people experiencing homelessness have a cellphone.  Though Rhodes says she is still learning about the crypto industry and her plan isn’t defined just yet, she sees bitcoin as a way to reach economic justice.  “My priorities are prioritizing our young people and modernizing our education systems and implementing financial literacy in schools,” Rhodes said.  Now, Rhodes is focused on winning the primary in order to have a debate with Sherman.  “I think what he’s done in Congress is not sufficient for being in there for 25 years,” she said. “You have a bunch of young freshmen and sophomore Congress members that are passing more legislation than these long-term incumbents. I think there’s a great appetite for change.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/02/10/meet-aarika-rhodes-the-pro-bitcoin-pro-basic-income-congressional-candidate,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e522b0489d89f4e3a1caa664b3bdae52475804fa-1426x842.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42375311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7C51,1644528899,FlamingoDAO’s NFT Portfolio Is Now Worth $1B,"One of the most exclusive decentralized autonomous organizations, FlamingoDAO, has shed light on the parabolic returns in the non-fungible token (NFT) space.  FlamingoDAO’s massive NFT portfolio, which boasts 215 CryptoPunks and 22 Bored Apes, is now worth an estimated $1 billion according to CoinDesk’s conversations with FlamingoDAO members and reporting from Forbes.  At inception in October 2020, Flamingo collected 60 ETH from each member (approximately $23,000 at the time).  Now, new members are buying in at 3,000 ETH or about $8 million. That’s a nearly 350-fold increase in dollar terms over 15 months.  Whale collective  FlamingoDAO aims to “give its Members the ability to develop and deploy NFT-focused investment strategies,” according to its site.  The DAO has so far amassed 7,920 ETH to date in its treasury, using the capital to purchase some of the rarest and most valuable NFTs.  In addition to CryptoPunks and Bored Apes, popular profile picture projects, the DAO owns 246 Chromie Squiggles, 371 Cryptoblots, five Autoglyphs and several other bespoke NFTs, known as 1/1s (“one of ones”). These NFTs can be cross-checked using blockchain data that traces back to FlamingoDAO wallet addresses. In total, the collection includes NFTs numbering into the thousands.  Aaron Wright, a FlamingoDAO founding member and founder of DAO tooling company Tribute Labs, told CoinDesk that Flamingo’s members are primarily crypto-native individuals who have been in the space for a long time.  Members frequently signal their membership via a flamingo emoji on their Twitter profile or a mention of @FlamingoDAO in their bio; they include crypto-industry heavyweights such as Aave founder Stani Kulechov and Artblocks founder Erick “Snowfro” Calderon, among others.  “First, membership was first come, first served,” Wright told CoinDesk. Now, prospective members have to get invited in by an existing member or gain entry through involvement with one of Flamingo’s sister DAOs, which includes The LAO, the DeFi-focused NeptuneDAO, music-focused NoiseDAO or metaverse-focused NeonDAO.  “The whales are all together,” said Wright, who describes Flamingo’s members as a mix of traders, developers, artists and builders. “That’s what makes these things so powerful. They’re horizontally organized.”  At any one time, membership is capped at 100 members, according to the FlamingoDAO site.  As Flamingo’s success sends its buy-in price skyrocketing, membership has increasingly attracted the attention of investment funds, said Wright.  NFT boom  As NFTs have seen soaring adoption among major consumer brands, Wright said he could see a future where NFTs make up the majority of crypto.  “I think a lot of people on Twitter are DeFi-focused, but I see it becoming a smaller part of crypto. Other segments are growing faster,” said Wright.  Even as crypto markets shed nearly half of their total market capitalization in a January sell-off, NFT marketplace OpenSea notched nearly $5 billion in sales volume that same month, an all-time high, according to data from Dune Analytics.  Derek Schloss, who heads crypto venture firm Collab+Currency’s NFT investments and is another co-founder of FlamingoDAO, is similarly bullish on the future of NFTs.  “NFTs are going to wrap all scarce non-fungible goods,” Schloss told CoinDesk. “Every major brand is thinking about NFTs and their Web 3 strategy.”",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Tracy Wang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/flamingodaos-nft-portfolio-is-now-worth-1b,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d57958443975e8d84e1249565e746623ac2393e9-612x380.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The increase in inflation was the fastest since February 1982 and exceeded economists' predictions of a 7.3% rise. The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates next month, which could ease inflation over time. Tighter monetary policy could also weigh on speculative markets such as equities and cryptocurrencies.  Stocks also fell on Thursday, with the S&P 500 down as much as 2% over the past 24 hours, while Treasury yields rose above 2%.  In crypto markets, bitcoin outperformed most alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins). Typically, during down markets, investors overweight bitcoin because of its lower risk profile relative to altcoins. BTC was roughly flat over the past 24 hours, versus a 4% drop in ETH and a 6% drop in SOL.  Latest prices  ●Bitcoin (BTC): $44122, −1.25%    ●Ether (ETH): $3114, −4.36%    ●S&P 500 daily close: $4504, −1.81%    ●Gold: $1828 per troy ounce, −0.40%    ●Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 2.03%     Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

42394290,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbPnr,1644523002,The Hard Truth About Being an 'Anon',"Here’s one take on formerly anonymous figures in the crypto world being publicly revealed: The two founders of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) weren’t “doxed” by BuzzFeed News. In fact, they doxed themselves.  Last week, the crypto community was embroiled in a debate about journalistic ethics and the right to remain anonymous online. This came after BuzzFeed News senior technology reporter Katie Notopoulos published the real names, along with some publicly available information, of “Gordon Goner” and “Gargamel,” two pseudonymous co-founders of arguably the most successful NFT (non-fungible token) project to date.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Notopoulos reportedly first identified Greg Solano through publicly available documents related to Yuga Labs, the company behind BAYC, which is incorporated in Delaware. Solano has chosen the name “Gargamel.” Additional documents linked Solano to Wylie Aronow, aka “Gordon Goner.”  You can decide for yourself whether this is newsworthy information. Notopoulos reasoned that the public has the right to know the real men behind this cultural storm. BAYC has licensing deals, and it has a lot of rich and powerful members as well as a reported cash injection on the way from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, according to Axios, valuing the firm at $5 billion.  The project may have a high valuation, but it’s also just a social club built around crudely drawn cartoon apes. It’s a side project of two unassuming writers that went faster and further than anyone expected it to. There’s a good conversation to be had around doxing, especially in this instance.  Yet, as it stands, Solano doxed himself. He signed a document that was then made publicly available. He signed that document because he wanted to legitimize Yuga Lab’s operations – and to do that, there are certain prerequisites in U.S. law.  Solano and Aronow could have chosen to keep BAYC as a widely successful NFT experiment and their identities secure. But they signed incorporation documents because there was a fortune to be made. It was in that moment of choice that the BAYC founders doxed themselves, forfeiting their right to privacy and secrecy.  Now listen ye anons, I believe – along with my employer, which has a policy of respecting sources’ pseudonyms – that your identities are valid. That there is a general right to remain unknown, that pseudonymous celebrities may be trustworthy (within reason) based solely on the reputations they build. But if you must remain unknown, then you must also do everything you can to ensure that. No one is assisting you here.  See also: Why CoinDesk Respects Pseudonymity  Crypto is an adversarial environment. Reporters are paid to bring private details to light. Competitors want your business secrets. The public has an unquenchable thirst for gossip. Scammers want to scam you, and knowing your secrets is leverage.  0xngmi, the pseudonymous founder of DefiLlama, a data aggregator, grasps this. Last weekend, in the midst of public debate about doxing, he put out a “bug bounty” on himself. (Though I'm using gendered language as convention, I do not know 0xngmi's gender.) “If anyone DMs me with my real identity along with an explanation of how you found it I'll send you 1 ETH,” he tweeted.  The goal was clear: to wrap up any loose ends related to his alter ego. DefiLlama has surged in popularity, and it’s likely 0xngmi’s reputation will become more valuable alongside it.  “The main reason for it was that I saw how BAYC founders got doxxed through company incorporation records,” 0xngmi told CoinDesk in a direct message. The simple fact is, no matter how careful you think you are, you have likely made mistakes. So often in life we find that other people know us better than we know ourselves.  0xngmi said that 178 people took up his offer, claiming they found his identity. Most made erroneous assumptions – the closest someone got was “an approximation of my time zone,” he claims. Someone else managed to dox another team member of DefiLlama and received the ETH bounty.  0xngmi has since closed the effort, because people started “spamming” his friends looking for useful information, which he said “bothers people.” An important aspect of ""OPSEC,"" or operational security, is knowing where other people look. And even if there is no guarantee 0xngmi’s identity is secure, it might bring a little peace of mind having 178 examples of how people think.  This is a problem 0xngmi has been considering for a long time. Last summer, he led an open-source effort to write “​​a guide on how to stay anon.” It’s a detailed document based on a lot of “trial and error,” he said.  Interestingly, the first step is to think about the “online persona you’d want to be perceived, remembered and recognized] by,” he said. His own fake name is a combination of 0x, which is the address prefix used by many other anons, and ngmi, which stands for not going to make it. It’s “self-deprecating.”  Obviously, 0xngmi has a desire to fit in – perhaps to blend in. It’s easy to spin up an alter ego, harder to sustain it and even harder to build trust as an “anon.” And if you want to have true influence, it’ll be a difficult choice between protecting your identity and leveraging your real-life connections – even in crypto where the practice is normalized.  See also: Many Bitcoin Developers Are Choosing to Use Pseudonyms  “For me going anon meant a reset to 0. I had been building in crypto for some time, and when I went anon, that meant I had to start from zero, losing all the work I had put into my reputation, relationships, past work and studies,” 0xngmi said. “People will trust you less, since the cost of doing something bad is lower for anons and we might be hiding something (eg: ex-convicts or ex-scammers),” he added.  Difficult though it may be, 0xngmi suggested there is something of an ethical imperative to going dark. It ties into crypto’s resistance to standards and practices like know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations, which require users to identify themselves to perform basic financial tasks that would be wholly legal if they were using physical cash.  “Blockchains flip that [model] on its head. You have your money, and you can use it any way you want, whether that be by putting it on straight-up Ponzis, buying worthless coins or farming on some protocol with an anon founder that could rug the whole thing,” 0xngmi wrote in a blog reflecting on BAYC.  To some extent, crypto is playing by a new set of rules. It stands opposed to corporate and government power in trying to give people the ability to interact directly in a peer-to-peer fashion. It’s sold out a bit – giving an inch here and there for profits. It’s surrounded by rule-makers. It’s been forced to capitulate, sometimes.  Not everyone is playing by crypto’s rules. Why would you expect otherwise? If you want to be anonymous, then you must cover your tracks. Rules were meant to be broken, after all.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | ZRX,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/02/10/the-hard-truth-about-being-an-anon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bff2273159e765be373c5d6a3514a1bc2dea25f4-2400x1886.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42375321,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWw7CIr,1644522819,Axie Infinity’s SLP Rallies 40% in 24 Hours After Season 20 Update,"The play-to-earn game Axie Infinity’s reward token SLP – short for smooth love potion – has surged by 40% over the last 24 hours after the launch of the ""Season 20"" update.  The update reduces the pace of issuance of SLP, cutting the daily new supply to 45 million per day, according to Axie Infinity.  The move followed recent complaints about the token's rapidly inflating supply and a 99% plunge in the price over a seven-month period.  The game has been affected by the hyperinflation of SLP, a result of a high SLP minting rate and low burning rate, according to a newsletter from Delphi Digital. This resulted in immense selling pressure on the token, with prices dropping below $0.01.  “The SLP rally is a direct response to the reduction of SLP issuance in the game,” said Aleksander Larsen, Axie Infinity’s co-founder, in an email to CoinDesk.  “Most seems to be driven by speculation, but we expect SLP to stabilize in the coming weeks as the fundamentals come into play,” added Larsen.  Although SLP has quadrupled in price over the last seven days in anticipation of the launch of Season 20, the token is still down from its all-time high of $2.41 reached in July according to data from Messari. This was amid a wave of headlines trumpeting the future of cryptocurrency-powered video games.  Axie Infinity wrote in a blog post that as a measure to stabilize the in-game economy it has removed all SLP rewards from ""adventure mode"" and will cap SLP rewards to increase token scarcity.  “Adventure mode was originally conceived as a way for the community to learn how to use their Axies,"" according to the blog post. ""It has outlived its purpose as a way for people to earn tokens from the game.”  The Season 20 update has also created a $7 million prize pool to “supercharge the competitive Axie scene,” according to the blog post.  AXS, Axie’s governance token, is up 40% in the last seven days and is trading at around $67 at press time.",POSITIVE,AXS,AXS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Lyllah Ledesma,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/10/axie-infinitys-slp-rallies-40-in-24-hours-after-season-20-update,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0cb5fd7843df6068ca6e6e8de708e67a88d32f60-8164x6123.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The capital will be used for product development and hiring aggressively in the coming months.  As part of the investment, a16z General Partner Angela Strange will join the Sardine board of directors.  San Francisco-based Sardine uses artificial intelligence to provide a real-time fraud score based on a user’s identity, device and behavior patterns at the time of account origination and account funding. The platform checks for fraud during each login, deposit and withdrawal.  The Sardine platform has now added instant bank Automated Clearing House (ACH) transfers for crypto on-ramps, removing the traditional three to seven-day waiting period for consumers to gain access to their funds. Sardine assumes the fraud, regulatory compliance and legal risks of the ACH transactions.  Sardine launched last spring and has since grown to over 50 customers, including neobank Brex, crypto exchanges FTX and Bakkt and crypto platforms MoonPay and Candy Digital.  Sardine CEO Soups Ranjan previously ran data science and risk at Coinbase. The Sardine team also includes veterans of Google Pay, Revolut, Bolt and PayPal.  “Every company with a payments component faces the same problem: the momentum-killing wait time between when the customer transfers money to your platform and when they can actually use that money on your service to transact,” said a16z’s Strange in the press release. “Sardine solves this issue in order to keep financial transactions moving for the good of all.

The stock was recently up nearly 15%, far outpacing today’s gains for the rest of the crypto mining industry.  CleanSpark CEO Zach Bradford announced the company's new strategy along with the release of its fiscal first-quarter earnings report late Wednesday.  BTIG analyst Gregory Lewis says the plan has the “potential to flip the script and drive incremental growth.”  The company has a current hashrate of 2.1 exahashes per second and another roughly 1.9 EH/s on order, Lewis wrote, with a hoped-for year-end hashrate of about 4.0 EH/s. He figures CleanSpark will need about $40 million in capital expenditures to hit that number.  Speaking on its earnings call, CleanSpark management said that it prefers to raise the capital by issuing rig-backed debt and that the company is in active talks with lenders. Other options include monetizing some of the company's bitcoin (BTC) holdings, which doesn’t necessarily mean just sales, because it might include yield strategies, as well.  BTIG’s Lewis maintained his buy rating and 12-month price target of $30 on CleanSpark's shares, which is triple the current levels.

As investors analyzed new US inflation data, which came in at 7.5% year-over-year vs an expected 7.3%, the earlier decline took shape.

The U.S. led in absolute numbers of deals, with 51% of all transactions last year, up from 41% in 2020. Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) garnered 33% of all deals, with Asia Pacific (APAC) netting 16%. Looking at deal dollar values, EMEA led the way at $25.5 billion versus $24.5 billion for the U.S. and $5 billion for APAC. Behind the rise in average deal size to $179.7 million from $52.7 million was 2021’s U.S.-centered special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) boom, which featured a number of $1 billion+ mergers.  PwC also tracked crypto fundraising deals, finding a 645% year-over-year rise in 2021 to a total value of $34.3 billion. The average deal size was up 143% to $26.3 million.  The diversified number of deals across business sectors shows the “continuing maturity of the crypto ecosystem,” said PwC, and signals wider adoption of crypto services.  Taking a peek into what might happen in 2022, the report authors expect continued momentum, noting a big rise in venture capital funds and dry powder needing to be put to work. With the slowdown in SPAC action, it will be venture capital firms and incubators as the largest source of M&A activity in crypto.

The terms DeFi, GameFi, and NFT, have been all over the media lately, and any of these would not be possible without smart contracts. As more smart contract platforms are introduced, it becomes hard for newcomers to choose which is right for them. This article will examine some of the most popular smart contract platforms and share our hands-on experience with them. Ethereum Token: ETH TPS: 10 Ethereum is the world&apos;s first smart contract platform. Developers create decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) with an object-oriented programming language called solidity. Users can interact with dApps that operate autonomously. Since Ethereum is the first smart-contract-enabled blockchain platform, it has a lot of active developers and has the most Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi as far as blockchains are concerned. However, despite being the most popular smart contract platform, it still has a few downsides that make us try to stay away from it when possible. One drawback is the slow transaction speed since Ethereum can only process around 10 transactions per second (TPS). The other problem is the hefty transaction fee it charges when the network is busy, in which the fee may sometimes cost more than the transaction per se.

In January, the IMF urged El Salvador&apos;s government to remove BTC&apos;s status as legal tender. Fitch also cited a &apos;high degree of uncertainty&apos; for external financing options surrounding the capacity to issue bitcoin (BTC-USD) backed bonds through new distribution channels. Recall at the beginning of January when El Salvador prepared 20 bills to provide a legal foundation for issuing bitcoin bonds.

42421851,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXwSUf,1644509460,Rarible NFT Marketplace: How to Get Started,"The surge in popularity in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) has turned a once-obscure art form into an overnight sensation. Ranging from Bored Apes to pixelated CryptoPunks and everything in between, there’s no shortage of NFTs to add to a collection – or places to purchase them.  Rarible is one of many digital art galleries and marketplaces where NFT owners can show off collections and offer them for sale. What makes this market different is the ability for any member to create their own NFT on one of several blockchains: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Tezos and Flow.  On October 20, 2022, the platform announced major updates, including that it is transitioning into an aggregated NFT marketplace, pulling Ethereum NFT listings from competitors like OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2 and Sudoswap. It also updated its platform fee structure: Rarible takes 1% on the buyer side and 1% on the seller side from every sale on the marketplace. For aggregated listings from other marketplaces, there are no Rarible fees. Listings aggregated from non-Rarible marketplaces are subject to their original marketplace fees.  What is the Rarible NFT marketplace?  The Rarible NFT marketplace was founded in 2019 by entrepreneur Alexei Falin, product manager Alexander Salnikov and product designer Ilya Komolkin. Based in Los Angeles, the company serves 1.6 million users with a trading value of $274 million.  One reason that Rarible stands out is the partnerships it has cultivated with major companies and famous celebrities. Social media site Twitter, fast-food operator Yum! Brands, boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and actress Lindsay Lohan all launched their NFTs with the help of Rarible.  You don’t have to be a celebrity to create an NFT project with Rarible. Because it offers access to several different blockchains, anyone with a vision and artistic ability can “mint” their NFTs and make them available to collectors.  Read more: Minting Your First NFT: A Beginner’s Guide to Creating NFTs  What do I need to get started on Rarible?  Getting started on Rarible is a simple and straightforward process. All you need to create an account is a cryptocurrency wallet for your blockchain of choice  To create an account to buy and trade NFTs, you will need a wallet that supports one of the several blockchains Rarible operates on: Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Tezos and Flow. While MetaMask is arguably the most popular wallet among NFT collectors, there are multiple wallet options across Ethereum, Solana, Tezos, Immutable X and Polygon.  From there, new users will have to agree to the terms and conditions and confirm they are over 13 years old. After a few moments, you will be ready to create, buy and sell NFTs through Rarible.  Read more: How to Create, Buy and Sell NFTs  Buying and trading NFTs on Rarible  Because Rarible supports transactions on different blockchains, there are multiple ways to buy and sell NFTs. It all depends on where the token was minted and the price. There are two ways to buy an NFT on Rarible: buying at a fixed price or through an auction.  Fixed price: The seller will list the NFT for sale at a set cost for a buyer. If you wish to purchase it, press the “Buy For” button on the NFT and complete the transaction.  Auction: With an auction, an NFT will be placed for sale for a certain amount of time, where multiple people can submit bids. The highest bid at the end of the auction will win the right to purchase the NFT at the highest price bid. At this time, auctions are processed only in cryptocurrency, and so be prepared to buy enough coins to cover your maximum bid. Also, be mindful that any crypto transaction is usually taxable.  Each blockchain supported by Rarible has different ways you can buy NFTs. For instance: The CryptoEggs “Civilizations” collection is minted on the Ethereum blockchain featuring a collection of animated NFTs. To purchase the NFT and add it to your connected wallet, click the “Buy For” button. A Checkout window will pop up, showing you the price after any fees. If you have insufficient funds in your wallet, you can also buy using a Visa or Mastercard.  Not all wallets and blockchains, however, allow you to purchase NFTs using a credit or debit card. As an example: The Ottez NFT collection is minted on the Tezos blockchain. When you select “Buy Now,” you will need to hold enough Tezos coins to complete the transaction. With Tezos NFTs, you can’t directly buy them using a Visa or Mastercard – but you can add funds directly to your wallet using the cards within Rarible.  Once you own one or several NFTs, you will be able to list them on your profile for display and sale. Because NFTs are stored in your linked crypto wallet, you can select which ones to display under your profile on the site and list your price. If someone decides to purchase your NFT, Rarible will handle the secure transaction, ensuring the NFT moves to the buyer’s wallet and depositing currency into yours.  Creating your own NFTs on Rarible  Rarible also allows creators to jump directly into the world of digital art by creating – or “minting” – their own NFTs. The process is rather simple: To get started, click the “Create” button at the top of the page.  Your first decision will be which blockchain you want to mint on. Each one comes with its own set of fees and other pros and cons, and so be sure to do your research ahead of time. Next, you will be asked if you want to mint a single, one-of-a-kind NFT or mint multiple NFTs of the same work. Acceptable file types include PNG, GIF, WEBP and MP4. Any pirated NFTs or art that violates copyright laws will be immediately removed from the platform.  The next steps are the fine details of the work: the title, description and type of sale for the NFT. You will also set your royalty price, which is the amount you will receive every time someone resells your art. To make your NFT collection more compelling, you can also add unlockable content for the buyer, including secret links or additional downloadable content.  Finally, you will have the option to pay the gas fees associated with minting your NFT or minting it for free. If you decide to go with the free option, you will pass the gas fees forward to the first buyer, increasing the price and potentially discouraging their participation in your project.  Read more: What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?  Bottom line: Is Rarible the right marketplace for me?  Rarible offers a unique platform for both collectors and creators to create digital art. Because it supports several different blockchains, this marketplace offers new users an opportunity to get into the sector without spending a lot on cryptocurrency or transferring tokens from one wallet to another.  Before jumping into Rarible, though, you should conduct your own research and due diligence on any NFT you are interested in buying. Like with any investment, there’s no guarantee any NFT will increase in value over time, and it could even lose value. By clearly understanding the risks and rewards, you can make the best decisions for your journey into cryptocurrency.

13221053,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=483369,1644508894,Where Do NFTs Get Their Value From?,"In an attempt to define NFTs briefly, one could describe how most cryptocurrency tokens are fungible (exchangeable with another token identical to it) while NFTs are the opposite (one-of-a-kind tokens). Since so much more can actually go into an NFT, they can be quite difficult to describe in a succinct manner. You may have heard definitions like &apos;it&apos;s digital art stored on the blockchain&apos;, or the disapproving generalization that NFTs are merely &apos;overpriced JPEGs&apos;. While such statements are polarising and debatable, this is not the full picture of what NFTs have to offer. So what is the true value of an NFT? NFTs Make Asset Authentication Simple Because NFTs are stored on the blockchain, their existence is permanently registered on a trusted network. Every transaction involving the transfer of an NFT from wallet to wallet since its creation is also permanently recorded. This provides an innovative, solid record of authentication. How is this useful in reality? Consider what recently happened to YouTuber, NFT and Pokémon card collector Logan Paul. He paid $3.5 million on what he thought was a &apos;sealed &amp; authenticated box of 1st Edition Pokémon cards&apos;, only to find that was not the case. Interestingly, the box had been validated as authentic by the Baseball Card Exchange.

42396063,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0dkb,1644505547,Ransomware Payments Are Getting Bigger as Hackers Shift Focus to Larger Targets: Chainalysis,"The average size of ransomware payments hit an all-time high in 2021, according to a new report by blockchain research firm Chainalysis.  Chainalysis’ data shows the average ransomware payment size last year reached $118,000 in cryptocurrency, up from $88,000 in 2020, according to a report published Thursday. In 2019, the average ransomware payment was only $25,000. Kim Grauer, Chainalysis’ head of research, attributes this jump to the growing sophistication of ransomware groups.  Over the last two years, ransomware attacks have skyrocketed. Chainalysis has identified $692 million worth of payments to wallet addresses affiliated with ransomware groups in 2020 and, at the time of publication, $602 million in 2021. However, Grauer stressed that the real number is likely to be much higher – setting a new record for ransomware payments in 2021 – as Chainalysis continues to identify ransomware-associated wallets.  As ransomware gangs continue to profit and gain experience, they are learning how to adapt to avoid detection and go after bigger targets. Grauer told CoinDesk that data shows many ransomware gangs are reinvesting a larger percentage of stolen funds back into their operations. In 2021,16% of all funds sent from wallets associated with ransomware operators were spent on tools and services, like penetration testing or more secure web hosting, to make their attacks more effective.  “They're investing in their business,” Grauer said. “You know, you have to spend money to make money.”  The jump, up from 4% in 2020, is largely driven by the rise of ransomware as a service (RaaS), which enables ransomware gangs to purchase already-developed strains of ransomware, like Conti or DarkSide, from ransomware creators, usually in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.  However, Grauer also pointed out that, while RaaS might be growing, blockchain data shows that at least 140 ransomware developers received payments from victims last year – a new all-time high. The growth signals that ransomware strains are becoming dormant faster, which Grauer said is a tactic used to avoid law enforcement detection, but is also a sign of the rise of home-brewed ransomware tools.  “We’re actually starting to see some places where there’s a move away from RaaS and back to self-produced ransomware,” Grauer said. “We’re seeing that in Iran, where Iranian bad actors are just building their own ransomware from scratch.”  Grauer told CoinDesk that, by creating their own ransomware, ransomware gangs can create a more tailored attack for specific or high-security targets.  “One thing we did see in Iran was some geopolitical attacks against targets in Israel,” Grauer said.  The geopolitical implications of ransomware are growing. After a Russia-based ransomware group carried out the Colonial Pipeline attack last summer, the Biden administration has made cracking down on ransomware a priority.  President Biden has called out Chinese state actors for ransomware and cryptojacking attacks, and pushed Russia to arrest known members of ransomware gangs. The administration also began adding crypto exchanges to its sanctions blacklist last year.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/02/10/ransomware-payments-are-getting-bigger-as-hackers-shift-focus-to-larger-targets-chainalysis,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e58fd268dc8245c11e98f1a1c62463f5f87adf3e-8256x5504.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Read more: Your First Crypto Wallet: How to Use It and Why You Need One  Least Authority has published a blog post to alert Atomic Wallet users to the potential risks associated with the vulnerabilities they claim to have discovered in the wallet's system design.  ""... we strongly recommend that the Atomic Wallet team immediately notify users of the existing security vulnerabilities. In addition, until the issues and suggestions outlined in the report have been sufficiently remediated and the Atomic Wallet has undergone subsequent security audits, we strongly recommend against the Atomic Wallet’s deployment and use.""  CoinDesk reached out to Atomic Wallet for comment but did not receive a reply at time of initial publication. Atomic's CEO Konstantin Gladych has since responded with the following statement:  We have taken all the issues discovered by Least Authority into full account.  For some issues, we have already released corresponding patches and notified Least about doing so.  To implement the remaining suggestions, we will need to rework some parts of our application’s core architecture. This will take some more time as per our estimate, but we are working on it. None of those issues pose any security risks to our users, as Atomic is a non-custodial wallet and all data is stored locally on users’ devices. We are expecting to implement the rest of Least’s suggestions in Q2 2022. Once we are done, we will re-audit the application.  Atomic Wallet has undergone two security audits so far. The other audit, conducted by DerSecur Ltd, asserted: “The application’s average security score is 4.7. This result is higher than the market average. The application can be considered secure enough, nevertheless, we recommend bringing to the attention vulnerabilities discovered during the audit and consulting with the detailed results.”  Security is our highest priority, and we are continuously working on improving Atomic Wallet. Therefore, we have thoroughly reviewed Least’s report and will be done implementing their recommendations in full in Q2, 2022.  Responsible disclosure  Least Authority was first hired to examine Atomic's system design as well as its corresponding core, desktop and mobile coded implementations in early 2021. That report, delivered to Atomic in April, concluded that there were vulnerabilities and insufficiencies that put users at ""significant risk.""  The research team stated that the wallet sent them a response noting their updates and improvements in November. However, after checking Atomic's remediation commits, Least Authority discovered that ""a significant number of issues and suggestions remain unresolved ...""  Further attempts to work with Atomic to resolve the outstanding security issues have been unsuccessful, according to Least Authority.  Now, after 10 months of following responsible disclosure procedures, Least Authority is taking the next step in alerting Atomic's users to the potential risks associated with the vulnerabilities they claim to have discovered. In the interest of preventing malicious actors from acting on the information in the final report, the security team is not releasing the finer details of their findings.  ""We hope that this disclosure of the existence of significant vulnerabilities without providing details helps to appropriately warn users without putting them at even greater risk,"" the blog post states.  Today marks the first time since its establishment in 2011 that Least Authority has taken this step to alert the public to unresolved security issues with a client's product.  Vulnerabilities in Atomic Wallet  Least Authority noted the following outstanding vulnerabilities in their latest audit of Atomic Wallet:  current users are vulnerable to a range of attacks that may lead to the total loss of user funds, specifically due to the current use and implementation of cryptography;  a lack of adherence to wallet system design and development standards and best practices;  a lack of robust project documentation;  an incorrect use of Electron, a framework for building desktop applications, leading to an increased risk of potential security vulnerabilities and implementation errors, as well as out-of-date and unmaintained dependencies.  The company is also calling on Atomic Wallet to conduct and publish ""a full, comprehensive follow up security audit"" from an independent security auditing team once they have fully addressed and resolved the existing vulnerabilities to ensure the fixes have been ""properly implemented.""  Atomic Wallet's ERC20 token, AWC, has fallen from a high of over $2.50 in April of last year to about $0.86 Wednesday night.

42394291,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbPsz,1644501000,"To Understand Bitcoin, We Need to Understand What Money Is","Recently, a popular financial Twitter (or #FinTwit) personality joined the financial TV channel Real Vision and said that “bitcoin is a pretty terrible form of money.” The same day, Fidelity Digital Assets released a report called “Bitcoin First: Why investors need to consider bitcoin separately from other digital assets,” claiming that “Bitcoin is best understood as a monetary good. Bitcoin is likely to be the primary monetary good and another digital asset is not likely to supersede bitcoin in this role.” How can financial experts come to these vastly different conclusions? The answer lies in a misunderstanding of what money is.  This article originally appeared in Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance. Sign up here to receive it in your inbox every Thursday.  What is money, really?  What is money? It’s one of my favorite questions to ask clients. There is no right or wrong answer, and financial advisors rarely ask this question themselves. The key to understanding bitcoin is learning monetary history and gaining knowledge of digital networks. We’ll focus on deconstructing what money is for the first part of this series.  Throughout history, we’ve moved from physical primitive goods, such as money like seashells and wampum, to physical metals like gold and silver to paper receipts backed by physical metals to government-issued fully fiat currencies. “The better the money is at holding its value, the more it incentivizes people to delay consumption and instead dedicate resources for production in the future, leading to capital accumulation and improvement of living standards,” economist Saifedean Ammous wrote in his book “The Bitcoin Standard.” We’ve only known a fiat system during our lifetimes, so it’s not easy to comprehend anything else. Money is what we receive for the economic output we provide to society. Instead of needing a scale to weigh out precious metals, we have a scale in that dollars are our unit of account and our measuring stick on what something costs. Money allows us to specialize and become an expert and pay for expertise from others. Money provides for trade.  Money’s five critical traits  Money does not need to increase in quantity to be effective; it needs to have five critical traits – divisibility, scarcity, portability, recognizability and durability. Gold was money for thousands of years, and an ounce of gold in Roman times bought a tailored tunic, in the 1970s a fitted suit and today a broad array of fine custom suits. Gold, while having scarcity, durability and recognizability, fails miserably at being divisible and portable. Gold receipts and fiat currency solved this issue and allowed global trade to expand.  Fiat currency is outstanding at solving for divisibility, portability and recognizability. The problems lie in scarcity and durability, again missing the mark at being optimal money. Bitcoin has all five properties of money, but, like any money in existence, the demand needs to be there. In a previous article for this newsletter on bitcoin and inflation, I shared data highlighting the growth of demand for bitcoin. NYDIG recently shared that Bitcoin processed $3.0 trillion worth of payments in 2021, exceeding the transaction volume of American Express ($1.28 trillion) and Discover ($504 billion).  How bitcoin functions as money  The stages of monetization for any object over history has followed a similar cycle: the object being collectible, a storage of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Until fiat currency, part of what gave something value was the difficulty in obtaining it or the time to create it.  Bitcoin solves this value proposition by its mining process, called proof-of-work, and the difficulty adjustment, which allows the mining network to adjust up or down the computing power needed to solve for the next block. The difficulty adjustment goal is to help ensure the supply schedule remains very predictable, which is a new block every 10 minutes. It’s an effective, yet simple, solution to a very complicated computer science problem for distributed consensus networks.  Bitcoin mining is costly and time-consuming, yet the verification of the transactions by nodes on the network located around the globe is effortless and almost free. Bitcoin’s most significant benefit is having a final settlement in a digital world in record time, leveraging the mainchain or the Lighting network, depending on the needs of the parties involved. (When measuring speed, you must include “final” settlement – for example, credit card transactions are not finalized before 24 hours.)  The future of money  Money is what allows individuals and businesses to function and thrive. Money that has all five key traits – divisibility, scarcity, portability, recognizability and durability – helps to enhance trade and economies, as all actors use the same unit of measure. Imagine for a minute we are playing Monopoly, and I am the banker – and in each round, instead of abiding by the rules established at the beginning of the game, I institute a new tweak or change. How do you strategize for your turn? How do you plan for the roll after this one?  Money is no different, as individuals and businesses make these decisions subconsciously. And when we all use the same ruler to measure goods and services, that unlocks a more productive society and economy. In my view, bitcoin as money makes that a possibility – it allows for savings, not credit, to be what families run on, quick and inexpensive payments, and an incentive structure to reward value creation. By producing value and living within your means, your purchasing power can increase by simply saving – not decrease like it does today.  Bitcoin is a nearly $1 trillion asset today in a world that is orders of magnitude larger. As Bitcoin becomes a teenager in 2022, what could a world using bitcoin as money be like?

The U.S. Labor Department on Thursday reported last month's increase in the consumer price index (CPI), the most widely followed gauge for tracking inflation, in a statement on its web site. The increase was the fastest since February 1982 and exceeded economists' predictions of 7.3%.  The core CPI, which measures price changes excluding food and energy because they tend to be more volatile, rose to 0.6% month-over-month, the same pace as in December.  Bitcoin (BTC), which some crypto investors believe to be a hedge against inflation because its supply is limited, was down 1.9% in the minutes after the report was released by the Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Thursday. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield peaked over 2% for the first time since 2019.  The biggest driver for overall inflation continued to be used-car prices, with an increase of 40.5% in January from a year ago and 1.5% higher than in December. Food prices surged 0.9% month-over-month, adding up to a 7% increase year-over-year, the highest since 1981. Energy costs advanced 0.9% in January.  What will the Fed do?  With inflation hitting a new high and the labor market hot, many analysts expect the Federal Reserve to be even more aggressive in raising interest rates than previously forecasted. The Fed kept interest rates near zero after the latest Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in January, but hinted at rate hikes starting in March.  ""With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate,” the Fed said in a statement after the meeting.  The cryptocurrency market has seen a sharp drawdown after a period of all-time highs in November, but it has recovered to some extent over the last couple of weeks, which could be a result of the Fed’s hawkishness as inflation has picked up.  “Inflation still has less influence on bitcoin’s price than other speculative factors,"" said Scott Bauer, a former Goldman Sachs trader who's now CEO of Prosper Trading Academy. ""The idea that bitcoin is an inflation hedge has really not been proven yet, it’s still somewhat theoretical.”  However, the recent price movements in the crypto market have partly been caused by economic factors such as inflation and the likelihood of higher interest rates, according to Bauer.  “The Fed is not going to be as aggressive as some are saying that they will. I don't think we're going to get seven or eight rate hikes. I don't think we're going to get a 50 basis point hike in March,” he said.  Regarding a price prediction for bitcoin this year, he can see it go anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000, depending on the overall equity market and decisions made by the Federal Reserve.  “If I had to put odds on one of the two, I'd say it's at 80/20 to the upside rather than the downside,” he said.  UPDATE (Feb. 10, 2022, 14:19 UTC): Adds 10-year U.S. Treasury yield price.

Patrick Hillmann, chief communications officer at Binance, and Bill Chin, head of Binance Labs, will join the Forbes board upon the closure of the combined transaction, which is expected in the first quarter.  “As Web 3 and blockchain technologies move forward and the crypto market comes of age we know that media is an essential element to build widespread consumer understanding and education. We look forward to bolstering Forbes’ Digital initiatives, as they evolve into a next level investment insights platform,” said Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, founder and CEO of Binance.  Binance sued Forbes in 2020 for defamation after the news outlet published leaked documents purporting to outline the exchange's plans for reentering the U.S. market. The so-called ""Tai Chi"" documents laid out a web of corporations and subsidiaries that would allow Binance to generate revenue without directly operating in the U.S. The plan outlined in the documents appeared similar to the actual structure employed by Binance.US, the U.S.-based affiliate of Binance.  The exchange dropped the lawsuit in 2021.  CNBC had earlier reported that Binance was looking to make a $200 million strategic investment in Forbes.

CEO Yves La Rose tweeted Thursday that the foundation is taking steps to hold Block.one ""accountable for its past actions and broken promises. Review of ALL possible legal recourse to seek $4.1B in damages underway.""  The foundation has enlisted a Canadian law firm to investigate Block.one's actions and pledges to the EOS community and investors to determine whether options are available for legal proceedings, La Rose wrote in a blog post.  Having raised $4.1 billion in its initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018, the blockchain protocol fell short of expectations, with La Rose placing the blame squarely on the shoulders of its major backer. The relationship between the two deteriorated, with La Rose saying in November that EOS – a blockchain-based platform to enable the development of decentralized applications (dapps) – was a ""failure"" and its native currency a ""terrible investment.""  The EOS community feels Block.one has shifted its focus and funding – including its vested EOS tokens – to new crypto exchange Bullish, which was unveiled last May with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and digital asset manager Galaxy Digital among its backers.  ""In November and December 2021 we engaged in negotiations with Block.one to attempt to arrange a fair and reasonable resolution with Block.one that would position the EOS community for future success,"" La Rose said.  ""Unfortunately Block.one decided to walk away from the negotiations and as a result the EOS Block Producers determined it was in the best interest of the community to freeze the vesting of all the EOS tokens that Block.one was to earn in the future.""  EOS stakeholders voted in early December to cease Block.one’s EOS token grants, worth $250 million, over a multiyear vesting period.  ""At this point, it is the consensus of the majority of token holders that I speak to, inside and outside of EOS, that Block.one knowingly misrepresented their capabilities and this amounts to negligence and fraud,"" La Rose wrote.  He added that he hoped the EOS Foundation would be to take control of the protocol and guide expansion of the project with the help of fresh investment from venture capital firms.

Tezos branding will appear on the uniform worn by the soccer team's players while warming up before matches, starting with their home game against Southampton on Saturday, the club said Thursday.  Terms of the partnership were not disclosed, though initial reports last week suggested Tezos would be paying in excess of GBP 20 million ($27 million) a year.  The club also plans to introduce several fan experiences built on the Tezos blockchain.  These may include the minting of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Tezos last year partnered with McLaren Racing to build an NFT platform, listing tokens that illustrate the team's history and heritage.  Sponsorship deals between sports teams or events and crypto firms have become more frequent in recent months – crypto exchange FTX and Crypto.com have both been active over the past year. In October Binance, the largest crypto exchange, signed a $30 million sponsorship agreement with Italian soccer club Lazio, and in England's top-tier Premier League, Watford secured a deal with Stake.com that added the dogecoin logo to the players' shirt sleeves.

Major cryptocurrencies saw little movement as XRP increased 3.3%, while Shiba Inu’s SHIB gained 6%.  The moves showcased a recovery in the markets, which started last weekend, after a plunge last month. Total market capitalization crossed $2.12 trillion, adding 2.1% in the past 24 hours. Altcoins outpaced the growth of major cryptos, which led to a decrease in the bitcoin dominance index by 0.4 of a percentage point to 39.6%.  Leading the gains in altcoins was FLOW, the token of gaming network Flow. The token surged 11% on Thursday after the mobile gaming app using the network was officially licensed by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to develop a game based on the Winter Games in Beijing, as reported.  Bitcoin continues to see institutional demand  Some analysts said bitcoin saw institutional demand as prices recovered from under $35,000 to over $45,000 in the past week.  “The benchmark cryptocurrency continues to be in demand after strengthening above the 50-day moving average,” FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich wrote in an email to CoinDesk. “This confirms the breaking of the downtrend of the previous three months.  “For the third week in a row, institutional participants have been investing in crypto funds, according to CoinShares. On the intraday chart, you can see purchases at the close of the American session, which clearly demonstrate the interest of the institutionalists in this region,” Kuptsikevich noted.  Moving averages (MA) are price chart indicators that use past prices to calculate and identify the trend direction of an asset. Bitcoin crossed its 50-day MA earlier this week at the $42,500 price level and has stayed above it since. Continuation of this price movement would imply strength and set bitcoin for a move toward $49,000.  The RSI (relative strength index) values for bitcoin hovered at favorable levels. “The RSI indicator on the daily charts is now at 61, still far from the overbought zone, confirming that the market is still far from overheating,” Kuptsikevich said.  The price chart tool calculates the magnitude of price changes, with readings above 70 being considered “overbought” and below 30 considered “oversold,” which may precede a change in trend.  In financial news, the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program – which helped prop asset prices after the impact of the coronavirus – was on course to book a $4.1 billion loss, according to reports. Meanwhile in India, Shaktikanta Das, the head of the country's central bank, compared cryptocurrencies to the Dutch tulip bulb market bubble of the 17th century.  “Investors in cryptocurrency should keep in mind that they are investing at their own risk. They should also keep in mind that the cryptocurrency has no underlying, not even a tulip,” Das said on Thursday.

If the nature of the HBAR price fall since February has been quite aggressive, now we see a clear slowdown in the fall. HBAR price has tested the $0.2 range and the strength of sellers in this range is low. Although trading volumes in the $0.2 range have not increased and continue to be consolidative, we see that buyers are not ready to allow HBAR price to fall below. https://www.tradingview.com/x/0XOIpJ03/ Starting in late November, the HBAR price began to trade in the consolidation wedge. This type of slowdown often indicates at least a short-term price rebound in the opposite direction. Given the rapid BTC price growth, we expect a local correction of the entire crypto market. In this case, the coin price has a chance to slightly update the local low and test the mark of $0.17. However, keeping this mark, we will expect a sharp reversal of HBAR price with the first target of $0.46.

Zynga has also announced plans to expand its blockchain gaming team from 15 to up to 100 personnel by the end of the year.

NWayPlay’s Olympic Games Jam: Beijing 2022 is a play-to-earn mobile game that was created in collaboration with the International Olympic Committee, according to a press release. Players compete in a series of arcade-styled winter sports to earn Olympic NFT digital pins as they compete for the gold.  FLOW tokens surged to as high as $9 on Wednesday from the previous day’s $6.97 level. Prices have been in a steady uptrend since last week’s $5.50 level. FLOW, however, saw resistance at $8.50 as prices tumbled to $7.94 in early Asian trading hours.  NFTs, short for non-fungible tokens, are blockchain-based representations of tangible or intangible objects. The sector grew from a niche in 2019 to a multibillion dollar giant today, with players from both crypto and traditional companies issuing or using NFTs.  NWayPlay offers players the ability to connect via both custodial and non-custodial wallets, meaning they could purchase in-game assets by credit card or connect to native crypto wallets with the tokens they have earned.  The game is available on both Android and iOS apps and can be accessed with a nWayPlay ID – no wallet connection, unlike most crypto apps, is required to play the game.  The Olympics’ branded game joins other products running on the Flow network. Flow developers said in the release there are 1.2 million registered users on the basketball card trading game NBA Top Shot, 1 million signups for cricket game Crictos and more than 3.7 million individual accounts on Flow.  FLOW tokens, however, have been one of the biggest losers for investors.

42396045,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0dWp,1644471560,Fitch Downgrades El Salvador to CCC Weeks Before Bitcoin Bond Issue,"Ratings agency Fitch has downgraded El Salvador’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating (IDR) to CCC from B- weeks before the country starts issuing its bitcoin bond.  The downgrade reflects “heightened risk stemming from increased reliance on short-term debt, limited scope for additional local market financing, uncertain access to additional multilateral funding and external market financing given high borrowing costs,” Fitch said in a report on Wednesday.  The Central American nation faces close to $1.2 billion in external debt amortizations in 2023, with $800 million due in January, Fitch noted. Fitch also said that the country faces a financing gap of $1.2 billion in 2022, which will rise to $2.5 billion in 2023.  “There is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding other sources of external financing, such as additional multilateral funding, given doubts surrounding an IMF program, as well as the capacity to issue bitcoin-backed bonds,"" the rating agency said, referring to the International Monetary Fund.  El Salvador’s bitcoin-denominated Volcano Bonds offer a 6.5% coupon, compared with the 13% benchmark 10-year yield on El Salvador’s outstanding government bonds.  Analysts previously told CoinDesk that the bonds are effectively a giant long on bitcoin rather than an expression of confidence in the financial prudence of President Nayib Bukele’s government.  “Anyone buying this bitcoin-backed bond is betting on the cryptocurrency in a very big way, ignoring the credit market currently signaling that El Salvador is very much facing a distressed-debt situation,” Marc Ostwald, chief economist and global strategist at ADM Investor Services International (ADMISI), previously told CoinDesk.  At the same time, proponents of the bond program, such as Samson Mow, the founder of Blockstream, the company that developed the bond, said that bitcoin is a way to disintermediate the sovereign debt market and give El Salvador access to cheaper capital.  El Salvador’s bitcoin bond program is expected to be implemented by March 15, according to its finance minister.  Moody’s lowered the country’s foreign-currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to Caa1 from B3 last July, citing El Salvador’s adoption of bitcoin as legal tender.  Bukele had previously tweeted, colorfully, that he doesn't care about the opinions of ratings agencies, renaming the country 'El Hodlador' in a meme.

Everything is out in the open, and the DAO&apos;s spending restrictions are encoded into its code. This article will discuss various reasons which make DAOs effective. Transparency A blockchain records the financial transactions and rules of a DAO. This eliminates the requirement for a third party to authenticate the transaction, allowing smart contracts to streamline those transactions. A smart contract determines the firmness of a DAO. The smart contract holds the organization&apos;s storage and symbolizes the organization&apos;s regulations. Because DAOs are transparent and public, no one can change the rules without others noticing. Trust the DAO&apos;s code and not any individuals involved!

42396054,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAT0deh,1644452907,Caitlin Long's Wyoming Crypto Bank Takes a Step Toward Fed Membership,"Wyoming-based crypto bank Avanti is one step closer to potentially acquiring a master account with the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Avanti Bank now has a routing number issued by the American Bankers Association (ABA), a key milestone in the process to receive a Fed account. Routing numbers are used to identify banks for checks and other transactional purposes and are issued only to federal or state-chartered financial institutions that are also eligible to have a Fed account, according to the ABA’s website.  CoinDesk confirmed that a routing number was issued on the ABA website. An ABA spokesperson didn't immediately return a request for comment.  A number of Wyoming special purpose depository institutions (SPDIs), including Avanti and Kraken, have long sought master accounts with the Fed. Any bank that has such an account is eligible to deposit funds at the Fed and tap the global payments system.  University of Alabama School of Law professor Julie Hill noted on Twitter that Avanti had received a routing number. A routing number in and of itself is not confirmation that a bank has a master account, however, she told CoinDesk.  Any bank trying to secure a master account needs to have a routing number. Often the ABA will ask for an opinion letter from the Fed confirming the entity in question is eligible, Hill said. Usually, that happens if the ABA ""believes it is unclear"" if the applicant is eligible, she said. Once the number is issued, the Fed will begin to process the application.  The Fed can still reject an application after a routing number is issued, Hill cautioned.  “I don’t think that just because Avanti has a routing number necessarily means they'll get a master account, but it’s typically a first step. You have to have a routing number before you can get a master account,” she said.  In November, members of a Fed advisory council made up of executives from banks, thrifts and credit unions voiced concern about the prospects of institutions with novel charters accessing the Fed payments system.  ""If the access is granted, these institutions may introduce increased risks to the financial system,"" according to the minutes of the meeting. SPDIs, the document noted, ""hold uninsured dollar deposits. The deposits will be backed by 100% reserves, and the funds on deposit cannot be loaned by the bank. This structure allows those SPDIs to avoid Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA) supervision.""  Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Avanti, said she is “optimistic that the Fed will grant its applications for a master account and membership” in a statement emailed to CoinDesk by a spokesperson.  “Avanti meets or exceeds the legal and prudential regulation requirements, and has been purpose-built to create a safe and sound bridge between the US dollar financial system and digital assets,” said Long, a Wall Street veteran who has lobbied to make her home state of Wyoming a blockchain industry hub.
