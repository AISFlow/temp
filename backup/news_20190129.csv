42402535,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIdZ,1548801259,AMD Cites 'Absence' of GPU Sales to Crypto Miners in Q1 Estimate,"Graphics card maker AMD announced its ""highest profitability in [seven] years"" Tuesday, but expects its revenue to drop next quarter due at least in part to falling demand from cryptocurrency miners.  The company brought in $1.42 billion in revenue last quarter, for a 2018 total of $6.48 billion – well above 2017's total of $5.25 billion, AMD said in its Tuesday earnings release.  That said, AMD still missed its target revenue by some $20 million, and the release suggested that its revenue from the crypto mining space has disappeared entirely.  ""For the first quarter of 2019, AMD expects revenue to be approximately $1.25 billion, plus or minus $50 million, a decrease of approximately 12 percent sequentially and 24 percent year-over-year,"" AMD stated, going on to explain:  ""The sequential decrease is expected to be primarily driven by continued softness in the graphics channel and seasonality across the business. The year-over-year decrease is expected to be primarily driven by lower graphics sales due to excess channel inventory, the absence of blockchain-related GPU revenue and lower memory sales.""  The company has been warning that demand from the mining sector might disappear for more than a year now. CEO Lisa Su said as far back as October 2017 that the company was ""predicting that there will be some leveling-off of some of the cryptocurrency demand.""  The company reiterated this prediction in its annual 10-K filing last year when it explained that ""the cryptocurrency market is unstable and demand could change quickly.""  The company's GPU sales might suffer from drops in this demand, AMD said at the time.  AMD's subsequent earnings reports proved these predictions accurate. While GPU sales to cryptocurrency miners made up 10 percent of the company's total sales in that area during the first quarter of 2018, the sector's market share went on to drop over the next several months.  AMD's revenue from crypto miners was ""negligible"" in Q3 of 2018, the company announced last October.

42402547,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIhV,1548799209,"From Mar-a-Lago to Coinbase, Dubious Claims Follow Doc.com Token Sales","A health startup tied to a public cryptocurrency is using overstated language about some of its industry relationships and its affiliation with crypto exchange Coinbase as it seeks to sell tokens to investors, a CoinDesk investigation has found.  Mexico City-based Doc.com, which offers an app that provides healthcare and psychology consulting to underprivileged communities, also features a built-in wallet for the startup’s cryptocurrency, MTC. The venture-backed startup raised over $1.8 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2018, then integrated MTC into its app in July of that year as part of a rewards program meant to incentivize users to sell their health data for tokens.  Yet, Doc.com has continued to sell its tokens – $49 million worth in total – even after its ICO at events like the Wall Street Conference at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, held on January 15. The startup said it plans to release these tokens in an airdrop to the public before April when the company switches to a proprietary blockchain called Lifechain.  At Mar-a-Lago, Charles Nader, CEO of Doc.com, pitched token investment opportunities to hedge fund representatives and family offices gathered to hear from notable entrepreneurs like Brock Pierce, showing a pitch deck that included at least two claims that have been substantially debunked by further CoinDesk inquiries.  Most notable is the inclusion of Mozilla CEO John Lilly and LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman on a page of advisors and mentors.  Lilly told CoinDesk he doesn’t have any relationship with Doc.com, while Hoffman’s venture capital firm Greylock Partners told CoinDesk Hoffman has no formal advisory relationship with Doc.com, though Nader was a student of a Stanford course taught by him.  Positioned as a means to provide free healthcare to people who might otherwise be unable to access it, the Doc.com project has attracted interest from organizations like the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime as well as private investors.  But the way the platform functions has raised questions about its token rewards and the security of its users’ health data.  Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer at the Human Rights Foundation, told CoinDesk: “This project deserves a lot of scrutiny and has a lot of red flags.”  On Telegram and Instagram, Nader has also released vague statements about “support” from organizations like Coinbase and Forbes México, which refers to the company as Docademic in a recent cover story about the startup.  Yet in a private message to CoinDesk, Nader clarified there haven’t been any formal discussions about listing the token on Coinbase and that Doc.com is just a custody customer of the exchange. Being a custody customer of the exchange simply means the startup pays for Coinbase to support custody options for its assets.  Coinbase declined to issue a public comment for this story.  Further, on the company’s social media channels users have been actively discussing a potential listing on Coinbase, which Nader and his team have not responded to despite engaging directly with fans about numerous other topics.  Brand-name partnerships?  Some market observers, such as Gladstein, believe Doc.com has come to encapsulate many of the ethical complexities involved with token sales, suggesting that the dynamics behind the 2017 crypto market boom haven’t faded along with the market itself.  Nader said MTC tokens can be used to buy access to healthcare data from more than 141,000 people who already downloaded the startup’s app. Users are said to be paid small amounts of MTC to anonymously release their healthcare data for resale.  Plus, Nader has also said his startup is partnering with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to combat recidivism by expanding its free psychology consultations and other services to Kenya by April.  “We are planning to collaborate with Doc.com, with their new technology to be able to provide free healthcare in Africa,” Wambui Kahara, who serves as a United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime advisor in East Africa, told CoinDesk. “And also to be able to use research to inform governments and others on how to better prevent diseases.”  The UNODC did confirm Kahara's role at the organization but did not respond to a question about its work with Doc.com.  “We monetize that data and sell it to governments and pharmaceutical companies,” Nader told CoinDesk, adding that users can spend MTC on the app to pay for specialist services beyond the free, basic sessions.  Others in the non-profit community, however, are wary of such initiatives. For example, Gladstein of the Human Rights Foundation told CoinDesk he is deeply troubled by the structure of of Doc.com’s token economy.  “There are serious concerns about companies buying medical data from vulnerable populations,” Gladstein said in interview. “If the security model isn’t super strong, there’s potential for abuse.”  Gladstein went on to describe Doc.com as a hotbed of “red flags.” One such concern is that Doc.com has not yet published technical documentation for the upcoming Lifechain ecosystem on open source sites like GitHub.  Nader told CoinDesk there were plans to audit the code “at some point,” without specifying concrete plans with any firm or group.  Warning signs  Another “red flag” noted by Gladstein is that conversations in the company’s social channels are primarily focused on the startup itself and the asset’s trading potential, not app users.  Cryptocurrency promoter John McAfee is listed as one of the startup’s advisors and has been encouraging his Twitter followers to support MTC adoption since last February. One such tweet claimed the tokens could soon sell for $10 each, while another dubbed it the “King of Crypto” assets.

It’s worth about $20,000 USD. So proud of our services. Try our free basic healthcare services at Doc.com already in 24 countries and growing! Thousands of lives saved and positively transformed by @doc.comhealth @docemotions      A post shared by Charles Nader (@chucknader) on Jan 3, 2019 at 11:03am PST          The company’s pitch deck presented at Mar-A-Largo promised investors the likelihood Doc.com tokens would increase in value “is much higher” than bitcoin because the tokens “are used to view healthcare data and linked to real users in the platform that need it.”  Nader also told CoinDesk the value of this token would rise as “demand for the data goes up.” However, the Mexico City-based team isn’t concerned that U.S. regulators could see MTC as an unregistered security even though the company claims to have roughly 20,000 app downloads in Florida.  “It’s a utility token, it’s not a dividend,” Diaz told CoinDesk. “It’s a representation of the data that is being processed on the blockchain.”  Although it’s not clear that any users of the company’s app are posting comments about Doc.com on social media, there are some user reviews of the Doc.com mobile app. However, it’s hard to say how many of the user reviews related to the mobile app are genuine since many are anonymous. And in one instance, CoinDesk identified that Doc.com CTO Arturo Diaz left a positive user review of the app on Google Play without disclosing his involvement in the project.  Beyond technical infrastructure, the Human Rights Foundation’s Gladstein said that paying the participants in local fiat currency or bitcoin would alleviate some of his concerns about the token’s usability.  Otherwise, he said, users are trusting the startup to control this token’s inflation so they can actually afford to buy medical services with their token rewards, regardless of external trading.  While CTO Diaz says the new Lifechain system will offer some form of built-in inflation control, Gladstein said he was still “very concerned” that users may not “actually understand what is going on.”  Gladstein added:  “They [Doc.com] are able to do this because for every person who knows what happened with ICOs, there’s 100 who haven’t learned yet.”  More blockchains  Still, Doc.com believes it has answers to these questions.  The in-house blockchain system Lifechain, which Diaz said his team developed from scratch over the past few months, would be responsible for safeguarding the privacy and consent dynamics of selling users’ healthcare data.  “All the information that you put in the application is encrypted into our health records database,” Diaz said. “You cannot share information from patients without their consent. This [for enterprises] is mostly statistical data, like how many cases of flu happened around this area for males or females.”  So far, Diaz said he’s not familiar with concrete plans to run mining operations or nodes, which will purportedly be powered by proof-of-work, a system wherein any participants are responsible for contributing computing power to ensure record-keeping for the decentralized ecosystem.  “We’re going to look for whoever wants to be the main nodes,” Diaz said, adding that he assumes there is someone at Doc.com speaking to organizations about nodes and mining, because they don’t plan to run that aspect of the infrastructure themselves. “That [mining] is something that I don’t think we are going to get into right now.”  Nader said they are pursuing a relationship with a mining company, plus he believes other miners and node operators will organically rise up from the “community” on Telegram, Twitter and Reddit. But Nader also could not name any specific partners committed to helping run the network scheduled for imminent launch.  “This system is currently much more secure, transparent and vastly better than what is currently available,” he said. “Patients are even getting paid for their data, unlike almost all of the world’s healthcare system.”  Diaz said there are currently around 9,000 MTC addresses and that app users are directly provided with both public and private keys to control their own token rewards. Still, after reviewing the privacy policy on the app, even two tech-savvy MTC traders from Naos Blockchain Capital told CoinDesk they weren’t quite sure whether the startup was already selling their healthcare data.  “You don’t have to think about it as your data, you can think about it as macro data,” Naos Blockchain Capital co-founder Abraham Cobos Ramírez told CoinDesk. “We believe that Doc.com is one of the few crypto projects today with a social mission that already has a working prototype.”  Support from the United Nations, and the prospect of a future listing on Coinbase gave these Naos Blockchain Capital investors confidence in the lucrative potential of this startup’s crypto asset. And, thanks to Coinbase, institutional investors can now hold MTC with a regulator-approved custodial service.  Speaking to Doc.com’s global expansion beyond Latin America, Kahara said:  “The data that is collected goes specifically to research that will benefit these populations…We hope within one year we will be able to cover most countries in Africa.”  Update (Jan. 31, 13:40 UTC): Updated with additional information from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

""Over the next several months, we will throughly engage with and prioritize prospective clients based on needs, jurisdiction and other factors.""  According to the Bloomberg article, bitcoin storage is to come first, followed by ether custody.  A March launch would fit the timeframe previously given by Tom Jessop, the executive in charge of FDAS, who told CoinDesk in December that it would open for business sometime in the first quarter of 2019.  It is unclear when the other part of FDAS – brokering trades of crypto assets between Fidelity clients and market makers – will launch.  The financial services giant revealed last fall that it was building a crypto trading and storage platform. At the time, Jessop said that some of its institutional clients were interested in entering the crypto space, but ""needed a trusted platform provider"" first.  ""These institutions require a sophisticated level of service and security, equal to the experience they’re used to when trading stocks or bonds,"" he said then.  While FDAS initially announced it would support bitcoin and ether trading, Jessop later added that the firm would look to ""the next four or five [cryptocurrencies] in rank of market cap order,"" as well. However, so far customer demand has mainly targeted the world's two largest cryptocurrencies, Jessop said in late November.  FDAS is also looking at security tokens, though Jessup noted then that ""we are waiting for that space to develop"" first.

42402530,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIYe,1548785723,SEC Official Who Oversaw Crypto Cases Leaves for Law Firm Jones Day,"Shamoil T. Shipchandler, a former regional director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) who oversaw several high-profile crypto cases, has left the agency for the global law firm Jones Day.  Shipchandler led a team of around 140 enforcement attorneys, accountants, investigators and compliance examiners in the SEC's Fort Worth, Texas office, the regulator said in announcing his departure. Among other cases, his office brought enforcement actions against would-be token issuer AriseBank and bitcoin futures firm 1Broker.  At Jones Day, Shipchandler will be a partner in the investigations and white collar defense practice at the firm's Dallas office starting at the end of February. In the blockchain space, the law firm notably supported the inception of security token trading platform tZERO and has been known for providing expertise on the legal implications of ICOs and smart contracts. However, it is unclear how involved Shipchandler will be in those areas.  ""Shamoil’s valuable experience furthers our world-class depth in white collar, securities, and data privacy and cybersecurity law practice in Texas and beyond,"" Hilda Galvan, partner-in-charge of Jones Day's Dallas Office, said in the firm's hiring announcement.  The SEC halted AriseBank's initial coin offering (ICO) in January 2018 and its CEO was arrested for securities and wire fraud after the company allegedly lied to investors by claiming it could offer Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured bank accounts, credit and debit cards through Visa and other services. In December, the CEO and COO settled charges by agreeing to pay more than $3 million in penalties.  The agency sued 1Broker, also known as 1pool Ltd., and its CEO Patrick Brunner in September for violating the law while selling security-based swaps to U.S. and international investors. ""International companies that transact with U.S. investors cannot circumvent compliance with the federal securities laws by using cryptocurrency,” Shipchandler said at the time.  However, a month later the company announced plans to reopen, saying that, although its domain was seized, 1Broker had enough funds to cover all withdrawal requests from its users, though it needed permission from U.S. authorities to start doing so.

The company, which also helps other firms run legally-compliant token sales and has invested in a broker-dealer, is launching a beta version of the wallet to all of its existing and future customers today. Known as Knox (after the U.S. Army post where gold is held), it allows enterprises to maintain a multi-signature, self-custody system for different cryptocurrencies, as well as digital securities.  ""It provides the highest level of security when it comes to ... storing digital securities, which [are] newer to the market,"" said TokenSoft co-founder Mason Borda. ""The digital asset industry's been comfortable with storing [coins] for the last few years, digital securities are kind of new ground.""  Digital securities differ from cryptocurrencies in that they tend to be less decentralized and have built-in restrictions for traders, Borda explained, while digital assets such as bitcoin suffer from no such restrictions.  Further, digital securities can be asset-backed tokens, representing equity, debt or real estate, as some examples.  Borda called the Knox wallet ""the first custody solution for digital securities,"" adding:  ""I think it's a key piece of infrastructure that the industry has ignored up until now, and this puts it on the map as a key piece of infrastructure that's necessary to service digital securities.""  All-in-one  The Knox wallet can hold any ERC-20, ERC-1404, DS-20 (Securitize), ST-20 (Polymath) or Harbor's R tokens. It also will support bitcoin and ether, though Borda emphasized that the focus would remain on digital securities rather than cryptocurrencies. However, such securities can be built on top of the ethereum, stellar, R3 or Hyperledger blockchain platforms.  ""What we hear a lot is that it's very easy to use and [investors] wish that they could also manage their bitcoin like this, and so that's why we rolled in support for additional digital assets, though that's not the focus for the product,"" he said.  The different security features included with the wallet range from providing offline cold storage, allowing multiple owners to authorize or execute transactions and cryptographic authentication.  The Knox wallet was first developed in 2017, and while select customers had access to it over the past year, Tuesday's release is ""production grade,"" though the service remains in beta, Borda said. The wallet will be available more broadly to the general public in the coming months, though there is no timeline for this release just yet.

Tangem announced the news Monday, saying the blockchain notes will be used to store the republic's Sovereign (SOV) digital currency, which is being launched as an alternative legal tender in the country. Once issued, the SOV will be officially accepted alongside the U.S. dollar.  Described as ""controllable mechanism of currency issuance and circulation for the state,” the notes take the form of a physical card that is secured with a blockchain-enabled microprocessor. They offer ""immediate"" transaction validation, zero fees and requiring no internet connection to use, according to the firm.  David Paul, minister-in-assistance to the president of the Marshall Islands, said in the announcement:  ""Tangem will help us ensure all citizens, including those living on more remote outer islands, are able to easily and practically transact using SOV.""  The Marshall Islands first announced its plans to issue SOV as a legal tender in February of last year, when it passed the Declaration and Issuance of the Sovereign Currency Act allowing the move in law. Neema, an Israeli startup that facilitates international money transfers via an app, was said at the time to be developing the underlying tech for the new cryptocurrency using a public protocol called Yokwe.  The plan has seen some pushback, however. In September 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advised against the plan to introduce the SOV, stating that if it happened, “external aid and other flows could be disrupted, which would result in a significant drag on the economy.”  Last week, Tangem received a $15 million investment from Japanese financial services giant SBI Group, Through the funding, the firm said it plans to expand its card technology to other areas, such as stablecoins, initial coin offerings, tokenized asset offerings, digital identity and more.

Announcing the news on Tuesday, SBI said that the new venture, SBI R3 Japan, will be setting up and licensing the Corda platform for new customers, as well as providing collaboration with R3’s global offices and other Corda partners. Eventually, the plan is to expand the business across the Eastern Asian region.  SBI Holdings – which says it is the largest outside shareholder in R3 – has a 60 percent stake in the new entity, while R3 has 40 percent, the firm said. The venture launches with capital of 500 million yen (or $4.57 million).  Outside its operations in traditional finance, SBI Holdings is dipping its toes into a number of areas of blockchain-based finance. It notably operates Japan’s first bank-backed, government-licensed cryptocurrency exchange, VCTRADE, which was launched in June 2018 through its subsidiary SBI Virtual Currencies.  Last April, its Russian commercial bank subsidiary SBI Bank LLC joined R3’s Corda platform.  It's also been working with another major blockchain tech provider, teaming up with Ripple last October to launch a consumer-focused blockchain money transfer app called MoneyTap. And, last week, it invested $15 million in Swiss startup Tangem, maker of a slimline hardware wallet for cryptocurrencies.  R3 most recently signed a deal with Dutch banking group ING, licensing the firm for use of Corda Enterprise across its services.

42402549,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIpN,1548759596,Down Again: Bitcoin Is Closing on Key Long-Term Price Support,"View  Bitcoin is again closing on the 200-week moving average, which served as strong support in December. The weekly RSI is more bearish this time round, though, and is reporting undersold conditions.  A weekly close below that level could be followed by a slide back to September 2017 lows near $2,970.  A failure to push prices below the 200-week SMA support would weaken the bears. A bullish reversal, however, would be confirmed only above $3,658 – the high of gravestone doji carved out Saturday.  Bitcoin (BTC) is on the defensive after a drop to six-week lows and could soon test crucial long-term support below $3,300.  The cryptocurrency fell to $3,322 – the lowest level since Dec. 17 earlier today – bolstering the bearish view put forward by Monday's high-volume range breakdown. Trading volumes jumped to 18-day highs near $7 billion yesterday, according to CoinMarketCap data.  The high-volume sell-off has likely opened the doors to re-test of December lows near $3,100.  Moreover, the long-term support level put the brakes on a sell-off back in December, and was followed by a corrective bounce to levels above $4,000.  A strong bounce from the 200-week SMA line would likely embolden the bulls, but the probability of a bull reversal from that SMA support looks low, according to technical indicators.  As of writing, BTC is trading at $3,380 on Bitstamp, representing a 1.5 percent drop on a 24-hour basis.  Weekly chart  As seen above, BTC is again trading within striking distance of the 200-week SMA of $3,298.  The support had held ground on a weekly closing basis (Sunday, UTC) in mid-December, possibly because the relative strength index (RSI) was reporting oversold conditions at the time. This time, however, the SMA support could be breached, as the RSI is currently in undersold territory.  Daily chart  The RSI on the daily chart is also biased toward the bears, as opposed to the record oversold conditions seen in November and December. The 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs) are also trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  Hence, a drop to the December low of $3,122 could be on the cards.  4-hour and hourly chart  The RSIs on the 4-hour and hourly charts are reporting oversold conditions below 30.00. Therefore, a convincing break below the 200-week SMA of $3,298 could be preceded by a minor bounce.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency at the time of writing.

Chainalysis, a blockchain analysis software provider, published a report on Monday indicating that two “prominent, professional” criminal groups are behind at least 60 percent of all publicly reported crypto exchange hacks, netting around $1 billion in total.  ""On average, the hacks we traced from the two prominent hacking groups stole $90 million per hack. The hackers typically move stolen funds through a complex array of wallets and exchanges in an attempt to disguise the funds’ criminal origins,"" according to the report.  The firm has named the two groups as Alpha and Beta, with the former being a “giant, tightly controlled organization partly driven by nonmonetary goals,” and the latter being a “less organized and smaller organization absolutely focused on the money.”  Chainalysis analyzed the crypto transactions of the groups and found that Alpha quickly moves funds after stealing them, with an “extremely high” average number of fund movements– one of the hacks involved up to 15,000 transfers. Alpha also converts up to 75 percent of stolen cryptocurrencies to cash within 30 days.  Beta group, on the other hand, is comparatively slow and waits for 6–18 months before cashing out stolen cryptos, according to the report. And when it decides to cash out, it quickly hits one crypto exchange and cashes out over 50 percent of funds within days. In one example, Beta cashed out about $32 million at one go.  Elsewhere in the report, Chainalysis also found that ethereum scams are increasing in number, though they are smaller in scale. “In 2018, only 0.01% of ether was stolen in scams, worth $36 million, double the $17 million take for 2017.”  Bad actors are also seemingly unaffected by the bear crypto markets. The report states that, in 2018, when bitcoin price plunged by about 80 percent, “darknet market activity nearly doubled.”  “Cryptocurrency crime is evolving to become part of traditional crime, and we think this trend will continue in 2019,” the firm said. “Cryptocurrency market participants will need cutting edge technology and investigative analysis to fight back.”  Back in October, another report from cybersecurity vendor Group-IB suggested that North Korea’s infamous hacking group, Lazarus, has alone managed to steal a massive $571 million in cryptocurrencies behind 14 hacks on crypto exchanges since January 2017.

42402540,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIca,1548752453,ETC Cooperative Adds Developer Bob Summerwill as Executive Director,"Bob Summerwill, a former ethereum core developer, is taking over as executive director for the Ethereum Classic (ETC) Cooperative.  Founded in April 2017, the ETC Cooperative is a non-profit organization created “to financially support the growth and development of the Ethereum Classic protocol,” as stated on the official website.  Although having worked primarily in the ethereum community as a developer for the Ethereum Foundation and lead architect for ethereum venture studio Consensys, Summerwill is by no means bullish on any one cryptocurrency.  “Something I've been talking about a lot through 2018 is this call to an end for tribalism,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview. ""If you look at the whole of blockchain, it's still a tiny thing compared to existing centralized technology bases, but you've got so much factionalism within blockchain where we're really not being as effective as we could be.""  Adding that his goal as executive director for ETC Cooperative would be “helping to get constructive conversation happening within the ethereum classic space and being able to communicate that plan and roadmap,” Summerwill explained that, in his view ETC, has suffered a grave misperception from the public ever since its creation in 2016 following the collapse of the DAO.  Summerwill told CoinDesk:  ""The external perception has really been, ‘Well, here’s a group of zealot-y rebels who parted company with the rest of the ethereum community and are just sore, sick and grumbling in the corner.' The reality is there is interesting technical work happening on the classic side which I see as being additive to what’s happening in the rest of the ecosystem.""  Even when it comes to recent 51 percent attacks suffered on the network, Summerwill contends that community response has been “spot on,” especially when it comes to suggestions made by Anthony Lusardi – U.S. director of the ETC Cooperative – on increasing confirmation wait times.  “Your [ETC] funds are as safe as your private keys are and really the answer is just wait longer for the confirmations. The finality on the proof of work chains is statistical finality. It’s not absolute finality … So I think it’s exchanges that are the entities that are really at need of looking at their practices,” he contended.  All in all, Summerwill expects “some criticism or reaction” to his new role as executive director for ETC Cooperative but maintains that his “door is always open” to anyone.  “I spent a lot of 2018 bridge-building, really trying to pass out the message that we are all brothers and sisters in arms,"" Summerwill told CoinDesk, adding:  ""What I’m really aiming to do in this role is carry that forward in a very practical sense … I’m very excited to step into this role.”  Image courtesy of Bob Summerwill",POSITIVE,ETC,BLOCKCHAIN | ETC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Christine Kim,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/29/etc-cooperative-adds-developer-bob-summerwill-as-executive-director,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9594ec960453cee50b89aefa31697a85e74609d9-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402529,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdKIXf,1548720644,"Iran Could Ban Bitcoin for Payments, Central Bank Report Suggests","The Central Bank of Iran appears set to prohibit ""unapproved"" cryptocurrencies from being used for payments in the country, a draft report obtained by CoinDesk states.  According to a translation of the report entitled ""Obligations and Rules Regarding Cryptocurrencies,"" ""any cryptocurrency wallets will be used only for holding and transferring cryptocurrencies and integrating any kind of services in wallets using cryptocurrencies is forbidden.""  If the plan is ultimately approved, the central bank will effectively seek to block the use of unapproved cryptocurrencies as a means of payment. However, the report indicates that the Central Bank of Iran will not directly restrict anyone from personally holding or transferring small amounts of approved cryptocurrency.  It's not immediately clear which cryptocurrencies will receive approval, though a source with knowledge of the process told CoinDesk that regulators want all bitcoin transactions in the country to be settled in the Iranian rial.  As it stands, the report is in its first draft and is not yet official policy within Iran, according to sources. The report will be discussed during the Electronic Banking and Payment Systems conference in Tehran that starts on Jan. 29, they said.  Plus, Iranians could be barred from holding large amounts of cryptocurrency in the same way they are officially restricted from owning more than 10,000 euros outside of their regulated bank accounts, according to the report.  A Tehran-based cryptocurrency advocate and developer, who spoke to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity, said that the community in Iran is ""shocked"" by the developments and that “this may be worse specifically for businesses that receive bitcoin from foreign customers, since there is little KYC [know-your-customer] procedures with foreign customers and now also businesses can't have their bitcoins directly.”  Rial protection?  Several local sources contended this was a move by the Iranian government’s effort to protect the fiat Iranian rial from competition.  Notably, the report states that tokens pegged to fiat currencies, precious metals and commodities are similarly prohibited as means of payment. That said, tokens pegged to the Iranian rial are allowed provided that they are issued by the central bank itself – a move that Al Jazeera has reported is set to be unveiled at this week’s conference.  The report also states that Iranian exchanges are now obligated to seek licenses, although the document itself offers little clarity on when that process will begin or how exchanges can go about doing so. Further, the report indicates that the central bank will create and update a list every three months for cryptocurrencies that are allowed to be traded on exchanges.  Currently, Iranian exchanges collect know-your-customer information, such as addresses and government-issued IDs, but they otherwise operate more like independent sellers than their corporate counterparts abroad.  ""Getting an exchange license is not an easy task,"" an anonymous blockchain entrepreneur in Iran told CoinDesk, arguing that these regulations could cripple the nascent industry.  On the other hand, he said that at least the government finally recognizes bitcoin as an asset and didn’t completely outlaw it, as there is still some degree of allowance for people to hold and transfer small amounts of crypto for non-commercial purposes.  Still, an anonymous cryptocurrency miner told CoinDesk:  “The nature of cryptocurrencies is they are decentralized. And [this] limit to them eliminates that spirit.”  The draft report (written in Farsi) can be found below:    IT Reg Cryptocurrency 0.0 by on Scribd    Bitcoin and Iran rial image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT,"Leigh Cuen, Stan Higgins",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/01/29/iran-could-ban-bitcoin-for-payments-central-bank-report-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e1fdf3dc5f6e602e8eb2180b60c985351e3474a4-1500x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
