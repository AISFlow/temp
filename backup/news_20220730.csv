Related Reading: Proof of Work Vs Proof of Stake - Laneaxis The Ethereum merge, also known as Ethereum 2.0, is the upgrade of the existing execution of the Ethereum layer 1 from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-state (PoS), Beacon chain. POW was first used by the early pioneers of the blockchain Bitcoin and Ethereum. It aims to achieve decentralization and security by using miners to decode cryptographic algorithms or puzzle-like maths. As the demand increases for transactions, it becomes slow, gas fees increases, and resources intensify. Proof-of-Stake (POS) is similar to POW, just that users authenticate transactions on the blockchain employing stake and get rewarded. &apos;The Merge&apos; is a massive step for Ethereum and the community; it is important to note that the Beacon chain is shipped separately from the Ethereum mainnet. It means the Beacon works in parallel as POS, and all accounts, transactions, balances, and smart contracts remain secured by POW until the final merge to POS.

The &apos;exchange inflow&apos; is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum moving into wallets of all centralized exchanges. When the value of this metric shoots up, it means a large number of coins are being deposited into exchanges right now. Since investors usually transfer to exchanges for selling purposes, such a trend can be bearish for the price of the crypto. On the other hand, low values of the indicator can suggest holders aren&apos;t sending in many coins to exchanges at the moment.

Depending on the variable conversion rate of the Argentine peso, the transfer of midfielder Giuliano Galoppo from Banfield&apos;s Athletic Club to Sao Paulo Futebol Clube cost more than $6 million and as much as $8 million in USD Coin (USDC). Collaboration with the Mexican cryptocurrency exchange Bitso enabled the transfer. The transfer took place amid a challenging financial environment for Argentine sports clubs. Unstable Economic Situation Football players&apos; chances of being signed by international teams are hampered by the stated exchange rate difference between the peso and the dollar, which forces them to renegotiate their contracts to adjust their pay to the fluctuating dollar price. The nation&apos;s unstable economic situation has led to a considerable uptake of cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins. After the unexpected resignation of Argentina&apos;s economy minister earlier this month, the trend for stablecoins is infamously said to have increased. Players and clubs in the nation have also adopted the usage of cryptocurrencies in sports.
