Levin wrote that this past spring, the Midas DeFi portfolio lost $50 million, or 20% of its $250 million in assets under management, and that after the collapse of crypto lender Celsius Network and exchange FTX, 60% of the assets on Midas' platform were withdrawn.  “Based on this situation and current CeFi market conditions, we have reached the difficult decision to close the platform,” Levin wrote, referring to centralized finance.  The company will now focus on a new project that “aligns with our vision for” centralized decentralized finance (CeDeFi), Levin said.  Starting on Tuesday, Midas disabled deposits and swaps, as well as withdrawals, for some time while it makes calculations and balance adjustments. Its target is to deduct 55% from user balances held in bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and stablecoins, with the adjustment being compensated for in MIDAS tokens that can be swapped in for tokens of its new project.  “The goal of the new project is to create a win-win situation by connecting competing protocols with liquidity and offering a simplified yield to a range of DeFi and CeFi audiences,” Levin wrote.

The self-described game theorist admitted his role in draining Mango Markets’ treasury shortly after the incident in mid-October, and may now be the first U.S. resident to face charges for his role in manipulating a decentralized-finance trading platform.  Eisenberg faces charges of commodities fraud and commodities manipulation, according to a filing unsealed Tuesday. The charges could see punishments ranging from fines to prison time.  A deposition signed by FBI Special Agent Brandon Racz alleges Eisenberg “willfully and knowingly” manipulated the sale of a commodity – namely futures contracts on Mango Markets.  “Eisenberg engaged in a scheme involving the intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of perpetual futures contracts on a cryptocurrency exchange called Mango Markets, and other manipulative and deceptive devices and contrivances.”  Read more: $114M Mango Markets Exploiter Outs Himself, Returns Most of the Money  Eisenberg was arrested Monday night in Puerto Rico, according to a second filing signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Burnett.  According to the unsealed complaint, Eisenberg manipulated the price of perpetuals contracts (a type of futures contract popular in crypto markets) for Mango Markets’ native token MNGO. He sold massive amounts of MNGO perpetuals contracts to himself, thus pumping the price of those contracts 1,300% in less than an hour.  Up big time, Eisenberg then borrowed against the value of his position and “withdrew essentially all of the cryptocurrency deposits on the Mango Markets platform.” He made $110 million, according to the complaint.  The platform became “insolvent” as a result, the deposition said, quoting Eisenberg’s own Twitter account.  In the wake of the trade, Eisenberg negotiated with Mango Markets and agreed to return $67 million to the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governing it. Mango DAO planned to return those funds to users who were affected by Eisenberg’s attack.

6532439,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513833,1672182053,Why The Bitcoin Mining Hashrate May Not Be Out Of The Woods Just Yet,"The bitcoin mining hashrate took a sharp nosedive as a historical storm tore through multiple US states. This saw power grids consolidate power to be able to provide enough energy for residents to heat their homes and some mining operations had to wind down to free up more of the electrical. There has been an increase in the hashrate since then but the worst may not be over yet. Bitcoin Hashrate Takes A Beating Electricity grids across the United States came under immense pressure as the country recorded one of its coldest winters yet. Temperatures dropped drastically across various states and the electricity grid was stretched thin to provide enough energy to heat homes. As a result, a number of bitcoin miners decided to pause their operations to free up some energy and this affected the hashrate contributed by the country. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Tops List Of Christmas Gainers, Is $100 Still Possible? By Christmas Day, the global hashrate had tanked almost 40%, dropping from its Dec. 24 peak of 276 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 175 EH/s. However, there was a 39% increase in hashrate on the same day which brought it back up to around 244 EH/s. BTC mining hashrate sees sharp decline on Christmas Day | Source: CoinWarz Since then, the hashrate has continued to wobble day to day and has now dropped back to the 212 EH/s level once more. This shows that while miners may have turned some of their machines back on, they may be shutting them down once more as the extremely cold weather persists. How Long Will This Last? Winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research Judah Cohen said that the Arctic blast currently being experienced in the United States should be short-lived and last about a week before temperatures begin to return to normal. BTC price maintains momentum above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com However, this still leaves a couple of days before it is expected to completely subside. This is evidenced by the zig-zag recovery and dips in the bitcoin hashrate in the last two days following Dec. 25. Miners who have taken their operations offline to help stabilize the electricity grid will likely leave them offline for a while longer until authorities are convinced the weather has stabilized. An example of this was back in July when Riot Blockchain had to shut off its mining machines in Texas as the state faced a heat wave. Related Reading: Bearish Indicator: Bitcoin Volatility Hits All-Time Low Given this, the bitcoin mining hashrate is expected to trend low for another couple of days before bouncing back up. As for the miners, given that Riot had received $9.5 million in energy credits for turning off operations in July, it is possible that some sort of recompense will be offered to the miners.

42388313,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRDXW5,1672178347,Pudgy Penguins NFTs Break All-Time Highs With Holiday Rally,"Pudgy Penguins NFTs are on a Christmastime tear.  The Ethereum-based non-fungible token (NFT) lineup has eclipsed Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and other so-called “blue chip” digital collectibles in 24-hour trading volume – its 1,200 ETH is nearly double that of the runner-up, BAYC, according to data site Nansen.  That surge in trading activity comes as Pudgy Penguins sets new all-time highs in terms of ETH-denominated floor price, a popular metric. At press time, the lowest asking price for a “Pengu” on NFT trading hub OpenSea was 7 ETH. That’s a 32% jump in 24 hours, per Nansen.  The market drama caps Pudgy Penguins’ year-long redemption arc. It began 2022 in the dumps price-wise but then rallied after a change of ownership and refocus on branding.  And the late-December moon mission is lifting all ice boats. Sister collection Lil Pudgys has seen its floor price spike 56% (to 0.69 ETH) and trading volume explode 713% (to 464 ETH) over the last 24-hours. Pudgy Penguin owners are buying their smol counterparts at a faster clip than any other collection, Nansen data shows.  Nansen reports the average Pengu is now selling for 6.5 ETH, surpassing the collection’s previous high-water mark of 6.11 ETH set on December 9. Penguins last showed such market strength when its owner in August inked a licensing deal for Pudgy Penguin toys.  The collection’s revival this year comes under new ownership as Penguin holders ousted the NFT’s founders in January after the original team squandered the project’s treasury with little to show for it.  Four months later, serial entrepreneur Luca Schnetzler (Netz) bought the rights to Pudgy Penguins for $2.5 million and a promise to “build the brand.” He’s since rolled out Pengu licensing deals, a collection marketplace and social media campaign to break into blue chip territory and connect “with everyday consumers.”  That means “making real money and selling real products – not some imaginary web3 setup where you kick back and collect royalties [on NFT resales] all day.”  Netz noted that Pudgy Penguin-branded merchandise – t-shirts, hats and hoodies – have seen an uptick in sales during the holidays. He’s banking on toys and collectibles in the year ahead.  Punk9059, the pseudonymous director of research for NFT club Proof Collective, credits the surge to “the right combination of a very active founder” and “a fair number of influencers getting on board.”  Still, finding the spark for the holiday rally is difficult. Netz admits there’s no traditional catalyst for this change in the market weather.  Except, perhaps, a change in the weather.  “It's the culmination of Christmas and Penguins being a cold animal,” he said.

6521441,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513886,1672167635,Analyst Explains Why Ethereum Is Bullish Against Bitcoin,"An analyst has explained that the absence of miners on the Ethereum network could be bullish for the ETHBTC ratio. Miners Provide A Persistent Selling Pressure On Bitcoin As explained in a tweet by Tom Dunleavy, a Messari research analyst, BTC miners sell almost all the coins they mine. The below chart contains data about the top ten public Bitcoin mining companies, displaying information such as how much each of them mined this year, the amounts that they sold, and the size of their current holdings: Looks like Marathon is holding the largest reserve right now | Source: Tom Dunleavy on Twitter In total, the ten largest mining companies in the space mined a collective 40.7 BTC this year and sold 40.3 BTC. This means that they roughly dumped the entire supply that they mined in 2022 and in the process, applied constant selling pressure on the network. Earlier in the year, Ethereum successfully transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means the blockchain no longer uses miners for handling transactions, and rather uses stakers (investors that have locked 32 ETH in the PoS contract) to act as validating nodes. Related Reading: Bitcoin Selling Pressure Becoming Exhausted? This Metric May Hint So In a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, miners compete with each other using large amounts of computing power. Therefore, many expenses are involved in getting up their facilities, but one cost, in particular, stays with them as long as they continue to operate: the electricity bills. It is because of these electricity bills that miners have to continuously sell what they mine to keep their business sustainable. Some miners try to hold onto their reserves for as long as possible, like Marathon, and Hut8 can be seen doing in the chart. Still, in a market like right now, where electricity prices have shot up while the BTC price has plummeted due to the bear, margins are fine for the already debt-ridden public miners, and thus most of them can’t afford to accumulate. In the case of a PoS chain, however, stakers don’t incur such expenses and thus don’t have any particular need to sell the rewards they earn while staking. This implies that the type of selling pressure that miners put on Bitcoin isn’t present on the Ethereum blockchain.

The duo admitted that they knew of the haphazard relationship between Alameda Research, a trading firm that Bankman-Fried also owned, and FTX and the alleged mismanagement of customer funds.

Bloomberg first reported the news on Tuesday, citing persons familiar with the case.  Between Nov. 11 and the early hours of Nov. 12, massive outflows of cryptocurrencies began moving out of FTX and FTX US’s wallets. Multiple FTX employees told Twitter sleuth ZachXBT that they didn't recognize the transfers.

FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don’t go on FTX site as it might download Trojans.”  The official FTX Twitter account remained silent throughout the pandemonium. In the afternoon of Nov. 12, FTX CEO John Jay Ray III confirmed the hack through a statement posted via Miller’s Twitter account, and said they were in contact with law enforcement.  The criminal investigation is separate from the fraud case against disgraced former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, according to the Bloomberg report, which also said authorities have been able to freeze a portion of the stolen funds.

The digital asset which has now been reduced to the meme coin level still produces massive gains. Presently, LUNC is seeing double-digit gains even at a time when the majority of the market remains muted in terms of price performance. Terra Classic Pulls Big Gains Terra Classic (LUNC) saw a massive rally on Boxing Day that solidified massive gains for investors. Over the last 24 hours, LUNC has been able to rally more than 16% and has successfully broken resistance at the $0.00018 price level. The price recovery follows a return of positive sentiment in the community as a new developer task force called the “Joint L1 Task Force” has proposed to build a Layer 1 Terra Classic blockchain. This comes as the community looks to move on from “Terra Rebels,” the first LUNC developer task force that is now plagued by various accusations. The community has already called for a return of $150,000 that was allocated to the task force previously. Related Reading: Bearish Indicator: Bitcoin Volatility Hits All-Time Low In addition, the Terra Classic community has also voted in favor of Proposal 11111. This proposal reduces the allocation of burned LUNC tokens within an epoch to the community to 10%, revoking the 50% that was previously proposed in Proposal 10983. This effectively reduces the number of tokens that would be brought back into circulation after being burned. Terra Classic price jumps above $0.00018 | Source: LUNCUSD on TradingView.com The proposal passed with 83.35% of votes being in favor and only 11.31% being against. The excitement from this news has also contributed to the rally in the price of the digital asset. More Gains For LUNC? Terra Classic (LUNC) is currently sitting at the top of the list of top gainers on Coinmarketcap over the past 24 hours. With an approximately 17% jump in the last day, the digital asset defies a market that has seen slow movement, especially with bitcoin volatility dropping to all-time lows. Terra Classic tops lists of gainers | Source: Coinmarketcap LUNC, on the other hand, tends to thrive in times like these. This is because, with the low momentum, larger assets such as bitcoin and ethereum are unlikely to move much, but with low-price cryptocurrencies such as LUNC, it presents an opportunity for investors since it is easier to move the needle. Couple this with the recent rise in positive sentiment in the community and it is a recipe for success. Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Tops List Of Christmas Gainers, Is $100 Still Possible? Its price has now reached its second-highest level for the month of December after successfully touching above $0.00018 in the early hours of Tuesday.

Kaplan replaces U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, who recused herself from the case on Friday because of a potential conflict of interest because her husband is a partner at law firm Davis Polk & Waddell, which advised FTX in 2021 and is now advising parties possibly adverse to FTX and Bankman-Fried in the exchange’s bankruptcy proceeding, according to Abrams.  Bankman-Fried is under house arrest on a $250 million bond and is scheduled to appear before the federal court on Jan. 3.  Kaplan was appointed to the Manhattan federal court by President Bill Clinton in 1994 and has presided over a number of high-profile cases, including Chevron’s 2014 appeal of an environmental case in which he ruled in favor of the oil giant, and 2021 sexual-assault case brought against Prince Andrew by Virginia Giuffre, which was settled out of court.  In 2020, Kaplan criticized some plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against blockchain firm Block.one for appearing to be an attempt to earn high legal fees. Block.one eventually agreed to pay $27.5 million to settle that case in a court-approved settlement.

In an affidavit provided to a Caribbean court before his arrest, Bankman-Fried said he and FTX co-founder Gary Wang together borrowed over $546 million from Alameda via promissory notes in April and May. They used that money to capitalize Emergent Fidelity Technologies Ltd., the shell corporation that in May bought a 7.6% stake of Robinhood.  The affidavit provides a new curveball in the three-way race to lay claim to the 56 million Robinhood shares. Crypto lender BlockFi, FTX Group and Bankman-Fried himself have all attempted to lay claim to the shares, which could be worth over $440 million.  Crypto lender BlockFi, which like FTX has filed for bankruptcy, alleged in a court document that it was owed the rights to the Robinhood shares due to a deal Bankman-Fried made in early November. The shares were pledged as collateral against a loan taken out by Alameda Research – the same firm whose funds were used to purchase the shares to begin with, according to Tuesday's filing.

42413329,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8R14,1672153175,"Solana DeFi Project Mercurial to Relaunch as 'Meteora,' Replace MER Token","Decentralized finance (DeFi) trading project Mercurial plans to relaunch as “Meteora,” issue a new token to nearly all MER holders and expand its trading lineup in an aggressive attempt to distance itself from Sam Bankman-Fried’s fallen empire.  The stablecoin exchange’s planned rebrand has major ramifications for owners of MER, a token that has fallen 46% since FTX’s collapse. It is being abandoned in favor of the new Meteora token whose maximum supply is 100 million, 1/10th the mint of MER. Most MER owners will receive the new token in amounts proportional to their current holdings, according to plans reviewed by CoinDesk.  But insiders will take a big hit. Mercurial’s seed investors, private investors and team members – major backers who controlled 45% of all MER tokens under Mercurial's original plan – are slated to get a 50% haircut on their unvested tokens, said Ben Chow, the co-founder of sister protocol Jupiter Finance. He says the shakeup will boost token owners' influence over the reconstituted project.  Meteora is the latest Solana-based crypto protocol to reimagine itself in the fiery ashes of the FTX and Alameda Research. Sam Bankman-Fried’s highly-interconnected crypto exchange and hedge fund were kingmakers in the Solana DeFi ecosystem as top venture investors and market-makers. Their demise has gutted nearly every Solana-based trading protocol, including Mercurial, which issued its token in a sale hosted by FTX.  When, hours after FTX Group declared bankruptcy in November, a hacker sacked the exchange’s ruins, they also snagged a major haul of MER tokens then worth $800,000. That heist gave Mercurial’s team a pretext to revamp the entire protocol, Chow said. (The hacker’s address is being blacklisted from the airdrop, as are all associated with FTX.)  “Originally it was just going to be a product under Mercurial with the MER token but because of what happened with FTX that became a catalyst for us saying, “Hey we really need a new token, not just a new product.”  Indeed, Meteora has been in the works since at least September as Mercurial’s novel yield-generating DeFi product, called a dynamic automated market maker. Chow said Meteora’s AMM vaults get extra yield on depositors’ assets by loaning excess capital to lending protocols. This generates lending yield on top of the trading fees from the AMM.  Of course, it also increases the risk that something could go wrong and assets are lost or stolen. Chow acknowledged the heightened chance of getting rekt but said high risk tolerances are par for the course in DeFi. Besides, he said, the protocol rebalances loans automatically. “We will withdraw faster than you could.”  Other DeFi protocols will be able to build on top of Meteora to “stack the yield” and get future upside, he said.  Snapshot  The snapshot that determines new token holdings will happen in late December or early January, according to the plans. In January it will launch a yield-generating product called dynamic vaults, issue the new token, wipe the Mercurial social media and begin moving control to the community.  Meteora will move “substantial leverage” over protocol operations to token-holders in a newly launched “decentralized autonomous organization,” per the new plans. This is the first time the protocol will have a DAO.  One of their first decisions will be what to do with the MER owed to the hacker’s address, Chow said. They also get major influence over how Meteora manages circulating supply.  “This plan allows us to clear all uncertainties surrounding our tokenomics and pave the way for a clean and transparent token setup for the ecosystem and project moving forward,” the plan read.  First, Chow and other Jupiter and Mercurial/Meteora team members plan to walk the community and investors through the plans with town halls.  “It stands a really good chance of being a decentralized yield layer for solana so I imagine they will be equally supportive,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/23/solana-defi-project-mercurial-to-relaunch-as-meteora-replace-mer-token,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e81842d13f28a5733752f6596576bb6c7601e2ea-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42417071,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOXd,1672151828,"DeFi Is the Way Forward, but It Needs to Evolve","The recent events in the crypto markets have reaffirmed the value proposition of decentralized finance (DeFi) as one of the core building blocks of the future of digital assets. However, the DeFi space has also been impacted by the changes in the market because many of the top participants in DeFi have effectively disappeared. This combination of events creates a very strong friction for the future of DeFi. In some ways, the challenges with centralized financial (CeFi) institutions should favor the adoption of DeFi protocols. On the other hand, the fundamental market conditions that triggered the recent DeFi summer are not present anymore. While we can all agree that DeFi should be a key component of the next phase of the crypto market, the specifics are far from trivial and, most likely, will require significant changes in the industry.  Jesus Rodriguez is the CEO of IntoTheBlock. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  The DeFi adoption paradox  From a philosophical standpoint, DeFi is the one movement that encompasses the true ethos of decentralization, censorship resistance and financial inclusion. The recent DeFi rush was marked by both a tremendous level of innovation in protocols but also a disproportional wave of artificial incentives that fomented unsustainable yields and attracted participation from some of the biggest companies in the crypto space. The recent changes in composition in the crypto market have caused the total value locked (TVL) in some protocols to be at a multi-year low and activity in some DeFi ecosystems to be virtually nonexistent. Still, DeFi protocols have largely remained incredibly resilient while some of the biggest centralized institutions in crypto have completely collapsed.  The crypto market is relatively small, and CeFi and DeFi are intertwined in an almost paradoxical way. While the DeFi infrastructure was able to sustain the recent market shocks, the collapse of CeFi institutions has put a lot of pressure on DeFi protocols.  Simply put, DeFi blossomed in a market that doesn’t exist anymore. To fully realize its potential in the new reality of crypto, DeFi needs to evolve. But that evolution can translate into massive opportunities. For DeFi to find its place as the financial services foundation of the crypto space, there are five key areas where it needs to improve.  Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023 | Opinion  Capital efficiency  The first generation of DeFi primitives that have dominated the market embody the principles of democratizing access to programmable financial services, but they do so at the expense of capital efficiency. Automated market makers (AMM) are an incredible innovation to foment transparency in financial markets, but they lack the efficiency of centralized order books. Overcollateralized lending has powered amazing innovations like flash loans – but it is the textbook definition of capital inefficiency.  Building a new wave of DeFi protocols with a robust capital efficiency foundation is paramount to streamlining the adoption of DeFi. Ideas such as hybrid decentralized exchanges (DEX) that combine order books and AMM mechanics or semi/undercollateralized lending protocols are likely to unlock some of the value in this area.  Credit  Crypto credit markets have been under stress for the last few months. Many of the market leaders in discretionary lending have gone out of business or remain unable to operate. As a result, building new mechanisms for credit in a transparent way has become one of the most attractive opportunities in the crypto market. The way to improve credit in DeFi is to build new forms of undercollateralized or semi-collateralized lending. While there have been some attempts in this space they can hardly be considered DeFi and have suffered from the native risks of lending to market makers. Alternatives that lend to parties with predictable on-chain activity such as staking providers, miners or DeFi protocols might be interesting to explore in this area.  New financial primitives  The majority of the activity in DeFi today is dominated by two main protocol primitives: market making and lending. While those components are certainly important, they are hardly sufficient to build an efficient financial market. DeFi is in desperate need of new financial primitives that achieve the level of traction experienced by AMMs and lending protocols.  Derivatives seem to be the obvious place for expanding the set of financial primitives in DeFi because they play a role in capital efficiency and risk management. The DeFi derivatives space has been steadily growing, and protocols such as Ribbon or GMX have certainly showcased the potential of the space. However, most DeFi derivative protocols still haven’t achieved meaningful adoption and more innovation is certainly needed in the space.  See also: There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good Thing | Opinion  Risk management and insurance  The events of the last few months have put risk management at the top of the list of requirements for institutions to participate in DeFi. Risk takes a very different form in DeFi than it does in traditional markets and, therefore, requires a new form of risk management technologies. The initial risk management efforts in DeFi have centered around technical smart contract exploits that, although important, only represent a portion of the risks investors face participating in DeFi.  Economic risk management represents one of the biggest opportunities to catalyze institutional adoption of DeFi. Solutions that manage economic risk conditions such as pool compositions, depegging scenarios, slippage, whales’ impact and many others are required to establish the level of rigor that large capital market institutions need to adopt DeFi at scale. One of the most interesting expressions of risk management will be insurance products. Economic insurance in DeFi remains a largely unaddressed problem and limits the options for creating sophisticated institutional structured products on DeFi rails.  TradFi bridges and real world utility  For the last two years, DeFi has remained a crypto-to-crypto market with very limited exposure to off-chain applications. While the crypto-centric dynamic has been key to accelerating innovation in the space, it limits the sustainability of DeFi as a financial market. For instance, sustainable yields in financial markets do not only come from market asymmetries but also from creating utility in businesses in the real world. DeFi needs to recreate a similar dynamic.  Building bridges to traditional finance (TradFi) applications can bring a new wave of utility to DeFi that translates into new avenues of financial activity. Protocols like MakerDAO have been experimenting with ideas in this area by extending loans to financial institutions.  Thoughtful regulation  When it comes to DeFi, very few topics are as polarizing as the discussions regarding regulation. Regardless of which side of the regulatory argument you sympathize with, it is hard to argue with the fact that the recent changes in the crypto market composition have catalyzed a more aggressive regulatory agenda that is going to touch DeFi at some point.  Regulation can certainly be harmful to the innovation taking place in DeFi but, when implemented thoughtfully, it represents an interesting opportunity for institutional adoption of the space. Many regulated financial institutions struggle with reconciling the financial benefits and opportunities of DeFi with the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the space. Protocols that implement forms of regulatory controls can certainly fill that vacuum. Most of the initial efforts to force know-your-customer (KYC) routines upon DeFi protocols have seen limited adoption, but there are interesting opportunities to leverage on-chain data for regulatory assessments of protocols. Brute force regulation could be very harmful to DeFi, but thoughtful regulatory controls might open the door to new waves of institutional adoption.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MKR | REGULATION,Jesus Rodriguez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/27/defi-is-the-way-forward-but-it-needs-to-evolve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2e217a92cf482065007607cbf66fd4dfef37ceb8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Miner Selling Power Has Plummeted In Recent Days As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, there has been less selling pressure from the miners recently. There are two relevant indicators here, the miner supply and the miner outflow. The first of these, the miner supply, is simply a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin currently sitting in the wallets of miners. The other one, the miner outflow, is a metric that keeps track of the total number of coins that miners are transferring out of their supply at the moment. Now, the “miner selling power” is defined as this miner outflow divided by the miner supply (30-day moving average, log-scaled). When the value of this indicator is high, it means miners are transferring out large amounts compared to their total supply right now. Since miners usually take out their BTC for dumping purposes, this trend can be bearish for the value of the crypto. On the other hand, low values suggest miners are spending relatively little amounts currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Signal? Small Investors Show Rapid Accumulation The below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner selling power over the last few years: The value of the metric seems to have taken a plunge in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As the above graph displays, whenever the Bitcoin miner selling power has reached high values and set a local peak, the price of the crypto has seen some downtrend. This trend makes sense as highs in the metric suggest increased selling pressure from these chain validators. Recently, the indicator again showed such a formation, and BTC reacted with a decline this time as well, as its price went from more than $18,000 to the current $16,000 level. However, since this recent peak, the miner selling power has been rapidly going down and has now set a new low. Related Reading: Bitcoin Selling Pressure Becoming Exhausted? This Metric May Hint So This muted selling pressure from miners may not necessarily be bullish by itself, but it does mean that if Bitcoin shows any bullish momentum now, miners wouldn’t provide any impedance to it for the time being. An interesting long-term trend to notice in the miner selling power chart is that the metric has been on an overall downtrend in the last five years or so. This means that over time, miners have been selling lesser and lesser BTC compared to their reserves, suggesting that they have been accumulating and growing their supply instead. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,800, up 1% in the last week.

Following the collapse of multibillion-dollar stablecoin issuer Terra earlier this year, Japan's parliament passed a set of rules specific to stablecoins and focused on investor protection.  The new rules on foreign stablecoins would be applied in conjunction with the revised Payment Services Act, according to Nikkei. The framework is open for public comment until Jan. 31 and will come into force later next year.

This entertainment- and sport-based blockchain platform is built on Socios and allows fans to interact with sporting brands and teams. Here’s a quick glance at how the crypto is performing so far: Chiliz plunges by 0.70% Sellers are seen to dominate the bearish market CHZ has trimmed down as much as 64% in just 50 days With that said, users can fully take advantage of the platform to stake and dish out exclusive information and news tidbits from their favorite sporting teams, plus also freely share their opinions on the latest news. The 2022 FIFA World Cup gave Chiliz a boost as it pumped up the orders. However, Chiliz can’t seem to keep up with the rest of the cryptocurrencies and has been lagging behind or going downward spiral. CHZ Currently Trades At $0.1085 According to CoinMarketCap, CHZ is down by 0.70% or trading at $0.1085 as of this writing. With this scenario, the sellers clearly have the upper hand while the buyers need to hang on and wait for the market to switch to bullish and stabilize in terms of demand before placing any bids. Chiliz is a crypto exchange with the CHZ token explicitly designed for buying fan tokens that give users the ability to decide and govern regarding certain policies, stadium names, team lineups, franchises, and selection of players. In addition, the CHZ token also functions similarly to BEP2 on Binance and ERC20 token on Ethereum.

Now, when the lows in this range were breached and then retested as resistance in December, this has shown how sellers have the evident upper hand in the market. RSI for CHZ is seen to have dipped below the neutral range of 50 on November 20. It is currently sitting at 9.2, which means it has reached the oversold zone. Considerably, the CMF also moved down in the same period with sizeable capital flushed out of the market. Chart: CHZ/USDT on TradingView Over the past few days, the Fibonacci extension level, which acted as support, was spotted at 24.3% across the $0.107. Sellers can shoot towards going short, given the 21-period MA, which worked as resistance this month. Sellers can then target $0.088 and $0.073 rendered as take-profit levels.

42417091,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOn7,1672150343,The Voice of Layer 1s Is Needed in Washington,"The policy environment for crypto in 2022 began full steam ahead. The industry had grown significantly, institutional adoption was growing by leaps and bounds and policymakers had taken notice. Many of the players on the financial side of crypto, including the exchanges and those building financial products on blockchain, ramped up their involvement in the policy conversation in Washington, D.C.  Policymakers that had been historically skeptical began to see the value of the technology and the growing impact it could have on traditional financial markets. Critics were being increasingly sidelined, given the perception of tremendous opportunities in the space, and friendly regulation appeared to be in the offing. With regulatory certainty being addressed, the industry could flourish. In May 2022, that positivity in the policy community came to a screeching halt.  Chris Hayes is a senior government relations executive focused on financial regulation. He previously led global government relations for a layer 1 blockchain. This article is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  The collapse of Terra’s UST stablecoin (which, behind closed doors, some in Web3 talked about as being inevitable) as well as that of many centralized lending platforms in the crypto space sent the industry into a cold winter and provided a strong narrative to skeptics of not only the crypto industry but, worse, the usefulness of blockchain technology itself. The implosion of FTX in November has provided more fuel to this narrative, with significant consequences for policy making. An organization that presented itself as the poster child for responsible management and consumer protection turned out to be a house of cards, even worse than the Enron example.  For all the losses to depositors, customers and damages to the industry’s reputation, the FTX implosion surprisingly has also resulted in an opportunity. There now appears to be some bipartisan consensus in the U.S. Congress that new digital assets legislation is needed to protect consumers. The 118th Congress that begins its work in January will likely pass some sort of regulatory framework for crypto and blockchain technology in 2023 or 2024. This framework will shape the way the industry operates for years to come. This is why it’s critical that the entire Web3 industry be involved in that conversation, and most critically, layer 1 blockchains and the builders on these platforms.  I often hear from those new to Web3 or blockchain technology (including in my old TradFi world) that they “see the value of the blockchain technology, but that crypto is worthless.” Unfortunately, these comments are common by those who don’t realize that a blockchain needs native cryptocurrency to process transactions, incentivize validators and secure the network. Those less familiar with the technology, including many policymakers hostile to crypto, still haven’t heard of the job creation and economic growth potential of the companies building on top of blockchain infrastructure. Layer 1s, as the building blocks to the entire industry, must bring these founders and companies to the forefront to tell the story of the technology and its potential for real-world application. A technology-forward message is needed now, not a financial message.  See also: The End of Crypto Twitter as We Know It? | Opinion  Any new crypto legislation or Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation must provide clarity for layer 1s and their native tokens while ensuring sufficient consumer protections. This means finally addressing the lack of clarity around the application of the Howey Test to these types of digital assets, including delineating whether they belong under Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) or SEC jurisdiction. Should certain layer 1 native tokens ultimately be considered securities, any legislation or SEC rulemaking must provide safe harbor for those existing blockchain tokens in circulation and must arrange for an updated SEC registration regime that addresses the technological differences presented by digital assets. If the SEC will not begin a rulemaking process utilizing its existing authority, Congress must require the regulator to do so.  Industry leading layer 1 blockchains must collaborate on policy engagement, delivering a uniform message that regulatory clarity is needed beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum.

42417082,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcRpOm5,1672150105,The Psychological Differences Between Bitcoin and Ethereum Governance,"In 2021, Bitcoin and Ethereum accelerated further into the mainstream as the leading two blockchains on the planet, respectively. Both networks have deeply dedicated communities and developers working to protect and evolve the peer-to-peer technological innovations.  Crypto advocates enjoy both systems for their unique characteristics and economic principles. Bitcoin has an extremely strict monetary policy aiming to be the most sound, decentralized money on the planet. Ethereum is an ever-evolving general purpose blockchain, which, one can debate, has sound money attributes but with a less-predictable token issuance schedule.  Bill Ottman is the CEO and co-founder of Minds.com. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  The majority of crypto users, investors and developers think multiple technologies can coexist. Some think bitcoin could be considered the hardest money known to humankind, while also acknowledging that Ethereum has creative capabilities in decentralized finance (DeFi) and notable smart contract composability.  However, there’s a massive, exhausting debate between so-called “maximalists” on both sides who are hypercritical of the other network. Bitcoin maximalists dislike the term “crypto” itself because it conflates Bitcoin with scams and muddies the waters for new adopters. (Crypto derives from cryptography, the underlying security foundation that makes decentralized monetary networks possible.)  The practice of calling anything other than Bitcoin a scam (or, less artfully, a s**tcoin) is sometimes labeled “toxic maximalism.” Online bitcoiners who defend the network against detractors and attack “imitators” are what MicroStrategy’s former CEO Michael Saylor called a “cybernetic immune system.” Historically, maximalism isn’t rare in tech – though it often results in embarrassment for any outspoken critics of, say, cars, planes, phones and the internet.  Whatever the technological differences separate Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s clear both networks also have a strong cultural and psychological divide. These different ecosystems and different aims have an impact on how the networks will progress.  For instance, non-technical bitcoiners often say that “Bitcoin can’t be changed,” but let’s take a look at the specifics of both governance models and how exactly they are, in fact, different.  Read more: End of the Monopoly: How Bitcoin Will Usher in a New Era of Governance in Crypto  This year, Ethereum transitioned from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake (consensus algorithms that determine how blocks of transactions are added to the chain). Last year, Bitcoin introduced Taproot, which reduced transaction fees, increased privacy and provided more wallet functionality. It is likely that the next major change will be BIP-119, which could provide additional benefits for the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s scaling layer).  Not long ago I had the opportunity to interview former Bitcoin Core developer Samuel Dobson to learn how the governance and development process actually works in Bitcoin. Typically, there aren’t nearly enough technical details discussed when communities criticize the other’s governance processes. It’s doubtful that most critics have ever even spoken to a core developer on either side.  Shared ground  Apart from the handful of tools common to most blockchain governance processes (like Git merge requests and comments, live chat and mailing lists), Bitcoin and Ethereum do have their similarities.  Both projects have relatively small groups of core developers (counted in the dozens). In the case of Bitcoin Core, only a few have commit access (aka maintainers, or those who can set updates to go live). Both projects utilize “rough consensus,” have long periods to scrutinize proposals (i.e., BIPs and EIPs, or Bitcoin or Ethereum Improvement Proposals) and make minor changes quite regularly. In Bitcoin these changes are called “standardness rules,” which are not consensus critical and can be changed relatively often.  Both projects have also had rare bugs that have been dealt with in relatively centralized ways.  For Bitcoin: On Aug. 15, 2010, a hacker created over 184 billion BTC due to a number overflow error. Bitcoin's total supply is meant to be capped at 21 million, so clearly this wasn’t acceptable. Ninety minutes later, Jeff Garzik spotted the issue. Satoshi can be found discussing a fix here and then implementing it. He said, “Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations.”  For Ethereum: In 2016, shortly after The DAO launched and raised $150 million worth of ether (ETH) through a token sale, this first decentralized autonomous organization was hacked due to vulnerabilities in its code base. The Ethereum blockchain was eventually hard forked to restore the stolen funds. Not all parties agreed with this decision, resulting in the network splitting into two distinct blockchains, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.  What’s different?  At the most basic level, Ethereum doesn't work like Bitcoin in that it doesn't have a single reference implementation. Each implementation has committers (e.g., Go-Ethereum, Nethermind, Besu, Erigon) but none of them is sufficient to change the entire protocol.  Bitcoiners typically resist “consensus changes” that are changes that could create a fork and change the fundamental rules of the peer-to-peer (P2P) networking protocol. “Standardness rules,” however, are more flexible due to not being consensus critical. Bitcoin resists hard forks but accepts soft forks, which are not consensus changes, but are a strict subset of the previous rules. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin actually wrote about the issue.  Ethereum has a specification (spec) that multiple clients are based off (the aforementioned Geth, OpenEthereum, Besu, Nethermind, Erigon), while Bitcoin Core is what all Bitcoin clients are based on (Bitcoin Core, Knots, Rust BTC, BTCD).  Read more: 23 Blockchain Predictions for 2023  At the social level, Ethereum has the Ethereum Foundation (EF), which was founded to help direct development of the network and was funded through the sale of ETH. Bitcoin Core is not a legal entity, it is software.  In reality, both projects have numerous legal entities involved. While the Ethereum ecosystem is definitely more reliant on a smaller set of entities (EF, ConsenSys), there is no one entity that is the central coordinator. If EF or Consensys disappeared tomorrow, Ethereum development could continue as there are many independent teams developing core clients and other components of the ecosystem. Considering the number of players involved in the Merge, it’s a ridiculous criticism to say Vitalik is essential to its continued existence.  Likewise, Satoshi Nakamoto actually disappeared. This left Bitcoin without a specific human to direct the network or target to take it down – a feature, not a bug. However, Bitcoin Core is still a loose organization, with owners of a Github account and reportedly a multisig wallet used for funding developer travel and accommodations at meetups. This wallet is intentionally kept on a need-to-know basis.  Finally, generally speaking, Bitcoin favors soft forks and Ethereum favors hard forks.  A limited debate  Too often the debate between Ethereum and Bitcoin about how to address protocol governance lacks perspectives from core developers. In reality, there’s a limited understanding of what’s actually happening on the ground for both networks.  There have been a couple of useful interviews to come out of the “What Bitcoin Did” podcast hosted by Peter McCormack where a former Ethereum core team member, Lane Rettig, expressed concerns about the centralization of control in Ethereum (though he admittedly still supports the project). What was frustrating about the podcast was the lack of technical specifics from the Bitcoin Core perspective.  In reaction to the interview, Tim Beiko of the Ethereum Foundation said, “FWIW, most people in the Ethereum community I've spoken to disagree with a lot of Lane's criticism. It's a [three-hour] interview, so it's quite long to refute, but I wouldn't paint it as the consensus Ethereum view.”  The ""Bankless"" podcast held a productive debate called “BTC vs ETH: Which is Better Money?” which covered some nuances of the process of both sides. But the conversation, like most conversations contrasting BTC and ETH, had more to do with economic policy than governance itself. The humans involved and tools used to govern matter greatly.  The last podcast worth mentioning had Alex Gladstein debating Erik Voorhees on how the different blockchain technologies work and their varying levels of decentralization. The very concept of a “spectrum of decentralization” is positive – and shows how both Bitcoin and Ethereum have their own weaknesses and benefits. Voorhees argued both are overwhelmingly similar – though noted a clear difference in that Bitcoin’s economic policy sets it up as a long term sound money system.  Sounding off  Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are fascinating networks whose differences help the world become more decentralized because they thrive in complementary areas. It’s also beneficial that certain people are interested solely in one or the other.  Decentralization applies to both computing power and governance, and both are essential in determining the holistic level of decentralization.  Samuel Dobson, the former Bitcoin core dev, expressed to me in our conversation that the difference is largely psychological with the participants. Bitcoin’s purpose is for maximum predictability and security, while Ethereum is more focused on constant innovation and composability.  He said, “The Bitcoin community has a kind of in-built inertia. It's really hard to change things because it is really hard for a lot of people with diverse interests to agree on the changes. A lack of ‘leadership’ is a feature not a bug in this world.  “Things moving slowly ensures that things are done safely with plenty of discussion, review and testing. We've seen first hand on certain forks of Bitcoin the impact of big changes being rushed through. In this way, the psychology of the Bitcoin community is a big part of its decentralization.  Read more: Ethereum Developers Target March 2023 for Release of Staked Ether  “Ethereum, on the other hand, places a lot more trust in Vitalik and the others to decide on the direction of the protocol. That's not to say they all follow blindly, of course – it is still an open-source project with review and discussion. But the endorsement of a relatively small group of individuals there allows much bigger changes to proceed much faster.  “Their leadership is very centralized compared to Bitcoin's. I think that difference is more psychological than tangible: They're willing to sacrifice decentralization of development in favor of the ability to move quickly and ""experiment"" with lots of new changes.”  In reaction, Ethereum’s Beiko noted Bitcoin has a few core devs with much more social capital and influence than the average contributor. Ethereum is similar in that regard – even if criticisms of Vitalik’s continued presense often feels like a strawman. By the numbers, Ethereum has many more people involved in its development.  “In many ways, our development process is more decentralized,” Beiko said. No one person in Ethereum can “unilaterally force a change.”  In the end, both network’s continued existence – despite the perceived threats they present to the established order – show what decentralization really means.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETC | TOKEN SALE | FORKS,Bill  Ottman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/27/the-psychological-differences-between-bitcoin-and-ethereum-governance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b06d36d42b222b3c6659bcd5d0b3318c41a5b362-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As the SHIB community observed, Shytoshi Kusama has once again updated his profile. The Shiba Inu lead developer’s status now reads “We Are Not Alone.” In addition, Kusama’s current Twitter location says, “With a new fren…guess who?” The SHIB community is now puzzling over whether the mysterious announcement could have to do with a new partnership or the launch of Shibarium, a layer 2 solution. Hey $SHIB Family @ShytoshiKusama has once again updated his profile. ""We Are Not Alone"" and ""With a new fren…Guess Who"" Could it have anything to with a new partnershib or maybe even #SHIBARIUM? I am stumped. Help me out here family. pic.twitter.com/fX6AAhTpUB — Shib Dream * Shiba Inu News * Shib Army Social 💎 (@theshibdream) December 27, 2022 As recently as Christmas Eve, Kusama tweeted that Shibarium will be released very soon, emphasizing the importance of next year for the project: Happy Holidays to more than half the world. Wen Shibarium? Please know it will come very soon*, but not during a crucial time for people to spend with their family (or the resulting New Years party time). Enjoy these next days, next year is an important one for humanity. Therefore, probably the hottest bet for the mysterious announcement could be Shibarium. The Shiba Inu community is currently eagerly anticipating its launch. Shibarium is a layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu that targets Ethereum’s high transaction cost and low transaction speed problem. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Welcomes 10,000 New Holders, Can SHIB Keep Up The Momentum? The goal of the layer-2 blockchain is to lay the groundwork for building the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which will consist of a metaverse, a DEX, and blockchain games. Shibarium has been in development for quite some time. Another developer, Trophias, put the brakes on the release recently. He said that Shibarium needs more time because the launch has to be done carefully. On the other hand, the SHIB community speculates that the announcement could be a new partnership with another blockchain company. However, there are no conclusive indications as to who the company could be. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Caught In Downtrend A new boost for the Shiba Inu price would be a welcoming gift for investors in the meme coin. Since the beginning of the bear market, SHIB has lost about 90% of its value. The all-time high was $0.00008819 and was reached on October 28, 2021. The deep fall of Shiba Inu also happened despite the fact that the token enjoys very high popularity. As Binance made public on December 19, SHIB is one of the top 3 most watched crypto assets on the exchange in 2022, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum. Related Reading: Institutional Crypto Predictions For 2023: Ethereum, BTC, L2s, NFTs However, even the recent announcement of the Shiba Inu lead developer has not been able to move the price. Within the last 24 hours, SHIB is posting a marginal gain of 0.04%, and over the last seven days, a loss of 1.1%. The trading volume is down to $59 million in the last 24 hours, an 8% drop from the previous day. A look at the 4-hour chart of SHIB reveals that the token has been stagnating in a sideways trend since mid-November, trending slightly lower. Just last week, SHIB marked a 6-month low at $0.00000794. The 1-week chart also paints a dark picture and reveals the massive crash in the Shiba Inu price.

6501218,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566505-gold-versus-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1672141507,Gold Versus Crypto,"Summary This article details the advantages of investing in gold versus cryptocurrencies. Factors looked at include supply and demand, sentiment, hype, uses, volatility, energy, safety, hedging, and creation. One is clearly superior as an investment or hedge. You just can’t get this look with cryptocurrency. But, perhaps even better with an NFT? Gold is the original speculative asset but is also the original currency and currency hedge. In recent years people have been substituting cryptocurrencies for gold for all of those purposes. They have been on a wild ride to say the least. Crypto investors tend to be younger and believe it's different this time as cryptocurrencies truly are better as a currency and investment than gold. Gold investors tend to be older and like the stability and long track record of gold. “Gold is money. Everything else is credit.” – JPMorgan “I want Bitcoin to go down a lot further so I can buy some more…If you have gold, you're dumb as f***.” Mark Cuban 12/19/22 “The Golden Rule: He who has the gold makes the rules.” – Attributed to a 1967 Wizard of Id comic strip This article will compare the advantages of gold to the advantages of cryptocurrencies. My readers know I like lists so below are lists of reasons to own cryptos instead of gold and to then reason to own gold over cryptos. Benefits of Cryptocurrencies More trendy – Crypto is part of the culture of younger investors. It is also pushed by many more influencers such as Elon Musk, Matt Damon, Tom Brady, and Mark Cuban. Bigger infrastructure – There is a much bigger infrastructure of parties that push crypto investing than gold. These include dealers, miners, mining equipment manufacturers, traders, token issuers, software companies and influencers who use it to gain followers. No storage fees – Physical gold has to be stored and often insured. Easier to create – Tokens can be created from thin air versus gold which is increasingly difficult to find and intensive to mine. Of course, economics dictate that more supply means lower prices. Alternative to weak fiat currencies – Although cryptos are volatile, they are actually less volatile than some national currencies which face hyper inflation. Gold mining yield – If you own a gold mining stock, even if the price of gold goes up you can lose if the miner has trouble finding enough gold to be profitable. Reasons to choose Gold over Cryptocurrencies Industrial Uses - Gold has numerous industrial uses. It is used heavily in printed circuits, computer chips and transistors. In fact, I invested in a company that recovers gold from used computer and phone parts. Crypto has no physical use. Consumer uses - Gold is heavily used by consumers. Its largest use is for jewelry. Some large societies such as India use jewelry both for fashion and a store of wealth. Crypto again has no physical uses. Monetary uses – Gold is accumulated by governments as a backstop for their currencies. Gold holdings strengthen their currencies. Only one government (El Salvador) is currently trying to do this with almost no success so far. Safer than crypto - Gold is safer than cryptos. There is no key to lose. There are no losses due to hacking. Gold brokerages are safer - Accounts are not currently being lost in bankruptcy such as is currently happening with FTX. There isn’t a wave of dealers and traders going under like there is currently with cryptos. Less volatile – The price of gold does not jump around anywhere near what cryptos have. In the past 3 years alone, the value of cryptos have dropped 40% three times and by over 65% twice. Less manipulated – There are thousands of cryptocurrencies. Many of the smaller ones are easily manipulated by their sponsors. FTX it turns out did this with two cryptocurrencies. Environmentally safer – Mining gold consumes a significant amount of energy. But it pales in comparison to mining cryptos. In fact, crypto mining currently consumes 0.9% to 1.7% of total U.S. electricity usage . This range of electricity usage is similar to all home computers or residential lighting in the United States. There is way less pollution to the environment. Lower energy prices – So you think global warming is a hoax? Then consider the massive energy consumed in mining for cryptos drives up energy prices. Dividends - You can own gold miners and get market rate dividends. There of course are crypto miners too, but few are paying dividends right now, let alone making profits. Also, gold mining stocks are less volatile than crypto mining stocks. Less new supply – The first thing they teach you in any economics class is pricing is a function of supply and demand. The supply of cryptos is skyrocketing. There are over 20,000 different cryptocurrencies with thousands more getting added annually. The amount of tokens for each of these cryptos is also increasing rapidly as it is much easier to mine cryptos than gold. Meanwhile, there is only about 2% of new supply for gold pulled out of the ground each year. Gold is hard to mine. It has been mined for thousands of years and the easy stuff has been found. But the demand for gold increases by more than 2% a year, giving it a guaranteed built in inflation. Age of sobriety – Don’t knock this one as it may be the most important right now. Let’s assume cryptos are not in a bubble. After an era of massive speculative activity, the economy usually has a recession followed by an age of sobriety. This happened in 1929 after the Roaring 20s, again in 2001 after the dot.com crash and in real estate markets starting in 2007. This time a number of bubbles have burst. These include hypergrowth stocks, IPOs, SPACs, meme stocks, option trading and NFTs. Investors have been burned badly and will be less likely to pursue riskier investment for quite a while. These are often the same younger investors as those buying cryptos. That bodes poorly for cryptos. Markets are regulated – Gold is part of the mainstream investment world which is heavily regulated. There is famously little regulation with cryptos and it has been a wild west of hacking, fly-by-night dealers, scams, hype and false advertising. Refund or cancellation policy for errors – Gold dealers are established and have refund or cancellation policies for errors. They have been around a while. FTX is an example of a crypto dealer that had few policies for anything. Proven long haul - Gold has proven to increase in value over the long haul, over 5,000 years. There have been many substitutes promoted over the years but none have to this point rivaled gold as a store of value outside of National currencies and real estate. Inflation protection – Cryptos not only provided no inflation protection the first time out, they actually declined significantly in value when it flared up. Gold has over the long term provided inflation protection. However, it was only flat in value as inflation raged over the past two years. This is probably mostly due to a surge in the dollar. It did provide strong inflation protection for most of the rest of the world over that period. Credibility - Dogecoin issued as a joke has become one of the most valuable cryptos. Value not based on anything rational other than what one person unaffiliated with the coin (Elon Musk) says and does. It is propelled strictly by hype and sentiment. The fact it has actually outperformed Bitcoin and Ether, the two largest cryptos, doesn’t help credibility for the category. Only one – There are over 20,000 cryptocurrencies making it a nightmare to track and know which ones are legit. There is only one gold. Takeaway Cryptocurrencies have not impacted gold is much as you would think. The rise and fall of crypto should have had an inverse reaction for gold, and it really didn’t. Gold was much more impacted the past two years in the U.S. by the strength of the U.S. dollar. There is clearly a lot of passion and a dedicated base for both gold and crypto. Gold at this point is still superior to cryptocurrencies for most functions such as a store of value, and a hedge against inflation or a weak economy. It also has numerous physical uses that cryptos don’t, such as jewelry and in modern electronics. The crypto market like many large newer markets is volatile, speculative, riskier and more vulnerable to manipulation and hacking. Crypto, in my opinion, is too volatile for anyone over 40 saving for retirement. It may eventually move past this but that will take much more regulation and standards. Both gold and cryptos can be used short term by traders using technical analysis. But I do not recommend putting a significant portion of your portfolio in any speculative activity. While the value of gold moves with global economic conditions, jewelry use, commercial use, hedging use, inflation and national economic policies, cryptos move primarily through sentiment and hype. This has been proven the past three years as cryptos surged as other speculative activity surged and fell rapidly as those speculative bubbles burst. Prices for both are impacted by supply and demand but gold supply only increases about 2% a year, while crypto supply is skyrocketing. I am not predicting the cryptocurrency category will go away anytime soon, though many of the smaller ones probably will. There are too many entrenched interested parties. But cryptos have too many issues for most investors. It’s currently based on hype and marketing, and there has been more marketing than ever recently. There has always been a lot of hype around gold too, but it has so many advantages over crypto. Despite its issues gold has proven itself over the long haul. Investments If you want to own gold, there are three primary ways; physical gold, a gold ETF such as GLD, and owning the miners. I recommend an ETF of the miners such as GDX or GDXJ (the junior miners). These are more leveraged to the price of gold than GLD and pay a dividend. By leveraged I mean they move more than gold when gold prices change. They also significantly reduce poor mining results risk by diversifying among a number of companies. For a speculative cryptos play consider the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) which has been trading at around a 50% discount to its bitcoin holdings recently. It is also much more liquid than holding the cryptos themselves and limited to the largest cryptocurrency.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4566505-gold-versus-crypto?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/6501218.jpeg

6498970,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513796,1672138835,"Institutional Crypto Predictions For 2023: Ethereum, BTC, L2s, NFTs","No less than three renowned crypto institutions have recently given their predictions for the coming year 2023 – and there seems to be one favorite: Ethereum. Other main themes for Coinbase, Darma Capital, and Cumberland include the migration of investors to quality projects, the burgeoning innovation from creative destruction, and some fundamental reforms for the crypto industry as a whole. The largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, estimates that crypto markets will not yet decouple from traditional financial markets in early 2023, with investors focusing on quality projects with sustainable tokenomics and mature ecosystems with liquidity. Coinbase Predicts Ethereum Ecosystem To Flourish Coinbase also predicts that the market for layer-1 competitors to Ethereum is oversaturated and that the coming year could be the year of layer-2 blockchains. Thus, Ethereum’s competitors will have a tough time, according to Coinbase. While ETH and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) will hold up well, TVL will migrate to layer 2 solutions such as Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum. Coinbase also predicts another boom for NFTs, which will see an evolution to integration with personalized IDs, ticketing, subscriptions, real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, and supply chain logistics. In addition, more companies will integrate NFTs for brand building and customer engagement. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Downtrend Intact for this Reason, Market Muted As a result of human error in the demise of FTX and other projects in 2022, the American exchange expects regulatory clarity to be critical to the next cycle. Perhaps surprisingly, to some, Coinbase also says institutional lending will sprout and flourish in 2023 with improved due diligence processes – once the bottom is reached. As for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, Coinbase predicts that Mt Gox distribution will not be the big event in 2023, as some analysts claim. Those who wanted to sell have already sold. Moreover, the distributions will be staggered. With regards to Ethereum, Coinbase shares a bullish outlook due to the Merge. ETH is able to be more efficient as a result of the move to proof of stake and is also deflationary. Moreover, the U.S. exchange predicts that the amount of liquid ETH will continue to decline once withdrawals from the deposit contract are possible after the Shanghai hard fork. Darma Capital Predicts ETH To Outperform Bitcoin Just like Coinbase, Darma Capital views the Ethereum Merge as a key development that will have a positive impact on the ETH price. The same goes for the Shanghai hard fork, which will lead to increased ETH staking. On a technical level, Darma sees proto-danksharding as a game-changer for ETH, while it expects innovations from Lido Finance and Obol Network. Fundamentally, Darma predicts that L2s will be key to adoption by the next wave of consumer-facing applications, mentioning Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable. “Vaporwave Chains” like EOS and Cardano will die out as they lose mainstream interest due to lack of on-chain adoption, Darma says. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Keeps Fighting Near $17K, What Could Spark Upside Break The forecast for Bitcoin is not rosy either. According to the institution, BTC will lose market share to altcoins while Ethereum will accomplish the “flippening.” Responsible for this, according to Darma Capital, could be a lack of utility, ESG concerns, and a “failure as a digital gold.” In general, the digital asset risk management advisor expects that the macroeconomic situation will result in a freeze on interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve until the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, the crypto market will see another bull run in Q3 2023. Three Emerging Narratives Cumberland DRW LLC expects challenging market conditions and clear regulatory frameworks in 2023 that will lead to innovative solutions. With this in mind, retail investors will focus on exchanges that can score with transparency, spot trading without prefunding, ISDAs & CSAs, the institution says. As three emerging narratives, the company identifies Bitcoin and Ethereum as reserve currencies, NFTs for IP tokenization, loyalty programs, and customer engagement, specifically citing MATIC, LOOKS, XMON, and GameFi.

Tether’s transaction volume has significantly slipped by 200 billion from 2021 to 2022. USDT falters in the social media department or visibility, which could account for its steady decline. Its social engagements have dropped tremendously by as much as 24.2%, and social mentions have dipped by 13.7% since November. In comparison, other stablecoins have been actively engaged on social media, padding their popularity. USDT has had prevailing negative sentiment since early December, but it has improved, and the weighted sentiment is now looking a little positive. Source: Dune Analytics The value of transactions is another region in which the stablecoin has been supplanted. Dune Analytics found that USDC has outperformed its competitor in this area as well. As of this writing, the total value of all USDT transactions was $710 million, whereas all USDC transactions were worth $4.4 billion. Source: Santiment Despite some good news regarding positive sentiment and market cap, USDT is faltering in terms of network growth, especially in the Optimism, Polygon, and Ethereum networks which signals a decrease in the transfer of USDT happening in the networks.
