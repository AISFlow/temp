42402629,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpej,1551397503,Signature Bank to Offer Accounts to Bermuda's Crypto Startups,"Signature Bank of New York will soon offer full banking services to financial technology firms in Bermuda, including crypto startups that have struggled to secure accounts.  In a press release Thursday night, the government of Bermuda announced that Signature would offer U.S. banking services to licensed fintech firms, including 66 startups already incorporated in the country.  When reached by CoinDesk, a spokesperson for Signature Bank confirmed that it would be providing these services.  Companies can apply for services effective immediately, the Bermudan government said.  Premier David Burt said in a statement that the island's government had been working to ""promote Bermuda as the destination of choice for FinTech companies looking for a place to domicile.""  Where others fear to tread  Banks have traditionally been ""reluctant"" to provide banking services for companies dealing with digital assets, he noted, explaining that there are concerns about running afoul of international regulations. He went on to say:  ""Signature Bank’s willingness to consider Bermuda licensed businesses for banking services is a significant vote of confidence in and endorsement of Bermuda’s efforts to create a leading high standard regulatory regime for FinTech business.""  Signature Bank vice chairman John Tamberlane said in a statement that the company was ""impressed"" by Bermuda's regulatory framework, and was looking forward to working ""with the Government of Bermuda to help promote growth and expansion of the FinTech and digital asset industry in that country.""  Separately, the bank's CEO and president, Joseph DePaolo, highlighted his organization's work with Signet, its internal blockchain payment system.  ""Signature Bank is one of the few banks in the U.S. that will provide deposit accounts and corporate debit cards to cryptocurrency startups but we are seeing non-crypto businesses signing up as well,"" he said.

42402643,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpna,1551391207,Kraken Exchange Offers $100K Reward for Missing QuadrigaCX Crypto,"Crypto exchange Kraken is offering up to $100,000 to anyone who can help solve this year's biggest blockchain mystery: what happened to QuadrigaCX's coins?  Kraken announced  Thursday it would pay the reward to users who could help it locate the missing funds. Any tips sent to the platform will, in turn, be shared with law enforcement, the company said in a blog post. The reward is payable in fiat or cryptocurrency.  To participate, Kraken is encouraging users to listen to a pair of podcasts that outline both what is already known about QuadrigaCX, the Canadian crypto exchange that collapsed last month, as well as what Kraken's operators believe happened.  ""Kraken is giving up to $100,000 USD (fiat or crypto) as a reward for the tip(s) that best lead to the discovery of the missing $190 million US dollars,"" Kraken's post said.  In fact, according to court filings QuadrigaCX owes roughly 115,000 customers about $137 million in cryptocurrencies and another $53 million in fiat, or $190 million overall (though later filings indicate that there may be additional funds owed, bringing the total as high as $196 million).  The story so far  QuadrigaCX sought protection from creditors following the death of its founder, Gerald Cotten. In court filings, Cotten's widow, Jennifer Robertsen, said that he was the only individual at the exchange who knew the private keys to its crypto reserves, which were held in cold storage.  Further, while the exchange indicated that the majority of its crypto funds were held in cold storage, it has so far not released any wallet addresses to confirm this.  A cluster of five bitcoin addresses  may be associated with Quadriga, according to blockchain analysis, but those addresses only contain roughly 104 bitcoin ""inadvertently"" sent to cold storage earlier this month.  So far, Quadriga and its court-appointed monitor, Ernst & Young (EY), have unlocked a large chunk of the fiat funds, which were held by various third-party payment processors, after a hearing before the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, which is overseeing the exchange's case.

42402641,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpmb,1551389425,Bittrex Leads $1.5 Million Round for South African Crypto Exchange VALR,"Global crypto exchange Bittrex led a $1.5 million seed round in South African trading platform VALR.  Bittrex CEO Bill Shihara told CoinDesk the South African market has “tremendous untapped potential.” Fellow VALR investor Michael Jordaan of Montegray Capital told CoinDesk that VALR’s support for 50 cryptocurrencies will offer the most diverse range of assets of any African exchange when it opens to the public on March 1.  “The VALR team has the potential to change the cryptocurrency landscape in South Africa and globally,"" Jordaan said.  VALR co-founder and CEO Farzam Ehsani told CoinDesk that 1,500 users, predominantly South Africans, have already signed up on the exchange’s waiting list and started activating accounts in a closed beta leading up the to launch.  Ehsani said a backend partnership with Bittrex will offer the new exchange global liquidity and competitive prices for crypto-to-crypto trading, while his team works on activating fiat on-ramps with South African banks by summertime.  Ehsani told CoinDesk:  “Companies are not allowed to go and buy [large amounts of] crypto from offshore markets. This makes it very difficult for crypto exchanges in South Africa to access liquidity from international markets. [South Africans] want their hands on a store of value that doesn’t depreciate the way the rand has.”  Over the past decade the South African rand has nearly halved in value. Meanwhile, capital controls restrict citizens from transacting across borders with more than roughly $72,000 worth of foreign assets or currencies.  This contributes to why bitcoin is often sold for a high premium on peer-to-peer exchanges like LocalBitcoins. For comparison, on Tuesday a single bitcoin on LocalBitcoins would have cost more than $4,100 in South Africa compared to the global rate of roughly $3,800.  Yet Marius Reitz, South Africa manager at the longstanding African bitcoin exchange and wallet provider Luno, told CoinDesk that Luno’s user base grew to over 2 million user accounts by early 2019.  “Most of the growth is driven by South Africa,” Reitz said. In fact, a Luno survey of 1,000 local residents found that roughly 167 people said they use bitcoin for payments.  “Specifically in South Africa we see a situation were a lot of people move from elsewhere in Africa to look for jobs and they send money back home,” Reitz said.  As for VALR, Jordaan said Ehsani’s history as the former head of the Rand Merchant Bank’s blockchain initiative and inaugural chair of the South African Financial Blockchain Consortium, which included dozens of traditional financial institutions, could help bridge the gap between African banks and the global crypto economy.  Regional hub  Reitz and Jordaan agreed that cryptocurrency exchanges like VALR and Luno are helping establish standards for the regional market. Plus, the South African Reserve Bank published a paper about prioritizing crypto industry regulation in January. While the daily volumes on incumbents like Luno, established in 2013, still fall shy of $2.5 million according to CoinMarketCap, such companies have a broad impact through their educational conversations about bitcoin with regulators and banks across Africa.  “Because several of the countries around us actually peg their currencies to the rand,” Ehsani said, “if we do well, we have the ability to influence other countries in the region, and Africa as a whole.”  Ehsani added that VALR’s scope reaches beyond South African borders, as the platform’s know-your-customer identity checks accommodate traders from most countries. Similarly, Reitz said Luno is looking to expand to 20 new African countries this year as South Africa’s central bank starts “offering more clarity” and establishes trends followed by other jurisdictions.  Much like global markets, many South African exchange users are speculative traders and investors. However, for Ehsani, remittances to and from members of the African diaspora provide a salient use case because local remittance services are very expensive.  Speaking to the impact that venture capital investment in South African exchanges can have on broader adoption, Ehsani said:  “Cryptocurrency will start bringing communities together through their ability to transact and send value back home much more seamlessly and cheaply than their current options.”  Farzam Ehsani image via VALR",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/02/28/bittrex-leads-15-million-round-for-south-african-crypto-exchange-valr,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c32c9d0d173455678bd43ac8b9ddf558d126370a-1108x707.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402644,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbpoZ,1551384556,Ethereum Upgrades as Hard Forks Activate on Blockchain,"Two long-anticipated upgrades appear to have officially activated on the ethereum blockchain, the world's second-largest by market value, without incident.  At 19:57 (UTC), the sixth and seventh system-wide upgrades to the software, dubbed Constantinople and St. Petersburg, respectively, rolled out on the main network at block number 7,280,000. As seen on blockchain monitoring website Fork Monitor, there is so far no evidence of a chain split that would suggest a portion of ethereum users are still running an older ethereum software.  Past hard forks of the ethereum blockchain have encountered such setbacks, most notably in 2016 with ethereum classic, a group that continued running an older software instance when a controversial upgrade was introduced.  As background, before any system-wide upgrade, or hard fork, miners and node operators are required to install new client software that automatically updates at the exact same block number. This prevents two concurrent and incompatible versions of the same blockchain from splitting the wider network.  With the apparent activation, the St. Petersburg code has also disabled part of the Constantinople code deemed back in January to host security vulnerabilities that could be used by attackers to steal funds.  “With the blockchain, everyone has to upgrade in order for everyone to be able to use [the new] features,” explained Taylor Monahan – CEO of blockchain wallet tool MyCrypto.  “About two weeks before the fork, everyone upgrades the software but none of the new features are enabled,” said Monahan to CoinDesk. “Then, on that block number, everyone at the exact same time starts using the new features. So, that’s how we prevent differing states from existing simultaneously. It’s [also] called a consensus issue or a consensus bug.”  MyCrypto presently runs 10 to 15 computer servers also called nodes all running on the most updated version of the Parity ethereum client.  With today’s release of Constantinople and St. Petersberg, four different ethereum improvement proposals (EIPs) have been officially activated on the ethereum network – one of which does introduce a new “corner case” affecting smart contract immutability.  As of press time, the market price for ether – the main cryptocurrency of the network – has seen a small jump from $135.14 shortly prior to release.

42402635,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdbphg,1551378620,JP Morgan Is Quietly Testing Cutting-Edge Ethereum Privacy Tech,"JPMorgan Chase’s blockchain team is increasing its firepower around a branch of mind-bending math called zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs).  These proofs, which allow someone to prove a statement is true about a set of data without revealing the data itself, are seen as a solution to the privacy issues that have made regulated companies wary of using shared digital ledgers. Previously, JPMorgan did pioneering work in this area with Quorum, its private version of the ethereum blockchain.  Now, the global bank is testing out another zero-knowledge privacy solution called AZTEC. Developed by a London startup of the same name, this protocol aims to allow encryption of blockchain data at a lower cost and more efficiently than previous versions of the technology.  Speaking of the technology, AZTEC CEO Tom Pocock told CoinDesk,  “It’s being tested by the most important bank in blockchain today. JPMorgan Quorum actually.”  A JPMorgan insider confirmed the bank’s Quorum team is looking at AZTEC and is “generally looking to industrialize zero-knowledge proofs for Quorum.”  JPMorgan and AZTEC would make an odd couple. To date, the bank has strictly limited its blockchain work to permissioned, or gated, systems. Even JPM Coin, the dollar-backed cryptocurrency it plans to launch, will run on Quorum and be available only to vetted institutional clients.  AZTEC, by contrast, sets out to bridge the gap between the public and private blockchain realms.  Pocock said AZTEC, which is exploring faster and more efficient forms of blockchain data encryption, wants the best of best of both worlds.  “AZTEC allows you to take what would normally be restricted to a private blockchain and to issue those assets, trade and clear them on a public blockchain, with all of the additional execution guarantees,” he said.  Public/private bridge  The AZTEC protocol is well known within the public ethereum community, where tests have been done to convert the Maker DAI stablecoin into a confidential form.  Dr. Zac Williamson, AZTEC's CTO, explained that AZTEC uses a different approach to privacy than Quorum; the latter combines its own Constellation privacy system with zero-knowledge proofs.  “[Quorum] uses kind of permissioning to create a level of privacy,” noted Williamson, “We are public, so how do you do transactions when there is no special overseer or individual institution which has privileged access to data?”  To make this work in an efficient manner, AZTEC uses a special type of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) called range proofs that go easier on computational power than classical ZKPs, and these are combined with other types of cryptographic commitment schemes.  The system also differs from other privacy solutions on ethereum as values are represented much more like bitcoin’s unspent transaction output (UTXO) model, where inputs on a blockchain are deleted when a transaction occurs, whilst at the same time new outputs, or UTXOs, are created.  Using the AZTEC system, “the user sends a ZKP [proving] that the sum of the input notes is equal to the sum of the output notes,” said Williamson. “Once you know that, then you don't need to know what's inside each individual note. You know that the transaction is mathematically legitimate and there isn't double spending going on.”  In terms of usability and performance, the AZTEC system allows for much lower transaction processing costs on ethereum than ZKPs currently do, the startup says. As for throughput, for the time being, AZTEC runs at about a tenth of ethereum’s 10-30 transactions per second, but this is set to improve with the next hard fork, said Williamson.  However, he pointed to use cases like syndicated loans with which his team has been conducting experiments, adding that, for now, the focus is not so much on scaling, but rather as a way of making ethereum work as a private settlement system.  Bridging the gap where legally or contractually it’s not possible to put data on a public blockchain is AZTEC’s aim, said Williamson, concluding,  “Then a lot of the reasons a private blockchain was really necessary go away.”  JPMorgan  image via Shutterstock.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MKR | FORKS,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/02/28/jp-morgan-is-quietly-testing-cutting-edge-ethereum-privacy-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4939b92e52d91d376bbbec7edaf4bb734b1559a8-1500x988.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Revealed at the Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona this week, the XPhone will let users switch between a traditional mode that supports Android apps and a ""blockchain mode,"" which will grant users access to decentralized apps (dapps) loaded on the device.  Customers will be able to make the switch with the push of a button, a blog post by Pundi X explained, adding that this feature is made possible by loading both an Android 9.0 operating system (OS) as well as Pundi's Android-based Function X OS.  ""Blockchain-based calling and messaging can be toggled on and off on the phone operating system, which builds upon Android 9.0,"" Pundi X said Monday.  First announced last year, the XPhone also claims to support carrier-free calling through its peer-to-peer network. The startup demonstrated that feature at the time.  Though a working prototype was demonstrated in October, Pundi X's most recent blog post explained that the specifications have been upgraded, aiming to launch with a mid-range processor, 6 gigabytes of RAM and a number of other features. (A note on the specifications list states that its design is still subject to change).  At launch, the phone will retail for $599, meaning it is cheaper than other blockchain phones like the HTC EXODUS 1, the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Sirin Labs Finney. However, according to the device's website, only 5,000 XPhones will be built. The company is currently targeting ""late 2019"" for release, though a specific date has not been announced.  Pundi X's demonstration is only the latest blockchain-related announcement at Mobile World Congress this week, following HTC, Samsung and Electroneum, which unveiled a crypto-mining smartphone this week – though that was a low-cost device targeting developing countries.

He continued to say ""the innovation is there and it must be used in the agricultural world,"" as doing so would both bring ""shared excellence"" and offer benefits to consumers.  The call for innovation came as part of a multi-part strategy that the president outlined in his speech. Europe's agricultural policy going forward, he said, would be based on the protection of farmers and consumers against climate change and market risks, farming more ecologically, and using technology and innovation to help to solve industry challenges.  If there is support from the EU member nations, Macron also said he would propose the establishment of a European task force to ensure the standards of agricultural products and fight food fraud.

According to an article in The Japan Times on Thursday, the National Police Agency (NPA) has released data indicating that cryptocurrency exchanges reported 7,096 cases of suspicious transactions in 2018.  That figure is a hefty 961 percent greater than the previously reported number of 669 cases for the shorter period of April to December 2017. It is also almost 20 percent higher than the reported figure of 5,944 cases in the first 10 months of 2018.  Out of the 7,096 suspected cases last year, some exchanges cited the use of cryptocurrency in illegal activities such as the drugs trade, while others used different names and birth dates had identical ID photos, or logged into accounts from overseas locations despite having addresses in Japan, Thursday's report indicates.  Japan passed a law in April 2017 that recognizes bitcoin as a legal payment method, while mandating cryptocurrency exchanges to be licensed and the reporting of transactions suspected to be part of money laundering and drug trafficking.  It's worth noting, though, that despite the sharp rise in reports, cryptocurrency transactions only made up 1.7 percent of the total of reported suspicious transactions when fiat currency was included.  The NPA said it had received 417,465 reports of suspected money laundering and other illicit financial transactions last year. Most, it said, involved banks and other financial institutions.

42402617,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblQ2,1551358807,Crypto Broker Voyager Is Buying Token Issuer and Wallet Ethos.io for $4 Million,"Voyager, a crypto brokerage platform that launched and went public this month, has agreed to buy wallet startup Ethos.io for about $4 million.  Announced Thursday, the deal would give Voyager a range of products developed by Singapore-based Ethos, including the Ethos Universal Wallet and the blockchain platform Ethos Bedrock, plus ""certain blockchain technology and IP.""  Further, Voyager said it will pick up an allocation of Ethos tokens, which the target company, formerly known as Bitquence, issued through an initial coin offering (ICO) in July 2017, raising $1.6 million, according to CoinDesk's ICO Tracker database.  Voyager will pay for the acquisition with its listed shares — earlier this month the New York-based startup went public through a reverse merger with a dormant company traded on Canada's TSX Venture Exchange.  The deal will cost Voyager 7 million common shares, the company said, which are now quoted at $0.80 in Canadian dollars, which works out to a total value of $5.6 million CAD, or roughly $4 million in USD.  While the deal is expected to close at the end of March, the price won't all be paid upfront.  The conditions of the deal stipulate that 3.3 million shares will be delivered to Ethos at the start, 1 million will be held in escrow and released monthly over two years (provided that Ethos continues integrating its functionality into the Voyager platform and updating the technology), and the remaining 2.6 million will be held in escrow for 24 months ""against any future indemnity claims.""  As part of the deal, Shingo Lavine, founder and CEO of Ethos, will become Voyager's chief innovation officer and join the company's board, and Ethos' former owners will have the right to nominate one director for appointment to the Voyager board at each annual general meeting, once they have amassed at least 3.5 million shares.  Tokenized business model  Even before the merger agreement, Voyager and Ethos had been working together for some time.  The two startups partnered last October to add a self-custody option for Voyager's users, as well as allowing Ethos users to convert, store and trade cryptocurrencies via Voyager.  After the acquisition, the two developer teams will start working together on the same objectives, Voyager's CEO, Steve Ehrlich, told CoinDesk:  ""Before we had separate priorities, but we liked so much what we started together as strategic partners that we decided to bring our resources together. There is some different expertise at the two developer teams, and now they are working closely together.""  The Ethos token, which was first introduced to the market through an ICO in July 2017, will be a valuable component for Voyager's business, Ehrlich said.  The token was designed to pay for Ethos' wallet services, for example, transaction fees and API calls. But in the future it might be used to pay cash-back rewards for trading on the platform, Ehrlich explained, adding that the token isn't getting listed for trading at Voyager yet, though the joint team is ""having conversations about that right now, but there are regulatory hurdles related to that.""  Among other future use cases for Ethos tokens, users may be able to pledge it as collateral for margin trading accounts and even earn interest on their token holdings, Voyager said.  Another benefit of the deal, according to Ehrlich, is that now Voyager owns and can fully utilize the fintech platform for crypto companies developed by Ethos, Ethos Bedrock, to build a future crypto-payment system.  ""We're starting to become a real end-to-end cryptocurrency solution,"" Ehrlich said. Over the next few years, he said, Voyager aims to become a big player at crypto trading, custody, payment and security, and the acquisition of Ethos will help to do it faster.  Voyager is not disclosing the number of users it managed to attract so far since launching in mid-February, but combining the user bases of the two companies will result in ""hundreds of thousands"" of clients overall, Ehrlich said.  The company was founded in July 2018 to allow trading cryptocurrencies across different exchanges without paying trading fees. The founding team included Uber's co-founder Oscar Salazar and the app's early investor Philip Eytan, as well as Ehrlich, who previously worked as a CEO of retail brokerage Lightspeed Financial and ran the professional trading arm for online stock broker E*Trade.

The news comes via a Bloomberg report on Thursday citing “people familiar with the matter.” This was possibly GIC’s first investment in the crypto space, the sources added.  The fund has more than $100 billion in assets in over 40 countries across various asset classes, the report adds, though the Sovereign Wealth Institute puts the total far higher at an estimated $390 billion.  Crypto exchange Coinbase announced the $300 million Series E equity round last October. At the time, neither the exchange nor GIC disclosed the fund's participation.  The funding was led by Tiger Global Management, while Y Combinator Continuity, Wellington Management, Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain and others also participated. Coinbase said at the time that the raise gave it a “post-money valuation of over $8 billion.”  Large investment funds are increasingly starting to dip their toes in the digital assets space. Just last week, the University of Michigan, which has an endowment valued at about $12 billion, disclosed that it committed $3 million to Andreessen Horowitz’s cryptocurrency fund back in June. The university also said that it is considering further investment in the fund.  Yale University, which boasts second-largest endowment among educational institutions globally, also reportedly invested in Horowitz’s fund at the time, as well as backing Paradigm’s $400 million crypto fund last October.

The cryptocurrency reinforced a bullish triangle breakout witnessed last week with a quick recovery from sub-$3,700 levels yesterday. This “buy the dip” mentality indicates scope for a break above the recent high of $4,190.  The focus would shift to the primary bearish trend seen on the monthly chart if BTC fails to pick a strong bid in the next few days. In that case, the probability of BTC ending March on a negative note for the sixth consecutive year would rise.  Bitcoin is heading into a historically weak month on a positive note and could see gains if resistance at $4,190 is breached.  The leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization has had a tough time in the final month of the first quarter for the last five years. Prices fell 15.7, 4, 4.9, 9.3 and 32 percent in the month of March from 2014 through 2018, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.  This time, however, March may turn out to be a good month, especially if the early signs of bullish reversal seen in February yield quick progress to levels above the crucial resistance of $4,190 in the next week or two.  Further, BTC has posted gains in February in the previous four years and is all set to extend that winning streak to the fifth year with 10 percent gains.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,820, having defended key support of $3,700 yesterday.  Bitcoin has posted gains in February and losses in March for the last four years.  March has proved a weak month six times out of the last eight years.  3-day and daily charts  On the 3-day chart, BTC has bounced up from the ascending 10-candle moving average (MA), reinforcing the bullish view put forward by that MA.  Further, both the MACD (moving average convergence divergence) histogram and the Chaikin money flow (CMF) are printing bullish above zero.  Meanwhile, the daily chart shows the cryptocurrency has defended the former resistance-turned-support of the upper edge of the triangle pattern with a long-tailed doji – a sign of dip demand.  As a result, a re-test of $4,000 could be on the cards. A violation there would expose the next major resistance lined up at $4,190.  Weekly chart  The inverted bullish hammer seen in the weekly chart suggests the bulls are beginning to test the bears’ resolve to keep prices lower – a sign the market is bottoming out.  That said, a bullish reversal would be confirmed only if prices end the current week (Sunday, UTC close) or the next week above the hammer’s high of $4,190.  That would validate the bullish divergence of the MACD and the relative strength index’s (RSI) upside break of the falling trendline and allow a stronger rally toward $4,833 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the sell-off from November highs to December lows).  However, an inability to produce quick gains above $4,190 would shift focus back to the primary bearish trend, as seen on the monthly chart, and would shift risk in favor of a drop to recent lows below $3,400.

Announcing the news on Wednesday, Figure said the round was led by venture capital firms RPM Ventures and partners at DST Global, with Ribbit Capital, DCM Ventures, Digital Currency Group, Nimble Ventures and others also participating.  The Series B investment brings the firm’s total equity funding to over $120 million, the firm said, adding that the new investment will go toward helping the firm strengthen its product offerings.  Founded last year, the firm launched its home equity loan product in October, which utilizes its native blockchain protocol called Provenance. The firm claims to provide loan approval in “as little as five minutes"" and funding within five days.  Figure co-founder and CEO Mike Cagney said that the round “validates” its market potential, adding:  ""We launched the fastest HELOC [home equity line of credit] in the market, and we originate, finance and sell every one of our loans on the Provenance blockchain, an industry first.”  Figure said in its announcement that it turned to blockchain tech for its ""security, efficiencies and cost advantage"" for loan origination, financing and sales.  A number of funds, banks and dealers are already using Provenance, it added. By mid-2019, Figure expects several other loan originators to use the platform by mid-2019. Other use cases, such as putting investment funds on the blockchain, will also be explored this year.  Figure said it has funded more than 1,500 HELOCs for customers across 36 U.S. states since September.

That left the firm with a net profit from bitcoin sales of $1.69 million.  Looking at Square's quarterly figures, the bitcoin business was notably better in the second half of last year.  Specifically, the firm took $95 million in bitcoin revenues in the second half, compared with about $71 million in the first half. Profit for the second half was $1.047 million, and was $643,000 in H1.  The firm further disclosed that the carrying value of bitcoin held by the firm was $200,000 as of Dec. 31, 2018.

42402608,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdblIA,1551330143,Bitcoin Lightning Tech Expands Beyond Invoices in Step Toward Better UX,"Bitcoin's lightning network has taken a big step toward a better user experience courtesy of new work by one of its principal open-source developers.  Widely believed to be the key to helping the cryptocurrency reach a mainstream audience by pushing it to handle millions of transactions, lightning still has a lot of work ahead of it. First and foremost, it's not exactly safe to use yet. No less important is that the user experience has its kinks. Namely, the current way of generating addresses for accepting payments is not as easy or dynamic as it could be for many use cases.  But that is starting to change. Lightning Labs CTO Olaoluwa Osuntokun recently released a rough draft of a code change that would allow users to accept an address that doesn’t need to change each time. It's a proof of concept, showing that payments can be made with a static address.  ""When you do a payment, you request an invoice, that works well for some cases. But sometimes you might want to send to just a node – interaction from the receiver or not,"" as Osuntokun put it in conversation with CoinDesk.  He added:  ""I think it's a really cool feature. Alice can send to Bob without Bob expecting it or having to do anything at all. Which is cool because it removes some friction.""  He added it might be good for games or tips, where people don't necessarily need all the details an invoice provides, like who sent them money and for what item.  It's been a much-requested feature since lightning, still in beta, was launched. Lightning K0ala, the pseudonymous developer who created lightning's first hit game, even argued on Twitter: ""This unlocks a whole set of possibilities for end-user UX.""  “It’s definitely needed,” Bitcoin Core and lightning network contributor Ben Woosley told CoinDesk.  Though, very importantly, it’s not a perfect code implementation — not by far. Plus, the usual warnings about using bitcoin’s lightning network while it’s still early-stage definitely still apply.  'Spontaneous payments'  Right now in lightning, users and merchants accept payments via invoices.  Say a user wants a cup of coffee. The barista will generate an invoice saying a user owes them $3 worth of bitcoin. The invoice is fulfilled when the sender submits the correct amount.  Similar to bitcoin addresses, it's a jumbled string of letters and numbers. This tweet from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey might be the most widely seen example so far.  The main drawback to this method is an invoice can only be used once. If a user were to accept a second payment to the address, the payment could be stolen.  This works for a lot of commercial applications until it doesn't. Some users want another option: to just slap an address somewhere, maybe to pull in donations. People often use bitcoin addresses in this way. People just post an address somewhere that multiple people can send donations to – a user might get 20 donations from people from across the world.  So, it's no surprise that other developers have already thought a lot about how to implement this feature. Lightning developer René Pickhardt even ""hacked"" the lightning software to allow users to do so, releasing code for others who would want to do the same.  ""That allows [users] to do spontaneous payments with the current implementations without the necessity for others to upgrade their nodes,"" he told CoinDesk.  But with Osuntokun's Sphinx send, spontaneous payments get a more formal – not accidental – introduction. With the change to LND, it adds an option for receiving payments.  ""You just need the public key of the receiver,"" he told CoinDesk, which doesn't need to change each time the way an invoice does.  People call the new feature “spontaneous payments” because the recipient of a payment doesn’t have to approve that they’re getting a payment ahead of time, as is done with an invoice.  A 'hacky' start  While the code works, Osuntokun admits it's ""hacky"" so far.  ""Much of this [code] will likely change,"" he said in the pull request introducing what he called a ""rough draft"" of the new feature. The next steps are pretty nitty gritty. Osuntokun told CoinDesk he's next working on ""finalizing"" the software's ""extra blob format"" (EOB), a change that would allow users to send more data attached to payments over the network.  In addition to Sphinx send, the code change will lay the foundations for future much-anticipated code changes, including Atomic Multi-Path Payments (AMP), a way to combine many lightning channels into one.  But even if it's not ready for prime-time yet, Osuntokun is excited to see the lightning community start exploring it as an option. He and other developers think this could open up a range of new use cases, including donations and easier exchanges from one cryptocurrency to another.  As he said in the proposal:  ""This allows users to start exploring a new set of use cases that benefits from this type of spontaneous payment.""
