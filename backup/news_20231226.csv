Gox, the infamous Bitcoin exchange that suffered a major hack over a decade ago, has allegedly finally begun the process of repaying its customers for the 850,000 lost Bitcoin. This news has sent shockwaves through the market, causing a momentary disruption in the Bitcoin price uptrend. As a result of these developments, the current price of Bitcoin stands at $42,625, with a 24-hour trading volume of $22,655,498,534.64. However, the market has witnessed a -2.40% decline in the past 24 hours, reflecting the uncertainty caused by the Mt. Gox repayment proceedings. Bitcoin Price Plunges Amidst Mounting Speculation Reports from participants in the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit group indicate that some individuals have already received payouts in yen via PayPal. However, those who opted for cash deposits into their bank accounts have not reported any inflows as of yet. Several users have shared notifications they received, alerting them to a system error that resulted in double payments. These users are now allegedly being requested to return the excess funds to the Rehabilitation Trustee promptly. Moreover, the Rehabilitation Trustee has reached out to affected individuals to refund the mistakenly transferred amount, which was the second transfer, as the first transfer was the official repayment. Related Reading: Ethereum: Balancing Act At $2,300 – Scaling The Heights Or Facing A Looming Drop? Users have been instructed to use PayPal’s “Refund” feature to return the funds to the Rehabilitation Trustee’s account. Alternatively, they can transfer an equivalent amount of money to the Rehabilitation Trustee’s PayPal account if the “Refund” feature is unavailable. While some users have confirmed receiving their repayments, there is uncertainty surrounding the timing of Bitcoin reimbursements or if they are taking effect. No Bitcoin Outflows Detected From Mt. Gox? In a recent statement by CryptoQuant co-founder and CEO, Ki Young Ju, it has been confirmed that “no Bitcoin outflows have been recorded from the Mt. Gox Trustee wallet at this time.” Furthermore, the trustee responsible for managing the rehabilitation proceedings of Mt. Gox, the now-defunct Bitcoin exchange, has yet to provide any official statements explaining the absence of outflows from the wallet. Consequently, the cryptocurrency community finds itself on edge, eagerly awaiting updates regarding the timing and method of Bitcoin reimbursements.

According to James Butterfill, Head of Research at CoinShares, digital assets saw a net inflow of $103 million last week, as the wider crypto industry went through a few days of bullish sentiment. This is particularly exciting, as it signaled a change from the net outflows in digital asset investment funds witnessed two weeks ago. Crypto Fund Inflows Surge To $103 Million Crypto asset investment funds witnessed a minor net outflow of $16 million two weeks ago, bringing an end to 11 consecutive weeks of inflows since September. However, according to a social media post by Butterfill, these investment funds attracted a $103 million net inflow last week. As expected, Bitcoin, again, led the charge, attracting 85% of the total inflow. Bitcoin saw an inflow of $87 million last week, bringing its total net inflow this year to $1.758 billion.

At the time of writing, Solana’s total inflow this year stands at $162 million, reflecting the better sentiment Solana has seen with institutional investors this year. On the other hand, Litecoin and Avalanche investment products were the only ones registering a net outflow during the week, with $0.4 million and $2.6 million respectively. In terms of geographical location, Germany had the most inflows with $41.6 million, Canada with $25.8 million, USA with $20.4 million, and Switzerland with $15 million. On the other hand, Sweden had a net outflow of $8.7 million. Total assets under management now stand at $52 billion, representing 31% of the entire crypto market cap of $1.65 trillion. Most of this is traded in the United States, with US-based investment funds holding $37.8 billion worth of assets under management. US$103m inflows in digital assets last week, no report on Monday.

21789554,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=567019,1703622638,2023’s Crypto Bounty: These Top 13 Airdrops Distributed Over $4 Billion,"023 has emerged as a significant year for crypto airdrops. A recent analysis revealed that out of the 50 most substantial crypto airdrops since 2020, 13 occurred in 2023, collectively distributing roughly $4.56 billion worth of tokens. These figures are calculated based on the tokens’ values at their respective all-time highs (ATHs), painting a picture of substantial distribution. The year 2023’s airdrop landscape was less crowded than 2021, which had 18 entries in the top 50, but the impact was notable. A report from CoinGecko highlights this trend shift, contrasting it with the mere 5 airdrops in 2020 and 14 in 2022. Related Reading: Arbitrum Network Faces Major Outage, ARB Token Faces 4% Decline Arbitrum Leads 2023’s Airdrop Charge Arbitrum, an Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution, topped the 2023 airdrop chart by distributing ARB tokens valued at $1.96 billion on March 23. This move significantly impacted its total value locked (TVL), which surged by 147% during the anticipation period. This airdrop alone constituted a substantial portion of the total value distributed in the year. Celestia, with its TIA tokens, followed suit, distributing $728 million on October 31. The airdrop targeted a diverse group, including developers, Ethereum rollup users, and stakeholders in the Cosmos Hub and Osmosis. Blur’s first airdrop, which handed out $446 million worth of BLUR on February 14, ranked third. The success of this initial airdrop set the stage for a second, which distributed an additional $327 million, ranking fourth. A Closer Look At 2023’s Crypto Airdrop Trends While Arbitrum, Celestia, and Blur’s first airdrop made up 69.9% of the total airdrop value in 2023, the year saw diverse contributions across the sector. Jito, Worldcoin, Aidoge, and other projects followed, each adding to the cumulative value and diversity of the airdrops. The total value distributed in 2023 may have seen a decline compared to 2022, but it’s essential to consider the market cycles these newer tokens have experienced. Unlike earlier tokens which saw the 2021 bull market and the 2022 non-fungible token (NFT) market surge, many of 2023’s airdropped tokens are yet to undergo a full bull market cycle.

Celestia and Blur follow closely in terms of price appreciation, with both tokens up by 10.7% and 5.7% respectively in the past 7 days. Conversely, Jito, despite being the newest among them, has seen a dip in its value down by 9.4% in the past two weeks but shows signs of recovery in the past week, up by 9%, illustrating the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of token valuations post-airdrop.

In the coming week, we’ll be unpacking 2023, its downs and ups, to reveal what the next months could bring for crypto and DeFi investors. Related Reading: A Crypto Christmas Special With Jlabs Digital: Past, Present, And Future Like last year, we paid homage to Charles Dicke’s classic “A Christmas Carol” and gathered a group of experts to discuss the crypto market’s past, present, and future. In that way, our readers might discover clues that will allow them to transverse 2024 and its potential trends. Crypto Christmas: A Deep Look Into The Bull Market And A Secret Pattern Once again, the crypto analytics firm Material Indicators joined us to discuss the current market structure. This year, we spoke with Keith Alan, one of the co-founders and analysts at the firm. Alan gave us his perspective on the bull market or what looks like the beginning of a bullish trend. Material Indicators is well known for their reliance on hard data, and for sharing views that often questioned the general beliefs in the crypto market. This time was no difference as Alan pointed to the evidence favoring both sides, bulls and bears. This is what he told us. Q: In light of the prolonged bearish trends observed in 2022 and 2023, how do these periods compare to previous downturns in severity and impact? With Bitcoin now crossing the $40,000 threshold, does this signify a conclusive end to the bear market, or are there potential market twists investors should brace for? MI: Nobody could argue that 2022 was anything but a bear market. After Bitcoin reached an ATH in November of 2021 we saw the bear market develop in classic fashion by losing support at key technical levels. While the bear was playing out in somewhat predictable fashion, the market was caught off guard by the events that led to the FTX crash in November 2022. Because the contagion from FTX had a devastating ripple effect that was felt by the largest institutions with crypto exposure as well as banks, I actually expected prices to fall even lower. At the time, fear and fighting among institutional players like Galaxy, Gemini and Grayscale (under DCG) who were among SBF’s largest institutional victims added to the concern that price would grind down towards the lower teens, yet somewhat remarkably and perhaps not so coincidentally on January 1, 2023 Bitcoin started to rally. What was first considered weekend whale games evolved long past the weekend, and in fact, through Q1/2023 I identified an entity on FireCharts which I nicknamed “Notorious B.I.D.” that was double stacking large blocks of bid liquidity to push price higher. There was a pattern to the behavior that made it somewhat predictable and tradable. Those moves were well documented in my X feed during that period of time. Once price reached $25k that entity disappeared. Even without the help of that manipulation pushing price up, and despite the fact that the macroeconomic situation was horrible, the geopolitical situation went from bad to worse and the US political situation evolved from a dysfunctional sh*t show to a full blown circus, the market continued to rally. Now, nearly 12 months and > 150% from the day the rally began, the debate between bulls and bears over whether this is a confirmed bull market or a sequence of bear market distribution rallies literally continues today. While it’s understandable that someone could look at 150% and immediately assume bull market, it does require a deeper understanding of what distribution and accumulation look like. From my view, that still isn’t as clear as one would expect. Historically, the Purple Class of Whales with orders in the $100k – $1M range have had the most influence over BTC price direction. The order flow data I’ve been monitoring on Binance shows that through most of the year they (along with larger MegaWhales) have been buying dips and distributing significantly more than they bought on those dips on the uptrends that followed. Only recently have we seen an uptick that could be an indication that the trend is shifting. Parallel to that, some on-chain data providers are showing an increase in the number of wallets holding BTC which is also an indication that we could be transitioning from a distribution phase to an accumulation phase and I’m looking for more clear evidence of that. One of the things I look for to get a sense of that is bid liquidity. I believe that “Liquidity = Sentiment,” and it’s no secret that order books have been thin on both sides of price through most of the year, however in the last 3 weeks or so, we’ve started seeing more institutional sized bid ladders coming into the order book and that fact supports a bullish thesis, as long as they don’t dump through the next pump. With all of the above in mind, there are most certainly turns and twists that investors should look out for. Sure we are starting to see some improvements on the U.S. inflation and unemployment numbers, but something in those reports doesn’t jive with reality. For most middle and lower income Americans, credit card debt is climbing to new highs, rents have soared, home ownership is unattainable, grocery prices are high and a Metallica “Standing Room Only” Field ticket is $575. So in my mind, we still have a percolating macroeconomic problem and the geopolitical and U.S. political issues seem to get worse by the day. Aside from that, the RSI has been over cooked for an extended period of time and we just had 8 consecutive green weekly candles. Both of those factors have historically led to corrections. I could give you the “History doesn’t have to repeat itself…” spiel or I can show you what historically happens after moves like this and let you decide. Another potential twist to consider is that the current PA has a striking resemblance to the first leg of the 2019 rally that turned out to be a Fib retracement, that ultimately got rejected from the top of the Golden Pocket at .618 Fib. That led to a 53% correction before the Covid Crash took it down more than 70% from the .618 Fib. At this stage, I’d be surprised to see a downside move that deep without the aid of a Black Swan, but we are currently having some interaction with the Golden Pocket that seems familiar. While it is reasonable to expect some resistance entering and exiting the Golden Pocket, there is one very weird twist to what we are seeing and that is a strange pattern I’ve noticed occurring on or around December 17th. Every year since 2017 there has been a move on December 17th that had Macro implications. The only exception to that is last year when it happened on December 20th. On each occasion the price action led to a macro breakout or breakdown. It’s too soon to tell if this move will validate the pattern on the day of writing (Dec 19th), but on the 17th we saw BTC get rejected from the lower end of the Golden Pocket and also lose the 21-Day moving average. Price has been flirting with both of those levels ever since so we’ll have to wait to see how it plays out over time. Aside from those things I’m watching the upcoming ETF window very closely. I think that the market is numb to SEC delays on these decisions, but there is so much anticipation that this time we’ll see an approval, that a flat out rejection has the potential to be the catalyst that triggers a correction. Regardless of where you side on whether we are or are not in a confirmed bull market, we’re seeing a lot of evidence that if we are not in it, we’re close to it. If you’re a long term investor and you haven’t already started building a position, it’s a good time to identify some targets to start scaling into one. This of course depends on your time horizon and risk appetite, but if you have a long term outlook and 6 figure targets for BTC it’s still early enough to get in, but it’s also a good idea to save some dry powder for a correction because in my opinion, it’s not a matter of if it will come, but when. Q: Right now, we are seeing Bitcoin reach new highs. Do you think we are in the early days of a full bull run? What has changed in the market that enabled the current price action; is it the Bitcoin spot ETF or the US Fed hinting at a loser policy or the upcoming Halving? What is the big narrative that will go on in 2024? MI: Despite the ongoing debate between bulls and bears over whether or not we’ve been in a bull market, I can say that despite the uptrend, there has been no clear confirmation that we’ve been in a bull market through most of the year. However, the fact that we’ve recently started to see more institutional sized bid ladders coming into the order book along with the on-chain data that indicates more wallets holding for longer and the recent buying after the R/S flip at $40k are indications that we may be on the verge of a breakout. There’s no doubt in my mind that a lot of the momentum we’ve been seeing is related to the next ETF decision window opening January 5-10 and the April 2024 Halving. The FED’s recent decision to pause rate hikes and hint at a pivot to cuts in 2024 certainly added fuel to that momentum that pushed price above $40k. In typical crypto form, we also had some help in late October through early December when I noticed some familiar patterns in the order book. I can’t confirm with absolute certainty if it was the Notorious B.I.D. spoofer we saw in Q1 returned, but it was the same game I identified through Q1 being executed and there is no question that it helped push price up through the $35k – $40k range before it disappeared. (…) As much as I’d like to see a correction come before we get there (the Bitcoin spot ETF decision), the market doesn’t care what I want. I would expect it to come before the Halving. Whether it comes before or after the ETF decision window closes remains to be seen. In the meantime, I’ll continue to watch order book and order flow data and trade what’s in front of me. Q: Last year, we spoke about the most resilient sectors during the Crypto Winter. Which sectors and coins will likely benefit from a new Bull Run? We are seeing the Solana ecosystem bloom along with the NFT market; what trends could benefit in the coming months? MI: The vast majority of my focus is on Bitcoin and to be honest, after seeing so many ponzi’s in the space, it’s the only digital asset I truly trust. There are certainly some great opportunities with certain alts, but with that comes increased risk. As for sectors, it’s no secret that AI and Gaming have been hot. According to some research I’ve been reviewing Memes, DePin and GambleFi are dominant narratives right now. The fact that Memes are more dominant than something that’s actually physical like DePin speaks to the immaturity of this market. Perhaps a better way of stating that is, “We are still early.” That said, if I’ve learned anything in crypto there is an opportunity cost associated with having high standards and principles for projects you invest in. As ridiculous as that may sound, the biggest upside potential seems to come from some of the most meaningless projects because they have large communities of “Crypto Bros” pumping them and thin liquidity makes them easy to pump. Just know that they also come with a huge risk and like every other ponzi, you don’t want to be the last guy holding the bag. I personally tend to avoid memes for all the reasons I mentioned above, but I do trade DOGE on occasion because it’s been a relatively easy scalp lately. Elon Musk playing kingmaker with that coin doesn’t make me like it any more or less (okay maybe less), but the results have been predictable. The fact he has obtained a money transfer license for X (Twitter) and that he has a DOGE logo on his X profile has me considering taking a flier on DOGE, but that’s not something I’m recommending to anyone who isn’t willing to lose that money. The fact he has SpaceX launching a DOGE sponsored satellite next month should at the very least bring a short term pump. Of the leading narratives mentioned, Memes may be the most dominant, but DePin is the most interesting to me, because it’s associated with something very real and very hot right now. For those who may not be familiar, DePin stands for Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks which are blockchain protocols that build, maintain and operate infrastructure for the AI industry. (Do Your Own Research). The fact that you mentioned Solana is proof that nothing changes sentiment like price. Solana has been through the ringer since falling from it’s ATH in November 2021 and the FTX crash of 2022 delivered another 80% correction that took it to single digit levels. There is no denying that it has been on an epic run recently. It’s somewhat puzzling to me how that is happening at the exact same time FTX liquidators have started the long process of distributing over $1B worth of $SOL back into the market.

Rather than speculate on what may be behind that, I’ll say that it is apparent that they have a very strong community and despite the network issues they’ve had in the past, they seem to be growing in popularity in staking pools. Then again, nothing influences sentiment like price, so I expect we’ll see a number of coins filter their way in and out of the leading narratives through the year. I’m just hoping more of them do so for legitimate reasons rather than fake news or P&D groups. IMO, until we see the projects with real teams, real use cases, real adoption and real revenue establishing themselves as the best projects to invest in for their fundamentals, “We’re still early.” Keith Alan is President at Keith Alan Productions, Inc., Co-Founder at Blacknox, LLC and Material Indicators, LLC.

These Bitcoin millionaires happen to be wallet addresses whose BTC holdings equal $1 million or above. Number Of Bitcoin Millionaires According to data from BitInfoCharts, there are currently 97,497 Bitcoin millionaires. This represents a significant increase from the beginning of the year when the number of wallet addresses equal to $1 million and above stood at 23,795, according to data from Glassnode. Related Reading: Why Did The XRP Price Surge To $0.64 Today? This development is attributed to the resurgence in Bitcoin’s price this year, with the crypto token seeing over 158% gain year-to-date. At the beginning of the year, Bitcoin’s price stood at just over $16,000. However, as the flagship cryptocurrency’s price began to rise, so did its number of millionaires. Further data from BitInfoCharts breaks down these Bitcoin millionaires into two categories. The number of addresses that are greater than $1 million stands at 90,040, while 7,457 wallet addresses hold $10 million or more. Meanwhile, other addresses below $1 million have also seen enormous profits. Market intelligence platform Santiment recently reported that 89% of the total Bitcoin supply is in profits. 2024 could be a better year for these addresses, considering that the Bull market is expected to kickstart next year. In the meantime, some of these Bitcoin millionaires and persons with significant holdings seem to be taking profits. NewsBTC recently reported how Bitcoin whales had sold around 50,000 BTC which equals to about $2.2 billion. BTC price retraces to $42,600 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com About Two Weeks To Go For Spot ETFs One of the biggest moments for Bitcoin and the crypto industry could come as early as January 10. This is around the period when experts are predicting that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the pending Spot Bitcoin ETFs, and there is optimism in the air as many actions point to an approval happening. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $1.33 ‘Pretty Fast’ Crypto stakeholders have had their eyes fixed on developments revolving around these Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The reason isn’t farfetched, as these funds could unlock fresh liquidity into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Trading firm QCP Capital had highlighted this as the catalyst to Bitcoin hitting its all-time high (ATH) and possibly new ATHs. At the same time, people like the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, Arthur Hayes, will be hoping that these ETFs don’t achieve much success as he says they could lead to Bitcoin’s downfall. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $42,678.76, down over 1% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Shiba Inu Sees Substantial Whale Activity A recent report revealed that a Shiba Inu whale has moved about 4 trillion SHIB tokens to an unidentified wallet. The whale activity came amidst the crypto asset’s price decline in tandem with the decline in the SHIB burn rate. Data from the on-chain tracker, Whale Alert, shows the unknown wallet 0x9c570088…a22fd8b51b move 4,239,147,213,294 SHIB to the unknown wallet address 0x72c3f4fc…fa8d75d719. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Climbs 12% On Christmas Day – Brewing Bull Run Or False Dawn? The on-chain tracker reported that the whale transaction was valued at $45.12 Million as of the time the transfer was made. Despite the magnitude of this transaction, the gas fee used to initiate the transfer was significantly low. Shiba Inu appears to be experiencing substantial whale activity of this size lately. This marks the second time that such transactions have been carried out in the past few days. On Sunday, December 24, Whale Alert also reported another whale transaction carried out by an unknown wallet. The whale transaction saw a staggering 4.25 trillion SHIB being transferred to an unidentified wallet, according to the on-chain tracker. The data shows that the aforestated SHIB was sent to the unknown wallet address 0x9c570088…a22fd8b51b by the wallet address 0x3ce6bed2…87d896c59f. As of the time of the transaction, the 4.25 trillion SHIB was valued at a whopping $46 million. In just two days, over 8.4 trillion SHIB tokens have been moved between unknown wallet addresses. This has since sparked speculations within the Shiba Inu community about whether these transactions signify a bearish or a bullish move. Nonetheless, the transfer of SHIB between unidentified wallets during a price decline might suggest that traders are feeling more confident. Shibarium Reaches Another Transaction Milestone Shiba Inu Layer 2 blockchain network Shibarium, has recently crossed a whopping 190 million in network transactions. This marks another major milestone for the project, indicating robust strength and activity within the ecosystem. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Eyes $0.00002 As Shibarium Marks Momentous Milestone According to data from Shibariumscan.io, the total number of completed transactions within the network is approximately 192,000,000. In addition, approximately 1,320,000 active addresses on the network contributed to this significant number of transactions. Furthermore, the Shibarium network’s daily transactions are currently sitting at about 7.53 million. Shibarium’s transaction volume has since increased from an average of 20,000 daily to over 7 million daily, putting the network in the limelight. Since it initially went past 7 million transactions daily over the past weeks, the blockchain has continued to maintain within that range. The rise in daily transactions demonstrates the meme coin’s quick growth and widespread adoption in the past few months. Currently, the price of Shiba Inu is down by 1% in the past 24 hours, trading at $0.00001067 as of the time of writing.

Worldcoin Appears To Be Showing A Bullish Breakout Currently In a new post on X, analyst Ali shared a chart for the 4-hour price of Worldcoin, which shows the formation of a bull flag for the cryptocurrency. A “bull flag” is a continuation pattern in technical analysis that, as its name suggests, looks like a flag on a pole. Bull flags form when a rapid uptrend in the price slows down and reverses in the opposite direction while consolidating inside a specific channel. The preceding uptrend forms the “pole,” while the channel shapes up the “flag.” Related Reading: Polkadot Shows Bearish Signal, Analyst Predicts Drawdown To This Target There are also bear flags, which form during periods of downtrend instead. The downward trajectory naturally forms the pole in this case and the flag corresponds to the consolidation towards a slight upside. In the context of the current discussion, the normal bull flag isn’t of interest, but rather a variant often called a “pennant” is. The usual bull flag forms when the consolidation happens between two parallel levels, while a pennant observes the asset moving between converging lines. Here is the chart posted by the analyst that reveals this pattern recently forming in the 4-hour price of Worldcoin: The price appears to have been breaking out of the pattern recently | Source: @ali_charts on X In this pattern, the top line is created by joining together lower highs, while the bottom line connects lower lows. Typically, the asset is probable to feel resistance at the upper level, while the lower level could act as support. A break beyond either of these lines can signal the continuation of the trend. From the chart, it’s visible that the 4-hour Worldcoin price had been consolidating inside the pennant channel just recently, but has now seen a break, as its price is surging above the upper level. Such a bullish breakout has generally led to strong uptrends in the past, with the length of the resulting uptrend often being comparable to the pole of the pattern. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Demand: Data Shows DOGE Adoption Is Accelerating The break has only just started to form, though, so a more sustained uptrend will have to be seen first to see if the pattern has truly taken place. “If confirmed, this could pave the way for WLD to enter an 80% rally, targeting $6.30,” says Ali. WLD Price Worldcoin had broken off toward the $4 level earlier in the past day, but the asset has quickly cooled off as it has already receded to the $3.7 mark. The below chart shows how WLD has performed during the last few days. Had this pullback not taken place, the bullish breakout may well have been confirmed. The coin would have to show some fresh momentum again now if the pattern has to complete.

21781964,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566984,1703601025,"Billionaire Tim Draper Predicts When The Bitcoin Price Will Reach $250,000","Billionaire Tim Draper has predicted a new all-time high for Bitcoin, foreseeing a staggering $250,000 rise for the cryptocurrency in 2024. Bitcoin To Reach $250,000 In a recent exclusive interview with Coin Bureau, a crypto informational portal, American venture capital investor, Tim Draper and Co-founder and CEO of Real Vision, Raoul Paul shared compelling insights on the outlook of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the space. Related Reading: Solana Breaks New Record, Will This Send SOL Price To $200? During the engaging conversation, Draper expressed highly bullish sentiments regarding Bitcoin’s future trajectory. When asked about his thoughts on Bitcoin’s price prediction, Draper confidently stated that BTC is poised to reach $250,000 soon. He hinted at the possibility of that surge happening in 2024, due to the present bullish trend on Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies. Draper, known for his success in Bitcoin investments also revisited a past Bitcoin projection he made. He stated that he had foreseen Bitcoin reaching $10,000 in three years and true to his foresight, the cryptocurrency achieved the milestone. “I would say that my number $250,000 will probably come pretty soon, so I’ll stick with $250,000. I think that if it hits $250,000, it’ll go way past it,” Draper stated. While addressing his $250,000 BTC forecast, Draper also mentioned a prior prediction where he anticipated the price of Bitcoin reaching $250,000 when its value was at $4,000. Despite the non-fulfillment of this particular prediction, Draper hinted at the possibility that the United States’ archaic approach towards cryptocurrencies may be stifling innovation and growth. “When I predicted that, what I didn’t expect was how fearful and just old thinking the US would be. I think with a receptive US, we would be having conversations like the ones I have with the people from El Salvador,” Draper stated. Presently, El Salvador is one of the few countries that has accepted Bitcoin as a legal tender. The country became the first to make Bitcoin a legal tender in September 2021, allowing its citizens to utilize BTC as a legal form of payment. BTC bears vie for control | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com Draper Unveils Stablecoins Crucial Role In Shaping BTC During the interview, Draper highlighted the role of stablecoins in the crypto space. The billionaire asserted that stablecoins could serve as a valuable support mechanism for BTC due to its price stability and seamless portability. “The role of stablecoins, I think, will be a bridge to bitcoin. I think the way stablecoins will operate, they will be viable as long as the dollar is viable, and then when there’s a run on the dollar, people will move to Bitcoin,” Draper stated. Related Reading: Why Did The XRP Price Surge To $0.64 Today? The billionaire also expressed a particular interest in smart contracts, highlighting its diverse use cases. He discussed the transformative impacts Bitcoin could bring into the financial sector through smart contracts. Draper stated: I’m a big fan of smart contracts. I can’t wait for the moment when I can raise all my investor money in Bitcoin, invest it all in Bitcoin, have them all pay their employees and suppliers and their taxes and everything else [in Bitcoin], and have it all be completely accounted for, audited, without an accountant, an auditor, a bookkeeper, a transfer agent, or a tax lawyer. This new economy will have far less friction.

21780155,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566971,1703595657,"Ethereum: Balancing Act At $2,300 – Scaling The Heights Or Facing A Looming Drop?","The past few weeks have been a rollercoaster ride for Ethereum. Buoyed by a waning Bitcoin dominance and an influx of traders seeking greener pastures, Ethereum’s price surged towards critical resistance levels near $2,500. Yet, a palpable anxiety lingers in the air, fueled by questions about Ethereum’s long-term scalability and the increasing chorus of bearish whispers. Can the second-largest crypto navigate this tightrope walk and reclaim its DeFi crown, or will it take a tumble from grace? Ethereum Rises: Growth, Innovations, And Challenges Beneath the surface of rising price charts lies a complex story of intertwined strengths and weaknesses. Ethereum’s impressive 87% year-on-year market cap surge, catapulting it from $140 billion to a hefty $267 billion, paints a picture of robust growth. Related Reading: Looking Deeper: Can ATOM Sustain Its 13% Surge Beyond The Network Buzz? The Merge upgrade, a landmark event streamlining Ethereum’s blockchain, and the burgeoning DeFi ecosystem pulsating with innovative applications are key contributors to this ascent. However, lurking beneath this facade is a critical bottleneck: Ethereum’s Layer 1 scalability limitations. The network’s notorious high transaction fees and sluggish throughput have become thorns in the side of DeFi expansion, frustrating both users and developers yearning for a smoother experience. As of writing, on this 26th of December, Ethereum’s price hovers around $2,233, painting the daily and weekly charts red with a dip of roughly 1.5%, data from Coingecko shows. This recent descent adds further intrigue to the complex dance Ethereum is performing near the critical $2,500 resistance level. This delicate dance between bullish aspiration and bearish pressure underscores the fragile equilibrium in the market. On one hand, the optimism surrounding Ethereum’s future potential continues to draw in traders. Ethereum currently trading at $2,230.5 territory. Chart: TradingView.com On the other hand, the specter of high transaction fees and scalability woes, alongside whispers of a potential bear market, keeps selling pressure simmering just below the surface. Ethereum At $2,300: Bulls’ Battle, Bears’ Threats For Ethereum bulls, the $2,300 level is a crucial battleground. If they can muster enough buy-side force to sustain a climb above this mark, it could pave the way for a surge towards the coveted $2,500 resistance level. This breakthrough would be a significant psychological victory, injecting fresh confidence into the market and potentially triggering a new upward trend phase. However, the bears are not out for the count. Their sights are set on breaching the $2,200 support level, which would solidify their grip and potentially trigger a more substantial decline. Should this scenario unfold, the $2,000 mark could come into play, with further losses possible if selling pressure remains unchecked. Adding to the intrigue is the factor of exchange supply. A recent increase in Ethereum tokens on exchanges indicates more readily available ETH for sellers, potentially amplifying downward pressure. This highlights the delicate balance between market sentiment and technical factors in determining Ethereum’s future trajectory. Meanwhile, the ETH traders’ profit-taking is evident in the Network Realized Profit/Loss between October 31 and December 23. A significant amount of profit-taking may cause the price of ETH to decline. Ethereum’s Critical Crossroads Ahead Looking ahead, Ethereum’s path hinges on its ability to navigate this complex landscape. Addressing its scalability issues through Layer 2 solutions and potential future upgrades will be crucial for maintaining and expanding its DeFi dominance. Related Reading: NEAR: 3 Reasons This Crypto Is Up 80% While Others Hibernate In The Run-Up To 2024 Rekindling developer and user confidence by reducing transaction fees and improving network throughput is also paramount. Only by tackling these internal challenges and adapting to the ever-evolving crypto sphere can Ethereum truly reclaim its throne as the king of DeFi. The next few weeks are likely to be pivotal for Ethereum. Will it scale the $2,500 height and cement its position as a leader in the crypto revolution? Or will internal limitations and external pressures force it to face a precipitous drop?

The price surge extended 30-day gains to over 240%, data tracked by Coingecko show, as trading volumes for the tokens jumped to over $50 million on Tuesday from just $2 million at the start of December.  Metis is part of a cohort of layer-2 scaling protocols that allow users to transact on the Ethereum blockchain faster and for cheaper fees but with their own ecosystem projects and tools.  Earlier this month, the MetisDAO Foundation, which maintains Metis, unveiled an Ecosystem Development Fund (EDF) of 4.6 million METIS dedicated to bootstrap development, liquidity, activity, and adoption in the Metis ecosystem.  The amount is worth over $360 million as of Tuesday at current prices. Disbursements to projects are expected to start in the first quarter of 2024 after the release of the Metis decentralized sequencer, or a technology that distributes nodes that process transactions all over the globe.  Users widely expect these rewards to trickle down to them as they use applications built on the Metis network. That has helped bolster the value locked on Metis projects to over $500 million as of Tuesday from just under $100 million last week, data shows.  Metis Ecosystem heats up  Tokens of some ecosystem projects have more than doubled in the past week: staking tool Maia’s MAIA token has surged 97%, and swapping protocol Hermes’ HERMES token has jumped 140%.

Some participants in the mtgoxinsolvency subreddit group said they had received payouts in yen over Paypal. Others, who’d chosen to receive cash into bank accounts, said they had not seen any inflows.  The exchange, launched in 2010, was the world's biggest when it was hacked in 2014. It was ultimately able to recover about 20% of the stolen funds. Earlier this year, it extended the deadline for repayments by 12 months until October 2024.  The repayment could have some impact on bitcoin prices, due to the sheer volume of the tokens being released, but would not destablize the market, UBS had said in a report earlier this year.

21778263,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566985,1703590226,Harmony To See Redemption? Analyst Predicts Meteoric 650% Rise For ONE Token,"The Harmony blockchain fell victim to one of the most infamous hacks in decentralized finance (DeFi) history and the fallout from that attack in 2022 saw the ONE price tank tremendously, losing over 98% of its all-time high value. However, one year later, the cryptocurrency seems to be making a comeback as investors and traders flip bullish once again. Crypto Analyst Predicts Great Things For ONE Token Crypto analyst Alan Santana has shared an analysis of the ONE token, the native cryptocurrency of the Harmony blockchain. In this analysis that focuses on one of the forgotten giants from the DeFi summer of 2021, Santana paints a rather bullish picture, the kind that hasn’t been shared for a while now. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Hit $1.33 ‘Pretty Fast’ The analysis focuses on the ONE/BTC pair which shows great promise compared to the ONE/USDT pair. This comes after the coin hit a new low of $0.008 this year, before rebounding, and this rebound seems to be the basis of its bullish trend. Santana explained that this particular growth had begun in October and has so far sustained given that the price is up more than 100% since then. However, the way forward is still not completely clear as t he crypto analyst points out that while the cryptocurrency has been able to break above its 200-day moving average (MA), it is now facing even more resistance. This resistance is now prominent at the 300-day exponential moving average (EMA). Source: Tradingview.com With the resistance moving upward, support for the coin has formed at the EMA200, proving to be an important level for the coin. From this level, a break above the EMA300 is actually what is needed for the altcoin to confirm its breakout from here. Santana posits that when this break happens, it’ll confirm the long-term growth potential for the ONE price. At this point, trading volume is expected to soar “and the daily sessions/candles become really big,” the analyst explains. Harmoney at $0.02 | Source: ONEUSDT on Tradingview.com Harmony Price Performance There are multiple price targets outlined by the crypto analyst for when the Harmony price does break the EMA300. From the current $0.02 level is an expected initial 650% jump right above $0.14 which starts it on its long-term bullish journey. Related Reading: Solana Breaks New Record, Will This Send SOL Price To $200? From there, the next target is placed at $0.16 which is an 850% move from the current trading levels. However, it doesn’t end there with a third target placed right above $0.33 which would complete the move. This last target would translate to a 1,400% increase. On its own, the ONE token is performing quite well considering the circumstances surrounding it. CoinMarketCap data shows that its price is up 5.56% in the last day, 40.5% in the last week, and 54.2% in the last month.

The Bitcoin miner has launched mining operations in the country where Bitcoin is viewed as a hedge against inflation, also benefiting from lower electricity costs there. The company's cost of operations is expected to decrease, making it more competitive in the mining industry. At the same time, the value of Bitcoin has appreciated by more than 50%. Therefore, it deserves better valuations, by 15%, but investors are also made aware of the volatility risks associated with this asset class. The last time I covered Bitfarms (BITF) on September 4, I had a hold position on the stock because of gloomy mining economics or relatively higher production costs, while Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) market price slid below the $30K support level. The stock has appreciated by more than 100% since as shown in the orange chart below, with the bulk of the upside occurring since November 20, which coincided with the election of Javier Milei as the President of Argentina. Comparing Price Returns (seekingalpha.com) Now, in addition to explaining the relationship between Bitfarms' upside and the election, this thesis aims to make a bullish case, this time through improving mining economics which should put the miner on par with the most efficient ones in the industry and is also favorable given the impending halving event, synonymous with a substantial reduction in the amount obtained for minting digital coins. Bitfarms' Argentinian Operations First, coming back to the above chart, I also included Bitcoin and another miner in the form of RIOT Platforms (RIOT) to show that the reason for Bitfarms' stock better appreciation was due to more than just enthusiasm for crypto. The reason was the launch of mining operations in Argentina more specifically in Rio Cuarto where it powered up its first crypto warehouse in September. As of October 31, it had approximately 15.3K mining rigs consuming 54 MW in that site which is second only to the Sherbrooke Campus in Quebec, Canada as shown below. Q3-2023 Earnings Call Presentation (seekingalpha.com) Now, the new President is viewed as being Bitcoin-friendly as he spoke positively about the cryptocurrency before the elections, and this could be because one of the objectives behind the creation of the cryptocurrency was to act as a hedge against inflation. In this case, unlike fiat currencies which can be printed at will by the Central banks of their respective countries, Bitcoin is limited in supply as only a total of 21 million can be mined which means that its value should increase over time. Moreover, we are currently at the 19 million level signifying that less than 10% can be mined. From this perspective, the President's enthusiasm for Bitcoin is understandable given the country's currency the Argentine Peso is highly depreciated relative to the U.S. dollar. Also, its Central bank's printing notes have fueled runaway inflation severely impacting the purchasing power of the people. Now, Bitfarms had been holding some of its investment in that country while awaiting the outcomes of the elections as a leader averse to Bitcoin could have put in jeopardy the lower cost of electricity it benefits in that country, which would have been detrimental to mining economics, or the need to keep production costs as low as possible. Improving Mining Economics In this context, Bitcoin is based on the ""proof of work"" system where thousands of mining rigs (or computing devices), solve mathematical problems that allow a new transaction or block to be added to the blockchain. This involves intense competition as there are also other miners trying to be the first to complete transactions. Furthermore, after adding a new block, miners are rewarded in Bitcoins, but the problem is that this reward is halved every four years according to the halving principle, defined from the start in the Bitcoin white paper. To date, this reward is 6.25 BTCs per validated block, compared to 3.125 BTCs at the next halving which will take place in the coming April. Therefore, given that mining equipment is energy-intensive, this means that miners have to become more efficient, as, in addition to the problem of increasing mining difficulty due to the competition intensifying, halving will reduce rewards by 50%. Before that, there were halving events in 2012, 2016, and 2020, and up to now, miners have been able to adapt by making up for the revenue shortfalls by both upgrading their mining rigs with more power-efficient ones and looking for cheaper electricity sources. Thus, Bitfarms installed approximately 2,900 new Antminer S19j Pro+ in one of its Quebec sites to replace the older generation equipment during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 (Q3) and is focusing on low-cost hydropower in Canada and Latin America to more efficiently expand its operating capacity. static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/sa_presentations/615/97615/original.pdf Talking mining economics, Bitfarms' cost per BTC was $22,700 in Q3 which included G&A (General and Administrative) expenses. Looking across the industry, this is about the same as for HIVE Digital Technologies (HIVE) whose average cost of production per Bitcoin was $22,639 for the same period but, noteworthily, excluding SG&A. However, Bitfarms' costs are much higher than RIOT whose year-to-date average cost to mine was $5,537 per Bitcoin for the quarter ending on September 30 (Q3). Diving deeper, RIOT had a higher production capacity at the end of Q3, reaching a production capacity or hash rate of 10.9 EH/s compared to only 6.1 EH/s for Bitfarms. Moreover, the larger miner's flexible energy contracts enable it to take advantage of highly discounted prices during periods of low demand. It can then scale back during periods of high demand thereby saving on costs. This flexibility has positioned it as the miner with the lowest cost of production as it paid only 2.8 cents per kWh according to an August report which is about 2.5 times less than for other industrial use cases. However, Bitfarms is catching up with its Rio Cuarto farm in Argentina benefiting from around $0.03 (or 3 cents) per kWh during the month of summer which started in October and would end in April 2024, coinciding with the halving event. Tellingly, this is Bitfarms' lowest-cost facility and makes for about 23% of the miner's total operating capacity. Valuing Bitfarms Looking at historical performance, it has been able to reduce operating loss significantly from above $150 million in 2022 to $15 million-$25 million . Now, based on kWh pricing, it could also benefit from about the same average cost to mine a Bitcoin as RIOT or roughly $5.5K, which is about four times less than the $22.7 it currently incurs. Even if this price is effective for 23% of its production, or the portion that originates from Argentina, this could accelerate break-even status. This implies that Bitfarms can become profitable earlier than the third quarter of 2024 as expected by analysts as shown below. Earnings estimates per quarter (seekingalpha.com) Looking further, Bitfarms could also achieve profitability status faster through improved revenues, namely by harvesting more money for the same quantity of crypto produced, made possible by the higher market price of Bitcoin. As such, quarterly revenues have varied between $30 million to $35 million this year depending mainly on the quantity of Bitcoins sold and its unit price. Now, since the value of one BTC has appreciated from less than $28K in the third quarter to more than $43K currently, this means that revenues can potentially increase by at least 53% (43/28) for the fourth quarter (Q4 which lasts from October to December) from $39.89 million to $63.03 million as calculated in the table below. As a result, total revenues of $140.09 million for FY-2023 could be incremented to $161 million which translates to a lower forward P/S of 5.83x. This ultimately means a target of $3.44 based on the current share price of $2.99. The table was built using data from (www.seekingalpha.com) Therefore, with its Argentinian operations, Bitfarms appears in a better position to face up to next year's halving event which is expected to increase Bitcoin's production cost to about $ 40K for miners who do not have access to low-cost electricity. Thinking aloud, some will not be able to survive halving if the price of Bitcoin is not sustained at current levels. This means that fewer blocks will be added to the blockchain, which may ultimately reduce the supply of the cryptocurrency, thereby increasing its price. A Buy but Risk Awareness Remains Key However, in addition to a possible reduction in supply, higher crypto prices have also been driven by two factors. The first is the Federal Reserve turning more dovish as to monetary policy with three successive pauses or neutral instances, and more in the market pricing rate cuts for next year. This has boosted the value of tech and crypto stocks. Second, there is a higher expectation of a Bitcoin spot ETF to be approved as early as next year after applications have been filed by some of Wall Street giant issuers including BlackRock (BLK). There is also the fact that crypto asset manager Grayscale Investments has emerged victorious in its court appeal against the SEC (Security Exchange Commission) for launching a similar ETF. Conversely, any signs of rates staying higher for longer or the SEC delaying the approval of a spot ETF may result in abrupt market volatility for cryptos, possibly in January according to a recent update by the SEC's Chairman as his team of regulators scan through applications. Therefore, in case you have missed the upside, you may want to stay on the sidelines and wait for a better margin of safety. This said, $3.44, is a fair target given that the market appears to already have priced most of the Argentinian opportunity. Finally, with $46.8 million in cash in its balance sheet and 703 BTCs worth around $33 million (based on a $43K per unit price) in its treasury as of September 30, 2023, the company can easily pay its debt of $26.3 million. It also raised $31 million through an equity offering during Q3. Thus, it can further invest in production capacity in Argentina where Bitfarms benefits from one of the cheapest electricity rates in Latin America to drastically reduce the cost of operations.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4659632-bitfarms-better-mining-economics-in-argentina?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/21776289.jpeg

However, upon closer inspection, the narrative surrounding Cosmos unveils a more nuanced story. Despite the accolade of being at the forefront of blockchain network activity, a discerning analysis reveals a dip in actual user engagement and transaction volumes. Surprisingly, against the backdrop of these statistics, Cosmos has witnessed a remarkable 13% surge in its token price over the past week, prompting a deeper inquiry into the factors propelling its momentum.

Source: Artemis Despite the declining activity metrics, ATOM’s price defied the trend, showcasing a 6% gain over the last 24 hours, data from Coingecko shows. This disconnect highlights the influence of factors beyond user engagement, including the broader market bullishness and potentially, speculation fueled by a spike in ATOM’s MVRV ratio, a profitability indicator. The Power Of Partnerships And Policy: Catalysts For Growth While the overall market sentiment played a role, key developments within the Cosmos ecosystem also contributed to ATOM’s ascent. The recent merger between Osmosis and UX Chain solidified their foothold within the Cosmos landscape, bolstering cross-chain DeFi capabilities. ATOM market cap currently at $4.58 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Additionally, the Cosmos Hub’s governance decision to reduce ATOM’s inflation rate from 14% to 10% addressed concerns surrounding stability and security, potentially attracting further investment. Despite the recent rally, ATOM’s technical indicators paint a somewhat cautious picture. The daily chart presents a bearish MACD signal, and the Chaikin Money Flow’s sideways movement suggests a potential extension of the current price consolidation. The Road Ahead: A Balancing Act Cosmos faces the challenge of bridging the gap between headline-grabbing network activity metrics and actual user engagement. The recent decline in transactions and addresses raises questions about long-term sustainability. Nevertheless, the ecosystem’s strategic partnerships, focus on DeFi integration, and proactive governance decisions provide promising counterpoints. ATOM price action in the last week.

Its trajectory has been one of sustained upward momentum, a trend that notably took root around mid-December and has continued to gather strength. Unlike the general market sentiment characterized by a downturn, NEAR has not only weathered the storm but has surged impressively. Over the last seven days, the cryptocurrency has experienced a significant 80% increase in value, a feat that has not gone unnoticed by market participants and enthusiasts alike. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Climbs 12% On Christmas Day – Brewing Bull Run Or False Dawn? This surge has effectively propelled NEAR to double its base value, which stood at $4.24, signaling a robust and impressive performance in contrast to the prevailing market conditions. Here are three reasons why this token is thawing in the run-up to 2024: NEAR: Technical Resilience NEAR’s upward trajectory is not a mere coincidence but is supported by robust technical indicators. A decisive price breakout on December 21st shattered a crucial resistance level at $4.0, paving the way for sustained growth. This breakout generated warmth for further price appreciation. Furthermore, an ascending trendline, currently positioned at $3.7, acts as a reliable support against potential downward movements. The Average Directional Index (ADX) at 40% signals potential buyer exhaustion but also indicates a healthy correction for long-term bullishness, portraying an enduring technical strength that is not easily extinguished. NEAR market cap currently at $4.292 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Community Momentum NEAR’s success is not a solitary achievement; it is a result of a thriving community. The trading volume has surged impressively by 170% over the past week, reaching over $410 million on December 25th alone. This surge in trading activity underscores the growing investor confidence. Open Interest (OI), representing future buying potential, has also surpassed $140 million, reflecting a shared optimism that NEAR’s flame is burning bright. Source: CoinAlyze This fervent belief adds fuel to the fire, attracting a considerable number of new participants—over 48,000 in the past week—drawn to the warmth of the NEAR ecosystem. Future Roadmap Looking ahead, NEAR’s future appears ablaze with ambitious plans outlined in its 2024 development roadmap. These plans include high-speed transactions exceeding 100,000 per second, enhanced scalability to eliminate bottlenecks, and the introduction of innovative dApps like Nightshade 2.0, promising enhanced privacy and security. Related Reading: XRP In December 2023: Decoding An 800% Nostalgia And The Hope For $1 These developments solidify NEAR’s position as a frontrunner in the crypto space, leaving competitors in the shadows and envying its progress. NEAR’s ability to withstand the challenges of the current market makes it a beacon of hope for investors seeking both warmth and growth. As market conditions gradually improve, NEAR is poised to breach the $5 barrier, representing a potential 30% increase from its current price. This outlook is likely to attract those yearning to escape the chill of the crypto winter, further cementing NEAR’s position as a noteworthy player in the evolving crypto landscape.

MATIC’s current price stands at $0.8939, accompanied by a 24-hour trading volume of $701,503,128.22. This represents a notable 4.20% price increase within the last 24 hours and a remarkable 14.10% increase over the past 7 days. Polygon Founder Embraces Underdog Status Despite a challenging journey throughout 2023, Polygon’s founder, Sandeep Nailwal, recently expressed his contentment with the platform’s underdog status. In a statement on X (formerly Twitter), Nailwal stated: Polygon is back to where it’s the best at being an underdog. Not going to lie, it’s been a painful ride, the whole of 2023, but right now, it feels incredibly liberating to be the underdog again. Furthermore, Nailwal went on to outline several reasons why he believes investors should feel bullish about Polygon’s prospects. One key feature is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Compatibility, which allows Polygon to replicate the Ethereum environment as a rollup. This compatibility ensures that any application running on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible chains can be deployed onto zkEVM, Polygon’s layer 2 solution, with minimal modifications. Related Reading: A Crypto Christmas Special With Jlabs Digital: Past, Present, And Future Another aspect highlighted is the utilization of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for transaction validation. By leveraging ZKPs, Polygon enhances transaction speeds and reduces gas fees, addressing critical pain points experienced by users on other blockchain platforms. Scalability is a paramount concern in the blockchain industry, and Polygon aims to address this challenge by executing smart contracts using zero-knowledge technology. This approach ensures “scalability without compromising decentralization” and security, bolstering the platform’s overall appeal to developers and users alike. Moreover, Polygon’s strategic affiliation with zkEVM positions it to leverage the existing ecosystem of over 400 decentralized applications (dApps) within the Polygon network. This ecosystem includes a diverse range of DeFi protocols, gaming platforms, and NFT marketplaces. By capitalizing on this thriving ecosystem, Polygon aims to further solidify its position as a leader in the blockchain space. Midterm Targets And Strategy For MATIC Price Action Renowned analyst Captain Faibik has released a comprehensive analysis of the price action for Polygon’s native token, MATIC. In his assessment, Captain Faibik identifies key targets and a strategic approach for investors to capitalize on potential gains. According to Captain Faibik’s analysis, MATIC’s midterm targets are projected at $1.20, $1.60, $2.50, and $4.00. These targets represent potential price levels that MATIC could reach based on historical patterns. Notably, to manage risk and protect their investment, Captain Faibik recommends implementing a stop-loss strategy. If the weekly closing price of MATIC falls below $0.55, it is suggested to exit the position. Related Reading: Solana Breaks New Record, Will This Send SOL Price To $200? Furthermore, Captain Faibik advises investors to adopt a long-term mindset and hold their MATIC investment for a minimum of 60 days. This holding period enables investors to ride out short-term price fluctuations and potentially capitalize on the projected targets identified.

21763858,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=566893,1703548847,"Polkadot Shows Bearish Signal, Analyst Predicts Drawdown To This Target","A cryptocurrency analyst has explained how Polkadot could potentially see a decline to this level because of a sell signal in in its weekly price chart. Polkadot Weekly Price Has Formed A TD Sequential Sell Setup Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali has pointed out that a TD Sequential sell signal has been forming for Polkadot recently. The “TD Sequential” refers to a tool in technical analysis that’s generally used for pinpointing likely points of reversal in any asset’s price. The indicator is made up of two phases. In the first phase, called the setup, candles of the same polarity are counted up to 9. After the ninth candle, a probable reversal in the price may be assumed to have taken place. Related Reading: Dogecoin In Demand: Data Shows DOGE Adoption Is Accelerating If the setup’s completion occurred with the overall trend being towards the up (that is, the nine candles were green), the asset might have hit a top. Similarly, a bottom could be in if the price had been going down. The second phase, known as the “countdown,” begins right after the setup’s completion and lasts for thirteen candles. At the end of these thirteen candles, another probable reversal in the asset could be assumed to have occurred. Recently, Polkadot’s weekly price has completed a TD Sequential phase of the former type, as the chart below shared by the analyst shows. Looks like the cryptocurrency has seen nine green candles in this setup | Source: @ali_charts on X As is apparent from the graph, the Polkadot weekly price has finished the TD Sequential setup phase with green candles recently. This could suggest that a sell signal has now formed for the cryptocurrency. In the same chart, Ali has also displayed the data for the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA) for the asset, a level that has been a source of resistance in the past. Interestingly, this TD Sequential setup has completed just as the weekly price of the cryptocurrency has approached the 100-day EMA. “This could lead to a spike in profit-taking, potentially driving DOT down to $7.50,” explains the analyst. From the current spot price, a drawdown to this level would mean a drop of more than 18% for Polkadot. DOT Is Up Almost 3% During The Last 24 Hours While these bearish developments have occurred in the weekly price of DOT, the asset has still continued to rise during the past day, as its price has now cleared the $9.2 level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Do $2.2 Billion Selloff, But BTC Stays Strong Below is a chart that shows how Polkadot has performed during the past month. The price of the asset seems to have shot up during this period | Source: DOTUSD on TradingView The green returns during the last 24 hours are a continuation of the bullish momentum that DOT has enjoyed in the past week, a window inside which it’s now up almost 39%. Though the asset has been able to continue this run for now, the technical obstacles it’s facing in terms of the TD Sequential and 100-day EMA could mean that the top might be near for the coin.
