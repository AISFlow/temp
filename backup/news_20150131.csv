42398197,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSllr,1422713599,IBM's Richard Gendal Brown: Bitcoin is Opening Minds,"One of bitcoin's most important historic legacies may be the way it merges disparate fields of study to find unexpected solutions to old problems, according to one of the space's key thinkers.  CoinDesk spoke to IBM UK's executive architect for innovation in banking and financial markets, Richard Gendal Brown, to get his overview of what this disruptive new technology might hold in store for the future.  A far better-educated class of graduates is now emerging from universities thanks to bitcoin's existence, Brown said, adding:  ""This is a field where you truly have to be interdisciplinary to make progress.""  People with academic backgrounds like engineering and computer science, who previously would have had little exposure to finance or economics, are now endowed with much greater awareness of how financial systems work, and what the possibilities and problems are.  People looking at old problems in a new way, he said, ""can't help but lead to exciting possibilities in the future"".  There will be products and services that may not have been imagined yet, but which will come into existence thanks to these new perspectives.  Thinking ahead  Brown's position gives him the enviable opportunity to spend time examining blockchain technology and extrapolating on where it might lead, both for IBM's own clients and the rest of us.  Or as Brown himself puts it: ""Where are things going, and what does that mean for what we should do together today?""  His blog has been cited as one of cryptocurrency philosophy's regular must-reads. More recently, he has been a leading voice in predicting that distributed ledger technology would extend far beyond bitcoin's payment mechanisms and into the wider fields of contract law, smart property, aspects of decentralized trust and solving the question of identity.  The importance of miners  One particular stand-out comment in late 2014 was Brown's regular assertion that currency was perhaps the ""least interesting thing about bitcoin"" and its underlying technology.  It would be wrong, however, to assume this implies bitcoin as a currency is not an interesting application. Rather, Brown's level of interest is such that the world-changing implications of distributed ledger and consensus technologies are simply more appealing to think about.  He also not intend to diminish the importance of the currency use-case, and bitcoin's value, in securing the network by providing miners with something to pay for expensive equipment and electricity bills.  He said:  ""What I've come to stress more clearly over the last couple of months is: the security of the architecture underpinning decentralized systems like bitcoin does come from the incentivization of the miners.""  Then there is the fact that other distributed applications often require some form of payment mechanism to function, so it's handy to have one already built in.  Bifurcation of focus  The placing of importance on either the currency/payments application or distributed ledger technology is creating the current bifurcation of development, which we now see in startups which focus on bringing bitcoin into the mainstream consumer space on one side, and more theoretical 'crypto 2.0' projects on the other.  In a personal capacity, Brown recently joined the advisory board of one such project, decentralized asset registry Hyperledger, joining fellow crypto-commentator Tim Swanson.  Core currency use cases, to the extent they happen, will be driven by consumer applications, Brown said. ""But I don't see the chain of logic that concludes with major banks doing something with the currency itself.""  A limited factor in the payments field is that consumers in 'developed' economies aren't crying out for better solutions right now. Current systems available, despite their fees and security flaws, are still adequate for most people.  Major firms are more likely to find something compelling in distributed ledger technology, and would likely drive development in that space, he said.  Identity and reputation layer  Managing online identities and reputations is one important aspect of the technology in various crypto 2.0 applications – both in interfacing with existing know your customer/anti-money laundering systems and in developing new types of apps.  ""I think certain use cases can't develop until there is some notion of identity,"" Brown said.  Using a colored coin-type platform as an example, he gives the example of a corporation that wishes to issue a blockchain-based bond. There are several identity issues that need to be resolved:  ""Firstly, how does anybody else in the system know that that issuer is who they say they are? If I'm going to pay good money for a colored coin that represents $100m of a corporate bond issue, I'd better be completely sure that it really was issued by that company or someone acting on its behalf.""  It needs to be more sophisticated than simply signing the issuing document with the company's SSL key, given that the person authorized to issue bonds is probably a different individual to the one who controls the key.  ""You can also flip that, though – you've then got the obligation on the issuer to know who its lenders are. If I'm a US corporation and I have an obligation to pay a coupon once a quarter, or whatever, I will be in big trouble if I pay that coupon to a sanctioned entity.""  It would be necessary to know who is holding the colored coins on the date of payment and, to avoid people gaming the system, the corporation would need to know who is holding the coin in the intervening periods as well, to make sure it hasn't just been moved to a sanctioned entity and then back again.  Opportunity for entrepreneurs  There is a real opportunity for entrepreneurs to innovate in this space, Brown continued. One point where crypto 2.0 projects could add some value is finding out how to encode and describe the rules that would govern something like the aforementioned bond issuance.  ""There's a whole collection of law and thinking that needs to come together then to make this space work, and it's one of the reasons I find this space intellectually stimulating, because there are new problems to solve.""  In considering crypto 2.0 applications, Brown also writes of concepts like the ""continuum of decentralization"" and the ""unbundling of trust"", where the choice between centralized and decentralized is not black and white, and various centralized or trusted entities (like banks' KYC requirements, or identities of bond issuers) can live at certain points on bitcoin's distributed backbone.  The sidechains concept, while only one potential solution of many, is one way that centralized entities could integrate with bitcoin technology, making it unnecessary to invent a new cryptocurrency with its own blockchain for every new application.  ""It now gives us a way to bridge between the attempt at decentralization that bitcoin gives you, and the need sometimes to impose more controls because the business model demands it, or the law demands it. Previously it was one or the other.""  Opening minds  All this brings us back to Brown's unifying message: that many of these problems might not even be considered were it not for the new merging of computer science disciplines with the needs of the financial and legal worlds.  ""People tend of have a more open mind and are willing to think about things without the usual constraints of their day jobs.""  Whether it's a better global payments system or something fundamentally changing organizational structures, the real 'killer app' for the burgeoning technological field may still be some way off.  It something not even considered yet, Brown said, or ""an unexpected problem, to be solved with all manner of technologies ... It's an entry point for interesting conversation, if not necessarily the solution.""

42398204,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbSlqm,1422705994,Coinsetter CEO: Taking on Credit Cards Isn't Bitcoin's Big Opportunity,"Jaron Lukasiewicz wants to find the room where the rock stars hang out.  The 29-year-old CEO of US bitcoin exchange Coinsetter radiates energy as we pace the halls of Miami's famed Fillmore Theatre, cutting past utility rooms and navigating stairwells adorned with images of rock 'n' roll excess.  It’s early in the first day of the North American Bitcoin Conference and Lukasiewicz has just delivered an impassioned speech, one in which he railed against the perception that bitcoin is a viable alternative to credit cards for consumers. Though not necessarily related directly to his business-to-business (B2B) exchange, he seems unusually passionate about where the industry is going wrong in this area and how it needs to refocus.  Finally at rest on a beat-up backstage couch, Lukasiewicz launches into a more detailed criticism of how bitcoin has so far been positioned as a payment solution for consumers, tying his ideas to the bigger picture for his New York-based exchange.  Using his first company Ticketometer as an example, Lukasiewicz argued that just because something has perceived benefits, doesn’t mean it will gain traction in the market.  Lukasiewicz told CoinDesk:  “At Ticketometer we thought, 'why would you ever sell tickets in a risky fashion? You should just risklessly sell tickets, and if a minimum number of tickets are sold then the event will happen'. What you learn in doing that is it’s a logical idea, but when you do it, there are so many reasons why someone would not want to do that.”  Lukasiewicz suggests the bitcoin industry is at a similar moment in its history. With the initial excitement of discovery fading, he believes more entrepreneurs should start asking hard questions about consumer behavior, should the industry want to expand its reach.  He also acknowledged that this thought process was inspired by his need to believe in the industry and widen its message. The remarks echoed the sentiments of OKCoin CEO Star Xu, who also used the event as a forum for talking about how the fate of his exchange is tied to the network at large.  “I’ve learned about where the opportunity is in the credit card space, and it wasn’t what I thought. It was more like, becoming the last mile,” he added.  The problem of exchange  To Lukasiewicz, the root of the problem goes back to the nature of Coinsetter’s business: exchange. While currently beneficial for merchants, he contends that consumers are overpaying when making a purchase with bitcoin.  “One of the problems I figured out with the industry is that merchant defines the exchange rate,” he said, explaining how bitcoin payment processors set the price at which they will accept bitcoin for a sale before sending US dollars to a business.  It’s here, Lukasiewicz argues, that consumers are being short-changed, as bid prices represent the maximum price a buyer is willing to pay.  “By using the bid, merchants are able to pass 100% of the costs onto the consumer, so they get rid of the spread. The spread is a cost that’s passed on to the consumer as well as the slippage and any other fees associated at the ‘ask’ price,” Lukasiewicz continued, adding:  “If you buy something for $100, you should have $100 taken off your bank statement, that is the price.”  Lukasiewicz argues that bid-based pricing leads bitcoin buyers to pay more, say $102 on a $100 purchase, whereas consumers making credit card purchases are typically offered rewards.  As for changing the underlying issue, however, Lukasiewicz is less optimistic, here again suggesting that entrenched practices will erode any benefit.  Payment processors, he said, could encourage merchants to offer consumers discounts, but he suggests they would face pressure from merchants who want to avoid added costs. Rather, Lukasiewicz believes the true potential of bitcoin in this industry will lie in helping credit card users to pay with their preferred brand in more places.  ""Allowing card payers to pay with their AmEx more places and things like that,"" he said.  The case for remittance  Rather than focusing on bitcoin for e-commerce, however, Lukasiewicz advocated both in the interview and his speaking slot that entrepreneurs should focus on the far more costly global remittance market.  “It just fits so clearly,” he said. “You do have these challenges of teaching immigrants to buy bitcoin and hold it and send it somewhere, but it’s still been made pretty good.”  Though high bitcoin ATM fees might be a continued sticking point for consumers in the developing world, Lukasiewicz believes the reduced costs provided by this infrastructure will be compelling, even despite the learning curve some users will have.  “If you go [via] bitcoin to another currency, they’re not going to understand the exchange rates, but they will understand the reduced fees,” he added. “I don’t think it’s a blocker.”  In this view of the ecosystem, consumers will be able to use bitcoin ATMs and wallets as alternatives to traditional banks. Lukasiewicz added that Coinsetter is seeking to develop business connections in this space, serving as a source of liquidity for ATM providers, such as BitAccess and Robocoin.  “For us, it would be creating connectors for the various ATM manufacturers,” he said.  'Win or die' situation  Overall, Lukasiewicz indicated that the bitcoin industry needs to operate more effectively and concertedly in certain areas of the financial ecosystem, and that companies need to see how they can specialize in serving a useful role toward this end.  “When I talk to people starting remittance companies, they think they have a network effect,” Lukasiewicz said. “I tell them, you don’t, that doesn’t exist in bitcoin. Bitcoin is the network and that’s the only network that exists, we all win or we all die.”  For its part, Lukasiewicz said Coinsetter is still narrowly focused on serving larger market makers and on improving its liquidity, factors he framed as essential to its survival.  Still, Lukasiewicz argued specialization can yield important and overlooked insights.  “When you start to build an exchange and you offer it to a market, you hear what people want. When I started building our FIX API, I had no idea how important that would be, and that’s the most important thing we offer right now,” he explained.  Yet another part of the equation, Lukasiewicz suggested, is that a business can’t be the best at everything. In particular, he cited his company’s front-end user interface as a potential turn off to more retail clients – a factor he intends to put right this year.  Ultimately, though, he is confident that this philosophy has prepared Coinsetter well for what appears to be a coming uptick in US bitcoin exchanges serving the market.  “I think what we built and have a chance to build, other people don’t anytime soon,"" Lukasiewicz concluded.
