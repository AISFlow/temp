42426161,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQdh,1415738772,Meet the Tiny Bitcoin Wallet that Lives Under Your Skin,"A bitcoin entrepreneur and ‘biohacking’ enthusiast has found an unlikely place to store digital currency – under his skin.      Martijn Wismeijer, also known as ‘Mr Bitcoin’, had two NFC (near-field communication) chips injected into the back of his hands during a biohacking event organised by Permanent Beta last week.      Speaking to CoinDesk, Wismeijer said he has so far experimented with storing litecoin, darkcoin, dogecoin and bitcoin on the tiny devices, which can hold up to 888 bytes of data each.      “As long as you can export your private key, you can write that into your hands,"" he added.      Although these tests have proved successful, Wismeijer will not be using the implants as a long-term offline store for his cryptocurrency. This is because the media coverage he has received is likely to compromise their security, he said.      However, Wismeijer stressed that the chips are a viable, stealthy storage option for users who are a little more camera-shy:      “If you are a bit more discreet about your implant, nobody will ever know it's there. Apparently the chips don't show up in a full-body scanner at airports ... totally secret agent style, available to consumers everywhere.""            'Wow' effect    After stumbling across bitcoin in November 2010, Wismeijer said he became fascinated with the blockchain. ""[It] gave me the same 'wow' effect as the world-wide-web in the early '90s,"" he added.      Four years on, the Dutch native has gone from mining bitcoins on an old laptop and tinkering with APIs to running an international ATM collective that helps operators with everything from compliance to general repairs.      @gavinandresen Thanks for the Kodak moment at #Bitcoin2014 pic.twitter.com/con95yR63N      — MrBitcoin (@MrBitc0in) May 16, 2014        Storing the currency inside his body is simply another experiment for Wismeijer, albeit an extreme one. DangerousThings, the website selling the $99 gadget, warns it hasn't yet been cleared for use in humans.    Indeed, with doctors out of the question, there is only one technician in the Netherlands known to install DangerousThings' pre-loaded injection kit – Tom van Oudenaarden, an Ultrecht-based 'body manipulation artist' who specialises in 3D implants and body suspension.    There are risks too. Once the pain is gone – Wismeijer said this takes around a day or so – you can start programming the chip. But testing the device any sooner could be dangerous, he cautioned, explaining:    ""Don't be like me, I wanted to try it out even before the blood dried up ... everyone wants to try it out right away but in case of the implant really you should leave it alone until it is no longer swollen and healed.""  Not following this advice, he continued, might risk infection and ultimately the body could reject the implant entirely.  About the implant    The implant itself is a tiny glass capsule 2x12mm in size that contains a radio frequency identification tag (RFID) – a smart, programmable barcode historically associated with tracking pets and retail products.      Like a pet’s microchip, Wismeijer’s tag is biocompatible and requires no battery. Instead, it receives power and data from paired devices (smartphones, tablets) via its NFC antenna.      ""[There's] no charging required, no toxic batteries inside. The chip can be written to about 100,000 times before it needs replacement so in theory it should last a lifetime,"" Wismeijer said.      Storing cryptocurrency on the device is a relatively pain-free process, installation aside. First, you disable the lock bits so your chip can't be made read-only. Next, using an NFC app like NXP Tagwriter, you write in your private keys as 'text' tags – one private key per line – and program this into your device.      888 bytes of data are equal to 888 characters of text. Thus, according to Wismeijer’s calculations, the device can store 26 different mini private keys around 33 characters long. Since not all users will need this capacity, Wismeijer recommends securing private keys using BIP-38 encryption, which extends each private key to 58 characters.      Although there is no wear and tear when scanning, each chip only stores data for about a decade. For this reason, users will need to rewrite, or 'refresh' their tag every 10 years or so to avoid loss.    Future uses  Though the implant's functionality is currently limited by the amount of data it can store, bigger, better upgrades may be on the horizon.  ""I met with Amal Graafstra, the engineer behind this biohacking implant and he is working on exciting new models with more memory but these will be larger and more difficult to install as they will probably have to be unfolded under the skin as opposed to just be injected,"" he said.  In a field such as this, specialists experimenting with the technology are few and far between. However, Wismeijer predicts that there are now around 3,000 people with an implant like his.  Indeed, the pre-loaded injection kit raised 383% of its $8,000 goal during its launch on crowdfunding site Indiegogo last December. New uses are still being discovered too, including those that already impact Wismeijer's day-to-day life. For example, the entrepreneur plans to test out his NFC tags on a wireless door lock for his home and as an off-switch for his alarm clock.  “I have real-world uses for it today, my phones and tablets are all compatible (Android only, sorry iOS users) and have been for the past two years,"" he said, adding: ""I personally feel that by supporting these biohacking developments we can learn what works and what doesn't.""",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | MINING,Grace Caffyn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/11/11/meet-the-tiny-bitcoin-wallet-that-lives-under-your-skin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f25baaf41c5fa045e5f28bcf116e8032ce325fc8-1456x693.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426166,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQnh,1415731021,New Tool TorBan Helps Monitor Bitcoin-Over-Tor Attacks,"Days after researchers described an attack that could reveal the identities of individuals who used bitcoin over the Tor anonymity network, a privacy advocate has developed a tool to monitor the occurrence of that attack.  The tool, TorBan, is a website that gives information about the Tor exit nodes currently connected to the bitcoin network.  If all the connections are fresh, users should be wary of a privacy-invading attack like the one described by the Luxembourg researchers, TorBan's creator Kristov Atlas said, adding:  ""If you see a bunch of new nodes never seen before, and all of the ones that have been seen for a long time are no longer seen, that's suspicious.""  Atlas said he was inspired to write TorBan by the University of Luxembourg paper, which was written by Ivan Pustogarov and Alex Biryukov, of the university's cryptology research group.  The paper outlined an attack that could unmask a bitcoin user who connected to the digital currency's network using Tor.  Banning Tor networks  The privacy incursion relies on exploiting the bitcoin protocol's built-in protection against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which bans clients that it thinks are DoS-ing it. By DoS-ing bitcoin servers from the Tor network, an attacker would cause all Tor exit-nodes to be banned from the bitcoin network.  The attacker can then run their own Tor exit nodes or bitcoin servers, waiting for a victim to connect. Victims are susceptible because they wind up using the attacker's Tor exit-node or her bitcoin server because all legitimate exit-nodes would have been banned by the bitcoin network.  TorBan traces the history of exit-nodes connected to the bitcoin network. If all the nodes are new, it could indicate that a malicious actor has triggered a ban of Tor exit-nodes by bitcoin servers, setting the stage for an attack.  Atlas said he wrote TorBan quickly as a ""proof of concept"" that the Luxembourg attack could be easily detected.  He added:  ""The attack relies on the use of public information. We can use that public information to detect such attacks.""  While TorBan doesn't prevent the attack, Kristov pointed out, it can serve as a useful warning system. He said preventing an attack would fall to the bitcoin core developers.  Pustogarov, a co-author of the Luxembourg paper, previously told CoinDesk that the attack could indeed be easily monitored. He welcomed Atlas' work with TorBan, noting that it contributed to a better understanding of the degree anonymity afforded by bitcoin use.  ""I can only encourage it. It is a small project designed to detect a very specific attack. But many small projects like this will finally create the big picture,"" he said.  User identities important for attacks  Painting a clearer picture of anonymity and privacy issues in bitcoin is just what Atlas hopes to achieve with TorBan, which is just one of the programmes running under the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project banner. That's a loose grouping of six software developers working on bitcoin and privacy matters.  Other Open Bitcoin Privacy Project efforts include CoinJoin Sudoku, which evaluates the privacy levels of Blockchain's mixing service SharedCoin, and Open Bitcoin Privacy Library, a framework for analysing privacy on the blockchain.  Atlas underlined the imminent danger of ignoring privacy issues in the bitcoin economy. He said that even though the Luxembourg attack couldn't steal a victim's funds, instead only potentially de-anonymising a bitcoin user, it could still play an important role in a malicious actor's arsenal.  ""Every hacker in the world ... builds a profile of their target first. There's an information gathering phase for anyone doing this kind of security work. I think bitcoin privacy is not well protected at the moment; information about where people's assets are and how much they have is really useful information,"" he said.

42426156,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQPh,1415719447,Think Tank: Blockchain Could be 'Economic Layer' for the Web,"The Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies (IEET) has published a brief article advocating the use of blockchain technology.  In the article, the IEET describes the blockchain as next-generation information technology with many potential upsides in a number of fields beyond digital currencies.  The IEET made a clear distinction between 'bitcoin 1.0' (currency) and other emerging technologies, classified as 'bitcoin 2.0' (contracts) and 'bitcoin 3.0' (beyond currency and finance) applications of blockchain technology.  More than just a currency  IEET  affiliate scholar Melanie Swan said the currently developing models of bitcoin and blockchain technology are “not the final paradigm”, as they are plagued by problematic flaws. However, she pointed out that decentralised models in general could have a pronounced impact on technology and society.  Swan said:  “Bitcoin and blockchain technology is much more than a digital currency, the blockchain is an information technology, potentially on the order of the Internet (‘the next Internet’), but even more pervasive and quickly-configuring.”  She described blockchain technology as one of the first identifiable large implementations of decentralisation models.  Looking at the bigger picture, Swan argued that decentralised models have the potential to “reorganise all manner of human activity” due to their ability to provide frictionless and trustless interaction between people and technology.  “The blockchain (decentralised network coordination technology) could emerge as a fundamental infrastructure element in the model to scale humanity to its next levels of orders-of-magnitude-larger progress,” she said.  Connecting the world  Swan pointed out that new computing paradigms usually arise once a decade. Mainframes were complemented by PCs in the ’80s, which were revolutionised by the Internet in the ’90s, followed by mobile devices and social networks in the 2000s.  The fifth paradigm, according to Swan, could be described as the ‘connected world’ – a future marked by wearables, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and smart homes, cars and cities – all backed by blockchain technology.  The IEET is not the first organisation to examine the potential uses of blockchain technology in the emerging field of IoT. Tech heavyweight IBM is also looking similar possibilities, along with German conglomerate Bosch, which is examining ways of monetising IoT with blockchain-derived technologies.  This is how the IEET described its vision of the 'connected world' paradigm:  “Paradigm 5 functionality could be the experience of a continuously-connected seamless physical-world multi-device computing layer, with a blockchain technology overlay for payments, and not just payments, but micropayments, decentralized exchange, token earning and spending, digital asset invocation and transfer, and smart contract issuance and execution; all as the economic layer the web never had.”  Apple Pay  was described as a “critical intermediary step” in moving to a full-fledged cryptocurrency world, in which the blockchain will serve as the seamless economic layer for the web.  Promoting new technologies  The IEET has been promoting new technologies and looking at their social implications for more than a decade.  The institute is a 501(c)3 non-profit organisation based in the US and was formed as an offshoot of Humanity+ – an international organisation that advocates the ethical use of emerging technologies to enhance human capacities.  Over the years, the IEET has had the occasional controversy, with some observers and authors criticising some its views as being transhumanist, a movement that is advocated by Humanity+. The IEET maintains that while some of its fellows have transhumanist views, others do not.  As for Swan, she is a principal of the MS Futures Group, a futurist, philosopher and options trader. She was director of research at telco consultancy RHK/Ovum and she previously held management and finance positions at JP Morgan, Fidelity, iPass and Arthur Andersen.

42426155,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQTh,1415701383,New Zealand Central Bank 'Not Threatened' by Bitcoin's Rise,"The deputy governor of New Zealand's Reserve Bank (RBNZ) has said the institution is ""not threatened"" by the rise of bitcoin and digital currencies.  According to a report in stuff.co.nz, deputy governor Grant Spencer made the comments this morning at Payments NZ, a two-day international payments industry conference in Auckland.  Spencer's comments are in contrast to those of other central bank representatives over the course of this year, most of which have concerned warnings of bitcoin's investment risk and/or lack of legal tender status.  ""I do not doubt that future digital currencies will become more realistic substitutes for cash,"" he said, also mentioning that, so far, bitcoin seems to ""behave more like a commodity than a currency"".  Of greater concern to the deputy governor were new players' involvement and security in the electronic payments industry in general, whether cryptocurrency-related or not.  The past 30 years have seen payments move from being primarily cash and cheques to more contactless, online and mobile phone-based systems.  Increased participation and new technologies brought with them increased operational risks, Spencer added, which could be disruptive to the economy. The general payments industry would have to manage these risks while still nurturing innovation and efficiency.  'Non-instrusive' regulation  The RBNZ preferred a ""non-intrusive"" and ""low-key"" regulatory approach to digital currencies, Spencer said, as opposed to some foreign central banks which had strengthened their regimes lately.  The central banks of both New Zealand and neighboring Australia did issue mild cautions about bitcoin in December last year, but at the same time described the technology as interesting.  Then in July this year, RBNZ deputy governor and head of operations Geoff Bascand described digital currencies as a ""challenge to the form and provenance"" of money that could supplant cash, despite some problems with price volatility.  New Zealand is often noted for having one of the world's most liberal economies, usually placing in the top five of the world Index of Economic Freedom along with Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and Switzerland.  Notably, from 29th–30th November, the country will host its first bitcoin conference, Bitcoin South, in the resort town of Queenstown.

42426160,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIjQXh,1415697601,DocuSign Founder Sees Blockchain Tech Potential in Identity Management,"Digital signature company DocuSign might have little to do with bitcoin at first glance. The firm's business is replacing ink signatures on paper with its own electronic version.  But the audience listening to DocuSign founder Tom Gonser at Web Summit in Dublin last week might have been forgiven for thinking they'd stumbled onto a sermon about the benefits of the blockchain.  Gonser ran through the complexities of identity and contract management in a digital age, pointing out that different jurisdictions had very different ideas of what constituted a valid contract. He stood on stage in Dublin and waved a $5 bill at the audience, saying:  ""This is a contract ... I'll give this bill to whoever wants it. But you have to go to a pub and try to buy a beer with it. You'll have a hard time, because they'll say no, I need to take euros.""  In a bitcoin sermon, this is where the blockchain and decentralisation comes in. Instead, Gonser's talk continued with the credit card companies – Visa, and MasterCard – solving the problem of converting cash in different jurisdictions by ""hiding"" the transactions behind a single credit card, which they issued.  Blockchain a 'sea change'  Gonser, who serves as chief strategy officer at DocuSign, isn't touting the bitcoin protocol and its open ledger as a solution for his company – but it may only be a matter of time.  He told CoinDesk that his firm's research labs are experimenting with the technology underpinning bitcoin, because of the chance that it might uncover ways of working on digital identity that are ""fundamentally better"".  ""Bitcoin is definitely something to watch ... it does represent something that's a sea change in how transactions can be tracked and audited,"" Gonser said.  Gonser also extolled the decentralised nature of distributed ledgers in identity management systems of the future. He gave the example of personal medical records, which are held by a number of different institutions, depending on the jurisdiction a patient is located in.  ""No one actually owns their [records]. I have probably 10, but I've never seen mine. It's the hospital – I don't know where it is. But it needs to be mine, it needs to be something I store,"" he said.  Gonser said distributed networks that make use of the blockchain, then, could be the solution for digital identity systems of the future, explaining:  ""The notion of empowered individuals in the digital world, creating a strong identity to make their life have less friction ... to the extent bitcoin represents this decentralised framework, it's very much in line with my thinking of how identity evolves.""  Thinking about identity's evolution is something Gonser has spent plenty of time on over the years. He started DocuSign more than 10 years ago after leaving NetUpdate, a mortgage transaction platform that he also founded.  As of today, DocuSign has raised $125m in funding as it goes head-to-head giants like Adobe, with its EchoSign platform. The company is valued at $1.6bn, according to estimates reported by the Wall Street Journal.  DocuSign claims 48 million customers and a rapidly growing headcount of more than 650 people last year. Its customer base is perhaps the most interesting thing about it: it counts big names in the financial world including Bank of America and Visa, which is also an investor in the firm, as customers.  Governments and digital standards  Gonser recounts how governments today are still liable to reject the established digital signature standard called X.509, first issued in 1988, in favour of their own homegrown solutions.  ""When we go to a country that has a specific type of signature technology, they can just say, we don't care. We want you to use this one,"" he said.  For bitcoin, the challenge is even tougher, Gonser said. While X.509 also relies on encryption, like the bitcoin protocol, it differs from bitcoin in that it works on a centralised 'hierarchical' model, where certifying authorities vouch for a document's authenticity.  ""Everybody has pretty much agreed on the X.509 standard ... it's been around for a long time. There's no reason blockchain technology couldn't also be adopted. It just takes governments a long time to do things.""  While Gonser is a believer in the potential of the Bitcoin protocol, he said it is some way off mass adoption.  ""If the federal government said, if your identity is backed as a bitcoin element, then sure. But that's just a long way off ... [the technology] is just very primal now,"" he said.  But if one of DocuSign's big customers started asking for bitcoin integration, Gonser said he wouldn't hesitate to get his firm on the blockchain.  ""From our perspective, it's pretty cool technology. But it's a small piece of the entire puzzle. The catalyst for us is if some customer said we would like to use [bitcoin] behind the signature. It wouldn't be very hard for us to do that,"" he said.
