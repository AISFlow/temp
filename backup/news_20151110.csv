42378371,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1o5,1447194259,Bitcoin Price Drops 13% to Fall Below $350,"The price of bitcoin on the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index fell more than 13% today to reach a seven-day low of $329.12.  At press time, bitcoin was trading at an average of $332.89 across major USD bitcoin exchanges, a 13.16% decline from the day’s opening of $380.04.  The day’s most rapid decline began at 20:15 UTC before falling abruptly one hour later.  Similar price movements were observed on the CoinDesk CNY Bitcoin Price Index, which at press time, indicated prices had fallen more than 12% across major China-based exchanges including BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin.  Data suggests both USD and CNY markets are now moving in tandem, as prices saw the most notable downward movement at 21:25 UTC. The value of bitcoin was still higher on CNY exchanges, where one bitcoin was trading for around $344 at press time.  The declines follow a US government auction of roughly 44,000 BTC last Thursday and come amid increasing reports that last week’s price increases were driven by MMM Global, a pyramid scheme that has captured the attention of The Financial Times and its coverage of market movements.  According to the FT, MMM ringleader Sergey Mavrodi has claimed credit for the price increase due to the use of bitcoin in transactions for MMM-China, where bitcoin is the only payment method offered to users.  The connection has been further established by public statements from executives of major China-based bitcoin trading firms, though blockchain evidence of this impact has yet to conclusively validate the claims.  CoinDesk has reached out to blockchain analysis firms for more information on last week’s price movements, though no further details had been provided as of press time.  At publication, the price was also down roughly $30 year-over-year, as bitcoin opened at $366.99 on 11th November, 2014.

42378363,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1e1,1447191570,Report: Blockchain Could Disrupt Capital Markets Within Decade,"Blockchain technology is set to disrupt existing financial business models within the next five to 10 years, according to a new report by global capital markets consulting firm GreySpark Partners.  Entitled ""The Blockchain: Capital Markets Use Cases"", the report notes that distributed ledger technology (abbreviated as DLT) has the potential to reduce operational costs and counterparty and settlement risk, while also impacting payments and remittances, among other financial sectors.  Other topics discussed in the report included digitised financial instruments; regulatory reporting; clearing and settlement; reconciliation and smart contracts.  Overall, the report spoke broadly about the potential for the blockchain to impact these areas, noting:  ""Since the blockchain is a proof-of-record of agreed transactions and contracts, the technology can support any sort of transaction of value. This functionality poses a number of pertinent use cases within capital markets. For example, in the near future, blockchain-applied solutions could used to bridge the gap between distributed ledger systems and the world of mainstream financial infrastructure.""  The report goes on to state that despite this potential and cost-saving advantages, distributed ledgers are only used by a ""handful"" of major financial institutions today.  Adopting the blockchain  While speaking generally about the technology's potential, the report also speculates as to how it could reach more widespread adoption.  Toward this goal, the authors explain, most blockchain startups are currently focused on the development of ledger-agnostic business models:  ""Blockchain-based solutions are fundamentally designed to create new financial markets infrastructures that, in terms of the functionality, would initially replicate existing markets infrastructure and then eventually expand on it by reducing its complexity at the margins to become suited to a distributed or shared ledger network.""  As a result, it adds, there is tension between startups which have pivoted from bitcoin-orientated business models into the financial markets and the existing mainstream industry providers.  ""Currently, there is a bifurcated outlook on the future of DLT and its relationship with existing financial markets ways and means of processing data,"" it continues.  Although mainstream capital markets participants are eager to adopt such solutions, there is currently ""a misalignment of imperatives"", says the report, adding that the technology's intrinsic problems must be resolved first before widespread adoption is achieved.  ""For example, a fundamental problem associated with DLT is the issue of transaction throughput capacity. While some blockchain initiatives developed blockchain appliances that have the ability to process a vast amount of transactions in near real-time, they do so at some degree of cost.""  The report finally argues that blockchain technology will become a ""cross-industry solution"" if and when it meets all of the capital markets industry's requirements.

42378354,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1Sh,1447179947,Overstock Spent Over $3 Million on Blockchain Projects in Q3,"Overstock spent $3.2m on its blockchain securities initiative over the past three months, according to the online retail firm’s latest quarterly results.  The report, published yesterday, shows that the firm may spend as much as $8m developing Medici, its subsidiary created for its exploration into the technology, of which blockchain trading platform tØ is one effort.  In a letter to shareholders, CEO Patrick Byrne said that those expenditures could be higher when accounting for various cost factors.  He wrote:  ""The direct costs of our Medici efforts this year will be in the neighborhood of $8m (and when you add shared overhead, services provided by dual-tasked employees and load factor, the real cost this year is significantly greater).""  Byrne suggested that the firm may be looking to spin out its blockchain trading arm into a venture separate from Overstock's broader e-commerce infrastructure.  “For obvious reasons I do not believe that this enterprise can be co-managed with our online retailing business, and in that regard am aggressively exploring alternatives with an eye to maximizing shareholder value,” Byrne wrote.  In the note, Byrne also pointed to the company’s August acquisition of Wall Street brokerage SpeedRoute as a vehicle for pushing its blockchain-based trading platform. The company said that it expects to make further investments and acquisitions related to Medici.  The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42378351,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1RR,1447177393,US Prosecutors Unseal New Charges Against Bitcoin Exchange Operator,"A new indictment has been filed against Anthony Murgio, the former operator of bitcoin exchange Coin.mx, months after charges were first submitted by the US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York.  Court documents obtained by CoinDesk detail seven charges against Murgio, who was arrested in July alongside co-operator Yuri Lebedev and charged with the unlawful operation of a money transmission business as well as money laundering. Murgio later posted $100,000 bail.  As in the original indictment, Murgio is accused of operating a vast conspiracy for the unlawful operation of Coin.mx in the new superseding indictment. Key to the scheme was falsely representing the firm as a members-only “Collectors Club” organization. Murgio also allegedly miscoded credit card transactions in order to hide the fact that bitcoins were being purchased.  According to the filing, customers were induced to misleading their banks:  “Also in furtherance of their unlawful Coin.mx scheme, Murgio and his co-conspirators knowingly instructed customers of Coin.mx to lie to banks about the bitcoin exchange transactions the customers were executing with Coin.mx, and to state falsely that they were for the exchange of collectible items, and not for bitcoins.""  Later, the exchange acquired control of a New Jersey-based credit union in order to facilitate transactions.  The new charges, which according to the US Attorney’s Office were filed as a result of its continuing investigation, come in tandem with charges against three other individuals: Gery Shalon, Joshua Aaron and Ziv Orenstein.  The three stand accused of money laundering, computer hacking and securities fraud charges. Coin.mx, according to the US government, was used as a vehicle for laundering illicit funds.  In addition to being accused of aiding the unlicensed operation of Coin.mx, the three allegedly orchestrated a web of digital criminal activity dating back to 2012 that involved a cyberattack on JPMorgan Chase in 2014, as well as attacks against other financial institutions.  The indictment alleges a global infrastructure of crime, including illicit gambling sites, money laundering channels and the theft of data from at least a hundred million individuals over a multi-year period.  Though the bank was not directly named in today’s filing, JPMorgan confirmed the breach in a statement to Bloomberg News. Bloomberg also reported that Wall Street financial information service Dow Jones & Co was also targeted.  Orenstein and Shalon, the latter of whom is listed in the federal indictment as an owner of Coin.mx, were arrested in Israel, according to a report by Israel Hayom.  The government is seeking asset forfeitures of the four defendants. US Attorney Preet Bharara will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. local time. The agency was not immediately available for comment.

42378359,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1bV,1447176039,Medical Records Project Wins Top Prize at Blockchain Hackathon,"MedVault, a proof-of-concept that would allow patients to record medical information on the bitcoin blockchain, won €5,000 in prize money at the Blockchain Hackathon this weekend.  The event  – held in Ireland and sponsored by Fidelity Investments, Deloitte and Citi – saw approximately 150 participants pitch ideas, form teams and build on concepts in just 50 hours.  Graham Rhodes, a MedVault developer, indicated that the project was able to separate from the competition because of its use of the blockchain to ""anonymize"" medical records.    Rhodes told CoinDesk:      ""[We're] giving the patients control over their own medical records and the decision to make certain aspects public or private, while still being stored in a distributed global manner.""              The application can be seen as one of a growing number of both formal and informal projects that aim to use the bitcoin blockchain as a secure database for recordkeeping.    Under the hood  Though only a proof of concept, Rhodes indicated that the concept advanced toward discussions on user experience.  Patients using a fully developed product, Rhodes said, would be provided with a QR code of their public key or patient identifier, which a doctor could then use to access their medical records.  ""The vision here was that if a patient is on holiday skiing, crashes into a tree and gets knocked out, [the patient has] a key fob or another way to access their patient identifier, and doctors can immediately view their medical records,"" he continued.    On the tech side, MedVault uses digital asset startup Colu's platform, leveraging its software development kit to avoid ""bloating"" the bitcoin blockchain.      ""As the blockchain can only store so much information, Colu leverages the colored coin protocol and the BitTorrent network to store the digital asset and medical record in a verifiable way,"" added Rhodes.    Although still undecided about what the prize money will be used for, Rhodes suggested that it may be sensible to invest the funds into developing the product:  ""With the attention it seems blockchain has been receiving lately, I feel like it would definitely be worth investing the money in it [the concept].""

42378369,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1kJ,1447169493,SEC Chief Urges Caution But Sees Blockchain Potential,"Commissioner Kara Stein, the highest-ranking official at the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a new warning about the hype surrounding blockchain technology and distributed ledgers.  As part of a Harvard Law School event held yesterday, Stein broadly discussed new innovations affecting US capital markets, naming the blockchain as a specific emerging technology that could impact the sector.  In her remarks, Stein, who was appointed to the position by President Barack Obama in 2013, commented on the increasing attention the technology has received of late. Further, she noted the blockchain’s relationship to bitcoin and listed a series of use cases for which the tech is currently being explored, naming areas including clearing and settlement, payment processing and loan transactions.  While acknowledging that such applications could increase quality and trust in the financial system, Stein stopped short of endorsing the technology, telling the audience:  ""While I am not advocating for the adoption or effectiveness of blockchain technology, it appears to offer potential. One can imagine a world in which securities lending, repo and margin financing are all traceable through blockchain’s transparent and open approach to tracking transactions.""  Stein went on to theorize that public ledgers could one day yield benefits for government regulators, who would be able to better monitor “systemic risk” in financial markets.  However, Stein cautioned that these ideas are “still in their infancy”, adding that she believes the technology will need to deliver on its hype through a ""constant evaluation"" by regulators, academics and capital markets participants.  ""Can [the blockchain] be used to enhance the quality of our markets and investor protection? Or, is there a way it could be used to monopolize markets or undermine competition? How should this technology be best deployed? Should it be run via a public-private partnership, somewhat like the Internet?"" Stein asked.  She added that she believes US regulators should be watching developments in the technology closely, adding:  ""If the market begins to move toward blockchain technology, regulators need to be in a position to lead, harnessing its benefits and responding quickly to potential weaknesses.""  The remarks are among the first from the US government agency, which oversees federal securities laws, on the subject of bitcoin or blockchain technology, and come amid an increase in startups seeking to appeal to, or restructure their services for, enterprise financial institutions.  To date, the SEC has primarily been active in the industry through infrequent enforcement actions taken against defunct startups including GAW Miners and Sand Hill Exchange, among others.

42378362,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7i1cl,1447155035,Coinbase Seeking to Expand Bitcoin Services to Latin America,"Coinbase is seeking to expand its bitcoin buying and selling services to new Asian and Latin American markets in 2016.  In interview at Money20/20, product manager Adam White indicated that the startup, which has so far raised more than $106m in venture funding, aims to be operational in 40 countries next year, and that these regions would be primary areas of focus.  In September, Coinbase announced its first launch in Asia with an expansion to Singapore, though it has yet to make its services available in Latin America.  White said new announcements could come as soon as December or January, and that news was dependant on Coinbase’s ability to meet local regulatory compliance.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We continue to look at Coinbase as a infrastructure, providing programmatic access to buying and selling.""  Elsewhere, White suggested that Coinbase is not looking to launch a private blockchain product for enterprise businesses, as its US competitor itBit did in August.  White said Coinbase was likely to continue to emphasize strategic partnerships with consumer-facing payments companies, as well as firms that have made public investments in the startup.  Coinbase investors include BBVA Ventures, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and USAA, the latter of which recently launched a pilot program that made select Coinbase services available to customers.  The expansion estimate is the latest for the San Francisco company, which had made international expansion a cornerstone of its goals for 2015.  At the time of Coinbase’s $75m Series C round, announced in January, CEO Brian Armstrong forecasted that the company could be available in as many as 30 countries by the year’s end.  Today, Coinbase is available in 32 countries.

According to the agency, the goal of the event was to unite the private and public sector in discussions centered on strategies for limiting cybercrime perpetrated with the emerging technologies.  The unpublicized event, organized by the DOJ’s Digital Currency Task Force and held at the Federal Reserve Bank in San Francisco, saw 175 industry participants engage in panel discussions that sought to emphasize its core theme from the point of view of entrepreneurs, law enforcement officials and regulators.  Though no participants were named in formal release, Twitter images from the event show speakers included Xapo CEO Wences Casares, Coinbase founder Fred Ehrsam and Ripple CEO Chris Larsen, among others.  In remarks, US Attorney Brian J Stretch positioned the event as one that sought to forge a common ground between representatives of the government and the distributed financial technology sector:  “As emerging technologies such as digital currency and blockchains expand into new and legitimate applications, it becomes all the more critical for industry leaders and government agencies to share insights and perspectives in order to combat the illicit use of these technologies.”  Further addressing the need for dialogue was FinCEN Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery, who noted that despite her department’s early efforts to understand the industry, continued discussions are needed due to the evolving nature of the technology.  “We only opened the door for the hundreds of other questions beyond our anti-money laundering perspective,” Calvery said.  The event was previously hinted at by DOJ Digital Currency Crimes Coordinator Kathryn Haun in an interview with CoinDesk in September in which she spoke at length about the multi-agency task force and its goals.  At the time, Haun sought to stress that the US government was broadly seeking to engage the digital currency and blockchain industry in discussions that would provide clarity on key issues for all ecosystem participants.
