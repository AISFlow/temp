These smaller investors have less purchasing power but with so many new entrants into the market following the 2020-2021 bull market, their collective purchasing power has grown alongside the total amount they hold. Retail Investors Hold 17% Of Supply Over the last few years, bitcoin addresses holding less than 10 BTC on their balances have been picking up more BTC supply. Recent data from on-chain data aggregator Glassnode shows that these small investors now hold 17% of the total BTC supply. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Welcomes 10,000 New Holders, Can SHIB Keep Up The Momentum? This subset of investors has grown by almost 50% in the last two years from around 12% to 17.3%, and a 0.5% increase in the last 30 days as data from Santiment shows the percentage of supply held by addresses holding between 0.001-10 BTC was sitting at 16.8% on Nov. 1, 2022. Interestingly, this BTC holder base had seen a significant decline at the start of November. This coincides with the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange, taking a good number of investor coins down with it. However, the recovery has been swift and retail holders are back to building their balances back up. Retail holders held less than 17% of supply on Nov. 1 | Source: Santiment The increase in retail investor numbers follows the same patterns as previous bull markets such as the 2017 bull market. This shines through in the fact that at the start of 2021, these small holders only account for 13.9% of all BTC supply. Is This Good News For Bitcoin? The accelerated adoption rate has been good news for bitcoin and was one of the main drivers behind the 2021 bull market. Looking back, the rise in retail holder numbers has always been good news for the digital asset. It propels the adoption of the cryptocurrency, as well as helps to distribute the total supply to more holders. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Falls Below Critical Point, Why There Is More Pain To Come Currently, the vast majority of BTC’s supply is still being controlled by large.

The ‘crypto winter’ is in full bloom, so the next bull market could still be another year away. Given this, adoption will likely help sustain the current price trend rather than trigger a rally. Nevertheless, the steady rise in wallets holding less than 10 BTC shows more interest from the broader investor community. It also marks significant accumulation among smaller investors during this time.

6118070,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513287,1671663615,"SAND Experiences Increased Selling, But Traders Should Short At This Level","SAND, the SandBox, has been free-falling since the month of August. The coin has registered a severe decline in demand, which has caused the crypto to lose further value. The asset has pierced through various support levels over the past few months. It lost 2.2% of its value in the last 24 hours. Over the past week, the coin has depreciated in double digits, which has caused the coin to reach a multi-month low on the chart. The technical outlook displayed that the coin has received very little demand, and the buyers have exited the market. The consistent fall in demand can be attributed to major market movers faltering on their respective charts. Support from the broader market remains crucial for The Sandbox (SAND) to recover. The technical outlook still points to the coin losing further value, which indicates that sellers can liquidate the asset and purchase it when it dips to sell it again when the value rises. The trading volume in Sandbox declined, indicating that the bears were in charge of the market. Related Reading: XRP Accumulation: Key Sharks And Whales Group Hits All-Time High Holdings SAND Price Analysis: One-Day Chart The coin was exchanging hands at $0.43 at the time of writing. SAND has been unable to maintain a price above $0.50 since the coin lost the $0.70 price. If The SandBox price stood above the $0.50 level, then there was a chance that the coin could propel the price further. Presently, the immediate resistance for the asset stands at $0.53. The price of crypto will rally if it breaks above $0.53. Conversely, if the altcoin dips, the first fall would be to $0.40 and then to $0.36. The zone between the $0.40 and the $0.30 can prove beneficial to traders as that would present a shorting opportunity. The amount of SAND traded in the last session was low, leading to increased sales. Technical Analysis SAND did not recover from the declining buying pressure throughout the month of December. The asset was now in the oversold zone. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) was at the 20 mark, which is undervalued territory. This indicated that the bears were still dominating. Usually, a visit to the oversold zone means that the price will bounce off to the upside. The asset price fell below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. The other technical indicators also pointed towards the coin dipping, confirming that sellers could now benefit. The Directional Movement Index (DMI) was negative as the -DI line was above the +DI line; the indicator detects the price direction and momentum in the market. The Average Directional Index (ADX) was slightly above the 20-mark, which meant the price momentum for the asset was still low. The Parabolic SAR indicates the asset trend; the indicator was above the price candlestick, which meant that the coin depicted a downtrend.

""Today the Foreign Minister, who is the Minister responsible for the Extradition Act, signed the Warrant of Surrender for Sam Bankman Fried. This allows the extradition of the subject to the United States of America,"" a statement said.  Bankman-Fried expressed his intent to fight extradition during his first hearing after being arrested. He reportedly changed his mind within days of being incarcerated after a judge denied him bail. He was arrested on Dec. 12, 2022, after U.S. prosecutors indicted him on eight different charges, including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and violating campaign finance laws.  Read more: Inside Sam Bankman-Fried's First Bahamas Court Hearing After His Arrest  ""The United States requested that a provisional arrest warrant be issued for SBF in anticipation of his extradition pursuant to an extradition Treaty between the two nations.

""The Bahamas has determined that the provisional arrest, and subsequent written consent by SBF to be extradited without formal extradition proceedings satisfies the requirements of the Treaty and our nation's Extradition Act.""  Bankman-Fried reportedly changed his mind about fighting extradition over the weekend, but reports from his first court hearing this week suggest his local attorney was unaware of this decision.  Bankman-Fried's former empire collapsed last month after a CoinDesk report revealed that Alameda Research and FTX, a trading desk and crypto exchange respectively, had unusually close financial ties.  Federal prosecutors and regulatory agencies – as well as FTX's new CEO, John J. Ray III – have since alleged that FTX commingled customer and corporate funds.  In bankruptcy filings and hearings, FTX's new management claimed the company had about $1 billion, far less than the $10+ billion owed to its creditors.

42411281,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMfrN,1671661402,How Regenerative Finance Is Bringing Sustainability to Crypto,"As 2022 draws to a close, few would look back on our nascent industry and say it has lived up to its potential. Crypto began as a revolution in every sense of the word: a way to democratize access to finance and a revolution against the current financial system and its attendant exploitations and issues. Fast forward to today, though, and what we’re seeing is an ecosystem that failed to focus on its core promises and instead remains largely separate from the real world and is relearning many of the lessons traditional finance learned years ago.  We’ve lost sight in recent years of the true innovation of blockchain and smart contracts and have gotten caught up in Ponzi-economics and celebrity hype trains. Businesses and individuals in the space have fallen prey to the “number go up” mindset, in which that is the only goal. Nothing demonstrates this more than the catastrophic collapse of FTX.  It is evident now more than ever that the businesses built on top of decentralized finance (DeFi) primitives need to focus on adding tangible and sustainable value. As we reset and reorient our focus, Web3 will embrace the challenge of tackling the toughest real world issues by creating incentives that make it economically advantageous to do so. And that’s where ReFi comes in.  Phil Fogel is the chief blockchain officer at Flowcarbon, an ecosystem focused on making carbon markets accessible and transparent, as well as mobilizing new technology and communities to fight climate change. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 outlook.  Why ReFi?  Any DeFi product that is to succeed in this new world must solve for two fundamental principles: the creation of new value and new institutional use cases. Regenerative finance is uniquely positioned to address both of these concerns. Through understanding where ReFi comes from it’s easier to grasp how. ReFi is the combination of two distinct disciplines: regenerative economics, in which the focus is on balanced, circulatory flows of capital that integrate both positive and negative externalities while taking care of people and the commons; and decentralized finance, which aims to remove opaque, centralized intermediaries to democratize both the access to financial services and the management of the financial system itself.  The existing mechanics that attempt to create a regenerative economy are not working. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) measures are broken and do not align with financial incentives. ESG investments have both statistically underperformed the market and lack transparency, as shown in an HBS study and an investigation into Goldman Sachs ESG funds. In order to harness the rising demand for a new regenerative economy, we need to turn toward emergent technologies such as DeFi. Vinay Gupta said it best when he said that “crypto wins by solving problems that nobody else can solve, profitably.” This leads to the core thesis of ReFi: We can create mechanisms for both ordinary people and corporations that incentivize the regeneration of environments and communities in a way that is palatable to governments and superior to existing non-crypto solutions.  The ReFi space is poised to explode in 2023.  Read more: ReFi Is Going Mainstream  It all starts with carbon  And no place is better suited and more ready for its effects than the voluntary carbon market. The VCM has long been plagued by issues of accessibility and quality. It is nearly impossible for an individual to get an account at one of the major carbon registry bodies, preventing them from even participating in the market. The market is also illiquid and opaque. Spot prices are not readily available and carbon offset units (COU) transactions typically happen over the counter through a web of brokers and middlemen.  All in all, the quality of carbon projects is a hotly contested issue. There are many instances of projects overestimating emissions reductions; additionally, permanence and leakage are notoriously difficult to measure.  To date, various ReFi projects have emerged to address these issues, from the angle of infrastructure for tokenized credits, protocols for verifying carbon project data and so many others. By operating in Web3, different actors can address different parts of all sorts of problems in an interoperable and permissionless way, without contending with the many gatekeepers and roadblocks historically involved.  All existing ReFi projects are beginning to interact with each other, and this ecosystem is poised to explode in a way that will happen much faster thanks to Web3. With more of an emphasis than ever on sustainable practices in virtually every sector in the world, ReFi-centered growth will be exponential, and 2023 will be the year we look back on as the time when it all took off.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Phil Fogel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/21/phil-fogel-regenerative-finance-crypto-sustainability-crypto-2023,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/27ae889f8b39b8fd6a6f61b7b318ad26ca58904f-5184x3888.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413373,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8XIE,1671661031,Inside Core Scientific’s Prearranged Bankruptcy,"The situation is “much closer to Hertz and Ford and Delta than FTX,” Core Scientific (CORZ) Chief Mining Officer Russell Cann told CoinDesk, explaining that he expects the company will emerge stronger from the reorganization process.  Operating its own bitcoin (BTC) mining rigs and serving as a host for others, Core Scientific accounts for about 10% of the entire hashrate of the Bitcoin network, with computing power of nearly 25 exahash/second (EH/s). According to its Twitter, Core Scientific mines about 50 bitcoin per day for itself, and its most recent monthly update shows 1,295 bitcoin mined in October.  Coming after months of turmoil for the crypto mining industry, which has been squeezed between low prices hurting revenue and higher energy costs lifting expenses, Wednesday’s Chapter 11 filing wasn’t a surprise. CORZ shares had already lost about 99% of their value over the past year, and the company had warned of a possible bankruptcy two months ago.  Cann told CoinDesk that, operationally, it’s business as usual at the company, but the bankruptcy filing will now allow for “the restructure of the balance sheet.”  Read more: Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Files for Bankruptcy, Expects Support From Some Debt Holders  Operations  Most of Core Scientific’s customers that already have machines or contracts with the company’s hosting business won’t be affected by the bankruptcy, said Cann. The company, however, is considering selling two of its facilities, said Cann, but that was under consideration before the bankruptcy. The two sites are still under development and house none of their own machines, nor do they pertain to any existing hosting contracts, he said.  Core Scientific has no plans to sell mining machines, unless in the normal course of business.  As for Celsius Mining – Core Scientific’s largest hosting client and also going through a Chapter 11 restructuring with its parent, Celsius Network – Cann said the bankruptcy courts might get involved in their ongoing disagreement.  Celsius Mining has claimed that Core Scientific violated the terms of bankruptcy by failing to host some of its machines and trying to pass through increased electricity costs. Core Scientific, meanwhile, has been routinely passing on increased energy charges to its hosting clients.  The two sites that Core Scientific might be selling are in Muskogee, Oklahoma, and Barstow, Texas, that had been hoped to be operational in 2023, said Cann. “If anyone wants to turn on machines in 2023, their best shot is a site that Core has been working on for 18 to 24 months,” he said.  Read more: A Huge Glut of Bitcoin Mining Rigs Is Sitting Unused in Boxes  The restructuring plan  Core Scientific is in a prearranged bankruptcy, as opposed to a prepackaged or a free fall process, the chief mining officer said. That means that the company has agreement from a majority of debt holders, but not all. Bankruptcy courts can sometimes be used to force those that are holdouts to comply with the plan.  One of the company’s largest unsecured creditors is investment bank B. Riley (RILY) – which earlier this week published a curious letter proposing a debt restructuring deal for Core Scientific. B. Riley is working closely with the miner, Cann said. The investment bank’s proposal required that all the equipment lenders had to agree to the plan, he added. “Since we're sitting here today, obviously, all the equipment lenders didn't agree,” Cann said.  B. Riley shares are lower by 8.6% on Wednesday despite a rising stock market.  According to the restructuring plan, the secured debt convertible noteholders will get equity. The current equity and unsecured holders will get warrants such that as the company grows they will get more shares, Cann explained.  The plan also involves about $75 million in debtor-in-possession credit facilities. In its letter, B. Riley estimated that $72 million would give Core Scientific two years of runway.  Industry reaction  “One can argue there is no major impact on the industry – Bitcoin network continues to operate [...] and new blocks are created every 10 minutes,” said Juri Bulovic, head of mining at mining company Foundry. The bankruptcy, he said, is a good reminder of the volatility of the market.  Foundry and CoinDesk share the same parent, Digital Currency Group.  Foundry CEO Mike Colyer said he “has no doubt that Core's team will manage to navigate this difficult time and come out of it stronger.”  At the same time, Colyer warned that “if you are caught taking on more risk at the wrong or unfortunate point in the bitcoin cycle, you may get wiped out – no matter how big or small you are, or how seasoned and experienced your team is.”  “Taking leverage to hodl isn’t a great idea in bitcoin mining, which seems so obvious but also shows how easy one can be blinded during the bull market,” said Wolfie Zhao, head of research at TheMinerMag, the data and research arm of mining consultancy BlocksBridge.  The bankruptcy filing might also send the share price of miners on a renewed downward trend. “This will be the first Chapter 11 of a publicly listed mining company, likely triggering a market wide sell off as investors derisk their portfolio by moving out of mining equities,” said Ethan Vera, chief operations officer at mining services firm Luxor.  The situation “will make lenders, especially TradFi [traditional finance] ones, rethink how they evaluate the credit of mining companies from treasury strategy perspective when negotiating loan deals in the future,” Zhao said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Eliza Gkritsi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/12/21/inside-core-scientifics-prearranged-bankruptcy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4838ef4103430d0eb462dcc854d4041b6690a5bf-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42413387,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8XUO,1671660467,Crypto Markets Today: Popsicle Heats Up as Bitcoin Stays Cold,"The native token of Popsicle Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) market-making and yield-earning protocol, is surging as the controversial yet prolific blockchain developer Daniele Sestagalli said he was returning to the project.  This article originally appeared in Crypto Markets Today, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Popsicle’s ICE token’s price jumped some 220% in the last 24 hours, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. The token currently is trading at 36 U.S. cents, only two days after hitting an all-time low of 9 cents.  Popsicle was part of a loose conglomerate of DeFi projects known as ""Frog Nation"" that were helmed by Sestagalli as recently as January, including Abracadabra.money, whose stablecoin was partly collateralized by the collapsed FTX exchange’s FTT token, and the since-failed Wonderland, a fork of OlympusDAO.  The sudden surge came after Sestagalli tweeted Wednesday that he was “focusing right now on rebuilding the OG Popsicle Finance,” breaking a four-month-long silence on Twitter.  Sestagalli, also known as Dani Sesta in crypto circles, garnered a cult following in crypto due to his community-based approach to building projects, CoinDesk wrote in January.  But his reputation took a hit earlier this year when influential crypto vigilante ZachXBT revealed that Sestagalli was working at Wonderland with an executive of the failed QuadrigaCX exchange, which allegedly defrauded investors of at least $190 million.  Token Roundup  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH): The largest cryptocurrency by market value looked remarkably stable Wednesday, trading around $16,780 and almost flat in the past 24 hours as traders wrestled with the uncertain market outlook for next year. ETH followed BTC’s trajectory, down 0.3% around $1,209. U.S. equities were a bit more buoyant: The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.  Waves (WAVES): The native token of decentralized blockchain dropped 5% to $1.51 on Wednesday and plunged by more than 40% over the past two weeks as Waves' founder Sasha Ivanov has asked crypto exchanges to deactivate futures markets tied to the WAVES token. The coin's slump has been attributed to the volatility of USDN, an algorithmic stablecoin that is designed to be pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar. The stablecoin is backed by the WAVES token and has de-pegged on multiple occasions this year.  dYdX (DYDX): The token price dropped over 14% to $1.18 as many investors are “front-running a huge supply unlock that begins in February,” Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, wrote in a Wednesday note.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Crypto Market Analysis: Bitcoin and Ether’s Flat Trajectory to Continue, Technical Indicators Suggest  By Glenn Williams Jr.  Momentum for both BTC and ETH remains in neutral territory, using the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) as a proxy for momentum. BTC’s current RSI is approximately 49.06 – a very middling level. RSI is a technical indicator that ranges from 1 to 100. Readings over 70 imply that an asset is potentially overbought, while readings under 30 imply that an asset is possibly oversold.  Searching BTC data back to 2015, and filtering for RSI levels between 49 and 50 shows 61 occurrences with an average gain of 2.2%, 30 days after the fact. For ETH, filtering for RSI levels between 47 and 49, showed 43 occurrences since 2017, with an average 30-day gain of 6.7%.  Applying those performance figures to current prices, results in prices of $17,144 for bitcoin and $1,291 for ether. This is far from earth-shattering, given where both have traded in the past. The results should not be viewed as predictive but can provide context as to where investors think prices may wind up.  Read the full technical take here.

42413382,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8XSW,1671660202,One of Crypto’s Favorite US Senators Drops Swan-Song Bill on Eve of Retirement,"Crypto ally U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) used one of his final days in office to send a last legislative message on regulating stablecoins.  The final stretch of the waning Congress hasn’t produced any crypto surprises, and the industry’s lobbyists have been standing down, but Toomey decided to introduce a bill as a guide for next year’s lawmakers who’ll be under pressure to do something about digital assets.  “I hope this framework lays the groundwork for my colleagues to pass legislation next year safeguarding customer funds without inhibiting innovation,” the retiring senator said in a statement that will likely be among his last as the final dozen days of the session wind to a close.  The retiring senator’s legislation, introduced Wednesday, would retain privacy for stablecoin transactions, set up the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency as a licenser of companies issuing payment stablecoins, let nonbank entities issue the tokens and clarify that stablecoin issuers that don’t offer interest wouldn’t have to worry about securities laws.  It would also require the digital tokens – designed to maintain a steady value by pegging to an asset such as the dollar – be fully backed by reserves, and it nods toward maintaining existing state-based supervision. But it’s Toomey’s second stablecoin bill this year. The first one didn’t produce a lot of results.  His new legislation is pointedly meant to keep the Federal Reserve away from this sector, avoiding what he termed a potential conflict of interest if the Fed is authorized to create a digital dollar in the future.  The latest bill might have packed more of a punch if Toomey’s fellow Republicans had seized the Senate majority in November’s election. But his party remains in the minority and Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is set to replace him as ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee. This swap may leave a vacuum for cryptocurrency advocacy in the Senate because Toomey was a staunch supporter of crypto innovation and Scott’s views remain unclear.

42413375,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8XMu,1671656873,Uniswap DAO Community Members Vote in Favor of New Governance Process,"Uniswap community members chose Wednesday to reform the voting process on the popular decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol in an effort to make it easier to change the way the system is governed.  The initial proposal, which opened to a vote last week, saw nearly 100% in favor of altering the governance structure within the ecosystem.  The biggest changes will see Uniswap reduce the number of off-chain ""snapshot votes"" that precede on-chain votes to one. Final governance votes – the on-chain votes that approve or reject a proposal – will remain the same.  While both kinds of votes require participants to contribute UNI, the native token of Uniswap, on-chain votes add data to the Ethereum blockchain, whereas off-chain votes poll community members on their initial stance towards a proposal.  Read more: On-Chain vs. Off-Chain Transactions: What’s the Difference?  Devin Walsh, director of the Uniswap Foundation, said the proposal seeks to address inefficiencies in the governance structure with changes such as increasing the quorum – or amount of UNI represented – for voting and reducing the number of votes to pass a proposal.  “The intention of the off-chain votes is to provide a signal to the community that there's consensus on a proposal,” Walsh told CoinDesk. “What we found is you only need one off-chain vote to achieve that benefit of a signal, and requiring the community to vote twice is redundant and unnecessary.”  The move to ease governance is part of an effort to empower community members to participate in the protocol’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). In August, Walsh and Head of Ops Kenneth Ng spearheaded efforts to establish the Uniswap Foundation, a body aiming to support developers within the ecosystem and streamline governance.  Uniswap is not alone in trying to facilitate a more frictionless DAO governance environment. Earlier this month, the creator behind Waves Blockchain said he would explore a new DAO governance structure to emphasize accountability within the protocol.  Walsh told CoinDesk that when a DAO establishes its voting structure it must “contemplate whether goals of its governance process are being reached, and be open to iterating upon the process to reach those goals.”",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | UNI,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/21/uniswap-dao-community-members-vote-in-favor-of-new-governance-process,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/55b1859d885cbd7527a0859c30a54b39248f9710-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407206,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJk5y,1671655829,"There's Less Money in Crypto, and That's a Good Thing","If there’s one big thing that the mainstream coverage has missed about the various collapses in the crypto space over the past year, it’s this:  The downfall of crypto had very little to do with crypto.  David Z. Morris is CoinDesk's chief insights columnist. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  Cryptocurrency is the application of blockchain technology to build uncensorable, open-access and immutable global shared ledgers – usually monetary ledgers. But the headline crimes and failures of 2023 were almost uniformly attempts to use financial engineering to turn the future value of those systems into present-day U.S. dollars.  Too often, the finance bros bet big, using the same kind of fragile, nested and interlocking leverage that led to the 2008 financial crisis. Other times they used outright fraud – and they did it off-chain, playing by no rules, with no transparency. They were mistaken for part of the cryptocurrency industry, but it would have been more accurate to think of them as hangers-on and freeloaders, redirecting genuine public interest in crypto to their various unsustainable games.  As in much of contemporary finance, the finance bros were extractive rather than additive. They were not builders, but instead a swarm of hatchling vampire squid, little would-be Goldmans frantically shoving their underdeveloped blood-funnels into anything that smelled like money.  The epic failures of these finance vampires, plus broader economic conditions, mean that 2023 in the crypto world will be a much different year than 2021 or 2022. Hedge fund gamblers and token-shilling hype men will be relegated to supporting roles, where they belong, as the shadowy super-coders who actually make crypto exist move back into the spotlight.  See also: Money Crypto Versus Tech Crypto | Opinion  But 2023 will also be different from previous “BUIDL eras,” during which huge squads of nerds were often set free to pursue whatever seemed cool to them. There will certainly still be some of that, but smart leaders will be pushing their teams much more firmly towards clearer goals: Building accessible and reliable front ends, for use cases with real-world demand, then (hopefully) generating revenue from users. The broad public now has a vague idea of what crypto is (for better or worse). The task now is finding out how to sell it as a tool rather than a speculative investment.  This will mean, among other things, less speculation on new tokens, particularly the tokens for new “layer 1” blockchains. In its place will be a relative increase in attention to services that leverage existing, trusted chains and ecosystems to build services with real demand that genuinely require the benefits of blockchains – cross-border fluidity, digital permanence, uncensorability and decentralized governance.  Betting on the future (but not building it)  This future, of course, assumes that the finance bros have been sufficiently embarrassed to feel some vague sense of humility, and that their marks have wised up a bit. Personally, I don’t think that task is quite accomplished. Like unruly dogs beholden to their animal spirits, institutional traders and speculators may still need their noses rubbed into the mess they’ve made. So, let’s do that.  Across many sectors of the economy, the 21st century role of finance has become catastrophically perverted. Rather than risking capital to generate long-term profit by building productive industries, the capital game has become about timing bubbles and picking narratives that will trick naïve investors (retail or otherwise) into becoming bag carriers. Meanwhile you, the pumper, head off to the White Lotus with the cash.  This isn’t a problem specific to crypto – especially not over the past three years. The litany of overbought, undercooked and sometimes just plain rotten companies rolls off the tongue: Clover Health (a 2020 Chamath SPAC joint on the verge of delisting), Meta Platforms (rebranded around an app with no users), Nikola (an electric vehicle fraud that raised $3.2 billion), Tesla (once pumped, now dumped), Theranos ($700 million in venture capital, another fraud).  The task now is finding out how to sell [crypto] as a tool, rather than a speculative investment.  The villains of the 2022 crypto collapse were, with one exception, born and bred in this darkness. They saw little more in crypto than the prospect of good hunting. Su Zhu and Kyle Davies started Three Arrows Capital to trade foreign currencies before transitioning to crypto. Sam Bankman-Fried infamously came to crypto from technical trading at Jane Street. Steve Ehrlich of Voyager Digital formerly helped run E-Trade. Alex Mashinsky was steeped in Silicon Valley tech VC and its accompanying blather. The one exception is Terra creator Do Kwon, who did build a crypto network – but did it on the shifting sands of venture capital, leverage and concealed risk.  The carpetbaggers saw crypto as the next hot thing, but they clearly never understood it. Above all, they didn’t understand that good cryptos are public networks and generate returns through vastly different mechanisms than corporations. This was most clear with lending platforms including Celsius Network, Voyager and Terra’s Anchor protocol, which offered high and fairly fixed rates of return on assets that didn’t generate revenue, leading inexorably to illiquidity and collapse.  A large element driving this mega-screwup was a decade of low interest rates set by the U.S. Federal Reserve to drive investment. With historically safe and predictable financial options like Treasury bonds returning next to nothing, capital was pushed to the far ends of the risk curve – much of it ending up in crypto. Then, against this macroeconomic backdrop, fiscal policy was loosened to keep the economy afloat at beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excess cash found its way into bitcoin and other cryptos, which in turn found its way into emerging sub-sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT). Thus “DeFi Summer” was primed.  Some of blockchain’s johnny-come-latelies saw the early bubble in DeFi tokens, driven by the introduction of “yield farming,” and thought that was an enduring part of “crypto” writ large. The numbers and the jargon must have been intoxicating to them at first blush. In reality, of course, DeFi Summer was a one-time event that minted millionaires among knowledgeable insiders who navigated a minefield of smaller frauds and hacks. Durable DeFi platforms were in the end uniquely bad for the leverage gamblers, since on-chain returns are restrained by actual demand for loans – a restraint enforced by public code.  This is why, while Terra and its Anchor protocol looked like DeFi, they were in fact a sham – the sky-high returns promised through deposits in Anchor were coming not from system use, but from venture capitalists and other very finite outside sources. Dragonfly’s Haseeb Qureshi goes as far as calling yield farming an expensive “customer acquisition strategy,” where rates were paid out by marketing budgets. This month provided a poetic bookend to contrast that with stable DeFi systems: While Terra blew up while offering yield as high as 20%, MakerDAO recently reactivated 1% yield as demand for its products grew. One of those systems still exists as a going concern, and the other does not.  The use of VC funding to replace a functional business model is straight out of the Silicon Valley Venture Bubble playbook. Championed above all by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, the game is to subsidize user adoption then apply those “growth” figures to predict future *unsubsidized* use, attracting further investment, which is spent to subsidize more adoption.  See also: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance. Note DeFi | Opinion  Essentially, capital becomes a cudgel to eliminate enemies – including those with better-run businesses or superior technology – and build monopolies. While Thiel framed his game plan as a way to starve out the competition, the approach could also be considered a form of finance-driven deception.  But reality is reasserting itself: Uber, founded 15 years ago, is still above all an elaborate mechanism for setting money on fire. Facebook (now Meta), the investment that made Thiel’s name, was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 this year. But early investors in Facebook or Uber certainly don’t care: They’ve already cashed in. This love ‘em and leave ‘em financial philandering becomes even more insidious when tokens are involved, because VCs can dump their bags on the public pretty much whenever they want.  What’s next  So from Silicon Valley to Wall Street, a long-term grift is being exposed. The continued rise in U.S. interest rates will peel away more strips of overcapitalized fat until, in many cases, there’s nothing left.  To be clear, I’m not calling for a purge of either venture capital or hedge fund-style speculation. There are good-faith funders in the space who are genuinely interested in building big new businesses over the course of years, not just grabbing the money and running. The crypto industry has for years relied on small-time traders to provide liquidity and rigor, and they will always have a seat at the table.  Unfortunately, the good funders and hard-nosed traders have been overshadowed by con artists we mistook for business people. Even more to the point, the 2020-2021 bull market distorted the natural order of things by making the finance bros the stars of the show instead of the supporting players they are meant to be. They built castles in the sky, funneling the life savings of naïve retail speculators into tokens from fundamentally flawed projects and collecting fat fees for the effort.  This exemplifies the tragic curse of the financier as a species: If you only understand numbers but not where they come from, you don’t understand anything at all.  And so, thoroughly spooked by crypto, institutions and hedge funds will take their ball and go home for much of 2023. Amateur day traders hoping to make life-changing money off the efforts of others will, hopefully, decide to do something more productive with their energies (and they’ll be better off for it). There will be less money to go around for developers: teams will have to go lean, and many projects (including more than a few good ones) will evaporate.  See also: Andrew Keys – 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023 | Opinion  But again, in the big picture, this is largely for the best. Crypto still has limited capacity to responsibly absorb capital: contra Peter Thiel, you can’t simply spend your way to adoption of something so novel and complex. Actual developers working on crypto projects are still in the low thousands.  But for the next two years at least, smaller funders, more firmly rooted in the ideals and technology of crypto, will be in pole position on good deals and ideas. They’ll do what financiers are actually meant to do – not farm hype and magazine covers for themselves, but help the actual builders do their jobs.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

Popsicle’s ICE token’s price jumped some 220% in the last 24 hours, according to cryptocurrency price tracker CoinGecko. The token currently is trading at 36 U.S. cents, only two days after hitting an all-time low of 9 cents.  Popsicle was part of a loose conglomerate of DeFi projects known as ""Frog Nation"" that were helmed by Sestagalli as recently as January, including Abracadabra.money, whose stablecoin was partly collateralized by the collapsed FTX exchange’s FTT token, and the since-failed Wonderland, a fork of OlympusDAO.  The sudden surge came after Sestagalli tweeted Wednesday that he was “focusing right now on rebuilding the OG Popsicle Finance,” breaking a four-month-long silence on Twitter.  Sestagalli, also known as Dani Sesta in crypto circles, garnered a cult following in crypto due to his community-based approach to building projects, CoinDesk wrote in January.  But his reputation took a hit earlier this year when influential crypto vigilante ZachXBT revealed that Sestagalli was working at Wonderland with an executive of the failed QuadrigaCX exchange, which allegedly defrauded investors of at least $190 million.

Popsicle Finance has had an atrocious 2022. Popsicle’s total value locked – a widely used DeFi metric to gauge activity and usage of any protocol – deflated to $1 million from $120 million in November 2021, according to DefiLlama.

42421090,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXWRtF,1671655407,See You on the Otherside: How Yuga Labs Is Bringing Its Billion-Dollar Business Into the Metaverse,"If you've been on Twitter over the last two years you've likely come across an influencer or celebrity sporting a Bored Ape Yacht Club profile picture (PFP). The colorful cartoon ape non-fungible tokens (NFT) have become something of a cultural phenomenon since launching in April 2021, functioning as a status symbol for collectors of the 10,000-piece digital art collection.  Though some may roll their eyes at the collection's lowbrow art style and fervent worship among the Twitter degens, the project combined several novel concepts – including publishing a road map, minting at a fixed price, introducing long-term utility and handing intellectual property (IP) rights to holders – that transformed the NFT market and became the blueprint for new projects. It has also spawned two successful offshoot projects (Bored Ape Kennel Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club) and has grown from an NFT collection to an entire ecosystem, complete with its own decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), cryptocurrency and a soon-to-be-launched gamified metaverse platform called Otherside.  To understand BAYC's success is to understand the leadership team behind it and the blockchain technology company, Yuga Labs, that powers all of its endeavors. Originally conceived by close friends Wylie Aronow and Greg Solano, who called in an A-team of college friends and childhood connections to bring the project to life, Yuga Labs has grown its staff to 110, expanded its portfolio of brands to include NFT projects CryptoPunks and Meebits and was valued at $4 billion earlier this year following a $450 million funding round.  On Dec. 19, the company announced that former Activision Blizzard President and Chief Operating Officer Daniel Alegre would be stepping in as its new CEO, bringing with him expertise in gaming that will help merge all of Yuga's passionate collector communities and shift its focus toward building an ""immersive Web3 world.""  ""That's the ultimate for us,” Aronow told me during an interview at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Miami, where the startup founders were celebrating CryptoPunk #305 being placed next to an Andy Warhol portrait on the wall of the museum. ""We see Otherside as the intersection of a lot of this stuff and where we see really the next evolution of the space going towards, where gaming is so important,"" Solano added.  Founder foundations  Aronow and Solano are the creative drivers of what they call a ""creative-first company.""  ""Our DNA is that we think of the things that we want to do and then figure out the creative stories that we want to tell,"" Solano told me. ""Then we figure out how we're going to do them and work back from there."" He and Aronow both have backgrounds in creative writing, showcased through BAYC's use of narrative-driven storytelling to create an entire universe around their characters. Aronow told me that despite their differences in personal taste and personality (""I'm extroverted, he's introverted,"") the duo has learned how to find common ground, playfully calling their relationship ""co-dependent.""  ""We have this extreme yin and yang thing going on,"" Aronow said. ""He pushes me, I rein him in and we find a spot where we’re aligned,"" Solano added.  In addition to literature, the two men are both avid gamers who initially bonded over a shared love of MMRPGs (massively multiplayer role-playing games) like World of Warcraft some 12 years ago. ""It was mostly just trading books and making jokes,"" Aronow said of their early relationship. In fact, Aronow and Solano spent much of their budding friendship communicating through online games and social platforms, instilling in them an appreciation for and a deep understanding of digital meeting spaces. ""[Before BAYC], we met in person maybe only four or five times,"" Solano said.  ""Our friendship was born in the metaverse, I guess you could say,"" Aronow joked.  Creating a project for the degens  Making the jump from crypto enthusiasts to founders of a multi-billion-dollar company was the combination of good planning and good timing.  A mutual interest in Ethereum grew as crypto began to spike in the late 2010s, inspiring the two friends to create a blockchain-based project together. They recruited Solano's college friends Kerem Atalay and Zeshan Ali, who helped to co-found Bored Ape Yacht Club, alongside Aronow's childhood best friend Nicole Muniz, who has served the company's CEO and will shift into a role as partner and strategic adviser when Daniel Alegre takes over as CEO next year.  ""The first time you hear about crypto is because someone probably casually mentioned it and you don't know what to make of it,"" Aronow said. ""And then the second time you hear about crypto is probably the most important time because the person who told you the first time has now made a lot of money off it.""  Aronow had been dealing with an autoimmune condition for several years, which led him to seek social interactions and community online. The pair soon became active on Crypto Twitter – aka the corners of Twitter where communities of crypto enthusiasts share market movements and memes – and were fascinated with what they saw as an emerging social movement around NFTs and Ethereum.  ""We became interested in the personalities and the culture that was being built on crypto Twitter and, in particular, around Ethereum. It just felt like there was suddenly a platform for people to build upon,"" he said.  The COVID-19 pandemic, the co-founders said, helped to accelerate the process by bringing people indoors and pushing them to find new ways to collaborate in digital spaces.  ""I think there's no coincidence that we launched during the lockdown, and a lot of people were somewhat lonely at their computers, hanging out,"" Solano said.  ""We think a lot about the impact that COVID had on the creation of Bored Ape Yacht Club and why NFTs and the 10K profile picture collections boom took off,"" Aronow continued. ""I feel strongly that, for better or worse, human beings seem to do better with communal families or tribes. There was just a longing to be a part of a club.""  He shared stories of pseudonymous Twitter personalities tweeting late at night that they were bored and were looking for companions to play video games with. Combined with the affectionate term embraced by the crypto community of ""aping"" into a project with zeal, Bored Ape Yacht Club was born.  ""All these folks who ‘aped' into crypto at some point, who probably became rich in the scope of things,"" Aronow said. ""They just wanted to be among other people with shared interests.""  Ultimately, they say, while the project was crafted as a ""loving homage"" to the ""degenerate traders"" of the crypto ecosystem, many of their early community members were first-time NFT buyers who were learning alongside them. ""There came this moment ... where we realized that we were building it for ourselves rather than for anyone else,"" said Aronow.  Scaling for growth  It wasn't long before fine art purveyors, celebrity collectors and crypto millionaires swarmed to collect what had become one of the most sought-after NFT projects to date.  According to OpenSea, BAYC has done 699,831 ETH (about $844 million at the time of publishing) in total trading volume since launching, which doesn't even count their offshoots the Bored Ape Kennel Club and Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs. This year, Yuga Labs also acquired several legacy NFT projects, including CryptoPunks, Meebits and 10KTF, propelling the company forward in ways the two co-founders say they weren't initially prepared for.  ""For a long time we were a small team, like in January of this year we were still 11 people,"" said Solano. ""We held on to being a very small, nimble team for maybe too long.""  Yuga Labs has released the IP rights of its collections to its holders, allowing NFT characters to be used on branding for food trucks, TV shows and music groups. This has created new revenue streams for holders and has fostered more brand loyalty. ""We always talk about how we build the scaffolding for everyone else to sort of build on the story,"" said Aronow. At this year's ApeFest, the brand's annual music and networking festival for BAYC holders, Solano shared that ""it felt like almost everyone we met was building in space or was leveraging their IP.""  Bringing their community to the Otherside  In recent months, the two co-founders have been looking for ways to merge the narratives of all of their NFT brands into one shared ecosystem. In April, Yuga Labs announced the Otherside, a gamified, interoperable metaverse experience, where players could own land and turn their existing NFTs into playable characters. Yuga Labs sold 55,000 Otherdeed NFTs linked to virtual land ownership, raking in about $320 million in primary sales.  ""All of the projects that we have are deeply important to us,"" said Aronow. ""Wherewe see the Otherside is at that intersection.""  In July, the brand ran an invite-only ""First Trip"" for over 4,600 players, giving the first glimpse at what their world-building platform would look like. In a litepaper released shortly after the event, developers said that in the initial stages, only Otherdeed holders and selected third-party developers would be able to participate in the ""narrative gameplay experience.""  ""In the future, we look forward to seeing what new experiences and games our community can create to expand the possibilities of the metaverse,"" the litepaper teased.  The next stages of the Otherside metaverse remain shrouded in secrecy, though they are being built on the foundations of gaming and narrative-driven storytelling that initially brought the founders together. Yuga Labs has teased another possible character collection called Kodas that are embedded into Otherdeed NFTs and released a promotional video in September promising more storytelling by the end of this year.  Beyond an expansion of their brand, Aronow views the metaverse as a concept representing ""nebulous determinism that might be a sort of like an endpoint for the Internet.""  ""If we're going to start truly inhabiting digital spaces around the clock, what does that look like? Is it going to feel egalitarian? Is it going to feel interoperable?""  ""The idea of clocking into work in the metaverse in a really unfun way sounds hellaciously dystopian,"" he added, calling the Otherside ""a platform for gaming and weird experiences.""  It's no coincidence that their incoming CEO helped oversee gaming titles including World of Warcraft while at Activision Blizzard – the same game that Aronow kept coming back to during our interview as a source of inspiration for the Otherside.  ""We started thinking about how to incentivize cooperation,"" Aronow told me of Yuga's early metaverse ambitions. ""In World of Warcraft, for instance, you could play the game as a mostly single player, but if you came across a big baddie in the swamp and you saw another player around ... suddenly you're incentivized to go up to that person and say 'Hey, can you help me kill this thing? We'll share the rewards.'""  Creating a ""truly co-developed, egalitarian metaverse that is fun"" is now Yuga's ""highest priority,"" said Solano. ""It's really about encouraging people to work together and get to know each other.""  ""It exemplifies ... why we wanted to do this in the first place,"" Aronow concluded.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Rosie Perper,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/12/21/see-you-on-the-otherside-how-yuga-labs-is-bringing-its-billion-dollar-business-into-the-metaverse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/850de1def1966a19768ecb8dec7eeeb17c8b3192-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ivanov's remarks come as WAVES dropped around 30% in the past month alone, trading at $1.50 as of shortly before 4:00 p.m. ET, amid concerns over the price volatility of Neutrino USD (USDN-USD), a WAVES-backed algorithmic stablecoin that's designed to be pegged one-to-one with the U.S. dollar. The coin, though, has increasingly de-pegged from the dollar over the past month, changing hands at just $0.51 at the time of writing, according to CoinMarketCap data . This isn't the first time an algorithmic stablecoin lost its parity with the greenback. Recall in May when TerraUSD ( UST-USD ), the third largest stablecoin by market cap at the time, dropped under $1 after crypto whales dumped large stakes.

42420854,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtVin,1671653644,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Bitcoin and Ether’s Flat Trajectory to Continue, Technical Indicators Suggest","Bitcoin and ether continue to trade flat, as volatility for the two assets wanes.  Bitcoin (BTC) prices stabilized following the FTX fallout, now off a mere 2% from Nov. 11. The ether price (ETH) is down a more pronounced 6% from the same date.  The most recent six months of trading activity for BTC has followed a familiar, if not exhausting pattern.  Trade flat for a period of time  Decline in price following turmoil within a centralized crypto entity  Trade flat for a period of time at that new lower level  Number 3 is where we are now.  Predicting the length of time that crypto assets will remain range-bound is challenging, if not foolhardy. There are some cues to pay attention to, however.  Momentum for both BTC and ETH remains in neutral territory, using the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) as a proxy for momentum. BTC’s current RSI is approximately 49.06 – a very middling level. RSI is a technical indicator that ranges from 1-100. Readings over 70 imply that an asset is potentially overbought, while readings under 30 imply that an asset is possibly oversold.  Searching BTC data back to 2015, and filtering for RSI levels between 49 and 50 shows 61 occurrences with an average gain of 2.2%, 30 days after the fact.  For ETH, filtering for RSI levels between 47 and 49, showed 43 occurrences since 2017, with an average 30-day gain of 6.7%.  Applying those performance figures to current prices, results in prices of $17,144 for bitcoin and $1,291 for ether. This is far from earth-shattering, given where both have traded in the past.  The results should not be viewed as predictive but can provide context as to where investors think prices may wind up.  Bitcoin Bollinger Bands  If using the historic data for guidance, it’s difficult to find a bullish scenario in the short term. Both price points fall within areas of significant price agreement, decreasing the likelihood of prices pushing higher without an external catalyst.  Current data doesn’t offer much either. Both BTC and ETH are both showing declines in volatility because the Average True Range of their price movements has fallen 47% and 46% since November.  Their respective Bollinger Bands lend additional credence, as BTC and ETH have stayed closely tethered to their 20-day moving averages, straying from the mean only briefly, before reverting back.  As a counterpoint, there isn’t much of a bearish case to be made either.  The appetite of asset managers has picked up, adding to their long positions in bitcoin for three consecutive weeks.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (CFTC) Commitment of Traders report is a weekly listing the open interest for futures and options.  The most recent release shows that asset managers now account for 40% of long open interest on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and are reportedly 83% long as a group.  Derivatives markets show a decline in the ratio of bitcoin put options to call options. One interpretation is that investors see declining opportunities to be profitable by betting against crypto.  Ultimately, it likely boils down to investor time horizon.  If long-term biased, the current market structure likely provides you with a solid entry point. Shorter-term traders however may be turned off by the lack of price movement.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/21/crypto-markets-analysis-bitcoin-and-ethers-flat-trajectory-to-continue-technical-indicators-suggest,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9204d15aa2e48b107b255642b78e5a69d3f356cb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has been moving sideways at the range between $16,700 and $16,900 in the past 24 hours.  “Bitcoin isn't getting much of a boost from the positive risk-on environment that is running through Wall Street,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at foreign exchange Oanda, wrote in a Wednesday note.  Ether (ETH) followed a similar trajectory, trading flat at $1,210. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) was down 0.16%.  U.S. equities were a bit more buoyant on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was recently trading up 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.4%, while the S&P 500 was up 1.4%.  Traders have been navigating the continuing nervousness on the potential market contagion from the FTX collapse over the past month and closely watching the U.S. Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on possibly continuing to raise interest rates in 2023.  “The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow previously said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008. When the Fed pivoted there was a relief rally for S&P 500, but as the interest rates finally started going down the market crashed another 40%.”  Kralow pointed out that the markets bottomed when the fed funds rate was basically at zero, adding: “This doesn’t bode well for bitcoin in 2023, and we could potentially see its price fall to $10,000 or even lower next year.”  To Alex Tapscott, managing director of the digital asset group at Ninepoint Partners, the current market environment is similar to December 2018 when bitcoin (BTC) hit a then-all-time high in the winter of 2017, and 2018 began “a long period of contraction” in terms of the value among crypto assets.  Tapscott told CoinDesk in an interview that the bitcoin drawdown from its all-time high in November 2021 is around 77%, compared to previous bear market lows of 84%, which could suggest further downside.  “But we are kind of in that sweet spot where it's starting to look a lot like previous eras,” he said.  “You could try and pick a bottom and set yourself up for what I think is going to be a really strong period of growth,"" he added. “But you might not get rewarded for being early because it might retest the same level a couple more times.”",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/21/bitcoin-trades-sideways-as-stocks-get-pre-holiday-bounce,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6f36595ea747310fb5690905fe7eeea68681b67b-1138x652.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42394082,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXFmP,1671651844,Self-Custody Is the Antidote to FTX’s Fraud,"Recent bankruptcy filings and Sam Bankman-Fried's criminal indictment make it clear that fraud precipitated FTX's collapse. For many policymakers, the loopholes enabling such criminal acts haven't yet become clear. These loopholes permitted flawed – or in FTX’s case, criminal – intermediaries to stand between consumers and their assets. If the U.S. Congress is serious about preventing future catastrophes like FTX, protecting consumers’ inherent right to self-custody clearly mitigates third-party vulnerabilities.  Warren Davidson is the U.S. representative for Ohio's 8th congressional district.  Just what and who needs legal protection? While Satoshi Nakamoto’s 2008 Bitcoin white paper effectively launched this era of fintech innovation, the legal and regulatory framework today continues to reinforce the structure of our traditional financial system and the legacy flaws that come with it. Fraud is one of these legacy flaws. Fraud committed under the guise of ""innovation"" is still fraud. FTX exemplified this.  In short, Bankman-Fried found a way to convince customers and investors to allocate dollars to FTX's platform (or, rather, FTX's balance sheet) by promising to be a third-party intermediary to purchase digital assets on their behalf. Customers then maintained ""balances"" in their FTX accounts while Bankman-Fried put funds under the control of Alameda Research, the trading firm he founded in 2017. He established his own cryptocurrency, FTT, to use as collateral for any loans made from FTX to Alameda. He then leveraged his assets under Alameda's control at unprecedented levels.  While this overview spares many details, this is the same criminal approach that has been seen before in traditional finance. FTX customers who transferred their digital assets off FTX's platform and onto their own self-hosted wallets – devices that allow digital assets to be stored off the internet – protected themselves from FTX's fraud. This approach provides the only sound protection against any third-party intermediary’s failure.  Read more: Marta Belcher - Elizabeth Warren's New Financial Surveillance Bill Is a Disaster for Privacy and Civil Liberties  FTX leveraged the hype around distributed ledger technology but, ironically, FTX promoted the exact opposite framework that Satoshi proposed. Reading the first two sentences of the Bitcoin white paper highlights this irony: ""Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust-based model."" FTX simply exploited the inherent flaws in the permissioned, third-party financial system Satoshi observed and sought to remedy.  Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently introduced a bill to build a concrete enclosure around these trust-based models while trapping consumers inside with no way out. Specifically, her bill requires the Treasury Secretary to promulgate a rule prohibiting financial institutions from transacting with self-hosted wallets. She mischaracterizes the FTX situation and claims she's been ""ringing the alarm bell in the Senate on the dangers of these digital asset loopholes.""  Let's be clear – her open hostility towards financial freedom is a clear and present danger to consumers and will only reinforce the system fraudsters continue to exploit.  That's why I introduced the Keep Your Coins Act last February. It was only a matter of time before someone in Washington, D.C., would try to compel the Treasury Department to interfere with consumers' inherent right to self-custody of their digital assets – to own and possess private property. In the wake of FTX's collapse, it should be evident that protecting self-custody is must-pass legislation.  In his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee, John J. Ray III, the current FTX CEO overseeing the bankruptcy process, discussed how all of FTX customers' digital assets were commingled. This model left customers with only a ""claim"" over their assets rather than actual possession.  We have a technology that allows consumers to avoid third-party vulnerabilities. It's imperative to embrace this opportunity to protect consumers. FTX was not about crypto; it was about a criminal exploiting a traditional third-party relationship by failing to do what he said he was doing – establishing a property right to digital assets on behalf of customers who deposited funds with his company. Self-custody has proved the only foil to his scheme, and Congress should protect it rather than undermine it with Senator Warren’s disingenuous assault on financial freedom.",POSITIVE,FTT,BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | FTT,Warren Davidson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/21/self-custody-is-the-antidote-to-ftxs-fraud,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/11ed901834e6925067818cc6c796967cc040f774-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Will See Better Days In 2023 Per a recent report from Coinbase, Bitcoin has been resilient in the current market turmoil. Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) hiking interest rates, a high inflation environment, and the collapse of major companies in the crypto ecosystem, BTC: (…) remains one of the primary reserve currencies of the crypto economy. This became evident several times during the year when overleveraged players throughout the market – CeFi lenders, hedge funds, and venture capital (VC) funds – became forced sellers. Bitcoin’s capacity to withstand the collapse of these companies and entities, including some of the largest BTC miners, indicates its “long-term success.” Regardless of these events, Coinbase claims that BTC continued to see adoption and traction in 2022. Bitcoin outperformed some of the world’s major currencies in the macroeconomic landscape. As seen in the chart below, the BTC price saw a better performance than the Euro (EUR) and the Japanese Yen (JPY) in 2022. This performance strengthens BTC’s long-term bullish thesis and its vital role as a global asset, according to the report: (…) the value proposition for bitcoin has only strengthened this year as sovereign currencies around the world have shown signs of stress and central banks continue to grapple with policy credibility. BTC Hits Critical Milestone Comparing BTC’s current price performance and fundamentals, Coinbase determined that many Bitcoin holders are at a loss.

Sorkin told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” that if he had been part of SBF’s legal team he would’ve told the 30-year-old to refrain from speaking so candidly during his many media appearances. Better yet, say nothing at all.  “If I spoke to him, I would say ‘shut up,’' Sorkin said, adding that the only individuals and entities concerned with what SBF had to say were regulators and prosecutors. “He should’ve kept quiet,” he later added.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried to be Extradited to the U.S.  Sorkin is now a partner at law firm Mintz & Gold. When he represented Bernie Madoff, the financier went to jail for leading one of the largest and longest-running Ponzi schemes in history. He died in prison.  Sorkin still questions why Bankman-Fried went on a media tour in the first place.  “No lawyer worth their salt is going to tell him to go out and hold press conferences and speak to groups,” Sorkin said. No attorney would have ever told Bankman-Fried to “go out and tell the world you made a mistake and you are negligent … you keep your mouth shut.”  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried's Self-Incrimination Tour / Opinion  Bankman-Fried is in the process of being extradited from the Bahamas, where he was arrested, to the U.S., where he faces criminal and civil charges. Sorkin said the extradition was “inevitable” and is likely Bankman-Fried’s way of avoiding spending “weeks and months” in an unpleasant Fox Hill prison. By waiving his extradition rights, Sorkin said Bankman-Fried is looking to speed up the legal process.  What happens next? There are a number of scenarios. According to Sorkin, Bankman-Fried’s bail conditions will depend on whether he is deemed a “threat to the community” or a flight risk. Bankman-Fried could also face home confinement, with a high chance of being monitored and even wearing an ankle bracelet, Sorkin said.

Schiff has always been vocal about his disdain for bitcoin and has now turned his attention to MicroStrategy and its former CEO, Michael Saylor. Why MicroStrategy Bought Bitcoin In a tweet, Peter Schiff revealed to his more than 890,000 Twitter followers what he says was the real reason behind Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy’s move to begin investing in bitcoin. According to Schiff, former CEO Michael Saylor had admitted that buying BTC was actually a last-ditch effort to save the company from being liquidated. He further dissed the company saying that it has nothing going for it other than a leveraged speculative position on the digital asset. For the first time I heard @saylor admit that adding #Bitcoin to the @MicroStrategy balance sheet was basically a Hail Mary to avoid liquidating the company. If the only thing $MSTR has going for it is a leveraged speculative position in Bitcoin, than it has nothing going for it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2022 As expected, Schiff’s strikes toward bitcoin were met with pushback from supporters. One user took to the comment section to defend MicroStrategy’s decision as one that was taken so it could acquire the “scarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen.” However, Schiff would denounce this saying that bitcoin was in no way scarce nor was it desirable. He also added that bitcoin was a way to lose money. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Falls Below Critical Point, Why There Is More Pain To Come Schiff continues to advocate for gold as a better option for investors. Bitcoin maximalist Dan Held hit back at the economist saying, “[Gold] is hardly scare and in no way desirable. If you want to lose your money there are plenty of ways to do it. You don’t need to buy [Gold].” BTC touches above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com So Why Did Saylor Buy BTC? Michael Saylor is arguably one of the most vocal bitcoin bulls. The ex-CEO of MicroStrategy has previously stated that his decision to purchase bitcoin was that he believed that the digital asset is the future of finance. Additionally, Saylor previously revealed that he had personally owned BTC before MicroStrategy had begun purchasing the cryptocurrency, his own personal holdings serving as evidence for the profitability of the asset. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Welcomes 10,000 New Holders, Can SHIB Keep Up The Momentum? As the company expects the price of bitcoin to appreciate over time, it believes that it will serve as an effective inflation hedge over the long term. Saylor himself has referred to BTC as “digital gold, saying “We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value.” MicroStrategy’s decision to invest in bitcoin also helped boost the popularity of the company, going from a company operating in the background to one of the most popular names among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. MicroStrategy is currently the public company with the largest BTC holdings in the world. The company held 130,000 BTC as of Sep. 30, 2022, worth over $2.1 billion at current market prices. At a cumulative entry value of almost $4 billion, the company is recording more than $1.7 billion in unrealized losses following the market downturn.

Led by Vessenes, the company said in a press release its first-of-its-kind publicly accessible ecosystem fund ""is designed to provide broad economic access to global accredited investors looking to support the next era of the internet.""  ""Lamina1 is in a unique position given the incredible volume of inquiries we receive from those building the open metaverse every day,” said Vessenes. ""The team has a front-row seat to all happening in the ecosystem and essentially gets a ‘first look’ at what many of the most compelling creators and storytellers of our time are doing, building, making, and producing around the world.""  L1EF has launched on AngelList, a venture platform that allows startups to raise money from angel investors. Notably, the platform offers rolling funds, which allow interested investors to fund projects through quarterly subscriptions. L1EF is offering a subscription starting at $2,500 quarterly over a minimum period of four quarters.  ""Layer 1 teams build infrastructure and in turn experience creators utilize that infrastructure,"" the Lamina1 team explained on its fundraising page. ""Ecosystem funds bridge the gap between the two, providing capital, talent, and advisory to those who wish to use the chain. In exchange, these funds have the privilege of being able to make broad-scale investments in the earliest stage of a blockchain’s lifecycle.""  In an investor letter, Vessenes said that he hoped L1EF would serve the goals of Lamina1 in creating an ""open metaverse built and to deliver economic access to the platform as broadly as possible.""

Along with Vessenes, the project has onboarded former Magic Leap executive Rebecca Barkin as its president, music industry and arts executive Jessica Toon to lead its music investments and Aspen Institute Fellow Christine Keung.  While Lamina1 is still in its early stages, the project will soon launch a testnet showcasing future use cases.  ""[Vessenes] has a deep understanding and demonstrated success of growing economies around a chain,"" said Barkin.

Peter McCormack: Judge Rules McCormack Should Pay Around $1.1M in Costs,"Bitcoiner and podcaster Peter McCormack should pay Craig Wright, the Australian scientist who claims to be Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto, around 900,000 British pounds (US$1.1 million) in costs following their legal battle, U.K. High Court Judge Martin Chamberlain has ruled.  Wright had argued that McCormack should pay the majority of costs for the legal proceedings, but accepted paying all McCormack's costs save for those ruled in Wright's favor.  The costs ruled in Wright's favor relate to an earlier judgment from October last year, finding that McCormack could not prove that he was telling the truth when he labeled the Wright a fraud.  The two men's legal battle emanated from a 2019 discussion – subsequently broadcast on YouTube – in which McCormack called Wright a liar and a fraud and said he ""is not Satoshi."" Wright claimed that such comments caused him financial damage after he was disinvited to speak at various events and conferences.  The judge concluded in August that Wright had advanced false evidence in his claim, and therefore awarded him only nominal damages of one pound ($1.23). In his final judgment, Chamberlain refused Wright's permission to appeal this decision.  The judge also did not grant Wright's request for an injunction to be made against McCormack repeating these claims.  Craig Wright has been involved in a string of legal battles surrounding his claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto, of whom nobody knows the true identity. Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper in 2008 and released the first version of its software the following year, before fading from the community in subsequent years.

42413380,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8XNq,1671639056,Another Crypto.com Ad Banned by UK Advertising Regulator,"Crypto exchange Crypto.com had a Facebook ad banned by the U.K.'s Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), falling foul of the industry's self-regulatory organization for the second time this year.  The ad for Crypto.com NFT was seen on the social media platform in July. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique tokens on the blockchain tied to real-world assets. The ASA took issue with the ad because it did not illustrate the risk of investing in NFTs and didn’t make clear that fees would apply, it said Wednesday.  In January, the ASA banned two of the company's ads, saying they were considered to be misleading and irresponsible, taking advantage of consumers’ “inexperience or credulity” and failed to make clear that crypto investments aren’t regulated in the U.K. Crypto.com received Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) approval to operate in the country in August.  ""Because the [Facebook] ad did not include any risk warning making consumers aware that the value of NFTs could go down as well as up, or that they were an unregulated crypto asset we concluded that the ad was misleading,"" it said. ""We told Foris DAX Global Ltd t/a Crypto.com that their advertising must make clear the risks of NFTs ... . They should also not omit material information regarding fees and charges on their platform.""  In a submission to the authority, the exchange pointed out that the ad was no longer live and that it promoted the trading platform, not a specific NFT. Therefore, it said, ""it would be unreasonable to request that the specific ad include limitations or qualifications regarding the risk of investing in NFTs,"" according to the ASA's statement. Further, the ad referred to only to buying NFTs, which are fee free, and so ""the need to mention fees in the ad was not relevant and any qualification would only confuse consumers.""

42407228,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJrpP,1671638784,DeFi’s Difficult Governance Decisions Lie Ahead,"Financial institutions are starting to realize they should have been embracing decentralized finance (DeFi) all along. By the end of 2023 the largest DeFi ecosystems will be the most demonstrably decentralized ones.  Although decentralization is the bedrock on which all blockchain technologies are built, it is hardly a guarantee across crypto. The recent boom-bust market cycle was marked by the rise of two competing approaches among crypto finance ventures: censorship-resistance versus speed.  Kevin Mehrabi is the CEO of Wealthchain. This article is part of Crypto 2023.  In recent years, the few financial institutions brave enough to enter crypto have generally preferred centralized entities to invest in. These are firms that offered the veneer of transparency and were run by people with reputations to lose.  In 2023, after the disastrous reckoning across the crypto industry, we will finally see their massive shift of institutional interest towards genuinely trustless protocols.  The decentralization-first crowd begins their platforms on a smart-contract level – deploying permissionless applications onto a blockchain. Although protocols like Compound, Aave and Uniswap have development entities, they are protocols first and foremost. They eschew custodial wallets and off-chain collateral, ensuring that the flow of funds is observable on a public block record.  See also: Adoption of DeFi, ZK Tech, NFTs and More Will Continue to Increase in 2023  Decentralization advocates view centralized ventures as everything wrong with traditional finance. Of course, layering centralization across blockchains would lead to the same problems that inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to build Bitcoin. DeFi in its truest sense is the completion of this decentralization-first purist approach.  Centralization-first industrialists have historically paid lip service to crypto’s main tenets of openness, verifiability and irreversibility all while saying central intermediaries would have to come into play at some point. They dismissed the decentralization-first approach as unsustainable idealism from tone-deaf techie folk. And, truth enough, FTX, Celsius Network, Nexo, BlockFi and Voyager Digital did scale rapidly. But greater speed and more feature capability comes with risks.  The events of 2022 demonstrated that centralization-first approaches to crypto finance present the greater risk. Indeed, the unmonitored control of off-chain capital by FTX and Celsius enabled the misdeeds and bad trades that led to their catastrophic collapse. Meanwhile, the transparency and security of the decentralization-first set including Aave, Compound, Sushi and dYdX have left those DeFi platforms virtually unscathed. In fact, Uniswap recently surpassed Coinbase in trading volume for the first time to become the world’s second-largest exchange.  Critics will point to historical DeFi hacks as evidence that DeFi is not as secure as decentralization-first purists would describe. However, those exploits are not indicative of the whole. Rather, many exploits this year were due to the rush of untested platforms released into the wild, and security auditors being overwhelmed by demand that outpaced their ability to maintain quality. When built, reviewed and governed properly, DeFi platforms can be as secure as the blockchains on which they were deployed.  Governance maximalism  Likewise, the degree of decentralization among the underlying blockchains themselves will become a subject of increasing importance to DeFi in 2023. Poorly decentralized blockchain governance can and has led to contentious hard forks in which the blockchain community, network and most importantly every digital asset issued on that chain suffer a “split.”  Without decentralized governance, dissent can only lead to division. The outcomes of these events are unpredictable: Each respective faction claims to be the authentic continuance of the previously united chain. One faction could rally the network and become dominant – but that dominance can change over time. The uncertainty itself is the problem.  Asset-split risk is an underdiscussed problem for DeFi – with potentially calamitous repercussions. Ethereum saw a contentious chain split after its recent hard fork (the Merge), for which JPMorgan expressed concerns a rival proof-of-work-run Ethereum could cause market confusion and split the network. That didn’t happen this time, but that’s because nearly everyone building on Ethereum supported an upgrade to proof-of-stake – not every decision will be as black and white going forward.  See also: Where Is the Ethereum Virtual Machine Headed in 2023? (Hint: Beyond Ethereum)  Imagine if Tether’s USDT reserves suddenly had to collateralize assets for not just one set of tokens on Ethereum but two after a contentious chain split. For financial institutions evaluating the prospect of tokenizing trillions of dollars in capital and quadrillions of dollars in derivatives, even a low prospect for asset-splitting becomes untenable.  So, how will financial institutions embrace DeFi while minimizing asset-split risk? The simple solution is through diversification to many different DeFi ecosystems. “The future is multi-chain,” after all. An additional safeguard is to engage with DeFi ecosystems on blockchains that are the least likely to suffer asset splits – that is, blockchains with the most decentralized forms of governance.  How can blockchain protocol governance be decentralized? Blockchains such as Algorand enable validators to vote on upgrade proposals. Tezos, a network I have a stake in seeing succeed, put as many governance decisions on-chain. Thus far, Tezos has had 12 successful upgrades since its 2018 launch, with all contentions resolved on-chain.  As financial institutions increasingly engage DeFi over the course of 2023, the scope of standards for decentralization will extend to governance at all levels. It would behoove DeFi platforms and the blockchain communities on which they are built to take heed.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | FORKS,Kevin Mehrabi,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/21/defis-difficult-governance-decisions-lie-ahead,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8f765451e4efa0f93337613784348b445fd8d12f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42407221,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJrm6,1671638522,How Crypto Exchanges Can Be Free of Risk,"We have recently been reminded that markets, as heavily as we rely on them, are far from ideal in practice. For one thing, settlement risk of major equities markets is increasingly capable of taking down the global economy. This is because of the growing number of traders occasionally using social media to in effect collude, such as with GameStop.  For another, cryptocurrency marketplaces such as FTX have caused huge losses to users because of the lack of full custody coverage. These issues stem from the way current electronic markets were simply designed as copies of open outcry and paper-based markets – and, also, ironically, from the fact that all the major crypto markets were built in an unprecedentedly centralized manner.  Even a commitment to full coverage is, of course, not enough to address custody risk – those running an exchange can easily abscond with its assets. And even if both settlement and custody risk are solved, information asymmetry remains a problem. Access to tremendously valuable information about trades and traders is available exclusively to those who operate all types of markets today. Somewhat akin to consumer data in Web2 versus Web3, this data has huge potential for a variety of clandestine market manipulations. There is currently no way to prove the negative, that such information is not being exploited to the detriment of traders and markets overall.  David Chaum, a pioneer in cryptography and in privacy preserving and secure voting technologies, is the creator and founder of the xx network. In 1995 his company, DigiCash, created and deployed eCash, the first digital currency, which used Chaum's breakthrough blind-signature protocol. This essay is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  A market mechanism I’ll introduce below solves these problems. It has no custody risk or settlement risk, and trader information is available only to the respective traders themselves.  The underlying type of market here is generally referred to as a “call market.” Such periodic auction markets are, for instance, used today in Nasdaq’s opening and closing periods. Traders place what should be sealed transaction requests during these trading periods. Only after the period ends are the requests, in effect, unsealed, a single price calculated from the requests and the trades that should clear at that price consummated.  To keep trader information from the exchange operator in the solution here, the market clearing price is calculated by a so-called multiparty computation (MPC). This term was coined by me to describe what are now increasingly often-deployed cryptographic techniques. These allow multiple encrypted inputs to be converted to a cleartext output by an agreed algorithm. The “computation” is in effect performed by the cryptographic protocol itself such that no party can decrypt the encrypted inputs posted, but all parties can be certain that the cleartext output was computed correctly from exactly those inputs.  Although most equities and traditional commodities today are not primarily represented on blockchains, a few are, such as by the Swiss exchange Sixth. In this system, however, to address settlement and custody risk all assets traded are held on blockchains. For instance, when the pair being traded is bitcoin against dollars, bitcoin is, of course, already on a blockchain and dollars would be on a dollar stablecoin blockchain. As part of the process of submitting a bid or ask, the asset is transferred to a wallet on the native blockchain of that asset. But such wallets are created to be under joint custody of the exchange and the trader – so-called “multisig” wallets. Their value can only be transferred out by cooperation of those two entities.  Read more: 10 Predictions for the Future of Crypto in 2023  Once the multiparty computation reveals the market clearing price as mentioned above, some of the multisig wallets will trade and the rest will be refunded. Bids above the clearing price, as well as asks below the clearing price, trade at the clearing price in a typical call market; non-traded bids and asks result in the assets in the associated multisig wallet being refunded to the trader who placed them there. Such refunds are easy to achieve: The exchange operator simply reveals its keys for all multisigs for which a zero-knowledge proof, provided by a given trader, shows that the particular price that was cryptographically committed to by that trader does not make the cutoff. (To ensure that the numbers of buyers and sellers that will trade are equal, different cutoffs can be provided for buy- and sell-side.) The keys issued by the exchange are useless to anyone except the trader in question, who then uses them to regain control of the asset they committed.  A simple way to accomplish the swap of those assets remaining locked in the multisig wallets is based on fixed lots on one side of the asset pair: for instance, one bitcoin against a variable number of dollars. (Larger trades could be made more efficient by multiple parallel markets, each for fixed lots such as two, four, eight and 16 bitcoin, but using the same clearing price; however, I’ll ignore this elaboration in what follows.) An amount of value initially moved to the multisig wallets on the variable-amount side by traders functions as a minimum “commitment fee.” Once the clearing price is established by MPC, traders on the variable-amount side transfer additional value to their respective multisig wallets so as to fund the exact amount required by the swap.  Finally, the MPC randomly pairs off all remaining counterparties, each pair comprising one trader on the bid side and one on the ask side. This then allows each pair to bilaterally complete an “atomic swap” protocol, in which settlement occurs directly as part of the trade. Such a swap is the only way the parties can unlock the value they placed in the multisig wallet. As I noted earlier, it results in the party on one side of the trade taking custody of what was the multisig wallet of their counterparty on the other side of the trade. What I’ve called “Liquifinity” is an atomic-swap technology that cryptographically secures against either party walking away before they give their counterparty the keys for the multisig to be transferred and thereby complete the swap. So parties that placed a bid for a price above the clearing price consummate a trade with randomly-selected counterparties that committed to an ask below the clearing price. No third party ever has custody, meaning no custody risk. And the trade is “atomic” – settlement coincident with the trade – meaning no settlement risk.  See also: Crypto 2023: It's Sanctions Season | Opinion  If, however, those operating the exchange could learn who is associated with specific bids or asks, this information could allow them to manipulate the market, such as by learning the approximate positions and trading patterns of participants. To solve this, what I’ve called “mixing” is used for all communication between traders and the exchange. Mixing conceals who is sending or receiving which message. Moreover, trader identities should not be associated with wallet IDs of the underlying assets being traded. Unlinking, in this way, any persistent user identity from trades hides who is behind transactions, which can be a useful source of information to anyone aiming to manipulate a market.  Collusion between an exchange and traders, or even potential extortion of traders by an exchange, however unthinkable in many settings, can be ensured against by a bond posted by the exchange. The bond need only be sufficient for the exposure of a single round of a call market, because such abuse would come to light before a next round. This makes the maximum backing of such exchanges extremely practical. It is in sharp contrast to what would be impractical bonding requirements for typical settlement or even for exchange arrangements with extended periods over which risks can accumulate.  This is a fully generalizable way to realize a market for pairs of assets. It includes a solution to both custody and settlement risk. And it obviates manipulation through information asymmetry by ensuring that all details remain private to traders. It is immediately applicable to crypto markets, where the need is most urgent and acutely felt. Once deployed, it will demonstrate that traditional markets can benefit significantly from adopting such best practices from crypto.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,David Chaum,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/12/21/how-crypto-exchanges-can-be-free-of-risk,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d9222221ff944ca7c0766e67947dd4d9b5bd6a2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407237,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gUJsd0,1671637889,The Next Generation of Automated Settlement,"“Quantity has a quality all its own.”—Thomas A. Callaghan Jr.  Although the ethical and legal dimensions of the FTX meltdown will be subject to ongoing debate, this much is clear in the wake of the biggest value destruction event in the history of our industry. CeFi, or centralized finance, is fatally flawed and no longer has a defensible value proposition to stand on. Exchanges have already seen the retail sector slip out of reach due to simple unit economics. Amid the bull rush, Super Bowl commercials and namesake stadiums pushed CAC/LTV ratios [lifetime value divided by the customer acquisition cost] beyond the realm of reality. And then when the market tanked in May, the not-all-that-large-to-begin-with pool of retail interest dried up abruptly, to the point that taking it on the chin became the default expectation for the family Thanksgiving dinner.  And now, after Sam Bankman-Fried and Caroline Ellison, there will be no good reason for large, well-run banks to use CeFi exchanges either. Whether the former heads of FTX and Alameda Research were guilty of criminal greed or just incredulous levels of stupidity is irrelevant. CeFi will head off into the sunset, as it deservedly should. “Disintermediation as a service” is prone to corruption and waste. It’s a bad premise on which to build a business, let alone a category.  Mike Maizels is the former head of research at Abra. This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's Crypto 2023 series.  As such, the next logical step for the industry is to turn its attention to where cryptocurrency potentials collide with the needs and frictions of legacy financial institutions. Decentralized finance (DeFi) may represent the financial “pipes” of the future, but it is the old world of traditional finance (TradFi) that still holds all the water. To date, adoption has been hindered by regulatory uncertainty, market volatility and the risks inherent in diving in to provable digital scarcity as an early entrant. But lying behind these immediate roadblocks, the way forward becomes somehow even less clear. Perhaps the most fundamental issue of all is sheer size. Consider the just market for foreign currency. JPMorgan settles forex trades with the combined value of the entire cryptocurrency sector every day.  Blockchain technology has much value to bring to this market, particularly through the novel capabilities of stablecoins. Their potential for instant settlement and close-to-zero marginal costs – which could unlock dramatically lower foreign exchange (FX) rates – is tantalizingly real, but the infrastructure needed to support adoption at scale is critically missing.  Scale matters because almost all present-day crypto settlement products were built under retail-sized premises. Namely, low marginal cost settlement has been made possible by the remarkable maturation of “automated market makers,” also known as AMMs. AMMs perform the work of legacy trading firms and banks, offering liquidity in the form of standings offers to buy and sell assets at specified prices – all without human intervention.  The ability to do so without human input lies in an elegant use of simple mathematical principles to maintain balance in liquidity pools. Two assets, X and Y, are held in a pool, with the product of their cumulative values linked to some constant. For the purposes of a simple explanation, assume the assets are equivalent to each other in price. 100 X units and 100 Y units makes a pool constant of 10,000. Now imagine a trader wants to acquire 10 units of Y. That would leave 90 in the pool, a deficit of 11.1 X units (10,000/90 = 111.1). This becomes the price (plus a small fee) paid by the trader for her new 10 units of Y. Note that 10 units of Y for 11.1 units of X represents an 11.1% premium over the abstract, 1:1 price parity under which the pool was established.  Read more: Preventing Crypto Exploits & Hacks in 2023 | Opinion  Importantly, this slippage grows exponentially as the trade size approaches the limits of the pool depth. Imagine if the trader wanted to acquire 99 units of Y. The price paid would be 9,900 units of X, a premium of just under 1 million percent. In practice, these unit economics limit the institutional utility of even the largest DeFi pools – Uniswap currently supports a daily trading volume less than a tenth of a percent of JPMorgan’s foreign exchange business.  Owing to such limitations, large institutions wishing to transact at scale have had no real choice other than to use custodial CeFi exchanges like FTX. Custodial here is key to the potential for abuse. Unlike traditional FX desks, which operate as deal-brokers but would rarely take custody of liquid assets, cryptocurrency exchanges take possession of the tokens in order to execute orders directly. This model, akin to permitting a real estate agent to move into your house and take possession of your deed as a precondition of sale, prepares the ground for disaster. Not only can exchanges front-run trades, profiting at the expense of clients, but the lack of deep liquidity makes it necessary to advertise large limit orders in a public manner. These limit orders may be anonymized to an extent, but even public awareness of the existence of large orders skews market intelligence to the detriment of all who seek to participate.  Builders are hard at work creating solutions for this blockage across a spectrum of time horizons. In the most immediate term, regulated cryptocurrency service providers are beginning to stand up over-the-counter (OTC) desks along the models of currency exchanges of yesteryear – working the phones on behalf of clients rather than taking custody of their assets in order to execute trades on their behalf. This will no doubt drive value; it is a matter of seconds to move stablecoins on a blockchain rather than days to settle fiat exchange through SWIFT.  See also: The Best Bitcoin Lightning Payment Solutions | Opinion  However, the use of human brokers foregoes the signature advantage of DeFi: trustless, automated functioning. Uber would be a remarkably less-efficient company if human switchboard operators were required to match riders to drivers. Tech-driven systems such as on-chain order books suffer from the converse problem. Their trustless nature necessitates a publicly visible set of trading positions, a flaw akin to poker players betting with cards displayed to all of their opponents.  However, a bottom-up approach to new tools to connect AMMs and to expand the kinds of instruments that they support (e.g., options with an expiration date) has the potential to push back the horizons of the possible. These topics have received important theoretical treatment by Dr. Maurice Herlihy, An Wang professor of computer science at Brown University, who has demonstrated that AMMs may be considered like electrical circuits. Properly constructed, they can operate either in series (trade asset A for B on one AMM, and B for C on another) or in parallel (split a large trade between A for B between multiple AMMs), arrangements that may be considered as mathematically equivalent to one larger AMM. Significantly, these different configurations can redistribute the costs of participating between traders (slippages, as described above) and capital providers (the much rehearsed impermanent loss). Such costs can never be fully eliminated, but they can be subjected both to rational minimization and strategic hedging (e.g., a synthetic “impermanent gain” token that offers insurance for impermanent loss).  The analogy with the electrical circuit is extremely important. The modern discovery of electromagnetic phenomena occurred in the late 18th century, and it took decades for the rules governing their operation to be formulated mathematically. It took several additional decades for the discipline of “electrical engineering” to emerge, which sought to harness the principles of electricity to perform socially useful functions. The first product, the telegraph, enabled only the exchange of direct messages, akin to the first permissionless, peer-to-peer payments on the Bitcoin ledger. The modern electrical infrastructure required numerous other independent inventions to come online together – the dynamo for generation, the battery for storage, the resistor and capacitor for modulation. But soon, these and other devices permitted not just inventors, but entrepreneurs to create technological marvels that transformed the fabric of the world.  Read more: 2023 Will Be the Year of Dapps – Here's What to Expect | Opinion  The cryptocurrency sector is fond of the analogy of “speed running the history of finance,” but we are also reprising the development of many other infrastructure-level technologies. From an electrical perspective, we are perhaps now in the 1860s. We have elaborated the circuitry of DeFi, and must now realize its potential to replace the oil lamps, hand cranks and steam engines of the present financial landscapes. Wiring AMMs together will require huge complementary efforts: rethinking security procedures and value capture through transaction ordering, a topic animating the widespread interest in grappling with maximum extractable value (MEV).  The history of electricity has one other valuable lesson to teach us. While the mythos emphasizes independent inventors with their lightbulb moments, the reality was that the path from idea to impact was blazed by new modes of collaboration between institutions of higher learning and the world outside their walls. Prior to the 19th century, colleges and universities saw themselves as space apart – zones of aristocratic privilege or monastic scholarship in which inquiry was prized for its own right and disparaged if it became tinged with social or commercial usefulness. That began to change in Germany and the U.S., with emergent departments of electrical engineering often leading the charge to carry out research designed for commercial or civil application. In all likelihood, the present crisis in graduate education, with soaring tuition costs and vanishing opportunities for “pure” academic positions, represents another epoch-defining shift. It will be to the great benefit of the cryptocurrency sector to find ways to capitalize.

6094118,https://newsbtc.com/?p=513238,1671636602,Chainlink Turns Bearish As Price Dips To 8-Month Low,"The Chainlink price has dropped to an eight-month low as the coin fell from the $6.30 price level. Since the Chainlink price has touched a multi-monthly low, the chances of the price turning around remain extremely likely. As Bitcoin slipped on its chart too, most altcoins have been depreciating on their respective charts as well. The technical outlook of the coin was bearish as accumulation decreased due to an increase in liquidation. Broader market support is necessary for LINK to propel its price to a higher level. For instance, Bitcoin has been stuck between the $17,400 and the $18,000 price levels. If BTC trades above the $17,400 level, multiple altcoins can potentially rally. Although the overall trend of the Chainlink price does not clearly indicate a breakout on the upside, the coin currently trades near a level that has previously triggered several rallies for the coin. Chainlink’s trading volume has decreased, indicating that bears have taken control of the market. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Take Beating As Investors Flip Alts For Bitcoin Chainlink Price Analysis: One-Day Chart LINK was trading at $5.99 at the time of writing. Ever since Chainlink fell from the $6.30 price level, the altcoin has broken below multiple support lines. Presently, the altcoin has secured the $5.70 support line as its local price floor. If demand for the altcoin registers a considerable increase, then the first barrier for LINK stood at $6.30, which marks a 40% rally in the price of the asset alone. Moving above the $6.30 mark can push LINK into the $7 zone. On the other hand, losing the $5.70 support line will drag Chainlink to $5.40. The amount of LINK traded in the last session declined, indicating sellers were dominant in the market. Technical Analysis The altcoin has registered a significant fall in demand ever since the beginning of this month. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also noted a multi-month low at the time of writing. The RSI was below the 40-mark and it registered a downtick; this could mean a further fall in price before LINK makes a comeback. Related Reading: Breaking: One Of The Largest P2P Crypto Exchanges Removes Ethereum Due To ‘Integrity’ The Chainlink price also travelled below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA), representing that the sellers were driving the price momentum in the market. SMA, however, registered a golden cross, which is when the 20-SMA crossed over the 50-SMA line; this marks a bullish signal for the coin. LINK also captured a sell signal on the daily chart. This was an indication to owners to sell the asset and buy later, as the altcoin’s price could fall further. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displayed red signal bars that are tied to the sell signal for the asset. The Bollinger Bands portray price volatility and fluctuation. The bands drew closer together, indicating that the price might fall further. Over the last 24 hours, LINK has dipped by 2%. In the past week, the coin has lost close to 14% of its market value.

XRP Whales And Sharks With 1M-10M Tokens Now Hold All-Time High Supply As per data from the analytics firm Santiment, 7.23% of the total XRP supply is now held by this key investor group. The relevant indicator here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us how the total supply is distributed across the different wallet groups in the market right now. These “wallet groups” are bands that define ranges between which the number of coins held by wallets belonging to a particular group lies in. For example, the “100-1,000 coins” group includes all addresses that are holding at least 100 and at most 1,000 XRP tokens. Related Reading: Altcoin Indexes Take Beating As Investors Flip Alts For Bitcoin The Supply Distribution metric has two versions; one shows the number of wallets (or more simply, the number of holders) belonging to each cohort, while the other measures the supply percentages contributed by each group. Now, here is a chart that shows data for both these Supply Distribution metrics for the 1M-10M coins band: Looks like the values of both these metrics have climbed up in recent days | Source: Santiment The 1M-10M coins band is an important cohort for XRP as it includes both sharks and whales. Though, the largest whales aren’t included in this group, as the upper level of the band is just 10 million tokens, which is worth around $3.4 million at the current exchange rate. From the graph, it’s apparent that the number of investors belonging to this key group has gone up recently, and the metric’s value now stands at 1,617, which is an all-time high. The percentage of the total XRP supply held by this cohort has observed an even sharper uptrend this month, as these sharks and whales now account for around 7.23% of the total tokens in circulation, which is also a new record.

42413403,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8ZZU,1671631200,Built on Bitcoin in 2022: Top Bitcoin Newsletter Publishes Its Year-End Review,"Ethereum merged, decentralized finance (DeFi) imploded, FTX crashed and burned. Bitcoin, in the meantime, continued to build, said the Bitcoin Operations Technology Group (Optech) – a community of Bitcoin contributors – in its annual year-end review.  The paper covers dozens of milestones: from ambitious scaling proposals such as validity rollups and the Taro test software, to captivating events like the establishment of a Bitcoin legal defense fund by Block CEO Jack Dorsey and a controversial Lightning Network Daemon (LND) bug that left part of the Lightning Network in disarray.  Amid these developments, Optech highlighted three major themes that sparked both vigorous debate and vigorous coding: replace-by-fee, or RBF (a way to replace unconfirmed Bitcoin transactions), several soft fork proposals and 16 major Bitcoin ecosystem software releases.  Key milestones  Taro, a new piece of software (currently under early testing) that will allow Bitcoin developers to create, send and receive assets on the Bitcoin blockchain (think stablecoins on Bitcoin), may be the most interesting of the milestones.  Read more: Lightning Labs Releases Software to Allow Bitcoin Developers to Mint and Transfer Assets on the Blockchain  Others include validity rollups first floated by Bitcoin researcher John Light. A validity rollup would combine large numbers of transactions off-chain, validate those transactions, then submit the validated batch as a single “rolled up” transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain.  Chaos broke out in November when Twitter user “Burak” (@brqgoo) exploited a bug that took down a large swath of the Lightning Network, raising questions about how the Bitcoin community should handle similar vulnerabilities in the future.  Finally, Jack Dorsey, together with Alex Morcos and Martin White, established the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund. Dorsey announced the fund on the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list, describing it as “a nonprofit entity that aims to minimize legal headaches that discourage software developers from actively developing Bitcoin and related projects.”  Read more: Bitcoin After the Ethereum Merge: Experts Weigh In  Major themes  Replace-By-Fee (RBF)  One topic that seemed to polarize Bitcoiners all year long was the debate over Replace-By-Fee (RBF), a feature in Bitcoin Core that gives users the option to replace unconfirmed transactions with new transactions, as long as they’re willing to pay a higher fee for the replacement transaction. (Bitcoin Core is the dominant software used to connect to the Bitcoin network.)  Why would anyone want to replace an unconfirmed transaction? Imagine Bob desperately needs to send one bitcoin (BTC) to Alice during a period of peak transaction volume (say, during a surge in Binance withdrawals). Bitcoin transactions are typically confirmed – accepted into a block of transactions that gets added to the Bitcoin blockchain – every 10 minutes or so. It’s been over 30 minutes and three blocks have already been confirmed, but because the network is at peak volume, no miner has accepted Bob’s transaction because other transactions are paying miners much higher fees. (Bitcoin miners process transactions and secure the network.)  Bob’s unconfirmed transaction is officially “stuck.” With RBF, Bob can replace his original transaction and pay a higher fee to get it accepted by a miner.  There are two main flavors of RBF. Opt-in RBF allows Bob to mark or “flag” his unconfirmed transactions as replaceable or not replaceable. Full RBF simply makes all unconfirmed transactions replaceable.  Here’s where the controversy lies. According to some Bitcoin business owners, certain vendors are willing to accept riskier unconfirmed transactions because they deal with low value goods and services. Those vendors have strategically optimized their operations to minimize the risk from these zero confirmation (unconfirmed) transactions. The catch, though, is that optimization is only based on opt-in RBF and not full RBF.  Other bitcoiners argue zero-confirmation fraud is a risk independent of RBF. Whatever the case may be, full RBF (menu option “mempoolfullrbf”) was introduced in Bitcoin Core version 24.0 last month. However, it’s switched off by default, meaning node operators running the Bitcoin Core software must proactively switch it on if they want to make all transactions replaceable.  Soft fork proposals  Soft forks are upgrades to a blockchain that are backwards-compatible. Nodes (computers on the Bitcoin network) that don’t upgrade still view the upgraded chain as valid (all nodes are still one big happy family).  Conversely, hard forks result in a permanent change to the blockchain that isn’t backwards-compatible (nodes either accept the change or split off onto a separate blockchain).  Bitcoin developers prefer adding new features to Bitcoin via soft forks rather than hard forks (unlike Ethereum developers).  According to Optech, there was significant interest in soft fork proposals, especially around CheckTemplateVerify (CTV), a proposal by developer Jeremy Rubin, and AnyPrevOut (APO), a proposal by developers Christian Decker and Anthony Towns.  CTV allows Bitcoin users to restrict or specify how their coins are spent, a concept known as a covenant. For example, a sender can use CTV to create a bitcoin cold storage vault that automatically releases a small amount of bitcoin to an assigned hot wallet on a scheduled basis (Rubin calls them structured liquidity vaults).  APO is a proposal for a new type of public key that allows certain adjustments to a transaction even after it’s signed. This could be applicable for use cases like Eltoo, a proposed enhancement to the Lightning Network (Bitcoin’s layer 2 scaling system).  Many of these proposals were discussed and updated but haven’t been implemented. Vibrant discussions are continuing.  Major Bitcoin ecosystem software releases  It was a busy year for Bitcoin builders. Optech lists 16 major software releases in 2022 from 8 Bitcoin ecosystem projects:  Bitcoin Core, the dominant software used to connect to the Bitcoin network  Lightning Network Daemon (LND), an open-source project launched by Lightning infrastructure firm, Lightning Labs  Core Lightning (CLN), an open-source Lightning project launched by Bitcoin infrastructure firm, Blockstream  Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK), a software library for Bitcoin wallets  Lightning Development Kit (LDK), a software library for Lightning nodes  Eclair, a Lightning project by Bitcoin technology firm ACINQ  BTCPayServer, an open-source bitcoin payment processor  Rust Bitcoin, a Bitcoin development software library  Of all these releases, Bitcoin Core version 24.0, which introduced full RBF, may have been the most impactful, or at least the most talked about.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | FORKS,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/21/built-on-bitcoin-in-2022-top-bitcoin-newsletter-publishes-its-year-end-review,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/53797d76cb0ab49f0f5e40d9e94e90f83560ac9d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange is one of the largest peer-to-peer crypto trading platforms in the world, and Youssef says he has a big responsibility to his 11.6 million customers. Youssef wrote on Twitter today: We finally kicked Ethereum off our marketplace. 11.6m humans safer. Integrity over revenue. Who is next? The Paxful CEO further explained, “We need maximum momentum behind one clearing layer to win and Bitcoin is the only game in town.

Integrity over revenue 🤝🏽 Who is next ? pic.twitter.com/JTJXa5RYJ8 — Ray Youssef (@raypaxful) December 21, 2022 The Reasons Behind The Anti-Ethereum Decision In a newsletter, the Paxful CEO explained the backstory behind his decision to remove Ethereum from the exchange as early as 12:00 UTC on Thursday, Dec. 22. Under the tagline “Revenue is nice, but integrity trumps all,” Youssef describes economic apartheid as the “biggest problem in the world.” It is, according to the Paxful CEO, “the root of all humanity’s suffering.” That’s why, as CEO of Paxful, he strives for a world “where Bitcoin frees billions of people held back by this evil system, especially those unnecessarily harmed living in the Global South”. Related Reading: Ethereum (ETH) Will Overtake Bitcoin, At Least Temporarily: Analysts Predict According to Youssef, there are ultimately three key arguments for why ETH does not support this mission (anymore) and is bad for the Bitcoin industry. The first reason Youssef cites is Ethereum’s shift from proof of work to proof of stake. “Proof of work is the innovation that makes Bitcoin the only honest money there is, whereas proof of stake has rendered ETH essentially a digital form of fiat,” the CEO of Paxful claims. Referring to the Tornado Cash censorship and the Ethereum Foundation, Youssef goes on to state that ETH is controlled by a small group of people, while “one day you will need permission to use it.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price Bearish Signal: ETH Below 100 SMA Could Trigger Downside The third argument is the scams that have emerged with Ethereum’s capabilities. While Youssef concedes ETH has “some utility for real-world use cases,” he says the tokens Ethereum has spawned are scams that have “robbed people of billions.” Ultimately, the developments of the past years have set the Bitcoin industry back years. “They have stolen valuable momentum away from Bitcoin and cost us years on our mission,” Youssef explained. Ethereum Price Near Key Resistance The decision of Paxful is likely to arrive rather controversially in the crypto community, while it will find applause in the ranks of Bitcoin maxis. Meanwhile, numerous experts, including Bloomberg Intelligence’s Mike McGlone, predict that ETH could outperform and even flip the largest cryptocurrency by market cap in the next bull market, at least temporarily. At press time, ETH was trading at $1,215. Thus, the price is sitting just below key resistance at the $1,220 mark.

Among the reasons for the move noted by Youssef was the Ethereum network's switch to proof-of-stake validation from proof-of-work.  ""Proof-of-work is the innovation that makes bitcoin (BTC) the only honest money there is, whereas proof-of-stake has rendered ETH essentially a digital form of fiat,"" he claimed.

Bitcoin And Stablecoins Dominance Rises As Altcoins Struggle As per the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the cryptocurrency market has observed a correlated decline recently, but altcoins have taken a more substantial hit. The “Altcoin Indexes” here refer to groups of altcoins divided on the basis of market cap. The most popular indexes include the “large caps,” the “mid caps,” and the “small caps.” As their names already imply, they cover coins from different-sized segments of the sector. Here is a chart that shows how these market-cap weighted Altcoin Indexes, as well as Bitcoin, have performed during the last month: The values of all these assets seem to have gone down in recent days | Source: Arcane Research's Ahead of the Curve - December 20 As you can see in the above graph, the cryptocurrency market has shown a strong inner correlation recently, as the altcoins have mostly maintained a close rhythm with Bitcoin during the last 30 days. This correlation was especially apparent in the selloff during the past week, as all the Altcoin Indexes sharply fell in tandem with BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bearish Signal: ‘Mid-Term’ Holders Show Signs Of Dumping Following this latest decline, the large-cap index is 2% underwater for the month, while BTC is still slightly in the green during this period. Both the mid-caps and the small caps have taken on large losses, as their returns in the last 30 days stand at -7% and -9%, respectively. This disparity in the performance between the altcoins and Bitcoin suggests that investors have been rotating their investments from the risky alts, back into a relatively-safer option in BTC. It would also appear that the largest altcoins still saw some interest from holders, as their returns haven’t been too far off from BTC.

42420797,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWYH9x,1671624000,Is Ethereum’s Censorship Problem Taking a Turn?,"Ethereum’s “censorship” problem has grown over the past few months, with some validators in charge of maintaining the blockchain’s ledger ignoring certain transactions to comply with regulations. But crypto’s anti-censorship purists may have reason to be hopeful.  In the past 24 hours, 66% of blocks that made it onto the Ethereum blockchain were OFAC-compliant, meaning they excluded transactions involving parties sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Traditional institutions typically comply with government sanctions, but in the idealistic world of crypto what some call compliance others call censorship. As more and more Ethereum validators choose to comply with OFAC, sanctioned transactions are taking longer to make it onto Ethereum’s chain, and ideological purists are arguing the network is beginning to fall short on its founding commitments to financial freedom and neutrality.  But the tide may be turning, with the number of censored blocks on Ethereum seeing a steady decline between mid-November and mid-December. According to mevwatch.info, a watchdog site for monitoring Ethereum “censorship”, the highest number of censored blocks came on Nov. 21, when 79% of blocks relayed on Ethereum came from parties that exclude OFAC-sanctioned transactions. Since then, the lowest day was Dec. 9, when censored blocks made up 64%. Most days censorship sits at 68% to 72%.  So what is causing the steady decrease in OFAC-compliant blocks? In addition to community backlash against censorship, there are now more OFAC-agnostic ways of using MEV-Boost – a piece of third-party software that pre-assembles blocks for Ethereum validators.  What’s the problem with MEV-Boost?  Ever since the Ethereum Merge in September, most of the blocks that make it onto the blockchain pass through a middleware component called MEV-Boost, a piece of software that allows validators – those who propose and approve “blocks” of transactions to Ethereum’s ledger – to request pre-made blocks from a network of builders.  MEV-Boost was originally built to help validators extract MEV, or Maximal Extractible Value – additional profit that block builders and validators can receive from strategically reordering or including transactions within a block.  The software, which was built by Ethereum research and development firm Flashbots, was born out of the firm’s efforts to solve some issues created by MEV, including centralization and censorship. It ​​was supposed to make it possible for any Ethereum validator, large or small, to easily bite out a piece of the MEV pie.  In large part, it has succeeded in its goal. Whereas MEV might have only been accessible to the most sophisticated validators had MEV-Boost not existed, the software is today used by 91% of Ethereum’s validators.  But problems arose with MEV-Boost after OFAC sanctioned the Ethereum mixer program Tornado Cash in August.  Many blockchain developers were outraged by the sanctioning of Tornado Cash. Writing code is seen by them as a form of free speech, and they viewed the banning of smart contracts as a form of censorship. But not all of the businesses and individuals that operate Ethereum’s infrastructure (e.g., its validators) were eager to test OFAC’s enforcement resolve.  Validators that use MEV-Boost must select a third-party “relayer” tasked with delivering them pre-built blocks. Some of these relayers, out of sensitivity toward OFAC, automatically filter out blocks containing Tornado Cash transactions. These “censored” relayers included Flashbots’ own relay, the one that most users of the MEV-Boost platform tend to use by default.  As a result of the proliferation of OFAC-compliant relays, Tornado Cash transactions were taking longer than usual to make it onto Ethereum because those transactions needed to find other ways to be included on the blockchain.  Read more: As Censorship on Ethereum Begins, Could This Open-Sourced Code Help Counter It?  If enough validators (or relays) refuse to process OFAC-sanctioned transactions, it is conceivable that those transactions might eventually become censored from the chain entirely.  So in the weeks since this has all taken place, what has the community done to try to reverse Ethereum’s censorship course?  New players in the game  The effort to push for relay diversity has intensified. On Oct. 14, 81% of blocks relayed with MEV-Boost did so via the Flashbots relay. Today, that number sits at 74%.  Since the last time I wrote about MEV-Boost, four new relayers that are noncensoring have entered the market. Those relayers are Agnostic, Relayoor, Ultrasound and Aestus.  Although they currently make up a tiny fraction of blocks relayed, there’s now greater diversity for validators to connect with (six of the 10 relays that are now available are noncensoring).  The Agnostic relay was introduced by the team behind Gnosis Chain. Its co-founder, Stefan George, told CoinDesk: “We see a significant value added in Ethereum being a credibly neutral platform. This is at risk if most validators conform to censorship requirements by a particular jurisdiction.”  George added: “There was the argument made that even in a scenario where 90% [of blocks] are censoring, it is still censorship resistant because you have to wait longer for your block to be mined, but we saw this as a weak argument as neutrality is lost and certain transactions are favored over others. This is why we criticized the direction and started offering this relay as a constructive step to improve the network.”  Read more: FTX Blowup Helped Enrich the Ethereum Validators Who Run the Blockchain  Others attribute the decline in censorship to the fact that validators are more willing to connect to relays that are not Flashbots, now that they have become more comfortable with the MEV-Boost space.  Uri Klarman, CEO of bloXroute, which runs three relayers, two of which are noncensoring, told CoinDesk that “the main reason we're seeing the censorship percentage decreasing is because more and more validators connect to bloXroute's relays, which are now providing 20% to 25% of the blocks.”  George of Gnosis Chain also believes that “most validators used the Flashbots relay mostly out of convenience and not because they required OFAC compliance. That's why it was only an operational issue for them to switch once an alternative became available.” George added that “the public sentiment certainly helped to make this change happen faster.”",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/12/21/is-ethereums-censorship-problem-taking-a-turn,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/412318d98b473ed56095ae53748d96b5b1c34973-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Further, he stated that he is generally an advocate of Ethereum as it has a lot of use cases as a decentralized app network. “But I’m not one of the believers in ultra sound money,” Alexander continued, stating that the meme that ETH is a better version of Bitcoin and a better version of money, in his opinion, completely misses the point of game theory and psychology of crypto. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst Not a meme, on the other hand, is a supply squeeze that Ethereum will see at some point, he said. “I think it’s a great tech investment. And I think the tokenomics are great and that we’ll see a supply squeeze at some point. It’s not just a meme. At some point you will run out of coins and where we will see an explosive movement,” Alexander predicted. For retail investors, Alexander recommended that they allocate half of their capital to Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a weighting of 60% ETH and 40% BTC, considering the current market conditions. The remainder he would allocate to identifying new narratives. Ethereum (ETH) Could Outperform Bitcoin Not only the CIO of Selini Capital but also the senior analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, Mike McGlone, predicts an outperformance of Ethereum versus Bitcoin. McGlone stated yesterday that Ethereum could be the top candidate to keep topping the first-born cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Could A Litecoin Fractal Foretell A New Bull Trend In Crypto? “Ethereum’s advances vs. Bitcoin have been unshaken by 2022 deflation in most risk assets and may be gaining underpinnings,” McGlone said. As the Bloomberg analyst notes, the Ethereum/Bitcoin ratio is currently around 0.08, the same level as in May 2021, when the Nasdaq 100 stock index was about 20% higher. Our graphic shows the trend of the no. 2 cryptocurrency outperforming no 1, which appeared coincident with the rise of risk assets. […] Migration into the mainstream is our takeaway, and once dust settles from some reversion in risk assets amid inflation pressures, Ethereum is more likely to resume doing what it has been — outperforming. Chris Burniske who led ARK Invest’s crypto efforts and is now a partner at Placeholder VC commented: ETH will make its most serious attempt yet for #1 position next expansion. The expert referred to a tweet by Ryan Berckmans, in which he outlined that Ethereum is well on its way to the flippening. “The ratio has never done so well in a bear market,” Berckmans stated. At press time, the Ethereum price stood at $ 1,211 and was rejected at crucial resistance at $1,220.

The plan was announced in June, and was touted as a ""historic merger"" that would create a A$1.5 billion (US$10 billion) ""digital and traditional finance powerhouse"" and bring over 800,000 customers under one roof.  The cancelation comes after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) sued three crypto-related entities – BlockEarner, BPS Financial, the company behind the qoin digital token, and financial product comparison website Finder.com. The government, meantime, is taking steps toward tightening crypto rules next year by inviting comments and feedback for a consultation paper.  “The volatility in the market as well as the current regulatory environment has made it increasingly difficult to achieve the initial vision that inspired the merger earlier this year,"" Superhero CEO John Winter said. ""Superhero will return to being independently owned by myself and my co-founder Wayne Baskin.""  The environment isn't helped by the collapse of several high-profile companies, including crypto exchange FTX and crypto lender Voyager Digital and a decline in the crypto market. Earlier this month, Swyftx cut 90 jobs or 35% of its total workforce because of the market downturn.  ""The ongoing regulatory uncertainty around crypto-assets, combined with rising regulation-by-enforcement, does not encourage an environment where mergers of more traditional businesses and crypto-native companies can easily take place,” said Michael Bacina, a partner at law firm Piper Alderman who is not involved in the transaction, in a WhatsApp message.

42413399,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8ZVk,1671616383,Next Financial Crisis Will Be From Crypto if It's Not Banned: Indian Central Bank Governor,"India's central bank Governor Shaktikanta Das has predicted that the next financial crisis will come from ""private cryptocurrencies"" if they are allowed to be regulated and not banned outright. Das was speaking at the Business Standard BFSI Insight Summit on Wednesday.  ""Our view is that it should be prohibited because if you try to regulate it and allow it to grow, please mark my words the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,"" Das said. ""They have no underlying value. They have huge inherent risks for our macro economic and financial stability. I am yet to hear any credible argument about what public good or what public purpose it serves.""  The term ""private cryptocurrencies"" is being used to make the distinction between a public cryptocurrency such as India's CBDC and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, which are issued by private players, people familiar with the central bank’s functioning told CoinDesk.  ""I think the term private cryptocurrency is a fashionable way of describing what is otherwise a 100% speculative activity and there is a talk that it should be regulated,"" Das said.  The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) governor has previously stated that cryptocurrencies should be prohibited. These comments assume significance at a time when the nation is holding the presidency of the Group of 20 (G-20) nations, giving it the power to set the agenda. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said how to regulate crypto assets should be an international priority and will be a big topic of discussion during its G-20 presidency.  The RBI's entourage of more than 20 people, according to sources, has been attending these G-20 meetings in India over the past few days where different nations are presenting their views on how to regulate the space.  ""Countries have been taking different views,"" said Das. ""I don't think we need to say anything more about our stand after the developments over the last one year including the latest episode around FTX.""  The governor's comments also come at a time when the RBI is trying to create awareness around its CBDC, the e-rupee or digital rupee, and is facing questions around whether CBDCs are in competition with private cryptocurrencies.  ""It's not a question of fear of missing out or of offering competition to a private cryptocurrency. I think that is how the world is going to evolve, said Das when asked whether India's CBDC was an ""optic to fight crypto."" ""You will see in days to come more and more central banks will embrace digital currencies and India has been in the forefront of the digital revolution in the current century.""  Previously, Das said the warning bells sounded by the Indian central bank persuaded people to avoid cryptocurrencies.

There seems to be no love for crypto this year-end, as Santa has refused to show up.

The general market capitalization across all digital assets is down around 2.6% monthly, at $774 billion. Crypto total market cap stands at $770 billion on daily chart. Source: TradingView The Bitcoin jump to $16,800 was a faint attempt at a bullish rally. The cryptocurrency continues to experience more downside, falling to its lowest in 3 weeks. Ethereum added 3.5% on Tuesday, having closed 130 basis points (bps) lower on Monday. The second largest crypto by market cap rose into the $1,200 region. ETH seems to collide with higher resistance at the $1,230 level. This could be challenging with the 14-day RSI now hovering directly below a ceiling of 47,000.

42413404,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl8ZaQ,1671614228,"Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Files for Bankruptcy, Expects Support From Some Debt Holders","Core Scientific (CORZ), one of the largest bitcoin (BTC) miners by computing power, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and reached a deal with some of its lenders to restructure its debt.  The company filed for Chapter 11 at Southern District of Texas bankruptcy court as crypto winter continues to take its toll on the industry. The miner's estimated liabilities are between $1 billion-$10 billion, according to the filing. It has around 1,000-5,000 creditors, with the largest unsecured claim coming from investment bank B. Riley.  The miner's estimated assets are between $1 billion-$10 billion, according to the filing. At the end of the third quarter, Core Scientific's assets stood at $1.4 billion, whereas its liabilities were about $1.3 billion, according to its earnings report.  The bankruptcy of Core Scientific, which accounts for about 10% of computing power on the bitcoin network, operating 143,000 mining rigs and hosting another 100,000 is the biggest one yet and is set to send shockwaves in an already crumbling industry.  Prepackaged bankruptcy  Core Scientific reached an agreement with some of its creditors, in what appears to be a prepackaged bankruptcy. In a prepackaged bankruptcy, the debtor reaches some sort of agreement with its debtee before officially filling for bankruptcy.  The miner expects support from some of its convertible noteholders in the form of two debtor-in-possession (DIP) facilities, totaling up to $75 million, Core Scientific said in a press release. This support will help it go through the bankruptcy process, which it intends to do ""swiftly,"" the press release said. The miner had $544 million in convertible notes outstanding at the end of the third quarter.  Existing convertible note holders will ""equitize their debt into a significant majority of the common stock of the reorganized company,"" the mining firm said. Other holders of general unsecured claims and existing common shareholders will also ""receive meaningful recoveries in the form of reorganized common stock and warrants"" under the restructuring deal.  The company first warned of the risk of bankruptcy in late October, and said it wouldn't be paying some of its loan installments, sending its shares plummeting about 80% on Nasdaq. In November, it reiterated that it may run out of money by the end of this year.  Last week, investment bank B. Riley proposed a $72 million financing plan, including $40 million of financing ""immediately"" and with ""zero contingencies."" However, the rest of the funding would be made available once bitcoin hit $18,500. Core Scientific has $42 million outstanding to the bank.  Instead, Core Scientific expects to seal a deal with a group representing ""more than 50% of the holders of its convertible notes"" that will grant it $56 million in a DIP facility. The noteholders have agreed to syndicate up to ""$19 million in new money DIP Facility loans to all holders of convertible notes,"" the Wednesday press release said.  ""These funds, along with ongoing cash generated from operations, are anticipated to provide the necessary financing to effectuate the planned restructuring, facilitate the emergence from Chapter 11, and cover the fees and expenses of legal and financial advisors,"" the miner said.  Core Scientific's operations ""remain significantly cash flow positive on a debt-free basis,"" the press release said.  Crypto winter devastates miners  Core Scientific is one of several miners struggling to keep afloat as rising energy prices increase costs, while stubbornly low bitcoin prices slash revenue. Compute North, another major firm in the space, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in late September.  Iris Energy (IREN) had to unplug about 72% of its computing power that was tied to just over $100 million of loans that it defaulted on. The loans were held by special-purpose non-recourse vehicles. In November, Argo Blockchain's (ARBK) deal to sell $27 million of equity to fund operations fell through and the company was subsequently downgraded by two analysts. Greenidge Generation (GREE) on Tuesday announced a debt restructuring deal with its lender NYDIG, but could still run out of cash in two months if it doesn't secure additional funding.  Core Scientific has also been affected by the bankruptcy of lender Celsius Network's mining arm, one of its biggest clients, and lender BlockFi, to which it owes $54 million. Celsius Mining filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July and in September sued Core Scientific, claiming that it violated automatic stay terms. Core Scientific claims Celsius owes it $5.2 million as of Sept. 30. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late November, one of many victims of crypto exchange FTX's implosion.  Core Scientific was running 243,000 machines in its facilities as of the end of October, split between 14.4 exahash per second (EH/s) of bitcoin self-mining hashrate, and 10 EH/s of hosted machines for other firms, according to the filing. That's about 10% of the global hashrate, which stands at around 243 EH/s as of the time of writing.  The company went public in Jan. 20 after merging with Power & Digital Infrastructure Acquisition in a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) transaction.  Shares of Core Scientific were down over 27% at $0.1519, during pre-market trading.

The digital currency dropped to $16,400, its lowest level in the last three weeks. As year-end approaches, BTC could face high volatility and low liquidity. Bitcoin Hit A Brief Surge Bitcoin surged to a short-lived peak of $16,837 in today’s session, barely 24 hours after hitting $16,398. The cryptocurrency saw an impulsive decline after experiencing significant rejection at the resistance level. The sharp fall has been associated with a straight daily decline for the S&P 500 and general nervousness about the Federal Reserve’s potential to hike interest rates. BTC/USD trades at $16,870 on the daily chart. Source: TradingView BTC could witness more decline as the year closes given the decline in trading volume and liquidity. This would lead to a spike in the volatility of the asset. Katie Stockton, the founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, has predicted that BTC could retest November lows, dropping “near $15,600, in the coming weeks.” BTC hit an all-time high of $68,997 on Nov. 8, 2021. But the big crypto produced a major shift in market structure by producing a lower low on the weekly timeframe at $32,995 on January 24. This move confirmed the start of a bear market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Poised To Resume Its Inclination To Outperform, Says Bloomberg Senior Analyst Possible Rally For BTC While the dust settles from the FTX crash and FUD surrounding Binance, the bitcoin price could begin to see a gradual recovery over the next few months. According to Jim Wyckoff, “Neither the bulls nor the bears have any near-term technical advantage.” This suggests that traders will continue to see “more choppy and sideways trading on the daily chart into the end of the year – barring any major fundamental shock to the marketplace,” Wyckoff concluded. However, a tweet by Crypto Trader, PlanB shows that the next Bitcoin halving is set to take place in 15 months. The build-up in price will not happen for at least 5 months as the U.S. FED will continue to tighten up monetary policy. BTC price will have room to breathe as macroeconomic conditions soften. Schroders, a global asset management firm, made the case that risky assets like Bitcoin have a nearly 80% chance of closing the year with positive returns. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still “Overvalued” According To NVT Ratio The investment firm noted that December was the best-performing month after collecting data on U.S. large-cap stocks since 1926. Schroders estimates that there is a 77.9% likelihood that large-cap stocks will end December with a net gain. The company divides all percentage gains vs. all percentage losses over the course of a month to arrive at these metrics. Investors should keep in mind that this year, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market has been over 90%. It may be argued that until the end of the year, the peer-to-peer digital currency will continue to reflect price changes on the stock market. Bitcoin is down 2% from December’s opening price of $17,167. Thus, following Schroders’ analysis, Bitcoin may rise by 3.5% to reach $17,550 by Jan. 1, 2023.

While many mining companies have experienced financial distress during the bear market, Core Scientific is the first publicly listed company to declare bankruptcy. On Tuesday, bitcoin miner Greenridge reached a debt restructuring deal with NYDIG that will allow the firm to avoid bankruptcy for now.  Compute North, which operates data centers that host many miners' operations, filed for bankruptcy in September. Generate Capital, a financier of Compute North, said the firm asserted several ""technical events of default"" in July as crypto prices plummeted during the implosion of Three Arrows Capital. Marathon Digital, a rival of Core Scientific, said that it only expects to recover less than half of the $50 million it deposited with Compute North for services.  In October, Binance Pool launched a $500 million fund that would provide emergency financing for distressed miners, collateralizing the loans with physical assets as well as the crypto mined by the companies. Bitmain has also launched a $250 million fund with a similar mandate.  Core Scientific's stock is down 98% on-year, while rival Riot Blockchain (RIOT) is down 83%, and Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) is down 88%.  Earlier in December, investment bank B Riley proposed a $72 million financing plan that would allow for Core Scientific to avoid bankruptcy.  ""In our opinion, the vast majority of Core Scientific's issues are self-imposed and can be corrected in conjunction with an open, transparent discussion and ongoing participation with its creditors and equity holders,"" B Riley said in a statement.  In early November, bondholders began working with restructuring attorneys at Paul Hastings to propose an alternative to bankruptcy, Bloomberg reported at the time. Later that month the company reported that it ended October with $32 million in cash and warned it might run out of cash by year's end due to the rising cost of financing, soaring energy prices, and a compressed price of bitcoin.  Core Scientific maintains positive cashflow, but its income, impacted by the bear market, is not enough to cover financing costs of its mining equipment.  The price of bitcoin remained flat throughout most of the Asia trading day, up 0.27% at $16,840, according to CoinDesk data.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: As the end of the year approaches, there's growing speculation that more digital-asset investors might eschew altcoins in favor of major currencies like bitcoin and ether, rotating toward a defensive allocation.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  With bitcoin listless, crypto investors look ahead to 2023  By Bradley Keoun  There's neither energy nor much enthusiasm in crypto markets as traders head toward the end of 2022.  Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was softening a touch into the early Asia trading day, though was still up 0.6% over the past 24 hours. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain and the second-largest overall, was up 1.4%.  Gloom pervades digital-asset markets as the crypto industry recovers from this year's stunning collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, while the Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and other central banks are continuing to ratchet monetary conditions tighter, even as signs mount that the U.S. economy might be heading into a recession next year. (ICYMI here is CoinDesk's fourth-quarter Market Outlook published Tuesday, spotlighting the performance of the CoinDesk Market Index and sectors.)  ""Bitcoin’s rally is somewhat unimpressive as crypto traders continue to remain in wait-and-see mode over what will be the next big crypto domino to fall or if we get any clearer guidance over the regulatory front,"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst at the foreign-exchange broker Oanda, wrote Tuesday.  Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer at the digital-asset manager Arca Funds, wrote in his newsletter this week that ""while I do think the bottom is in, I don't know what sends us higher.""  There's growing speculation that the biggest cryptocurrencies – bitcoin and ether, mainly – might benefit from the market malaise, as investors rotate toward defensive positions.  ""We expect digital asset selection will transition towards higher quality names like bitcoin and ether based on factors like sustainable tokenomics, the maturity of respective ecosystems and relative market liquidity,"" Coinbase Institutional Head of Research David Duong wrote Tuesday in a report. ""We think investors’ willingness to accumulate altcoins has been severely impacted by the deleveraging in 2022 and may take many months to fully recuperate.""  Insights  BitDAO’s $100M token buyback proposal spurs community concerns  By Shaurya Malwa  Community members of BitDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) focused on driving adoption of its native BIT token ecosystem, this week proposed to set its Target Daily Purchase Amount (TDPA) at 2 million tether (USDT) per day for 50 days starting Jan. 1, 2023.  The purchase amounts to a total purchase of 100 million USDT of BIT. BitDAO is styled as an open platform for proposals that are voted on by BIT token holders, and is agnostic to chains and projects, as per technical documents.  According to the proposal, the recommended priorities for BitDAO capital deployment include high priority for BIT-related products and low priority for swaps and investments, as well as yield strategies.  The DAO's treasury currently holds 300 million in USDT and USD coin (USDC), and 270,000 ether (ETH), valued at approximately $345 million, which is expected to be sufficient to cover at least five years of BIT product development.  BitDAO community members said that the original strategy for the collective was to grow the treasury via direct investments and the creation of BitDAO-like entities (sub-DAO/autonomous entities) and investments.  However, that strategy had a “questionable impact” on driving outcomes for BIT. “The most performant DAOs (Lido, Aave, Uni) have been centered on underlying core products that have large addressable markets and longevity,” the proposal stated, calling for higher priorities on “core products” related to BitDAO instead.  One such core product is the upcoming Ethereum layer 2 network Mantle, the proposal said. The initial development of Mantle has been bootstrapped by Bybit, one of BitDAO’s key backers, with the next phase being a DAO proposal and budget cycles for expanded development and go-to-market activities.  The proposal also recommended against pursuing complex financial derivatives such as swaps and investments that do not have strategic outcomes for BIT. The lack of flexibility for DAOs to negotiate competitive deals and limited options for post-investment legal and governance involvement once funds have been transferred were listed as key reasons for such a dissuasive move.  Additionally, the proposal advised against participating in yield strategies due to the high systemic risk in the crypto market and the difficulty in calculating fair prices and slippage for altcoins. The risks associated with capital deployment and liquidity constraints when unwinding positions are also cited as reasons for caution.  What is the community saying?  Responses on the currently live proposal remained mixed as of Wednesday morning.  “It is not a good idea to buyback at this price level,” one community member said, citing BIT’s token prices remaining above the net asset value of a basket of underlying ether, USDT and USDC.  “I’m afraid I have to disagree,” another poster said. “We should constantly buy back and burn. BIT tokens still don’t have demand, if we don’t buy back and burn BIT tokens will go to zero. Buyback and burn at least 2024 because every month 180 million tokens will release (sic).”  Some community members pointed out crypto exchange Bybit’s upcoming token incentive program as a cause for concern. “I have reservations about this repurchase,” wrote one member. “Bybit is about to issue a year-end bonus of 92 million BIT. At this time, BitDAO proposed to repurchase it, giving people the feeling that the treasury will pay for the year-end bonus.”  Important events  3:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(7:00 UTC) Germany Gfk Consumer Confidence Survey (Jan)  9:30 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:30 UTC) Bank of Canada Consumer Price Index Core (YoY/Nov)  11:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(15:00 UTC) United States Consumer Confidence (Dec)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  FTX Developments; Who Moved 100 Bitcoins Tied to Defunct Crypto Exchange QuadrigaCX?

The committee expects a response this week.  In February 2021, at the height of the bull market, Gemini partnered with Genesis to create Gemini Earn, which offered clients up to 7.4% interest on their crypto deposits. In mid-November, Genesis suspended withdrawals given the FTX-induced market turmoil, freezing Gemini Earn funds in the process.  “This decision was made in response to the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion,"" Amanda Cowie, vice president of communications and marketing at DCG, said at the time. ""This decision impacts the lending business at Genesis and does not affect Genesis’s trading or custody businesses. Importantly, this decision has no impact on the business operations of DCG and our other wholly owned subsidiaries.""  DCG is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  Earlier reports pegged the value of the total amount owed to Gemini at $900 million, from a total of $1.8 billion owed to the creditors’ group.  ""Genesis is working with advisors to evaluate options to preserve client assets, strengthen our liquidity, and move the business forward for the long-term. As we continue to work to identify a holistic solution, our priority remains working toward the best outcome for Genesis’s clients and other stakeholders. This is a comprehensive process that we anticipate will take additional weeks rather than days for us to arrive at a path forward,” a Genesis spokesperson said in a statement.  Investment bank Houlihan Lokey has been retained as a financial adviser on behalf of the Creditor Committee, with law firms Kirkland & Ellis and Proskauer Rose acting as counsel for the creditors.

This is a move the company hopes will close the gap between the GBTC share price and the company’s underlying Bitcoin holdings. Grayscale Can’t Act Independent Of Investors The Wall Street Journal released a letter by Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein urging that Grayscale would consider issuing a tender offer should the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) and shareholders give their approval. Being a close-ended fund, GBTC shareholders can only liquidate their holdings on the open market. Under the Williams Act (part of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that governs tender offers in the US, an investor tendering for a security must disclose their source of funds, legal agreements related to the offer, and reasons for the offer. GBTC trades at $8.08 on the 24-hour chart. Source: TradingView If the company cannot return GBTC shareholders funds, it will continue to offer the tender until it’s converted to an ETF. Sonnenshein wrote to investors: In the event we are unsuccessful in pursuing options for returning a portion of the capital to shareholders, we do not currently intend to dissolve GBTC, but would instead continue to operate GBTC without an ongoing redemption program until we are successful in converting it to a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with the SEC after its application to convert GBTC to a spot Bitcoin ETF on June 29, 2022. The letter by the CEO was an attempt to ease shareholder concerns after a turbulent few months across the crypto market. Related Reading: GBTC Unlocks Spells Doom For Bitcoin? Top Expert Breaks It Down ETF Conversion Seems To Be Only Option As it stands, Grayscale doesn’t have a specific timeline for when it may explore other options apart from the ETF conversion. The lawsuit seems to be a long-drawn battle. Grayscale filed its opening brief against the SEC on Oct. 11, 2022. In response, SEC filed a brief on Dec. 13, 2022 denying Grayscale’s accusations that its rejection was discriminatory and arbitrary. The firm has until Jan. 13, 2023 to respond. Afterwards, a three-judge panel will be selected to listen to oral arguments and rule on the case. Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust has roughly $10.78 billion or 633,000 BTC in assets under management. The fund has failed to meet its goal, and it’s currently changing hands at a 48.8% discount to Bitcoin. Source: YCharts Sonnenshein didn’t clarify if the business may later sell off its Bitcoin holdings. However, a market dump like Grayscale could see Bitcoin crashin to a fresh yearly low. Grayscale selling off its Bitcoin stash could also drive down confidence in crypto as significant liquidations for those engaged in Bitcoin derivatives markets. This would hurt crypto volumes, and send a bearish crypto market further down.
