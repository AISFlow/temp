42402997,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde2Eu,1559944850,Stolen Bitfinex BTC Is on the Move,"Stolen bitcoins have been spotted moving on the blockchain after three years of lying dormant.  In a series of transactions beginning at 06:00 UTC Friday, 172.54 BTC or about $1.37 million moved from a wallet that had previously held funds taken in the 2016 Bitfinex hack. The theft, which cost the exchange $60 million, remains unsolved.  The Twitter handle Whale_Alert noted the transfers this morning. They continued throughout the day, ending with a $137,514 transaction at 19:47 UTC.  Hard Fork  posited that the move was connected with Bitfinex's Leo token, which allows for the anonymous return of stolen funds. Bitfinex spokesperson Anneka Dew denied that the exchange was involved in the move.  “We are not involved, and the movement is not tied to the procedure outlined in the UNUS SED LEO white paper,” she said.  Given the anonymous nature of bitcoin wallets, these moves are the only evidence of hacker activity after the theft. They can be used for forensic analysis by blockchain sleuths but often instead result in money laundering activity to hide the funds' ultimate destination.  The Bitfinex theft was the largest loss of bitcoins by an exchange since the Mt. Gox hack in early 2014 (worth $350 million). In February of this year, U.S. law enforcement retrieved 27.66270285 BTC that had been taken from Bitfinex.

42402984,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde254,1559930424,Vancouver Saw the First-Ever Bitcoin ATM. Now Its Mayor Wants to Ban Them,"Bitcoin ATMs have become “an ideal money-laundering vehicle,” according to the Vancouver Police Department, prompting a proposed city-wide ban by the mayor, and potential federal legislation, The Star reports.  The 76 machines within the city limits have come under police fire twice already this past year due to perceived regulatory issues. Though, most recently in February 2019, Sergeant Alvin Shum took aim not only at Bitcoin ATMs, but also the ideological underpinnings of blockchain generally. He wrote, in a report to the Vancouver Police Board:  “Given the lack of a central authority, there is no controlling organization who can monitor or regulate the transfer of funds to ensure a legitimate transaction. This creates a prime opportunity for the criminal element to capitalize on remaining anonymous, as they work to defraud unsuspecting citizens, launder money, and make large-sum anonymous transactions.”  This lack of regulation, Shum said, will allow for the incubation of organized and petty crime. Indeed, he points to the rising trend of cryptocurrency police filings in Vancouver year over year, which increased 350% from 2016 to 2017, and saw a further 250% increase in 2018.  Current reporting rates indicate the Metro Police will receive 840 reports this year, on track for a 300% increase in reports from 2018.  It is unclear how many of these crimes were directly tied to the use of cryptocurrency ATMs, though Shum spoke of a “high-pressure” tactic employed by fraudsters to direct victims to withdraw large amounts of cash and deposit it in a Bitcoin ATM to a predefined Bitcoin address. These scams target the most vulnerable segments of the population including recent immigrants and the elderly.  Since Shum wrote to the police council, 15 new machines have been added to the Vancouver metro area, according to coinatmradar.com.  In January, the city council suggested a bylaw to “regulate the use and operation of cryptocurrency ATMs, including the requirement for a business licence, requirement for signage to advertise common frauds, requirement for identifications to be used to verify the sender and receiver of funds and requirement of security features.”  Four months later, at a May 28 council meeting, Mayor Kennedy Stewart pushed for the outright ban crypto ATMs in the city. Defenders of the machines cite the utility for people who have transaction limits on their bank accounts, and the convenience for conducting cryptocurrency transactions. The third largest metropolitan area in Canada, Vancouver only hosts about 12% of the nation's total crypto ATMs.  The first bitcoin ATM ever was installed at a Vancouver coffee shop in 2013, which contained a built-in palm scanner designed to prevent users from processing more than $3000 CAD per day.  “We don’t want drug dealers sending a bunch of coke to the States and then withdrawing cash,” said one of the machine’s owners as it was unveiled at its location in 2013. “We don’t want these to turn into money laundering machines; that’s the worst thing that could happen.”  Currently, Vancouver lacks standardization for the types of transactions that can be performed on its ATMs. Some machines require a cellphone number and text verification for transactions over $1,000, while for others push the limit to $3,000, according to CoinATMRadar.com. A few machines advertise no limits at all, according to The Star.  A decision regarding the regulation, monitoring, or ban of crypto ATMs is currently being researched by city staff who will report back in the fourth quarter of 2019, Alvin Singh, the mayor’s director of communications, told The Star.

42402991,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde29z,1559925047,Reserve Bank of India Denies Involvement in Draft Bill to Ban Cryptocurrencies,"The Reserve Bank of India is denying any knowledge of a proposed ban on cryptocurrencies -- despite reports that a number of governmental agencies have backed the draft legislation -- according to a Right to Information request filed on June 4.  Varun Sethi, a lawyer specializing in blockchain, filed the inquiry into the RBI’s involvement with “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019"" draft, following a report from the Economic Times. The legislation would ban the sale, purchase, and issuance of all types of cryptocurrencies.  Bank officials said that the RBI was not in communication with governmental agencies during the legislative process and had not received a copy of the bill. The bank forwarded several of Sethi’s questions to the Department for Economic Affairs as well as the Ministry of Finance -- including, “What are ‘official digital currencies’ as per the RBI?”  The bank has been involved in cryptocurrency legislation as recently as April when the organization unveiled a regulatory sandbox that would allow blockchain products -- excluding digital currencies -- to be tested on a sample of consumers. It has not endorsed a full ban on cryptocurrencies in the past.  Several governmental initiatives within the world’s second-most populous nation have been undertaken to regulate blockchain, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi first established a panel to study how to regulate the crypto sector in November 2017.  The Economic Times reported that a committee in support of a total ban, including representatives of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), among others was “of the view that already there is a lot of delay in taking action against cryptocurrency.”  If passed, those who “mine, generate, hold, sell, transfer, dispose, issue or deal in cryptocurrencies directly or indirectly” could be jailed for up to 10 years.  The draft also advocates introduction of an official digital currency for India, the 'Digital Rupee,' that would presumably not land users in jail.

42402995,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde2Cw,1559923516,Ethereum Classic to Test Code for 'Atlantis' Upgrade This Month,"Ethereum classic developers are speeding up plans to test a proposed upgrade for the blockchain network.  The move to ramp up the timeline came during a developer call on Thursday, during which ecosystem stakeholders expressed a desire to see the system-wide upgrade -- dubbed ""Atlantis"" -- occur sometime later this summer. But rather than committing to a mainnet activation date more than two months in advance of the original proposed timeline, it was agreed that the testnet activation of Atlantis could be brought up to two weeks from Thursday, or June 19, instead of in early August.  ""The July 1st target is off. No need to further discuss that,"" concluded user ""soc1c"" in the ethereum classic Discord channel. ""We have agreed on testnet and can still decide on mainnet.""  The Atlantis upgrade introduces changes to the ethereum classic network that were formally introduced on the original ethereum network back in 2017. The goal is to enhance interoperability between the two blockchains such that migration of decentralized applications (dapps) from one blockchain to the other is easier.  Now, with a moderately sped-up timeline for testnet activation, some ecosystem participants hope to see Atlantis implemented on the main network as early as August.  Created in 2016, ethereum classic came about following a fork of the ethereum network in the wake of the now-infamous collapse of The DAO, a smart contract-based funding vehicle that failed following a debilitating code exploit. It arose amid disagreements over plans to hard fork the network to effectively undo the damage caused by The DAO's failure, with ETC continuing on with the original chain.  Still, as early as last week, developers were in disagreement last week over certain components of Atlantis.  Namely, concerns had been raised over the efficacy of making a fixed cap to the size of smart contract code on the blockchain a backwards-incompatible change – warranting a hard fork – as opposed to a backwards-compatible change which would not require a mandatory upgrade.  No resolution to this disagreement has been made yet. However, developers did agree during Friday's meeting that another call would be coordinated for June 13 to further discuss the contents and schedule for the upgrade.  As soc1c told CoinDesk:  ""I can't tell what the future will bring. For now we agreed to fork the testnets with everything included in [Atlantis] as it is, and reserve the option to modify mainnet spec and date in a subsequent call.""

42402996,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde2Ft,1559917821,May Was Best Month for CME Bitcoin Futures Volume Since 2017,"May was the best month for derivatives giant CME's bitcoin futures volume since its 2017 launch, as nearly 300,000 contracts were traded in the 31-day period.  Average daily volume (ADV) reached more than 13,600 contracts, equal to $515 million notional value or 68,000 equivalent bitcoin, up 27 percent when compared to the month of April. On May 13, bitcoin futures traded a record single-day volume of 33,677 contracts (168,000 equivalent bitcoin or $1.3 billion notional value) while on May 28, BTC hit a record open interest of 5,190 contracts.  It may be a sign that institutional interest is on the rise, with 223 trading accounts added in May, the most since January 2018 according to research conducted by CME Group.  Volume month to month  As can be seen on the chart above May marked a 27 percent increase in volume on the month prior and a 73.69 percent increase on March, 2019's volumes, hinting at gradual increasing interest in bitcoin futures.  Open interest month to month  Volume and open interest, however, are two distinctly different things.  While volume is the number of contracts traded in a day, after each session, the figure starts over at zero. Open interest, on the other hand, is the number of contracts that have been created and that are open.  As can be seen above, futures were first listed on the CME at the height of the bull market in December 2017.

Speaking to German business magazine WirtschaftsWoche earlier this week, Laura McCracken, Facebook's head of financial services and payment partnerships for Northern Europe, confirmed that the planned stablecoin will not be tied to any single fiat currency, but will instead be linked to a basket of currencies in order to prevent volatility.  The executive also added to recent reports that GlobalCoin would be revealed later this month, saying that a white paper for the token would be published on June 18.  McCracken was talking to the magazine at a trade conference in Amsterdam.  The confirmation comes after reports listing some of the executives said to be working on the effort. These include MIT’s Christian Catalini as chief economist and Sunita Parasuraman, manager of the Switzerland-based foundation leading the token project.  Facebook may further set up physical portals for users to purchase the cryptocurrency, as well as charging third parties as much as $10 million for the privilege of supporting the network as nodes, according to The Information.  Elsewhere, Russian news site RBC reported Thursday that head of oil firm Rosneft, Igor Sechin, told the St. Petersburg Economic Forum that Facebook's cryptocurrency could possibly be used in oil transactions ""in the near future."" Sechin, however, seemed to be talking generally about how big U.S. tech firms like Google, Apple and Facebook are making moves into the energy industry.  He added the skeptical note:  “At the same time, someone might get the illusion that technology giants will make the energy market fundamentally more transparent and efficient, becoming a panacea for solving the acute problems of modern times.""

Through its ZX Ventures arm, the brewing giant – which also owns the Stella Artois, Corona and Beck's brands, among many others – has invested an undisclosed amount in a Series A fundraising for blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) startup BanQu, according to an announcement.  Established in 2015, BanQu connects workers, such as farmers who are often unbanked, directly with companies and organizations further along the supply chains they serve using its blockchain platform.  Via BanQu, such individuals are said to able to access financial service provides such as MTN and Airtel via partner banks and mobile money providers, ultimately boosting their financial prospects. The startup says it has so far helped over 200,000 individuals and aims to raise 100 million people out of poverty by 2023.  AB InBev and BanQu previously partnered on a pilot connecting 2,000 Zambian farmers to the mobile platform. The project was later extended to other countries, including Uganda, India, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, and more.  Tony Milikin, chief sustainability and procurement officer at AB InBev, commented:  “After BanQu’s outstanding pilot performance in our 100+ Accelerator, we are pleased to solidify the partnership with Ashish, Jeff and the entire team at BanQu through an equity investment. Together, we are working to improve access to modern banking for thousands of farmers in underserved rural markets, driving inclusive growth and contributing to our own 2025 Sustainability Goal as well as the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals.”  Proceeds from the Series A round will be used by BanQu to cement its existing operations and to help expand rollouts in China and Mexico later this year, the firm said.

According to a report from The Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday, the ATO is working on 12 tax avoidance cases involving abuse of crypto assets. Notably, the agency's deputy commissioner, Will Day, said at least one of the cases involve a ""global financial institution,"" which is suspected of hiding assets and income details of taxpayers.  The ATO's crackdown is part of a global investigation by tax authorities from five countries, including Australia, the U.S., the U.K., the Netherlands and Canada. These agencies, known as the ""J5,"" are pursuing a further 50 similar investigations globally.  The agencies came together last year to form a collective response against growing tax avoidance, cybercrime, and cryptocurrency abuse, according to the report, and have been sharing international data to pursue tax evaders.  Day cited evidence as showing that individuals in Australia have been enabling tax avoidance or teaming up with people in other countries to conduct criminal activities.  ""At no other time have criminals been at greater risk of being caught. In Australia, they are often intermediaries who are playing a role between the tax evader and an offshore entity,"" he said.  Last month, authorities in the Netherlands shut down a cryptocurrency ""mixer,"" which was used to obfuscate the source of cryptocurrency transactions.  Europol, which was involved in the action, alleged that much of the money that passed through Bestmixer.io “had a criminal origin or destination,” contending that “in these cases, the mixer was probably used to conceal and launder criminal flows of money.”  According to The Herald, information from Bestmixer is being examine and shared between J5 members  Australian tax form image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Benedict Alibasa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/07/australia-to-crack-down-on-crypto-tax-avoidance-schemes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7f36ad05d92b71fb4c24cf33d13b737b591f9faa-1000x635.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402998,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde2Gs,1559901636,Bitcoin Price Eyes Stronger Recovery Rally After Bounce to $8K,"View  Bitcoin has bounced back to $8,000, forming a double bottom breakout – a bullish price pattern – on the 4-hour chart.  The price breakout has opened the doors to $8,400. On the way higher, BTC may face resistance at $8,350.  A rally to $8,350, if any, could be short-lived if trading volumes remain low.  A break below $7,432 (June 4 low) would revive the case for a drop to the 50-day moving average at $6,915.  Bitcoin has recovered to $8,000 after defending key support for two consecutive days and may remain well bid over the weekend.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading at $7,990 on Bitstamp, having hit a high of $8,020 earlier today.  BTC ran into offers around $7,900 in the early U.S. trading hours on Thursday and fell back to $7,450. However, much like Wednesday, the drop below the 4-hour chart's 200-candle moving average (then located at $7,588) was short lived.  With the rise back to $8,000, the cryptocurrency has charted a bullish technical pattern on one of the short-duration charts. As a result, the recovery rally may continue, with prices rising to $8,400 over the weekend.  The weekly close (Sunday, as per UTC) will also be key. BTC witnessed solid two-way business last week before ending on a flat note, a sign of indecision among buyers. A short-term bearish reversal would be confirmed if prices close below last week's low of $8,000 on Sunday.  4-hour chart  Bitcoin's previous 4-hour candle closed out just above the resistance of $7,924, confirming a double-bottom breakout.  The pattern essentially represents a bearish-to-bullish trend change. So, it seems safe to say the pullback from the May 30 high of $9,097 has ended and the path of least resistance is now to the higher side.  It's worth noting that a double-bottom breakout is usually followed by a move higher by roughly the length of the spread between the bottom and the neckline – in this case from $7,450 to $7,924, giving potential a rise of around $470.  So, with breakout already confirmed, BTC could climb toward $8,400 over the weekend. On the way higher, BTC may face resistance at $8,350 – the upper edge of the falling channel representing bearish lower highs and lower lows.  The rally, however, could be short lived if trading volumes remain anemic. As the above chart shows, trading volumes are locked in a downtrend despite the price recovery.  Daily chart  BTC created a long-tailed doji candle on Thursday amid falling volume bars – another sign the pullback may be over.  That said, the outlook would turn bullish only if prices see a high-volume UTC close above the 4-hour chart falling channel resistance, currently at $8,350. A channel breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to $9,000.  On the downside, the June 4 low of $7,432 is the level to beat for the bears. A violation there would put the focus back on the bearish divergence of the RSI and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day MAs and allow for a deeper drop to the 50-day MA at $6,915.  The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices hold above the May low of $5,263.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

A blog post from the npm JavaScript package repository, first reported by ZDNet, indicated that its security system raised an alert about a backdoor on June 5 that could have been used by hackers to rob users of one of Komodo's older wallets, Agama.  An audit showed a malware threat with the potential to steal cryptocurrency wallet seeds and logins.

Npm said:  ""After being notified by our internal security tooling of this threat we responded by notifying and coordinating with Komodo to protect their users as well as remove the malware from npm.""  In a security alert, Komodo said: ""After discovering the vulnerability, our Cyber Security Team used the same exploit to gain control of a lot of affected seeds and secure the funds at risk.""  Komodo said it was able to safeguard 8 million komodo (KMD) tokens and 96 bitcoin, collectively worth nearly $13 million.

42402987,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde263,1559894459,NEO Releases Detailed Financials Ahead of Cryptocurrency Relaunch,"The technology behind the cryptocurrency NEO, formerly known as Antshares, will be completely reconfigured by this time next year.  In April, NEO co-founder Erik Zhang announced that an optimized version of the blockchain network will relaunch as NEO 3.0 in 2020. The underlying infrastructure will be so different that token holders will need to turn in their assets for newly issued tokens.  Zhang told CoinDesk this process will not require know-your-customer (KYC) information, as the Singapore-based NEO Foundation will simply destroy the old assets and airdrop new tokens to designated wallets.  “Users only need to keep their private key. New tokens will be automatically dropped to their wallet address,” Zhang said, adding community leaders will work with exchanges to swap any tokens stored there. “We need to make sure that old tokens and new tokens don’t flow at the same time.”  These tokens have been circulating for years, so it is hard to say how a centralized point of redistribution will impact the ecosystem.  A financial report from the NEO Foundation, revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, showed the initial coin offering in 2016 raised $97,517 plus 8,169 bitcoin, the latter of which was mostly liquidated for more than $8.3 million by February 2018.  Meanwhile, around 100,000 “unclaimed” NEO tokens that, according to the foundation, people bought during crowdfunding sales but never added to their wallets, will revert to the foundation in October 2019, the financial report said, if the participating wallets aren’t registered for the swap. NEO is currently trading around $11, according to CoinMarketCap.  While this may sound antithetical to the cypherpunk ethos, the open source NEO project has always been more akin to a commercial enterprise, albeit with an opaque structure, than most grassroots cryptocurrencies. It’s sometimes referred to as a Chinese, regulator-friendly version of ethereum.  Along those lines, venture capitalist Dovey Wan, previously of the DHVC fund that invested in the NEO founders’ sister company Onchain, described NEO as a “compliant” blockchain project where the founders’ companies have “close relationships” with Chinese authorities and run most of the masternodes themselves.  A spokesperson for the nonprofit confirmed the NEO Foundation itself runs five of the seven consensus nodes, telling CoinDesk:  “Since there is a migration required for NEO 3.0, the decentralization plan is currently on hold in order to implement the migration plan more efficiently.”  While some critics say the value of NEO tokens plummeted in 2018 while both founders – Zhang and Da Hongfei – focused on Onchain, NEO Foundation manager Grace Gui said the close relationship between Onchain and NEO will build a larger ecosystem with interoperability.  ""Onchain and NEO have a different target, operation model, management team and decision-making mechanism,"" Gui said. ""NEO is an open source platform for the smart economy and we are using a community development model.""  Speaking to how Onchain relates to the NEO ecosystem, Hongfei told CoinDesk:  “They share the same smart contracts. So if you know how to do smart contracts on NEO, it will be very easy to do smart contracts on OnChain.”  Nonprofit conglomerate  Many of the companies associated with NEO have proven to be a lucrative boon for both co-founders.  Zhang and Hongfei used funds from the ICO to create independent entities housed under the foundation, including Neo Global Capital (NGC) and the NEO Eco Fund (which is managed by NEO Global Development (NGD)). These funds invested in external startups like Chromaway, Ontology, StarkWare and Oasis Labs, the financial report said.  With regards to such investments and how bitcoin returns are deployed, Hongfei said there’s no formal voting mechanism for community input.  “Usually it’s me and Erik making the decisions,” he said.  This structure is controversial. Ethan Fast, a member of the City of Zion team that operates one of the two external NEO consensus nodes, told CoinDesk in 2018 the ecosystem runs as a “benevolent oligarchy.”  Stepping back, half of the original NEO tokens were sold in the ICO to fund the foundation’s operations, including the fiat salaries of 50 employees at a Shanghai office. Hongfei said most employees work for NGD, the company that manages the NEO Eco Fund, not the community-oriented parent foundation. The Onchain offices, a software-as-service (SaaS) startup focused on enterprise clients with no formal relation to the nonprofit, are also located in the same building as the NEO Foundation.  Hongfei is currently CEO of Onchain while Zhang is CTO, in addition to leadership roles they both hold at various NEO-affiliated entities. Their SaaS startup is now seeking a new funding round from venture capitalists while the NEO ecosystem undergoes this token redistribution plan.  ICO breakdown  Out of the remaining ICO tokens, 30 percent were divided among the nonprofit’s investment arms and a “contingency fund,” according to the NEO report. The final 20 percent of ICO tokens were allocated to “motivate” developers, Hongfei said.  According to the nonprofit’s statements, there are at least 10 organized developer groups contributing to the NEO blockchain, only two of which are officially based in China.  “Most of the core developers are living outside of China,” Hongfei said. “Those core developers, many of them work full-time, but they are not employed by us. They are not employed by anyone. But we send them NEO tokens to compensate them.”  In 2019, the foundation’s leadership is focused on growing that developer base as the community gears up for the 3.0 launch.  To help achieve this goal, some of the original ICO funds were used to open an office in Seattle in February 2019, headed by Microsoft alum John deVadoss. He told CoinDesk the NEO Foundation plans to have up to 18 employees at this office by 2020 and leverage a “very strong partnership” with Microsoft to build out developer tooling.  Speaking to the unilateral system update on the horizon, Zhang concluded:  “The main goal of developing NEO 3.0 is to enable NEO to support large-scale commercial applications.”  NEO booth at Consensus 2019 image via CoinDesk archives",NEUTRAL,NEO,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | NEO | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/06/07/neo-releases-detailed-financials-ahead-of-cryptocurrency-relaunch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63b486430cc048852653327402cd7a6bcab5570c-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402994,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde2Dv,1559880038,What to Expect When the IRS Alters Its Bitcoin Tax Policy,"The Takeaway  Coming guidance from the IRS will address longstanding questions about the tax treatment of cryptocurrency.  The tax collector has identified several specific issues it will discuss, including whether investors owe taxes on free crypto they get from a fork.  The industry is also hoping for clarity on a number of other matters, including the tax implications of airdrops, staking and crypto stored at overseas exchanges.      Every tax season, cryptocurrency investors in the U.S. struggle to figure out how much they owe the government. But next April it might be a little bit easier.  Last month, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said it would ""soon"" issue new guidance on the tax treatment of crypto, something it hasn't done since an initial notice the agency issued in 2014.  In its original guidance, the IRS stated that for tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property and not as currency. But it left a number of key questions unanswered, such as how to value cryptocurrency received as income.  The market has become more complicated in the intervening years, with the emergence of phenomena like airdrops and forks that essentially give people free crypto, raising new questions about tax liability.  In a letter last month to Rep. Tom Emmer, IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig said the forthcoming guidance would address these issues and others. He did not say exactly when it will come out, and neither would the IRS when contacted by CoinDesk.  It's hard to predict when the IRS will publish the new guidance, but as the extended due date for individual returns is October 15, and for pass-through businesses it is September 15, ""they may shoot to have guidance out before those extended deadlines,"" said Kirk Phillips, a certified public accountant (CPA).  Below, we explain the major areas where the crypto community is looking for more clarity from the taxman.  How much did you make?  One of the most important questions since the publication of the IRS' first notice has been how taxpayers should determine the fair market value of cryptocurrency they receive as income (in exchange for goods and services, for instance). This is its cost basis.  The 2014 guidance says that if a cryptocurrency is listed on an exchange, the fair market value is determined by converting it into U.S. dollars ""at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.""  However, unlike securities or property, cryptocurrencies can vary in price widely between different exchanges, said Phillips, the author of ""The Ultimate Bitcoin Business Guide.""  “Every exchange can have its own pricing methodology, and if you’re using ten different exchanges there will be ten different pricing models,” he said.  The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) has suggested that taxpayers should be allowed to use the average rate of the day and the average price of different exchanges to calculate the value of their crypto, as well as aggregating indexes like CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  Any of these methods can work as long as taxpayers are consistent in applying them, AICPA said in comments submitted last year to the IRS. Also, it should be possible to use a combination of methods for various instances.  ""Taxpayers may have one method applied to one wallet and another method applied to another exchange when determining the fair value of all the bitcoin transactions,"" the comment says.  James T. Foust, a senior research fellow at the industry advocacy group CoinCenter, suggested a similar approach in a recent report.  Users should be allowed to use ""either the exchange rate data from one exchange, averaged exchange rate data from a fixed set of exchanges, or a third-party exchange rate index"" for each cryptocurrency, as long as they use these methods consistently, Foust wrote.  Which coins did you spend?  An even trickier task is determining the cost of each unit of cryptocurrency that was spent in a taxable transaction, such as a sale.  Lisa Zarlenga, a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, explained that when you sell cryptocurrency you should specifically identify the fraction you’re selling to calculate a gain or loss.  For other asset classes, there are established ways to do this. For example, in stock trading, taxpayers can apply the average cost basis or the ""first in, first out"" (FIFO) assumption: that they are selling the earliest acquired piece of stock, so the price is determined as the one registered at the time of the first purchase.  “But the simplified approach doesn’t apply to other types of property, only to stock,” Zarlenga said. “So one thing the IRS could do is extend it to cryptocurrency, which would be very helpful.”  Even that wouldn’t help in every case, noted Phillips. ""First in, first out"" can be a problem if the price of the earliest acquired coin is zero — if the owner mined it, for instance.  Imagine somebody who earlier mined some bitcoin is trying to cash out another coin which cannot be sold for fiat, and so would have to sell it for bitcoin and then sell that bitcoin for fiat. In this case, the bitcoin, bought and immediately sold, won’t bring its owner any profit, but if the cost basis is defined by the first coins this person ever acquired (which is zero), they will have to report a capital gain.  In such cases the FIFO principle might become a trap, Phillips said. “It can create a fictitious gain that doesn’t match the economic substance.”  At the moment, there are a number of software platforms for calculating taxes on crypto using different methodologies, and the best the IRS can do is to leave it for users to choose, Phillips said. As the technology and the market mature, better solutions can be found, he said.  “The best scenario would be to leave it broadly open for the taxpayer to decide what method they use as long as they apply a consistent methodology: you can’t change it around from year to year,"" he said.  Forks, airdrops, staking  In addition to buying and selling, there is a list of other events that need clarification for tax purposes, including forks, airdrops and staking.  All of these involve people receiving one cryptocurrency because they already hold another. For example, anyone who held bitcoin on August 1, 2017, can claim a like amount of bitcoin cash, which was born that day, and of the other currencies that subsequently split off from the main chain.  So what do they owe Uncle Sam from this windfall? Foust's report for Coin Center notes that when a fork happens, owners of the original cryptocurrency can make no effort to take possession of the new coins and never actually get them, and in this case, there should be no tax effect. But if they do get their portion of the splinter currency and sell it, that should be taxable at the time of the sale.  It's important to consider how much control taxpayers have over the situation when they keep their crypto with custodial exchanges, Foust noted. ""If a taxpayer holds their cryptocurrency with a custodial exchange, any actions that the exchange takes regarding airdropped or forked tokens should not affect the taxpayer unless such actions were undertaken at the direction of the taxpayer.""  The American Bar Association suggested a different approach in its comments on the 2017 fork that created bitcoin cash. The document, submitted to the IRS in March 2018, proposed that ""taxpayers who owned a coin that was subject to a Hard Fork in 2017 would be treated as having realized the forked coin resulting from the Hard Fork in a taxable event"" and the value of a new coin should be zero.  ""It means that at the time of the fork they’ll be treated as earning zero dollars in income. So the fork event itself will not result in any tax liability,"" Omri Marian, one of the authors of the comments, explained to CoinDesk. ""When they dispose of the forked coin, they’ll be taxed on the entire proceeds of the transaction.""  Forks can be treated by analogy with traditional financial and business events, Zarlenga said, and it depends which analogy the IRS will see as more appropriate: possible options include events that currently don’t have tax consequences, like a stock split or a cow giving birth to a calf, but also taxable events like getting free samples and using them, finding property or earning dividends on a property.  Another relatively new concept, staking, or using one's coins to participate in transaction validation on proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, is a hot topic in the crypto world. As institutional players have taken an interest in putting their PoS holdings to work, powerhouses like Coinbase have started offering staking-as-a-service.  Staking should be treated as ordinary income, as mining already is, because these two activities bring taxpayers new coins in a similar way, AICPA's memo suggests. The expenses on staking, if there are any, should be deducted from such income as ordinary expenses, i.e. expenses that are common and accepted in a certain business.  Other issues  Three of the issues discussed above – cost basis calculation, cost basis assignment, and forks – are explicitly mentioned in Rettig's letter to Emmer, but there are several others that crypto tax experts hope the upcoming IRS guidance will address.  One with serious consequences for taxpayers is whether keeping, buying and selling cryptocurrencies on exchanges registered overseas should be reported under the rules for foreign bank accounts, Zarlenga and Phillips said.  U.S. citizens must file a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR) for any such account holding more than $10,000. Also, Americans holding foreign financial assets worth more than $50,000 have to report them under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Failure to report can result in severe penalties, Phillips noted.  Should these rules apply to crypto? AICPA believes so: the value of crypto kept in foreign jurisdictions should be aggregated with the value of fiat and other assets abroad and reported under FBAR and FATCA, the institute's comments say.  But if taxpayers keep their crypto in personal wallets and control the private keys, this crypto should be considered ""cash which resides wherever the taxpayer resides,"" and no FBAR or FATCA compliance is needed, the document suggests.  Another issue that deserves clarification is the status of small transactions when people use cryptocurrency to buy goods and services, Phillips said. As it stands, they also have to be reported as taxable events, which discourages spending crypto, and exempting transactions up to a certain threshold could eliminate this problem.  Then there are charitable donations: right now, if you're donating any property valued more than $5,000 you need to get a qualified appraisal, an expert estimation of that property's value.  Cryptocurrency should be exempted from this rule as publicly traded securities are, AICPA said. ""The rationale is that the prices for these publicly traded stocks are available on established exchanges, thus not requiring a qualified appraisal. The same is true for most, if not all, types of virtual currencies.""  While these questions may sound arcane, resolving them would remove a lot of aggravation for taxpayers. Hence, the community is waiting with bated breath to see how the IRS comes down on them.  Zarlenga concluded:  “This is going to be the first time they are speaking in five years. A lot has happened in the industry, and people are eager for some input.”  Tax report form image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | FORKS,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/07/what-to-expect-when-the-irs-alters-its-bitcoin-tax-policy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/988741c9adc6e0613b5797827279324fa6197b95-1500x1125.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42402992,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAde2Ay,1559871043,Kodak Launches a Blockchain-Enabled Document Management System,"Kodak’s pivot to blockchain is coming into focus. The legacy camera brand announced a new blockchain-based document management system, at a two-day conference in Rochester, New York.  Unlike previous Kodak-blockchain announcements, Kodak Document Management Platform is not under license to a third-party and is an actual Kodak product.  The platform, launched under the name Kodak Services for Business, is intended for businesses and governments to store and manage sensitive documents. Kodak Document Management Platform relies on blockchain to provide efficiency and security, according to the company.  The company also claimshttps://www.kodak.com/US/en/services-business/solutions/blockchain/default.htm that the blockchain platform will lead to 20-40% cost savings through automated workflows and decreased human management of content, information, and documents.  Kodak’s beginnings as an information solutions provider can be traced to a 2013 statement, which said the firm “has transformed into a technology company focused on imaging for business.” To that end, “Kodak serves customers with disruptive technologies and breakthrough solutions for the product goods packaging, graphic communications and functional printing industries.”  Taking that message and running with it in recent years, Kodak has embraced blockchain technologies or at least lent its name to companies involved in such schemes.  In January 2018, a third-party licensed the Kodak brand name for KODAKCoin, which was designed to work with a blockchain developed to track image copyrights online. Following the initial announcement, Kodak’s stock price jumped from $3.10 to a high of $13.28 the next day in heavy trading.  Between the project announcement and launch, polarized voices proclaimed the move as either a great reinvention for a 130-old firm, or just another scam. Ultimately, the currency was delayed-- a day before the planned ICO -- though the project is still under development with a scheduled July 1, 2019 launch.  “In light of the increased worldwide regulatory interest in ICOs, RYDE Holding, Inc. is taking the necessary measures to ensure that our offerings comply with all applicable securities and other laws,” the parent firm said.  Though the coin is not yet trading, RYDE Holdings in conjunction with ICOx Innovations has built the database of image rights under Eastman Kodak’s name. KODAKOne has reportedly generated more than $1 million in licensing claims -- while in beta -- by photographers who had monetized their work.  “Kodak is synonymous with trust and quality,” said Alejandro Castano from IKNO Colombia, in a statement.  Eastman Kodak’s current stock price is $2.30. Despite Kodak’s baptism by fire into the world of digital assets, smart contracts, and blockchain the company’s stock is up on announcement.
