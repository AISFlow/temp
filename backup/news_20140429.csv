42377201,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziM9,1398809717,Blockchain Seeks Community Assistance for Product Testing,"Blockchain  , the bitcoin company best known for its popular consumer wallet and block chain explorer, is on the hunt for a group of beta testers to help it develop new tools and features.  The Blockchain Beta Group will include developers and customers of the site, according to an official blog post. The notice also reached out to members of the community who may want to participate.  The need for the a beta group rose out of Blockchain’s fast-paced development, CEO Nic Cary told CoinDesk.  Cary said:  ""Blockchain has a very aggressive release schedule and we've decided to solicit the bitcoin community to help give us early feedback. We're not trying to do things the old-fashioned way here.""  Blockchain believes beta testers will help improve the overall user experience it offers, while providing those involved with a first look at Blockchain products.  Tapping the power of the community  Blockchain listed a series of questions for those seeking entry into its pool of beta testers, asking applicants how often they use bitcoin, whether they had taken part in previous beta pools and what they do with their BTC.  The only requirements for the beta pool are that interested parties fill out the questionnaire and, if contacted by the company for participation, sign a non-disclosure agreement.  Cary added that Blockchain is seeking a varied group of participants from across the bitcoin community.  Cary said:  ""Bitcoin users come from a hugely diverse and distributed background - it's our hope to tap into their enthusiasm and experiences to improve and refine Blockchain apps.""  A busy year for Blockchain  2014 has been an active year for the company.  Earlier this month, Blockchain announced that it had signed a five-year deal to manage ‘Bitcoin.com’, as part of a move aimed at expanding the company’s public outreach efforts.  Blockchain has also partnered with the Bitcoin Foundation on the first-ever Blockchain Awards, though not all its news has been positive. For instance, itsuffered a severe outage in mid-March caused by a database glitch.

42377197,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziJd,1398805224,"FinCEN: Digital Currency Cloud Mining, Escrow Services Aren't Money Transmitters","The US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has issued new rulings indicating that digital currency-related cloud mining and escrow services should not be considered money transmitters.  The two releases came via what appear to be responses to requests from businesses seeking to better understand FinCEN's policies.  FinCEN, the bureau of the US treasury that collects and analyzes financial transactions, has previously released influential decisions regarding how consumer bitcoin miners and bitcoin investors should be regulated under money transmission laws.  Published letter rulings often express an opinion about a new issue, according to the agency's website.  Escrow  Escrow in digital currency transactions is used to ensure parties are able to pay each other while remaining relatively unknown.  Read one letter that FinCEN released today:  ""The [escrow company] needs to take possession of the funds and hold them in escrow until the pre-established conditions for the funds to be paid to the seller or returned to the buyer are met, then release those funds appropriately.""  The letter also presented background information on more traditional escrow-related businesses that FinCEN has ruled should not be treated as money transmitters.  This included instances of escrow companies that have, ""accepted any consumer and any merchant willing to use its confidential process, and played no active part in arranging, monitoring, verifying or endorsing the transactions that it processed"".  FinCEN reasoned in the letter that this process, while part of a transactional as a whole, is not in itself a money transmission-type of service:  ""The acceptance and transmission of funds do not constitute a separate and discrete service provided in addition to the underlying service of transaction management.""  Cloud mining  Cloud mining is when a customer 'rents' digital currency mining hardware from a provider. Customers then pay the provider on a monthly or yearly contract and profit from a subsequent portion of a confirmed blocks.  The second FinCEN letter  states that this type of business does not fall under the auspices of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations:  ""Renting of mining computer systems to third parties does not make the Company a money transmitter under BSA regulations.""  The letter notes that FinCEN's view is that as property, digital currency that is mined under this system does not change hands:  ""All virtual currency mined by the third party remains the third party’s property, and the Company has no access to the third party wallet, nor receives or pays virtual currency on the third party’s behalf.""  It seems that the computer systems component is central to this decision. ""The rental of computer systems to third parties is not an activity covered by FinCEN regulations,"" the letter adds.

The presiding judge has set 22nd September as the date the trial will commence, according to Bloomberg. Shrem’s plea was submitted on his behalf by his lawyer.  Shrem, 24, was indicted earlier this month by federal prosecutors, who allege that he had facilitated bitcoin payments processing on the now-defunct Silk Road online black marketplace beginning in 2011.  The case had previously been postponed in early April after prosecutors asked for more time to craft a plea deal.  At the time, the case was delayed until 28th April. Shrem was officially indicted on 10th April.

42377195,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziEb,1398799826,Cyprus Primary School Now Accepts Bitcoin for Student Fees,"The Lighthouse Progressive Primary School, located in Limassol, Cyprus, is now accepting bitcoin payments for student fees.  Lighthouse  offers a holistic educational experience, aimed at children between the ages of five and 12 years old. According to its Facebook profile, the school is ""a progressive, bilingual, primary school created by a multidisciplinary team of professionals"".  The news that the school would take bitcoin as a form of fee payment was originally announced on reddit by parent Marios Neocleous, who lobbied the school to begin taking bitcoin for his son’s fees.  Speaking with CoinDesk, Lighthouse headmaster and co-founder Costa Constantinides framed the decision to accept bitcoin as part of a broader focus on civil self-determination, saying:  ""Empowerment means choice and responsibility. It creates freedom and peace. The creation of money supply is a fundamental political decision with huge ramifications of which we, here in Cyprus, have become all too well aware.""  ""Thus allowing individuals to impact or co-create the currency with which they use for commerce in their daily lives is an basic step in civil empowerment,"" he continued.  Role in education  Lighthouse is not the first educational organization to accept bitcoin. In November 2013, the University of Nicosia announced that it would take bitcoin for tuition payments.  The university told CoinDesk that the decision was based on the technological evolution sparked by bitcoin that is currently taking place.  For Lighthouse, the choice centered on allowing families in the community more financial freedoms. Headmaster Constantinides pointed to recent financial turbulence in Cyprus as a sign that new forms of exchanging value have a place in the community:  ""Alternative currencies offer more freedom and implicitly more dignity for all. And until proven otherwise have, for us at least, have the same if not more value as any fiat currency.""  Cyprus troubles  The decision by Lighthouse to accept bitcoin payments is a positive one for Cyprus.  In addition to the choice by the University of Nicosia, which supported domestic bitcoin usage, the country’s central bank decided in February that bitcoin is legal in Cyprus, despite other comments to the contrary.  However, the digital currency’s history in Cyprus has not been without its fair share of controversy.  In early April, the bitcoin services company Neo & Bee seemed to disappear amid allegations of fraud against its CEO, Danny Brewster, whose arrest is currently being sought by law enforcement officials.

42377202,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6ziKt,1398796819,New Bitcoin Foundation Chapter is Sign of Bitcoin's Bright Future in Mexico,"The Bitcoin Foundation added its latest affiliate chapter this week when it announced that Mexico's Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto had officially gained accreditation.  The decision comes at a time when the Bitcoin Foundation is looking to further its International Affiliate Program, and notably follows the appointment of the first two affiliate chapters - Bitcoin Foundation Canada and the Bitcoin Association of Australia - in December 2013.  While a boon for the Bitcoin Foundation, the move can also be seen as a validation of the work being done to grow Mexico's bitcoin ecosystem, which local sources say has succeeded in creating a greater awareness of bitcoin and its benefits among consumers, media outlets and regulators.  Founded by employees of mobile money services provider Pademobile, Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto grew out of efforts of Pademobile founder and CEO, and Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto president, Raul Nogales to learn more about the benefits of the technology.  Lucia Cangas, who is the marketing and communications director for both organisations, explained that in conducting research about bitcoin for the Pademobile platform, she and Nogales were able to find key players in the local ecosystem for their new bitcoin-focused organisation.  Now that it has gained international recognition, Cangas told CoinDesk that the group plans to expand its efforts to fight what she called the ""negative connotation"" that has so far dogged bitcoin in Mexico's mainstream press.  Cangas said:  ""We want to start working with the government and financial institutions to get more knowledge in Mexico and stop the fear surrounding bitcoin. That starts by getting involved so people start getting real information.""  In interviews with CoinDesk, members of the Mexican bitcoin community expressed enthusiasm for the decision.  Further, they also provided a big-picture look at how consumers and state decision-makers have become more aware of the technology, and how, due to the needs of local consumers in certain key markets, Mexico could prove to be fertile ground for the technology's long-term development.  Mexico comes from behind  Though Mexico has seen a rush of new businesses and interest groups, much of these developments have happened rather recently.  Pablo Gonzalez CEO and director general at Mexico-based bitcoin exchange Bitso, described the state of the industry one year ago to CoinDesk, stating:  ""The Mexican bitcoin community was extremely small and quiet a year ago, especially when you compare it with the likes of Canada and Argentina. Mexico was behind in bitcoin adoption.""  By comparison, Tomas Alvarez, CEO of Mexico-based bitcoin remittance startup Coincove, illustrated what Mexico's local ecosystem looks like today.  A Mexican citizen and domestic bitcoin business operator, Alvarez indicated that over the last six months he has watched the ecosystem change drastically.  Alvarez said:  ""Six months ago, there was almost nothing happening in the bitcoin scene, now there are regular meetups taking place in the main cities, bitcoin services popping up on a regular basis and, most importantly, bitcoin is being mentioned in schools and offices.""  Cangas indicated that bitcoin is even starting to get positive press coverage, following a spree of bad news related to defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  In the last month, she said that stories related to the businesses that are working with bitcoin and merchants that accept bitcoin have been more widely disseminated.  Regulators take notice  This increase in awareness has also translated to a greater interest from national regulators.  Bank of Mexico, the country's central bank, notably released its initial guidance for digital currency businesses in March, when it announced that its major banks would be restricted from conducting operations in digital currency.  That has not been the bank's last word on the matter, however. Sources say it has since held meetings with local industry luminaries to further explore the topic.  Despite the initial negative tone, Alvarez says that his experience with national regulators has been positive, stating ""I find their attitude towards Bitcoin to be extremely positive and constructive"". According to Alvarez, members of the local bitcoin ecosystem have been discussing how bitcoin should be regulated domestically with the central bank.  For example, while the central bank has ruled that bitcoin is a ditigal asset, not a currency, it has encouraged local businesses to abide by anti-money laundering (AML) laws, though Alvarez says they do not legally need to do so.  Gonzalez indicated that he has noticed an uptick in interest in his own talks:  ""During our calls with the officials and regulators it has been clear that they have been closely studying the subject.""  Room for growth  Members of Mexico's bitcoin ecosystem also spoke about what they see as the key areas for the expansion of the North American country's market in the next three to five years.  Gonzalez was optimistic that consumer wallet adoption will 'explode', and he expects this to happen within the next six to eight months.  This in turn, he says, will fuel the growth of supporting infrastructure.  ""Shortly afterwards, we will see mass-market remittance efforts using Bitcoin and Ripple in existent physical locations. Mobile payments and affordable cold storage will then come into the play to aid the unbanked. These are the most obvious ones.""  Gonzalez went on to say he hopes to see improvements in security, accessibility and non-currency blockchain applications in the near future as well.  Perhaps, unsurprisingly, Alvarez sees the biggest growth coming from a sector in which he's currently operating: remittances, though Congas also agrees. World Bank data suggests Mexico's global migrant workers sent home $22bn in 2013.  Of course, pursuant to the goals of Fundación Satoshi Nakamoto, Congas sees bitcoin as part of a broader effort to increase overall financial inclusion in Mexico:  ""Bitcoin can help people [to] start using more financial services, interact more with financial products [and provide] another way to get people to start using those services.""

42377172,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfb3,1398793507,New Mobile Payment System 'Paym' Poses Challenge for Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is revolutionary, both politically and technologically. For some it has also been hugely profitable. But for your average consumer, there is really only one important question: “Why is it better than what I’ve already got?”  A new payment system in the UK, which allows people to send money to each other using only mobile numbers, has just made answering that question even harder.  The system, Paym, is supported by nine of the UK’s biggest banks and is available to over 30 million people. It allows people to send money to each other digitally without having to remember bank account details; all that is needed is a mobile number.  To use Paym, you register your number with your bank and choose the account you want money to be deposited in when it is sent to your mobile number. From then on, friends will be able to send money to you easily via their banking app.  The system is very similar to Barclay’s Pingit app, but unlike Pingit, it isn’t restricted to a single bank. Bank of Scotland, Halifax, HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds, Santander and TSB are among the nine banks signed up.  RBS, NatWest and other banks will join the scheme later this year. Currently there is a £250 limit – but some banks may allow higher limits.  Convenient choice  In short, Paym is easy to use, it’s convenient and it’s useful. It is also presents a big challenge to advocates of bitcoin.  A currency that isn’t controlled by the state undermines government authority; a decentralized method of transferring ownership of digital assets is a great technological opportunity; but the more the banking sector does to make payments convenient for customers, the case for bitcoin as a rival weakens.  The reality for your average consumer – in the UK, at least – is that PayPal is a really convenient way of spending money online, touchless payments with modern debit cards are actually a very fast way of making purchases and, now, sending money to your friend is as straightforward as looking up their phone number.  “Paying someone back just got easier for millions of people,” said Adrian Kamellard, Chief Executive of the Payments Council.  If bitcoin is to prosper, bitcoin businesses will have to show they can make it far easier still.

42377188,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfwR,1398788010,Meet the 15 Candidates for the Bitcoin Foundation Board Elections,"Following the resignations of former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem and Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles from the board of directors at the Bitcoin Foundation earlier this year, 15 candidates have emerged as potential replacements as part of the organisation's ongoing special election.  Voting for the two vacant seats is now open to registered Industry Members, with the election scheduled to close at 11.59pm US EST on Wednesday, 30th April.  While the winning candidates have yet to be decided, what is certain is that these individuals will be tasked with joining the Bitcoin Foundation at a time when its image in the larger community has been hampered by storm of bad publicity, as both Shrem and Karpeles resigned amid still-ongoing troubles with law enforcement.  The eventual winners will not only be tasked with repairing the organisation's leadership standing, but also with moving the foundation forward as it looks to expand abroad and better communicate bitcoin's message to mainstream audiences.  The following are the 15 candidates in the running to take on this responsibility.      Andres Bzurovski, Astropay founder  Bzurovski is the founder of bitcoin payment processor AstroPay, which notably teamed up with Mt. Gox in late 2013 to speed up money transfers in Latin America.  While this partnership is no more, of course, Bzurovski still plans to bring an international focus to his candidacy.  Bzurovski stated in response to a foundation member question: “One of the purposes of my candidacy is to represent the interests of non-American companies and individuals. The cases which you mention do not apply to the 6.7 billion people that live outside the US, including myself.""      Bobby Lee, BTC China CEO and co-founder  Founded in April 2013, BTC China quickly became one of the most prominent bitcoin exchanges in Asia following its launch, although it has since seen increased competition from rivals such as OKCoin and Huobi.  Lee has been among the more outspoken members of China's bitcoin community in the Western media.  He frequently appears in major news sources to talk about the continued uncertainty regarding the legal status of bitcoin exchanges and other such services in China.  To date, he has been profiled by Businessweek, AllThingsD and Wired, among others.  Lee has stated that he feels the Bitcoin Foundation should take a leadership role on two initiatives – the development of bitcoin technology and government regulation.  Notably, BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi, a former candidate who has withdrawn from the race, has since endorsed Bobby Lee for the position.      Brock Pierce, venture capitalist  One of the more active VC investors in the bitcoin space, Pierce most recently helped to spearhead a campaign to save the now-defunct Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  Pierce has also been active at starting bitcoin businesses, having helped found GoCoin, ExpressCoin, KnCMiner and Robocoin Asia (to name a few).  Pierce's candidacy has been endorsed by multi-signature wallet provider BitGo.      Clint Ditto, Crypto Pros founder  A serial entrepreneur, Ditto is perhaps best known to the bitcoin community for founding the news and information resource Crypto Pros.  If elected, Ditto says he will take aim at the public misunderstandings about bitcoin and its purpose through effective communication.  Ditto has also advocated for the creation of a bitcoin-focused 'Better Business Bureau' that rates digital currency companies.      Frank Schuil, Safello CEO  The co-founder of Sweden-based bitcoin exchange Safello, Schuil is running on a platform that aims to increase transparency and education in the bitcoin ecosystem.  Schuil stated on his Bitcoin Foundation candidacy thread: ""Having dealt with educating consumers about emerging technologies in my professional career, I see an alignment to serve as Board Member of the Bitcoin Foundation while serving my company's goals.""  In addition, he says that his experience in the European market will be valuable to the foundation as it seeks to grow its influence abroad.      Henryk Dabrowski, Alternet Systems CEO  An entrepreneur with more than 25 years of experience leading information technology and telecom ventures, Dabrowski is the CEO of mobile commerce and payment transactions provider Alternet Systems.  Alternet recently supported the Digital Asset Transfer Authority (DATA) annual meeting this April, working to secure donation items and amenities for the event.  Fluent in English, Spanish, Italian and French, Dabrowski also holds additional Board of Directors posts, but did not specify a platform for his candidacy via the Bitcoin Foundation forums.      Jason M Tyra, CPA, PLLC principal  A certified public accountant from Texas, Tyra operates what he has calledhttps://www.tyracpa.com/bitcoinfoundation.php ""the only licensed accounting firm that has made bitcoin a substantial part of its business"".  Tyra commented on his candidacy:  ""Bitcoin needs an advocate to outside stakeholders that will promote adoption on a widespread basis by lobbying for favorable regulatory and tax treatment worldwide.""  Furthermore, Tyra has stated that his election would represent a necessary addition to the board, as it currently has entrepreneurs, developers and technical experts, but no tax professionals.      Jay Yeom, Bitcash vice president  Jay Yeom  is Vice President and team lead for Bitcash, a mobile application project that is scheduled to release its mobile wallet later this year. He has also served as President and CEO for several online game development and publishing companies, including Microgaming Technology Corp., Playon Interactive Inc. and Liveplex Co., Ltd.  In his official Bitcoin Foundation thread, Yeom said that he would bring a non-Western viewpoint to the Foundation board. Furthermore, he believes his years working in Asian markets and knowledge of the ecosystem in that region are major strengths to his candidacy.  Yeom said that, if elected, he will focus on the development of simple tools that enable greater adoption among consumers. He remarked that a lack easy-to-use software is a barrier for bitcoin integration worldwide.      John McDonnell, BitNet CEO and co-founder  The CEO of bitcoin processing platform BitNet, McDonnell was formerly a key executive at a number of notable payments companies including Visa, Paymo (later acquired by Boku) and PaylinX (later acquired by CyberSource).  McDonnell has called for what he calls the addition of ""vigilant gardeners"" to the bitcoin network who can help it overcome its current issues with the traditional banking system, Apple and others.  McDonnell also stated that he is interested in bitcoin's development in micropayments, wallet innovation, remittances and the development of payment systems that offer sufficient consumer protection.      Jon Holmquist, BitcoinBlackFriday organizer  Best known for his efforts to promote bitcoin's use during one of the busiest shopping days of the year in the US, Holmquist is running on a platform that would bring this focus on social issues to the foundation.  When asked about his qualifications by foundation forum users, Holmquist touted his background in community building, and promised to work to bring more communication, transparency and community involvement to the foundation.  He added in the comments:  ""I'd be a relatively unbiased, moderate choice for the Foundation.""      Leon Li, Huobi founder and CEO  Leon Li  is founder and CEO for Huboi, a digital currency exchange based in China. Also the creator of Renrenzhe, an independent lifestyle search site, Li previously worked at Oracle, and graduated from Tsinghua University.  Li responded to a question in his official Bitcoin Foundation thread by saying that, if elected, he would direct his attention to ensuring trust and security within the system, as well as ensuring that the bitcoin protocol remains ""open, extensible and participatory"".  He also called for the standardization of bitcoin practices worldwide, including in the mining, wallet development and exchange ecosystems.      Luke Dashjr, Aynstein Ideas, LLC, developer  While not as well-known as some of the CEOs on the list, Dashjr has been a software developer on the bitcoin protocol since January 2011, according to his LinkedIn profile.  There, he says he has made regular contributions to the master bitcoin wallet codebase, and was the primary author of Eloipool, the open-source bitcoin mining pool server software. Dashjr also serves as an editor at Bitcoin Magazine.  If elected, Dashjr says he will work to promote decentralization in bitcoin, and that he will look to bring a a similar approach to the board's decision-making, consulting the community using polls before making key decisions.      Mohammad Mufti, BevByen CEO  Though Mufti doesn't operate a bitcoin business, he feels this gives him a unique opportunity to represent the bitcoin community, rather than any one industry entity.  A graduate of the University of Washington, Mufti says his interest in bitcoin began in 2010, though he has also worked as a business systems analyst and market analyst since first learning about the technology.  Mufti has pledged to treat Bitcoin Foundation members as shareholders, working to increase transparency in the organization. He has indicated that he would support the foundation disclosing all of its BTC/fiat uses publicly, and would work to make the organisation less ""US biased.""  Without a business to shift his focus, Mufti says, ""I have the time and patience for communication with members, I believe in the future of cryptocurrency and I’m generally interested in hearing out my peers.""      Vinny Lingham, Gyft co-founder and CEO  Gyft began accepting bitcoin for its mobile gift cards in May 2013, and has quickly become one of the more popular ways to spend bitcoin at major merchants that do not yet accept the digital currency for payment.  Lingham  has also been outspoken about how his company's association with bitcoin has helped it grow into a $50m business, and he notably reiterated his support during an appearance at the digital currency-focused conference CoinSummit this March.  Lingham has stated that his platform would find the Bitcoin Foundation seeking to further the development of ""trustless applications"", while bringing the technology to more businesses and consumers.  At press time, Lingham had been endorsed by high-profile community members such as BitPay's Tony Gallippi and BitGo.      Vytautas Karalevičius, Spectro Coin co-founder and CEO  Karalevičius  is the co-founder and CEO of localized bitcoin exchange service provider Spectro Coin. A graduate of Cambridge University, Karalevičius' company has been called one of the fastest-growing bitcoin companies in Europe by Lithuania-based news source Made in Vilnius.  Earlier this April, Karalevičius spoke at the Lithuania-based tech conference LOGIN 2014, where, together with Remigijus Simasius, the former Lithuanian Minister of Justice and a local journalist, he discussed bitcoin issues.  Karalevičius has stated that, if elected, he will focus the foundation's efforts on promoting self-regulation within the industry and increasing overall education on the topic.

The site allows open-source developers to earn money by completing jobs posted by 'backers' who offer 'bounties' – payments, in effect.  Payment with bitcoin has been on the cards since at least March 2013, with the idea resurfacing at the start of this year.  Bountysource founder David Rappo wrote in a blogpost:  “Many of you have been requesting bitcoin support on Bountysource for a while, so we’re thrilled to announce that it’s now live.”  Bountysource is using Coinbase to process bitcoin payments. Rappo has previously said he would consider including litcoin and dogecoin payments, which Coinbase doesn't support.  “LTC and DOGE are certainly possible, but less likely in the near future [...] If Coinbase adds support for more cryptocurrencies this would make the decision a lot easier,” said Rappo on Github in January.  The lack of funding for open-source projects was recently highlighted by the Heartbleed bug in the OpenSSL protocol used by around two-thirds of websites.  OpenSSL had just one person working full-time on the project. Since then, tech giants including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, IBM, Cisco and Amazon have pledged to donate $3m in total to open source projects over the next three years. OpenSSL now also accepts bitcoin donations.  Originally founded in 2004 as a project management platform for open-source projects, Bountysource relaunched in 2012 as a crowdfunding platform and raised $1.1 million in seed funding in 2013.    CoinDesk: Bitcoin integration has been a long time coming – what's that process been like and what's taken so long? Back in March 2013 you said ""a few weeks"".      David Rappo: All of us are huge supporters of Bitcoin and have have wanted to support it even before that blog post. We started development about a year ago and got 80% of the way but the last 20% is always the hardest. We had some interface usability concerns around supporting dual currencies; we had some internal accounting and taxation concerns; and we had other product priorities come up. In the end, we decided to put Bitcoin support on hold for a while.    CD: Why do you think there's been a demand for bitcoin from your community?    DR: It makes perfect sense. Bitcoin and open-source software are incredibly complimentary. The software and protocols powering Bitcoin are open-source. The early adopters of Bitcoin were highly technical and often software developers themselves. And, as Bitcoin continues to gain traction, the need for a more efficient development platform becomes obvious. On the administrative side of things, Bitcoin solves a lot of problems around payments to an international development community.    CD: Will you be including LTC and DOGE? (I'm thinking of this discussion from last year)    DR: We’ll be adding limited support for LTC, DOGE, and several others in the coming weeks. In all cases, users will be able to view our site in these currencies. In some cases, users will be able to get paid in these currencies. Unfortunately, we likely won’t allow users to pay using these currencies until there are more mature merchants tools (i.e. Coinbase).    CD: More generally, what are your thoughts on the recent discussion about the lack of funding for open source projects (for example, OpenSSL). Are we getting closer to rectifying that?    DR: The Heartbleed fiasco has certainly shed light on the conversation, but we have a long way to go. Marc Andreessen famously stated that “software is eating the world” and is disrupting almost every industry. This wouldn’t be possible without the vast universe of open-source software that exists today. But, it’s important to understand that, as the software world continues changing and accelerating, what is available today will not be sufficient for tomorrow. When you combine this constant need for new development with disruptive ideas like cryptocurrencies and crowdfunding, it’s clear that there are going to be fundamental changes with how software is built. Needless to say, these concepts are at the heart of Bountysource.",POSITIVE,DOGE | LTC,BTC | DOGE | EXCHANGE | LTC | TECHNOLOGY,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/29/bountysource-now-lets-you-fund-open-source-projects-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a49b0af49c8049b2e6752e46d565839651292df4-1000x684.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377180,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfnd,1398777049,BitX Targets Developing Countries With Global Expansion Plan,"Exchange and wallet service BitX is about to go global with a grand plan to serve the world's emerging economies with one recognizable brand, based on solid financial industry foundations.  BitX  will do all this while retaining a local staffing and customer service identity in each of the 12-plus countries it serves, according to Marcus Swanepoel, the co-founder and CEO of parent company Switchless.  Switchless acquired the South African bitcoin exchange in October 2013 with the intent of transforming the exchange into something much larger and more international.  Big sell  BitX's primary mission is to apply professional standards from the global technological and financial worlds to localized services, in order to build digital currency trust in new markets, said Swanepoel, adding:  ""We're bringing robust technology [and] high security, including cold storage, proper APIs and ease of use, to all corners of the earth.""  The right formula of experience and a professional approach is paramount for any company introducing, not just a new product, but a new kind of financial system to places where awareness might be low, or technology seen as less than secure.  ""We're a trusted party that's been in this business for a long time,"" said Swanepoel. ""We have a solid track record of being reliable, transparent and innovative, and above all providing our customers with a great user experience. The time has come to share this with the rest of the world.""  To succeed, BitX needs to sell, not only the concept of bitcoin and digital currency to local consumers, but also the existing financial and commercial networks with which it needs to maintain healthy relationships.  Swanepoel added:  ""We have very strong technical people but also people from a financial background; we have a well-developed compliance framework, including proper KYC and AML procedures, and we're able to leverage our good relationships with regulators, merchants and banks that operate in different emerging market countries.""  Security paramount  BitX's clean design sits atop an infrastructure designed for high-volume stability and secure, multi-signature 'deep freeze' storage.  The exchange and wallet functions are kept separate. By verifying their email address, users can utilize the basic wallet to send and receive bitcoin, while those who comply with additional verification steps have access to a full exchange account where they can also buy and sell bitcoin, and shift funds to and from the wallet easily.  Under BitX's security policy, no individual at the company has access to customer funds and there are regular proof-of-reserve audits.  Two-factor authentication is recommended for account holders and BitX's 'hot wallet' is supplied with the company's own reserves.  Developers can access the public and private APIs to interface with all relevant exchange features.  Worldwide rollout  BitX is initially establishing operations in 12 countries: Brazil, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Namibia, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, South Africa and Turkey.  South African and Namibian residents already have access to full exchange features, while the secure wallet is available to anyone around the world.  Exchanges will come online in the other 10 markets over the coming months – as soon as BitX has cleared the regulatory hurdles and hired local teams. On the latter point, BitX is currently engaging in a massive worldwide recruitment drive.  The company is also developing 'merchant modules' for local businesses to accept and process bitcoin payments.  Most of the countries mentioned above have been under-served by digital currency exchanges so far, at least the class of exchange BitX aims to be. The firm also wants customer service to be in the local language wherever possible.  Explained Swanepoel:  ""There's global liquidity versus local liquidity, and we believe, in the long run, local is going to play the most important role in this ecosystem. People need to try bitcoin services in their local currency and language, they want to deal with customer service in their region.""  Develop globally, release locally  BitX has a ""strong R&D pipeline"" that includes various new features, products and partnerships, said Swanepoel.  This should be one of the worldwide distribution platform's strengths, since there is no need to develop new features from scratch for each location, he said, adding:  ""There are economies of scale here. When we find something that works in one market, we can easily roll it out to others around the world. Technology and financial systems broadly operate the same way across markets.""  Building volume  Swanepoel added that current bitcoin trade volumes in emerging markets pale in comparison to those in the more developed Europe and US. But even some of those countries don't yet have access to fully functional online exchanges and are trading via LocalBitcoins and WhatsApp groups.  ""The reality is, you're not going to have Bitstamp-like volumes in three months. But you're building a really solid infrastructure and a brand that people trust, and a great user experience, and these volumes really are picking up.""  The team has already seen market volumes in South Africa, a 'hybrid developed-emerging market', doubling every month, and other exchange volumes in places like Brazil and Poland are respectable, relatively speaking.  ""I think one of the main issues in these markets is, other than people not knowing a lot about bitcoin, is people saying 'What do I use it for?',"" said Swanepoel. To this end, BitX's merchant tools will play a part in creating utility.  Swanepoel has become known in the bitcoin industry for his efforts to build bridges between digital currencies and the 'traditional' finance industry. He has been using his years of experience at companies like Standard Chartered and Morgan Stanley, and experience in the private equity field, to build his companies.

42377170,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfZn,1398773559,Investors and Creditors Unite in Push for Mt. Gox Revival,"A group of former Mt. Gox customers have not given up on a bold plan to revive the defunct bitcoin exchange. The claimants are already involved in two proposed class-action lawsuits against Mt. Gox and their lawyers claim to have reached a deal with US-based investors to prop up the exchange.  Details of the proposed settlement were filed with a District Court in Chicago on Monday. Under the proposed agreement the former exchange users would get a 16.5% stake in the ‘new’ Mt. Gox, while the investor group, Sunlot Holdings, would take over the company.  Notably, the documents also call for the cooperation of current company stakeholders and the New Mt. Gox in the ""prosecution of the remaining defendants"", and a commitment by New Mt. Gox to ""pursue strategies to recover the missing funds"".  The lawyers are expected to present their case before a judge on Thursday, but hurdles remain.  More approval necessary  Since Mt. Gox is incorporated in Japan and Japanese authorities are overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings, they would also have to green light the proposed deal.  Jay Edelson, counsel for the US class action, said:  ""The settlement is contingent on the Japanese Courts accepting the purchase with the agreed-upon terms.""  Further, he stated that all former exchange customers, not simply those participating in the US and Canada class actions, will be able to gain from the proposal:  ""Under the deal the 16.5% stake, for example, would be shared by all consumer creditors throughout the world. Non-consumer creditors who have claims are similarly not prejudiced.""  The hope is that the proposed deal would halt liquidation proceedings, which commenced last week. The whole process is expected to take several months and the first creditor meeting is scheduled for 23rd July, giving prosecuting legal teams ample time to put together their proposal and get the necessary support from bankruptcy trustees and authorities.  In everyone’s interest?  Sunlot Holdings has issued a statement arguing that a revival plan would help former users get back more of their assets than a simple liquidation. The company's chief executive John Betts also believes it would be a good move for the community in general, as it would send the message that bitcoiners look after their own.  Sunlot Holdings also enjoys the support of Jed McCaleb, the original founder of Mt. Gox, as well as former Mt. Gox CMO Gonzague Gay-Bouchery. McCaleb already holds a 12% stake in the company, so he has a vested interest in putting Gox back on its feet.  Members of the US class action also stand to gain from the proposed deal. Liquidation can be a very lengthy process and would also derail the proposed class action suits.  Jay Edelson, the lawyer behind one of the proposed class actions, told MarketWatch that liquidation would “have been a disaster” for the class action, arguing:  “It would have taken significant time, the assets would have been depleted, and the US consumers would have gotten pennies on the dollar.""  Not giving up  Sunlot Holdings originally floated the idea of a Mt. Gox revival back in February, following talks with the exchange's embattled CEO Mark Karpeles. The firm has already filed a comprehensive rehabilitation proposal with the Tokyo District Court, outlining its plans.  The proposed plan would give Sunlot Holdings control of Mt. Gox and cost $8m to implement. Sunlot claims it already enjoys the support of more than 70% of Mt. Gox's consumer creditors.  Consumer creditors would receive some compensation, but since Sunlot Holdings puts the exchange’s outstanding debt balance at $421m, it is clear that they can’t expect much in the way of hard cash. They would, though, stand to gain a substantial stake in the new company – with liquidation they would not.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/04/29/investors-and-creditors-unite-in-push-for-mt-gox-revival,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/736be1871fab828cee9855fac30e644aafe3f67d-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42377209,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfl7,1398769352,MIT Project to Distribute $500k in Bitcoin to Undergraduates,"A couple of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) students have managed to raise $500,000 in bitcoin for a curious cryptocurrency project.  The pair intend to distribute the money to every single MIT student this fall: each undergrad will receive $100 in the digital currency.  The project was launched by Dan Elitzer, the founder and president of the MIT Bitcoin Club, and Jeremy Rubin, a sophomore studying computer science. Their goal is simple – to create an ecosystem for digital currencies at MIT.  Cryptocurrency research in a tech savvy micro-ecosystem  It’s not just another bitcoin-related publicity stunt. Elitzer and Rubin have already prepared a range of activities and they plan to work with professors and researchers in an effort to study how MIT students will use their bitcoins once they 'opt in'.  While it sounds like a fun project, the team have serious aims to spur academic and entrepreneurial activity at the campus. With its thousands of tech-savvy students, backed by world-class teachers and researchers, MIT is a prime location to launch such a project.  Rubin and Elitzer say they want to help MIT continue its long tradition as the preeminent educational institution at the forefront of emerging technologies.  The funding is coming from MIT alumni and the bitcoin community. The team has already raised more than $500,000, which is enough to cover the cost of the project and the distribution of $100 in bitcoin to all 4,528 enrolled at the institution.  Will MIT become the biggest BTC playground yet?  The team hopes to distribute the bitcoins this fall, making the MIT campus the first place in the world with widespread access to the currency.  As far as the general public goes, bitcoin adoption remains very limited. However, the college campus could soon see an influx of students eager to spend their free bitcoins. Rubin added:  “Giving students access to cryptocurrencies is analogous to providing them with internet access at the dawn of the Internet era.”  The organizers admit they still don’t know how students will use their bitcoin, but that’s largely the point. The programme offers a unique opportunity to study behaviour, spending habits, identify potential problems and alternative uses for bitcoin – no strings attached.  Best of all, we are talking about MIT students, who know a thing or two about tech and innovation.

42377182,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6zfot,1398766553,Why Bitcoin's Volatility is Unique Among Commodities,"A single bitcoin broke the price of an ounce of gold five months ago. Now, it’s worth less than half that – and, of the two, it’s bitcoin's price that’s bouncing around the most.  For people trying to evaluate bitcoin’s potential against other commodities, its relative price volatility could be a worry or an opportunity, depending on your appetite for risk. So, how closely can we map bitcoin’s volatility against other commodities?  Not very closely, argues Kirill Gourov, Director of Finance for Blocktech, a new company that creates open-source block chains for industries in need of disruption. He recently wrote a paper that explored whether there was an intrinsic value for bitcoin.  Gourov pointed out that it is difficult to find a direct correlation between bitcoin and other commodities:  “There may be a correlation between commodities and bitcoin because people consider both to be hedges for macro risk, but whereas oil might go up 5-10% because of some legislative issue in Europe, the price of a bitcoin might spike up 25%, then immediately drop by 30% because someone cashed out into the market.”  Copper’s recent price drop looks dramatic, for example, but it represented a 9% decrease in its value. That may be considerable, but it's hardly in line with some of bitcoin’s more dramatic yo-yoing.  In five or 10 years, when the market is more developed, trends will be more prevalent and will force bitcoin to spike less, Krill suggested. But, today, the market is too easily manipulated.  Physical vs virtual  If bitcoin’s age is one factor that stops it being correlated easily with other commodities, then are there others?  One of the issues separating bitcoin from other commodities is physicality, argues Antony Lewis, who works in business development at itBit.  Most other commodities are used and transformed into something else, which drives certain behaviours, pointed out Lewis, who used to trade interbank foreign exchange at Barclays:  “For example, people buy copper to use in construction, power, and electronics. People buy oil to use to transform into fuel which is burned. Once used, gone.”  Conversely, he says, virtual currencies are bought either as a store of value or as a payment mechanism putting them in a different category to conventional commodities.  Correlations exist  Let’s not write bitcoin off as entirely separate from the commodities market, though, said George Samman, Chief Operations Officer at BTC.sx, which offers derivatives services for bitcoin traders.  There are correlations today between bitcoin and at least one other commodity, Samman said, but they’re only obvious if you turn them on their head. They are negative correlations, and we see them particularly between bitcoin and gold. When bitcoin goes up, gold falls, and vice versa, he suggested.  Samman pointed to longer-term pricing for evidence of this effect. For example, when bitcoin rose dramatically at the end of last year, gold can be seen to fall (see chart).  The linear chart shows bitcoin’s price from around the time that it spiked, shortly after the financial crisis in Cyprus last year. However, the digital currency was showing slight gains on gold as far back as 2011, said Samman.  Bitcoin’s price doesn’t seem to cross that of gold because the chart isn’t granular enough, but it did. That crossover happened for a period of hours, and we’re plotting closing prices at two-day intervals here.  Gold’s movement in relation to bitcoin might not seem that pronounced, he said, but don’t be deceived. A $10 move in bitcoin wouldn’t show clearly in a long-term chart because of its significant moves later on; furthermore, gold’s high value makes it difficult to spot smaller price moves.  Gold has been moving back up since the beginning of the year, while bitcoin has been going down, Samman added, which is clearly visible on the graph. Since then, gold has trended downwards, while bitcoin has been “semi-stable” in the mid-$400 range, he said.  Samman admitted, though, that bitcoin has ""bounced around"" in that $400-$500 window, as would be natural for a young, relatively thinly-traded asset influenced by events such as the suspension of bitcoin trading in China by certain banks, and the perceptions around those events.  Fear assets  The link between bitcoin and gold makes sense. When the market flies from bitcoin, it has to go somewhere, and the argument goes that gold gets some of that action.  If you see negative correlations in this chart, then why do they exist? It’s because Gordon Gecko was only half right. Greed isn’t the only factor driving financial markets: the other is fear.  ItBit’s Lewis calls gold a ‘fear asset’, and said that in time, it will make sense to compare bitcoin against the VIX.  Also known as the ‘fear index’, the VIX is the colloquial name for the Chicago Board Options Exchange Market Volatility Index. It is a weighted blend of 30-day options across the S&P 500 index, enabling people to use it as a broad measure of volatility over the coming month. In short, when markets get wild, the VIX goes up.  In the meantime, Samman is waiting for the time when he can more easily compare bitcoin’s activities in a broader context, outside of commodities. He likes exploring intermarket dynamics, evaluating the performance of different asset classes such as equities, bonds, and commodities, in relation to one another.  What about the longer-term opportunities for bitcoin? While we read the market's entrails looking for relatively short-term correlations now, will bitcoin and other commodities draw closer over the years?  “Some people believe we are in a commodity supercycle which began around 1990, supercycles generally last 30 years, give or take, if thats the case we are likely to see another up leg in this cycle, and I think it will be caused by inflationary events,” Samman said of long-term cycles in the commodity markets.  Built-in scarcity  In particular, the tendency towards quantitative easing – central banks creating more money – and the spectre of rising interest rates come to bear here. “This all bodes well for bitcoin to spike again as well,” he argued.  Some also point  to correlations between the price of bitcoin throughout its young life, and the longer-term price of gold, potentially supporting theories of long-term similarities.  [post-quote]  Scarcity helps drive up the price of a commodity. Food prices rise when a drought chokes off supplies, for example, and bitcoin has its scarcity built in, Samman said, adding.  “The same can be said about bitcoin and its finite amount which is capped by mining algorithms that get harder and harder.”  This scarcity is both a known and unknown quantity in bitcoin. Scarcity has a big impact on price action, which is caused by big disparities in supply and demand. Conventional commodities can be moved by external events that affect demand and supply, such as bad weather (wheat), or growing unrest in Ukraine (oil), for example.  With bitcoin, there is a base level of supply which is relatively known, because it is underpinned by the mining community, which produces them at a predefined rate of 3,600 coins per day.  However, bitcoin's algorithmically coded scarcity isn’t the only part of the equation; just as with commodity markets, other factors come into play.  With institutional miners producing bitcoins, and with large funds holding significant percentages of the digital currency, it’s hard to predict what that supply will look like in the future, and when people will begin letting more bitcoins out onto the market.  The same is true on the demand side. “Demand is the unknown here. We are hearing of many millions of dollars being lined up to buy bitcoin when the time is right,” pointed out Lewis.  Looking for liquidity  If and when the volume of bitcoin trading increases substantially, we’ll see bitcoin become more liquid. Liquidity dampens volatility, because there is more of an asset moving through the system.  This in turn makes it harder for people to move the market substantially with relatively small trades, or for events to move the market by spooking enough inexperienced investors into knee-jerk reactions.  One thing that will help here is the build-out of more established, reliable exchanges to provide a base level of reliability and choice to the market. The other is the building up of more sophisticated services on those exchanges, such as derivatives trading.  We’re starting to see markets for bitcoin derivatives emerge, such as BTC.sx. More will come, said Gourov, although the market is too immature to support complex trades yet. He explained:  “The market is neither liquid nor mature enough to handle anything like a futures contract. I would imagine the fees would be so high on a contract that you might as well just purchase the underlying bitcoins right now.”  However, he thinks that will change: “There are several companies creating products and platforms to facilitate this as I type.”  Even when its price volatility smoothes out, though, the chances are that bitcoin will remain a distinctly different animal from many other assets, making it hard to see correlations with lots of commodities.  For now, the cryptocurrency is a young, idiosyncratic asset all its own. As the honey badger of money, it tends to be a solitary animal, unaccustomed to moving with a herd.
