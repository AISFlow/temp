42398936,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgZt,1457801149,Meet the Technical Minds Behind the Hyperledger Blockchain Project,"Seeking to emulate major, successful open-source projects outside the blockchain space, the Hyperledger Project is an ambitious attempt to unite key stakeholders seeking to leverage the emerging technology.  Announced in December, the project is being led by the Linux Foundation, the trade association that oversees the development of the open-source Linux operating system. Initially called Open Ledger Project and later renamed, the effort includes the support of some 30 firms, including Cisco, Intel, JP Morgan, the London Stock Exchange and Wells Fargo.  As described on its official website, the goal is to advance blockchain technology's use in business by developing both a cross-industry open standard and an open-source development library that would allow businesses to build custom distributed ledger solutions.  Jerry Cuomo, IBM’s vice president of blockchain technologies and a participant in the initiative, told CoinDesk in February that the project aims to apply the ideas behind the blockchain to a wider variety of use cases.  He told CoinDesk at the time:  ""We set off to engineer a blockchain fabric from the ground up. It’s not about creating a consortium in some industry, we’re setting out on a mission to build a blockchain for business.""  Toward this goal, the Hyperledger Project recently established a Technical Steering Committee (TSC). Led by IBM CTO of Open Cloud Chris Ferris, the TSC is already at work seeking to make this vision a reality.  Committee goals  According to the steering committee's 10th March minutes, the group is already moving on preliminary steps to ensure future work.  An in-person meeting is scheduled to be held from 22nd to 25th March in Brooklyn, New York, which will see sessions on matters such as the project lifecycle and a proposed code of conduct for members.  Further, the group is now developing a white paper on its work following a series of informal presentations that saw developers at Intel and JPMorgan unveil blockchain-based or blockchain-inspired projects.  A separate requirements committee has begun collecting use cases for blockchain technology, with the goal of creating a repository for these assets.  But while the fruits of these efforts may be unknown, the full list of technical steering committee members offers insight as to what might be in store.  So, who is on the Hyperledger TSC?

42398919,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgM7,1457794852,Why Bitcoin's Block Size Debate is a Proxy War,"Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast and project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM.  In this opinion piece, Hagelstrom argues that the bitcoin community's emphasis on block size in the scaling debate is concealing a larger, more important argument.  Let’s start by agreeing on something: Bitcoin is a genius innovation that regulates both an economy and the technology that governs it. This technology is also decentralized, and that makes the risk of a human screw up affecting the network much less likely.  But bitcoin is far from bulletproof. Right now, bitcoin developers are engaged in a battle over a change in the code that, if implemented and accepted into the network, would increase the data capacity of transaction blocks on the blockchain. Maybe it’s not a trivial modification, but it’s still a coding discussion.  But should we assume it’s non-trivial? What if the block size debate is really just a proxy war to avoid a much more important debate that should be taking place?  Let’s do some recap before I get to that point.  Classic vs Core  On one hand, we have the Bitcoin Core developers who have been maintaining the bitcoin code since the network’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, handed over the reins and exited the project. They are the ones who, at the end of the day, decide what functionalities and fixes go into bitcoin and which ones don’t.  They also have a procedure on how the community can propose code changes to the project. Some of these proposals may be difficult to implement or maybe the Core developers don’t agree they’re best for the network.  But don’t forget this is an open-source project, so another team can come and fork (copy the code) and start working on their new version of the code.  This is what happened with Bitcoin Classic, a team of developers including former Core members Gavin Andresen and Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik who are proposing to increase the block size limit to 2 MB, allowing more transactions per block.  Bitcoin Core has done something similar, proposing a change called Segregated Witness that would boost capacity by reducing the space currently used by transaction signatures.  But, the interesting thing about Classic’s approach is that they proposed it very openly to the community and they achieved within two months, in my opinion, a significant change to bitcoin.  Core developers have been pushed to increase their communication strategy with the rest of the community – new website, new Slack channel, participation on podcasts, presence on bitcoin events were they openly explain why they think Bitcoin Classic is not a good idea.  It did not come without some cost (fights, insults, even censure), but I believe that the balance is positive and that the community should thank the Classic team for making that evolution possible.  Payments vs settlement  But going back to the original idea of this post, this debate is being used to avoid the bigger discussion about what is really happening here.  In short, we have one group (Bitcoin Classic) that thinks that bitcoin should always be a payment network, aimed at ultimately replacing traditional payment methods. Then we have another group that thinks of bitcoin as more of a settlement network (Bitcoin Core), and that end users should use sidechains, the Lightning network or other future initiatives that could appear in the future as networks for payment.  So, we have on one hand a thesis for a bitcoin blockchain that would handle more transactions with low fees following a network hard fork, and on the other, a thesis for a bitcoin blockchain that can handle fewer transactions but higher amounts (and as a consequence higher fees).  This is why I have started to call the bitcoin ""block size limit debate"" a proxy war. We should stop pretending it's about block size and take on that much more profound discussion.  Or, maybe try a different approach, a more decentralized way if you like, that doesn’t let a group of people decide about the future of bitcoin, and instead see what end users do with it.  Sure, we need to make some changes to allow the network to scale, but we don’t want to limit this great innovation at this early stage. It would be like deciding that only one use of the Internet is acceptable in 1993.  Follow Martin Hagelstrom on Twitter.

42398931,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbhgXv,1457758387,21 Inc Launches Bitcoin Micropayments Marketplace,"Bitcoin startup 21 Inc has launched the 21 Micropayments Marketplace, a new offering that enables the creation of apps that allow buyers and sellers to trade digital goods for bitcoin.  Initially, the 21.co Micropayments Marketplace will focus on allowing developers to buy and sell API calls using digital currency due to what it called existing developer pain points in the process today that inhibit a global market for such creations.  At launch, the offering is available only to users of the 21 Bitcoin Computer, the company’s bitcoin mining and micro-transaction device, though it indicated that this would expand with the launch of the 21 Bitcoin Library, a forthcoming command line interface and software package.  In a post on Medium 21 Inc envisions how its marketplace could allow users to rent out their computers as servers and to buy or sell queries to a zip code database in exchange for bitcoin, though these are just a few examples of what could be built on the platform.  As part of an effort to showcase how the marketplace could be used, 21.co released six apps on the service, a launch that included URL Tagger, Social Sentiment Analysis and Twitter Influence Ranking tools. 21 also released an overview of how apps could be published to the marketplace, with documentation on a four-step process for developers.  In statements, 21 described the offering as an attempt to simplify the process of signing up for APIs, which now requires users to provide information and credit card details, among other steps. Further, it contends that, with its platform, such economic activity can now take place without the need for users to have bank accounts or to trade and manage government-backed currencies during sales.  The startup wrote:  ""With a micropayments marketplace, we can essentially eliminate the fixed cost of sign up for any listed API. Just use your bitcoin wallet to do a one-shot purchase of a listed API, or set up a micropayment channel to do many purchases.""  Overall, the release is the latest showcase of how 21 is prioritizing the creation of bitcoin-based platforms that enable developers to unlock new use cases for the technology.  ""Even with these limitations, we think the 21 micropayments marketplace is an important step towards making digital currency useful for developers,"" the company wrote.  Notably, 21 Bitcoin Computer users are already using the hardware device for the creation of similar apps that allow for the monetization of social data and Wi-Fi connections, among other use cases.
