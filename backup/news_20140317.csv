42377004,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzpH,1395093639,A Taxonomy of Bitcoin Mixing Services for Policymakers,"As the first-ever technical workshop devoted to bitcoin research convened on the island of Barbados on 7th March, it was clear from the outset that several academic papers would be exploring various methods to compensate for bitcoin's inherent lack of anonymity.  For now, it's an academic endeavour, but it underlies the fundamental principle known as 'freedom of transaction'.  The International Financial Cryptography Association (IFCA), which organised the conference, has been at the center of this research work for 18 years. The burgeoning field of applied cryptography drives the mathematical science that makes digital anonymous value, and its transfer, possible.  At IFCA, CRYPTO, and other global conferences, cryptographers routinely assemble to present various theories and protocols that will allow a digital currency unit to emulate the privacy features of paper cash.  As applied to bitcoin specifically, these privacy-enhancing protocols can be organized into a taxonomy of mixing services for policymakers.  Tools against surveillance  Last year, Mercatus duo Jerry Brito and Andrea Castillo published ""Bitcoin: A Primer for Policymakers"" which touched only lightly on the advanced research into the privacy layers above bitcoin.  However, the privacy around bitcoin address data is no different than the privacy provided by Tor for anonymous web browsing and ultimately just as important for liberty and human dignity. Also similar to Tor, the network becomes more useful and robust as the level adoption increases.  [post-quote]  Just as Tor prevents people from learning your location or browsing habits, bitcoin privacy extensions prevent people from learning your bitcoin amounts and spending habits.  Tor assists in defending yourself against network surveillance and traffic analysis, while bitcoin assists in defending yourself against financial surveillance.  Adopted from ""The First 3 Generations of Bitcoin Mixing"" by Kristov Atlas, the following taxonomy provides a fundamental guide for practitioners as bitcoin spreads itself into each and every monetary regime existing within artificially-delineated boundaries.  Before various governments like Jordan, Singapore, Iran, and Russia decide to ban bitcoin outright, or significantly restrict its usage, they need to be aware of the potential limitations to such regulation and attempted surveillance.  Centralized mixing services  The first generation of bitcoin mixers operated as a standalone service where you could send your bitcoin, pay a small fee, and then receive different bitcoin than the ones that were sent. These were some of the earliest and most rudimentary bitcoin mixing services.  The successful bitcoin anonymization of these services depended on the total number of users and coins available for mixing, which is why larger exchange sites and bitcoin shopping platforms were used more frequently. If an exchange was large enough, bitcoin could be deposited and withdrawn without being traded – effectively mixing the customer's original coins.  Additional considerations of centralized mixing services are that you must trust the service not to steal your bitcoin and you must trust the service to protect your bitcoin from external theft.  Similar to VPNs, you must also trust the service not to maintain logs of the bitcoin address mixing and not to sell or turn over such records, both of which are difficult to verify.  Peer-based mixers  In an attempt to address the problems of a centralized model, the next generation of mixers relied on a 'team' of bitcoin users who all want to mix their coins together, gathering at the same place and time on the Internet.  Rather than a mixing service receiving bitcoin from a customer and performing the mixing itself, these peer-based mixers simply act as a meeting place for users to orchestrate mixing amongst themselves.  This model solves the problem of theft, because without a third party, the service is trustless. Protocols such as CoinJoin, SharedCoin, and CoinSwap allow multiple bitcoin users to get together, crafting a single bitcoin transaction in multiple stages, and sending their bitcoin to each others' destination addresses.  Other than the mixing server, none of the participants need to know the relationship between their starting address and destination address. This can be performed multiple times with multiple parties to further complicate traffic analysis of the block chain.  Also, according to Atlas, peer-based mixing solves the problem of record-keeping, because:  ""Cryptographic primitives such as cryptographic blinding, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), and Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge (SNARKs) can improve on peer-based mixing protocols so that, not only do the peers not need to know about each other's destination address, but the mixing server helping to orchestrate the mixing doesn’t know it, either.""  Atlas refers to this approach as 'blind mixing'.  Anonymous altcoins  Altcoins are cryptocurrencies derived from the Bitcoin protocol with some slightly modified properties.  Atlas believes that cryptocurrency exchanges featuring various altcoins can be incorporated into block chain-based technologies to form peer-to-peer exchanges. He states that ""once anonymous altcoins and decentralized exchanges are deployed, we will see these altcoins being used as off-ramps from and on-ramps to bitcoin, essentially acting as mixers.""  Improvements to the second generation of mixers include further decentralization of the mixing process by outsourcing the processing load to the altcoin's distributed network, rather than relying only on the mixing server and vastly increasing the total size of the user 'anonymity set'.  Leading the charge of anonymous altcoins is the Zerocoin team, which includes cryptographers Matthew Green and Ian Miers. After deciding to avoid the engineering complications of implementing Zerocoin on top of bitcoin, Green and his team began working on a standalone altcoin implementation dubbed 'Zerocash'.  Miers presented the Zerocash paperhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bitcoin14_submission_12.pdf, ""Rational Zero: Economic Security for Zerocoin with Everlasting Anonymity"", at the IFCA Bitcoin Workshop. Another privacy-enhancing paperhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/bitcoin14_submission_19.pdf, ""Increasing Anonymity in Bitcoin"", was presented by Amitabh Saxena.  Atlas correctly states that bitcoin core developers have so far been reluctant to incorporate mixing technologies directly into the core protocol. Aside from being politically unpalatable, it would also add computational overhead and potential complication, leaving the option of services outside of the core protocol as the primary method for maintaining fungibility and user-defined privacy.  Notably, bitcoin core developer Mike Hearn says that an upcoming version of bitcoinj will route all connections to the bitcoin network over Tor’s anonymity network.

42376998,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vziz,1395088753,Dutch Official Downplays Law Enforcement Need for Bitcoin Ban,"The Netherlands' Minister of Justice and Security Ivo Opstelten has issued statements suggesting that the digital currency should not be banned due to its connection to criminal practices.  The statements, published by Dutch news source Coincurant, come in light of recent high-profile, bitcoin-related arrests made by the country's law enforcement officials, as well as concern about the Internet's role in gun violence.  In comments the wider digital currency community is likely to find encouraging, Opstelten said that while the digital currency is used for illegal means, this concern can apply to other, more mainstream currencies and payment types.  Informal translations of the text indicate that Opstelten said:  ""Financial transactions for criminal activities are not reserved for cryptographic payment forms.""  The statement was made in response to parliamentary questions about the 21st January arrest of a US citizen who sold a semi-automatic pistol to Dutch law enforcement officials.  The sale was facilitated by a black market website protected by the Tor network.  More details  The questions were issued by two Dutch politicians, Peter Oskam and Eddy van Hijum, both members of the Christian Democratic Appeal party, who stressed the importance of scrutinizing the issue in the wake of this arrest, as well as the suicide of a Dutch teenager who purchased a firearm online.  The lawmakers were seeking to address the steps being taken by Opstelten and his agency to limit the purchase of firearms online. The correspondence suggested potential bans on bitcoin and the anonymous software system Tor as solutions to the stated concerns.  Opstelten's full remarks also indicated that international cooperation, for now, remains the best possible defense against bitcoin and its potential criminal uses.  The Ministry of Security and Justice  is a government body responsible for maintaining the rule of law in the Netherlands. Its tasks include providing for fair and effective punishment of criminals and coordinating counter-terrorism.  Community reaction  While promising, at least one prominent community member, who runs a financial newsletter serving the Netherlands and Belgium, was skeptical that such statements represented any larger thinking on behalf of the government.  Tuur Demeester  , owner of financial research firm Adamant Research, cited how Opstelten also mentioned that the G7's Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) is preparing to investigate virtual currencies, and implied such findings could trump any individual country's preliminary assessments.  Demeester indicated the most notable statement may have been Opstelten's mention of cooperation with the US on bitcoin issues.  ""My hunch is that going forward, the Dutch government will take a similar stance to that of the US: tolerance of Bitcoin, but with the attempt of taxing, controlling and steering it through a system of licenses and other regulations.""  His business partner at Debitcoin.org, Paul Buitink did not comment on the larger impact of the statements, but said he agreed with Opstelten's statements.  Bitcoin in the Netherlands  Research from the US Law Library of Congress indicates that the Netherlands has been among the more active countries when it comes to debating the impact of bitcoin on existing laws and regulation.  Bitcoin, nonetheless, has been growing in popularity in the Netherlands. Most recently, an entire Dutch street rebranded as ""Bitcoin Boulevard"" in order to attract bitcoin-using tourists, while the country's largest food delivery network began accepting bitcoin in November.  Sourceforge indicates that the Netherlands ranks seventh in terms of the number of official downloads of the Bitcoin-Qt wallet worldwide, trailing Canada with more than 128,000 downloads as of press time.

42376993,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzbR,1395082911,China's Temporary QR Code Ban Could Have Implications for Bitcoin's Future,"The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has placed a temporary ban on payments made by scanning quick-response (QR) codes with mobile devices.  The move by China's central bank, which was announced on 14th March, is aimed at stopping, at least for the moment, the upcoming launch of 'virtual credit cards' by major Internet companies.  Alibaba, China's leading e-commerce company, and Tencent, a popular Internet platform hosting social and mobile services, recently announced that they would seek to launch such virtual credit cards – which will utilize QR codes – as an alternative to traditional credit cards.  The PBOC cited security concerns as the reason for the decision. Both Alibaba and Tencent are currently communicating with the PBOC in the hopes of getting the green light for the launch of the services. However, reports suggest the companies are facing substantial hurdles in their deliberations.  Estimates suggest that Alipay processes around $660bn in payments annually from roughly 300 million users, while Tenpay has more than 100 million users and has gained significant ground in 2013 and 2014.  Although the halt in payments using such technology was not aimed at bitcoin or other digital currencies, QR codes remain an active part of the bitcoin peer-to-peer and customer-to-merchant transaction process globally.  As such, many in the digital currency community have debated whether such measures, if prolonged permanently, would have a positive or negative impact on bitcoin users.  Impact on bitcoin  Due to continued uncertainty about bitcoin's use in China, some in the community were troubled by the news. Reddit message boards debated such topics as whether digital currency exchanges would be targeted for similar reasons, though others maintained that due to bitcoin's decentralized nature, China could do little to stop overall use.  Eric Gu  , co-founder of BitAngelsClub, indicated that he sees the move as a troubling attempt to turn the clocks back on recent innovation in the financial services sector, and that it signals future concerns for bitcoin and other digital currencies.  ""As a hardcore bitcoiner I am deeply troubled by the news, I think it is back paddling from the Internet financial innovations in recent years, and the probability is much higher for the central bank to release tougher regulations against bitcoin.""  Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China, however, disagrees, telling CoinDesk that the measures ""won't really affect the bitcoin industry in China"", adding that this is because the ecosystem itself remains underdeveloped.  Said Lee:  ""Down the road, if bitcoin payments were to be made available in China, it would also very likely be affected by this disallowance of QR code payments. We are still far from that today.""  QR code risks  With many watching the events closely, there has been new interest in the PBOC's claims regarding QR code security.  Past research on QR codes indicates that the data transmission tools could potentially be used by malicious individuals to transact potentially harmful items aimed at facilitating larger fraud. However, top consumer security firms, such as Norton, provide tools that can help safeguard consumers against this risk.  Still, awareness of the risks, and the ways to protect against them, arguably remains low among those looking to take advantage of the system's benefits.  Further regulation  On 17th March  , the PBOC revealed that it may enact regulations that severely limit the ability of Internet companies to conduct financial services, barring them from all offline transactions.  The bank is also considering restrictive new caps on the kinds of payments that Alipay and Tenpay, the top emerging alternatives to China UnionPay, can transact. This includes setting a per-transaction limit of 1,000 RMB ($163), and a 10,000 RMB ($1,630) limit on annual spending for individual accountholders.  UnionPay, the world's largest card issuer, has been described as having a ""virtual monopoly"" on bankcard services in China, and is in the process of expanding its reach internationally.  Though the QR code halt may only be temporary, these moves signal that the PBOC is looking to restrict the growth of new, technology-enabled payment services. This could ultimately mean more hurdles are likely to arise for Alibaba and Tencent, as well as for alternative technologies such as bitcoin and related businesses.  CoinDesk will continue to monitor this developing story.

42377025,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzYv,1395076888,Bundesbank Board Member Warns Against 'Highly Speculative' Bitcoin,"Deutsche Bundesbank board member Carl-Ludwig Thiele has issued his second warning on bitcoin this year.  In an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published on Sunday, Thiele reiterated his position that bitcoins are not a means of payment, but are instead a highly speculative financial tool.  He pointed to several high-profile bitcoin heists over the last few weeks to back up his statements, German financial magazine Handelsblatt reports.  Thiele also talked about volatility, which is perhaps hardly surprising, since the price of bitcoin has dropped by almost half since he made his original statement in early January.  He further said that such volatility can undermine the seemingly cheaper online payments offered by bitcoin payment processors:  ""Bitcoin users often assume that Internet payments with bitcoin are cheaper than international bank transfers or paying with a credit card. They forget, however, that the price of bitcoins fluctuates greatly, among other things. Ultimately, the losses can quickly become considerably higher than transfer or credit card fees.""  Call for regulation  Thiele pointed out that digital currencies are a relatively recent phenomenon and that there is no regulatory framework that can deal with them. He added that the Bundesbank's Executive Board would like to see an appropriate way of dealing with them internationally.  Such regulations that exist are not harmonised, he said, and different states have different laws, or different ways of interpreting and applying them to digital currencies.  Thiele added that discussion about digital currencies among EU regulators is still in the early stages and that the European Banking Authority has formed a workgroup tasked with looking at digital currencies.  Previous warnings  Today's warning is not Thiele's first. Back in January, Thiele told Handelsblatt that bitcoins are a highly speculative investment and pointed out that European regulators have not taken any concrete steps to regulate digital currencies.  Thiele said the price of digital currencies is not being driven by fundamentals – a factor that breeds volatility. He also warned that there is simply no guarantee investors will be able to exchange their bitcoins in the future, adding that the Bundesbank has ""warned emphatically"" against these risks.  Previously, in December 2013, Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said that bitcoin is not an alternative to national currencies and that the driving factor behind demand for bitcoin is a purely speculative hope of big payouts for investors.  While the EU has done little to address digital currencies, regulators in some parts of the world are a bit more proactive.  New York State is at the forefront of the regulatory push. Last week the state started accepting applications for digital currency exchanges, which will be regulated under new state legislation that is expected to be enacted by the end of the second quarter of 2014.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/17/bundesbank-board-member-warns-against-highly-speculative-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/902ff88d91d06d305c7150d0d84ce9e7adaeea93-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376989,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vzXf,1395073591,Mexico's First Bitcoin ATMs Will Also Deal in Altcoins,"The Mexican border town of Tijuana is to see the launch of two digital currency-toting ATMs on Thursday or Friday of this week, and with an interesting twist – in addition to the expected provision of bitcoin, the ATMs will support litecoin and dogecoin too.  Tijuana is a popular spot for US tourists, including many geeky and potentially bitcoin-friendly college kids who venture south of the border to let their hair down. What happens in Tijuana stays in Tijuana, they say, apart from some less than legal 'souvenirs' that sometimes find their way back to the US.  The company launching the ATMs is called Bitcoin42, and it says that one of the units will accept US dollars and the other Mexican pesos, so it is clear much of the target audience is expected to show up with greenbacks.  Bitcoin42 says these aren't just the first bitcoin ATMs in Mexico, they are the first units in the whole of Latin America.  The ATM hardware is being provided by GenesisCoin, which shipped its first three units to Canada this week, though those have yet to be deployed.  Social contribution  ""Our main objective is a positive contribution to the potential of all living beings to develop, today and in the future. Our business model focuses on cultural, social, ecological, and economical projects that aim to tackle challenges in our society by developing creative solutions,"" the company said. It added:  ""Ethical and social responsibility is important to us. We are inspired by the Institute for Social Banking and the Economy for the Common Good, which received larger popularity since the banking crisis.""  Bitcoin42 is putting its money where its mouth is: the company will be giving 10% of all profits generated by the ATMs to non-profit associations in Tijuana. Customers will even be able to choose the cause they wish to donate to.  Bitcoin42 is also advocating the use of cyprocurrencies by non-profit organisations, as it believes cryptocurrencies can help non-profits reduce their administration costs and move funds in faster, with more transparency:  ""Through this, anybody can become a [truly] independent auditor, since one can provide information to verify balances and transactions, and also allow the public to see how much in donations has been received and where it went.""  Dog lovers  The company did not say why it chose to add dogecoin and litecoin to the list of supported currencies, but in a forum post one of the team members said dogecoin was proposed by the developer of the ATM – and that Bitcoin42 also ""really likes dogs"".  Dogecoin was never envisioned as a serious digital currency and as a result it doesn't get much attention from cryptocurrency businesses or investors, although there is a large and vibrant community behind it.  Last month a team of dogecoin lovers set up a DIY dogecoin ATM at the CoinFest digital currency festival in Vancouver, Canada.

Founded in early 2011, MetroDeal has seen a meteoric rise in popularity among the Philippines' 33 million active Internet users. It achieved annual revenue of $18m in 2012, and was projected to top $20m in revenue in 2013.  MetroDeal follows a template similar to US-based daily deal giants such as Groupon and LivingSocial. Deals run for a limited time and offer consumers deep discounts from a wide range of merchants.  The company trails only Rocket Internet-funded startup Lazada, which recently raised $250m in its Series E round, in overall site visitation among commerce websites.  MetroDeal is accepting bitcoin through a partnership with Coins.ph, a bitcoin exchange and bitcoin merchant directory provider serving the Philippines.  Founded by Ralph Wunsch, a former marketing manager at Austria-based discounts site Daily Deal, MetroDeal was reportedly designed from a public computer at a local McDonald's franchise before quickly taking off.  Checkout process  To purchase with bitcoin on MetroDeal, buyers first choose their desired deal and select ""Buy Now!""  Buyers must then log in with Facebook or with an email account before picking a payment method. Available options include credit and debit cards, bank deposits and bitcoin.  After selecting the bitcoin option, buyers simply scan the QR code and send payment to complete their purchase.  Bitcoin in Philippines  The news of MetroDeal's acceptance comes in the wake of a warning from Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), the central bank of the Philippines, to its consumers about the use of digital currencies.  BSP listed a number of concerns about the use of digital currencies, including their high volatility and lack of consumer protections, as well as the absence of regulation imposed on businesses servicing the emerging sector, in its statements.  Though the local community is small, the Philippines holds substantial untapped potential for bitcoin.  One of the largest potential use cases for bitcoin in the Philippines remains in the remittance market. In 2013, the country's international workers sent nearly $14bn to family members back home, often paying a substantial price through the traditional financial system for doing so.  Given MetroDeal's size, it could prove effective at raising awareness for bitcoin and its potential in the country.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/17/metrodeal-the-philippines-top-daily-deals-site-now-accepts-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d10a7c43acc3888bf8acdf010c66f8a2a2369764-1001x700.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Whether or nor he is the genius behind the ubiquitous cryptocurrency, it is obvious that he is a private man who shies away from the intrusion of the public eye.  In the latest chapter of the saga, Nakamoto has said in a statement issued through his recently hired lawyer, LA-based Ethan Kirschner, that he ""did not create, invent or otherwise work on bitcoin"".  'Unfamiliar' with bitcoin  ""I unconditionally deny the Newsweek report,"" Nakamoto said, adding that:  ""I am writing this statement to clear my name.""  The statement was initially published by Reuters blogger Felix Salmon on his Twitter feed, and Kirschner has confirmed to TechCrunch that it is genuine. Nakamoto stated that, until February, he had not heard of bitcoin, and it was his son who first told him about the cryptocurrency.  In an interview with Associated Press soon after the Newsweek article, he claimed he ""called the technology 'bitcom' [as he was] still unfamiliar with the term"".  Hard times  According to the statement, life has not been easy for Nakamoto – an American citizen living in Temple City, California.  Nakamoto has a background in engineering and does ""have the ability to program"", he said, but he has not been able to find steady work in the field for over 10 years – instead taking assignments as a ""labourer, polltaker and substitute teacher"".  Apparently, he discontinued his internet service in 2013, ""due to severe financial stress"". This is all at odds with what you would expect from a man who is said to hold $400m in bitcoins from his early mining efforts.  Furthermore, Nakamoto is trying to recover from prostate surgery undertaken in October 2012 and a stroke he suffered in October 2013, he stated.  Closing the statement, Nakamoto thanked people around the world ""who have offered me their support"" and asks for his privacy to be respected. ""This will be our last public statement on this matter,"" he says.    Dorian Nakamoto official statement/denial.

The last anyone heard from him was in the spring of 2011, when he said that he had “moved on to other things”.  Since the Newsweek article, an account supposedly linked to the inventor of bitcoin was used to post to the P2P Foundation's Ning page, stating: ""I am not Dorian Nakamoto"".  If indeed this anonymous individual is the real creator of bitcoin, the publication of irrefutable evidence to the fact would quickly put the issue to rest, and allow the beleaguered Californian some peace and quiet.

The money came from Pantera Capital Management LP, ""the hedge fund that manages money for Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) executives"", Bloomberg said. If true, it would be one of the largest single investments in a bitcoin-related business to date.  Bitstamp has been a huge beneficiary of the collapse of Mt.

When CoinDesk asked Kodric whether Bloomberg's report was accurate, he merely said: ""No comment"".  Bloomberg's story highlighted the incredible potential of this and future link-ups between Wall Street and Silicon Valley, as expertise in finance met technological excellence. Funds like Pantera's had the power to lift bitcoin businesses from startup obscurity into the big time.  ""Finance people are now recognizing the force multiplier of combining their deep knowledge of finance with new, possibly game-changing technologies,"" said Chris Larsen, CEO of Ripple Labs.  Pantera also contributed a portion of Ripple Labs' recent $9m funding round, along with Google and Lightspeed Ventures.  Pantera hasn't commented on this week's revelations, made by three people who knew of the deal, and the new fund has stayed quiet about other intentions and big deals.  New attraction  Bitcoin startups, taking a lead from Silicon Valley startups, have appealed more to tech venture capitalists and corporations for their big break. They will probably in future pay extra attention to very deep-pocketed Wall Street players. Wall Street, in turn, will demand a new breed of financially-focused and compliance-willing management teams to match its own involvement.  ""A group like that should be able to deliver the kinds of relationships that startups need. I’d take Pantera over a lot of other firms,"" said Brock Pierce, a California VC.  Bitstamp is UK-registered but reportedly has most operations in Slovenia. It was founded in 2011 by Kodric and Damijan Merlak. Since then it has established a reputation for stability and good management, and has an advantage in its location in the European Union with its integrated money transfer system.  It has always been compliant with financial regulations and users must have verified identification, something that has become more or less standard at bitcoin exchanges around the world, especially the current crop of new startups in Asia.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/03/17/bitstamp-got-10-million-from-fortress-linked-hedge-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/59ac0307277410bc25a1bc49bf7e7928b19f6675-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42376974,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6vwbF,1395050629,Texas Regulators Warn About Risks of 'Trendy' Digital Currencies,"Regulators in Texas have warned digital currencies like bitcoin are volatile and probably more suited to young people than retirees, the Dallas Morning News has reported.  Describing digital currencies as ""very, very trendy"" right now, Joseph Rotunda, director of enforcement at the Texas State Securities Board, said that all the ""buzz"" around digital currencies had led people to look only at the positives and not the risks.  Rotunda said it wasn't just about bitcoin, but the myriad other digital currencies popping up every week that presented a risk to investors.  ""There’s more of them in production right now, in development. It’s a real fertile ground,"" he said. He admitted such investments could prove useful, but only for younger people and not those looking for future security.  ""An investment tied to digital currencies may be suitable for someone in their 20s, in their 30s. When you’re talking about a retiree’s nest egg, that may not be something they’d want to subject to this type of a risk.""  Risks for unaware investors  Such warnings from government regulators have become fairly commonplace in recent months.  ""In many ways, digital currencies operate as 'online cash,' only this type of currency is extremely volatile and can disappear the same way your money disappears when you lose your wallet,"" said John Morgan, Texas securities commissioner.  Rotunda also pointed out that trust remains a huge issue in the unregulated space, in the security systems and infrastructure, accounting practices and overall business models of those providing digital currency services.  The level of anonymity digital currencies provide users also created risks, he said, adding:  ""That makes it hard from a regulatory standpoint to regulate those transactions, but it also fosters an environment that caters to money laundering to conceal transactions to all sorts of situations where a promoter could be playing with investors’ money without their knowledge.""  Late last week, the Texas State Securities Board also warned energy firm Balanced Energy LLC with a cease and desist letter against getting involved in bitcoin, saying the company had not fully disclosed the risks of bitcoin to its investors, especially those associated with wild value swings.  Shavers 'Ponzi' case update  Yip also referred to Texas' own Trendon T Shavers, who gained notoriety last July when he managed to raise 700,000 BTC at his company Bitcoin Savings and Trust (BTCST). The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) described the operation as a bitcoin Ponzi scheme.  Shavers, incidentally, denied his was a Ponzi scheme and was actually never charged with any criminal offence. He did not accept any currency other than bitcoin, he said, and appeared not to keep any useful records of his transactions.  The SEC filed a civil complaint against him at the beginning of this month, posting a transcript of Shavers' interview online, in which he referred to his scheme as merely one of lending and bitcoin value speculation based on the fluctuating price at Mt. Gox in early 2013.
