42425488,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwxh,1393285756,"Playboy Plus, a Playboy Brand Website, is Now Accepting Bitcoin","Playboy, the iconic media company that publishes Playboy magazine, is now accepting bitcoin payments for its adult entertainment content through at least one of its web properties.  Though not yet formally announced to the public, the payment option is currently live on the Playboy Plus website, and is available to those purchasing one-month, six-month and lifetime memberships through Georgia-based merchant processor BitPay.  Formerly the Playboy Cyber Club, according to its official Twitter account, Playboy Plus is an online component to Playboy magazine that provides original nude picture content.  Playboy's online branded assets are operated by Montreal-based adult entertainment conglomerate MindGeek, and as such, the bitcoin rollout appears to be part of a broader move toward acceptance from MindGeek, not necessarily Playboy.  The bitcoin payment option appears only accessible through plus.playboy.com, and does not appear when users are prompted for payment via the official Playboy website. iPlayboy, the company's online magazine archives, is not yet enabled with the payment option either as of press time.  Why MindGeek matters  While bitcoin's first association with the Playboy brand may grab the most headlines, the addition of MindGeek (formerly Manwin Group) to the bitcoin ecosystem is undoubtedly more significant.  MindGeek owns a number of major subsidiary brands, including Brazzers and Reality Kings - which themselves operate roughly 30 websites each. Further, MindGeek operates top brands such as YouPorn, PornHub.com and Mofos.  Avi Bitton, CTO of California-based adult movie studio Wicked Pictures, told CoinDesk that Playboy Plus is just the latest in what could become a measured rollout of the payment option across all of MindGeek's major websites, though he stopped short of confirming such plans.  ""It's a payment option. Think of a large company that owns domains rolling out a payment option. You think that's going to probably percolate to multiple sites? That'd be a good framework for working things, right?""  Bitton describes himself as a bitcoin advocate and enthusiast working to facilitate adoption in the industry as a whole, though he is not affiliated with MindGeek or Playboy.  Trials begin  News of the MindGeek trial first serviced earlier this February via reddit user Bowiestar, who broke the news that IKnowThatGirl.com, a subsidiary of Mofos and MindGeek, was accepting bitcoin payments for membership plans. The Brazzers brand has been rumored to integrate bitcoin payments, but indications are it has not formally done so.  Speculation began after a reddit Ask Me Anything session in January, in which Brazzers responded cryptically to user questions about whether it would soon accept the digital currency.  Reddit user Bowiestar, who told CoinDesk he spoke with the Brazzers press team, indicated that if successful, the trial could roll out to more, or possibly all, of MindGeek's websites.  The IKnowThatGirl trial is also being facilitated by BitPay, adding evidence to the idea the company is conducting a measured rollout. Notably, both Porn.com and Naughty America, the two most recent additions to the list of bitcoin merchants in the adult industry, also accept bitcoin via BitPay.  Adding to confusion is that the Manwin brand is still displayed on the company's bitcoin payment prompts on Playboy Plus, despite the fact that the company recently rebranded as MindGeek.  Neither MindGeek nor Playboy responded to requests for further comment, though Bitton suggested that so far reception has been positive internally at MindGeek.  Purchasing  Users who want to purchase membership plans via IKnowThatGirl.com or Playboy Plus can do so by visiting the website and clicking to sign up for a subscription.  At this stage, users will be prompted to create an account and choose their payment method - credit card, check or bitcoin. The following was taken from IKnowThatGirl, though the Playboy Plus checkout is similar.  Bitcoin users will then need to enter their email address and select their membership plan. Options at IKnowThatGirl include a one-month membership for $39.95 or a year-long membership for $119.95. The lifetime membership on Playboy Plus is the most expensive package at $499.99.  Finally, users will be prompted with a QR code from BitPay to complete the transaction.  Impact  Adult entertainment websites seem increasingly inclined to test the waters with bitcoin payments, despite noted limitations with subscription payments. Coinbase offers periodic push payments, but these don't provide regular, automatic billing.  In recent weeks, Porn.com and Naughty America both began taking bitcoin, with Porn.com even increasing its sales by 10% with the payment option. Naughty America has declined to release exact figures, but has been enthusiastic about the results.  But, in terms of global web traffic, the addition of MindGeek's websites to the list of bitcoin merchants in the adult entertainment world would be significant.  According to lifestyle blog TheRichest:  ""They are among the top three bandwidth consumption companies on Earth, operating more than 73 websites in all - free, paid and webcam. It has been reported that the company brings in over $200m annually.""  Pornhub.com ranks #84 in the world in terms of web traffic and is #53 in the United States. Similarly, YouPorn.com ranks #105 globally and #117 in the United States in overall site visitation.  In addition, the Playboy brand is likely to add validity to the movement given its leadership position in the industry.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/24/playboy-plus-a-playboy-brand-website-is-now-accepting-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16c324c4e7d88944b2bcf6646c46da1e0285e070-1021x723.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425484,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwnh,1393283013,Pony Botnet Virus Steals $220k from 30 Types of Digital Wallets,"In what is being called one of the most ambitious cyberattacks affecting virtual currency to date, Chicago-based IT security services provider Trustwave has revealed that a crybercrime ring known as Pony botnet is using a Trojan virus to steal from 30 types of digital currency wallets.  Trustwave  researchers found that credentials for approximately 700,000 digital wallet, email and desktop accounts have been compromised, and that up to $220,000 had been stolen from 85 digital currency wallets as of the time of writing.  Ziv Mador, director of security research at Trustwave, told CoinDesk that consumer and merchant wallets were both affected, and that bitcoins, litecoins, primecoins and feathercoins had been stolen in the attack.  But, what makes the Pony botnet unique, Mador said, is the breadth of its assault:  ""The new thing about this complaint is that it was widely spread. The Pony malware affected hundreds of thousands of machines and scanned for digital wallets from 30 virtual currencies on those computers.""  Trustwave indicates that while the attack has been persisting for months, it stopped suddenly on 24th February. However, in talks with other media outlets, Trustwave suggested it believes the cybercriminal network is still operating.  Initial data  Mador indicates that Trustwave has been following Pony botnet since September 2013. The official company blog post on the findings revealed that virtual currencies weren't the only digital assets attacked, as 600,000 website login credentials have been stolen by the group to date.  The $220,000 total represents the maximum amount stolen, as once cybercriminals have obtained a user's wallet.dat file, Trustwave noted that both parties share the file and that the true owner is impossible to reveal.  The total confirmed theft so far includes 335 bitcoins, 280 litecoins, 33 primecoins and 46 feathercoins. Trustwave provides a full list of the affected currencies, as well as charts that detail the coordinated efforts of Pony botnet's attacks in its blog post.  Stolen passwords across all affected digital assets - not just digital currency wallets - were most commonly retrieved from consumers in Germany, Poland and Italy, with roughly 50% of stolen passwords originating in these locations.  Protecting your wallet from attacks  Trustwave noted that Pony botnet likely found virtual wallets attractive, given their inherent qualities that provide for irreversible transactions, and the ease with which the currencies can be exchanged for fiat.  Still, relatively simple protections can stop Pony botnet's virus. Said Mador:  ""If they use that option and encrypt their wallets with a strong key, then they should be fine, even if the malware were to infect the digital wallet, the botnet would not be able to generate transactions from that wallet.""  Those who believe their wallet may have been compromised by the attack can use a free tool provided by Trustwave that searches for affected wallets by public keys.

42425478,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwdh,1393275250,Japan's Top Regulators Suggest Mt. Gox Intervention Unlikely,"With no timeline issued yet from Mt. Gox as to when it will once again allow the transfer of funds to third-party services - and signs of communication from the notoriously tight-lipped Japan-based company appearing less likely, the exchange's global customers began to turn to Japanese financial authorities on Monday for potential recourse.  However, the country's financial authorities are reportedly distancing themselves from any potential responsibility, should the troubled exchange default on its service obligations.  The Wall Street Journal  reported 24th February that Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA), which oversees the country's banking, insurance, securities and exchange sectors, does not view the supervision of digital currency exchanges as part of its obligations.  Speaking to the Journal, representatives from the FSA said:  ""Bitcoin isn't a currency; it works as an alternative to currencies, like gold. The FSA is in charge of currency-based services. Therefore, bitcoin exchanges are not a subject to our regulatory oversight.""  The news comes just hours after CEO Mark Karpeles resigned from the board of directors at Bitcoin Foundation, a move that caused a modest price recovery occurring on the network to stutter, and amid increasingly vocal protests from users.  Major financial agencies follow  While the news from the FSA is undoubtedly disheartening for exchange users, other government and private entities could still step in to provided relief if and when it's needed. Though, many of these organisations are currently taking a similar position as the FSA.  The Journal revealed that Bank of Japan, Japan's central bank, has stated it is ""not in a position"" to regulate bitcoin exchanges. Likewise, Japan's Ministry of Finance, a cabinet-level government financial entity, adopted a similar sentiment in correspondences with the media outlet.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, which has jurisdiction over IT issues, was less clear in its stance, saying.  ""We are not in a position to make any judgments on this matter.""  The future of Mt. Gox  Despite the fact that Mt. Gox had previously suggested a relationship with the FSA, the agency told the report it has not issued the troubled exchange any operational advice in recent weeks, suggesting that intervention in the event of its potential failure is unlikely.  Still, despite the fact that fear of a Mt. Gox default is spreading, sources close to Mt. Gox suggest that the exchange may be near a solution.  Former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem indicated on reddit today that ""good news [is] on the horizon for people who have funds stuck in MtGox"", though he did not elaborate on the announcement.

42425480,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwfh,1393264426,New JPMorgan Report Weighs in on Bitcoin's Mt. Gox Problem,"Just weeks after JPMorgan released its first report on bitcoin, the US-based multinational financial services company has weighed in on ongoing issues related to major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox.  Authored by the company’s head of global FX strategy, John Normand, the new one-page report – available publicly to JPMorgan's clients – draws comparisons between bitcoin exchanges and traditional central banks.  Perhaps, most notably, Norman addressed the inability of Mt. Gox customers to transfer funds to third parties, writing:  ""If such a restriction sounds a bit like the exchange controls that pop up intermittently with fiat currencies (Cyprus in 2013, Argentina this year), that’s because there are some parallels.""  He added: ""From a corporate or investor perspective, an exchange control is any restriction which limits financial transfers or imposes a different exchange rate for certain transactions.""  Normand's original report concluded that though bitcoin had some benefits, certain issues – including its price volatility and the lack of a central authority – would limit its usefulness for merchants, investors and consumers.  The latest report, while also critical of bitcoin, indicates interest in digital currencies remains at JPMorgan and that Normand's report is not simply a one-off project.  The Mt. Gox saga  The report did pay particular attention to the ongoing Mt. Gox ""saga"", ultimately concluding that recent events show virtual currencies can give rise to two-tier markets and convertibility risks.  JPMorgan spoke broadly about the challenges experienced by Bitstamp, BTC-e and Mt. Gox, and suggested that the DDoS attacks faced by the companies amounted to a ""security breach"", though no bitcoins or customer personal information has been compromised by the attack.  ""Due to a security breach affecting all three of the major platforms for swapping bitcoins and fiat currencies (it has been termed transaction malleability), all platforms halted customer withdrawals for some period of time.""  It correctly noted that two exchanges have restarted transfers, and that Mt. Gox plans to do so.  Price volatility  Norman indicated that the current data shows prices are depressed across all exchanges because of the ongoing issues with Mt. Gox, and that this has lead to below-average trading volumes. Furthermore, he added that prices are likely down due to the belief Mt. Gox bitcoins will be later sold on other exchanges, potentially impacting the market.  The author credited this decline as ""reflecting some discomfort with broader market architecture"", a claim that is given credence by the many reddit threads devoted to speculating on the company's future as well as the future of the bitcoins still in its exchange.  Such speculation was likely heightened by CEO Mark Karpeles' decision to step down from the Bitcoin Foundation board.  An optimistic conclusion?  Though Normand suggests his opinion differs, he did indicate it was possible to view the events at Mt. Gox in a positive light for bitcoin, saying:  ""The optimistic view of these events is that a two-tier market in a virtual currency is more benign than one in fiat currencies because it reflects operational risks around a particular exchange rather than those surrounding an entire sovereign and its financial system.""  Still, Normand suggested that he believes the events are proof virtual currencies will require intermediaries, and therefore not be able to deliver the sweeping cost savings they currently provide in the absence of such financial networks in the future.  ""From that perspective, it will be difficult to ensure than virtual currencies deliver frictionless exchange as they evolve over time,"" he concluded.

42425476,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwbh,1393261233,Australian Government Tracks All Bitcoin to AUD Conversions,"The Australian government is keeping a close eye on bitcoin, but not on the regulatory front. Rather, it is tracking every conversion from bitcoin into Australian dollars, and vice-versa.  The government agency doing the snooping is the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac). The centre is tasked with countering money laundering and terrorist finance, so it is only logical that it would track anonymous transactions.  Tracking bitcoin-related transactions  Austrac CEO John Schmidt told lawmakers that Australia collects data on all international fund transfers, including bitcoin conversions, ZDnet reports.  ""At some point, a person will be purchasing bitcoin using Australian dollars, for example, and then if they are dealing in substances or services, will want to convert those bitcoins back into the legitimate currencies of where ever they are, so they can gain the benefit of them.”  This is where it gets interesting. Because the centre gets international transfer instructions, it is possible to identify transactions made by people purchasing bitcoins.  Schmidt added that most countries have the same capability as Australia, but it is unclear whether they use it. He added that some prosecutions have already resulted from intelligence collected by the centre.  The CEO argued that bitcoin is a commodity used to transfer value rather than a legitimate currency. When bitcoins are converted into AUD, Austrac can identify those transactions.  Bitcoin is not a threat, yet  Schmidt also issued a warning that if bitcoin gains more independence from fiat currency it will become more attractive to criminal organizations that need to channel money around. In that case, international cooperation will be necessary, as Schmidt points out:  ""Because they will operate on servers in jurisdictions around the world, and use very sophisticated methods to move and hide their identities. It's when you have the international cooperation [...] that is the answer to being able to stop that criminal behaviour.""  Interestingly, Schmidt pointed out that Austrac is still not able to quantify the size of the bitcoin market in Australia, but he doesn’t see it as a major threat. He pointed out that people are gambling on the prospective value of bitcoin rather than using it for transactions.  ""At this point in time, when you consider all the existing threats we face from the criminal perspective, they are not top of the list,"" Schmidt concluded.

42422944,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1yn7h,1393257763,Following the Money: Geographic Dispersion of VC Bitcoin Investment,"CoinDesk releases its 'State of Bitcoin 2014' report tomorrow. Here we have the second part of a two-part series, which features an exclusive look at some of the data from the report.  This article examines the geographic dispersion of VC investment in Bitcoin companies to date.  Note: As with yesterday's article the below analysis is drawn solely from publicly disclosed venture capital investments.  Relatively large number of VC-backed Bitcoin companies are based outside North America  The world’s first decentralized currency features a relatively decentralized geographic investment footprint, with 40% of all VC-backed Bitcoin companies based outside North America (Chart 1).  Chart 1: Regional Comparison - Number of VC-backed Bitcoin Companies  It is also interesting to note that Asia, with nine Bitcoin companies, has a sizable lead in terms of its total number of venture-backed VC companies as compared to Europe, which is home to just three companies.  While Asia and Europe together roughly equal the total number of Bitcoin companies housed in North America, the lion’s share of VC dollars (81%) to date have been invested in North American companies (Chart 2).  Chart 2: Regional Comparison - VC $s Invested in Bitcoin Companies  Table 1: Regional Comparison - VC-backed Bitcoin Companies  RegionsValue ($m)No. of companiesAvg./RegionAsia13.391.5Europe5.631.9North America78.6184.4Total97.5303.2  US-based Bitcoin companies in particular have received the vast majority of funding, with 70% of the total venture dollars invested, followed by Canada at 11% and China in third place with 8% of total funding (Chart 3).  Chart 3: Country Comparison - VC $s Invested in Bitcoin Companies  The United States is home to 16 of the 30 VC-backed Bitcoin companies (53%), with China in a distant second place with just three VC-backed Bitcoin companies (10%) (see Table 2).  Table 2: Country Comparison - VC-backed Bitcoin Companies  CountriesValue ($m)No. of companiesAvg./Country ($m)Australia0.720.3Canada10.525.3China8.032.7Singapore3.821.9South Korea0.820.4Sweden0.610.6United Kingdom5.022.5United States68.1164.3Total97.5303.2  Vast majority of VC-backed Bitcoin companies are based outside Silicon Valley  One of the questions which has arisen over the last year is whether Bitcoin startups will be geographically decentralized or concentrate in a particular tech hub, such as Silicon Valley?  Chart 4: Silicon Valley vs Rest of the World: Number of VC-backed Bitcoin Companies  So far just a little over one-quarter of all VC-backed Bitcoin companies reside in Silicon Valley (Chart 4).  While this figure would seem to suggest that the Valley has not yet secured its place as a dominant location for Bitcoin startups, when we examine the dispersion of VC dollars invested to date the picture is less clear.  Chart 5: Silicon Valley vs Rest of the World - VC $s Invested in Bitcoin Companies  When we look at the dispersion of venture investment we see that Silicon Valley-based Bitcoin firms have received over a half of the total venture investment in Bitcoin ecosystem companies to date (Chart 5).  This imbalance between the relatively small number of companies located in Silicon Valley and its much larger share of the total investment pie can largely be attributed to a single San Francisco-based company, Coinbase, which by itself has received over $31 million in two venture rounds in 2013.  The amount of money Coinbase has raised also represents just under one-third of the total publicly disclosed investment in Bitcoin companies to date.  Table 3: Four Largest VC-backed Bitcoin Companies  CompanyClassificationTotal Funding ($m)*HeadquarteredCoinbasePayment Processor31.1San FranciscoBitAccessFinancial Services10.0OttawaRipple LabsFinancial Services9.0San FranciscoCircle Internet FinancialUnknown9.0Boston  *Note: figures only reflect publicly disclosed total funding received to date.  Conclusion  One of the key catalysts propelling Bitcoin’s momentum in the past year has been the substantial financial investment made by the venture capital community in Bitcoin and its surrounding ecosystem.  Much of the attention has been focused on the actual size of investment, with significant discussion generated by the $9m invested in Jeremy Allaire's still-wrapped-in-mystery startup, Circle, and Coinbase’s subsequent $25m Series B round.  While it’s true that money provides Bitcoin startups with the funds necessary to launch products and services which will increase adoption, the contributions which VCs can make to Bitcoin beyond simply providing deep pockets should not be underestimated.  For example, over the last several decades Silicon Valley has worked hard to establish relationships in government, and these regulatory relationships may play an even more important role in shaping Bitcoin's prospects than future rounds of funding.  Many venture capitalists have also established a strong voice in the public discourse on topics such as how to generate additional economic growth. Politicians and regulators in areas struggling to create new jobs should perhaps tread carefully as they explore regulating what many believe is one of the biggest technological opportunities since the Internet.  There is also the feeling by many that, in certain corners of the ecosystem, Bitcoin could benefit from some additional 'adult supervision' of venture capitalists.  Overall, given the combined resources, relationships and influence which venture capitalists possess, no other alternative currency in history has benefitted from the same level of institutional support as that enjoyed by Bitcoin.

42425487,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwrh,1393252594,Penn State Students Launch Bitcoin Club with Grand Ambitions,"While many see cryptocurrencies merely as a means to personal gain via mining or investment, a group of students at Penn State University think that digital currencies can also offer a more philanthropic way of doing business.  To that end, Penn State University Bitcoin Club has been created by six ambitious young students with a strong positive vision for the future of bitcoin.  The club was co-founded by Patrick Cines and Ryan McCabe, both investors in bitcoin and litecoin, and who met on reddit.  McCabe has invested about $2,500, which he expects to make back over the next two months. In turn, Cines has spent $1,800 on an upmarket case for the miner in his dorm room, and says he has made a significant profit from mining – which he spends on computer gear.  The club isn’t about making profit, though, and the pair are keen to stress that it is not their aim to encourage new members into mining or investment. Instead, they have more philanthropic goals.  Encouraging bitcoin business  With their mix of business and tech backgrounds, they are joining a new generation of entrepreneurial bitcoiners using the digital currency for business development.  In the short term, their aims for the club include using bitcoin to help small businesses grow, said Cines:  “Small businesses are one of the cornerstones of America, so it would only be fair that we continue to support small businesses by helping them prosper.”  They plan to find help small businesses integrate bitcoin into their finances in order to expand revenue. Promoting the acceptance of digital currencies is also part of their plan.  “I think that, in the future, bitcoin will be further integrated into our society. It is only inevitable that we have a global currency to advance a continuing globalized economy,” said Cines. He added:  “As of now, a lot of regulatory agencies are cracking down on bitcoin. That’s why countries like the United States have to show the world that bitcoin should be viewed not as a threat, but an asset.”  Thinking big  The club’s not just about helping businesses, either. McCabe says they remain true to bitcoin’s idealistic roots: “You do have to have some sort of liberal mindset, because it is still a new thing that people don’t understand. You have to be open to new concepts.”  “As a long-term goal, we want to help other philanthropic organisations by donating bitcoin,” he added.  One of their aims is to eventually help support the annual Penn State ‘THON’ – a dance marathon which last year raised $12.8m for the Four Diamonds Fund, a paediatric cancer charity.  The pair are even converting their parents to bitcoin. McCabe convinced his dad to invest $1,300 in a mining computer at Christmas, which has already returned $550. “It’s making much more than the bluechips they’re invested in,” said Cines.  The pair are optimistic about the future. Cines has big dreams about where the digital currency might go next.  “I’d love to see the day when I can pay my tuition fees in bitcoin, or add money to my meal points by scanning a QR code and sending bitcoin.”  If their ambition is anything to go by, that day could be closer than we think.

42425474,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwTh,1393248969,Hong Kong to Get First Offline Bitcoin Store,"Hong Kong is about to get a rather unusual shop: an offline bitcoin store, launched by the Asia Nexgen Bitcoin Exchange (ANXBTC).  A 400-square-foot premises seems an unusual setting for the world of digital currency, but ANXBTC believes the move makes a lot of sense.  The exchange’s CEO Lo Ken-bon told the South China Morning Post that the biggest problem faced by bitcoin lovers in Hong Kong is that they simply can’t get a hold of them:  “So far, people have to put money in and trade it through an online exchange. Now, you can walk into the store, hand over your cash, and send the bitcoins to your digital wallet.”  Jumping through hoops  In order to buy bitcoins in the new shop, buyers will have to verify their identity and state their address – this is necessary to meet local anti-money laundering regulations.  There is another regulatory issue: Hong Kong views digital currencies as virtual commodities rather than currencies.  The Hong Kong Monetary Authority simply doesn’t want to deal with bitcoin, as it is not in its purview; therefore ANXBTC will have to operate the shop as a vending machine, with no exchange of money involved in its business.  That is to say, customers’ money will buy bitcoin the commodity, not bitcoin the currency.  This isn't news to anyone who has been following developments in Hong Kong: the first Robocoin ATMs coming to Hong Kong are classified as vending machines too.  Regulation on its way?  Hong Kong hasn’t yet taken any drastic measures on bitcoin. Regulatory action does not appear very likely at this point, but the machinery of government may be about to slowly grind into action.  Hong Kong’s Customs and Excise Department is reportedly considering which government body is supposed to be investigating possible bitcoin regulation, the South China Morning Post has reported.  Furthermore, Hong Kong regulators issued a bitcoin warning earlier this year, saying that they are closely monitoring developments with regards to digital currencies and are cooperating with regulators in mainland China and the rest of the region.  However, since the new bitcoin shop is set to open on Friday, February 28th, we can assume that ANXBTC is fairly certain it will be able to operate in spite of any regulatory ambiguity in the near future.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/24/hong-kong-to-get-first-offline-bitcoin-store,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/06f5b8ddfe125225784229474f1364f96507052b-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

If successful, Neo promises to engrave 24th February 2014 as a landmark date in bitcoin's history. Economist, author, and bitcoin fan Tuur Demeester attended today's launch and is hopeful it will set a precedent for similar bitcoin services everywhere:  ""Bitcoin is a hero who gives financial autonomy back to the people, that's the gist of Neo's marketing campaign. This is a message that really speaks to the distressed population here in Cyprus, who are now realizing that not only can they use bitcoin to regain some essential personal freedoms, but also that they can turn this crisis into an opportunity.""  He continued: “I think we're now in a period comparable to that of 1994-95, when companies like GeoCities, Yahoo, and Microsoft made the internet useful and easy to access for a broad segment of the population. In my view, Neo & Bee is making an admirable (and hitherto unprecedented) effort to bridge the gap from the geeky Bitcoin culture towards the general public.""  How Neo works  All customer deposits at Neo's bank-without-a-bank are held in full reserve, in BTC. Customers may use either bitcoins or Euros, and can choose either Euro-pegged accounts with fiat value limits or ones that offer ""full exposure to the bitcoin price level"".  This offers the public access to the benefits of bitcoin without needing to worry about wallet security, online service hacks, or even being technologically literate at all. Customers can consult face to face with service representatives.  Neo will also help reduce the risk of those price-level exposed customers by offering time-locked accounts guaranteed to hold a certain amount of fiat value even if bitcoin's value drops. For the company, there's an advantage if the price rises instead.  Anyone can audit the company at any time and prove their funds are indeed being held in reserve, since Neo's addresses will be available for inspection on the bitcoin block chain. Even if the company disappears, the bitcoins are still yours.  What Neo doesn't do at this stage is lend money. Imagine a 'physical bitcoin wallet', or if you prefer, a bank that keeps your money safe and makes transactions simple (imagine!) and you have Neo & Bee.  About Bee  Bee functions like a bitcoin-based debit card system – offering merchant terminals and cards with EMV chip and PIN technology, with the added bonus of faster settlement processing times and lower fees. And, of course, no chargebacks.  Bee is technically a separate business entity but operates under the same umbrella as Neo. CEO Danny Brewster, who has personally invested €6m getting the business off the ground, described it to the Cyprus Mail as follows:  “Neo and Bee are two separate brands that fall under the same roof. Neo is a physical portal for people to get educated on the bitcoin technology. They can also buy bitcoins directly from us, but we won’t sell to them until we know they got the right understanding of the technology.”  Both Neo and Bee will comply with banking laws and regulations, but free from the influence of the EU Central Bank. The last part of that sentence should prick up plenty of ears in Cyprus, and it's no accident the company chose it as the place to get things started.  The island nation has a history as a financial services center, but it was the 2012-13 Cypriot Banking/Financial Crisis that really ignited a desire for something other than traditional banking.  The crisis  The events of March-April 2013 have become infamous in the financial world.  Faced with widespread banking insolvency (a knock-on effect from Greece's government debt crisis), Cyprus agreed to a bailout deal that would close the country's second largest bank and planned a ""bank deposit levy"" of 6.7% for all accounts under €100,000 and 9.9% for those over.  Depositors at the closed bank would take a haircut of up to 40%. Local banks immediately suspended business to prevent a run. The deal, proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Eurogroup, European Commission (EC), and European Central Bank, was promoted as targeting wealthy foreign citizens of other countries (mainly Russia) using Cypriot banks for tax avoidance, but many around the world saw it as a harbinger of government confiscations to come as other Western world treasuries ran out of money.  The deal's image wasn't helped when news emerged that many of Cyprus' wealthier depositors had been able to transfer money out of their accounts online through branches still open for business in the UK, leaving others to shake their fists at non-functional ATMs – or threaten to drive bulldozers through their windows.  Interest in bitcoin skyrocketed in Cyprus and around the world, driving prices to a record $266 average and even over $300 in China, and causing naysayers to scream ""bubble!"". Though the value dropped shortly after, bitcoin's status as a desirable asset and investment of serious value was sealed.  The future  Neo & Bee launched an IPO on bitcoin equities exchange Havelock Investments in September 2013, and it currently has a share price of 0.00328 BTC and a market cap of 9016.0102 BTC ($5.21m at today's prices).  While its services are available only to Cypriot residents at present, the company has big plans to expand throughout the European Union in future. Neo says there are also plans to open a second branch in Cyprus within a month.  Neo & Bee, a subsidiary of UK based company LMB Holdings, intends to make money through value spreads, a trading desk and simply by 'going long' on bitcoin - buying the bitcoins of merchants it services in a similar fashion to other existing payment processing companies like Coinbase and BitPay.  CEO Brewster also claims to be interested in other block chain-based applications like autonomous legal contracts and derivatives, and has a grand vision to turn Cyprus into a Silicon Valley-like incubation hub for bitcoin businesses.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/24/bank-like-bitcoin-portal-neo-opens-first-branch-in-cyprus,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f59c20e46e82a0dfa08f797e285afd8831c1f08-2560x1440.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425475,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwVh,1393236073,BTC China Lowers Trading Fees to 0.1%,"Chinese bitcoin exchange BTC China has announced it will lower trading commission fees from 0.3% to 0.1% for all trades executed after midday China time (4:00 am GMT) today, 24th February.  It will also retain its ‘maker-taker’ fee model, meaning those placing limit orders at prices set by them (market ‘makers’) will still be exempt from all fees, and actually receive a 0.1% rebate. The model is useful because it adds to market liquidity.  BTC China had previously reduced fees for withdrawal into Chinese yuan from 1% to 0.5% on 3rd January.  The company had been China’s largest and busiest bitcoin trader until December last year, when the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) placed a series of new restrictions on deposits to and withdrawals from exchanges via banks and third-party payment processors. Trading volumes at all exchanges fell together with bitcoin prices as traders rushed to cash out.  Market management  Since then bitcoin exchanges have jostled for market share with a series of innovations and interpretations of the rules, with some suggestions that true trading volumes were being manipulated to gain attention. Most exchanges are able to accept donations by channeling them through corporate bank accounts, and BTC China also offers a deposit-by-voucher system.  BTC China itself reduced trading fees to 0% in September 2013, before raising them to 0.3% in December in an attempt to mollify the central bank’s concerns that the market had become overheated and could cause disruption to the mainstream financial system.  They may not go any lower than the current model, though. BTC China CEO Bobby Lee admitted in January that the company would not have abolished fees altogether had it known the PBOC would react as it did, and said such 0% fee models benefited high-frequency traders and speculators over ordinary traders and bitcoin miners.  Besides ease of access, fees have offered another way for Chinese exchanges to compete. Rivals Huobi and OKCoin have maintained mostly 0% fee models even since the new restrictions.  Low trading fees brought in hordes of new traders and saw Chinese exchanges become wildly popular in 2013, probably even acting as a catalyst for bitcoin’s sudden value rise to record highs in the last quarter of that year.  Bitcoin value on Huobi and OKCoin was around the 3780 CNY ($620) mark at the time of writing, with BTC China marginally higher at 3801 CNY ($623).

42425481,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwhh,1393227048,All Mt. Gox Twitter Posts Removed,"In a move sure to unsettle its waiting customers, Mt. Gox has removed all posts from its official Twitter feed. Readers started noticing the missing tweets just a short time after CEO Mark Karpeles resigned his seat on the Bitcoin Foundation's Board of Directors.  The Twitter account has over 27,800 followers, making it one of the most followed in the bitcoin universe. According to Twittercounterhttp://twittercounter.com/MtGox, that total had increased from around 22,000 at the beginning of January. Although all past posts have been deleted, the account itself still exists.  Like the company itself, Mt. Gox's Twitter feed was somewhat reluctant to disseminate useful information or engage in two-way communication. Many user support queries received automated responses (usually beginning with ""Dear Customer"") and sometimes weeks later. It has been silent throughout the company's recent issues with bitcoin withdrawals.  There have not been any official updates on Mt. Gox's support page or News section since 20th February, making customers increasingly nervous about the fate of their bitcoin wealth there. Mt. Gox bitcoins, which are still being actively traded, fell from around $300 at the start of 24th February (Japan time) to a low of $155 in the afternoon.  Motivation  With speculation already rampant that Mt. Gox is either insolvent or about to close its doors without reaching an acceptable solution, widespread skepticism met the deletions on forums like Reddit.  Some wondered if the company was preparing to rebrand itself in an attempt to regain trust, while others suggested removing public messages was for a small degree of legal protection in case customers decided to take action beyond office protests. A straw poll on the bitcointalk forum had 43% declaring Gox ""dead in the water"" and 23% expecting it to solve its problems and survive, with a minority of others expecting a major investor to step in and take over the company.  The notoriously secretive exchange may also just be following its long held pattern of falling silent in a crisis, due to legal concerns or what it regards as office security issues. It also announced it would be moving offices last week in response to recent events, without being clear as to why such action was necessary .  Until Mt. Gox makes another formal announcement or takes some other kind of definite action, however, all speculation must remain just that.

42425471,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwNh,1393221420,"Bitcoin Core Development Falling Behind, Warns Bitcoinj's Mike Hearn","Say what you like about Google, but it isn't an easy place to get hired at. The entrance interviews are notoriously tough, and it is a highly desired employer - which makes Mike Hearn's departure all the more notable.  Hearn is an expert in low-level software development, who worked as a site reliability engineer at Google, and focused on account security and antispam. He has also been one of the leading lights in the bitcoin community, heading up the open source development team for bitcoinj, which is the Java implementation of the bitcoin protocol.  He is leaving in part because of his growing interest in and commitment to bitcoin. Hearn sees a challenge ahead for the virtual currency: the core development team is shrinking.  Honey, I shrunk the team  ""The long tail has grown longer, but the heavy lifting and design work has been done by a handful of people. That's quite concerning,"" says Hearn, highlighting a few key players on the team. He uses the team's page on Github, the open source code repository on which Github is hosted, to see who's most heavily involved.  Gavin Andresen, the lead developer, is an obvious mainstay. Others include Philip Kaufmann, who does a lot of GUI development. Wladimir J. van der Laan also works on the front end.  ""There are occasional fixes and things submitted by other people, but the bulk of the work is being done by Gavin and those guys,"" says Hearn. ""I am a bit concerned by the fact that we don't have a lot of people turning up and doing really serious, useful work on the core.""  But then, that's a general problem with open source projects. Most people are not paid, meaning that participation can be patchy, and burnout rates can be high. Andresen is paid a salary by the Bitcoin Foundation, and Jeff Garzik, another programmer who has been heavily involved with core development, is in his first year at crypto currency payment processor BitPay, which has allowed him to focus at least partly on the protocol.  Quality, not quantity  Garzik says that Hearn has long been worried about team size, but says it's overemphasized. And statistics on Github may not be the easiest way to assess what's happening.  Open source projects are a question of quality, not quantity, says Garzik. For example, some of the most important features for bitcoin develop over months, meaning that their activity won't show up in the Git data.  He gives Gregory Maxwell as an example. Maxwell has 'commit access' on Github, which enables him to push in code changes.  ""In terms of code output, Greg has produced very little. A pull request here, a few lines change there,"" says Garzik. ""Counting Greg's commits or lines-of-code authored would rank him far below most other contributors, but we value his contributions very highly.""  Garzik has also been busy behind the scenes, he says, coding contributions outside the core bitcoin project.  But the fact still remains that bitcoin is going through a revolution. Engineers used to rule the bitcoin world, but since then, the money has moved in, and agendas have changed.  [post-quote]  Barry Silbert, head of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, has predicted that we are entering the third phase of development, with venture capital companies piling in. Institutional investors on Wall Street won't be far behind, he has said. With hundreds of millions of dollars now piling into the bitcoin economy, can the current development approach keep up?  It would help if some of them gave something back, complains Garzik. ""In general, I am disappointed at the large number of bitcoin companies that contribute nothing back to the original open source project, the software that runs the network we all use.  Last week, Gavin Andresen implied as much in a missive on the bitcoin mailing list, when he told companies using the bitcoin core not to treat the core development team ""as if we were a commercial company that sold you a software library”.  Hearn agrees, and adds that companies can fall foul of technical changes if they don't stay actively involved in helping with core development.  ""The fact that Gox was unaware of malleability entirely and then blamed the bitcoin software is perhaps a good example of a company that treated bitcoin as if it was a perfect black box, and became so disconnected they weren't even reading the mailing lists or release notes,"" he says.  Key developments  In the meantime, Hearn says, enhanced payments are one of the main thrusts for bitcoin development. This added feature, destined for the bitcoin client software rather than the core protocol, have been on the table for a while, but haven't yet made it into a release. They promise an easier way to make payments than dealing with long addresses, and they will also include support for memos.  Some people have also been working on subscription billing in the payment protocol, he says - this feature is badly needed in bitcoin. There has been some initial design work on this, which he would like to see turned into working code.  Smart transaction fees are also high on the agenda. Transaction fees today are not dynamic enough, he says. Instead, they are based on a set of arbitrary rules set by a core development team. This needs to be changed, (and is).  Smart fees are an attempt to make the fees float, and to formalise some of the rules about when fees are paid, explains Hearn.  ""It's not very dynamic today. It's just some magic numbers chosen by Gavin and so on. It's very inflexible. The bitcoin dollar price moves, but the fees don't. ""And the second problem is that it's centralized, because they're just some magic numbers chosen by the developers, which is not very feasible in the long run.""  This didn't make it into the latest version of the core protocol, however, which Hearn takes as another example of lag in a resource-constrained project, while the commercial bitcoin community powers ahead.  A new kind of wallet  There are other developments afoot in the bitcoin community, too. Hearn is busy implementing hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets in bitcoinj.  Traditionally, bitcoin wallets are designed to generate completely random addresses, encrypting the private keys for the user. These addresses are impossible to remember, and so the bitcoin wallet must be backed up frequently. Each backup includes all of the key pairs.  Instead, HD wallets use a single random number (also known as the extended address, or the seed), which can be written down as a series of twelve words. The wallet can then use a standard algorithm to derive many public keys from the seed, in the form of a tree.  ""The idea is that you can type in the same set of 12 words, and they will deliver the same sets of keys,"" says Hearn. ""With HD wallets, you can give me an extended address, and I can use that to derive fresh addresses. You only have to give me one piece of data, but I can generate new addresses from it each time.""  This carries several benefits, including the ability to share a wallet between different devices. The tree structure also allows the seed's owner to share some groups of addresses derived from the tree, but not others.  The HD wallet standard was finalized at the Bitcoin Conference last May, and Hearn hopes to have the bitcoinj integration completed in March. The mathematics are complete, he says. The tough part is integrating it into the bitcoinj software itself.  One of the challenges with HD wallets is privacy. Simply branching from an extended address means that anyone can iterate their way through all of the possible addresses in the tree, meaning that they could tell which payments had been made to or from any of them.  Hearn raises an alternative posited by Peter Todd, called stealth addresses. These allow you to distribute one address that can be used to generate new ones, but makes it impossible for people to make a connection between them.  ""It's not really clear to me that this is going to work in its current form because it's not really compatible with lightweight wallets, at least in the form that it's been proposed"" he says. However, it's still in the design stage, so this may change in the future.  Other developments include the use of the Tor network by default in bitcoinj. Traffic sent through Tor is encrypted most of the way. he would like to see this happen by the end of March, when he is back from his vacation.  When that vacation ends, Hearn has something else up his sleeve. He'll announce it shortly, and CoinDesk will be there to cover it.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/02/24/bitcoin-core-development-falling-behind-warns-bitcoinjs-mike-hearn,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/068db95843adb41c1524fe4a0e197ed3d11fdc6d-1000x700.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425472,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIDwPh,1393215251,Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles Resigns from Bitcoin Foundation Board,"Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles has resigned from his position as a board member with the Bitcoin Foundation.  The Foundation posted this announcement on its blog today at 3:30AM GMT:  ""Effective immediately, Mark Karpeles has submitted his resignation from the board of directors. We are grateful for his early and valuable contributions as a founding member in launching the Bitcoin Foundation.""  ""As CEO of MtGox Co. Ltd. (Japan), he held one of the three elected industry member seats. Further details, including election procedures, will be forthcoming.""  No updates, tweets gone  There has still been no notice since 20th February as to when and if Mt. Gox will resume bitcoin withdrawals for its users. While there were reports of tests and customers receiving withdrawals over the weekend, the company had not made any formal announcement on the issue at the time of writing.  In a move that may unsettle users, Mt. Gox has also deleted all posts from its official Twitter feed.  The price of bitcoin on Mt. Gox also rose from its sub-$100 level on Friday to more than $300 by the end of Sunday. It fell from around $250 to $220 in the hours after the announcement was posted.  Membership issues  Mt. Gox is also one of only two Bitcoin Foundation Gold Members, the second-highest tier of membership (Circle is the other Gold Member and BitcoinStore is a Platinum Member). Despite resigning from the board, Karpeles remains a Founding Member of the Foundation and Mt. Gox's industry membership is still valid. There have been no formal requests to remove these memberships.  There had been some hand-wringing at the Foundation and its online forums over what sort of action, if any, it should take against Karpeles and Mt. Gox, and there was also a petition at Change.org to remove Karpeles from his Board position.  Other senior Foundation members defended him as a Founding Member and Mt. Gox for its support of bitcoin over the years, saying neither should be removed forcibly but that Karpeles could always resign for personal reasons if he felt it necessary.  Still functioning  Neither Mt. Gox nor its management have been formally accused of any criminal activity, staff continue to work at the office daily and the company claims to be working hard to fix its technical problems.  Both have, however, come under strong criticism from several angles recently first for suspending withdrawals, then for damaging bitcoin's public image by blaming a long-known transaction malleability issue in the bitcoin protocol for the problem.  There has also been a general lack of communication with customers - many of whom have large sums of money locked in the exchange - and the value of bitcoin on other exchanges has fallen from over $930 on 11th January to less than $600 since Gox announced its ""temporary pause"" on 7th February.  Mt. Gox has long had issues with withdrawals for US-resident customers, a problem that was often blamed on banking issues and account seizures by US authorities.  This is the second time in recent months that a senior Bitcoin Foundation member and Board Member has resigned from the position under a cloud. BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem, who was the Board's vice chairman, also resigned in late January after his arrest over allegations of money laundering.
