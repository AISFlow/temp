42398797,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgc6S,1446066017,Microsoft Rolls Out Ethereum Toolkit for Business Users,"Computing giant Microsoft is rolling out a toolkit that will let its enterprise users build on the Ethereum protocol.  Thanks to a partnership with Ethereum collective ConsenSys, business users of Microsoft's cloud-based Azure service will be able to access Ethereum Blockchain-as-a-Service, or 'E BaaS'.  The sandbox initiative, announced today, will be unveiled on 10th November at Ethereum's DEVCON1 event in London.  Marley Gray, Microsoft's director of technology strategy for its US Financial Services, said in a statement:  ""Our enterprise clients will have the ability to deploy private and semi-private or consortium blockchain networks, as well as public Ethereum nodes with a single click on Azure.""  The company, which began accepting bitcoin for Xbox content in 2014, has shown increasing interest in blockchain technologies. In August, its director of technology and civic innovation, John Paul Farmer, told CoinDesk currencies were its ""least interesting"" application.  Through the toolkit, Microsoft's Azure users will be able to access tools such as BlockApps' full stack app and blockchain builder, Strato, and Ether.Camp, a blockchain explorer for Ethereum.  ""We’ll have developer tools and applications so [enterprises] can begin to understand the power behind blockchain technology,"" Gray said.  About ConsenSys  ConsenSys, headquartered in New York, is a collective building tools and DApps (decentralised apps) on Ethereum – which launched in ""bare bones"" form in July – to make the protocol user-friendly.  The brainchild of Ethereum Foundation co-founder Joseph Lubin, it emerged from stealth in August. More recently, it formed ConsenSys Enterprise for large-scale blockchain solutions.  While Azure customers will be able to fashion their own company-specific applications, DApps from ConsenSys range from EtherPoker and EtherSign (document signing) to HunchGame, which rewards users for accurately predicting celebrity gossip.  Andrew Keys, director of enterprise business development and communications at ConsenSys said:  ""We’ve found Azure to be an efﬁcient and powerful cloud to deploy our offerings and are looking forward to further collaboration with Microsoft. The initial offerings of BlockApps Strato and Ether.Camp will serve as foundational protocols and tools for developers to create blockchain applications immediately.""

42398799,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgc8Q,1446056913,NYDFS Chief to Resign Amid Reported Tension with Governor’s Office,"Infighting between the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and the state governor’s office has reportedly led to the resignation of key figures.  The Wall Street Journal  reported Monday that Anthony Albanese, acting superintendent of the NYDFS and successor to BitLicense architect Benjamin M Lawsky, is set to resign alongside agency spokesman Matthew Anderson. According to Bloomberg News, Albanese will depart in December.  Under Lawsky – who left office in June – the NYDFS developed the BitLicense, a licensure scheme for digital currency companies operating in the state of New York. As head of the NYDFS, Albanese has overseen the initial roll-out of the regulatory framework.  The driving force being the resignations, according to WSJ and Bloomberg sources, is alleged interference from the governor’s office into NYDFS activities.    The office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has reportedly tried to interfere with the NYDFS subpoena process by requiring that it be notified prior to subpoenas being issued – a charge the governor’s office has denied.    Contributing to the strain were reported conflicts over monetary penalties extracted by the NYDFS, which since its creation in 2011 has reaped billions of dollars in settlements from some of the city’s largest financial institutions. Some of those institutions, especially those headquartered overseas, are said to have complained about the fines to Cuomo’s office.  “Mr. Cuomo’s staff has sought in recent months to exert more control over the regulator, which has established itself as a powerful financial watchdog and brought billions of dollars in penalties to New York state’s general fund,” the Journal reported. “The regulator was also unpopular on Wall Street, where some executives felt the department at times overreached on Mr. Lawsky’s watch.”  Albanese said this week that the move out of NYDFS was always in the works, saying in a statement provided to Bloomberg:  “After four years at DFS, I decided it was time to return to the private sector and I have accepted another opportunity outside of government. This was always intended to be a temporary position to help smooth the transition process.”  Tug of war image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/10/28/nydfs-chief-to-resign-amid-reported-tension-with-governors-office,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e56d4205f9139d23f5a4cfd44ffb4a2e6042bdba-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42398793,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZfv,1446051601,Russian Minister Confirms Plans to Ban Bitcoin-to-Fiat Conversions,"Russia's Deputy Finance Minister has confirmed the country's plans to penalise the conversion of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin into the ruble.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Alexey Moiseev said a proposed draft law has been created and, if passed, would mean people engaging in crypto-to-fiat conversions would face up to four years in prison.  He explained:  ""It's true that we have developed draft law which provides up to four years in prison for some types of activities which relate to ... quasi-currencies. These types of activities are typically related to an exchange of those currencies into the Russian national currency – the ruble. This is the only type of activity which we propose to penalise with criminal sentences.""  Moiseev went on to say that, under the proposed law, people would not be penalised for mining cryptocurrencies or converting one cryptocurrency to another.  Bitcoin in Russia  The proposed law follows a Russian government official's public condemnation of payment company QIWI's plans to release its own digital currency – known as the bitruble.  Moiseev's comments also come after Vladimir Putin, the country's President, issued his first remarks on digital currencies in July.  Speaking during a TV broadcast, Putin said that, although the technology faced various challenges in terms of adoption, it could not be dismissed.  Prior to Putin's public address, reports about a possible bitcoin regulation meeting between Russia's central bank and representatives from the country's financial markets emerged in June.  Earlier this year, Liberal Democratic Party MP Andrei Svintsov contributed to bitcoin's rocky history in Russia, telling a national broadcaster that digital currencies such as bitcoin were a conspiracy created by US intelligence agencies.

42398789,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbgZew,1446021267,Bitcoin Price Hits $300 Amid Continuing Price Rally,"The price of bitcoin reached $300 today on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) for the first time in over three months, continuing a steady climb since mid-September.  The last time the bitcoin price surpassed $300 was on 13th July, when the price reached a high of $310.09, but closed on $290.88.  Today, the price exceeded this marker at around 02:30 UTC before continuing to rise to $301.96, but falling to $299.71 at the time of press.  While the price has increased 30.3% since the beginning of September, it is still considerably lower than it was throughout the same period of 2014.      Bitcoin Price Sept - Oct 2014/2015 Create line charts    The majority of trading in the past 24 hours occurred on Chinese bitcoin exchanges, with 45.18% taking place on OkCoin, 33.43% occurring on Huobi and 5.29% on BTCC, according to data from Bitcoinity. Volumes across the past 30 days tell a similar story.    Bitcoin volume Oct 27th    Create pie charts      The cause of the price increase isn't clear, although some speculate it is down to the recent EU value added tax (VAT) ruling, which recognised bitcoin as a currency and specified it is not subject to VAT. Others indicate Chinese traders fear further currency controls in their country, so are investing funds in bitcoin.
