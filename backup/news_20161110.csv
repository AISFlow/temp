42399486,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFGc,1478801267,Deutsche Bank: Capital Markets Expect Blockchain Impact Within 6 Years,"Three out of four capital markets participants now believe distributed ledger tech will see widespread use within the next six years, according to a new Deutsche Bank report.  Conducted on behalf of the bank's global transaction banking division, the report sought to examine the factors driving the strategic thinking of institutional investors, banks, financial sponsors, sovereign institutions and broker-dealers.  In total, 200 market participants were surveyed, with 87% reporting they believe it is likely to have an impact on securities services.  Overall, 75% of survey respondents see distributed technologies being widely used within the next three to six years, a finding the report authors suggested pointed to a ""surprising degree of certainty"" about the new technology.  Deborah Thompson, Deutsche Bank's head of Custody and Clearing, said in the report:  ""Respondents were clearly positive about the potential impact of blockchain — almost all participants saw it as either moderately or completely disruptive to existing business models — and an overwhelming majority believe it will be actively used within the next six years.""  Other notable findings included that most respondents believe the technology will help their firms reduce key costs.  Thirty-eight percent thought that blockchain could reduce the cost of providing securities services by more than 20%, though most (42%) estimated the savings would be in the 11% to 20% range.  Further, almost half (48%) said they believe that systems failures were the most important issue that blockchain could guard against.  The survey coincides with a larger exploration of blockchain by Deutsche Bank, which has in the past told CoinDesk it is involving its global transaction banking division in cross-company activities focused on the technology.  Deutsche Bank has also shown a willingness to partner with other major financial firms, teaming for a notable test on how banks could use digital currency to settle trades earlier this year.

42399479,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFBh,1478796335,How Two New Sidechains Proposals Could Change Bitcoin's DNA,"A long-proposed bitcoin feature called 'sidechains' may soon take a big step forward thanks to a pair of proposals.  The idea behind sidechains, most associated with the startup Blockstream (whose team boasts its originators), is to make it easier to add new features to bitcoin, something that's proven difficult in the past due to bitcoin's design.  In short, sidechains are supposed to make it possible for users to move bitcoins between different bitcoin-based blockchains with different rule sets. For example, in this way, new techniques for preserving the privacy of transactions or a smart contract system similar to ethereum's could be added to a bitcoin blockchain, without changing the bitcoin blockchain.  Bitcoin security consultant Sergio Demian Lerner, who is spearheading one effort to add sidechain functionality to bitcoin, explained that sidechains would broadly remove the difficulty developers today face in expanding bitcoin's capabilities.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Improving bitcoin the network has been compared to repairing a plane during flight.""  But in addition to Lerner's team, another group is working on proposals that could potentially put sidechains into the official bitcoin codebase.  In late September, Lerner revealed a proposal for code that could add this functionality to bitcoin, and Bloq economist Paul Sztorc told CoinDesk that he is working on code of his own.  Both are so-called ""drivechain"" proposals, a spin on sidechains first described by Sztorc last November. As such, each proposes a set of new features, called an opcode, that could potentially be added to bitcoin via a change known as a soft fork (an update that doesn't require all nodes to upgrade the software).  However, the two projects have different ideas about how to implement the opcode and don't plan to join forces on one proposal (at least not yet).  Two approaches  In a transfer between sidechains, bitcoins are sent from one blockchain to another, or that's what it looks like.  But in reality, bitcoins from one chain (say bitcoin) are locked on the main bitcoin blockchain, while they're simultaneously unlocked on the sidechain that they're being ""transferred"" to.  The key difference between drivechains and regular sidechains is who ultimately submits the necessary information to transfer the bitcoins back and forth: the users or the miners.  Lerner's version of drivechain relies on miners to be ""algorithmic proxy custodians,"" or programs that help make miners aware of other sidechains attached to the network.  ""Bitcoin miners observe the state of the sidechain and when they receive a command from the sidechain having proven consent (eg a hundred confirmations), they execute a coordination protocol to make sure they all agree on the authenticity of the command,"" Lerner explained.  He added: ""If they agree, they will make a payment using locked funds.""  Lerner's proposal introduces a new bitcoin script called OP_COUNT_ACKS, which implements the above drivechain functionality (bitcoin scripts are like smart contracts) in about 600 lines of code, in what he called a small change.  Lerner also noted that Segregated Witness, the newest major change to bitcoin, once triggered, could help with this. The code was officially added to bitcoin earlier this month, and the change could be activated by miners as early as this December.  While it's widely seen as a scaling solution, it comes with other benefits.  ""SegWit provides a new system for easy soft-forking: the witness script versioning system. Our BIP uses this system to add a new opcode without the limitations of the previous soft-forking system,"" Lerner explained.  Separate attempts  Sztorc is working on similar code that has yet to be publicized.  But while Sztorc and Lerner have discussed and collaborated, each seems to think that their own project is best and wants to continue pursuing them separately.  Sztorc's main critique with Lerner's implementation is that it's using the sidechain from another one of his efforts, Rootstock, which features ethereum-style smart contracts, rather than a copy of bitcoin.  ""Drivechain is a new idea. So it's a risk as it is. I don't like the idea of compounding that by doing two new ideas at once,"" Sztorc said.  Other differences are smaller details, Sztorc noted, using the invention of a hammer as an analogy. Say someone invents a hammer, a tool that never existed before, but they are debating whether the hammer should be built out of stone or wood.  If accepted, either could eventually make its way into bitcoin in the form of a soft fork.  Dangerous potential  But again, we're talking about an update that developers compare to an in-flight airplane fix.  Sidechains may be a proposal that's supposed to help with this problem, but to first add this functionality to bitcoin, it needs to pass this hurdle as other optimizations and additions, such as SegWit, have.  Blockstream core tech engineer Russell O'Connor described some potential problems with Lerner's proposed opcode that boil down to the opcode depending on data values that are specific to the block that a transaction is added to.  He explained that other opcodes that have been recently added to Bitcoin Core ""were carefully constructed to ensure this property.""  Also of note is that there might not have been full discussion of the proposal yet. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd declined to discuss the new drivechain opcode because of Lerner's past bitcoin-related patents, and said that he will reject the proposal ""until this is rectified.""  Lerner responded that he has no plans to patent drivechain. Further, he said other bitcoin protocol developers, including Matt Corallo and Pieter Wiulle, are open to discussing the change.  When asked about his patent strategy, Sztorc said he has ""absolutely zero intent"" on a patent, even a defensive one.  Besides these specific criticisms, there's plenty of skepticism to go around to every sidechain project, with accompanying discussion about the security of each. Some long-standing criticisms boil down to whether or not sidechains are viable at all.  ""The main discussion relates to the effects of putting more power in the hands of the miners and what are the long-term consequences. More specifically, the question is what would happen if a bitcoin sidechain grows so popular that [miners mining both bitcoin and the popular sidechain] need to run higher-end computers, outcompeting solo miners,"" Lerner explained.  But Sztorc seemed optimistic despite the criticism, some of which he plans to address in a ""very long"" blog post in the coming weeks.  ""The philosophy is mostly done and the code is mostly done. We're both really close,"" he said.  Lerner concluded much the same, adding:  ""We're are very enthusiastic this could happen as soon as 2017.""

42399492,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFKY,1478785819,Hyperledger's Next Act: A Blockchain Bridge to China,"If blockchain is done right, borders will begin to disappear.  Immutable, shared ledgers of transactions and goods could come to serve as a reminder that everything we grow, build, buy and sell comes from the same tiny planet.  But this future is far from guaranteed, and the various blockchain developer groups competing to bring it to life have so far struggled to involve talent from all over the world in this global vision.  Blockchain consortium Hyperledger, for example, was initially founded with support from companies in almost exclusively Western nations. Yet, the consortium has grown this year to include more than 20 members headquartered in China and 10 from Japan and South Korea, with a spattering of members from other nations represented as well.  With that success, Hyperledger executive director Brian Behlendorf has faced a new challenge, creating a system that allows information to flow between its multilingual members as seamlessly as data on a blockchain.  The answer, he hopes, is called the Technical Working Group China, and if a proposal he is currently writing is accepted by the members, it could help bridge multiple cultural gaps around the world.  Behlendorf said:  ""If we build these systems right, they can help us cross-borders and using a common technology platform to do that helps us get there faster.""  The trick Behlendorf will try to navigate is to create a community that strengthens the Chinese firms' sense of belonging by making it easier for them to connect, without accidentally turning that bridge into a barrier between them and other members.  Of the companies now headquartered in China, several are startups that specialize in blockchain. But two recent members are also the largest.  The privately held Shenzhen-based electronics firm Huawei joined in October after generating $60bn in revenue last year. Further, in September, another privately held firm, Beijing-based Wanda Group, became Hyperledger’s first China-based premier member after generatinghttp://www.wanda-group.com/corporateprofile/ an annual income of $38.8bn.  In theory, the more companies that participate, the greater the network effect each would enjoy.  Blockchain China  While Hyperledger's China contingent has grown, it is not alone.  Nationally, Chinese investors and financial institutions have moved this year to embrace blockchain, even as the government sends mixed signals.  On 11th May, Chinese firms joined together to form the ChinaLedger Alliance, and by the end of that month, 31 firms had partnered to create the Financial Blockchain Shenzhen Consortium. Both groups were designed to help China reap greater rewards from blockchain efficiencies.  Then, days after the launch of the Shenzhen group, Shenzhen-based Ping An became the first financial institution in China to join New York-based R3CEV blockchain consortium.  But the push to build a financial infrastructure that crosses borders also includes work with business on public blockchains.  Less than a month later, blockchain startup Circle announced a $60m Series D investment led by Beijing-based IDG Capital. The investment was positioned as a way to expand the company's efforts into China.  The proposal  It was against that backdrop that Hyperledger's executive director sent the first email proposing what he dubbed, the Technical Working Group China.  On 26th October, Behlendorf wrote that the formation of the group could serve as ""a bridge"" between the global Hyperledger community and the greater China region.  Reaction to the proposal has been positive, Behlendorf said.  In a technical steering committee meeting last Thursday, he further advanced the idea, explaining that the group should consist of 11 people including co-chairs who might take turns attending the English-language technical steering committee meetings.  If the proposal is passed, the co-chairs will likely be comprised of volunteers, he said. A member of the Technical Steering Committee from Huawei volunteered himself in a public listserv to help bridge the gap between the communities and help bridge language barriers.  ""It's not just about asking questions and getting support, it's got to be about helping those developers become actual contributors to the project,"" Behlendorf told CoinDesk. ""What we get in terms of intellectual property contributed will more than pay off.""  More than language  Of course, it's not just language that separates some of the Chinese members of Hyperledger from other members of the community. There’s a lot of distance too.  Another member of Huawei spoke up in perfect English during the meeting last week to say he didn’t think language would be nearly as big an issue as the time-zone differences.  Another possibility currently being discussed is a rotating presence of various chairs on the weekly Technical Steering Committee call.  Already, product manager Zhibei Yu of Hyperledger member, Yunphan Group, confirmed to CoinDesk the firm intends to volunteer to participate, calling the working group a ""brilliant idea.""  The founder and CEO of early Hyperledger member, Shanghai-based Bitse, says his company hasn't experienced issues with collaborating across borders. But nevertheless, sees value in the initiative.  DJ Qian told CoinDesk the group would be especially beneficial as a way to integrate new members to Hyperledger's own unique multinational culture.  ""We think this will be an excellent onboarding tool for the new Chinese members,"" said Qian. ""This will help accelerate the progress of this global blockchain effort.""  Feet on the ground  Currently, Hyperledger’s executive director is writing up a formal proposal which he intends to present to the group today for a formal vote.  If all goes well, the group should be formed in time for Hyperledger's first China hackathon, tentatively planned for 7th and 8th January 2017.  One of the hackathon organizers from Wanda Financial Group, also addressed the group during the meeting. He said he expects ""every member"" will participate in the hackathon.  Now, an unnamed company that specializes in helping foreign companies find professionals in China is working with a recently hired Hyperledger sales and accounting manager to help expand the consortium's presence.  Behlendorf concluded:  ""We see that team growing.""

42399473,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjF6m,1478783891,Russia's Central Securities Depository Tests Blockchain Assets Exchange,"Russia's central securities depository (CSD) is working with a tech startup to test the exchange and transfer of blockchain assets.  The project is part of a broader fintech initiative conducted in partnership between the Russian National Settlement Depository (NSD) and the National Research University's Higher School of Economics. A total of 10 startups took part. NSD is working with a startup called iCoinSoft, which according to its website designs white label exchange software for cryptocurrencies.  NSD said today that it was experimenting with ""the circulation of blockchain assets"" and that it had already begun working in tandem with clients on the potential application.  The firm explained:  ""NSD experts and the project’s team have prepared a boxed solution which supports any existing and developing assets, including more than 500 existing as of today. The iCoinSoft Exchange Platform reduces the time required to enter the market by a new platform to two weeks, and two clients have already proven it in practice.""  The test is the latest for the NSD, which has to date taken a proactive approach to testing blockchain.  Earlier this year, the firm announced that it was undertaking trials of blockchain voting sytems in a bid to improve transparency. In September, it announced that it was working with Strate, South Africa's CSD, on a number of projects.

42399481,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbjFCg,1478780215,Trump Election Casts Uncertain Shadow on US Blockchain Policy,"President-elect Donald Trump's victory has shaken the US political landscape, but what does that mean for blockchain policy?  By all accounts, Trump scored a stunning upset in yesterday's US presidential vote, following a chaotic and controversial campaign. And though Trump and his campaign didn't weigh in on FinTech during the election, the future president will be the one to ultimately sign any legislation that would capture bitcoin and blockchain technology.  Still, Trump offered peeks into his regulatory agenda over the course of the race. For example, he has expressed support for repealing the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill – a move that, if successful, could eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and any in-development bitcoin regulations along with it.  That said, the unpredictable president-elect might prove to be just that when sworn into office next January, meaning that it's tough to say how things will turn out, or whether it will impact the support growing in Washington for some kind of action on the technology.  When reached for comment about the outcome and its impact on their work, Coin Center and the Chamber of Digital Commerce – the two leading public policy groups focused on issues related to the tech – said they intend to keep working with the new administration.  Chamber president Perianne Boring struck a bullish tone, issuing her belief that Trump is likely to avoid ""heavy-handed, redundant or superfluous regulation"", a position he would share with the Republican-controlled Congress.  Boring told CoinDesk:  ""The Trump administration is highly likely to produce a sensible regulatory climate to allow the blockchain and digital asset space to flourish at its full, amazing potential.""  The comments point to the continued industry dissatisfaction with past legislative attempts, such as New York's BitLicense, which have long been critiqued by technologists as overly expansive.  Yet, there was a feeling that general education on the technology is still lacking.  Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito predicted that work on outreach might take new meaning in light of a Trump presidency.  ""There are champions and skeptics of cryptocurrencies on both sides of the aisle,"" he said. ""What an unexpected new administration means, though, is that we've got a lot of educating to do about the technology and smart policy approaches to it.""  Lower priority  At least one observer says that, regardless of the environment in Washington next year, a Trump administration is unlikely to make bitcoin or blockchain a legislative or regulatory priority.  Carol Van Cleef, a former partner for Manatt, Phelps & Phillips who recently joined BakerHostetler to continue her work on cryptocurrency and blockchain, said simply that Trump would likely have bigger priorities.  ""I am guessing first and foremost, this is going to be sufficiently down on the list of things to do, with the repeal of Obamacare, Dodd Frank and much more in line ahead,"" she said.  Van Cleef went on to speculate that Republicans may avoid significant action on blockchain or financial technology entirely, leaving the states to fill the gap.  ""We cannot overlook the fact that the states still play a very significant role in this area and it is highly unlikely there will be any actions (ie a federal preemption) taken to disrupt the roles of the states,"" she said.  She noted this would be especially unlikely following given the historical positions of the Republican party on regulation.  Michael del Castillo contributed reporting.
