Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike Sławomir Mentzen, a Polish politician and chair of the New Hope Party, has recently announced a campaign promise to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve for Poland. Mentzen unveiled his proposal via Twitter/X, adding that “there’s no reason to wait,” referring to his country’s potential Bitcoin cache. According to some reports, Mentzen is also invested in Bitcoin, with a holding of 33.7 BTC, or roughly $3 million, based on the current market price. 🇵🇱 Poland’s presidential candidate recently vowed to create a strategic #Bitcoin reserve if he wins the election, following Donald Trump’s lead. The move could be a huge change in crypto adoption for Poland.#Crypto adoption is growing rapidly—don’t miss this opportunity. Now is… pic.twitter.com/2cD86nS1hq — The Times of PiNetwork (@PiNetwork24X7) November 17, 2024 It’s About Time For Poland’s Crypto Reserve – Mentzen Mentzen’s comment stemmed from a Twitter/X user asking him if he’d consider a strategic BTC reserve for Poland. The Polish presidential candidate answered in the affirmative, saying it was about time the country adopted this policy. He added that there’s a bill for a strategic reserve for the top asset, and there’s no time to wait. Mentzen further argued that a strategic stockpile must be passed instead of other ordinary crypto laws. The social media user is referring to the “Satoshi Action Fund,” a bill filed by a non-profit organization. The same lobby organization headed by Dennis Porter also helped draft a similar bill for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. Can Poland Follow The US Bitcoin Experience? Although Bitcoin has become an election issue, whether Poland will join the Bitcoin bandwagon remains to be seen. Poland is not part of the European Union and uses a separate currency, the zloty. Also, Mentzen’s party boasts far-right policies but has limited influence in Polish politics. The Konfederacja party alliance nominated Mentzen for next year’s presidential elections, but it’s unlikely that he’ll win with limited support from a small party. However, as a presidential candidate and a member of the Polish Sejma, one of the two chambers in the country’s parliament, many believe the Bitcoin proposal will get some attention. Related Reading: Mantra (OM) Hits New ATH On 132% Weekly Surge – Details Mentzen’s Support Of Bitcoin Gets Traction Mentzen’s social media post immediately garnered attention among observers and analysts. The politician even reposted his tweet and added another post sharing that he will ensure a friendly regulatory environment for cryptocurrency once he becomes the country’s president. Today, election observers and market analysts are examining the possible role of Bitcoin in Mentzen’s campaign. Some are already asking if his pro-BTC stance can help sway public opinion and votes, even if he’s with a small party.

Kraken, the second-largest crypto exchange in the U.S., filed a motion for interlocutory appeal (a type of appeal that challenges a judge’s non-final decision while allowing other aspects of a case to move forward) in September, a month after Judge William Orrick of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled that the SEC had plausibly alleged that the cryptocurrencies sold on Kraken’s platform may be securities under the Howey Test.  In their September motion, Kraken’s lawyers argued that Orrick should grant them permission to appeal his decision with a higher court, arguing that Orrick’s order “involve[d] a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion” and that “an immediate appeal…may materially advance the termination of the litigation.”  But Orrick was unmoved, testily reminding Kraken’s lawyers in his Monday ruling that allowing a motion for interlocutory appeal is “entirely discretionary” and rejecting their hypothesis that an appeal could speed up the case.  “Fundamentally, I do not believe that certification will materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,” Orrick wrote. “While the SEC has plausibly alleged its theory of securities violations against Kraken, only discovery will establish whether the sales, trades, and exchanges on Kraken truly met all the Howey elements… A complete record is necessary to answer those questions. Certification at this stage would only delay resolution.”  The SEC sued Kraken last November for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, dealer, and clearinghouse, and requesting disgorgement and civil penalties as well as permanent injunctions for the crypto exchange.

Trump Sets Sights On Crypto Expansion According to sources familiar with the ongoing discussions, TMTG is considering an all-share purchase of Bakkt, although the exact valuation remains unclear. As of Monday, Bakkt’s market capitalization was just over $150 million. Related Reading: The Year Of Solana: 2024 Sees Global Crypto Love Surge Nearly 40% TMTG, which Trump has pledged to maintain a 53% stake in, has gained considerable attention in the stock market since the former president’s election victory on November 5. Despite reporting only $2.6 million in revenues this year, TMTG boasts an equity valuation of $6 billion, providing it with a robust currency for potential acquisitions. Following the announcement of the acquisition talks, Bakkt’s shares jumped 86%, reflecting investors’ optimism about the potential acquisition. TMTG’s share price also rose significantly by around 14%. TMTG Explores All-Share Purchase Of Bakkt Founded by ICE, Bakkt was initially designed to facilitate a range of crypto services, including a custody business aimed at holding the industry’s leading digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), for clients. However, this part of the crypto business has struggled, with reported operating losses of $27,000 against revenues of only $328,000 for the third quarter of the year. Consequently, it is expected that TMTG’s acquisition will not include Bakkt’s custody operations, which are likely to be phased out.

36527608,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653664,1731965401,"Analyst Says XRP’s 11-Year SuperCycle Is Coming To An End, Why A Surge To $3.4 Is Imminent","A crypto analyst has noted that XRP has finally broken out of its long consolidation phase, signaling the onset of a major price rally. He further predicts that the XRP price is on the verge of ending an 11-year SuperCycle, which could pave the way for a surge to $3.4 once finalized. SuperCycle To Trigger $3.4 Surge Skyrexio, a TradingView crypto analyst, has released an XRP price analysis, forecasting a possible increase to $3.4. In the chart analysis, Skyrexio disclosed that XRP has recently broken out of its four-year consolidation period, potentially signaling the start of a bullish uptrend. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $1 Billion Exchange Outflow Alongside Bitcoin: What This Means For Price Unsurprisingly, the total duration of the consolidation period coincides with the number of years XRP has been involved in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Following the lawsuit, the XRP price crashed significantly, staying range-bound for years as it struggled with legal and regulatory challenges. Notably, Skyrexio’s bullish forecast for the XRP price relies on the Elliott Wave Theory, a technical indicator that predicts price movements of an asset by identifying recurrent long-term price patterns. The analyst noted that XRP’s first Elliott Wave began in 2013, almost 11 years ago. After that, the cryptocurrency experienced a price correction, followed by the legendary Wave 3. Over the last three years, the price of XRP had been trading sideways, failing to experience gains that would push its price significantly above the $0.5 mark. Skyrexio has revealed that this prolonged sideways movement can be interpreted as a corrective triangle pattern in Wave 4. The analyst revealed that XRP has successfully broken out of this triangle pattern, signaling the end of its correction phase. He suggests that the cryptocurrency is now in Wave 5, the last wave of its first global SuperCycle. Based on XRP’s Elliott Wave analysis, Skyrexio has outlined two bullish targets for the XRP price. The analyst forecasts that XRP could rise between $2.5 and $3.8 at the end of this SuperCycle. He emphasized that the higher price target at $3.8 is more likely to be achieved, as historical data shows that in 90% of cases, Wave 5 experiences a higher high than Wave 3. Concluding his analysis, Skyrexio pointed out key bullish indicators on his price chart, including a bullish reversal bar and green dot at the end of Subway C. He suggested that these bullish signs, appearing on the monthly time frame, are strong indicators of a potential upward move that could drive the XRP price to its final bullish target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Golden Multiplier Ratio: Analyst Says The Party Is Just Getting Started Update On XRP Price Dynamics The XRP price has achieved a monumental milestone for the first time in years. In just one week, the cryptocurrency rallied by 101.77%, experiencing significant price gains following Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential elections this month. Earlier this year, the price of XRP was stuck in the $0.5 range, experiencing slight gains but unable to break past this critical resistance level. Now, the cryptocurrency has doubled its price and is trading above $1, a historic feat that has caught the attention of the broader crypto community. As of writing, XRP has gained another 10.1% and is priced at $1.16, according to CoinMarketCap.

The U.S. SEC approved options for the spot bitcoin ETFs on several exchanges in September.  Options on the other spot products could also become available in the next couple of days.  Options trading on spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) — a long-awaited tool that market participants believe will lure more institutional interest to crypto — could become available as soon as Tuesday, according to Nasdaq.  “Our intent at Nasdaq is to list and trade these options as early as tomorrow,” Alison Hennessy, head of ETP listings at Nasdaq, told Bloomberg TV. “Getting these options listed on IBIT into the market I think will be very exciting for investors because that’s really what we have heard from them.”  While there are currently eleven U.S.-based spot bitcoin ETFs on the market, only one of them, BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), is listed on Nasdaq and could therefore have options available.  Options are a form of derivative that allow investors to purchase or sell an underlying asset —IBIT in this case — at a predetermined price within a specified period. They are particularly attractive to traders because they allow them to not just make leveraged directional bets, but to hedge other positions.  The SEC approved the listing of options for IBIT in September. It also approved the rule changes filed by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Cboe Global Markets, which list some of the other spot bitcoin ETFs.  As for the other bitcoin ETFs, options on those could start trading within the next few days as well, said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.  “It’s likely that these things start trading this week, potentially within the next day or two"" he said. ""As far as we can tell, all of the regulatory and bureaucratic hurdles have been cleared. It’s just a matter of crossing t’s and dotting i’s.""

42415498,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgUc,1731962381,Can a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Move Forward Without Congress? Experts Disagree,"Then-candidate Donald Trump promised to stop selling seized bitcoin back in July.  Experts tell CoinDesk that the incoming president might need help from Congress to establish a proper strategic reserve.  While Republicans will soon have majorities in Congress, spinning up a bitcoin reserve won’t be high on their list of priorities.  Will the U.S. government actually establish a bitcoin {{BTC}} reserve? It seems to depend on the definition of “reserve” you use.  Would the government simply stop selling the bitcoin in its possession, as former President and now President-elect Donald Trump promised in his Nashville speech this summer? Or would it actively purchase bitcoin, as per the wishes of Senator Cynthia Lummis and Trump ally Robert F. Kennedy?  The government currently holds 208,109 bitcoin — worth over $19 billion — per Arkham Intelligence. That stockpile was acquired over time through confiscations related to criminal activities. Historically, the government has sold this seized bitcoin in auctions, but Trump announced in July that under his administration, the government would keep 100% of all the bitcoin it currently holds or acquires in the future.  It might sound like a simple policy, but there isn’t any established method to implement it, and the procedure would likely involve the coordination of various government agencies like the Department of Justice, the U.S. Marshals Services and the U.S. Treasury.  “We don't have anything in writing, right? We’re just kind of going by a speech that was rather generic,” Perianne Boring, founder and CEO of crypto advocacy group The Digital Chamber, told CoinDesk. “Can you just move money between the federal agencies like that? I don't know.”  “If you're moving [bitcoin] out of the Department of Justice to the Treasury, and it's like a strategic Bitcoin stockpile fund, that likely requires an act of Congress,” Boring added. “But again, I don't know exactly how much [Trump] can do with his executive powers.”  Moish Peltz, a partner at Falcon, Rappaport and Berkman, told CoinDesk that the rules surrounding seized bitcoin might change on a department-by-department basis and vary depending on how the bitcoin was seized in the first place. “Some portion of the seized bitcoin might need an act of Congress, but not necessarily,” he said.  Moreover, the process could be gradual. “[The government’s] existing experience with the seizure and custody of large amounts of Bitcoin demonstrates competency and makes it easy to imagine from a technical perspective a relatively low level of difficulty in establishing a strategic reserve,” Peltz said. “Over time, this could evolve into a more significant stance as regulatory clarity improves, legislation is enacted (and implemented), and the government develops a more comprehensive digital asset strategy.”  Purchasing more bitcoin  Keeping seized bitcoin is one vision for the reserve. But Senator Lummis has argued for a more proactive approach in a new bill: for the U.S. to sell off a portion of its gold reserves and buy 1 million bitcoin. At current prices, that would entail spending a minimum of $90 billion for the acquisition, though the government would likely be front-ran if the bill ever passes.  “An executive order could also potentially initiate the process, but substantial financial commitments usually require an act of Congress to allocate funds and create a legal framework,” Peltz said.  Boring was optimistic about the bill passing. With Republicans soon to be in control of the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House, “it's absolutely possible to get it done,” she said, while noting that it was unlikely for the bill to go through the new Congress in the first 100 days.  But Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund, wasn’t so sure. Congressional priorities when it comes to crypto involve passing a stablecoin bill and investigating Operation Choke Point 2.0, Carter posted last week after meeting with members of Congress and the Federal Reserve. The strategic reserve “didn’t come up in any of the convos I had,” he posted on X.  So could there be a legal loophole that allows the government to purchase bitcoin without Congressional approval? Maybe. Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, argued last week in favor of a novel and untested theory: that the Treasury has the authority to acquire bitcoin through the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF) by purchasing bitcoin-denominated debt instruments.  “Upon maturity, the counterparty would repay the debt obligation in bitcoin, transferring the cryptocurrency to the Treasury,” Shapiro wrote. “This mechanism allows the Treasury to acquire bitcoin without directly purchasing it on the open market, thus avoiding potential market disruptions or price spikes that could result from large direct purchases.”  Bettors on Polymarket currently give 30% odds for the government to hold bitcoin reserves between January and April 2025.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/11/18/can-a-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-move-forward-without-congress-experts-disagree,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dff3e87eb0508dd2635742134cc7233efc8c5761-2000x1333.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike The virtual coin outperformed some of the well-known cryptocurrencies in the market, an indicator of the crypto’s growing appeal to investors worldwide. Solana Bags No. 1 Spot Solana seized the top spot in the ranking of blockchain ecosystems in the crypto space. This is an important feat that shows the capability of the coin to dominate the digital currency market. CoinGecko revealed that from January 1 to November 11, 2024, the global traffic share of Solana has outdone its fellow cryptos, saying that SOL holds nearly 39% of all investor interests worldwide. SOL’s global shares are more than twice the share of Base, which occupies second place with 16.81%, showing its commanding lead among blockchain ecosystems. CoinGecko attributed the SOL’s prominence to the Pump.fun platform, which Solana launched in January this year. The platform played a crucial role in sparking the interest in SOL. The crypto market analyst added that Solana’s “speed and low gas fees” were also major contributors to its popularity among investors. Meanwhile, the data aggregator website noted that although Solana led the top of the blockchain ecosystems ranking, the coin’s share of investor interest has decreased by 10.5%. In contrast, other ecosystems have gone up to get more global shares. The Pump.fun Effect Analysts said that one of the major drivers in the huge interest in SOL is the Pump.fun. Solana introduced the new platform in January, boosting the coin’s customer engagement and leading to more interest in it. Solana boasted that Pump.fun is viewed as its “fastest trading terminal,” which can also be used for “non-custodial wallet creation through emails.” Data showed that over 2.5 million tokens have been deployed with the use of the platform, noting that Pump.fun has become famous in the meme coin community for its low transaction costs. Related Reading: Mantra (OM) Hits New ATH On 132% Weekly Surge – Details ETF Listing By 2025 Matthew Sigel, head of digital asset research at VanEck, believed that Solana could get an ETF listing by 2025, showing confidence that SOL will get US approval next year. Sigel said that the odds are in favor of Solana, saying that an ETF listing by 2025 is “overwhelmingly high.” He suggested that US President-elect Donald Trump’s stance on cryptocurrencies could be a deciding factor in SOL’s campaign for an ETF listing since Trump projects a more friendly approach to cryptocurrencies. As of writing, SOL is being traded at $244 per coin and has a total market capitalization of more than $114 billion.

42415492,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgS6,1731956399,Bitfinex Hack Launderer Heather 'Razzlekhan' Morgan Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan, who helped launder the proceeds of the 2016 Bitfinex hack led by husband Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison in the incident that drained almost 120,000 bitcoin from the exchange.  Her husband, who'd conducted the 2016 hack, was sentenced to five years last week for his role in the crime. The couple later laundered as much as a fifth of the ill-gotten bitcoin, according to authorities. Prosecutors had recommended an 18-month sentence for Morgan, who is widely known by her former rapping name, Razzlekahn.  “I am extremely sorry and deeply regret the choices I made,"" Morgan said in a tearful statement she made during a sentencing hearing on Monday. ""I used my time and energy to do harm instead of good, and I’m ashamed of that.”  Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia said Morgan's actions were deliberate and involved ""extensive planning"" during the hearing.  ""These are serious offenses,” the judge said. ""You were true partners in this laundering scheme … You did not stop voluntarily but stopped when you got arrested.”  The couple was arrested in February of 2022. Lichtenstein eventually admitted to orchestrating the theft, and Morgan also pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States.  Morgan asserted that she wasn't aware of the theft until after it had happened. But she was accused by authorities of helping using complex methods to try to conceal the sources of the cashed-out tokens, including depositing funds into darknet markets, ""chain hopping"" in converting the assets to other tokens, sending it through cryptocurrency mixing services, exchanging some of the assets into gold coins and using U.S. business banking accounts to seek to legitimize the money.  Her parents and friends from as far as Dubai and Hong Kong awaited her sentencing in the Washington courtroom on Monday. Many of them had made a case for leniency with the judge, who acknowledged Morgan had a lot of support and was a relatively minor and remorseful player in the Bitfinex crimes. But the judge said she had to be conscious of the sentence as a deterrent in a crypto sector that's seen a lot of criminality.  Morgan's lawyer said his client has had her reputation ""completely and utterly"" destroyed in the past couple of years, largely due to the public's interest in her rapper persona that he dismissed as her ""playing a character."" He asked that her punishment be limited to the 17 days she served in jail and the home confinement she's lived under since then.  But the prosecution noted how deeply involved she was in seeking to conceal and use the millions her husband stole, sharing examples of her subterfuge, including personally burying gold coins acquired with the cryptocurrency.  ""She was the one that dug the hole,"" a lawyer for the prosecution said. ""She jumped into the conspiracy.""  Morgan wept as she expressed remorse for her part.  ""The harm I've caused will haunt me for the rest of my life,"" she said.  Hours later, she posted a video on X saying she'd been silent while the criminal case was working through the courts, but she'll soon be telling more of her story. ""Razzle Dazzle!"" she closed the video, jumping back into her Razzlekahn persona.  The judge gave her until at least the end of January before she'll have to report to prison, though no date has yet been set.  Cheyenne Ligon contributed reporting.

Kalshi is currently locked in a legal battle with the CFTC, which, last September, attempted to block the prediction market from listing certain event contracts that allowed traders to bet on which political party would control the House or Senate after the November elections. The regulator argued that Kalshi’s proposed contracts involved “gaming” and “activity that is unlawful under state law” and were therefore “contrary to the public interest.”  Kalshi then sued the CFTC in the District of Columbia, alleging that the agency exceeded its statutory authority and violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) when it tried to ban election prediction markets.  The CFTC, Kalshi argued in its most recent filing, “concoct[ed] a Goldilocks definition of ‘gaming’ that reaches bets on ‘contests’ (including elections) but no other contingent events — is arbitrary, outcome-driven gerrymandering with no basis in statute.”  The District Court sided with Kalshi — Judge Jia Cobb granted Kalshi summary judgment, rejecting the CFTC’s interpretation of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) as “much too broad” and vacating the CFTC’s order blocking Kalshi’s contracts.  After Cobb issued her decision, the CFTC requested that she stay her order while they appealed it. Cobb declined to do so. When the regulator then asked a U.S. federal appeals court to temporarily block the election-related events contracts, the appeals court also declined, issuing a unanimous decision denying the CFTC’s emergency motion to stay and arguing that the CFTC had provided “no concrete basis” to conclude that election contracts could harm the public interest.  Now, the CFTC is officially appealing Cobb’s ruling. The appeal comes as the regulator is attempting to broaden the definition of gaming to include “political contests” – if passed, this would effectively ban election betting.  In its brief filed Friday, Kalshi reiterated its arguments made to the lower court and asked that the appellate court should affirm Cobb’s ruling.  “In short, the Commission’s decision to prohibit Kalshi’s contracts exceeded its statutory authority. Congress is free to add “elections” to the [Commodity Exchange Act’s] list of enumerated activities, and thereby authorize the CFTC to prohibit election prediction markets. But Congress has not done so. This Court should therefore affirm the District Court’s judgment,” Kalshi’s lawyers argued.

36520912,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653685,1731954643,Crypto Analyst Unveils List Of Top Memecoins To Buy Now,"In his latest YouTube video titled “Turn $1,000 into $100,000 With Meme Coins in 45 Days! [I’m Buying These Memes Now],” Miles Deutscher provides an analysis of the current memecoin landscape where he lists specific coins that he believes are poised for substantial growth. Deutscher contextualized the current market environment, stating, “altcoins are now breaking out of a key resistance level on the weekly, absolutely flying specifically the meme coins.” He attributes this surge to the memecoin supercycle, driven by increased retail participation and strategic exchange listings. “The altcoins that people are bidding in light of this breakout are the memecoins, specifically the ones that are getting exchange listings,” he explains. List Of Deutscher’s Top Memecoins To Buy Now Among the top memecoins Deutscher highlights, Pepe (PEPE) is a standout performer. “Pepe is my first 100x through memecoins,” Deutscher exclaims. He advises a proactive trading approach, utilizing technical indicators to navigate its price movements. “Pepe continues to show strong bullish signals, making it a prime candidate for long-term holds and active trading,” he asserts. Related Reading: Uncertainty Looms For Crypto As SEC And CFTC Leadership Transitions Unfold Under Trump Dogwifhat (WIF) is another memecoin that Deutscher identifies as having significant upside potential. “WIF is performing exceptionally well right now,” he notes, pointing to its strong market performance. Deutscher recommends monitoring breakout patterns and technical signals akin to those observed with Pepe, suggesting that WIF is well-positioned to capitalize on the ongoing market momentum. “Watch for breakout patterns and technical signals similar to Pepe,” he states. Foxy (FOXY) also garners attention for its remarkable performance, currently up approximately 110% in the last 13 days. “Foxy has started flying the spell call from yesterday,” Deutscher states. He recommends a strategic approach of taking partial profits while maintaining the majority of the position to maximize returns. “Targeting higher range highs with potential for yearly high retests,” he explains. Spell (SPELL) is another memecoin that Deutscher praises, having increased by 41% since his entry and 67% in the last 12 days. He attributes its success to “unit bias and low market cap psychology,” emphasizing the psychological factors that drive retail investment in lower-priced tokens. “Spell is the lowest market cap meme on Coinbase, and unit bias is a real thing with retail,” he observes. Deutscher targets a multi-billion market caps for Spell, advocating for holding positions to fully capitalize on its growth potential. Related Reading: New Era For Crypto Regulation? SEC Chair Gensler Suggests He May Step Down Bonk (BONK) and Floki (FLOKI) are recognized by Deutscher for their consistent performance within the memecoin sector. “Bonk continues to be a strong performer,” Deutscher remarks, while FLOKI’s substantial gains of approximately 85% are noted as being driven by overall market momentum. “FLOKI benefits from the flywheel effect and overall market momentum,” he explains. Peanut the Squirrel (PEANUT) is highlighted for its explosive growth, having surged by an impressive 1,800% within the last nine days. Deutscher attributes its rapid rise to heightened retail investment and speculative trading. He underscores Peanut’s potential for continued growth, driven by its strong momentum and increasing market interest. “Peanut exemplifies the explosive potential within the memecoin arena,” he states. Goat (GOAT), the leading AI memecoin, has seen a fivefold increase over the past month and has crossed the $1 billion market cap with the latest surge. However, GOAT is far from done. “Goat is targeting multi-billions,” Deutscher asserts, indicating his confidence in its scalability and long-term viability. In addition to these primary memecoins, Deutscher also mentions SPX6900 (SPX) and Giga (GIGA) as newer additions to his portfolio, both showing positive returns. “SPX is considered a relative strength leader with potential for significant upside,” he elaborates, while Giga’s performance is tied to technical setups and anticipated exchange listings, making it a strong contender in the memecoin sector. “Giga remains a strong contender based on its technical setups and upcoming exchange listings,” Deutscher notes. Deutscher also touches on several other memecoins, including Popcat, MOG, Miggles, Flaky, Pups, Simon’s Cat, Toshi, Billy, and Paradise, each noted for their varying performances and niche market potentials. He observes, “animal coins have been super hot,” particularly cat-themed memecoins like Popcat and MOG, which he believes are ripe for rotation plays within their specific sub-sectors. In general, Deutscher emphasizes the current significance of exchange listings and weekend trading dynamics. “Weekend pumps have become a lot more probable across the board now that retail is back,” he explains, noting that retail investors are more active during weekends, driving substantial market movements. He also advocates for monitoring intra-rotations within memecoin sub-sectors, such as cat-themed coins, to capitalize on emerging trends and early investments.

Based on this, the analyst explained how the Bitcoin price could rally to as high as $113,000. Bitcoin Bullish Pennant Could Send Price To $113,000 In an X post, Trader Tardigrade mentioned a bullish pennant that had formed on the Bitcoin chart. The analyst remarked that the BTC price is still preparing for the next pump with this bullish pattern. A bullish pennant indicates the continuation of an uptrend following a brief consolidation period. Related Reading: XRP Price Rockets Past $1: On-Chain Data Unveils Key Holder Cohort Behind Breakout Trader Tardigrade said that the Bitcoin consolidation within the Pennant looks really healthy and good. He added that the Bitcoin price is climbing to the apex now and will make a breakout soon enough. In line with this, the analyst stated that the short-term target for the Bitcoin price remains $113,000. In a more recent X post, Trader Tardigrade noted that BTC closed its weekly candle close to its current all-time high (ATH) at $93,000. The analyst stated this is a significant sign, confirming the breakout candles from long-consolidating ranges. He added that he has noticed that the strength of the uptrend isn’t decreasing, which confirms that this is the beginning of the bull run. Based on historical trends, the analyst recently predicted that the Bitcoin price could rise to as high as $462,000 in this market cycle. He explained that massive bull runs have ended between Fibonacci extensions 1.618 and 2.272. Therefore, BTC could reach $173,000 at Fib extension 1.618 and rally to $462,000 if it reaches Fib extension 2.272. BTC Could Witness A Significant Price Correction First In an X post, crypto analyst Ali Martinez outlined several reasons why Bitcoin could be about to suffer a steep correction. Firstly, he stated that crypto enthusiasts are feeling extremely greedy at the moment. This greed is said to have spilled over retail investors as there has been a significant spike in Google search interest for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $1 Billion Exchange Outflow Alongside Bitcoin: What This Means For Price Secondly, the analyst mentioned that BTC investors have realized over $5.42 in profits, which puts the Bitcoin price at risk of facing significant selling pressure if these investors decide to secure some of these profits now. From a technical perspective, Martinez also noted that the TD Sequential has presented a sell signal on the BTC daily chart. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals that Bitcoin is currently overbought. If this BTC price correction happens, Martinez stated that the key support walls to watch are between $83,250 and $85,800 and between $72,880 and $75,520. However, the analyst added that a sustained daily close above $91,900 would invalidate this bearish Bitcoin outlook and would trigger a breakout to $100,680.

42415500,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgWV,1731948932,Beyond the Ballot: How DeFi Is Preparing for DC’s Next Chapter,"The 2024 election cycle has resulted in a deeply shaken-up political landscape for digital finance. With over $100 million in crypto industry spending across races and Trump's victory ushering in promises of a pro-crypto administration, the regulatory outlook has shifted in ways that may startle some. Amidst the headlines and market euphoria — Bitcoin surging past $90,000 after election night — we in the crypto industry need to refocus. The way forward cannot be about partisan politics. The discourse must center around how our industry steps into its new role in Washington.  Two months ago, I found myself before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets. That hearing now feels like a snapshot from a different era — before an election cycle that saw crypto emerge as a genuine campaign issue, complete with pledges for a national Bitcoin stockpile and promises to reshape regulation. What began as a technical discussion about DeFi's fundamentals has grown into a debate about America's role in the future of finance.  While the election has brought changes to key committees, including Financial Services, the fundamentals of responsible DeFi oversight shouldn't shift with political winds. Innovation, consumer protection, and financial inclusion are neither Republican nor Democratic values — they're American ones. The election results, particularly in races where crypto policy played a decisive role — like Bernie Moreno's victory over Sherrod Brown in Ohio — prove that voters across party lines are fueled into action by these issues.  For me, ""representing DeFi"" once meant advising small startups housed in Brooklyn apartments. Then, decentralized finance was largely an emerging movement within the larger crypto industry that foregrounded how decentralized software can upend many of our daily financial activities. Many of those building then could not have fathomed that this would become a central campaign issue, with candidates actively courting industry support and debating the future of digital assets.  The election results have amplified what we began to see in September's hearing: crypto's ability to transcend traditional political divisions. When Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) opened that session by declaring: ""DeFi [...] can make our financial system more accessible, transparent, efficient, and innovative."" In seeking “common ground in supporting both innovation and consumer protection,” he was previewing themes that would reshape campaign narratives across the country and serve as a guide for how crypto must emerge as a rare point of bipartisan cooperation in a polarized political climate.  We can achieve this common ground through three critical initiatives — with mutual effort by industry and policymakers:  First, education. With new faces arriving in Congress and committee assignments in flux, the September DeFi hearing's basic education mandate becomes even more crucial. This election cycle showed that when policymakers understand our technology, they're more likely to support it—evident in the victory margins of pro-crypto candidates who took time to learn the fundamentals.  Industry jargon is esoteric. For example, “wallets” aren’t leather billfolds (they’re more like email) and smart contracts – the software comprising DeFi – are neither “smart” nor “contracts”. To that end, I dedicated part of my written testimony to breaking down DeFi technology. Others who testified provided powerful analogies – the telegraph and switchboard operators – to demonstrate how other useful technology has evolved to eliminate intermediaries and provide better, more efficient systems.  Even as other U.S. regulators and policymakers begin engaging with DeFi, the industry must do a better job educating and engaging with their own representatives.  In addition to excellent DeFi policy advocates like the DeFi Education Fund and Coin Center, who also had representatives at the September hearing, founders and builders must speak personally about their work to give amorphous “DeFi” a tangible face. And policymakers must take time to understand the technology — who uses and benefits from it — before enacting regulation. That’s the same approach taken the world over — more time for analysis, exploration and innovation.  Second, build useful applications. During the hearing, representatives asked about financial and non-financial use cases. It was a privilege to answer questions and discuss The Value Prop, an open database cataloging use cases for blockchain-based applications across all crypto networks, like Ethereum, Bitcoin and more. I’ll say the quiet part out loud: For many, speculation is fun. But if the industry only chases the pump, it will never demonstrate the transformative value of DeFi.  Just as we must build meaningful use cases, policymakers must grapple with the reasons this technology matters. Rep. Mike Flood (R-NE) emphasized its revolutionary potential, zeroing in on its ability to redistribute power: Individuals can take ownership over their data, assets, and content, sans intermediaries.  Decentralizing legacy systems piqued my interest years ago in a Williamsburg loft with a four-person DeFi startup that built one of the world’s preeminent protocols.  I remain optimistic that we are building – as Rep. Nickel said – a system for “everyone.”  Third, keep DeFi safe. Bad actors are everywhere, in DeFi and TradFi alike. It was hard to miss certain representatives’ focus on this issue at the September hearing.  But one of DeFi’s inherent traits — transparent, real time data about transactions — is also its greatest asset in creating a safer system than the traditional financial world.  Is it possible to trace or track all illicit activity in DeFi? No. And it can’t be done in TradFi, either.  But as an industry, we can combat hacks and return stolen funds even without intermediaries. One (foreign) regulator told me months ago that TradFi excels in coming together to propose solutions to new problems — and that crypto should be doing the same. I co-authored a paper offering one such solution earlier this year — a three-part framework for combating illicit finance in DeFi  There are grassroots security efforts to ensure the system operates as safely as possible, like ZachXBT, the Security Alliance and others. And it’s important that this technology's utility is not overshadowed — even in narrative alone — by a few (high profile) bad actors.  Put simply, the industry must still innovate on security, while policymakers need to learn that it isn’t possible to map existing financial laws onto intermediary-less systems.  The future of DeFi regulation requires nuanced understanding and deep collaboration. Knowledgeable industry leaders and regulators, better use cases, and system security are essential to achieving the long-term benefits of this technology. The U.S. has an opportunity to lead, but only if we approach DeFi with the nuance and forward-thinking it deserves.

42415505,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgZe,1731946954,Polymarket Trader Loses Millions on Tyson After Making Bank on Trump,"This week in prediction markets:  A bettor who made millions correctly betting Trump would win loses a cool sum on Mike Tyson.  GOP firebrand Matt Gaetz probably won't be confirmed as AG.  Polymarket bettors are unsure if Americans are happy.  Can't win 'em all.  Polymarket user ""zxgngl"" pocketed $11.4 million by correctly betting that Republican candidate Donald Trump would re-take the White House. But he lost $3.4 million by taking the wrong side of Friday night's match-up between boxing legend Mike Tyson, and influencer-turned-pugilist Jake Paul.  Plenty of punters lost money with long-shot bets on Tyson, the geriatric underdog. But ""zxgngl"" was the night's biggest loser by far. The runner-up in losses clocked a negative $105,390 and the third-place loser is down $99,997.  Prediction markets are usually structured as yes/no bets on a given outcome; each share pays out $1 (in cryptocurrency, in Polymarket's case) if the bet proves correct, and zero if not. The price of a share, expressed in cents on the dollar, indicates the market's assessment, when translated into percentage terms, of the prediction coming true.  On the eve of the fight, ""yes"" shares in Paul were trading at 62 cents, signaling a 62% probability he would win. Punters gave 29% odds of Tyson overcoming the age advantage and an 11% chance of the fight ending in a draw or otherwise not designated as a win for either fighter.  Even before the match began, boxing commentators were saying that the ending was predictable, and the sad spectacle of a man old enough to be Paul's father laboring intensely to keep up with him in the ring didn't make for great television.  The fight almost certainly wasn't rigged, according to a separate Polymarket contract, which gives just a 1% chance of evidence emerging to the contrary by Nov. 23.  And for the record, there's not much of a Trump-Tyson correlation. The traders who lost money on the fight made a mix of bets on each presidential candidate.  Read More:Polymarket's Probe Highlights Challenges of Blocking U.S. Users (and Their VPNs)  Gaetz Probably Won't be Attorney General  Polymarket bettors don't think that Matt Gaetz will be confirmed as Attorney General, giving it a 21% chance of happening.  Florida's Gaetz is a controversial pick for Attorney General because he courts controversy.  Gaetz has been something of a professional troll while in Congress, with a taste for publicity stunts from picking fights with the Republican speaker of the house to making comments about the physical appearance of pro-abortion protestors – and doubling down on those comments. In the eyes of many, he's developed the reputation of an agitator rather than a professional legislator.  But Gaetz has also done exceptional work in the House in moving a bill that would restrict members of Congress from owning and trading individual stocks, which saw support from all sides of the political spectrum and counts Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as a co-sponsor.  Gaetz has faced allegations of sexual misconduct, drug use, and accepting inappropriate gifts. The allegations of sexual misconduct led to an investigation where prosecutors declined to press charges.  To be confirmed, Gaetz will need the support of 50 of the 53 Republicans in the Senate. Among those 50 are certainly bridges Gaetz has burned, or others that might have grown tired of his antics.  ""I don't think it's a serious nomination for the attorney general,"" Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski is quoted as saying in a recent press scrum.  And given the odds on Polymarket, the market tends to agree.  Meanwhile, at Kalshi, a U.S.-regulated prediction market where bets are settled in dollars, traders give Gaetz slightly better odds at 34%.  Read more:Polymarket, Prediction Betting Markets Vindicated by Trump's Strong Showing  Are we happy?  Will 2024 be a better year than 2023? Polymarket bettors say there's only a 34% chance that the Ipsos ""Me Personally"" tracker, which polls Americans on how their year went, will reveal that this year was better than the last.  Last year the survey found that Americans believed 2023 was generally a good year, driven by positive economic trends like low unemployment and falling inflation. Americans who were surveyed at the time were also optimistic that 2024 would be even better.  Fast forward to the penultimate month of 2024, and the economy is a bit of a mixed bag. Some economic indicators, like the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index, are signaling a recession risk and economic uncertainty heading into 2025; the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index has also declined for most of the year.  But at the same time, the economy continues to grow, with GDP up as well as increased investments in manufacturing as the re-industrialization of the U.S. continues. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up 23%, and bitcoin has blown past all-time highs with no signs of slowing down.  Does all this mean we are happy? The World Happiness Report gives a mixed grade. Overall, North Americans aren't much happier in 2024 than in 2023 and there has been a continued decline in happiness among young people aged 15-24. Maybe there's more to life than money and a good economy.

This pivotal moment on November 5 has provided a catalyst for the broader crypto market, further encouraging investment in digital assets. Bitcoin Holdings To Over $29 Billion Led by Bitcoin advocate Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy disclosed on Monday that it has acquired approximately 51,780 Bitcoin for around $4.6 billion. This acquisition marks the largest purchase by the company since it began its Bitcoin buying strategy more than four years ago. According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the tokens were purchased between November 11 and November 17. With this latest acquisition, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings now exceed $29 billion or 331,200 BTC.

Michael Saylor has also reaffirmed his commitment to this strategy. He aims to raise $42 billion over the next three years to further strengthen the company’s BTC portfolio and transform Microstrategy into a leading crypto bank.

However, with Monday’s announcement and the notable uptrend in the Bitcoin price over the past two weeks, Saylor revealed that these metrics have risen to a BTC yield of 20.4% and a net benefit to shareholders of 51,470 BTC.

Yet, as the leading digital asset of the market retraced to around $90,650—a 9% increase over the past week—MSTR’s share price also declined to approximately $359 over the past weekend, underscoring the strong relationship between the cryptocurrency and the firm’s stock performance.

36516974,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101893,1731944689,Cardano Founder Shares Who is Eligible for Midnight Airdrop,"As the development of Midnight progresses, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently gave hints on the eligibility criteria for its airdrop. Hoskinson shared new information about the Midnight airdrop during a surprise AMA session on Nov. 17, triggering both excitement and discussions within the Cardano community. Midnight , a privacy-focused sidechain under the Cardano ecosystem, is looking to revolutionize blockchain privacy. However, questions about eligibility and distribution mechanisms remain unanswered, leaving the community eager for more information.Hoskinson Discusses Midnight Airdrop Eligibility Recall that Midnight plans to introduce a dual-token model, incorporating both NIGHT and DUST . NIGHT tokens will serve governance and staking purposes, while DUST will act as the primary currency for transactions on the Midnight blockchain. In the AMA session , Hoskinson confirmed that ADA holders would be eligible for the DUST airdrop, which he referred to as a “glacier drop.” This process involves distributing Midnight’s Dust tokens to ADA stakeholders. However, recipients will need to participate in mining on the Midnight blockchain to fully acquire their tokens. Hoskinson highlighted that Cardano will be the primary platform for the token distribution, though more details are expected as the project progresses.Growing Community Inquiries Tobes, the founder of ZKDID, shared an excerpt of the AMA session, with several community members asking questions about airdrop mechanics and eligibility criteria. While Tobes provided some answers, he admitted much of his input was speculative due to the lack of official clarity.Responding to whether the airdrop depends on which pool users are delegating their ADA, Tobes suggested that an SPO would likely need to validate the Midnight chain. He speculated that eligibility might hinge on the stake managed by the SPO.The community figure also addressed concerns about ADA stored on platforms like Kraken. He noted that eligibility might depend on whether the exchange runs a Midnight validator using user stakes. He advised investors to consider moving their stake to increase their chances of eligibility.Another question raised was whether holding Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs) could substitute for ADA holdings. This remains uncertain, but Hoskinson did mention that the airdrop would go to “ADA holders.”Midnight Development Progressing Midnight stands out for its commitment to privacy and regulatory compliance. It employs zk-SNARK technology to secure transactions, ensuring that sensitive data remains confidential. Despite the excitement surrounding Midnight, both investors and ADA holders await clearer guidelines. As Hoskinson indicated, more announcements will be made as the project approaches its next phase of development. For now, the focus remains on ensuring ADA holders are informed and prepared to participate.In a previous disclosure, Hoskinson confirmed that the development of Midnight was moving smoothly, as a developer unveiled the first zkApp on the sidechain. Last month, the Cardano founder reacted to the launch of the Midnight testnet.",NEUTRAL,ADA,ADA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | AIRDROP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/cardano-founder-shares-who-is-eligible-for-midnight-airdrop/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cardano-founder-shares-who-is-eligible-for-midnight-airdrop,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

As the biggest meme coin by market capitalization, DOGE has again captured the spotlight, leading the market with its explosive performance. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s breakout from a bullish pattern. Runefelt emphasized the potential for DOGE to sustain its upward momentum, citing increased demand and positive market sentiment as key drivers. He also shared a short-term price target, suggesting further upside in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Sold Over 3,000 BTC In The Past 48 Hours – Consolidation Phase Ahead? Dogecoin’s ability to rally while consolidating above critical support levels demonstrates its resilience and growing popularity. The coin’s strong market presence, driven by community support and investor interest, positions it as a major contender for continued growth. As DOGE consolidates its gains, the coming days will determine whether it can maintain its momentum and climb higher. With analysts predicting further bullish price action, all eyes remain on Dogecoin as it continues to strengthen the meme coin market. Dogecoin Leading The Meme Coin Fever Meme coins have been standout performers in the past few weeks, with several outpacing traditional altcoins regarding gains and market enthusiasm. Among them, Dogecoin has taken center stage, showcasing impressive growth and sparking euphoric sentiment across the crypto community. Its recent rally has reignited interest in the meme coin sector, with many speculating about the next phase of its bullish momentum. Top analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a compelling technical analysis on X, highlighting Dogecoin’s breakout from a falling wedge pattern to the upside. This pattern, often seen as a bullish reversal signal, has led Runefelt to set a price target at $0.4385—the top of the wedge. If this projection materializes, DOGE could see an additional 18% rise in the coming days, solidifying its leadership among meme coins. However, despite the optimistic outlook, risks remain. Runefelt noted the possibility of a fakeout, where the breakout could fail, leaving bulls vulnerable as Dogecoin continues its current consolidation phase. This could lead to short-term volatility, with traders closely watching for confirmation of sustained momentum or signs of a potential pullback. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation For now, Dogecoin’s strong performance and clear bullish pattern make it a key asset to watch, with excitement and caution shaping investor sentiment. DOGE Testing Crucial Levels Dogecoin is trading at $0.371, marking its highest level since May 2021 and signaling a resurgence in bullish sentiment. The price recently retraced from local highs set last Tuesday, yet DOGE appears ready to keep pushing upward as it tests crucial demand levels. These levels are critical for establishing a foundation to fuel a move toward new highs, potentially reigniting excitement among meme coin enthusiasts. The retracement is a healthy pause following DOGE’s impressive rally over the past two weeks. Traders and analysts closely monitor the price action, as a successful hold above these demand levels could act as a springboard for the next leg up. However, caution remains as the broader crypto market looks to Bitcoin and Ethereum for direction. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance At $225 – ATH Next?

36514670,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101859,1731942934,Here is the Most Positive Sign for XRP and Its Price Spike,"While XRP recently shattered a three-year record amid its latest uptrend, the commendable feat has been marked by several factors. In a recent analysis , Santiment disclosed that XRP's multi-year high milestone follows significant accumulation from whale wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million XRP.Deep XRP Buying Before Price PumpOver the past week, this influential group has added 453.3 million tokens, equivalent to $526 million to their holdings. This substantial accumulation brought their collective holdings to nearly 18% of XRP's circulating supply—the highest level in two months.The surge in whale activity coincides with a contrasting trend among retail traders. Wallets holding less than 1 million XRP offloaded around 76 million tokens valued at $88 million over the same period, likely attempting to lock in short-term profits. This divergence in behavior shows a broader market narrative: while retail traders display hesitancy, major investors are doubling down on XRP's long-term potential. According to Santiment, sustained whale accumulation has historically served as a bullish signal for any crypto asset. Large stakeholders tend to have a firm conviction in their investments, and their confidence can drive market cap growth. The recent XRP price spike supports this theory, as whale-driven demand has offset retail selling pressure and fueled upward momentum.Whales Control a Combined 45.61B XRP SupplyIn response to Santiment’s analysis, community member Machzilla commented that most of the XRP supply will eventually be controlled by wealthy venture capitalists, institutional investors, and savvy retail investors who recognize its value. In his view, only a small fraction will be left to frustrated traders and those who regret betting against XRP's positive momentum.Santiment noted in an earlier report that wallets holding at least 1 million XRP controlled a combined total of 45.61 billion tokens as of November 14, the highest amount since June 2018. The analysis also highlighted that whales have adjusted their strategy over the past two years, accumulating an additional 3.44 billion XRP . Meanwhile, the price of XRP continued to decline until recently, when the effects of this multi-year accumulation began to take hold.With XRP trading at $1.14, its price is up 6.5% today and has surged more than 101% over the past week.XRP At Peak Popularity on Google SearchAnother key factor behind XRP’s recent uptrend is the surge in public interest , as evidenced by Google Trends. According to the data, XRP's popularity score peaked at 100 over the weekend—its highest level since April 2021.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/here-is-the-most-positive-sign-for-xrp-and-its-price-spike/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-the-most-positive-sign-for-xrp-and-its-price-spike,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This substantial purchase highlights the company’s ongoing commitment to its Bitcoin strategy, which has been spearheaded by Executive Chairman Michael Saylor. The funds for these acquisitions were sourced from the company's At-the-Market (ATM) program, which involves issuing and selling shares to raise capital. So far, MicroStrategy has utilized approximately $5.7 billion of its $21 billion ATM program , leaving $15.3 billion available . At this pace, the company could potentially exhaust the program by the end of the year if they maintain their current purchasing trend. This latest purchase brings MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings to 331,200 BTC , equivalent to approximately 1.58% of the total Bitcoin supply. This significant accumulation underscores their long-term belief in Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. From October 1 to November 17, the company reported a Bitcoin yield of 20.4%, reflecting the growing value of their holdings during this period. Year-to-date, their Bitcoin yield stands at an impressive 41.8%, solidifying their position as one of the most prominent institutional Bitcoin holders. MicroStrategy’s strategy of leveraging equity sales to fund Bitcoin purchases remains unique among publicly traded companies, further cementing its reputation as a pioneer in this space. Under Michael Saylor’s leadership, the company has consistently demonstrated confidence in Bitcoin’s potential as a store of value and a hedge against traditional market volatility . As they continue to deploy capital through the ATM program, it will be interesting to see how their approach evolves and how it impacts the broader crypto market. MicroStrategy’s moves often signal strong institutional interest in Bitcoin, influencing market sentiment and investor confidence. Their bold approach aligns with their long-standing belief in Bitcoin’s potential, and this recent announcement serves as another example of their unwavering commitment to their digital asset strategy.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/highlights-of-microstrategy-s-bitcoin-purchases,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36513490.jpeg

Over the weekend, Bitcoin exhibited significant resilience despite a brief dip below the $89,000 threshold on Sunday. This temporary drop, driven by bearish pressure, was quickly countered by strong buying activity, which propelled the cryptocurrency into a sharp V-shaped recovery. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $89,804.34, reflecting a 0.88% decline over the past 24 hours. However, the broader trend remains positive, with the cryptocurrency posting a 9.26% gain over the past week.Historical Patterns Suggest Growth for BitcoinA recent analysis by Ali Martinez highlighted similarities between Bitcoin’s current price movements and its behavior in late 2020. In the earlier cycle, Bitcoin surged 26% after breaking its $19,700 all-time high, consolidated briefly, and then climbed to $40,000. Martinez observed that Bitcoin has mirrored this trend recently, with a 28% rise after surpassing its previous peak and consolidating for six days. Indeed, after hitting $93K last week, Bitcoin lost momentum for further growth.However, Martinez suggested that this pattern could indicate a repetition of past performance, suggesting further upside potential beyong $100K if the trend holds. Technical insights from Crypto Rover added weight to the bullish outlook, pointing to a broadening wedge pattern on the monthly chart.The analyst shared a chart suggesting Bitcoin recently broke through its resistance, which aligns with the wedge’s upper boundary. According to the analysis, the breakout pattern implies a possible price target of $150,000 for Bitcoin.Institutional Backing Strengthens Bitcoin’s OutlookInstitutional support has been another key factor driving optimism. Michael Saylor, Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, recently stated that Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 by year-end. Saylor attributed this projection to growing institutional adoption and reduced regulatory uncertainties. He highlighted the role of major players like BlackRock in boosting Bitcoin’s market credibility and fostering positive sentiment within the financial sector.Saylor also pointed to political developments in the United States, emphasizing the impact of recent elections. He noted that the evolving political landscape is expected to bring regulatory clarity, which could pave the way for broader institutional participation. This shift, he argued, diminishes near-term risks and strengthens Bitcoin’s position as a viable investment.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/bitcoin-mirrors-2020-rally-after-28-surge-boosting-expectations-for-a-100k-run/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-mirrors-2020-rally-after-28-surge-boosting-expectations-for-a-100k-run,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36514668,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101877,1731942143,Bernstein Cites 3 Factors That Could Push Bitcoin to $200K,"Bernstein expresses confidence in its ambitious price prediction for Bitcoin, highlighting three factors that could propel BTC to the six-digit target by 2025 ending. In a note to its clients, Bernstein analysts, led by Gautam Chhugani, emphasized that Bitcoin is fast approaching its 2025 target of $200,000, noting that the prediction no longer looks delusional following BTC’s recent surge to almost $100,000. Bernstein Sets $200,000 Target for Bitcoin It bears mentioning that Bernstein first issued the $200,000 prediction in June 2024. Ever since, the company has remained optimistic about the prediction, emphasizing that Bitcoin would achieve the target by 2025. Earlier this month, specifically on the eve of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, the company asserted that Bitcoin’s price will surge to $200,000 by next year, irrespective of who wins the election. 3 Factors That Could Push Bitcoin to $200,000 Interestingly, Donald Trump’s victory boosted Bernstein’s confidence in the $200,000 prediction, thanks to his pro-crypto cabinet featuring prominent crypto enthusiasts like Pete Hegseth, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and Elon Musk . Amid growing enthusiasm for crypto potential under Trump’s administration, Bernstein highlighted three factors that could propel BTC’s price to $200,000 by next year. Pro-Crypto Regulatory Promises First, Bernstein analysts cited Trump’s pro-crypto promises, which aim to elevate the United States to become the crypto capital of the world. The U.S. President-elect promised several initiatives for the crypto industry, including keeping anti-crypto lawmakers away from crypto and giving the CFTC more regulatory authority over the industry, drastically reducing the SEC’s regulation by enforcement approach against crypto businesses. Notably, the analysts speculated that implementing these promises could bolster investors’ confidence in crypto, fueling a sustained rally in the prices of Bitcoin and other altcoins like Ethereum. U.S. National Bitcoin Reserve The analysts identified Trump’s pledge of a national Bitcoin reserve as another catalyst that could push BTC to $200,000. They stated that the political process of establishing a Bitcoin reserve in the U.S. has commenced with Trump’s victory. However, they suggested that the initiative might take a longer legislative process before coming to fruition. In July, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced the Bitcoin Act of 2024, proposing that the United States acquire 5% of Bitcoin’s supply over the next five years. The proposal suggests that the Secretary of State keep the assets for 20 years. Reacting, Bernstein analysts stated that while retail, institutions, and corporate clients drive Bitcoin’s demand in the current cycle, they expect sovereign entities to take the lead by the next cycle. Growing Institutional Demand Furthermore, the brokerage company highlighted the growing institutional demand for Bitcoin as another factor that could propel it to the $200,000 mark. This is reflected in MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation spree , increased Bitcoin ETFs’ assets under management (AUM), and miners' continuous hoarding of Bitcoin. Analysts at Bernstein noted that these developments reduce the selling pressure on Bitcoin. They urged investors to hold BTC as the pro-crypto regulatory era has yet to price in. With Bitcoin currently trading at $89,903, the world’s largest cryptocurrency must surge 122.46% to hit the $200,000 mark.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/bernstein-cites-3-factors-that-could-push-bitcoin-to-200k/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bernstein-cites-3-factors-that-could-push-bitcoin-to-200k,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Stellar (XLM) has become the latest cryptocurrency to engineer a breakout as the broader market bullish sentiment has rubbed off on the asset. While Bitcoin consolidates following its explosion to above $90,000, XLM has swung to a three-year price high.The 20th-ranked cryptocurrency by market cap has surged an impressive 116% in the past seven days, rising beyond $0.200. Furthermore, XLM is up a staggering 144% in the past month, benefiting extensively from the prevailing bullish market momentum and following XRP's path.Meanwhile, XLM’s recent upsurge has drawn the attention of major market analysts, including seasoned commentator Egrag. In a Monday tweet , Egrag noted that the 116% weekly surge is the start of XLM’s space launch, predicting a rise to unprecedented price territories.Countdown to XLM’s Explosive UpsurgeEgrag’s November 18 analysis shows further upsides remain for Stellar . The seasoned analyst noted that XLM’s “space launch” is imminent, expecting the bullish vibes around the coin to continue.In an accompanying chart, Egrag based his assertions on a structural pattern, targeting the Inter Stellar Gateway zone. Per the chart, the analyst speculated that XLM would complete its wave-like price structure, anticipating a surge to the pattern’s high between $0.794 and $1.057. XLM Inter Stellar Gate way | EGRAG Crypto Notably, the Inter Stellar Gateway zone surge would entail an upsurge between 233% and 343% from the current price. XLM would also grow past its current all-time high of $0.9381, attained in January 2018.XLM to Repeat Last Cycle’s Success?In another analysis , Egrag speculated that Stellar might replicate its price surge from the last cycle. For instance, XLM surged 3,162% from its low of $0.025 in March 2020 to the cycle’s top at $0.804 in May 2021.Per Egrag’s attached chart, he asserted that XLM could achieve a similar feat in this cycle. Having already surged over 2,312% from this cycle’s bottom, Egrag expects a further 850% uptick to $2.2700. Egrag XLM Analysis Meanwhile, XLM begins the week on a high, soaring an impressive 16% in the past 24 hours.

36514665,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101861,1731940688,Retail FOMO Drives Bitcoin Transactions Under $100K to 3-Year High: Is This a Warning Sign?,"Bitcoin sees a notable rebound as retail investor activity spikes, with rising small-value transactions signaling FOMO. Bitcoin rebounded to $91,612 on Monday after a bearish weekend that saw its price dip to $87,000. The cryptocurrency gained 0.96% in the last 24 hours and 11.79% over the past week. This uptick coincides with rising retail investor activity, according to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant.Young Ju pointed to a surge in small-value Bitcoin transactions under $100,000, marking a three-year high. This trend, indicated by Bitcoin’s Spent Output Value Bands (SOVB), reflects increased participation from retail investors. Typically, retail activity rises when market optimism grows, especially during upward price movements.https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1858383043700064299Small-Value Bitcoin TransactionsData from CryptoQuant illustrates that transactions below $100,000 have become the most prominent segment in the SOVB metric. This surge in small-value transactions is a sign of rising retail investor activity. Historically, increased retail engagement often precedes broader market rallies, driven by fear of missing out (FOMO).The recent increase suggests growing confidence among smaller investors as Bitcoin approaches the $100,000 mark. However, the CEO cautions that these shifts could also attract larger investors seeking liquidity.Hint of Future CorrectionsDespite the bullish momentum, Young Ju warned of potential corrections in the short term. He noted that Bitcoin's futures perpetual market remains overleveraged, signaling possible volatility ahead. Nevertheless, he emphasized that such corrections would not signify the onset of a bear market. According to Young Ju, the current capital inflow suggests Bitcoin’s upper limit could reach $135,000 in this cycle. While long-term bullish sentiment persists, traders are advised to exercise caution when using leverage to avoid overexposure.Bitcoin as Economic SolutionIn related developments, Robert F. Kennedy, a former U.S. presidential candidate, reiterated his support for Bitcoin. In a viral video, Kennedy revealed that a substantial portion of his wealth is now invested in Bitcoin. His pro-Bitcoin stance emerged after attending the 2023 Bitcoin Conference, which influenced his financial decisions. Kennedy has consistently promoted Bitcoin to address economic challenges, such as inflation and the weakening U.S. dollar.

36511864,https://blog.kraken.com/?p=26672,1731940316,Beyond schedules and time zones: Can TradFi keep up with the 24/7 crypto revolution?,"By Thomas Perfumo, Kraken Head of Strategy As crypto’s influence grows, it is clear TradFi must adapt as 24/7 trading becomes a global and generational expectation. Born for this: The crypto advantage Cryptocurrencies revolutionize trading by allowing transactions to occur anytime, anywhere. This democratizes access, enabling a global community of investors to engage in trading whenever they choose. Born in the digital age, crypto’s inception takes full advantage of all the power and efficiency a widely distributed internet has to offer. Crypto doesn’t have to worry about the deeply embedded difficulties in upgrading outdated, semi-analog systems because those systems simply never mattered to crypto in the first place. Cryptocurrencies, unshackled by time zones and traditional market constraints, are redefining trading. They leverage technology to offer seamless, round-the-clock access and provide a stark contrast to the limitations faced by traditional systems. The most legacy of legacy systems: TradFi’s disadvantage Traditional markets, such as stock exchanges, have historically operated within set hours and are often closed altogether on weekends and holidays. This limited access is increasingly seen as a disadvantage in a world where digital assets never stop trading. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) was founded in 1792. The U.S. president was George Washington. The French Revolution was in full swing. Over 230 years of law, power structures and relationships come to bear any time a significant change in its operations are considered. Still, the NYSE is exploring the possibility of 24/7 trading for equities, recognizing the growing demand for continuous market access. The world’s largest and most liquid stock market offers equities that are largely owned by global traders and investors. Many have to conduct their workdays in the middle of the night to accommodate the NYSE’s current 6.5-hour window of regular trading from 9:30 a.m.-4:00 p.m. ET. Of course, only Monday through Friday, and not even then on U.S. federal holidays. Traditional financial institutions, rooted in centuries-old practices, are struggling to adapt to the demands of continuous trading. The NYSE’s tentative steps towards 24/7 operations highlight the growing pressure to evolve. Philosophical and functional challenges in transitioning The transition to 24/7 trading poses significant challenges for TradFi, including resistance from its gatekeepers. High-friction, limited-hour, slow-settlement transactions maximize the power of intermediaries — like exchanges, brokers and clearinghouses — which each have their own interests. Few are served by the faster, nonstop, instant settlement standards of crypto. A web of TradFi intermediaries and participants would have to agree to work together to make 24/7 trading successful. Such technical and motivational complexities are high hurdles for the adoption of nonstop trading hours. The TradFi system is built on principles that inherently create friction, such as circuit breakers in equity markets or changes to “market norms,” such as benchmarks — as reflected in the slow transition from LIBOR to SOFR . Making changes in an integrated system that is over 100 years old poses systemic challenges. Even the above shift, from one benchmark number to another, threatened global functional integrity, per the New York Fed : “The pervasive use of LIBOR across all market segments made the transition particularly complex, since the disruption or cessation of LIBOR posed significant risks to financial stability overall.” Transitioning to 24/7 trading is fraught with philosophical and operational challenges for TradFi. The entrenched interests of intermediaries and the complexity of legacy systems pose significant obstacles to enacting this shift any time soon. A legacy system’s self-interested inertia Another reason TradFi has relied on mechanisms that introduce friction at the expense of clients is that they help to slow down market activity, making it easier for intermediaries to protect their interests during times of market stress. For example, banks historically slowed down physical services during runs to prevent panic withdrawals. But the rapid bank failures witnessed in recent years, triggered by digital withdrawals, highlight the challenges of adapting legacy systems to the digital age. But a new generation of traders has never known anything other than a digital world of instant accessibility, even while on the move. As the overall market’s expectations and demands change, TradFi will have to adapt to meet the moment. TradFi’s reliance on friction-inducing mechanisms reflect a self-preserving inertia. In making a change, TradFi standard bearers will have to show allegiance to end clients above the intermediaries who have always taken their cut. The “toll taker” will resist a change in structure particularly because their very existence is on the line. Crypto was built by the people to serve the people; it doesn’t face the same existential questions. TradFi’s arduous road ahead The 24/7 trading revolution has begun. The future of finance will belong to those who can embrace this new reality. Traditional markets must rise to the challenge or risk being further eclipsed by the relentless innovations of the crypto world – including directly competitive products like 24/7-trading tokenized stocks. TradFi’s futures competitiveness will depend on its ability to integrate blockchain technology and continuous trading. The path forward will require swapping out entrenched systems and attitudes for new technologies that can offer the same level of accessibility and efficiency that cryptocurrency already provides.

This marks a major milestone, pushing year-to-date inflows to a record $33.5 billion. This influx follows an $11.7 billion rally since September, fueled by interest rate cuts and growing optimism surrounding crypto markets. However, Bitcoin’s all-time price highs last week triggered mixed reactions, shaping market flows across regions and assets.Bitcoin Leading the Way for Investment InflowsSpecifically, Bitcoin led the pack with inflows of $1.48 billion, benefiting from a price surge that broke previous all-time highs. The excitement drove total assets under management (AuM) to an unprecedented $138 billion earlier in the week. However, as prices reached record levels, $866 million in outflows followed in the latter half of the week, reflecting profit-taking by investors. Interestingly, this price activity also spurred $49 million in inflows to short Bitcoin products, signaling hedging strategies among some investors.Ethereum Inflows ReboundMeanwhile, Ethereum-based investments rebounded strongly last week, securing $646 million in inflows, which accounted for 5% of their total AuM. This marks a recovery after weeks of muted activity. Analysts attribute Ethereum’s rebound to renewed enthusiasm surrounding Justin Drake's Beam Chain network upgrade proposal and the favorable market outlook post-US elections.Solana, XRP, and Other AssetsSolana investment products continued their upward trend, securing $24 million in inflows, while XRP-based investments added $4.3 million, maintaining steady growth. Additionally, ETPs for Litecoin and Cardano saw modest inflows of $0.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively.In contrast, Binance Coin (BNB) and multi-asset products experienced negative flows last week, while Tron (TRX) saw no investment change. Crypto investment products weekly inflows chart CoinShares Regional Sentiment: Mixed SignalsRegional inflows were mixed last week.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong, Australia, and Canada saw more modest inflows of $27 million, $18 million, and $13 million, respectively.At the same time, profit-taking dampened activity in Europe, with Sweden and Germany recording outflows of $58 million and $6.8 million, respectively.",POSITIVE,BNB,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/bitcoin-leads-2-2b-weekly-inflows-as-crypto-investments-hit-record-33-5b/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-leads-2-2b-weekly-inflows-as-crypto-investments-hit-record-33-5b,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

This comeback marks a possible turning point for ADA, with renewed momentum driving the price higher and signaling a resumption of its uptrend. As buying interest strengthens, market sentiment appears to be shifting in favor of the bulls, raising the question: how far can Cardano climb in the coming days? All eyes are now on key resistance levels as ADA’s rally gains steam, fueling hopes for sustained growth. This analysis aims to delve into Cardano’s recent rebound from the $0.6822 support level and its implications for the asset’s future trajectory. By examining key technical indicators, market sentiment, and potential resistance levels, this piece seeks to assess whether ADA’s momentum can sustain its upward trend or encounter challenges along the way. Market Sentiment Shifts: Are Bulls Back In Control? Presently, ADA is demonstrating renewed positive strength after rebounding from the $0.6822 support level, steadily advancing toward the $0.8119 resistance level. This recovery indicates a significant shift in sentiment, with buying pressure triggering more price growth. Notably, Cardano is trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart, which not only reinforces the bullish trend but provides a strong foundation for further gains if ADA successfully breaks above the $0.8119 resistance. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI is trying to climb back above the 70% threshold after experiencing a decline to 57%, signaling a resurgence in buying pressure, reflecting renewed bullish momentum in the market. A break above the 70% level would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the potential for more price gains. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) To Reach $6 By September 2025? Analyst Forecast 2021-Like Rally Also, the daily chart reveals strong upward movement for ADA, marked by the formation of a bullish candlestick as it recovers from the $0.6822 level. Trading above the crucial 100-day SMA reinforces the positive trend, indicating sustained strength. As Cardano continues to climb, it bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for growth. Furthermore, the daily chart’s RSI is currently at 80%, indicating robust optimistic sentiment as it remains above the 50% threshold. This surge follows a brief dip to 60%, showing that buying pressure has returned. While the high RSI suggests the asset is overbought, it also signals continued strength, pointing to possible gains. Next Targets For Cardano: Can The Rally Sustain Its Pace? ADA has demonstrated strong bullish momentum after bouncing from the $0.6822 support level, advancing toward the key resistance at $0.8119. Its ability to stay above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart suggests sustained strength, signaling that Cardano could maintain its upward movement. A successful break above the $0.8119 resistance could propel the price toward the $1.26 resistance level, setting the stage for a price spike. Related Reading: Cardano Price Prediction: Analyst Sounds Alarm Of Break Through Key Resistance, Why A Rally Could Follow However, if the rally faces difficulty breaking through the $0.8119 resistance, it may result in pullbacks or consolidation, shifting focus toward key support levels.

42415504,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgZ1,1731938411,Lido Co-Founders Said to Plot Competitor to Sam Altman's World Network,"Over two years ago, Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI, launched Worldcoin, a blockchain project known for its distinctive metal orb used to scan eyeballs.  Recently rebranded as “World Network,” the platform provides users with digital passports — verified through the iris scans — to help online services differentiate humans from bots in an AI-driven internet.  Now, a group of crypto veterans, including the co-founders of decentralized finance juggernaut Lido, are preparing to launch “Y,” a blockchain identity platform aimed squarely at competing with World Network.  CoinDesk obtained an internal planning document for the new project. A person close to Cyber Fund, the venture firm led by Lido co-founders Konstantin Lomashuk and Vasiliy Shapovalov, confirmed the document is genuine. It lays out a vision for a new blockchain-based identity platform that skips World's controversial eyeball-scanning Orb.  Cyber Fund declined to comment. Ekram Ahmed, the head of marketing and communications for the blockchain infrastructure project Celestia, told CoinDesk he was also joining Y as an advisor. The upcoming project is not otherwise connected to Celestia, Ahmed said.  The document, titled ""Y vs. WorldCoin,"" describes how Y plans to play up World Network’s controversies — from privacy concerns, to accusations of exploitative user recruitment practices, to a generalized phobia of the project's metallic iris-scanning orb — as it courts users.  Rather than biometric data, Y will look at the traces people leave behind while using the internet to verify they are human. This method, according to the Y planning document, addresses privacy risks and minimizes fraud — in sharp contrast to World’s reliance on iris scans.  Long-term vision  Over time, Y's creators apparently intend to build a ""Crypto SuperApp that allows users to privately build and earn from their digital identity."" The vision isn't far off from that of World Network, whose product suite includes an identity-centric blockchain, crypto wallet and app ecosystem.  The Y document is scarce on implementation details, focusing instead on how Y will be marketed as a ""direct competitor to WorldCoin"" – a strategy explicitly designed to ""attract maximum attention.""  Like World, Y will ostensibly help internet users identify themselves as humans, which is expected to become increasingly important as AI tools and AI-generated content fool legacy identity solutions.  The key difference between the two platforms will be how they authenticate users.  Whereas World assigns users ""World IDs"" using biometric data – those creepy iris scans – Y ""aggregates data from users’ existing socials and blockchain activity, and also employs the Ethereum Attestation Service"" to verify users. The Ethereum Attestation Service is a set of tools people can use to formally ""attest"" to the accuracy of certain data, which can be useful for applications like user authentication.  According to the authors of the planning document reviewed by CoinDesk, Y's authentication processes are designed to address some of WorldCoin's shortcomings, such as ""eliminating risks related to biometric data leaks and minimizing opportunities for fraud.""  Y's ""social-graph-based"" approach is also meant to provide a more ""nuanced numerical score"" to determine a user's ""personhood"" compared to World's Orb, which delivers a simple binary reading on whether or not a person is human.  Throwing shade  According to the planning document reviewed by CoinDesk, Y's marketing will focus on World Network's ""controversial aspects.""  Chief among the project's controversies has been its reliance on biometric data. World maintains that it securely encrypts iris scans, but as the authors of the Y document note, the service has nonetheless ""sparked serious privacy concerns, resulting in bans in countries like Spain and Kenya.""  World has also led to the proliferation of black markets, where users can buy and sell scans to create fake accounts. Moreover, its reliance on centralized hardware and connections to OpenAI have sparked concern among some decentralization-minded crypto natives.  If Y intends to compete head-on with World, it will need to make up a lot of ground in terms of user numbers. World launched in 2023 and has since onboarded more than 15 million users, according to numbers released last month by the project. Seven million of those users have reportedly been authenticated by World's Orb, with the rest opting for a lower-tier World ID that doesn't require eyeball scanning.  Lido is the largest decentralized finance app on Ethereum, with more than $26 billion in ""staked"" deposits from investors who ""stake"" ETH with the platform to help power Ethereum's security.  In addition to leveraging their clout among crypto netizens to promote Y, Lido's founders are likely to seize on World's connections to OpenAI in their bid to attract users.

BTC has now climbed above silver, and is the eighth largest asset in the world by market cap. The new BTC all-time high came after a 39.5 percent surge in under nine days. The rally not only represents the most substantial 9-day climb since January 2021 for Bitcoin, but is also likely one of the largest short-term capital inflows into any asset class in recorded history. Such momentum suggests that the appetite for Bitcoin is reaching levels of interest typically reserved for mainstream assets. US-traded spot Bitcoin ETFs have reached $84 billion in assets under management, equivalent to 66 percent of the total AUM of gold ETFs. It is also healthy that there has been some very recent cooling of investor fervour, with approximately $640 million in net outflows reported over the last two trading days of the week. We are not expecting such flows to be sustained, however. With institutional inflows on the rise and ETFs capturing market share at an accelerated pace, Bitcoin’s trajectory seems poised for further long-term ascension, potentially reshaping the balance of capital allocation for years to come. These developments come against an economic backdrop which indicates continuing resilience in the US economy, but also emerging challenges, particularly to inflation. In October, inflation actually rose, driven by rising shelter costs and used car prices, only offset to a degree by declining energy prices. The labour market also remains robust, with low layoffs and rising wages fuelling consumer spending. October’s retail sales exceeded expectations, bolstered by steady wage growth and household wealth, signalling continued economic momentum. However, fiscal policies, including proposed tariffs and higher government spending, raise concerns about inflationary pressures, complicating the Federal Reserve’s approach to rate cuts. As markets adapt to these dynamics, the economic outlook remains strong but delicately balanced. In the meantime, the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve. Speculation surrounds SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s potential departure as his most recent remarks recapping his achievements hinted at someone wanting to highlight his legacy, which has featured reforms across equity markets, corporate governance, and crypto regulation. On the retail front, Robinhood has expanded its cryptocurrency portfolio by adding Solana, Cardano, Ripple, and Pepe to its selection of tradable crypto assets. Meanwhile, momentum is building around the proposal for a US Bitcoin reserve. Michael Saylor and Senator Cynthia Lummis advocate for expanding the US holdings of Bitcoin, with Saylor describing the potential acquisition as “the greatest deal of the 21st century.” These shifts underscore the dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency industry and its rapid adaptation to market demands.

SOL advanced 4.3% in the past 24 hours, outperforming the broad-market benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index's 1.6% gain. Bitcoin, meanwhile, pulled back slightly to just above $90,000 before U.S. trading hours as investors digested the monster rally to records since Donald Trump's election victory. Still, the largest crypto's pause may be only temporary: BTC may potentially climb as high as $200,000, according to BCA Research analysis of fractal patterns.  JPMorgan's retail sentiment score for bitcoin and bitcoin-tied assets hit a record as crypto euphoria spread. The metric, which is designed to gauge the sentiment of retail investors toward cryptos based on activity in BTC-related products including spot ETFs, climbed to an all-time high of 4 last week, indicating investor frenzy. MicroStrategy (MSTR) options positioning also shows extreme levels of bullishness typically seen near local market peaks. ""Call skew in MSTR is so wildly euphoric that it is hard to imagine we don't see a more meaningful drawdown unless bitcoin continues to move in a parabolic fashion higher,"" pseudonymous analyst Markets&Mayhem said.  XRP catapulted to a three-year high over the weekend to more than $1.20 with futures bets soaring to record levels. Open interest for XRP derivatives surpassed $2 billion on Sunday, betting on further volatility in the price of the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. The trend is fueled by optimism about easing regulatory headwinds as a crypto-friendly Trump administration may benefit tokens linked to U.S.-based companies such as Ripple Labs. Additionally, the forthcoming addition of Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin and French bank Société Générale-backed euro stablecoin to XRP Ledger could boost institutional adoption of the network.  Chart of the Day  The solana-bitcoin (SOL/BTC) ratio’s prolonged triangular consolidation has resolved with a bullish breakout, hinting at SOL outperformance ahead.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Metaplanet Follows MSTR's Lead, Announces $11.3M Debt Sale for Additional Bitcoin Purchases  An Interview With El Salvador’s Top Crypto Regulator: ‘Developing Countries Can Lead the Financial Revolution’  Kraken, Tether-Backed Dutch Firm Rolls Out MiCA-Compliant Euro, U.S. Dollar Stablecoins",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/18/first-mover-americas-solana-breaks-out-to-new-cycle-highs,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3bf49f4401e564651326099494c5141d3e52ffdd-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The cryptocurrency’s market capitalization increased by $20 billion to approximately $64 billion on November 17, when it reached $1.23. This surge has incited a frenzy of discourse within the cryptocurrency community; however, it is not solely the price that is garnering attention. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike The Pot Is Being Stirred By Rumors Of A Meeting With Trump Most of the conjecture about XRP’s surge stems from unsubstantiated accounts that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse met with President-elect Donald Trump. Though neither Garlinghouse nor Trump’s staff have confirmed or refuted the meeting, the rumors have spurred discussions across the sector. Brad Garlinghouse is shilling XRP and CBDC implementations.

This has strengthened the belief that, should government change, more favorable conditions could exist for crypto activities running within the United States. Whale Activity And Bullish Sentiment Drive The Rise Of XRP The rise of XRP is not solely due to speculative conjecture; it is substantiated by robust market data. Whale activity has been increasing, as evidenced by reports of substantial XRP transfers exceeding $316 million in the span of two days. Their action might be the decisive step for a price rise, as such large-scale transactions typically indicate the big holders’ positive mood. Secondly, the Relative Strength Index indicates that XRP is in the boundary of an overbought area; in other words, the surge has already reached its maximum. However, the level of hope is rather high, and most people think that the trend will continue.

This, in conjunction with the increasing institutional interest in Ripple’s native token, could be a further catalyst for the sustained growth of XRP. XRP is currently trading at $1.16, making it the best-performing cryptocurrency in the top 10 by market capitalization. Investors are eager to observe its future trajectory. Ripple’s future is unquestionably attracting significant attention, regardless of whether the rumors regarding a Trump meeting are accurate.

Notably, Dogecoin was one of the best performers in the broader market rally in early November, soaring 177% from $0.1582 on Nov. 5 to a three-year peak of $0.4385 on Nov. 12. Despite a recent pullback, DOGE has held above $0.37, with market watchers expecting further upside .In the most recent updates, three notable analysts—Trader Tardigrade, Crypto Yapper, and Bark—have identified important structures suggesting that the original meme coin could be on the brink of a major breakout.DOGE Within the Gaussian ChannelTrader Tardigrade shared a chart highlighting Dogecoin’s performance on the weekly timeframe within the Gaussian channel. This channel alternates between bullish and bearish zones, highlighting important support and resistance levels. Dogecoin Gaussian Channel | Trader Tardigrade Data from the chart shows that Dogecoin is currently sitting at the mid-band of the Gaussian channel, a position it has reached only twice before in its history. Historical data confirms that such interactions with the mid-band have led to massive price rallies. In early 2017, Dogecoin held support at this level before surging from around $0.0002 to over $0.0187 in December 2018. This marked a staggering 93x increase in less than a year.A similar event unfolded in late 2020, where DOGE found support at the mid-band. Notably, as of November 2020, Dogecoin changed hands at $0.002. However, the token rallied 36,850% from this level to the all-time high of $0.7390 in May 2021. Now, in 2024, DOGE is again testing this important zone in the Gaussian channel, currently trading at $0.375. If history repeats, Tardigrade predicts an “incredible pump,” potentially propelling the price to new highs. His chart presents a possible rally toward the $11 mark. Notably, this would mark a 2,852% rally from current prices, still significantly lower than the 2020/2021 surge.DOGE Forms Symmetrical TrianglesMeanwhile, Crypto Yapper focused on the short-term price action, sharing a one-hour chart that reveals a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern formed following Dogecoin’s drop from the peak of $0.4385 earlier this month. Dogecoin 1H Chart | Crypto Yapper The analyst suggests that the breakout could occur within hours and anticipates a “huge price explosion” to follow. If DOGE breaks above the $0.4385 resistance, it could target higher levels, with $0.50 and $0.55 serving as psychological benchmarks. Bark supported Crypto Yapper’s commentary with an analysis of a similar symmetrical triangle on the four-hour chart. However, the longer timeframe indicates a more significant breakout potential. https://twitter.com/barkmeta/status/1858319638972514772Bark describes this breakout as one that could be “historic.” With DOGE currently holding above the $0.35 support level, the analyst sees little resistance preventing a move toward $0.50 or beyond once the triangle gives way.

42415494,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgSj,1731932300,"Project Liberty Joins SOAR to Challenge Centralized Social Media Giants With AI, Decentralized Data","SOAR creator Paul Allen previously built a family social networking app on top of Facebook, which gathered 120 million users.  Project Liberty says it is the leading bidder for the U.S. assets of TikTok in the event that they become available.  Project Liberty, a decentralized social media offering, is making official what it calls a “deep partnership” with SOAR.com, a series of AI-powered data sharing and social networking portals created by Ancestry founder and serial entrepreneur Paul Allen.  Backed by real estate billionaire Frank McCourt to the tune of $500 million, Project Liberty involves creating a publicly accessible database of people’s social connections, a so-called Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP). The project also leverages cryptocurrency in the form of Frequency, part of the Polkadot ecosystem.  It’s hard to imagine how power could be any more concentrated than it currently is in the hands of social media platform owners like X's Elon Musk, suggesting now is an ideal opportunity for decentralized alternatives to attract new users.  Allen’s SOAR AI studio includes a Family Portal (an application he built originally on Facebook with 120 million users), which will use AI-powered transcription tech to log and store a universe of familial interactions. Also included is a Citizens Portal, an easily searchable local community government data service with over a million hours of transcripts and information from city, county and state meetings.  One of the main reasons Allen was attracted to Project Liberty is the promise given to users that they will forever remain in control of their data — a trust relationship that’s been abused in the case of Facebook and at Ancestry.com after he’d left the company, he said. This has to be done at the technology layer and not through some terms of service agreement that can be altered further down the line.  “Did we want this kind of an outcome with a few trillion dollar companies controlling the internet? Not really,” Allen said in an interview. “We have sovereign citizenship in the countries we live in. We must have sovereign citizenship in the future of the web, respecting our human rights in the digital world.”  Since establishing the Frequency blockchain, Project Liberty has recruited 1.3 million users. SOAR’s Family and Citizens will bring tens of millions more in the future, as people look for alternatives to existing all-powerful social media platforms, said Tomicah Tillemann, Project Liberty's president. As well as bringing decentralization it’s a chance “to do AI right,” he said.  Project Liberty is also a prospective bidderfor the U.S. version of Chinese-owned firm TikTok (the so-called “people’s bid”), should the firm be forced to sell to a U.S. owner.  Tillemann said there has been a lot of activity around the TikTok bid and commitments of tens of billions of capital to participate in the effort.  “We are widely regarded at this point as the leading bidder for the U.S. assets of TikTok in the event that they become available,” Tillemann said. “We are working with a wide array of stakeholders to ultimately bring TikTok and its 170 million U.S. users onto the same infrastructure that we're talking about in our partnership with the Frequency blockchain.”  Project Liberty will host its inaugural Summit on the Future of the Internet in Washington D.C. on Nov. 21-22.

Armstrong believes this initiative presents a unique opportunity to streamline the U.S. government, reduce bureaucracy, and promote economic freedom . Sharing his views on social media, he highlighted the potential for DOGE to address longstanding inefficiencies in federal spending. . @DOGE is a once in a lifetime opportunity to increase economic freedom in the U.S. and cut the size of government back to health. The founding fathers were geniuses but (with humility) may have missed the adverse incentives which grow the size of democratic government over… — Brian Armstrong (@brian_armstrong) November 17, 2024 During Trump’s campaign, he frequently emphasized the need to eliminate unnecessary government spending and reduce bloated structures. He also hinted that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would lead this new initiative, drawing significant public attention. A week after the election, Trump formally announced the creation of DOGE and confirmed Musk and Ramaswamy as its leaders. Their roles will likely focus on cutting excessive regulations, restructuring government agencies, and reducing overall expenses. Armstrong suggested bold measures for DOGE to consider, including capping government spending at 10% of GDP and penalizing lawmakers who approve unbalanced budgets by disqualifying them from re-election. He also proposed the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund , where U.S. citizens could receive dividends in the event of a budget surplus, aligning public interests with fiscal responsibility. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding DOGE , there are mixed reactions to its creation. Critics point out that DOGE is not an official federal department, which raises questions about its authority and scope. Under current federal laws, Congress holds the ultimate power over spending decisions. Nevertheless, DOGE has already sparked a debate about the need for systemic reforms to improve government efficiency. The announcement of DOGE has had ripple effects beyond politics, particularly in the cryptocurrency market. The meme coin Dogecoin, closely associated with Musk, has experienced a surge in popularity and value following the announcement. The increased media attention surrounding DOGE and Musk has fueled speculation about Dogecoin’s potential growth , with many viewing it as a symbolic representation of the initiative.

Despite the lack of significant price movement, the consistent ability to hold within this range underscores Bitcoin’s current strength and growing market confidence. Key data from CryptoQuant adds further optimism, revealing a notable reduction in selling pressure. The data indicates fewer sellers in the market, aligning with the broader bullish sentiment that has fueled Bitcoin’s recent momentum. With the supply side constrained, demand could propel BTC higher, reinforcing the strong price action seen over the weekend. Related Reading: Solana Breaks Above Key Resistance At $225 – ATH Next? This optimistic backdrop has sparked predictions of aggressive surges in the coming months as Bitcoin remains well-positioned to capitalize on favorable market dynamics. Analysts suggest that with selling pressure limited and demand continuing to grow, Bitcoin could be gearing up for its next significant breakout. Investors are watching closely to see if this strength will lead to a new phase of upward momentum, potentially pushing BTC into uncharted territory as the market anticipates the next major move in this bullish cycle. Bitcoin Flow To Exchanges Supports Bulls Bitcoin has had an exhilarating few weeks, surging 39% in just nine days and marking one of its most aggressive upward moves this cycle. The recent rally has left analysts and investors both excited and cautious as Bitcoin continues to show resilience above key levels. While many expect BTC to maintain its bullish trajectory, opportunities to buy at lower prices are becoming increasingly scarce. Data from CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler adds valuable insight into the current market dynamics. Adler notes that the average flow of Bitcoin to exchanges over the past 30 days has not surpassed the average volume over the last 365 days. This indicates a lack of significant selling pressure, suggesting that current holders are more inclined to retain their Bitcoin than sell into the rally. With fewer sellers in the market, Bitcoin’s price has the potential to climb further as demand increases. Related Reading: Last Chance To Buy Ethereum? Analyst Expects $6,000 Once It Breaks 8-Month Accumulation However, analysts agree that consolidation around the current price range would be a healthy step before the next leg up. Consolidation could allow the market to stabilize, attract fresh demand, and establish stronger support levels for the next growth phase. BTC Less Than 2% Away From ATH Bitcoin is trading at $91,700, just under 2% away from its all-time high (ATH) of $93,483. This proximity to record-breaking levels has fueled optimism among investors, with the price appearing poised to push above the ATH again this week. Bitcoin’s price action remains robust, supported by increasing demand and bullish sentiment in the market. The sustained strength of BTC’s price has been attributed to its ability to maintain key levels during periods of consolidation. This resilience indicates buyers continue to dominate, reinforcing the possibility of another breakout above the $93,483 mark. Analysts expect breaching this level would likely spark another wave of aggressive buying, potentially driving Bitcoin further into uncharted territory. Related Reading: XRP Breaks Above Multi-Year Resistance – Top Analyst Shares Price Target However, caution remains warranted. A breakdown below $87,000 would signal a retrace for Bitcoin, potentially initiating a short-term correction in the coming days.

42415509,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgcn,1731927223,Bitcoin's Correlation to U.S. Equities and Ether Weakens: Van Straten,"To the general populace, bitcoin is considered a risk-on asset due to its volatility and perceived correlation with U.S. equities.  In 2024, bitcoin and nasdaq have gone up or down together on the same day only 52% of the time.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the largest token by market capitalization, is currently around the $92,000 price mark, up over 115% year-to-date. At the same time, the total cryptocurrency market has just breached $3.025 trillion, a new all-time high according to the metric TOTAL on TradingView.  The market perceives bitcoin as a risk-on asset; one of the riskiest assets in the market, the higher the degree of risk, the further out on the risk curve the asset is.  Bitcoin has an implied volatility of approximately 60% over the past 30 days, according to Glassnode data. However, the implied volatility has come down from over 100% in 2021. If bitcoin is held correctly in self-custody the fundamental properties of bitcoin support the idea of no inherent counterparty risk with the asset.  As bitcoin is considered a risk-on asset, it tends to have a high correlation with U.S. equities, which are also a risk-on asset, but again, not as far on the risk curve as bitcoin.  Looking at TradingView data, on a 30-day correlation basis, over the past five years, bitcoin has experienced periods of 1:1 correlation with the Nasdaq Composite. This was very much the case for 2021 and 2022 when both assets rose together and fell together; some would say they were joined at the hip.  This trend continued into the first half of 2024, when bitcoin broke its all-time high, and went above $73,000 in March. However, since March, the Nasdaq has continued to make new all-time highs while bitcoin consolidated in a long-range between $50,000 and $70,000. But since Donald Trump won the U.S. election on Nov. 6, bitcoin has only continued to soar, while the nasdaq has stagnated.  The current 30-day correlation between the two assets is just 0.46, one of the lowest recorded levels in the past five years. While in September, we observed a negative correlation of almost -0.50.  Since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, bitcoin went on to make new highs above $93,000, while the Nasdaq also went on to make new all-time highs shortly after. However, the interesting part is the Nasdaq has fallen further away from its all-time high, of 4%, while bitcoin is just over 1.5% away from new highs.  Out of the 222 trading days so far in 2024, bitcoin CME futures (which trades five days a week) and the Nasdaq have either fallen or risen together just 52% of the time, according to data from Investing.com. However, three of the past four trading days have seen bitcoin rise while the Nasdaq has fallen. This may be a small sample size, but it is something to keep an eye on.  Fidelity data shows two charts. The chart on the left shows the sharp ratio of major asset classes over the past five years. A sharp ratio compares an investment's return with its risk; according to the data, bitcoin would be the best asset class in terms of performance against its risk.  Second is how major assets are correlated with the S&P 500; bitcoin has only a 19% correlation with SPX, a relatively small correlation.  The data implies that bitcoin will be correlated to risk-on assets at certain moments, especially in times of risk-on or risk-off. However, the data shows that over a long period of time, and especially in the back half of 2024, we are starting to see a divergence in the correlation between bitcoin and the Nasdaq.  As bitcoin becomes a larger asset class, now the seventh largest asset by market cap, it is expected to start to trade on its own as the market has a better understanding of the asset.  Bitcoin and ether's correlation weakens  This is also the case between the two largest tokens by market cap, bitcoin and ether {{ETH}}. Since 2019, ether and bitcoin have had a 1:1 correlation, with a brief dip in 2021, when ether soared beyond bitcoin during the bull market where bitcoin stagnated.

36503598,https://coinpaprika.com/news/polish-candidate-pledges-bitcoin-reserve-plan,1731926850,Polish Candidate Pledges Bitcoin Reserve Plan,"Polish presidential candidate Sławomir Mentzen has pledged to establish a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve if he wins the 2025 election, aiming to make Poland more crypto-friendly. Mentzen’s promise mirrors similar commitments made by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump during his campaign. On November 17, Mentzen responded to a query on X (formerly Twitter) from Lech Wilczynski, the CEO of crypto exchange Swap.ly. Wilczynski shared a model policy for a ""Strategic Bitcoin Reserve"" created by the Satoshi Action Fund, urging Mentzen to consider it. Mentzen confirmed his intention to create such a reserve , stating that Poland should not delay implementing the proposal. The draft policy calls for establishing a Bitcoin reserve as a hedge against economic instability, a move similar to initiatives in the U.S. and other nations. Wilczynski emphasized that creating a Bitcoin reserve should take priority over passing ""nonsense"" legislation on crypto assets . Mentzen, a rising political figure in Poland with significant support from libertarian and right-wing voters, has made crypto advocacy a key part of his campaign. Presidential elections in Poland are scheduled for May 2025, and Mentzen’s pro-crypto stance is expected to resonate with tech-savvy and financial reform-focused voters. Mentzen’s proposal aligns with similar initiatives in other countries . During his campaign, Trump promised to create a “Strategic Bitcoin Stockpile” for the U.S. Earlier this year, Senator Cynthia Lummis introduced legislation to establish a Bitcoin reserve in the U.S., aiming to acquire one million Bitcoin over five years. The proposal positions Bitcoin as a safeguard against national debt, with plans to hold the reserve for at least two decades. El Salvador set a precedent by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021. President Nayib Bukele’s government regularly accumulates Bitcoin, holding 5,748.8 BTC as of now. Similarly, Bhutan has been quietly mining Bitcoin for years, with reports suggesting the Kingdom holds approximately $780 million in digital assets. Mentzen’s pledge highlights the growing interest in Bitcoin as a strategic financial asset . As more nations explore Bitcoin reserves to hedge against economic challenges, Poland’s potential adoption could signal a broader shift in global attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. Whether Mentzen's promise will sway voters remains to be seen, but it underscores the increasing role of crypto in national politics.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/polish-candidate-pledges-bitcoin-reserve-plan,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36503598.jpeg

Located in Gyeonggi Province, Paju officials announced they are targeting 17 individuals who collectively owe 124 million Korean won (about $88,600), according to a report by Yonhap News on November 18. The city emphasized its determination to track down the crypto assets of tax evaders, stating that digital currencies cannot be used as a shield to avoid financial obligations. Officials vowed to enforce strict penalties on those trying to hide assets in crypto , highlighting the increasing use of cryptocurrencies to dodge debt collection in South Korea. This is not the first time Paju has targeted crypto holdings to recover taxes. Back in July, authorities confiscated crypto assets worth 100 million won (around $72,000) from tax defaulters. Officials revealed that some residents deliberately convert their funds into cryptocurrencies to avoid paying taxes, despite having the financial means to settle their debts. By seizing these assets , Paju aims to send a clear message against using crypto as a tool for tax evasion. Meanwhile, in a separate development, South Korea is exploring innovative uses for blockchain technology in tax management. NongHyup Bank recently partnered with digital asset platform Fireblocks to tokenize value-added tax (VAT) refunds. The project aims to create a prototype system using Fireblocks' tokenization engine , allowing real-time tracking of refunds while minimizing errors and fraud. Michael Shaulov, Fireblocks' CEO, explained that tokenizing VAT refunds could reduce operational costs and ensure transparency by creating an immutable digital record. The move is part of broader efforts in South Korea to integrate blockchain solutions into public services , enhancing trust between institutions and citizens. With these measures, South Korea continues to lead in both regulating cryptocurrencies and leveraging blockchain technology for governance .

This remarkable achievement, accomplished in just over a year, showcases Base’s rapid rise compared to networks like Bitcoin, which took over 15 years to reach similar numbers. However, the celebration was overshadowed by controversy surrounding an NFT commemorating the event. On November 15, Base announced the milestone, highlighting its position as one of the fastest-growing Ethereum Layer-2 solutions. The network’s growth has been driven by Coinbase's strong support , branding, and resources. Reports indicate that Base is now the second most popular blockchain in 2024, surpassing competitors like Optimism and Arbitrum. Interest in Base has surged ninefold compared to its closest rival, solidifying its dominance in the Layer-2 ecosystem. To mark the milestone, Base released a commemorative NFT. However, the design sparked accusations of plagiarism from digital artist Chris Biron, who alleged that the artwork copied his creation without giving him credit. Biron pointed out that Base had already earned over $36,000 from NFT sales at the time of his complaint. Biron criticized the network, noting the discrepancy between its corporate stature and its failure to acknowledge his work. Base responded swiftly to the backlash. Jesse Pollak, Base's lead developer, issued a public apology, acknowledging that the artwork unintentionally mirrored Biron’s design. Base admitted the mistake, pledged to donate all proceeds from the NFT sales to Biron, and promised to refine its processes to prevent similar issues in the future. The network stated, ""Creativity often draws from shared inspiration. While designing this piece, we unintentionally reflected another artist’s work without proper attribution. We’re sorry and will send 100% of the proceeds to Biron."" Biron expressed his gratitude for Base’s response , calling their actions a “class act” and commending the team for handling the matter respectfully. Despite the controversy, Base’s accomplishment of reaching 1 billion transactions underscores its rapid expansion and significant role in the crypto ecosystem.

Kusama made the assertion while responding to a SHIB enthusiast who recommended that the Shiba Inu ecosystem team adopt Litecoin’s humorous marketing strategy. For context, Litecoin’s X handle recently became active, posting memes and humor to attract the attention of crypto enthusiasts. Litecoin, which jokingly hinted at plans to transition to a memecoin due to current market conditions, stated that its new slogan would be: “Take the L.” This triggered a reaction from Kusama, who described the move as hilarious. Following his reaction, Shiba Inu community figure Jolt noted that Litecoin’s marketing strategy is effective. The user recounted how the Shiba Inu ecosystem team engaged the community with humor and sh*tposting during its early days. Jolt suggested that the Shiba Inu team consider adopting its previous marketing strategy, which attracted a broad audience. Shiba Inu Uses Community-Driven Marketing Approach Kusama acknowledged Jolt’s comments, emphasizing that he is actively listening and planning Shiba Inu’s future strategies. The Shiba Inu leader pointed out that while some changes can be implemented immediately, others could take time. He indicated that Shiba Inu utilizes a community-driven marketing approach and added that the upcoming DAO will allow SHIBArmy to have a say in crucial decision-making, including marketing. SHIB No Longer Competing with Memecoins, But XRP and CardanoFurthermore, Kusama noted that Shiba Inu is no longer competing with memecoins, including Litecoin, which jokingly announced its meme transition. According to him, Shiba Inu is now in competition with ‘OG’ assets like XRP and Cardano, emphasizing the need to break into the legacy market using professional marketing tactics. To compete at this level, the Shiba Inu lead suggested that there must be a balance, hinting at a combination of entertaining marketing with professional strategy, which supports widespread adoption. Kusama added that Shiba Inu could not use the same marketing strategy suitable for projects within the $6 billion market cap range to compete effectively in the $50 billion region. However, he stated that the ecosystem team would adopt any marketing strategy the community recommends through the DAO. He promised to share more details about Shiba Inu’s marketing approach, which could help SHIB compete with XRP and Cardano. Although Shiba Inu launched as a memecoin in 2020, Kusama believes that the cryptocurrency has transitioned to a utility token, thanks to the multiple projects launched over the years, including games and an L2 blockchain. As a result, Kusama thinks Shiba Inu is up against XRP and Cardano, not memecoins. While SHIB has a market cap of $15.09 billion, Cardano and XRP are valued at $27.12 billion and $65.34 billion, respectively.",POSITIVE,ADA | SHIB | XRP,ADA | LTC | MARKET | SHIB | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/shiba-inu-lead-says-shib-is-up-against-cardano-and-xrp-not-memecoins/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shiba-inu-lead-says-shib-is-up-against-cardano-and-xrp-not-memecoins,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

36511672,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101785,1731923786,Analyst Sets Next Short-Term XRP Target at $2.82: Here are Support and Resistance Levels to Watch,"Following the rally above the 1-dollar value last week, XRP has maintained it as support, leading to projections of further upside. Notably, amid the ongoing bull market run, XRP has reclaimed the $1 mark for the first time in nearly three years. This milestone came on the back of an impressive 100% surge last week. The rally saw XRP reach a peak of $1.265 over the weekend before retracing slightly. The asset has since consolidated, holding firmly above $1 despite the pullback, as it currently trades at $1.175. Analysts are now charting the next potential moves.SBZung Identifies $2.82 as Next TargetAs XRP held above $1, market analyst SBZung shared a short-term chart yesterday, outlining a potential path forward. Notably, XRP reclaimed the $1.04835 level after briefly losing it, showing sustenance of the bullish momentum. Interestingly, the chart indicates Fibonacci retracement levels as key support and resistance zones, with $1.04835 acting as a crucial reclaim point. The current upward trajectory is bolstered by XRP holding firmly at major support levels . SBZung on X However, SBZung identified the zone at $1.06919 as an important level to hold for a continued rally, which XRP had given up at the time. He noted that if XRP reclaims and stays above this level, there could be a 160% move to $2.82. The market analyst acknowledged the possibility of XRP collapsing to the $0.8735 level if its support levels above $1 fail to hold. Nonetheless, this is unlikely to occur as long as the current momentum holds firm. Following SBZung’s analysis, XRP has now reclaimed $1.06919.Other Major XRP Levels to WatchMeanwhile, CryptOpus, another prominent market watcher, identified $0.7941 and $0.9272 as additional key support levels. CryptOpus on X The analyst outlined potential upward targets at $1.6569, $2.0374, and $2.4169, respectively corresponding to 80%, 120%, and 160% gains. This aligns with SBZung’s bullish outlook, although CryptOpus presents a gradual progression toward higher price points. Further, market watcher Leb Crypto identified a confirmed breakout from a multi-year consolidation phase following the latest upsurge beyond the $1 region . Remarkably, this breakout represents an important shift in XRP’s market structure.https://twitter.com/leb_crypto/status/1858094729562325231The analyst also stressed the importance of $0.94 as a key support level, which must hold for the rally to continue. Leb Crypto identifies $1.6 and $1.96 as the next resistance levels XRP must overcome. This supports the idea that XRP is currently in a transformative phase. On-Chain Data Confirms Large Buy VolumesIn addition, on-chain researcher Tokenicer also discussed the strength of the $1 level as a support zone. Citing on-chain data, he confirmed that this zone is bolstered by large buy orders, including $1.15 million at $1 and $1.06 million at $1.01. Tokenicer also noted that XRP’s recent rally was capped by a $3 million sell wall at $1.3. Despite this resistance, the overall momentum remains favorable. The on-chain data suggests that $1 is now a psychological support level, providing a foundation for further upward movement. https://twitter.com/Tokenicer/status/1858269468176375912All these analysts generally agree that the current support zones are around $0.94, $1, and $1.06919, while resistance levels to watch are $1.6, $1.96, and $2.82.

36501829,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-markets-brace-for-key-us-economic-data,1731923729,Crypto Markets Brace for Key US Economic Data,"This week, several key U.S. economic events could shape the cryptocurrency market, creating potential volatility as traders and investors respond to fresh data. Positive news could strengthen market confidence and support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins linked to specific sectors. Bitcoin currently holds above a critical psychological threshold, reflecting robust market interest. Upcoming data, including jobless claims, purchasing managers’ indexes (PMIs), and corporate earnings, are in focus for their potential impact on sentiment. The U.S. Department of Labor is set to release weekly jobless claims data on Thursday, providing a snapshot of the labor market’s health. Last week, claims totaled 217,000, better than expected and lower than the previous week’s figure. Fewer claims signal a resilient labor market , which may encourage consumer spending and investment. A healthy job market often leads to higher disposable income, which could flow into assets like Bitcoin, boosting demand and prices. On Friday, the S&P Global Manufacturing and Services PMIs for November will shed light on the performance of the U.S. economy’s industrial and service sectors. Manufacturing PMI is forecast to tick up slightly from the previous reading of 48.5. A rise in this metric indicates improving activity in the manufacturing sector, a positive sign for economic growth. Likewise, the Services PMI, which previously stood at 54.1, reflects the health of critical service industries. Strong PMI readings could uplift investor sentiment , pushing risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies higher as confidence in economic stability grows. Another pivotal event this week is Nvidia’s earnings report, due Wednesday. Nvidia has a significant influence on the crypto market due to its role in GPU production, crucial for AI and crypto mining. Analysts expect a massive revenue increase driven by demand for AI infrastructure, with projections of an 84% rise to $33.28 billion. AI-focused cryptocurrencies like Render ( RNDR ) and Worldcoin ( WLD ) could gain momentum if Nvidia delivers strong results, signaling robust growth in AI and crypto applications. Additionally, Nvidia’s ongoing shareholder lawsuit concerning its crypto mining revenue disclosures adds a layer of uncertainty, potentially fueling volatility in related markets. Overall, these events highlight how economic indicators and corporate developments interplay with the crypto market, setting the stage for dynamic movements as traders react to evolving conditions.",POSITIVE,BTC | WLD,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | WLD,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/crypto-markets-brace-for-key-us-economic-data,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/36501829.jpeg

In a recent post on X, Carl, Forbes 30 under 30 and also Seen On FOX and CNBC, boldly declared that he would not cash out of his Shiba Inu holdings until the price of SHIB reaches ""at least"" $0.50. A major factor influencing this outlook is SHIB's historical performance, particularly in 2021.Carl is anticipating that Shiba Inu will repeat its past performance. According to him, if the asset gains any upward momentum soon, it could surge toward the $0.50 mark. Shiba Inu chart by Carl Community ReactsCarl's post quickly gained traction, with the crypto community debating the implications of such a bold prediction for Shiba Inu.Some analysts, like Ether NasyonaL, have questioned the feasibility of Shiba Inu reaching $0.50, while others, like Sweep, have expressed strong conviction in Carl's prediction. Community reaction On the other hand, some critics have suggested that waiting for Shiba Inu to hit $0.50 is akin to holding the asset until it reaches zero, implying they see no future for the meme token. Essentially, market reactions to Carl's $0.50 SHIB price target have been mixed.What Shiba Inu at $0.50 MeansFor context, Shiba Inu is currently trading at $0.00002541, with four leading zeros. Essentially, Carl is projecting a future where Shiba Inu no longer has any leading zeros and is worth half a dollar. To reach this milestone, SHIB would need to increase in value by nearly 20,000 times, or 1,967,629%.For instance, an investor who puts $100 into SHIB today could see their portfolio balloon to $1,967,629 in the hypothetical future, where SHIB’s value reaches $0.50.As a result, current Shiba Inu millionaires could see their status elevated to SHIB billionaires. Moreover, at a $0.50 price point, Shiba Inu would command a staggering market cap of approximately $294.5 trillion. This projection assumes the circulating supply of SHIB remains constant, with no significant burns.Suppose Shiba Inu alone could achieve a market cap of $294.5 trillion, it raises the question of what the market caps of Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies might look like in comparison. Interestingly, despite its ambitious nature, prediction platforms like Telegaon have set a 2050 target for Shiba Inu to reach $0.50 potentially.",NEUTRAL,SHIB,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/top-investor-says-he-is-not-selling-shiba-inu-until-shib-soars-1967629-to-0-50/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-investor-says-he-is-not-selling-shiba-inu-until-shib-soars-1967629-to-0-50,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin made a strong rebound today following a bearish weekend during which its price revisited the $87K price range. Now trading at $91,612, the cryptocurrency is just 1.84% below its all-time high.However, notable activity among long-dormant Bitcoin wallets has emerged alongside this resurgence. These movements have sparked interest, as several large holders, or whales, are transferring significant amounts of BTC to exchanges, potentially signaling selling intent.Dormant Bitcoin Wallets Show Increased ActivityOn-chain data highlights a sharp increase in the activation of dormant Bitcoin wallets. According to Spot on Chain, a wallet that held 400 BTC, worth $2,091 at acquisition and now valued at $35.8 million, became active today after 12 years. Essentially, this Bitcoin investor awakens to a staggering 171,109% return on investment amid BTC's rebound.This wallet and two others moved 200 BTC to the Bitstamp crypto exchange and transferred 351 BTC to a new address. In total, these wallets deposited 600 BTC, worth $46 million, to Bitstamp over the past month. Each of these wallets had been inactive for more than a decade. Analysis by Spot On Chain Similarly, Whale Alert reported that another dormant address containing 246 BTC, valued at over $22 million, was activated after 11.7 years. Satoshi-Era Wallets ResurfaceA separate event involved a Satoshi-era wallet, which was inactive since 2010, moving 2,000 BTC to Coinbase. This transaction, valued at approximately $180 million, is significant due to its historical context. The wallet holder had mined Bitcoin when its price was less than 10 cents, highlighting the coin’s exponential growth. Additionally, in September, a wallet that had been dormant for over 15 years moved 250 BTC mined in 2009. Similarly, in August, another long-inactive wallet from 2014 transferred 174 BTC, worth $10 million at the time. Optimism Amid Whale ActivityDespite the increase in whale activity, market sentiment remains largely unaffected. Industry figures, including Michael Saylor, predict continued bullish momentum. Saylor recently projected that Bitcoin could surpass $100,000 by year’s end. He attributed this outlook to institutional backing, political changes, and reduced market risks.Saylor emphasized Bitcoin’s growing credibility on Wall Street, with firms like BlackRock enhancing its value proposition. He also pointed to the pro-business stance of recent U.S. policies, which he believes will further support the cryptocurrency market.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/legendary-bitcoin-investor-awakes-to-171109-roi-as-btc-rebounds-to-91k-moves-funds-to-exchange/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=legendary-bitcoin-investor-awakes-to-171109-roi-as-btc-rebounds-to-91k-moves-funds-to-exchange,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Hoskinson stated that the conversations to create a working cryptocurrency regulatory framework in the United States have gained momentum. In a November 17 “Surprise AMA,” he disclosed his latest contacts with the government and notable crypto industry leaders, outlining what the sector aims to achieve ultimately.Hoskinson Reveals Contact with Lawmakers, Crypto LeadersIn the podcast , Hoskinson disclosed his active engagement with US lawmakers to discuss crypto regulation. He stated he has had meetings with senators and policymakers, fronting the need to create a working guideline for the industry to them.The founder also noted he would see how things come together in the next 60-90 days but remains optimistic for positive outcomes. Notably, the timeframe correlates with Donald Trump’s inauguration period, confirming his earlier assertions that things would get more intense when the pro-crypto President-elect assumes power.Hoskinson also disclosed alliances with key industry leaders, whom he noted were “great partners” in his crypto regulatory push. The founder revealed conversing with Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and his attempts to contact Hedera’s co-founder Leemon Baird to help foster the clarity charge.Cardano Founder’s Regulatory StrategyMeanwhile, Hoskinson noted that the team is weighing its regulatory options on all fronts. He stated that they are considering pushing the policy charge through administrative changes, executive orders, and lawmaking.He also insisted they want to create a crypto regulatory policy that outperforms those in other countries. The Cardano founder noted that they would study digital asset models from Switzerland, Singapore , and the United Arab Emirates, and create policies that would make America the “global leader in cryptocurrency.”Furthermore, Hoskinson maintained that the US crypto policy will address pressing issues around asset classification. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has had a series of fallouts with crypto firms, brandishing assets like XRP , Solana, and Cardano as securities.As a result, Hoskinson noted that specific bills and regulatory guidelines clarifying these misconceptions would be implemented. Consequently, the issue of regulatory overreach and regulation by enforcement would be in the past.Hoskinson also mentioned that the crypto policy would cover custody standards, tax clarity, and consumer protection, ultimately attracting global digital asset firms to the US. He asserted that the regulatory clarity would create a multi-trillion-dollar crypto industry on American soil and allow enthusiasts to use digital assets ""the way we want to.”Cardano Founder Debunks JRE AppearanceMeanwhile, the Cardano founder has debunked speculations that he would appear on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

36500896,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653618,1731922220,"Bitstamp Just ‘Rug Pulled’ The XRP Community, Claims XPMarket CEO","Dr. Artur Kirjakulov, CEO and founder of XPMarket, has publicly accused Bitstamp of executing a “rug pull” against the XRP community. This serious allegation has ignited a contentious debate among industry stakeholders, raising questions about the stability and reliability of Bitstamp’s involvement in XRPL-based financial instruments. Has Bitstamp Rug Pulled The XRP Community? On Sunday, November 17, Dr. Kirjakulov took to X to voice his concerns regarding Bitstamp’s recent actions. “Bitstamp literally has just rug pulled XRPL community,” he claimed and asserted that Bitstamp had “withdrew more than 90% of liquidity from USD/XRP and BTC/XRP AMM Pools,” a move he characterized as a “silent” and unannounced maneuver that has left the XRPL community in a precarious position. According to Kirjakulov, the absence of any formal statement from Bitstamp or RippleX exacerbates the uncertainty surrounding this liquidity withdrawal, potentially leading to “extremely volatile” trading conditions and significant price impacts for these asset pairs. Dr. Kirjakulov further highlighted the intricate relationship between Ripple and Bitstamp, noting that “Ripple owns an equity share in Bitstamp.” This connection suggests that Ripple’s stake in Bitstamp may influence the exchange’s strategic decisions within the XRPL space. The CEO of XPMarket expressed deep concerns about the assurance of a 1:1 conversion rate for Bitstamp-issued wrapped assets, drawing a parallel to the Stably incident where such guarantees were not honored. He emphasized, “How can anyone trust DeFi on XRPL, when official partners make such moves? Optics are terrible.” Related Reading: XRP Primed For $100 Price Target – Here’s Why The allegations did not go unnoticed within the XRPL community. Daniel Keller, CTO at Eminence and an XRPL ambassador, responded with skepticism regarding the authenticity of Kirjakulov’s claims. Keller questioned the legitimacy of the accounts associated with the liquidity pools, stating, “Do we know that’s an official Bitstamp account? Looking back on the activation sequence it was activated via Binance, which is weird if Bitstamp runs it.” In response, Dr. Kirjakulov maintained that the accounts in question were indeed affiliated with Bitstamp. He clarified, “Going through the accounts it is visible that they are clearly associated with Bitstamp, because they are also market making these tokens. There is literally no one else interested here in market making these tokens, because they are niche and unpopular.” He further explained that the liquidity had been pulled back to a market-making (MM) account, reinforcing his assertion of Bitstamp’s direct involvement. Kirjakulov also dismissed the significance of activation accounts, noting, “Activation account does not mean anything. I activate my account from multiple exchanges specifically to make less traceable.” Related Reading: XRP Climbs Above $1, Fibonacci Levels Reveal More Gains Ahead Keller pressed for more concrete evidence to support the claims. He asked: “Can you share some of these connecting transactions because if you already looked them up it would be cool to share. An activation account is very important if you are an exchange supporting an LP, because you want people to know it’s your company. Dr. Kirjakulov responded by emphasizing the strength of the circumstantial evidence pointing towards Bitstamp, stating, “Circumstantial evidence? Yes. But this evidence points rather clearly into Bitstamp, as no one else has such a huge amount of these assets issued by them, other than someone affiliated by them. And circumstantial evidence is no excuse to ignore them.” The discourse extended to the topic of Bitstamp’s IOU services. Michael Nardolillo, a user on X, defended Bitstamp by highlighting its regulated status and the redeemability of its IOUs. He argued, “There’s no guarantee Bitstamp will honor their IOUs?! That’s like saying there’s no guarantee you can withdraw your crypto from an exchange. Bitstamp is highly regulated, IOUs are always redeemable they are no different than holding an asset on an exchange.” This defense was met with skepticism from Kirjakulov, who drew attention to past failures in the industry. He countered, “Somewhere FTX creditors did a few facepalms. Again, Stably did not honor 1:1 conversion. And there is nothing on Bitstamp or even GateHub sources to claim there will be 1:1 conversion and absolutely nothing of proof of funds.” In an attempt to substantiate his defense, Nardolillo shared a screenshot from Bitstamp’s website detailing their IOU service. The screenshot outlines that users can transfer value on the XRP Ledger through IOUs issued by Bitstamp in exchange for real assets like BTC, USD, EUR, or ETH. Dr. Kirjakulov highlighted a critical oversight in this arrangement. He stated, “And this is the problem. This is the only way how you can make this swap. Also, it says absolutely nothing about 1:1 conversion. What if it depegs by 50%? Will they make 1 bUSD (which is worth 50 cents) swap to 1 USDT (which is worth 1 USD)?” As of press time, the XRP community awaits an official response from Bitstamp. XRP traded at $1.15.

42415506,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgau,1731921506,Bitcoin Near a Record High Might Be Just Half the Journey as BCA Research Signals $200K,"Despite bitcoin's recent surge, one analysis shows the price might rise as high as $200,000.  A gauge based on 260-day fractal patterns is not even close to the levels seen at previous bull market peaks, BCA Research said in a note Thursday.  While bitcoin {{BTC}} is still hovering below the six-figure mark, one firm is confidently predicting the price could more than double from the current market rate of $90,000.  Yes, you read that right. According to BCA Research, bitcoin's ultimate target could be more than $200,000.  The prediction is based on bitcoin's ""260-day fractal dimension complexity,"" a measure of the patterns that appear in bitcoin's price changes. The metric remains well above 1.20, a threshold that has signaled bull market peaks when the reading is lower. BCA Research suggests that this time a drop below that level could correspond to prices exceeding $200,000.  The gauge measures the complexity of the price changes over 260 days. It is a signal based on the quantification of the dimensionalities of fractals, which are patterns that appear at various scales and are often observed in nature and mathematics. In financial markets, fractal analysis identifies recurring patterns and informs predictions.  A higher fractal dimension complexity means difficulty interpreting price trends, making market movements more unpredictable. A declining reading suggests that price patterns are becoming more predictable and stable. Low readings can represent complacency in the market, a false sense of security among traders that prices could continue to move in a particular direction. Such a situation is usually seen at bull market tops.  ""Despite bitcoin's election-fueled rally, its 260-day complexity is not yet close to the 1.2 level that would signal the start of another crypto winter,"" the BCA Research team led by Chief Strategist Dhaval Joshi said in a Nov. 14 note to clients. ""Hence, while we should expect a near-term retracement, bitcoin's structural uptrend is intact with an ultimate destination of $200,000+.""  The team said the value of bitcoin's network effect has substantial upside and as global wealth rises, the value of the network effect of both gold and bitcoin will also increase.  ""In the case of both gold and bitcoin, their network effect comes from the collective belief that they are the non-confiscable assets to own in a fiat monetary system. And that certain portion of total wealth must be held in these non-confiscable assets as an insurance against hyperinflation, banking system failure, or state expropriation.""",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/18/bitcoin-near-a-record-high-might-be-just-half-the-journey-as-bca-research-signals-200k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c6713872a327e56c0fdf8e5aca47f576c500c255-5435x3623.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36511665,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101814,1731917755,Analyst Says Dogecoin Has Way More Room to Grow as Market Cap Is No Limitation,"Prominent crypto chartist Ali Martinez expresses confidence in the growth potential for Dogecoin, suggesting DOGE's popularity is still far from its 2021 peak. Dogecoin had an impressive rally earlier this month amid Elon Musk’s indirect endorsement of the asset through his mention of D.O.G.E (the Department of Government Efficiency). This caused the price of DOGE to surge over 100% to $0.4359.However, like other major crypto assets, Dogecoin’s price plunged shortly after, dropping below the $0.4 mark and falling to around $0.35. Following this decline, some critics suggested that the token would not experience another price surge.According to Martinez, these critics cite factors such as better memes and market cap limitations as possible reasons Dogecoin may not embark on another rally.Dogecoin Still Far from Its 2021 Interest Reacting, Martinez emphasized that despite Dogecoin’s recent rally, the meme coin is still far from the popularity level it attained in 2021. He supported this claim with a chart showing Dogecoin’s price action and corresponding Google Trends’ interest in a 7-day timeframe. https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1858174255495807099According to the data, the price of Dogecoin rises alongside its interest over time in 2021. For instance, when DOGE’s popularity surged to 53 from January 24 - 30, 2021, the token’s price also rose to around $0.014. Three months later, according to the data cited by Martinez, Dogecoin's popularity increased to 73, corresponding with a price surge to $0.05. The chart suggested that Dogecoin surged to its all-time high of $0.7376 in May 2021, when its interest over time peaked at 100. Notably, Martinez indicated that Dogecoin’s recent surge occurred without the asset attaining its peak popularity, as witnessed in 2021. Per the chart, Dogecoin’s popularity was less than 50 when it surged over 100% to $0.4759 earlier this month. He suggested that Dogecoin still has enormous room for growth if its popularity reaches the levels observed in 2021. “DOGE has waaay more room to grow,” Martinez said while encouraging investors to not relent in their HODL conviction.Dogecoin’s popularity level currently stands at 18, as the asset continues to trade around the $0.37 territory. Priced at $0.3749, Dogecoin is up 4.39% in the past day and 33.45% over the past week.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/analyst-says-dogecoin-has-way-more-room-to-grow-as-market-cap-is-no-limitation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=analyst-says-dogecoin-has-way-more-room-to-grow-as-market-cap-is-no-limitation,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Bitcoin Memecoins Could Be Next to Watch,"Memecoins like PUPS, DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON, and BILLION•DOLLAR•CAT are becoming popular beta bets for Bitcoin's growth.  The Runes protocol, which facilitates the creation of fungible tokens directly on Bitcoin using its UTXO model, has overtaken BRC-20 in market capitalization.  Memecoins serve as a speculative asset during times of low volatility in other crypto sectors.  Bitcoin-based memecoins are gaining traction among some crypto traders on X as a beta bet on bitcoin (BTC) amid its surge to lifetime peaks, making the sector a hot narrative to watch for everyday traders.  Tokens such as PUPS, DOG•GO•TO•THE•MOON (DOG), BILLION•DOLLAR•CAT (BDC), MEME, among others, have gained as much as 35% in the past 24 hours to lead gains among all tracked categories, CoinGecko data shows. Smaller tokens such as CYPHER•GENESIS (CYPHER) has risen over 77%.  The market capitalization of Runes tokens, the protocol that supports these assets, have flipped BRC-20 (another Bitcoin-based protocol) in the past 24 hours, data shows.  Such moves came as BTC added more than 30% in the past 30 days on the back of Republican Donald Trump’s presidential election, boosting sentiment and growth across the sector for his pro-crypto stance.  Runes were created earlier in 2024 to facilitate the creation and management of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. Runes allow users to create fungible tokens, which are interchangeable digital assets similar to how Bitcoin itself or Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens function.  These utilize Bitcoin's Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) model. Each UTXO can hold any amount of various Runes, making the management of tokens more aligned with Bitcoin's native structure, potentially reducing network congestion caused by ""junk"" UTXOs from other token standards like BRC-20.  Data, however, show no uptick in Runes protocol on chain metrics as of Monday. Onchain metrics typically follow social activity and narratives, with prices leading afterward.  Beta bets are a way to gain exposure to a network, ecosystem or asset using related tokens. Since early 2023, memecoins have emerged as the preferred beta asset for various ecosystems, such as Ethereum or Solana, which has contributed to their appeal among investors.  Interest in memecoins generally comes amid low market volatility in more serious crypto sectors, such as layer-2s or storage, and rising negative sentiment around tokens backed by venture capital funds – which are increasingly perceived as overpriced and a bad bet for retail traders.  The focus on meme coins to bet on growth isn't unique to Bitcoin. Several Solana-based meme coin tokens surged from December 2023 to March as the network’s SOL tokens took off – contributing to ecosystem growth and attention — while fuelling the mothership’s prices.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/18/missed-btc-rally-to-93k-bitcoin-memecoins-could-be-next-to-watch,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ec42862086a9b35e22a6a2f7d9aad390d8948435-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

36499557,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=653621,1731916807,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Ready To Roar! Analyst Calls For A 200% Spike,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) appears to be on the brink of a surge, as crypto analysts predict that the token could experience a 200% increase. Related Reading: Mantra (OM) Hits New ATH On 132% Weekly Surge – Details SHIB has begun to catch up to the meme coin frenzy that has seized the crypto market, as evidenced by a 20% gain over the past week and an 7% increase in the past 24 hours. Shiba Inu’s community remains optimistic about the future, despite the fact that its performance still falls short of Dogecoin (DOGE), which has experienced an 30% increase in a week. According to the crypto analyst Roaring Kitty, the latest momentum of SHIB is actually a “warm-up rally” since it resembles anything seen yet in the context of meme coin price hikes. In his opinion, the basis for an explosive upward movement is currently being laid down, and retail investors are to be credited with the boost. Examining Shiba Inu’s Recent Price Action SHIB’s price performance has demonstrated resilience. In late September, it emerged from a protracted downward trend and surged beyond $0.00002150, only to retrace to $0.00001553. The token reached its highest level in seven months, $0.0000303, this month, before ultimately stabilizing in the $0.00002 range. The current memecoin PA is typical of what we’ve seen before on previous Coinbase listings, take the $SHIB example below: – Warm up pump of 100-200% – Consolidates/dips for a week – Retail frenzy kicks in immediately with a massive +200% green weekly candle Keep holding. pic.twitter.com/Kb5R1cbGGf — Crypto Kitty 💹🧲 (@RoaringKitty) November 15, 2024 According to Roaring Kitty, before meme coins enter their parabolic phase, they show this back-and-forth price movement. His research is able to illustrate how SHIB could break above $0.00015 in a retail-driven mania if the cryptocurrency removes a zero from its price. Additionally, trading volumes have increased, indicating heightened interest and establishing the foundation for a more robust upward movement. Promising Long-Term Prospects SHIB’s long-term prospects are equally optimistic, in addition to its immediate successes. Analysts anticipate a 107% price increase in the next six months, with a stabilization of growth at 83% within a year. This optimism is founded on SHIB’s capacity to remain a focal point in the meme coin ecosystem, its ongoing development efforts, and its active community. Nevertheless, this optimistic outlook is not without its limitations. It will be imperative for SHIB to breach critical resistance levels in order to maintain any rally. Additionally, analysts caution that the token’s performance may be influenced by macroeconomic factors and broader market conditions. Related Reading: Whale Alert: XRP Accumulation Reaches 5-Year Peak – Details The Future of Shiba Inu Holders Shiba Inu’s recent price moves and forecasts have rekindled the community. However, SHIB leaves open the question of whether it can sustain its momentum and deliver on such lofty projections as hype continues to rise. For now, at least, the buy call appears pretty straightforward: hold tight and watch for market signals. After all, the upside potential is huge. But be ready for a breakout, for example, if enthusiasm among retail investors becomes too much to handle. It is, however, of the essence to know the risks as such an investment entails.

36511664,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=101800,1731916183,XRP ATH on Cards as Google XRP Search Interest Soars to All-Time High,"Google search interest in XRP is now at an all-time high, coinciding with the asset's spectacular price surge to three-year highs. According to data from Google Trends, the search interest for XRP reached a peak popularity score of 100 on November 16. Just eight days earlier, however, search interest was at a mere 8, indicating a lack of public enthusiasm for the token.Over the past year, search interest in XRP has been relatively low, with scores hovering below 27 since November 2023. However, in a sudden shift, the trend reversed, and public interest in XRP skyrocketed between November 15 and 16, reaching an all-time high. Search interest in XRP | Google Trends The last time a comparable spike in search interest occurred for XRP was between April 11 and 17, 2021, when XRP reached a cycle peak of $1.96.Why Google Search Interest in XRP PeakedThe latest surge in search interest for XRP coincided with the start of a long-awaited bull run. On Friday, XRP traded at a low of $0.7726, which was one of its highest values of the year at the time.By Saturday, XRP gained even more momentum, breaking into the $1 range and peaking at $1.2679. This represented a massive 24-hour increase of 64%. XRP had not traded at this level since November 11, 2021, exactly three years ago.Over the past three years, XRP’s price has steadily declined, bottoming out at $0.2906 in June 2022. Despite winning its lawsuit against the SEC , XRP struggled to break the $1 mark and even dropped to $0.38 earlier this year.This prolonged price stagnation frustrated holders, but a significant turnaround occurred last week. As a result, public interest surged, with market participants rushing in (FOMO) to buy XRP. Regions with the Most Interest in XRPGoogle data reveals that global interest in XRP is fairly uniform, though certain regions are particularly active. These include Australia, Canada, South Africa, the U.S., and Russia. Regions searching for XRP Since XRP recaptured the $1 mark over the weekend, its price has remained above that threshold despite pullbacks. At press time, XRP is trading at $1.18, up 16% in the last 24 hours and a more impressive 104% over the past week.Factors That Contributed to XRP’s Weekend SurgeA key factor driving XRP’s bull run last week was the accumulation of XRP by large investors, or ""whales."" According to Santiment, investors holding between 1 million and 100 million XRP tokens deployed $526 million in fresh capital to accumulate more XRP over the past week.XRP on Track to ATHInterestingly, while whales were accumulating, many retail investors sold their holdings, assuming the XRP bull run would lose momentum quickly—as has often been the case in the past. However, the trend has continued, sparking a wave of FOMO and driving XRP’s price even higher. With increased interest in XRP, market analysts are confident the asset is on track to establish a new all-time high after nearly seven years of trading below its $3.84 peak.According to conservative estimates, XRP could realistically reach between $5 and $10 , while ambitious estimates suggest as high as $300.",POSITIVE,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/xrp-ath-on-cards-as-google-xrp-search-interest-soars-to-all-time-high/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-ath-on-cards-as-google-xrp-search-interest-soars-to-all-time-high,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

42415495,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJgTz,1731915000,"Kraken, Tether-Backed Dutch Firm Rolls Out MiCA-Compliant Euro, U.S. Dollar Stablecoins","As stablecoins gain traction, Netherlands-based fintech firm Quantoz aims to take a slice of the European market.  The company will issue the regulatory-compliant stablecoins pegged to the euro (EURQ) and U.S. dollar (USDQ) on the Ethereum blockchain. The tokens are fully backed by fiat reserves and highly-liquid financial instruments like government bonds, the firm said on Monday.  The firm has obtained the Electronic Money Institution (EMI) license from the Dutch Central Bank, a necessary requirement for stablecoin issuers to operate in the EU. Quantoz has secured investments from venture capital firm Fabric Ventures, crypto exchange Kraken and stablecoin behemoth Tether, though it didn't disclose the size of the fundraising round.  EURQ and USDQ will first be listed on Bitfinex and Kraken and available for trading to eligible users starting Thursday.  Stablecoins, are tokens pegged to fiat currencies, have grown to a $180 billion asset class within cryptocurrencies and are a key piece of infrastructure for the digital asset market. They serve as liquidity to buy and sell crypto on exchanges, and are getting increasingly popular for everyday payments and remittances due to cheaper and faster settlements on blockchains compared to traditional banking rails.  Quantoz's rollout comes at a time as crypto businesses in the EU are in crunch time before region-wide rules (MiCA) to operate within the trading bloc will enter into full force by the end of this year. MiCA requires stablecoin issuers to get compliant or potentially retreat from the market of 450 million consumers as regulated players such as exchanges delist unauthorized tokens. While Circle, the company behind the $36 billion market cap USDC, said that it fulfilled the requirements to operate in the region Tether has been a vocal critic of the new rules and is yet to obtain the necessary licensing.  ""There's a gap in the stablecoin market here in Europe, and we see that as an opportunity,"" Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO of the firm's payments-focused subsidiary Quantoz Payments, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""We are confident that our tech and regulatory compliance put us in a good position to fill that gap, especially now that we have strong partners like Kraken and Tether.""  Stablecoins can be impactful in areas where traditional banking infrastructure falls short, such as high-volume, low-value transactions, Busmann said. ""Imagine being able to move cash in and out of money market funds without the traditional delays of T+1 or T+2 days.""  Quantoz also has a tokenization business, a red-hot trend in crypto of creating digital versions of traditional financial instruments such as bonds. Tokenized assets combined with stablecoins can also offer a more efficient way for businesses and institutions to manage their treasury, thanks to their near-instantaneous settlement instead of one or two days of delay, he explained.  ""We are building an ecosystem that can support a wide range of use cases, from everyday payments to more complex financial transactions,"" Busmann said.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2024/11/18/kraken-tether-backed-dutch-firm-rolls-out-mica-compliant-euro-us-dollar-stablecoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d2053e81100e9bf71d5509e85df1acd32751f6ab-714x402.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Amid a broader market consolidation after a bullish outbreak, which saw Bitcoin break the $93,000 price, XRP defied the prevailing momentum. The sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap surged a whopping 105% in the past seven days to finally cross $1 .XRP's bullish upswing also ensured it overtook Dogecoin in the crypto rankings after a price upsurge from the meme coin saw it trump the asset earlier in the month. Notably, XRP now trades at a market cap above $65 billion, its largest in three years.Highest Weekly Close Since 2021Meanwhile, market analyst Cryptoes drew the XRP community to a notable milestone that XRP achieved following its bullish breakout last week. In a Monday tweet , he noted that the XRPL native token attained its highest weekly close in three years. Cryptoes on X Barely a week ago, XRP traded around 50 cents, recording minute gains despite a broader market bullish momentum. However, positive sentiments around the ecosystem grew following strong macroeconomic factors, propelling the price outbreak.As XRP gained momentum, its price broke past multi-year resistances to trade above $1 after over three years of trying to attain the price mark. XRP grew to a weekly high of $1.26 on November 16 before closing at $1.0545.Meanwhile, XRP's performance last week increased its monthly and yearly gains to 116% and 97%, respectively. The asset also became the top gainer in the past seven days among the top 20 crypto assets by market cap.What Next for XRP?As bullish momentum persists in the XRP ecosystem, discussion on a possible price target for the coin has gained momentum. Analyst Cryptoes also sparked the conversation in his Monday tweet, identifying XRP's highest weekly close since 2021.Notably, lofty price targets are making the rounds as analysts expect XRP to sustain this renewed bullish traction. For instance, analyst Egrag placed an audacious $17 target for the XRPL native token, citing the ""Bent Fork"" theory.Another analyst, Steph, noted that XRP would target $14. The commentator based his assertions on the tightening of the Bollinger band and XRP's correlation with global liquidity.Meanwhile, other targets like $5, $8, and $11 still exist as analysts tap the brightening regulatory cloud in the US and a possible conclusion of Ripple's case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to propel XRP to unprecedented highs.At the time of writing, XRP trades at $1.170, up 14% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/11/18/xrp-records-highest-weekly-close-in-3-years-after-surging-past-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xrp-records-highest-weekly-close-in-3-years-after-surging-past-1,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

MSTR's options market exhibited extreme upside fear or bullish speculative frenzy.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} and everything else tied to cryptocurrency have been on fire since Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5. Those looking to board the crypto freight train now should be ready for potential twists and turns in the wild rise as data tracked by JPMorgan and other analysts shows things are getting frenzied out there.  As BTC rose past the $93,000 mark last week and inflows into the U.S.-listed spot ETFs and crypto stocks surged, JPMorgan's retail sentiment score rose to a record high of 4. The measure is designed to gauge the sentiment of retail investors toward cryptocurrencies, especially bitcoin, based on the activity in the family of BTC products, including spot ETFs.  ""Within ETF space, demand for Bitcoin ETFs was particularly strong (IBIT +3.4z) following the election results. The demand for Bitcoin was also reflected in COIN (+6z). In fact, their sentiment score for the Bitcoin family (for both physical ETFs and others) soared to a multi-sigma high,"" JPMorgan's equity research team said in a note to clients last week, discussing the retail order imbalance.  The z score of 3.4 and higher indicates a substantial and positive deviation from the average, indicating strong demand.  Meanwhile, the options market tied to shares in bitcoin-holder MicroStrategy (MSTR) exhibited a record bullish sentiment, also pointing to frenzied trading often observed at market peaks.  The one-year 25-delta put-call skew nosedived to -26.7% on Wednesday. It meant that call options used to hedge against or profit from price rallies traded at a significantly higher premium to puts offering downside, according to chart from Market Chameleon shared by pseudonymous analyst Markets&Mayhem on X.  The skew recovered somewhat to -11.8% on Friday, still exhibiting a solid bias for upside bets. BTC calls have been consistently pricier than puts, but the differential has been notably narrower than MSTR.  ""Call skew in MSTR is so wildly euphoric that it is hard to imagine we don't see a more meaningful drawdown unless bitcoin continues to move in a parabolic fashion higher. For now, it appears to be cooling off just a little bit from its highs,"" Markets&Mayhem said.

42415513,V83uyxCwmh6ufrmZyOJiWQ,1731906716,"CAT Token Expands to Solana, Setting Up Long-Term Bullish Move","CAT, the memecoin linked to Simon's Cat, is expanding to the Solana blockchain to tap into its active trading community.  A vault provides early access to BONK token holders who have locked their tokens for 12 months.  Solana's ecosystem has become a focal point for memecoin activities, with significant trading volumes and fees.  CAT, the licensed memecoin of the internet cartoon character Simon's Cat, is expanding to the Solana blockchain to capture newer trading audiences.  Long-term holders of Solana stalwart BONK, a dog-themed memecoin created in late 2022, who locked their tokens for 12 months would get early access to CAT on Solana. A vault will offer up to $100,000 worth of CAT at a discounted rate compared to the market price at launch.  The vault has been filled in excess of an initial $100,000 target as of Asian morning hours, with $240,000 worth of stablecoins deposited for CAT on Solana, data shows.  Solana has emerged as a memecoin hotbed in the past years, often seeing frenzied periods of token issuances and trading, that create a loop of demand for SOL — with those gains often trickling back into newer tokens.  Other networks have yet to see similar activity take off. Earlier this year, in March, for example, Solana amassed $3.2 million in fees over 24 hours, beating a $300,000 record from 2021. Onchain volumes climbed over $3 billion, flipping a November 2022 record of $300 million, as a CoinDesk analysis showed. No other popular blockchain, such as Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Tron, saw a bump in activity during that period, indicating that traders’ attention was focused on a single network.  That reason primarily drives CAT’s decision to expand to Solana.  “BNB has given $CAT a strong, reliable foundation with solid liquidity, but we’re excited to open the doors to Solana’s high-speed, low-cost network, which is hugely popular among retail traders and the memecoin crowd,” a Simon’s Cat core team member told CoinDesk under anonymity.  “Solana’s deep support from exchanges means even more opportunities for trading and liquidity, which is a major boost. And we’re just getting started—there’s plenty more on our roadmap,” the team added in a Telegram message.  The Simon’s Cat token was created in early August with Floki, BNB Chain, and DWF Labs. CAT is officially linked to the mainstream Simon's Cat brand and is the first major cat memecoin on the BNB Chain, backed by the company's IP, which earned $5.8 billion in revenue last year.  CAT is up 11% in the past 24 hours and has nearly doubled in the past two weeks alongside a broader memecoin rally, data shows.",POSITIVE,SOL | BONK,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BONK,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/11/18/cat-token-expands-to-solana-setting-up-long-term-bullish-move,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a298c5710249a8d17e395e11325aa0e514c7e3cd-1024x576.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
