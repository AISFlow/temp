42397132,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYt9H,1367266525,Are alternative Ecoins 'anti-bitcoins'?,"Take it as a sign of bitcoin's growing mainstream visibility: other alternative currencies are being branded with the label the ""anti-bitcoin.""  Writing in FT Alphaville, Joseph Cotterill last week featured a link to a post by Barnard College economics professor Rajiv Sethi about a local currency project in the US called Macon Money. Along with the link, Cotterill added in parentheses, ""(the anti-Bitcoin?)""  Sethi later noted Cotterill's comment, adding, ""Exactly right, and very well put.""  So what's Macon Money? Funded with $65,000 from the Knight Foundation, the project backed the issue of ""Macon Money"" bonds throughout the Macon, Georgia, community. People who got a hold of half a bond (bonds were cut in two to provide a social incentive for holders to engage with others in town) and found someone with the other half could redeem the bond for Macon Money that could be spent at local businesses. Participating businesses could exchange the local money dollar-for-dollar with US greenbacks.  Readers at the economics blog naked capitalism, which reposted Sethi's article, didn't necessarily agree with the ""anti-bitcoin"" label, though many cheered the Macon experiment.  ""I'm not sure if it's the 'anti-Bitcoin' exactly,"" responded reader YankeeFrank. ""In some ways perhaps: bitcoin is globally, rather than locally, traded and spent, and is not tradeable at par with a fiat currency. But bitcoin has allowed markets in products arbitrarily deemed illegal to flourish, and it is exchangeable for fiat currencies, albeit at wildly fluctuating rates. There is also a large bitcoin ecosystem of companies springing up to perform just the sort of currency trading described in the variation of the 'Macon-Money' scheme proposed herein.""  Commenter Mitch Shapiro added, ""A key here is how the (alternative) currencies are designed and managed and what their purpose is. Bitcoin is one version, which I’d consider a libertarian techie attempt to recreate the gold standard ... a bad idea from the start.""  Still, Shapiro noted, ""if there are other steps that can be taken to build a bottoms-up system of exchanging real value than I’m all for it.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,Dan Ilett,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/29/are-alternative-ecoins-anti-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397143,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtI8,1367265409,"Canadian banks tell BTC exchanges, 'Take off'","A number of Canadian bitcoin exchanges are running into regulatory challenges, as the country’s big banks move to close their accounts, in many cases without explanation.  Earlier this month, the Royal Bank of Canada closed the accounts of Calgary-based VirtEx as well as Canadian Bitcoins, an Ottawa-based bitcoin exchange. Canadian Bitcoins has also had its TD Bank account cancelled.  ""They shut down our account without any reason,"" said VirtEx owner Joseph David told the Financial Post. ""They just said we have the right to refuse service to whomever we wish.""  James Grant, the owner of Canadian Bitcoins, told The Canadian Press he was given no explanation for the closure, which he says has ""crippled"" his business.  Grant said he is attempting to bolster his exchange's legitimacy by requiring identification from customers and reporting large transactions.  ""Anti-money laundering policy is a big thing, and that's what banks are concerned about,"" he said. ""We have invoices, and receipts, and customer documentation for every customer that we deal with.""  Melvin Ng, an engineering student at the University of Waterloo and the founder of a new bitcoin exchange called CAD/Bitcoin, told the Financial Post, ""Only in Canada do you get a situation where a bank can shut down your account and you're out of business.""  In a press release on SBWire, Ng stated, ""Banks should certainly feel threatened by this new virtual currency, as bitcoins will soon replace the need for banks to transfer money across borders. Bitcoin will revolutionize the banking industry, just like Bittorrent changed the video and music industry.""  Although bitcoin is designed to work outside the traditional banking system, in reality bitcoin owners are constantly trading their virtual currencies for dollars.  The banks have declined to comment on the account closures, citing privacy reasons.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | SPONSORED,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/29/canadian-banks-tell-btc-exchanges-take-off,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397141,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtH9,1367258966,'Rise and Rise of Bitcoin' film tries crowdfunding,"A group of US filmmakers is using bitcoin to crowdfund its documentary on the rise of the virtual currency.  ""The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,"" about a computer programmer obsessed with the virtual currency, explores the competitive mining market and the startups involved in the bitcoin community.  The movie is being produced by 44th Floor Productions, DARONIMAX Media and Fair Acres Media. The director is Nicolas Mross, who previously directed horror movie Riddle.  Putting their money where their mouth is, the filmmakers hope to help fund the production with bitcoins. A donation page on their website welcomes bitcoin payments, in addition to PayPal and credit card options.  ""We clearly love bitcoins, but we're happy to accept fiat as well,"" the page notes.  The filmmakers are seeking donations via the movie's website in part because the crowdfunding community hasn't yet embraced bitcoin payments. Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, doesn’t accept the currency ... although bitcoin supporters have tried. Kickstarter has accepted some bitcoin-related projects, however.  On the other hand, Bitcoinstarter -- a crowdfunding project specifically designed to take payments in bitcoins -- is up and running. However, it appears to have some way to go before it reaches Kickstarter-like levels of funding success.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/29/rise-and-rise-of-bitcoin-film-tries-crowdfunding,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397135,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtCE,1367255983,HTML standards embrace bitcoin,"Bitcoin took an important step closer to broader consumer adoption last week, when it became supported by the HTML 5 standard.  This means one-click support for bitcoin payments could make its way into popular browsers before long.  HTML is the language used to describe what a webpage looks like to a web browser. Version 5, which has been in development for years, is not yet ratified. Nevertheless, browsers already use many features of this standard while it is in ongoing development.  Last week, the ""bitcoin"" handler was introduced (technically, ""whitelisted"") into HTML 5. As browser developers roll out support in their software, it means that a hyperlink can be encoded to start a bitcoin payment.  Currently, when bitcoin users wish to make a payment, they must manually send bitcoins to an address from within their web wallet or application wallet. Generally, this involves either scanning a QR code, or copying and pasting a bitcoin address.  Under the new system, a hyperlink to a bitcoin address could be encoded with the ""bitcoin:"" label in a webpage or any other document using HTML, such as an email message.  Clicking on the link would activate the bitcoin wallet designated by the user, which would then be set up to make the payment. This is similar to the ""mailto:"" link in current versions of HTML, which activates the appropriate email client to send a mail.  This isn't yet a full web standards embrace of bitcoin, though, because there are currently two different versions of the HTML 5 specification. The ""bitcoin:"" label has been ratified by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which is a split from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) group. However, browser developers pay close attention to the WHATWG. The developers of Chromium, for example, which is the open-source code on which Google is Chrome is based, have said that they build WHATWG features into their browser.  Ecoin fans have expressed ambivalence about the move in discussion forums. Several users on Y Combinator's Hacker News page, for example, lamented the fac there was a label for bitcoin but not for any other cryptocurrency.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/29/html-standards-embrace-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397137,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAaYtEC,1367253846,Q&A: Bitcoin Foundation eyes legal minefields,"In the wake of reports linking the closure of several bitcoin exchanges with recently released guidance by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), CoinDesk spoke with Bitcoin Foundation general counsel Patrick Murck about the impact of the FinCEN regulations. (Murck is also a principal and founder of Engage Legalhttp://www.engagelegal.com/, with expertise in legal and regulatory issues governing the use of bitcoin and virtual economies.)  CD: Are you surprised that the regulations are (directly or indirectly) leading to exchange closures?  Murch: ""No, I'm not surprised. Since long before the guidelines came out I have been counseling bitcoin exchange operators, both formally and informally, to register with FinCEN as Money Service Businesses (MSBs) and to run a thorough AML/KYC (anti-money laundering/know-your-customer) compliance program for all users of their service. FinCEN stepping in is the least surprising aspect of the guidelines being released.  ""Anyone who wants to operate a bitcoin exchange should be consulting with a payments attorney who is familiar with the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) as well as state MTB (money transfer business) licensing requirements. This is a highly regulated space and it requires both capital and expertise to navigate it, for better or worse.""  CD: Should the bitcoin community be making more of a fuss about these regulations?  Patrick: ""Perhaps, but that is for each member of the community to decide for themselves. The impact is most clearly being felt by (in order): 1) exchange operators, 2) miners and mining pool operators, and 3) traders and speculators. Most other members of the community, those transacting bitcoin for goods and services, have been left alone for now.  ""Like much of the bitcoin ecosystem, the infrastructure for creating an effective dialogue with the government is being built but still a work in progress. The Bitcoin Foundation is one piece of that infrastructure, and we have been active in educating financial institutions, banks and the government about bitcoin. Anyone in the community can become a member of the Foundation and influence this dialogue and anyone can help by donating to the Foundation so we have greater resources to engage in the debate and defend bitcoin as necessary.""  CD: In your recent blog post on this subject, you say more guidance from FinCEN is required. What kind of guidance are you looking for?  Patrick: ""The original guidance issued by FinCEN was, with all due respect, poorly drafted. This is an opinion shared by several high-profile payments attorneys with whom I've discussed this issue. Every bitcoin business I've spoken with desperately wants to understand and follow the rules; they are relying on institutions like FinCEN to give them clear and actionable guidance so they can have assurance that they won't wind up in jail or fined into oblivion. It is the duty of our federal and state agencies to provide well thought-out and intelligible rules of the road and to work with businesses and the public to understand the issues; unfortunately, that didn't happen here. I'm hopeful that this can be thought of as an opportunity to engage FinCEN and other regulators in that conversation.""  CD: And any thoughts on Bradley Jensen's contention that the FinCEN regulations are a prelude to prosecution?  Patrick: ""Predicting prosecution that may be tied back to bitcoin from the DOJ (Department of Justice) and federal or state regulators is like predicting the sun will rise in the east -- eventually you will be right. There have been rumors swirling around DC for over two years that prosecutions and/or a bitcoin crackdown was looming. More worrisome to me is the activity bubbling up from the states around unlicensed money transmission using virtual currency generally and bitcoin as well. At the state level it's clear that inquiries are under way and '10-day' letters (demanding action or compliance) have been issued.  ""It may be that the guidelines were a prelude to federal prosecutions or enforcement activity or it may be for other reasons entirely. Perhaps the rank and file at FinCEN saw the volume of bitcoin-related MSB registrations coming in under the 'seller of prepaid access' category or maybe they had received a number of requests for clarification from other agencies or financial institutions. We know that FinCEN drafted an inter-agency bulletin about bitcoin, and the Foundation has issued a FOIA request for to obtain it.  ""The biggest threat to FinCEN realizing its own goals and mandate (to prevent financial crime) is that they lean too hard on the existing, centralized system of exchanges and push market share to further decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges. FinCEN has talked a big game about public-private partnerships but hasn't followed through. I would be more than happy to have a public discussion with FinCEN and any other state or federal agency about bitcoin, consumer protection and financial crime regulations. The genie is out of the bottle and distributed, math-based currency is here to stay.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/04/29/qa-bitcoin-foundation-eyes-legal-minefields,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
