Ether Plummets Post-Merge; Bitcoin Sees Red as Well  By James Rubin  After holding steady in the hours immediately following the Ethereum Merge on Thursday, ether and other major cryptos tumbled.  Ether was recently trading below $1,500, a roughly 10% dive over the past 24 hours, and its largest, daily drop since late August. The second-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization had topped $2,000 earlier that month largely on Merge euphoria. The technological overhaul that has changed the Ethereum blockchain to a more energy efficient proof-of-work (PoW) protocol went seamlessly, and data from crypto futures markets on Thursday showed that many investors seemed to have closed out hedged positions in the ensuing hours.  The trend signaled that they were wrapping up trades they had made during the previous month or past few weeks to bet on possible outcomes of the event, including the possibility of a revolt by crypto miners wanting to continue operating in the PoW system.  ""We’ve seen that there was bullish positioning into the Merge, and as an industry we’re already looking for what’s next,"" Jon Campagna, partner and head of trading and capital markets at crypto investment firm CoinFund, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Campagna noted ether and other cryptos' recent tendency to track stocks, and riskier assets ongoing vulnerability to wider uncertainties. ""We’re at the throes of challenging macroeconomic factors, which seem to persist,"" he wrote. ""It’s unclear if we will see enough idiosyncratic performance in the asset class to materially deviate from equities at this time.""  Bitcoin  Bitcoin fell below the psychologically important $20,000 barrier for the first time since Sept. 8, a nearly 3% drop from the previous day. The largest crypto in market value has tended to underperform ether in recent weeks. Other cryptocurrencies from the CoinDesk top 20 by market cap stood firmly in a red swamp with popular meme coins DOGE and SHIB and ADA recently off more than 3%.  Stocks  Equity markets also had their problems with the tech-focused Nasdaq and the S&P 500, which has a strong technology component, both declining more than a percentage point, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) losing about 0.5%. Investors remain skittish about inflation and the looming robustness of the U.S. central bank's next interest rate hike at its Federal Open Reserve Committee meeting in less than a week. Observers of monetary policy widely expect a third, consecutive 75 basis point increase, although the odds of a 100 basis point rise ticked higher on Wednesday.  Among the latest data in a week of key economic reports, retail sales kicked higher by 0.3%, reflecting consumers continued buying strength and an about-face from July when sales declined 0.4%. But rates for 30-year fixed, residential mortgages hit 6% on Thursday for the first time in nearly 15 years, another blow to a weakening housing market.  Merge issues dominated crypto news. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin said the event had lowered the world’s energy consumption by 0.2%, marking what may be one of the single biggest decarbonization efforts in history. And U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said that staked cryptocurrencies may be subject to federal securities regulations, repeating a pro-oversight stance in the wake of Ethereum’s transition to just such a method.  CoinFund's Campagna suggested that ether's price drop could be temporary, highlighting its fluctuations after the Ethereum network's last major upgrade in August 2021. ""It spent the following days slowly trading down 5% to $3,060, before rallying 30% in two weeks, closing at $3,940 on Sept. 3,"" he said. ""Granted, the macro environment has shifted during that time.  ""Could we see the pattern repeat?""

Their struggles are not entirely because of crypto, yet Ethereum’s shift to proof-of-stake might provide an interesting opportunity for investors.  Despite an exciting few moments where record-setting exchange inflows of ether signaled a potential sell-off, ether traded flat in the hours following the Merge and then dropped more than 9% at one point during the following U.S. trading day. Ethereum classic (ETC) was recently up 1% as proof-of-work fans stage a protest vote with their trading accounts.  As a result of this, graphics processing unit (GPU) prices are in free fall, and data from analyst house John Peddie Research shows that channel supply (distributors) is bulging.  Nvidia, never a fan of crypto mining, will always downplay things. Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress’ line is that the company has “limited visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand” and is “unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced cryptocurrency mining contributed to the decline in Gaming demand.” Perhaps these non-answers have resulted from Nvidia’s settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to disclose that crypto mining was a major contributor to its 2018 revenue.  Nvidia and crypto mining  It would be reasonable to assume that Nvidia’s stock is being driven down because of the glut of GPUs on the market. But that’s not entirely the case.  Nvidia does not only sell GPUs on the retail level but also to organizations using data centers and high-performance computers that crunch large stacks of numbers for research purposes. The ability of these chips to address massive amounts of information and make CPUs more efficient through what’s called parallel computing, makes them a considerable asset worldwide. Thus, data center is the company’s largest segment.  China has been a large buyer of these data center chips during the last decade, as the country’s industries double down on artificial intelligence and its universities catch up to their American counterparts in research. Within these companies and universities data centers are Nvidia’s chips.  This demand is why Nvidia’s stock tumbled when Washington announced an export ban on its most advanced AI chips to China, alongside AMD which also designs similar products. Nvidia said the new ban could mean the loss of up to $400 million in revenue; AMD didn’t disclose its loss but it's expected to also be large.  This scenario has precedent. In 2015, the U.S. Department of Commerce banned the export of Intel’s Xeon chips, used in data centers, to some of China’s largest universities, including China's National University of Defense Technology, which was at the time developing the world’s fastest supercomputer. The rationale given was that these universities were engaged in nuclear weapons research.  Intel’s stock was unaffected by the news.  In contrast, Nvidia’s dropped nearly 10% on the news of its export ban, compounding losses throughout the year as tech stocks have struggled. Nvidia has lost nearly half its value, putting it back to where it was in October 2020.  An overreaction?  Could this all be an overreaction, and the market acting irrationally? Maybe, says one analyst.  “We view the 8% sell-off in the stock yesterday (vs 2% SOX) as an overreaction, and view the recent weakness as a particular buying opportunity,” Jeffries analyst Mark Lipacis was quoted as saying.  Lipacis notes that most of Nvidia’s business in China goes to tech giants not the government which would make it easier for the company to get an export license, insulating its loss potential.  Analysts polled by Dow Jones seem to agree that there’s a value buy here; 27 give it a buy rating, 11 say it’s best to hold, and one says it’s a sell.  The decline of mining has likely already been priced into the stock too. As early as February, when the company closed its fiscal fourth quarter, the mining market was beginning to bottom out.  Of course, there are bother proof-of-work systems such as Ethereum Classic. But Ethereum Classic’s post-Merge jump in hashrate is frivolous: It's only at 142 TH/s, which is a fraction of the roughly 950-1000 TH/s with which Ethereum finished its last quarter.  Nvidia is going to fight against a nearly 13% decline of PC sales year-over-year and glut in the channel. Meanwhile, the gaming market is expected to cross $200 billion this year – which gives Nvidia plenty of room to move past Ethereum.

As pointed out previously, the Ethereum Merge had looked to be a &apos;buy the rumor, sell the news&apos; event, which seems to be playing out, but the lack of highly fluctuating prices suggests that even the expected sell-offs seemed not to have happened. Instead, it looks to be that momentum is currently muted, making it impossible for the price to swing either way. Merge Is Priced In During the rallies that led up to the Ethereum Merge, there were debates on whether the upgrade had been finally priced into the value of the digital asset. At one point, ETH had rode the wave up to $2,000 but quickly lost its footing. Given this, it was a matter of what would be best for the digital asset.

42373816,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWvVKCt,1663280102,Investors Add $74M to Crypto-Focused Valkyrie Trusts,"Valkyrie, an alternative investment firm that had $1.2 billion in assets under management at the end of the second quarter, has added $73.6 million in fresh capital to two of its crypto-focused trusts, according to amended filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The older of the two funds was launched last year, but the recent growth indicates that investors have continued to flow into the crypto industry despite the bear market.  The Valkyrie Tron Trust, which gives accredited investors access to the TRX (TRX) cryptocurrency, has now raised just shy of $50 million, up from a paltry $57 in sales in July 2021.  The Valkyrie Avalanche Trust, offering exposure to the AVAX (AVAX) token, first appeared in an SEC filing in January, but the first sale had yet to occur. The trust has now raised nearly $24 million, falling a bit short of the $25 million that Valkyrie said in May that it had lined up for the then-newly announced trust.  “Tron has gained significant traction because the Tron network continues to see continued transaction growth, including for stablecoins, and investors familiar with the Asia-Pacific region have started taking notice,” a Valkyrie spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. “Avalanche is also seeing increased adoption at a substantial rate, including earlier this week when KKR announced a deal with Securitize to tokenize a piece of a private equity fund on the Avalanche blockchain.”  Nashville, Tenn.-based Valkyrie offers six protocol-focused trusts, a decentralized finance (DeFi) hedge fund, three Nasdaq-listed exchange-traded funds (ETF) and a protocol treasury management business. In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved Valkyrie’s XBTO Bitcoin Futures Fund. Two months later, the firm announced its move into venture capital with a planned $30 million fund focused on early-stage startups in Israel.  Valkyrie closed an $11 million strategic funding round in July backed by traditional finance heavyweights BNY Mellon and Wedbush. The firm said the funding was driven more by the strategic partnerships than the capital.

42421441,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMSz,1663277414,OFAC Backtracks but Tornado Cash Sanctions Already Set a Terrifying Precedent,"On Sept. 13, the U.S. Treasury Department provided some clarity on the Tornado Cash sanctions. The federal agency updated its FAQs to say that “interacting with open-source code itself” is not illegal. However this came with a caveat – this interaction is only legal as long as it does not include a prohibited transaction.  It further explained that copying the protocol’s code, publishing the code and even visiting an archived version of the Tornado Cash website are all allowed.  Zac Colbert is a financial writer.  “Similarly, U.S. persons would not be prohibited by U.S. sanctions regulations from visiting the Internet archives for the Tornado Cash historical website, nor would they be prohibited from visiting the Tornado Cash website if it again becomes active on the Internet,” according to the U.S. agency.  A glimmer of hope there, perhaps, for what was one of the leading Ethereum-based mixers. But is it mere coincidence that this move comes just days after the Coinbase crypto exchange filed a lawsuit in response to the sanctions?  Treasury violates the First Amendment  Coinbase’s lawsuit claims the sanctions themselves are a violation of the First Amendment, which establishes the right of free speech. In the landmark case of 1996, Bernstein v. the Department of Justice (DOJ), it was established that computer code should be considered speech, and the right to free speech is protected by the U.S. Constitution.  And so, by sanctioning this open-source code the Treasury Department is effectively limiting speech.  Back in August, when the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned the Ethereum-based smart contract, it was the first time the government department blacklisted a piece of technology not explicitly tied to a person or entity. Its specially designated nationals list is typically limited to individuals and institutions.  “We have no issue with the Treasury sanctioning bad actors and we take a hard stance against unlawful behavior. But in this case Treasury went much further and took the unprecedented step of sanctioning an entire technology instead of specific individuals,” Coinbase said in a blog post.  Dapp developers, beware  Just because a tool is sanctioned doesn’t guarantee hackers, criminals and the like will refrain from utilizing it. Criminals by definition have no respect for the law, so it’s reasonable to assume they will continue using the smart contract for their nefarious purposes, sanctions be damned.  Whereas North Korean-linked Lazarus Group got away with an alleged $455 million by laundering stolen money through the smart contract mixer – one of the primary catalysts for the sanctions – Alexey Pertsev, a Tornado Cash developer, got arrested. On Aug. 23 it was revealed he’d be spending an additional 90 days in jail, at minimum.  Pertsev has never been formally charged with a crime by the Dutch investigators, who said other arrests related to Tornado Cash may be coming down the pike. Whether OFAC’s clarifications will play into his release remains to be seen – but it seems to support the argument that publishing open-source code is not a crime.  A developer has little to no say how their software is used, and even less over who uses it. How much tech talent will now be put off from creating the next big blockchain innovation?  Shortsighted strategies and a threat to privacy  Pertsev’s arrest rightfully instigated considerable ire from the Web3 community, which has warned of the alarming effect it has had on developers already. The fact he was arrested in the first place and held without bail was taken as a chilling precedent.  It can also be argued that the sanction itself is overbroad, keeping people who have legitimate reasons to use mixers and liquidity pools from doing so and putting their financial privacy and personal data security at risk.  Open-source software is accessible to anyone. The Ethereum blockchain exists to be accessible to anyone. While the code is still accessible, the U.S. government has done the tens of thousands of U.S. crypto users a disservice by erecting needless bans. Tornado Cash is far closer to a public good than a piece of contraband.  This is without saying whether or not it’s practical to sanction a piece of code. If it’s open source, it’s free to fork. If that happens OFAC will continually be playing catch-up, trying to sanction newly deployed smart contracts left, right and center. It’s not a realistic strategy, let alone completely unwarranted.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY, Zac Colbert,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/15/ofac-backtracks-but-tornado-cash-sanctions-already-set-a-terrifying-precedent,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cfbc2115dfa0399a62d3bc66f93610eb87b6498-1800x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

An auction was held this week through bankruptcy court for Voyager’s assets. At the final stage it was a battle between billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange and Wave Financial, a digital-asset investment firm, according to the person.  FTX’s bid was higher, the person added. It’s unclear how much FTX agreed to pay.  FTX didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. A Wave representative declined to comment.  Read more: Behind Voyager’s Fall: Crypto Broker Acted Like a Bank, Went Bankrupt  CoinDesk reported on Aug. 25 that FTX and Binance were in the hunt to acquire Voyager. FTX had made an offer for Voyager that was rejected in July as a “low-ball bid.” The presence of Wave among bidders hadn’t previously been revealed. Earlier this week, CoinDesk reported that FTX is raising capital in parallel with a potential acquisition.  A deal for Voyager could bring a relatively tidy end to one of the most harrowing tales from a terrible year for crypto.  After crypto prices sank, Voyager in early July barred customers from withdrawing their money. Its clients then became company creditors in bankruptcy court, forced to get in line with sophisticated restructuring lawyers and financiers as novice participants in a potentially laborious process to get their funds back. Unlike a conventional bank, Voyager’s failure didn’t trigger government-backed deposit insurance that makes most bank customers whole – which apparently surprised some Voyager users.

42422329,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jybh,1663275604,Market Wrap: Markets Trade Lower Despite Success of Ethereum Merge,"Price Action  The Ethereum Merge, one of the most widely anticipated and monitored events in the history of digital assets, went smoothly early Thursday morning, as scheduled.  At approximately 06:43 UTC, Ethereum successfully transitioned from a proof-of-work consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake, intended to reduce both energy consumption and the supply of the native ether token.  Despite the upgrade’s success, both BTC and ETH declined in price on Thursday, as did the prices across traditional financial markets.  Ether (ETH) fell 9% on above-average volume. The price declined mildly following the Merge and continued down for the remainder of the day. A more pronounced 6% decline occurred during around 14:00 UTC as volume spiked, but the dip does not appear to be Merge related. Implied volatility (IV) for ether declined sharply following the Merge’s success as fears of potential problems were alleviated.  Bitcoin (BTC) declined 2% on moderate volume. On an hourly basis, BTC saw a similar aggressive drop in prices around 14:00 UTC. A look across traditional financial markets shows corresponding declines.  Economic Calendar: Initial jobless claims for the week ending Sept. 10 were 213,000, down from 218,000 the prior week, a figure that was revised downward from 222,000. The jobless claims data surpassed the analyst consensus of 225,000.  Continuing jobless claims were 1.403 million, up slightly from a revised total of 1.401 million in the prior week.  U.S. Equities: Traditional equities traded down, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), tech-heavy Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 off 0.6%, 1.4% and 1.1%, respectively.  Commodities: Energy markets traded down, with crude oil and natural gas falling 3.8% and 9.2%, respectively. Safe-haven asset gold fell 2%, while copper prices declined 1.3%  The Dollar Index (DXY) declined 0.01% on Thursday  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index to measure the performance across a basket of currencies, declined 4%.  Latest Prices  ● Bitcoin (BTC): $19,823 −0.4%        ● Ether (ETH): $1,505 −5.6%        ● CoinDesk Market Index (CMI): $990 −1.9%        ● S&P 500 daily close: 3,901.35 −1.1%        ● Gold: $1,674 per troy ounce −1.3%        ● Ten-year Treasury yield daily close: 3.46% +0.05         Bitcoin, ether and gold prices are taken at approximately 4pm New York time.

Information about CoinDesk Indices can be found at coindesk.com/indices.  Technical Take  ETH prices decline, despite successful Merge  Ether fell sharply on Thursday despite one of the most important events in cryptocurrency history occurring without a hitch.  The close to 9% price decline does not appear to be related to the Merge’s impact (i.e., the increase in energy efficiency, reduction in ether supply, etc). Instead, there’s likely a “sell the fact” price move in play as an “Ethereum Merge” trade unwinds.  Investors likely believe the Merge will affect the long-term supply of ether and efficiency of the blockchain itself, and see the Merge less as a short-term catalyst for price movement.  Overall, Thursday’s 9% fall marks the fourth decline over 8% for ether over the most recent 30 days, with the largest decline occurring on Aug. 19 (12.89%). On each of the prior occasions, trading volume exceeded its 20-day moving average, as it has today as well.  On a technical basis, ETH’s hourly chart shows that prices began to rebound after 14:00 UTC but reversed after falling below $1,500.  On-chain data shows that funding rates for ETH are still negative. Funding rates represent payments between buyers and sellers of futures contracts.  When rates are negative, sellers are likely driving the market, as they pay buyers (longs) a premium while remaining short. Funding rates can often be used to measure market sentiment.  As stated in the Sept. 12 Market Wrap, funding rates over the last 30 days continue to be negative, spiking directly ahead of the Merge. Expectations are that funding rates will begin to moderate in the near future because any fears surrounding an unsuccessful Merge turned out to be unfounded.  The long-term premise that the conversion to a proof-of-stake protocol will be a deflationary event has proven to be true for the time being.  Four minutes following the Merge (06:47 UTC), ether’s supply declined by approximately 30 ETH. As of 18:20 UTC, ETH’s supply declined by approximately 254 ETH. As traders go long on ether in anticipation of buying a deflationary asset, their narrative is currently being confirmed.

42422326,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jyPh,1663274131,Ethereum Already Showing Signs of Increased Centralization,"In the hours following Ethereum's long-awaited Merge on Thursday, over 40% of the network’s blocks were added by just two entities: Coinbase and Lido.  The shift from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) was framed by developers as a way to defeat centralization on the second-largest blockchain network by making it harder for individual entities to tamper with the Ethereum ledger. But early signs of network consolidation have raised concerns that those hopes may not come to pass.  “Out of the last 1,000 blocks, 420 have been built by just Lido and Coinbase,” Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, an Ethereum infrastructure firm, wrote in a tweet.  In his thread, Köppelmann mentioned that just seven players own more than two-thirds of the stake on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network – the key measure of network power under the new miner-free system. Lido, a kind of community-led staking collective, and Coinbase, the world's third-largest crypto exchange, own 27.5% and 14.5% of the network’s stake, respectively.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Ethereum's long-awaited Merge to PoS was successfully completed at 6:42 UTC on Thursday morning. The new system invites so-called validators to stake 32 ETH with the platform, granting them ability to write and confirm transactions to the Ethereum ledger. That high capital requirement ($50,000 at press time), along with the technical difficulty of setting up a validator system, means that only a few people are able to become validators on their own.  As a result, ETH has flowed to services offered by Coinbase, Lido, and other staking pools that allow users to become validators – and earn rewards for doing so – without much of a hassle.  So much money going to so few services has sparked concerns: If a single entity controls more than 66% of the network’s staked ether, it will be able to make it more difficult for others to write transactions to Ethereum’s ledger.  Fears of validator centralization became more prescient last month, after U.S. government sanctions raised questions around whether validators might be forced to censor transactions coming from certain blockchain addresses. Some, though not all, U.S.-based validators have announced that they will begin to ignore transactions from the sanctioned Tornado Crash mixer program, meaning it might be more difficult for those transactions to make it onto Ethereum’s decentralized ledger.

42422318,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jyFh,1663273371,Ethereum Miners Are Quickly Dying Less Than 24 Hours After the Merge,"Ethereum miners are finding it increasingly hard to make money after the Merge as too many of them are switching to alternative coins, crushing mining profitability.  Earlier Thursday, Ethereum, which is the world’s second-largest blockchain network, switched its consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake from proof-of-work in order to boost efficiency and lower energy consumption. However, the software update – dubbed the Merge – also meant that miners were no longer needed to secure the network, and so rig operators moved their machines to other PoW blockchains.  “Graphics processing units (GPU) mining is dead less than 24 hours after the Merge,” tweeted Ben Gagnon, chief mining officer at bitcoin miner Bitfarms (BITF). The three largest GPU chains have very low profits, and “the only coins showing profit have no market cap or liquidity,” he added.  The hashrate, or computing power, used to mine PoW altcoins like ethereum classic (ETC) and ravencoin (RVN) doubled in the hours after the Merge took place. Alongside a rising hashrate, however, is rising difficulty, meaning miners are less likely to successfully mine a block and reap the block reward.  The reward for mining an Ethereum Classic block about 24 hours ago was ETC 0.0186484, or about 70 cents, but a check in the past hour found that’s tumbled to just ETC 0.00030658, or about 11 cents, according to data from Minerstat. Similarly, RVN miners could earn RVN 30.28478584, or $1.77 per block 24 hours ago, and in the past hour, that’s dropped to just RVN 0.82968431, or about 5 cents.  “As suspected, too many ETH miners switched over to ETC,” Ethan Vera, chief operations officer of mining services firm Luxor Technologies, tweeted on Thursday.  “Even running new generation hardware at sub 3 cent power is not profitable on ETC now … That electricity price is much lower than what households in the U.S. pay, and even to what industrial consumers like bitcoin miners pay in several parts of the country.”  Vera estimated that 20%-30% of ethereum miners have migrated to other networks, with the rest of them simply shutting down.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Gensler said that proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains, which generate new coins for inventors who pool their holdings, take on investment contract-like attributes that could bring them under his agency’s purview. He said he wasn’t talking about a specific coin, according to the Journal.  Still, the comments, which came hours after Ethereum completed its PoS transition via the Merge, indicate that the milestone tech upgrade may carry greater ramifications for the second-most popular blockchain than simply cutting its energy usage. As a proof-of-work chain, its native ether token was one of only two cryptos – the other being bitcoin – clearly defined as commodities by federal regulators.

42411080,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1giBzlz,1663270707,"1 Year of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The Bad, the Good and the Ugly","Today, Sept. 15, marks El Salvador’s Independence Day. On this date in 1821, the Provincial Council of Guatemala proclaimed the independence of the entire region from the Spanish Empire in a document known as the Act of Independence of Central America. It’s a date worth celebrating – even compared to other empires, the Spanish were particularly cruel.  But the American Empire in the 20th century can’t be far behind in that ranking, especially when it comes to its actions in Central America. And this month marks the one-year anniversary of a much more recent independence struggle: El Salvador’s effort to decouple its economy from the U.S. dollar by recognizing bitcoin (BTC) as legal tender and encouraging nationwide adoption of the cryptocurrency.  That’s the only reason the Salvadoran Bitcoin Law made some sense: In part thanks to the very instability bred by American interventions in the 1980s, El Salvador abandoned its own currency, the peso, and “dollarized” through a process starting in 1993 and finalizing in 2000. That meant El Salvador’s economy could run on a relatively reliable instrument – but also that leaders had no control over national monetary policy and were vulnerable if the dollar inflated.  On that front, at least, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele today looks outright prescient. When he first began pursuing his Bitcoin Law, dollar inflation in the U.S. was barely ticking up, and widely regarded as temporary and inconsequential. A year later, that inflation is looking like a more intractable outcome of America’s coronavirus response, with worrying implications for international dollar users. That certainly validates the general impulse to de-dollarize by any means necessary.  Unfortunately, one year on, Bitcoin is nowhere near being able to shield El Salvador from its entanglements with the dollar. BTC has failed as an inflation hedge, at least for now, and the market reversal of the last nine months means that most of the bitcoin purchased by El Salvador is underwater. Bukele’s decision to use national funds to make large speculative bets on BTC now looks particularly misguided.  Read more: Bitcoin City: El Salvador’s Dreams for Utopia on Hold  The Salvadoran bitcoin program has also seen major logistical and technical glitches. Even more disappointing, both for mainstream observers in the global North and for many bitcoiners, has been Bukele’s continued move towards authoritarian politics.  Some of these problems are to be expected given the sweeping and radical nature of the program. “Any sovereign nation that disrupts at a level as foundational as its monetary system will not do so without encountering unforeseen complications, initial gridlocks and the need for an adjustment period,” says Ian Gaines, communications director of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, which advocates for BTC adoption. Expecting such a program to reach its full potential in one year, he says, “is optimistic, to say the least.”  Things have been a mixed bag so far, in other words. But insiders argue the real payoff is down the road. So, in a reshuffled nod to director Sergio Leone (cue the Ennio Morricone music), here are the Bad, the Good and the Ugly of El Salvador’s first Bitcoin Year.  The Bad  In hindsight, the greatest failure of El Salvador’s Bitcoin rollout was the botched technical, logistical and communications aspects of the initial, apparently rushed rollout. There were widespread reports of identity theft, with many Salvadorans claiming their $30 signup bonus had been drained before they accessed the system. The specific requirements of the Bitcoin Law were also poorly communicated, particularly when it came to the requirements for merchants. Outside of El Salvador, even some bitcoiners came to see elements of the Bitcoin Law as an authoritarian imposition.  Bitcoin ATM operator Athena Bitcoin handled at least some parts of the early rollout of Chivo and its backend systems. Beginning in December, though, El Salvador transferred control to the seemingly much more seasoned vendor AlphaPoint, which has done similar work in 35 countries. But the hacks had already done a lot of damage to the broader effort.  “When you have bumps out of the gate – and it’s not uncommon for such an ambitious project – it deteriorates trust and desire to use an application,” says Igor Telyatnikov, AlphaPoint’s co-founder and CEO. “There were plenty [of Salvadorans] that used Chivo, had an issue and stopped using it as a result. … So there is a bit of rebuilding trust with the community.”  The bitcoin rollout also involved substantial financial commitments by the small country, at a time when it seems it couldn’t really afford them. Media outlets have calculated the total tab at around $425 million, with most of that going to the initial $30 BTC signup incentives, escrow pools for bitcoin-dollar conversion and a series of investments directly into bitcoin. A little arithmetic suggests the infrastructure costs were roughly $100 million.  The bitcoin investments from El Salvador’s balance sheet may constitute the most obvious misstep of the rollout – if they’re even real. Bukele and his government haven’t revealed either the on-chain or off-chain location of their supposed bitcoin buys, so we’re still largely relying on Bukele’s tweets. One calculation is that Salvadoran bitcoin investments have incurred about $50 million in unrealized losses.  Read more: El Salvador Postpones Bitcoin Bond: Report  Those investments could rebound, but El Salvador may not be able to wait very long, thanks to a national cash crunch. It has a pair of $800 million bonds due in 2023 and 2025, and observers are seriously unsure whether the nation will be able to pay those back.  That gets to the final, somewhat ambiguous Bad outcome of El Salvador’s larger bitcoin agenda. As I wrote at the time, its push to transition to bitcoin was a matter of international power politics and nose-thumbing at international finance entities like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.  It’s little surprise, then, that El Salvador’s negotiations with the IMF for a $1.3 billion emergency loan have been troubled. The IMF seems to have walked away from the negotiating table, while making noises about its distrust of bitcoin, and Salvadoran officials have been downplaying the importance of the loan. That could be very, very bad for the country’s finances given its short-term debt obligations.  On the other hand, challenging the IMF was inherent to the bitcoin agenda. The real problem is that El Salvador’s planned end-run around the IMF has also seemingly failed. The “Bitcoin Bond” would have raised $1 billion, but has been delayed multiple times and now seems indefinitely stalled. The same likely goes for a planned “Bitcoin City” the bond would have helped fund – easily the most absurd element of the Salvadoran plan.  The Good  While negativity has dominated coverage of bitcoin in El Salvador, there are bright spots. The use of bitcoin to send remittances from abroad has been validated more than many think. While the initial Chivo wallet rollout was rough, things are getting better. And the advantages for investment, education and tourism in El Salvador remain, at the very least, promising.  It was reported in May of this year that 1.9% of remittances to El Salvador, or $96.3 million, were sent via cryptocurrency in the eight months following the Bitcoin Law. That sounds like not much. And indeed, the number has been trotted out as a ding in the pieces attacking the program. But such criticism reflects a misunderstanding of adoption curves and human behavior – and more fundamentally, a misunderstanding of percentages and their stakes.  You see, Salvadorans at home and abroad reportedly spend about $400 million per year on the fees for remittances – that’s not the total amount sent, just the fees. Even a small reduction in that big tab is nothing to sneeze at. According to the World Bank, remittance fees to El Salvador averaged 2.85% in 2020 (which is already quite low in global terms). Bitcoin fees, while variable and subject to bull market spikes, are generally less than half as much, and currently stand at an average of 1.28%.  If you combine half-price fees with 1.9% of $400 million, you can see that Salvadorans saved a bit under $4 million in remittance fees by transitioning to bitcoin, just in those first eight months. That’s the equivalent of adding 1,100 average annual incomes to the small country. That does ignore the added costs of turning bitcoin into dollars, but that’s kind of the point of the attempt to transition the economy as a whole to bitcoin compatibility – Salvadorans who receive bitcoin increasingly don’t have to convert it.  If Salvadoran adoption of bitcoin for remittances accelerates at even just another 2% per year, the roughly $100 million spent on Bitcoin network infrastructure could effectively pay for itself in less than a decade.  Read more: El Salvador's Finance Minister Says Bitcoin Adoption is 'Gaining Ground': Report  Of course, for that to happen, people have to actually use the system. AlphaPoint’s takeover of the Chivo wallet and payments system could help that happen. According to CEO Telyatnikov, they’ve been working hard to make sure even less-digitally literate Salvadorans can use the app safely and reliably.  “It’s definitely a challenge,” Telyatnikov says. “There’s quite a bit of effort that goes into working with groups of people that are using the app in front of the team. There’s a product team that works with individuals, works with merchants, observes how they use the app, and makes recommendations.” Google and Apple data shows fairly frequent updates to the app since AlphaPoint’s takeover.  Other improvements are just as important, including an expansion of the Chivo customer support team and what Telyatnikov describes as a “1,000% improvement on speed” in merchant transaction processing. AlphaPoint has been particularly focused on improving the system’s integration with the high-speed Lightning Network that runs on top of Bitcoin. Though the bad impression left by the initial rollout won’t be easy to come back from, Telyatnikov thinks the improvements will eventually win back Salvadoran sentiment.  That would improve the chances for two of the Bitcoin Law’s other stated goals – improving bitcoin-driven investment and tourism in El Salvador. The tourism bet seems to have paid off, at least in the short term, with visits up 81% in 2022 compared to pre-pandemic levels, according to United Nations data. With around 5% of Salvadoran GDP generated by international tourism before the Bitcoin Law, a sustained lift of that magnitude could in itself raise El Salvador’s GDP more than 3% – a transformative change.  Though less definitive, there are also some signs that El Salvador’s higher concentration of users exposed to crypto is attracting companies to expand and operate there.  “Because the government has so publicly backed this technology by rolling out comprehensive regulations paired with education initiatives, the people in El Salvador are far ahead of many of their peers around the world,” the fintech startup Structure.fi said in a statement about its decision to expand operations and services in the country.  That could eventually translate into more companies establishing or expanding offices there – though it does raise thorny questions about what could be interpreted as Salvadorans acting as guinea pigs for startups based in more-developed countries.  Longer term, another big promise is educational. Assuming cryptocurrency demand continues to expand worldwide over the coming decade-plus, Salvadorans could be in pole position to benefit from their current exposure to Bitcoin.  “It’s kind of like in the early days of the internet, an entire country giving everyone internet access,” notes AlphaPoint’s Telyatnikov. “It’s an educational advantage – you’ll see a lot of people go down the rabbit hole and educate themselves.”  The Ugly  Many elements of El Salvador’s bitcoin rollout, then, seem to have performed better than mainstream media coverage would indicate. But that coverage has also frequently focused on Nayib Bukele’s autocratic behavior, which has in some ways worsened since the Bitcoin Law came into force. It’s genuinely troubling, even if it is arguably tangential to the question of bitcoin itself.  Some things seen as antidemocratic from America, certainly, are consequences of El Salvador’s uniquely troubled sociopolitical situation. It is still fighting back from both a long civil war and a wave of horrific gang violence – both, it must be emphasized, partly triggered by the actions of the United States. That included indoctrinating Salvadoran youth in American-style gang culture, then sending them back home to sow chaos. Some of Bukele’s strong-arm tactics may be excusable as necessary for dealing with the legacy of colonially imposed corruption and violence.  But there are limits to even that generous interpretation. For me, the bright line came as early as January of this year, when evidence emerged of the Bukele government working to silence journalists through digital surveillance. While I’m obviously biased, I find any government attempting to control the press and the flow of ideas viscerally repulsive (not least when America does it).  I wrote at the time that Nayib Bukele had shown himself unworthy of serving as a global champion for bitcoin adoption. I still believe that’s true – but it’s also somewhat irrelevant. While bizarre figures like the former RT host Max Keiser may be comfortable uncritically cozying up to anyone who says nice things about Bitcoin (RT is funded by Russia), the larger point is that bitcoin itself doesn’t care. The system and its benefits are there for anyone to use.  And despite the challenges it faces as a first mover, El Salvador’s example could still mark the way for other countries. Samson Mow, who worked on the now-stalled Bitcoin Bond as an executive at Blockstream, has since departed that role and spun up a new company called JAN3 to focus entirely on nation-state bitcoin adoption.  “We are engaged with various parties around the world and making steady progress” on other national bitcoin programs, Mow says. “It's rare to find a nation-state that will move as quickly and with as much conviction as El Salvador. I'm confident that we will see more nation-state adoption happening, but it will be a gradual process that takes time.”  In short, it takes more than a year to really understand the consequences of a change as radical as El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment. What happens over the next year, or five, will likely be much more important to whether history views Nayib Bukele and his laser-eyed conversion as a woeful screwup – or as a visionary coup.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

As a result, many mining companies have temporarily closed their mining operations until the endeavor becomes profitable for them again. Combining the falling Bitcoin price with the Ethereum network upgrade to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) means that cryptocurrency mining profitability is taking a double hit. Typically, miners either mine a blockchain directly with their own mining equipment or will pool their resources together in a mining pool to find blocks and secure the network. Unfortunately, the profitability of both strategies has suffered dramatically as the price of Bitcoin falls. However, besides mining directly and in a pool, there is another method to make money with mining in 2022. This new method doesn&apos;t require miners to invest in expensive mining equipment, nor does it require miners to educate themselves on the technical jargon needed to join mining pools. Instead, this new mining method involves investing in an NFT or a coin that uses mining revenues to generate value. The pioneer in this space is about to launch its NFT before its protocol goes live.

42421455,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoMdJ,1663266267,Ethereum PoW Is Not an Ethereum Competitor,"Ethereum, the world’s most active cryptocurrency network, just fired all of its miners. In a much-anticipated event you may have heard of called the Merge, Ethereum devs “switched out the engine of a moving car” to do away with the energy intensive process of securing blockchains known as proof-of-work (PoW).  That means scores of specially designed graphics chips, called ASICs (or application-specific integrated circuits), need to be pointed elsewhere if their owners – individuals, institutions and mining pools – want to churn a profit. There are only a few blockchains that use a similar-enough hashing function to Ethereum that could benefit from the estimated $5 billion worth of EtHash ASIC hardware in existence.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Already it seems that Ethereum Classic, a version of Ethereum that split from the “canonical chain” in 2016, has been a big winner. Ethereum Classic has seen its network hash power jump about 300% last night to closer to 300 terra hashes per second (TH/s) today, according to data site 2miners. (Hash power is the amount of computational energy used to secure a PoW crypto network.)  See also: Proof-of-Work vs. Proof-of-Stake: What Is the Difference?  Other, smaller, mostly inconsequential, chains like Ravencoin and Ergo have also seen massive spikes in hash power and the price of their native tokens. It remains to be seen whether this is a sustainable rally, considering the limited number of things you can do with – or reasons to build around – RVN and ERG.  Nowhere is the balancing act between the market price for a crypto token and the amount of energy people are willing to expend to earn those tokens clearer than in the alternative proof-of-work Ethereum fork aptly named ETHPOW.  The latest, buzziest Ethereum fork – “designed” by veteran Ethereum miner, initial coin offering (ICO) pitchman and principal architect of Ethereum Classic, Chandler Guo – was set up to benefit from the Ethereum Merge. Through promises of an airdrop (free money for ether holders) and charisma, Guo managed to convince at least 19 former Ethereum mining pools to continue mining his new chain.  Its token, ETHW, rallied from $35 to $60 in the hours following the network’s launch shortly after the Merge, before dropping to around $20 currently. This likely isn’t surprising to the number of people who predicted ETHPOW would come dead on arrival.  Although there could actually be a post-Merge market fit for a smart contract blockchain that utilizes mining (considering the top fleet of such chains from Solana to Cardano all use a variation of PoS), many have said ETHPoW is more of a cash grab. Despite seemingly large trading interest (or at least interest in the airdrop), few exchanges jumped to list the coin. Tether said it would integrate the chain and many a crypteratto warned it would “fracture” the Ethereum community.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Critics noted ETHPoW failed to build basic blockchain infrastructure like a wallet or a block explorer before launch. Igor Artamonov, a former Ethereum Classic developer, questioned the chain’s branding, which seemed to sell itself on the idea of saving those poor, recently chainless miners, rather than something collectively important like proof-of-work’s tried and true security guarantees.  But the real reason the network will likely struggle to take off is that much of Ethereum’s insanely valuable decentralized finance (DeFi) economy may not follow the fork. That is, seemingly, both by choice and in some cases necessity for many DeFi protocols due to broken oracles.  Although many of Ethereum’s loudest boosters seemed to be championing the demise of ETH PoW before it even started – because the alternative chain could suck capital and developer talent from the Ethereum Foundation-approved network – it was probably never accurate to say Ethereum PoW was a competitor of Ethereum.  See also: Crypto Miner F2Pool Mined the Last-Ever PoW Ether Block  What it is, instead, is a competitor to Ethereum Classic, which forked in 2016. It’s a competitor for hashpower, for hardware. Its token, which is listed on a few exchanges including Poloniex and Gate.io (with futures trading on Binance and FTX), is a competitor for attention and dollars.  Ethereum Classic itself was never much of a contender for Ethereum’s throne. The network was hit with 51% attacks multiple times in the previous years, because the network struggled to pay for its own security because its token’s price was in the doldrums because few people (besides CoinDesk owner Barry Silbert) supported the network.  Post-Merge Ethereum Classic now has an overabundance of network miners. But it’s still unclear whether the token price can rise high enough for all of those ASICs to be profitable. Before the Merge, it was estimated Ethereum’s hashing power was 15 times higher than Ethereum Classic. That’s a lot of computing power to absorb, even if split between ETH PoW and the other PoW beneficiaries.  Proof-of-work networks need valuable tokens to make it worthwhile to mine, but it also needs developers and users.

The overhaul cut Ethereum’s energy use by 99.988% and carbon-dioxide emissions by 99.992%. The decrease means the network now spews out less carbon dioxide (CO2) than a few hundred U.S. households do during a full year of electricity use, according to a new report from the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute (CCRI).  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  ""We're delighted to have commissioned this report from CCRI, which substaniates the Ethereum Merge's impact as likely the biggest decarbonization effort of any industry in history,"" ConsenSys founder Jospeh Lubin, who also co-founded Ethereum, said in a statement.  The long-awaited Merge muscled out crypto miners from running Ethereum, doing away with a system called proof-of-work (PoW) in favor of a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism, which doesn't require vast server farms running complex computations and thus consumes a lot of electricity. The amount of energy guzzled by PoW, which is how Bitcoin and other blockchains still operate, has come under extreme scrutiny from lawmakers and policymakers around the world.  Before its transition to PoS, a single Ethereum transaction used 200.05 kilowatt hours (kWh) of electricity, comparable to how much the average U.S. household uses in 6.7 days, according to one estimate.  Read more: Environmental Groups to Spend Another $1M on Ads for Bitcoin Code Change After the Merge  Bitcoin still uses PoW, drawing criticism from environmentalists and policymakers. However, some bitcoin advocates have argued that bitcoin mining uses a larger mix of renewable energy than other industries and can actually help the world transition to cleaner energy.  Michael Saylor, who has turned MicroStrategy from a software developer into a corporate bitcoin vault, argued Wednesday in a letter that bitcoin mining is “the most efficient, cleanest industrial use of electricity.”  The Merge not only could help the environment, it could also lure more money to Ethereum from ESG investors – those who only invest in companies and industries that achieve certain environmental, social and corporate-governance goals. Investors barred from buying tokens that run on PoW systems may be able to buy ETH, Ethereum’s native token, after the PoS switch, Bank of America said in a report this week.  However, miners that were mining ether (ETH) prior to the Merge have now switched to mining other PoW-based digital assets, such as Ethereum Classic, Ravencoin and Beam.

42422330,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jyZh,1663262680,Lido’s Staked Ether Surges Closest to Ether Since Terra Crash,"Ether’s (ETH) largest staking derivative token surged toward parity Thursday as traders breathed more easily that the Merge, Ethereum’s technology transition to proof-of-stake, had gone smoothly.  The price of Lido’s staked ether (stETH) token jumped sharply to 0.99 ETH from 0.97 following the Merge earlier Thursday, according to data by Coinmarketcap. This is the smallest price spread between stETH and ETH in four months, and a remarkable comeback from a week ago when the token fell to 0.95.  Lido Finance, the largest Ethereum liquid staking service provider, allows crypto investors to lock up (stake) ETH on Ethereum's proof-of-stake blockchain to earn rewards. But stakers cannot unlock and redeem their ETH until another software update, the Shanghai upgrade, whose timing is still unknown. So Lido gives investors a tradable variant (stETH) of the locked coins.  “The successful completion of the Merge has alleviated the immediate risk that came with holding liquid staking tokens, causing a near instant recovery in prices,” Clara Medalie, research director at crypto market research firm Kaiko, told CoinDesk.  Crypto traders have closely watched the price spread between stETH and ETH as an important metric to assess the risk associated with the Merge.  “The spread between stETH and ETH is one of the best indicators of confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem, specifically the Merge and subsequent developments,” Ilan Solot, partner at Tagus Capital, wrote in a newsletter Thursday morning. “Well, the discount has narrowed sharply, and we are back to pre-Terra collapse levels.”  Read more: Price Discount on 'stETH' Reflects Some Doubt on Smooth Ethereum Merge  StETH traded at parity with ETH before it “de-pegged” following the Terra blockchain’s multibillion-dollar collapse, which kick-started a liquidity crisis in the crypto industry and made traders increasingly risk-averse. The spread opened as wide as 7%-8% in May and stabilized around the 3% level until the Merge.  Another symptom of investor’s fear of the Merge was the imbalance of an exchange pool on decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve, which is the main platform to swap stETH tokens to ETH.  During the months leading up to the Merge, and as the pool’s size significantly shrank, there were times when stETH made up 75% of all tokens in the pool, while ETH represented only 25%.  The imbalance hindered traders from selling their stETH tokens, and made it impossible for large stETH holders such as insolvent crypto lender Celsius Network and hedge fund Three Arrows Capital to convert the derivative holdings to more liquid assets, contributing to their failure.  The Curve pool’s balance has improved since the Merge with stETH now standing at 65% of all tokens and ETH at 35%, a ratio rarely seen since June.  “Traders and liquidity providers quickly re-entered secondary liquid staking markets following the Merge, although it will be about six months before stakers can retrieve their staked ETH,” Kaiko’s Medalie said.

The sudden price dump looks like a ""buy-the-rumor, sell-the-fact"" response, said Riyad Carey, a research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko.  “There is still a lot of leverage in ETH markets, so volatility should be expected and will probably be welcomed by traders who watched the Merge go by without much of a move up or down,” Carey told CoinDesk in a written note. “We’ve also seen market depth decrease and spreads increase, so that will likely factor into larger price movements.”  The 'Ethereum Merge trade' unwinds  CoinDesk reported earlier on blockchain data showing that investors were sending ETH to crypto exchanges in droves – often taken as a sign that holders are getting ready to dump. The cumulative inflow of $1.2 billion was the largest in six months.  By most accounts, the Ethereum blockchain appears to have dodged major technological snafus that might have led to a much deeper price crash.  “Many believe that the Merge might make Ethereum faster or cheaper,"" Will Harborne, founder and CEO of the rhino.fi protocol, told CoinDesk. ""This is not the case. For end users or developers, there should be no noticeable difference between Ethereum before and after the Merge.”  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Data from crypto futures markets shows that many investors appear to have closed out hedged positions in the hours after the Merge went through – a sign that they are wrapping up trades they had made during the previous month or past few weeks to bet on possible outcomes of the event – including the possibility of a revolt by crypto miners who want to keep working on a ""proof-of-work"" system similar to Bitcoin's, which Ethereum used until early Thursday.  Some investors were jockeying to maximize their rewards from a new ""airdropped token"" from whatever proof-of-work change continues on, referred to colloquially as ETHPOW.  “I think that you wouldn’t have to throw many rocks to find a fund that has a healthy nine-figure position on the Merge, long spot short derivatives or something like that,"" said Abraham Chaibi, co-founder of Dexterity Capital. ""They’re going to unwind, that’s definitely going to happen.”  Meanwhile, the price of Ethereum Classic's ETC token – thr native token of another proof-of-work blockchain that some miners see as a viable alternative – was down 2% to $36.34.  Ether options  In the crypto options market, traders were selling out of contracts designed to profit from high volatility. Ironically, that volatility is arriving now.  “ETH peaked at $2,000 one month ago and has seen a sharp drop today once the Merge was deemed successful. The market had priced in a successful Merge, and so far this seems to have come to fruition,"" Marc Arjoon, a research associate at CoinShares, said.  “The level of asymmetric information around the Merge creates several pockets of narratives, so I expect a lot of volatility. Investors should definitely be cautious, as always, and expect volatility in price and narrative,"" he added.  In the two-week run-up to the Merge, the price of ether was up 4%, but it remains down 16% on the month, according to market data.  Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin had been quoted on the ""Bankless"" podcast as saying the Merge was “not going to be priced in pretty much until after it happens.”  According to EtherNodes, 88% of ether nodes were Merge-ready and synced in the moments leading up to the event. In total, 12%, or 305, nodes appeared to be recalcitrant, with the transition with the majority from the Geth network.  'Volatility for at least the next 24 hours'  “Although it (the Merge) happened without any technical hitches, there are also some other undercurrents, such as the new EthereumPoW (ETHW) network, a new form off of the old Ethereuem that will retain mining,” Bitbull Capital CEO Joe DiPasquale told CoinDesk in an email. “We expect this volatility for at least the next 24 hours.”  Investors were quick to point out that crypto markets remain under the shadow of the crash earlier this year, and bitcoin in particular, which often dictates the overall industry's price direction, is under pressure from monetary-policy tightening at the U.S. Federal Reserve.  In the weeks before the Merge, bitcoin and ether appeared to be traveling on separate trajectories. It's possible that ether might now recouple with its larger rival's price action.  “If this happened last year, we’d be at $8,000 already,” March Zheng, a Shanghai-based partner at Bizantine Capital, said to CoinDesk via WeChat.  Brent Xu, founder and CEO at Cosmos-based borrowing and lending platform Umee, said despite some choppiness in the market environment, he has a bullish outlook on Ethereum’s growth in the long term with the network’s switch to PoS, versus bitcoin remaining a good store of value.  “Think of cars. All the engines are like gasoline engines. It wasn’t until the first electric engine was created that cars can go really fast and for long amounts of time. And this is the same with crypto,” he told CoinDesk in a video interview. “First, we have proof-of-work, which is like gasoline engines. But now Ethereum is the first protocol to have a big upgrade to use electric engines, and the possibilities with electric engines are so much bigger. And this is the moment ... it can skyrocket in terms of value, new dynamics, scalability, interoperability and privacy.”  Oliver Knight contributed to this report.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,"Jocelyn Yang, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/pivotal-ethereum-merge-brings-sell-the-fact-price-move-in-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e98744a982a3ed5ad26d4ae31379f0b5583522bd-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422315,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jyBh,1663259090,"Digital Euro Must Be Green, Private and Possibly Capped, National Officials Say","A digital euro should keep people’s details private, be environmentally friendly and potentially be subject to caps on holdings, officials from the five leading nations in the currency zone said in a leaked paper seen by CoinDesk.  The European Central Bank (ECB) is currently considering whether to issue its currency in digital form, and a bill is due early next year that could form the legal basis.  The “digital euro could play a vital role to strengthen the strategic autonomy of the European Union and to foster financial sector innovation,” said the paper, authored by senior Treasury officials from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands and dated Sept. 13.  The central bank digital currency (CBDC) was first put forward as a way to stop foreign, private sector players like Facebook from usurping the state’s role in issuing currency with its own stablecoin, known first as libra and then renamed diem.  The digital euro should not replace cash, and should also complement private sector means of payment such as digital money issued by commercial banks, the paper said.  ECB officials have said the digital currency will start out by looking at people-based applications like payments among friends and in stores, and should only use blockchain technology if it’s deemed speedy and secure enough. The Dutch government has argued the currency shouldn’t be able to be programmed – since determining how a coin can be used in advance in effect reduces its value.  Officials are, for now, skirting around those questions, saying merely that “a political discussion is needed on which functionalities and underlying technologies the digital euro should be based on,” with the CBDC a building block for further innovation.  “A digital euro would need to allow for financial privacy,” the paper added, echoing a discussion which took place with ECB officials earlier in the year. “In general terms, the identity of payers and payees shall not be disclosed to the central bank or to third-party intermediaries that are not involved in the transaction, except on the basis of [European] Union law.”  The officials also appear to back a suggestion by ECB Executive Board Member Fabio Panetta that people’s holdings of the CBDC could be limited, either through lower interest rates or hard caps, to stop money flowing out of the conventional banking system.  “We look forward to further robust and quantitative analysis on mechanisms to mitigate the impact of a digital euro on the financing of the economy, including but not limited to caps and tiered remuneration,” the paper said.  The officials also appear to intervene in a fraught debate over the environmental impact of certain crypto technology, including the proof-of-work validation mechanism that underpins bitcoin. On Thursday, the Ethereum blockchain completed its transition to the greener alternative, proof-of-stake.  “A digital euro also needs to be environmentally sustainable by design,” the paper said.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jack Schickler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/15/digital-euro-must-be-green-private-and-possibly-capped-national-officials-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a1fe590d10e9d1d75e1c1d79bfcd77f81354189-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Some of the addresses have been active as recently as this week.  Telegram records indicate that at least four of the addresses are linked to a military hardware crowdfunding campaign to help resupply pro-Russian troops that retreated during Ukraine's offensive in the northeast. The units took heavy casualties during their retreat, one of the posts said.  The sanctions were part of a broader list of additions to the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)’s Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list tied to Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine.  The tether address is tied to USDT issued on the Tron blockchain.  According to the Treasury Department, Task Force Rusich is a “neo-Nazi paramilitary group” that has been in combat in Ukraine.  “In 2015, Rusich mercenaries were accused of, and filmed, committing atrocities against deceased and captured Ukrainian soldiers. Rusich is associated with OFAC-designated groups Private Military Company Wagner and Interregional Social Organization Union of Donbas Volunteers,” Treasury said in a press release.

But the market isn’t valuing “The Last POW Block” as much as its creators likely did, at least so far.  VanityBlocks, a relatively new NFT collection, paid some 30 ether, or just over $48,000, in fees to crypto miner F2Pool, which mined the final transaction, to mint the NFT, paying some 1.3 ether (ETH) as transaction fees. However, the NFT had received just three bids as of Thursday at roughly 15:00 UTC, with the highest bidder, OpenSea user “lossy-eth,” offering just 10 ether. Lossy’s bid was about five times that offered by Nostalgia_NFT, which bid just 2 ether. Meanwhile, “cryptogle” bid just 0.5 ether. All three bids are currently active on VanityBlocks’ OpenSea page.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  VanityBlocks publishes transactional data onto an entire block – a novelty that allows holders to effectively ""own"" a block. Blocks are datasets where transactional data in a blockchain are permanently recorded and contain some or all of the most recent transactions on that network.  The project even included a quote by American ethnobotanist Terence McKenna in the final PoW transaction: ""Make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, it will lift you up. This is the trick.”  VanityBlocks' founder ""monkeyontheloose.eth"" remains unfazed, however, by the low bids. He told CoinDesk in a Twitter message that the project only had a ""15% chance to actually mint that block and still managed to do it,"" adding that the U.S. East Coast was only just waking up – meaning the NFT was likely to see much more bidding attention as the day progressed.  Meanwhile, the first NFTs minted on the proof-of-stake Ethereum network aren’t attracting much interest either.  Creators behind “The Transition” collection, which hopes to “mark a milestone on the path towards decentralization,” paid some 36 ether, or over $53,000, in transaction fees this morning to mint the first-ever NFTs on Ethereum after the Merge.  NFTs of this collection have received bids of only up to 1.76 ether, or just over $2,300, data from the collection’s site shows.

42422314,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jy9h,1663252200,Token Management Platform Magna Raises $15M Seed Round at $70M Valuation,"Token management platform Magna closed a $15 million seed round at a $70 million valuation led by venture capital firms Tiger Global and Tusk Venture Partners, co-founders Bruno Faviero and Arun Kirubarajan told CoinDesk.  Other participants in the round included Shima Capital, Circle Ventures, Solana Ventures, Polygon Ventures, Avalanche Labs, Alchemy Ventures and Galaxy Digital. Individual investors included ex-Coinbase executive Balaji Srinivasan, Messari’s Ryan Selkis and DJ Steve Aoki.  Magna is building token distribution software that makes it easier for protocols, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) and crypto funds to send and receive tokens, a process that has so far lacked automation and has been prone to error.  “Crypto founders want their stakeholders to get their tokens on-time, correctly, and in a compliant way,” said Faviero, CEO of Magna. “We started Magna to make it easier to start and scale crypto companies, and this is one less thing they have to worry about.”  Faviero says basic infrastructure for Web3 projects – such as token management software – is still lacking compared to the tools available to Web2 technology companies. In Web3, tokens have become the new unit of ownership, and are transacted via blockchains and wallet addresses.  ""Magna is solving a pain point that many founders and organizations face today when managing tokens for employees and various stakeholders,"" said Jordan Nof, Managing Partner and Co-Founder at Tusk Venture Partners. ""Token issuances can create a powerful incentive for stakeholders, but managing the process is still highly manual. Bruno and the team at Magna are creating a platform that will change the future of how companies plan, manage, and execute token distributions.""  Additionally, projects frequently use tokens to conduct airdrops, participate in governance and distribute as payment to investors, all of which requires more sophisticated, crypto-native tooling.  “At Shima, we have hundreds of portfolio companies and several have tried to build token distribution mechanisms in-house to no avail,” said Yida Gao, general partner at Shima Capital. “These tools should exist as a primitive and require battle-tested smart contract code, extensive security audits, and a usable interface to get right.”  UPDATE (Sept. 15, 2022 14:35 UTC) – Adds Polygon Ventures to list of investors in second paragraph.

42422319,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy0jyHh,1663250400,"CFTC Already Preparing to Be Crypto Watchdog, Behnam Tells US Senators","Rostin Behnam, the head of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said he has already directed his agency to begin preparing to be the major, fully funded regulator for much of the crypto market, as anticipated in Senate legislation.  “The volatility in the market, and its impact on retail customers – which may only worsen under current macroeconomic conditions – emphasizes the immediate need for regulatory clarity and market protections,” Behnam is set to tell members of the Senate Agriculture Committee in testimony set for delivery on Thursday. A bill being pushed by committee leaders to create new rules for the crypto industry, putting Behnam’s agency at the center of federal oversight, recognizes “the CFTC’s expertise and experience make it the right regulator for the digital asset commodity market,” he added.  Committee Chairwoman Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) unveiled legislation last month with the panel’s ranking Republican, Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), that would give the agency substantial reach to regulate digital assets trading, including authorizing the CFTC to oversee crypto spot markets.  However, it wouldn’t let the agency define which tokens it would police, still giving the courts and the Securities and Exchange Commission leeway to figure out which assets would be defined as SEC-regulated securities.  Still, Behnam praised the legislation and its plan for additional agency funding that will allow the CFTC to “move swiftly” to establish the new oversight over digital commodity assets, which the courts, lawmakers and regulators conceded includes bitcoins, though other assets’ status are less clear. “All digital commodity platforms must maintain adequate financial, operational, and managerial resources, segregate customer funds, and comply with commission requirements for the treatment of customer assets,” Behnam said. “These tools have proven effective in preserving customer funds and market operations in times of instability, uncertainty, or market misconduct.”  This Senate panel only has sway over the CFTC, and the Stabenow-Boozman bill stuck to that jurisdiction, unlike other efforts that have sought more sweeping regulations for the industry. Stabenow noted that keeping the bill in a single committee streamlines its ability to reach the Senate floor for a wider vote.  ""This is a glaring hole in our financial system, and I believe we must close it,"" Stabenow said during the hearing, agreeing with Behnam that the CFTC is the ""right regulator"" for this work. ""This is a big responsibility with a lot at stake.""  One aspect of the bill would call for the agency to examine the environmental problem of high energy usage in crypto mining, though Behnam nodded toward the Ethereum Merge as a positive sign.  ""An event occurred last night with Ethereum that which is going to reduce energy consumption -- a step in the right direction but certainly not resolving the problem,"" he said  Similar legislation has been introduced in the House, but the legislative session is waning as midterm elections approach, leaving little time for bills to clear Congress before the end of the year. However, multiple bills have now suggested the CFTC take a central position in crypto oversight, and that momentum is expected to continue as the efforts get closer to the finish line.  Behnam said his agency, with a current budget of about $320 million a year, would need an extra $112 million for the first three years of putting this new oversight into place. The legislation would set up industry fees to pay for that extra cost, which would largely come from training and hiring people to handle the new crypto workload.  Several figures from the crypto industry also testified before the committee on Thursday, including representatives from U.S. crypto platform Coinbase and trading giant Citadel Securities.  ""We are at a crossroads when it comes to crypto,"" said Christine Parker, a vice president and deputy general counsel for Coinbase. She asked the lawmakers to set a clearer border between commodities and securities in the bill, arguing it could ""be strengthened by further defining digital asset commodities to ensure assets that do not meet the definition of securities are regulated by the CFTC and not by enforcement through the SEC.""  The Blockchain Association, a Washington-based crypto advocacy group, agrees with that point, including it among a list of concerns the association outlined in a Thursday statement. The Stabenow-Boozman effort's definition of digital commodities is ""too narrow and vague and must be clarified to draw a clear dividing line between the CFTC and SEC."" The group also contends the bill could threaten decentralized finance (DeFi) by ""applying the same rules to centralized intermediaries and decentralized protocols.""

Chart of the Day: Bitcoin's mean net inflows surge to a six-year high.  This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Price Point  Ethereum’s historic change of the way it processes transactions went live early Thursday without any hiccup, disappointing traders positioned for a spurt in volatility.  The Merge, marking the network’s shift to a more energy-efficient ""proof-of-stake,"" happened at 6:43 UTC, following which ether (ETH) witnessed a short-lived spike from $1,600 to $1,655. At press time, bitcoin (BTC) and ether were trading flat on the day.  ""Happy Merge Day. Historic day in Crypto as the Merge completes successfully and somewhat uneventfully, which is a testament to ETH Devs,"" over-the-counter institution-focused tech platform Paradigm said in its Telegram broadcast, taking note of subdued price action and a drop in ether's implied volatility or expectations for price turbulence.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Stock futures pointed to a second day of calmer trading as investors weighed in recent indications that the Federal Reserve will have to take tougher action to combat inflation than many had hoped.  “I still think we have not seen the bottom in crypto markets. After the higher-than-expected inflation numbers, the terminal rate has been adjusted from previous 3.5% to 4%, which means that there is still a long way to go in interest rate hikes,” said Pablo Jódar, an independent crypto analyst.  “Obviously, this is not good for growth stocks nor crypto, as higher interest rates reduce demand for risky assets. We need to see a meaningful change in inflation data to see a reversal in market tendency.”  Ethereum classic (ETC) and Lido DAO (LDO) were trading up 5.7% on the day.  Ether futures market discount evaporates after the Merge  CoinDesk’s Omkar Godbole reported that the month-long ether futures market anomaly that stemmed predominantly from traders looking to profit from Ethereum's technological change, the Merge, has reversed.  Ether futures have almost caught up with the cryptocurrency's underlying spot price following the historic overhaul of the way Ethereum verifies transactions.  The annualized rolling discount in one-month bitcoin futures listed on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, narrowed to 0.3% from 17.66% before the changeover, which went live at 6:43 UTC, according to data provided by Skew.  Ether moves to centralized exchanges  A large amount of ether was moved to centralized exchanges ahead of the Merge.  Cryptocurrency lender deposited 450,000 ETH worth $720 million to leading digital assets exchange Binance late Wednesday, according to data tweeted by Nansen's CEO Alex Svanevik. While crypto exchange Bitfinex received 288,442 ETH worth $490 million.  The cumulative inflow of $1.2 billion is supposedly the largest in six months. The total number of ETH held in centralized exchange wallets has jumped to a two-month high of 25.34 million.

Market Moves  Ether's Implied Volatility Slides as Merge Goes Smooth  By Omkar Godbole  Ether's one- and three-month implied volatility (IV) gauges have come off sharply from Tuesday's high as Ethereum's much-anticipated technological change of how its blockchain verifies transactions went smooth early today.  ""The large volatility event did not happen, and once the first block was finalized for the proof-of-stake chain IVs started to come off,"" Markus Thielen, chief investment officer at BritishVirgin Islands-based IDEG Asset Management, said.  ""The ease of short-term risk aversion has caused the IV of short tenor options to drop significantly, Griffin Ardern, a volatility trader from crypto asset management firm Blofin, said. Tenor refers to the length of time remaining before a financial contract expires.  Ahead of Ethereum's so-called Merge, some traders were worried that the upgrade may run into last-minute problems, injecting volatility into markets. So traders had bought short-term puts or options offering protection from price drops, Thielen told CoinDesk.  However, once the Merge went smoothly, ether held steady and the puts bought in anticipation of volatility began bleeding money, forcing traders to square off their positions.  That led to a drop in the implied volatility. A rise in demand for options lifts IV, and vice versa.  Chart of The Day  Bitcoin's Mean Net Inflows Surge to a Six-Year High  By Omkar Godbole  The spread between the mean amount of BTC per transaction sent to the exchange and the mean amount withdrawn from the exchange rose to 0.84 early this week, hitting the highest in six years, according to data sourced from Glassnode.  The data indicates investors depositing lot of coins on centralized exchanges is increasing.  Exchange inflows are often taken to represent investor intention to sell.

Earlier on Thursday, the Ethereum network switched from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus algorithm to proof-of-stake (PoS). This move, known as the Merge, was planned years in advance but faced many delays.  Ergo also more than doubled, from 22.42 terahash/second (TH/s) around 6 a.m. UTC on Thursday, to almost 70 TH/s at around 2 p.m. UTC, according to mining pool 2Miners.com.  The Merge put an end to the need of miners to keep up the network using thousands of computers. Miners who had invested in hardware to mine ether are now likely looking for other uses for their hardware, and PoW tokens like Ethereum Classic's ETC and Ravencoin's RVN are among the available options.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Ethereum Classic was formed after the DAO hack in 2016, which prompted a hard network fork that split the Ethereum blockchain into two. The original chain continued as Ethereum Classic, while the new one was called Ethereum.  The hashrate on Ethereum Classic, which continues with proof-of-work, grew from 70.5 terahash/second (TH/s) at 6 a.m. UTC on Thursday, before the Merge was finalized, to 158.3 TH/s at 1 p.m. on the same day, data from CoinWarz shows. On Ravencoin, the hashrate grew from 8.9 Th/s to 15.9 TH/s in the same time period.  Beam (BEAM) has almost tripled in the past 24 hours. Other PoW tokens that already have a sizable mining community including monero (XMR), litecoin (LTC) and zcash (ZEC) don't show any identifiable trends in the run up or after the Merge.

In simple but perhaps poorly understood terms, Ethereum has gone from a cryptocurrency token backed by a proof-of-work blockchain to one supported by a proof-of-stake blockchain.  This process required the help of a proof-of-stake chain called Beacon, which had been developing in parallel with the Ethereum blockchain since 2020. Though Beacon did not formerly process transactions, it had acted as a testing ground that allowed for a smooth transition to the PoS upgrade.  Full transition to PoS required that Ethereum’s PoW mainnet, or Execution Layer, merge with Ethereum’s Beacon Chain, or Consensus Layer.  “The best diagram I’ve seen looks sort of like what you see in subway stations,” said Richard Smith, CEO of fintech investing tool RiskSmith and a specialist on market risk and uncertainty. “You have maps of subway lines, and sometimes two lines run in parallel and one line kind of ends at a common station and everybody who was on that line has to move over to the line that continues on if they want to go further. That is, in a nutshell, what happens to Ethereum when the Merge occurs.”  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  The problem with proof-of-work  Like Bitcoin before it, Ethereum was built upon a proof-of-work blockchain in which transactions are verified by a network of computers working to solve cryptographic problems.  While a proof-of-work blockchain can create a secure, highly dispersed network of miners who are compensated for the work of their computers with tokens, it also requires a very high level of energy expenditure.  At the same time, the heavy energy drain of proof-of-work blockchains was a feature, not a bug, according to Omid Malekan, a Columbia Business School professor, crypto expert and author of ""Re-Architecting Trust: The Curse of History and the Crypto Cure for Money, Markets, and Platforms.""  “The goal was to be able to control who is updating and curating a digital ledger while still being decentralized,” Malekan said. “So mining was an ingenious and complicated solution involving volunteers who proved their honest intent by wasting money consuming energy. The energy has nothing to do with running the blockchain, it’s a way of using a financial incentive to net out an honest outcome that can lead to a secure system. And it has worked.”  Watch: Ethereum Merge: Five Things to Know  How proof-of-stake will work  In a proof-of-stake blockchain, participants can loan their tokens to the network and earn a yield on their money. In Ethereum’s case, after the Merge anyone with at least 32 ether (ETH) tokens can establish themselves as a validator on the token’s network and earn a yield of 5%-10%.  Instead of making people burn untold amounts of electricity, proof-of-stake makes network participants put some of their money in what is essentially escrow to prove their honest intent.  The transition greatly impacts the risk-reward characteristics of Ethereum. Being able to generate a guaranteed yield from Ethereum removes some of the market risk of the investment, according to Smith.  At the same time, there is still capital at risk. “You can’t think of it like a CD where at least you know you’ll get your principal back,” Smith said. “You have to ask whether it’s worth 4%-5% to bet on the price of Ethereum now.”  Read more: Ethereum Merge Explained: What Investors Should Know About the Shift to Proof-of-Stake  Drawbacks of proof-of-stake  Despite the potential benefits of proof-of-stake, especially decreased energy usage, there are at least a couple caveats.  For starters, there’s still some degree of debate over the consequences of the new energy expenditure. With the Merge, there may or may not be a lower environmental impact from Ethereum and it’s not really clear whether that will actually happen, according to Malekan.  Also, a frequent critique of proof-of-stake blockchains is that they are too easy to corner. If a large investor stakes a large number of transactions early in the blockchain’s existence, they can dominate the staking and verification functions on the network, which theoretically could provide vulnerabilities for bad actors to exploit.  Similarly, proof-of-stake blockchains can also be inherently centralizing. Large investors can get into networks early, stake the largest sums of currency and then get more income than anyone else.  That said, in Ethereum’s case, starting with a proof-of-work protocol allowed its network to grow and expand to the point where it is not easily dominated by any one person or group of actors.  Read more: Top Questions About Proof-of-Stake and Staking Answered  Alternatives to proof-of-stake  Smith believes there are other solutions to make energy-heavy, proof-of-work blockchains more efficient.  One example is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision, or BSV. BSV is a descendent of the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin forked and created Bitcoin Cash, or BCH. BCH later forked again, creating BSV. BSV reduces energy costs by increasing the block sizes that miners work through. The trade-off is that participants in the BSV network have to make a much larger investment to be miners.  The advantages of proof-of-stake  A couple aspects of the transition to proof-of-stake could add value to the Ethereum network and its token over the long term and attract investment.  First, despite any debate of environmental impact, there could be a clear monetary impact from the transition.  “What will happen is a significant drop in Ethereum inflation in part because you’re no longer having people waste billions of their dollars on electricity,” Malekan said. “Thus, you don’t need to mint as many coins to reward them for their work. And this makes Ethereum more appealing to many institutional investors because staking is something anyone can do.”  Moving to proof-of-stake may also make it easier for layer 2, or companion blockchain, products to be built on the Ethereum blockchain, which over the long term could increase the value of the network and its token, according to Malekan.  But, like it or not, the Merge has happened. And only time will tell exactly what the immediate and long-term consequences of it will be.  “Ethereum is taking a different approach, and it’s definitely an experiment worth running,” Smith said.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETH | BSV,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | BSV,Christopher Robbins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/09/15/the-ethereum-merge-finally-happened-so-what,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/66621504e0a75b78eb4dc329c1eb31eed6f18245-6717x4483.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ethereum Classic Hash Rate According to data from mining pool 2Miners, the hash rate of Ethereum Classic has increased by 500% during the past 30 days. With the PoS upgrade, mining is no longer necessary for Ethereum. So, Ethereum&apos;s successful switch from a Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake consensus caused the hash rate to skyrocket. Ethereum miners had spent billions of dollars on mining hardware before the Merge. Therefore, Ethereum&apos;s hash rate was anticipated to transfer to other Proof-of-Work chains after the Merge.

Traders of futures tracking the two tokens took on some $80 million in cumulative losses, with ether futures seeing $67 million in liquidations, according to the data.  Ether swung between the $1,570 and $1,620 levels, with funding rates hitting sixteen-month highs as shorts – or bets against a price rise – gained favor among traders.  Funding rates are periodic payments made by traders based on the difference between prices in the futures and spot markets. Depending on their open positions, traders will either pay or receive funding.  The payments ensure there are always participants on both sides of the trade. Traders use sophisticated strategies to collect funding rates while hedging losses due to price movements – which creates market dynamics that contribute to price volatility.  ETC futures, on the other hand, saw some $22 million in liquidations – a higher-than-usual figure. The Ethereum Classic blockchain continues to operate as a proof-of-work (PoW) network, and some are betting on its long-term rise versus the now proof-of-stake (PoS) ETH.

42416239,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucI75,1663244100,Meet 8 Ethereum Developers Who Helped Make the Merge Possible,"Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s original vision for the network always included a future transition from proof-of-work (PoW), its old miner-based system for processing transactions, to proof-of-stake (PoS), a new, greener method for powering things behind the scenes.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Buterin helped establish the Ethereum Foundation (EF), a Swiss non-profit dedicated to the development of the Ethereum ecosystem, but neither he nor the foundation were solely responsible for architecting the network’s massive shift away from crypto mining. Instead, scores of individual developers, researchers, client teams and volunteers spent thousands of hours over the years, working out the nitty-gritty technicalities of how the shift could be accomplished.  Here are eight developers out of hundreds who have worked tirelessly to design, build and test Ethereum’s biggest upgrade ever: “the Merge.”  Read more: Ethereum Merge: What You Need to Know  Tim Beiko  Beiko has been the protocol support lead at EF since January 2021. He’s often seen leading the agenda of Ethereum’s All Core Developers Calls, a bi-weekly meetup of the network’s main engineers.  What he did: Beiko was in charge of coordinating the client teams, volunteers and those who work with EF. Typically, Beiko is seen leading discussions for the various EF calls.  The Merge can ""genuinely onboard people who are interested in Ethereum but were skeptical of the environmental impacts.""  What’s next: Beiko shared that there’s a lot to come down the pipeline with Ethereum, including further scaling the network and enabling stakers – people who lock up ETH to help process transactions – to withdraw their stake along with whatever rewards it has generated. In addition, Beiko is excited to address the Execution Layer and Consensus Layer governance processes harmonizing, though that isn’t as “sexy.”  Beiko said he sees the Merge as an opportunity to bring the Ethereum community together and bring outsiders in. Now that Ethereum’s energy consumption will be reduced by 99.9%, according to estimates from EF, the Merge can genuinely onboard “people who are interested in Ethereum but were skeptical of the environmental impacts.” Overall, having these people be more receptive to Ethereum is “super positive,” Beiko believes.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  Justin Drake  Drake has been a researcher at EF since December 2017, where his research focuses on sharding, a scaling technique which breaks up vast amounts of blockchain data into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Drake told CoinDesk the community rallying around Ethereum ahead of the Merge has made the protocol a much stronger candidate for inherent value in the digital asset space.  “I've trained myself to just expect it [the Merge] to happen in the future, but now it's actually happening in the present.”  What he did: Drake made major research contributions to the architecture of the Beacon Chain – Ethereum’s proof-of-stake network. The design for the network went through several different iterations over the course of Drake’s involvement. Each iteration, says Drake, was “10 times better” than the last.  What’s next: Drake believes the next big thing for Ethereum will be proto-danksharding. This scaling proposal will allow more data to be processed at once and will, it is hoped, alleviate spikes in gas prices, a common problem for the network.  Drake also believes that after the Merge, ether (ETH), will become more of a high-quality financial asset, even calling it “money for the internet.”  Ben Edgington  Edgington is the lead product owner at Teku, an Ethereum client built by ConsenSys, an Ethereum research and development firm. (A client is a software that is used by computers operating the network.)  His journey to blockchain has been vastly different from his peers’ as he has a background in academia and climate science, and later joined a Japanese conglomerate where he worked on supercomputers. Over time, Edgington’s role shifted to project management, until one day he delved into blockchain and became hooked on Ethereum.  What he did: Edgington built out the Teku product team. There he worked closely with the Besu team, building its Ethereum’s execution client. Because Teku and Besu fall under the same organization, ConsenSys, the coordination of working together leading up to the Merge has been slightly easier, he said.  What’s next: Edgington is particularly proud of the work he has done to shift Ethereum to a proof-of-stake model with its implications for network security and environmental responsibility. He believes that the sustainability of PoS will draw more users to Ethereum, bringing in people who were skeptical to use blockchain because of its environmental impacts, and thus allowing for new opportunities and use cases to grow on Ethereum.  “I've had a role to play in removing a mega-ton of carbon from the atmosphere every week.”  Parithosh Jayanthi  Jayanthi has been a DevOps engineer at EF since December 2020. He told CoinDesk that he joined the organization when he was scrolling through Twitter one evening and noticed that Justin Drake had announced a new team at EF that would work on the Consensus Layer (CL).  What he did: Many have said that Jayanthi pioneered the testing of the Beacon Chain. “I started learning how to do this [running testnets] with the Altair testnets and the same tooling was reused for the Merge test networks.”  Throughout the time leading up to the Merge, Jayanthi’s main responsibilities revolved around shadow forks as he helped coordinate these crucial tests and debug any issues that arose.  “I'm looking forward to the next phase of Ethereum’s evolution.”  What’s next: After the Merge, Jayanthi looks forward to “a nice long vacation, closely followed by Devcon,” the annual Ethereum developer conference. Nevertheless, Jayanthi told CoinDesk that Ethereum’s next upgrades are already on their way, so we can expect EF to move full steam ahead with the next stage of Ethereum. Jayanthi is particularly focused on the Shanghai upgrade, which will address Beacon Chain staked ETH withdrawals.

He joined the Prysm team when EF was offering grants to work on Ethereum’s scalability issues.  What he did: Through social media outreach, Jordan was able to assemble a team of developers that came to be known as Prysmatic Labs. Together, they have been working on Ethereum PoS and sharding.  Jordan said he felt the tremendous weight of the Merge on his shoulders, given that Prysm is the most popular node software that powers the Ethereum chain. “If something goes wrong in our software, it could have serious repercussions on the network as a whole.”  What’s next: Like many others, Jordan is looking forward to the growth in layer 2 systems that are being built on top of the Ethereum ecosystem.  “We believe Ethereum will dominate the world of blockchain, and seeing it all materialize is something I truly want to witness.""  Read more: What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?  Alex Stokes  Stokes has been a researcher at EF since June 2018. He first worked on open-source contributions when he joined EF, but his current role is to look at testing, implementing and analyzing concerns for future protocol improvements.  What he did: Stokes helped with early sharding designs during this phase of Ethereum development. He also has led discussions about the potential for MEV-boost failure and helped to look into possible solutions.  What’s next: After the Merge, Stokes told CoinDesk he will work on implementing Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895. This suggested upgrade to the protocol will allow users to withdraw staked ETH currently locked up in the Beacon Chain, and will be included in Shanghai, Ethereum’s next upgrade.  In addition, Stokes told CoinDesk he has been quite interested in exploring safe options to implement proposer-builder separation (PBS), a design frame that allows validators to garner more rewards through Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), within the protocol.  Read more: Are Block Builders the Key to Solving Ethereum’s MEV Centralization Woes?  Marius Van Der Wijden  Van Der Wijden has been a software developer at EF since April 2020. His journey into crypto began with writing mining software. While at university he noticed that Etherminer, the open-source Ethereum mining software, was somewhat outdated, so he updated it and made a few changes. From there, Van Der Wijden quickly became part of the open-source team of Etherminer.  Van Der Wijden was subsequently approached by the Geth client team to work with it and the Ethereum Foundation. He accepted the position and contributed part-time while finishing up his degree.  What he did: Leading up to the Merge, Van Der Wijden wrote guides for the Consensus Layer clients so they could use their software with Geth.  Van Der Wijden also worked closely with Parithosh Jayanthi, Mario Vega and Marek Moraczynski on shadow forks for the Merge, in order to make sure that all clients implemented the specs correctly. He also created tools that were used during shadow forks to create bad blocks that would identify issues in some clients.  What’s next: “Oh, lots of cool things,” said Van Der Wijden. He is most excited about the Verkle tree upgrade, which will scale the network by adding large amounts of data into a Verkle tree (an updated form of Merkle trees) and provide a short proof of that data that can be verified, and EIP 4844, which addresses danksharding.  Sajida Zouarhi  Zouarhi joined ConsenSys as a research engineer in 2017 and then became a product lead for Besu, an execution client of Ethereum, until June 2022. When she joined ConsenSys she had thought that Bitcoin was the best possible use case for blockchain technology but was intrigued by what could be done with Ethereum.  “Considering Ethereum’s network is currently carrying most of the Web3 industry and economy, this protocol evolution can look scary. On the other hand, the Merge is also full of opportunities.”  What she did: Zouarhi brought her background of blockchain engineering to her role in product management. Her main priorities included working with core developers and laying out what the priorities were for the Besu client team.  Read more: Ethereum Is Only as Strong as Its Weakest Link  What’s next: A major challenge that Zouarhi hopes to address is client diversity. If the majority of the chain is relying on a single client software, then the whole chain is at risk should that one client have an issue. Currently, the most popular execution layer client is Geth with 78.4%. Therefore, Zouarhi hopes that Besu not only performs well with Teku, the consensus client from ConsenSys, but also with other consensus clients.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MINING | TECHNOLOGY | RESEARCH,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/meet-8-ethereum-developers-who-helped-make-the-merge-possible,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f7873c56a3580977d0fdc0355bb7a6a330bb6675-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416241,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucIH9,1663243613,JPMorgan: China’s Metaverse-Related Economy Could Reach $4T,"The metaverse – an immersive digital world created by the combination of virtual reality, augmented reality and the internet – will have “profound implications” for China and will affect gaming, advertising and e-commerce, JPMorgan said in a research report last week.  The digital world will offer an improved user experience across various internet business models, and this could lead to increased user penetration and average revenue per user (ARPU), the report said. The bank’s bullish scenario suggests that the metaverse could triple China’s online-gaming market to $131 billion from $44 billion.  The metaverse “could digitalize everything in the long term,” the bank said. It estimates a $4 trillion total addressable market (TAM) for the metaverse in China from “converting offline consumption across physical goods and services.”  The digital world could “help internet companies tap into business services and potentially double the internet time spent,” analysts led by Daniel Chen wrote. They estimated a TAM of $27 billion in China for business services and software in the metaverse.  The bank says that the development of the metaverse will also have a notable impact on the entire technology, media and telecom (TMT) ecosystem.  Tencent, NetEase, Bilibili, Sea, Krafton and Bandai Namco are seen as key Chinese internet and entertainment stocks that could benefit from the metaverse, the note added.  Headwinds to the development of the metaverse include regulatory risk around data security, and the technological preparedness and affordability of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices, the network environment and AI, the note added.

The so-called merger, which seeks to lower Bitcoin energy usage by more than 99%, appears to be a success. The blockchain&apos;s network security and transaction validation have undergone substantial improvements due to the Ethereum Merge. The process through which cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum generate new coins is regularly criticized. Each blockchain had its network of miners using specialized computers on every continent, crushing mathematical equations to validate transactions before the blockchains were merged. Referred to as the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, it uses a lot of energy (electricity) and is one of the most well-known targets for criticism. Reduction In Global Electricity Consumption The Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism has successfully replaced the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus technique as the Ethereum Merge goes live, greatly enhancing the network&apos;s sustainability.

42416235,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucHmx,1663239682,Bernstein: Strong Institutional Adoption of Ether Expected Following the Merge,"The Ethereum Foundation’s successful completion of the Merge early Thursday is likely to lead to strong institutional adoption of the blockchain's token, ether (ETH), Bernstein said in a research report.  The blockchain will “emerge as a digital asset category leader, given its economic transition, scalability roadmap, and [the] vibrant digital economy being built on it,” Bernstein said. It also expects strong institutional adoption of ether, due to its leading market share, market capitalization, and liquidity.  Block number #15537394 was the first to be validated under the proof-of-stake (POS) system, and about 45 ETH were paid in tips, the report said. The validator participation rate was around 95% and the “chain reached finality” within minutes of the transition, Bernstein said.  The Merge is the first of five planned upgrades for the Ethereum blockchain, and involved the switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) to a more energy efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  Following the transition, graphics processing unit (GPU) mining networks are redundant and will likely be used on Ethereum forks, Ethereum Classic or the gaming industry, Bernstein said.  The successful Merge is the result of years of planning and is a major milestone in the Foundation’s roadmap for “developing Ethereum into the world’s largest decentralized super-computing network,” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Manas Agrawal wrote.  From an investment perspective, Ethereum’s token emissions will be reduced by around 90%, the network's energy use will be cut by about 99%, and holders of ETH can now earn a staking yield, the note said.  The new economic model following the Merge, combined with the token burn, may lead to “negative token emissions” during times of high demand. This sets a ceiling on total ether supply, and brings “digital scarcity,” the note added.

Do Kwon along with five others, all South Korean nationals, are residing in Singapore.

Ether (ETH) futures have almost caught up with the cryptocurrency's underlying spot price following the historic overhaul of the way Ethereum verifies transactions.  The annualized rolling discount in one-month ether futures listed on Deribit, the world's largest crypto options exchange, narrowed to 0.3% from 17.66% before the changeover, which went live at 6:43 UTC, according to data provided by Skew. Discounts in futures listed on Kraken, OKEx and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also narrowed sharply.  The three-month futures traded at par with the spot price or with a slight premium on major exchanges, including Binance.  ""The basis, or the difference between spot and the futures, was approximately trading at $20 and was a good indication of the potential value of ETHPOW,"" Deribit Chief Commercial Officer Luuk Strijers said, referring to a possible token that would be created if the blockchain forks as a result of the change. ""This negative basis (backwardation) has now been reduced to around 30 cents.""  Strijers said Deribit and other platforms have taken snapshot of Ethereum at the time of the Merge to credit ETH holders with potential Ethereum fork token ETHPOW on a 1:1 ratio. Snapshots or records of content of the blockchain are commonly used to determine recipients of the planned airdrop – or free distribution of forked tokens.  Market participants, therefore, no longer have to hold ETH or take the so-called market-neutral trade of buying ether and selling short-term futures to collect ETHPOW tokens while bypassing risks from ETH price volatility.  As such, the record discount resulting mainly from the market-neutral trade has pretty much evaporated.  Traders began selling futures against ETH holdings early last month after some miners contested the Merge and proposed forking, or splitting, the Ethereum chain into a proof-of-work (PoW) chain and a proof-of-stake (PoS) chain. A potential Ethereum split meant ETH holders would receive a newborn PoW chain's native token, ETHPOW, for free.  That pushed futures into a discount of so-called backwardation, in which the futures trade at a lower price than the spot market. Futures typically trade at a premium to spot, representing the time value of money.  A Twitter thread posted on Monday by @EthereumPoW said the PoW fork would happen 24 hours after the Merge, meaning the forked chain will likely go live on Friday.

The move is aimed at reducing the power needed to secure Ethereum by around 99.95%, easing the concerns of those worried about the environmental impacts of crypto (Ethereum currently emits as much carbon as Singapore and its total energy consumption is similar to the Netherlands). ETH (ETH-USD) issuance will also decrease (a.k.a. Triple Halving), while industry players will further decentralize the network by securing Ethereum at home, taking some control away from the institutions and sophisticated miners.Backdrop: Ethereum researchers and developers decided to ease the transition into two steps, with the Beacon Chain successfully executed in December 2020. The update formed a separate parallel PoS chain - that could be tested in production without having a direct impact on the existing PoW network. It also grew the amount of staked ETH (ETH-USD), so that it would be large enough to secure the network before the &apos;Merge.&apos; The second step happened early Thursday, as the consensus layer of the Beacon chain was merged with the Ethereum PoW chain, and from the look of it, the transition was a success.

The decision to ban ""depository services,"" which includes paying returns to depositors, was made to protect traders from the risks associated with crypto lenders, the release said.  Several crypto lenders including Celsius Network and Babel Finance, as well as exchanges offering lending services, froze withdrawals over the past few months following a downturn in the crypto market, with bitcoin and ether losing over 50% of their value since the turn of the year.  One of the troubled exchanges that halted withdrawals is Zipmex, which has entities in Singapore, Thailand, Australia and Indonesia.  The Thai SEC filed a police complaint against Zipmex last week after the exchange failed to provide transactional information before a deadline.

In the two-week run-up to the Merge, the price of the blockchain's native token was up 4%, but remains down 15.5% on the month, according to market data.  Meanwhile, the price of token ethereum classic (ETC) is down 2% to $36.34.  While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin was quoted on the Bankless podcast as saying ether was “not going to be priced in pretty much until after [the Merge] happens,” traders appeared to disagree.  “Many believe that the Merge might make Ethereum faster or cheaper. This is not the case. For end users or developers there should be no noticeable difference between Ethereum before and after the Merge,” Will Harborne, founder and CEO of the rhino.fi protocol, told CoinDesk.  According to EtherNodes, 88% of ether nodes were Merge-ready and synched in the moments leading up to the event. In total 12%, or 305, nodes appeared to be recalcitrant with the transition with the majority from the Geth network.  While the Merge didn’t have a material impact on the price of ether, on-chain data shows an inflow of $1.2 billion onto exchanges, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Steep exchange inflow is usually a sign of traders preparing to sell, however, there isn’t a consensus yet. It could be anything from investors hedging positions to preparing to collect airdropped tokens from the expected EthereumPoW fork.  “If this happened last year we’d be at $8,000 already,” March Zheng, a Shanghai-based partner at Bizantine Capital said to CoinDesk via WeChat. “But the fundamentals couldn’t be stronger.”  Read more: The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain",NEUTRAL,ETC,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETC | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/09/15/ether-flat-after-successful-ethereum-merge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/295d5f58adf511c81ea269633f67967dee7ee0c7-1466x1100.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42416231,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucHNn,1663224231,"The Ethereum Merge Is Done, Opening a New Era for the Second-Biggest Blockchain","The massive overhaul of Ethereum known as the Merge has finally happened, moving the digital machinery at the core of the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value to a vastly more energy-efficient system after years of development and delay.  It was no small feat swapping out one way of running a blockchain, known as proof-of-work, for another, called proof-of-stake. “The metaphor that I use is this idea of switching out an engine from a running car,” said Justin Drake, a researcher at the non-profit Ethereum Foundation who spoke to CoinDesk before the Merge happened.  CoinDesk Special Coverage: The Ethereum Merge  The payoff is potentially gigantic. Ethereum should now consume 99.9% or so less energy. It's like Finland has suddenly shut off its power grid, according to one estimate.  Ethereum’s developers say the upgrade will make the network – which houses a $60 billion ecosystem of cryptocurrency exchanges, lending companies, non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces and other apps – more secure and scalable, too.  Read more: Monitoring the Merge: What a Successful Ethereum Upgrade Will Look Like  When the Merge officially kicked in at 6:43 a.m. UTC, more than 41,000 people were tuned in on YouTube to an ""Ethereum Mainnet Merge Viewing Party."" They watched with bated breath as key metrics trickled in suggesting that Ethereum's core systems had remained intact. After about 15 long minutes the Merge officially finalized, meaning it could be declared a success. The price of ETH – whose current market value near $200 billion makes it the second-largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin (BTC) – was largely flat after the Merge.  The update, which ends the network’s reliance on the energy-intensive process of cryptocurrency mining, has been closely watched by crypto investors, enthusiasts and skeptics for the impact it is expected to have on the wider blockchain industry.  Mark Cuban, investor and billionaire owner of the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, told CoinDesk he would be “watching [the Merge] with interest like everyone else,” pointing out that it might make ETH, the network's native token, deflationary.  The idea was there from the start that Ethereum would eventually make the switch to proof-of-stake. But the transition was a complicated technical effort – an endeavor so risky that many doubted it would happen at all.  ""There’s a part of me which hasn’t completely realized that this is actually happening,” Drake said. “I’m somewhat in denial, you know, because I’ve trained myself to just expect it to happen in the future.”  The update’s complexity was compounded by the fact that it may have been one of the largest open-source software endeavors in history, requiring coordination across dozens of teams and scores of individual researchers, developers and volunteers.  Tim Beiko, an Ethereum Foundation developer who played a key role in coordinating the update, said to CoinDesk, “I think the Merge can genuinely get those people who were interested in Ethereum, but skeptical of the environmental impacts, to come and experiment with it.”  Goodbye, miners  In 2008, Bitcoin introduced the world to the idea of a decentralized ledger – a single, immutable record of transactions that computers around the world could view, alter and trust without the need for intermediaries.  Ethereum, introduced in 2015, expanded upon the core concepts of Bitcoin with smart contracts – or computer programs that effectively use the blockchain as a global supercomputer, recording data onto its network. That innovation was the essential ingredient behind decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs – the main catalysts of the most recent crypto boom.  The Merge retires Ethereum’s proof-of-work system, where crypto miners competed to write transactions to its ledger – and earn rewards for doing so – by solving cryptographic puzzles.  Most crypto mining today happens in “farms,” though they may be more aptly described as factories. Picture massive warehouses lined with rows of computers stacked on top of one another like shelves of books at a university library – each computer hot to the touch as it strains to pump out cryptocurrency.  This system, which was pioneered by Bitcoin, is what caused Ethereum to guzzle so much energy and is responsible for fueling the blockchain sector’s reputation as an environmental menace.  “My daughter and I spoke about NFTs a few months ago,” recalled Ben Edgington, a product leader at the Ethereum research and development firm ConsenSys. “At the dinner table I rather foolishly mentioned some NFT projects, and she was yelling at me, ‘How can you boil the oceans with this nonsense? This is terrible. I can't believe that you do this for a living.’”  Edgington, who began his career researching climate science before eventually landing in crypto, understood where his daughter was coming from. “Rightly or wrongly, she'd absorbed a very toxic environmental narrative,” he said. “I mean, it's kind of hard to defend ‘stickers for grownups’ that emit, by some estimates, a megaton of [carbon dioxide] a week.”  Hello, stakers  Ethereum’s new system, proof-of-stake, does away with mining entirely.  Miners are replaced by validators – people who “stake” at least 32 ETH by sending them to an address on the Ethereum network where they cannot be bought or sold.  These staked ETH tokens act like lottery tickets: The more ETH a validator stakes, the more likely one of its tickets will be drawn, granting it the ability to write a “block” of transactions to Ethereum's digital ledger.  Ethereum introduced a proof-of-stake network in 2020 called the Beacon Chain, but until the Merge it was just a staging area for validators to get set up for the switch. Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake involved merging the Beacon Chain with Ethereum’s main network.  According to Beiko, the energy consumption of proof-of-stake is “not even a rounding error in terms of environmental impact.”  “Proof-of-stake is like running an app on your MacBook,” he said. “It's like running Slack. It's like running Google Chrome or running Netflix. Obviously, your MacBook plugs into the wall and uses electricity to run. But no one thinks about the environmental impact of running Slack, right?”  Edgington pointed to the environmental impact of the Merge upgrade as the benefit he is personally the most excited about. “I feel very proud, you know, that I'll be able to look back and say I've had a role to play in removing a megaton of carbon from the atmosphere every week. That's something that meaningfully affects my family and others,” he said.  New incentives  Rather than a single piece of open-source software, the Ethereum network is better understood as a nation-state – a kind of living organism that comes together when a bunch of computers talk to one another in the same language, all following an identical set of rules.  Ethereum’s new system introduces a new set of incentives for the people operating these computers to follow the rules as written, thereby securing the ledger from any unwanted tampering.  “Proof-of-work is a mechanism by which you take physical resources and you convert them into security for the network. If you want your network to be more secure, you need more of those physical resources,” Beiko explained. “On proof-of-stake, what we do is we use financial resources to convert to security.”  Although Ethereum had thousands of individual miners operating and securing its proof-of-work network, computers from just three mining pools dominated a majority of the network’s hashrate, a measure of the collective computing power of all miners.  If a few of Ethereum’s big mining firms colluded to amass a majority of the network’s hashrate, they would have been able to execute a so-called 51% attack, making it difficult or impossible for anyone else to update the ledger.  In proof-of-stake, the amount of ETH one stakes – not the amount of energy one expends – dictates control over the network. Proof-of-stake boosters say this makes attacks more expensive and self-defeating: attackers can have their staked ETH slashed, or reduced, as punishment for trying to harm the network.  Not everyone buys into the proof-of-stake hype. There are no signs that Bitcoin, for instance, will ever abandon proof-of-work – which proponents insist remains the more battle-tested and secure system.  And although control of the Ethereum network will no longer be concentrated in the hands of a few publicly traded mining syndicates, critics insist that old power players will just be replaced by new ones. Lido, a kind of community-run validator collective, controls over 30% of the stake on Ethereum’s proof-of-stake chain. Coinbase, Kraken and Binance – three of the largest crypto exchanges – own another 30% of the network’s stake.  Skepticism around proof-of-stake fueled Chandler Guo, a prominent crypto miner, to announce in the lead-up to the Merge that he would launch a fork of Ethereum’s old proof-of-work chain – a clone of Ethereum’s blockchain that hums along using the old miner-based mechanism.  Ethereum’s core developers have generally derided proof-of-work forks as sideshows and scams, but Guo’s “ETHPOW” effort and others like it have gained modest traction in certain corners of the crypto community.  Read more: Ethereum Proof-of-Work Forks: Gift or Grift?  Trading the Merge  In crypto markets, the Merge had become an object of speculation since at least mid-July, with traders initially viewing the event as a catalyst for a steep rally in the price of ETH. The market for ETH options started pricing in post-Merge gains, a welcome respite following the crash in digital-asset markets earlier in the year.  The prospect of a fork of the Ethereum blockchain by irate crypto miners spurred a wave of new activity, this time as traders tried to lock in value from the theoretical airdrop of a new “ETHPOW” token.  In general, it is impossible to predict with certainty how the markets will react to a successful Merge. The upgrade has been on Ethereum’s roadmap since its inception, so there’s the possibility that it has already, by-and-large, been priced in by the market.  “I think if you asked me maybe about three weeks ago, I would say that not only is it priced in, it’s overly priced in,” said Kevin Zhou of Galois Capital. “Now the market is roughly 70/30 in favor of this being a positive event for ETH.”  Read more: Ether Lags Bitcoin as Ethereum Merge Nears; Here’s Why  What’s next?  ""This is the first step in Ethereum's big journey towards being a very mature system, but there are still steps left to go,"" said Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's co-creator, as he reflected on the Merge during Thursday's viewing party. He went on to mention Ethereum's relatively high fees and slow speeds, which were not addressed by the update, but remain as much a barrier to growing the network's user base as environmental concerns ever was.  Buterin, Ethereum's most visible figurehead, previously outlined a set of next steps for the network that includes “sharding” – a method that should help address the network’s sluggish transaction times and high fees by spreading transactions across “shards,” like adding lanes to a highway.  Read more: Ethereum After the Merge: What Comes Next?  That upgrade was initially slated to accompany the transition to proof-of-stake, but it was deprioritized given the success that third-party solutions – called rollups – have had in solving some of the same issues.  Rollups foreshadow the likely future for Ethereum development, where community solutions – rather than updates to Ethereum’s core code – play the primary role in expanding the chain’s capabilities.  For Buterin, the Merge is just the beginning. ""To me, the Merge just symbolizes the difference between early stage Ethereum, and the Ethereum we've always wanted ... to become,"" he said on Thursday's live stream. ""So let's go build out all of the other parts of this ecosystem and turn Ethereum into what we want it to be.""  UPDATE (Sept. 15, 07:23 UTC): Adds information throughout.

42416232,c03DFnfLU3SbZvH4PucHXr,1663222092,Pre-Merge Ether Exchange Inflows of Over $1B Trigger Fears of Price Drop,"A huge amount of ether (ETH) is being moved to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges leading up to Ethereum's pivotal technological overhaul, the Merge.  The crypto community is worried about a price slide due to the influx of ether into exchanges.  Cryptocurrency lender Nexo deposited 450,000 ETH worth $720 million to digital assets exchange Binance late Wednesday, according to data tweeted by Nansen CEO Alex Svanevik. While crypto exchange Bitfinex received 288,442 ETH worth $490 million.  The cumulative inflow of $1.2 billion is supposedly the largest in six months. The total number of ETH held in centralized exchange wallets has jumped to a two-month high of 25.34 million.  An influx of coins into exchanges is usually taken to represent investor intention to sell, while outflows typically represent an intention to hold for the long term.  ""Highest exchange inflows in 6 months. Thanks, Svanevik, for alerting. Again be careful,"" one Twitter user said.  Trader and analyst Alex Kruger said very high inflows point lower. However, Hal Press, founder of North Rock Digital, tweeted that the two inflows are likely fork-related rather than a predetermined sell program.  Perhaps coins have been moved to exchanges to collect potential Ethereum fork token ETHPOW on an exchange, so those can be liquidated immediately instead of receiving the so-called airdrop in a hardware wallet.  Hochan Cheung, head of marketing at South Korea-based analytics firm CryptoQuant, said the coins have been moved to derivative exchanges, which indicates investors are trying to hedge their position in case of price volatility around the Merge, slated to happen in three hours from now.

42393784,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bpAzJB,1663206220,Craig Wright Tells Court He ‘Stomped on the Hard Drive’ Containing Satoshi Wallet Keys,"OSLO, Norway — Craig Wright told a Norwegian court on Wednesday that he “stomped on the hard drive” that contained the “key slices” required to grant him access to Satoshi Nakamoto’s private keys, making it “incredibly difficult” to cryptographically prove he is the creator of Bitcoin – a title he has claimed but failed to prove since 2016.  Wright’s inability to back up his claims with acceptable evidence is the issue at the center of his trial in Norway, one of two simultaneous legal battles between Wright and crypto Twitter personality Hodlonaut (real name Magnus Granath) over a series of tweets Hodlonaut – then a public school teacher with roughly 8,000 Twitter followers – wrote in March 2019, deeming Wright a pretender and calling him a “scammer” and a “fraud.”  Read more: Who Can Say Who Is Not Satoshi? Hodlonaut and Wright Go to Trial To Find Out  Wright previously attempted to prove he was Satoshi in 2016 by demonstrating “proof” that he controlled Satoshi’s private keys – first, in private “signing sessions” with Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen and former Bitcoin Foundation Director Jon Matonis (Andresen later said he’d been “bamboozled” by Wright and Matonis went on to work for a company owned by Wright), and later, in a public blog post offering “proof” that was thoroughly debunked by several well-known cryptography experts.  In Norway, however, Wright is no longer attempting to convince the court he is Satoshi with cryptographic evidence – partly because he claims to have intentionally destroyed his only proof shortly after attempting suicide in May 2016, following his signing session with Andresen, and partly because he now claims cryptographic proof is inconclusive and that “identity is not related to keys.”  Read more: How to Store Your Bitcoin  Destroying the hard drive, Wright told the court, was “the only way” to avoid being forced to prove his identity cryptographically – something he said he “refused” to do because it would give his critics “the easy way out.”  “I didn’t want to encourage the arguments that you need keys,” Wright said animatedly when asked by Hodlonaut’s lawyer, Ørjan Haukaas, whether he destroyed the hard drive on purpose. “Yes, you could say this is a risk, but I think it’s the most important thing I’ve done in my life.”  Instead of signing, Wright aims to leverage his academic achievements (which, like many of his other claims, are also widely debated), career history, mountain of patents and his relationships with “100 people” – including Andresen (“What proves [I am Satoshi] is my time talking to Gavin,” Wright said) – to confirm he is Satoshi “the traditional way.”  Wright told District Court Judge Helen Engebrigtsen that his ultimate motive was to get judges to “understand” that they could seize bitcoin from criminals via court order.  “The whole point I’m trying to make, and that I’m going to make, is that Bitcoin is not encrypted.""  “There’s a lot of misinformation from BTC maximalists that want to go back to drug markets, porn … I want it known that these lies, these slanderous accusations about how law enforcement can’t take bitcoin from criminals are wrong,"" Wright said, his voice raised and hands waving.  Read more: How Blocks Are Added to a Blockchain, Explained Simply  When Haukaas asked Wright if he believed that, if a judge declared him to be Satoshi, he could get a court order granting him access to Satoshi’s supposed trove of 1.1 million bitcoins that he “lost” along with the keys, Wright quibbled with the figure (“Satoshi never had 1.1 million bitcoins,” he said) but seemed to agree.  “They were stolen,” Wright said. “I’m taking action to have the thieves not benefit; thieves should not benefit from stolen property.”  Wright told the court a little thing like not having Satoshi’s keys wouldn’t stop him from accessing Satoshi’s coins, if a judge such as herself was amenable.  “Bitcoin is like a paper ledger. If you make a mistake in an accounting ledger, you can always update it … [A]ny alteration including having a court order that reassigns bitcoin can always be done, but it has to be a public thing such as a court order.”  (The logistics of how the Bitcoin blockchain works would make such a court order not only unenforceable, but extremely difficult to implement from a technological standpoint. The only other way to move the coins would be to use the private keys Wright claims to have destroyed.)  Read more: What Is Blockchain Technology?  Attempting to debunk the debunkers  In addition to his testimony about destroying his alleged access to Satoshi’s keys, Wright also spent a significant amount of time on the stand responding to his attorney Halvor Manshaus’ questions about the legitimacy of the “arguments from the internet” that featured heavily in Haukaas’ opening statements on Monday.  Particular attention was paid to an article by Jameson Lopp, published in Bitcoin Magazine in 2019, that debunks various pieces of evidence put forward by Wright to “prove” he is Satoshi.  Manshaus went over each of Lopp’s arguments showing inconsistencies between Wright’s story and the Satoshi history, and asked Wright to comment, chuckling softly as he read each one aloud.  Wright told the court that Lopp’s account was biased by his financial interests in Bitcoin.  “He founded a company that is funded and supported by people who need small blocks and the Lightning Network,” Wright said. “The entire value of his company will go away if Bitcoin scales.”  Overall, Wright said that Lopp’s points were “basically fluff that have no weight whatsoever.”  Wright handwaved away accusations that he’d forged documents or submitted false evidence, dismissing discrepancies as the results of opening files in different versions of various software, an errant employee managing his blogs and sneaking in sentences without his knowledge, hacking or – as in the case of the controversial “Jean-Paul Sartre blog post,” in which Wright attempted to publicly “prove” he was Satoshi – that he didn’t actually want to prove anything and so bungled it on purpose.  Read more: How Do Bitcoin Transactions Work?  “I have never changed any documents or manipulated any documents,” Wright said, when Manshaus asked him directly if the accusations had any truth. “No, I have never, ever in my life instructed a third party to manipulate or change documents.”  Wright denied he’d exaggerated his academic credentials (he claims to have at least “a couple” of PhDs): “If anything, I deflate my academic credentials. I’ve never told anyone how many I actually have.”  Responding to Lopp’s point that Wright had made earlier statements at odds with Satoshi’s quote that he was “better with code than with words,” Wright said: “I can write at a level that most people can’t understand, and I can code even better.”  Feeling misunderstood was a theme that emerged more than once during Wright’s testimony.  When talking about the overwhelming negative reaction to the Sartre blog post, Wright told the judge:  “I am too much of a smart ass for my own good. I have figured out after this that practically no one in information technology knows who Sartre is, let alone that he turned down a Nobel prize, let alone that he was an existentialist.”  ‘Toxic’ Crypto Twitter  Manshaus also asked Wright to tell the court about the emotional impact of Hodlonaut’s tweets and the #CraigWrightIsAFraud hashtag.  Wright said that, prior to March 2019, he had no idea who Hodlonaut was.  “I don’t remember the exact time, I was at work at the time, and it was pointed out to me,” Wright testified. “My mother and other people had responded over Whatsapp asking why don’t I do something about these nasty people.”  Wright said he tried to do something – he complained to Twitter, which he said yielded no results except the eventual deletion of his account.  “Jack Dorsey [Twitter's founder] is one of the funders of … Digital Currency Group, Jack Dorsey saw what was happening [on Twitter] ... and closed down my account,” Wright added. (DCG is the parent company of CoinDesk.) A DCG official did not immediately return a request for comment or confirmation of the claim that Dorsey funds it in any way.  However, Wright told the court that before his account was deleted, he received an influx of nasty DMs, some threatening physical violence to his family. He said he’d never received DMs of such an aggressive nature before Hodlonaut’s March 2019 tweets (though later, in cross-examination, he admitted he’d been sent similar DMs at least two years before, saying, “I try not to remember them.”)  Manshaus asked Wright whether the prevalence of the #Faketoshi hashtag, which predated Hodlonaut’s tweets, as well as other bigger names in the crypto space calling Wright a scammer and a fraud meant that Hodlonaut’s tweets were okay.  “No,” Wright said. “If lots of people get behind a false idea, that doesn’t make it right. Lots of people supported [Adolf] Hitler and enabled him. That doesn’t make it right.”  At the end of Wright’s testimony, he complimented the judge on the style of Norwegian legal proceedings.  “I quite like the court process here. It’s much better than people interrupting in American courts and all that stuff,” Wright said, smiling.  Hodlonaut takes the stand  Hodlonaut also testified on Wednesday, taking roughly three hours on the stand to tell the court about his life and career, his history in the Bitcoin community and his March 2019 tweets.  Speaking in Norwegian, Hodlonaut told the judge that, though he’d been interested in Bitcoin since 2013, he’d never cared much about the mystery of Satoshi’s identity.  “Personally, I’ve never worshiped Satoshi. I have an enormous respect for that person or persons that are behind the Satoshi Nakamoto name … It’s clear that Bitcoin was an attempt to separate banks from money … I greatly admired that,” Hodlonaut said. “I read articles by Satoshi. He came across as a humble, nice person that seemed to be very committed to his project.”  Hodlonaut told the judge that he first heard of Wright in 2015.  “It was at a conference that [cryptographer] Nick Szabo attended,” he said. “Craig Wright was on the stage all of a sudden with Nick Szabo … [N]o one knew who Craig Wright was or how he ended up on the panel. He started to argue with Nick Szabo about something called Turing Completeness … it was very strange, I thought, that this person I didn’t know was [challenging] Nick Szabo.""  And then, Hodlonaut recounted, came articles about Wright, claiming he’d been doxxed as Satoshi Nakamoto.  When the judge interrupted Hodlonaut to ask the meaning of “doxxed,” Hodlonaut replied:  “It’s the same thing that happened to me. It’s when a person wants to be anonymous and personal details are published on the internet.” He paused for a moment, sighed, and added, “Yeah.”  Hodlonaut said he woke up on April 11, 2019, to an explosion of messages.  “I realized that they’d put out a sort of reward with my picture on this website, a picture of my arms with some tattoos – I have tattoos on my arms – and people were encouraged to search for the person with the tattoos,” he said. “It was very stressful. People were walking around Oslo looking for me.”  Later, Hodlonaut said he received a phone call from a private detective who’d gotten his name and phone number from an employee at his office whom the investigator had duped into believing he was a police officer.  Some time after the suit was filed, Hodlonaut told the court that the private investigator messaged him on Twitter to express remorse over his role in the doxxing.  “He called Craig a …” The translator for non-Norwegian speaking trial attendees struggled for words. “A dwarf-midget that he doesn’t really like.”  “No,” interjected another translator. “A gremlin.”  ‘There was a consensus…’  In response to questions from his attorney, Hodlonaut told the judge that he had read the articles in Wired, Gizmodo, GQ and others “outing” Wright as Satoshi, as well as subsequent criticisms (from both media sources as well as social media posts) of the “proof” he offered.  Hodlonaut told the court he was basing his opinions on information from figures in the crypto community he trusted at the time, including Litecoin creator Charlie Lee and Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin, both of whom also called Wright a fraud.  “There was a consensus, and there still is a consensus,” Hodlonaut told the judge, “that Craig Wright is a fraud.”  When asked why he decided to post the tweets attacking Wright in March 2019, he said it was partly related to the renewed attention to Wright and his claims to be Satoshi after the hard fork of Bitcoin Cash (which resulted in the creation of Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision, Wright’s cryptocurrency) in late 2018.  “People were annoyed in crypto circles over Craig’s allegations. People felt that he was a fraud, and that he is a fraud, that’s why the word fraud was used,” Hodlonaut said. “There was a lot of annoyance, the vast majority [of people] were thinking ‘This is stupid … everyone knows what the truth is here.’ But that wasn’t the end of things.”  Hodlonaut told the judge he didn’t think his tweets would have much reach.  “The tweet I’m being sued for in the U.K … we can see [with a screenshot] that tweet, there were 12 people that liked it. One person retweeted it,” Hodlonaut said. “People were not very interested in this tweet.”  When he got the initial legal notice from Wright’s attorneys, Hodlonaut said he thought it was a joke at first.  “It was absolutely strange for me to think that I’d done anything that would lead to legal steps of the gravity that was outlined in that letter,” he said. “I wasn’t thinking ‘Yes! I have the opportunity to have my life turned upside down to be in a court case against someone who has a lot of money.’”  Haukaas asked if Hodlonaut ever considered Wright’s proposal for what the Australian described as an “amicable settlement,” which included deleting the tweets and issuing a statement (written by Wright’s lawyers) admitting that he believed Wright to be Satoshi.  “I can’t do that, I’m not willing to do that, because it is a lie,” Hodlonaut said. “I’m not willing to be in any way part of continuing something that I believe to be a fraud.”  More witnesses file in  Witness testimony is expected to continue through the end of the week.  Several witnesses, including Wright’s cousin, a former business associate, and an autism expert who diagnosed Wright with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are expected to testify on Wright’s behalf.  An expert from KPMG will appear on Friday to explain the findings of a report commissioned by Hodlonaut’s legal teams that is expected to show that Wright submitted falsified documents into evidence. He will have no other witnesses to support his case.",NEGATIVE,없음,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | REGULATION | FORKS,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/09/15/craig-wright-tells-court-he-stomped-on-the-hard-drive-containing-satoshi-wallet-keys,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/da629b743963b126fa8e4f883f632470b90696d7-1345x929.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Ether Rises as Merge Nears; Bitcoin Holds Above $20K  By James Rubin  A day after worrying inflation figures sent risk assets spiraling downward, bitcoin held fast above $20,000.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $20,100, roughly where it stood 24 hours earlier as investors continued to chew on the latest inflation figures and potential actions by the U.S. central bank at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting next week. The FOMC seems likely to boost interest rates 75 basis points for a third consecutive time, although the prospects of a 100 basis point hike rose to over 30% on Wednesday.  Ether outperformed bitcoin and was recently trading at over $1,600, a more than 2% gain in the final hours before the hotly anticipated Merge, the technological overhaul to a proof-of-stake protocol that promises to be faster and more energy efficient than its proof-of-work predecessor.  ""Given the jump in ETH/USD’s price last month, the Merge appears to have been priced in,"" James Trescothick, global market analyst for brokerage platform tixee, wrote in an email. ""This has been circulating for some time, so there is no element of surprise, so a strong rally is not likely.""  Most other cryptos in the CoinDesk top 25 by market cap spent much of Wednesday in the green with ETC and LINK up more than 8% and 3%, respectively. ETC was recently trading at about $38, an approximately 30% gain from late last month and about three times its price in mid July. The shift in Ethereum's consensus mechanism has motivated network participants to refocus on ETC, the native token of Ethereum Classic, which was created in 2016 when Ethereum's blockchain split into two separate chains.  Stocks  Equity markets revived somewhat from their Thursday thrashing with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq all trading up a few fractions of a percentage point, although a looming U.S. railway strike could lead to additional inflation pressures. Officials from the Biden Administration and union and railway company representatives were meeting to try to avoid the work shutdown.  Investors will be eyeing the release of U.S. retail sales data on Thursday for an additional signal of inflation's impact, likely Fed action and the direction of the economy. The report by the U.S. Census Bureau will come two days after the latest consumer price index (CPI) arrived at a disappointing 8.3%, higher than the consensus.  Trescothick of tixee wrote that data had clearly shown inflation to be ""the main threat to the U.S. economy ... that will drive the Federal Reserve to continue its aggressive attitude to bring CPI down to its target of 2% by hiking interest rates further.""  ""There is real concern that with higher interest rates, the U.S. economy will fall into recession, which is hurting risky assets,"" he wrote.  Crypto news  The fallout from the collapse of the $40 billion Terra ecosystem and its algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST), which was the first domino to fall in this year's crypto winter, continued with a South Korean court's issue of an arrest warrant for TerraForm Labs co-founder Do Kwon.  And a federal judge granted a motion for the U.S. Trustee's office to appoint an independent examiner to investigate embattled crypto lender Celsius Network’s financial management that led the firm to file for bankruptcy earlier this summer.  But crypto eyes remained laser-focused on the Merge and its potential upside. Joe Orsini, vice president of research at crypto investment manager Eaglebrook Advisors, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that while the public's technical understanding of the Merge was lacking, ""just seeing Ethereum in the news represented ""great strides.""  ""When you consider the adoption and how quickly it's become mainstream in the big picture of things – Bitcoin, 13 years old; Ethereum, about seven years old – these are great strides for these emerging assets that ultimately have a long, long and attractive opportunity set ahead of them,"" Orsini said.

It's Thursday.”  Thursday (UTC) is expected to mark the genesis of the Merge, a much-awaited upgrade to the Ethereum network that moves the protocol from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) design.  Developers say the move away from a proof-of-work system will make the network much cheaper and faster, and more environmentally friendly. However, the change will also mean the end of an income stream for Ethereum miners, who are rewarded with ether tokens for supplying resources to the blockchain.  “The Merge to proof-of-stake dramatically reduces Ethereum’s power consumption by 99.9%,” said Junnu Salovaara, head of crypto finance company Likvidi, adding the network would now sit alongside arguably sustainable projects such as Tezos, Solana and Algorand.  Mistaken notions  But misconceptions abound, coders behind some of the most popular Ethereum-based products told CoinDesk. Despite its benefits, the Merge is not going to make the network much cheaper or immediately scalable, developers point out.  “The biggest misconception on the Merge is that it will lower gas fees,” said Steven Walbroehl, chief technical officer of crypto security firm Halborn. “This is not true. It is a change of consensus mechanism, not an expansion of network capacity that would result in lower gas fees.”  Walbroehl and others also say that the Merge is unlikely to have a big impact on layer 2, or companion, blockchains, despite what loyalist sentiment on Crypto Twitter believes.  “I don’t think the Merge will have an impact on layer 2 projects,” he said, adding that while such blockchains “exist to make up for limitations” on the core Ethereum network, layer 2 systems like Arbitrum and Optimism provide speed and savings in gas cost and will “still be used.”  The Merge is also unlikely to improve Ethereum’s scalability significantly, James Key, CEO of Autonomy Network told CoinDesk. “It's a common misconception that The Merge will bring more scalability to Ethereum, because while it introduces proof-of-stake, which makes the network more efficient and environmentally friendly, it won't make transactions cheaper, he said.  Key said scalability, however, comes later as “sharding” is introduced on the Ethereum network. Sharding is a proposed method of splitting the infrastructure of Ethereum into smaller pieces with the goal of scaling the platform so it can support many more users than it currently does.  But even then, fees are likely to reduce to the level of those on layer 2 systems, which means users are likely to end up using those solutions instead of Ethereum. “Many [decentralized finance] applications will want to be on the same shard. And since fees will still be cheaper on layer 2s, it would give an even greater incentive to use those solutions compared to today.”  Energy savings  Despite the shortcomings, some observers highlight that the Merge is likely to change public perception of blockchains being “wasteful.”  “Ethereum and Bitcoin, the two oldest and largest blockchain projects, are both still using PoW, which is widely (and rightly) considered wasteful,” Mihailo Bjelic, co-founder of Polygon, told CoinDesk in an email. “Lately that has started to significantly impact the public opinion about Ethereum as a development platform and some startups, and enterprises became hesitant to explore Web3.”  “With The Merge, Ethereum is moving to PoS (proof-of-stake), which will exponentially reduce its carbon footprint,” added Bjelic. He claimed that startups and enterprises are “already regaining confidence” and embracing blockchain-based solutions for their usage.

The prices of most altcoins fell on their respective charts after the CPI showed a 0.1% increase in August, which has now taken the unadjusted value to 8.3%. The annual increase was expected to be 8.1%. Over the last 24 hours, Bitcoin registered a 4% loss. Given that the market is undergoing an extended sell-off, a further fall in BTC&apos;s value could be expected.

Bitcoin price has been struggling at $18,900 for the past month, but it has managed to break through this price level in the last week. Bitcoin has soared past the $22,000 level. The recent blow from the CPI report has pushed the coin downwards. Indicators have chosen to side with the bears given how sellers are dominating the market at press time.
