42426875,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxKBh,1463090697,Capgemini to Develop Blockchain Loyalty Tech Amid ‘Aggressive’ Hiring,"Technology consulting firm Capgemini took its latest step on its bid to dramatically increase its investment in blockchain tech this week, announcing a partnership with industry startup Ascribe that would find it using the startup's solutions to create a real-time rewards system.  The project comes amid a larger push by the Paris-based company that has seen it go public with its desire to hire 100 blockchain professionals for its financial services department by the year’s end. The move positions Capgemini as among the more aggressive global consulting firms in seeking a market share in blockchain, following announcements by Accenture, PwC and KPMG, among others.  In interview, Mahendra Nambiar, global insurance head of solutions at Capgemini, said that the statements, while admittedly grandiose, are meant to signify that the firm is taking what he considers the ""right actions"" to satisfy what he believes will be significant market demand for the emerging technology.  Nambiar told CoinDesk:  ""Technologies like blockchain have a very fundamental potential to change every part of the value chain. It’s not thinking about it as a widget, it’s like the Internet. This is a good commitment, but at the same time, it’s a commitment to the technology and that things are going to change.""  Nilesh Vaidya, senior vice president at Capgemini, agreed, noting that the company believes blockchain could be disruptive to a ""number of areas"" in which its clients have interests. At the company, divisions focused on retail, insurance and banking are already investigating how the tech could solve client needs.  ""We want to be there to shape the agenda. What they’re looking for in this space are people who understand the business domain and can apply that,"" he added.  Loyalty  As part of today’s announcement, Capgemini revealed that it will be working with Ascribe on prototypes using its recently released BigchainDB platform. Together, the partners will specifically move to create a new rewards and loyalty system based on the technology.  Sankar Krishnan, vice president of financial services at Capgemini, said the effort is meant to capitalize on an area in the market where he believes efficiencies can be achieved today.  ""Across the banking and capital markets, we’re looking at syndicated loans and proxy voting. But, we realize that for this to take off, you can’t go into areas where it’s tough to get everyone involved. We thought, 'Why don’t we pick one area where it’s so simple?'"" he said in interview.  Krishnan said the effort attempts to prove that blockchain isn’t a technology just for the ""sophisticated"" but that it can solve simple issues for everyday consumers.  For example, he said that consumers today often require loyalty points from regional supermarkets, but when they move, these benefits don’t carry over to differing regional brands.  Going further, Krishnan said that Starbucks users are often unable to guarantee their cards will be used in other countries, and that having a blockchain-based rewards system tied to a mobile wallet could enable better brand loyalty.  Krishnan said that such a system could benefit banks, who might be able to gain from the foreign exchange trading that may need to support such transactions.  Banking and insurance  On the banking side, Vaidya said Capgemini has identified two areas where the blockchain could impact banking, one in the area of low-value loan transactions and the other in cross-border payments.  In this context, he said Capgemini has been engaged to examine how blockchains could be used to process and approve loans more quickly through blockchain-based smart contracts.  Still, Vaidya cited both use cases as areas where clients are ""moving on"" from blockchain experiments to see how they might be applied more broadly.  “Up until a few months ago, there was a lot of interest in education, but now we find that everyone caught up on what’s happening, the big players are more familiar with the nuances, so the discussion is shifting from tell us what’s happening to let’s get down to more detail,” he said.  As for the specific technologies being used to enable such experiments, Vaidya said the banking division has tried ""a number"" of public blockchains and consensus algorithms, mentioning Ethereum as a specific area of study.  Still, he said that Capgemini has not yet developed a thesis on blockchain technologies and their variations.  Vaidya went on to indicate this education process is still ongoing, and that it might still be some time before blockchain solutions go live, noting that what would likely happen is that initiatives are launched in “limited environments” or in “limited geographies”.  As for its efforts in the insurance industry, Nambiar indicated these were more early stage and driven by client interest.  More proof needed  As for how Capgemini will meet its quota for blockchain professionals at a time when they are in short supply, Nambiar said the firm is taking a variety of approaches.  These included ""aggressively hiring"" architects and experts, as well as training its existing team. Further, he said partnerships would likely play a role, a strategy that has been embraced by professional services firms including Deloitte and PwC.  ""We’ll start to develop partnerships with the firms out there that are currently hosting those ledgers. Those partnerships, from Ethereum to Ripple, will be a part of helping us understand how the technology works,” he asserted.  In regards to the goal of attracting 100 professionals, Nambiar indicated that he sees the April press release as more of a statement of purpose than a direct goal.  ""I feel pretty confident that we’re going to take the right actions to execute against it. It’s not a simple thing to do,"" he said, adding:  ""The proof is in the pudding.""

42426863,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJth,1463084364,The DAO: Or How A Leaderless Ethereum Project Raised $50 Million,"A distributed organization with no single leader that could theoretically exist so long as there’s an Internet connection was launched last month, and has since then left many observers and Ethereum community members feeling optimistic – if not a bit confused – about what exactly was created.  'The DAO', as it’s called, takes its name from the description for a new type of entity: a distributed autonomous organization. Intended to act as a vehicle for supporting Ethereum-related projects, The DAO has garnered over $50m worth of ethers (ETH) – the digital token of the Ethereum network – from investors.  But what does The DAO do exactly? Think of it as a hub that disperses ETH to other startups and projects. Backers of The DAO receive voting rights by means of a digital token, which can be used to help determine the future direction of the organization and which projects will actually get funded following a voting period.  Participants stand to receive possible dividends, including ether, in return for supporting the project.  Yet, there are outstanding questions about the exact origins of The DAO as it exists in the wild today. Interviews with those involved in the creation of the code underlying The DAO's smart contract paint a complex network of relationships.  Christoph Jentzsch, co-founder and CTO of Slock.it, which created the open-source DAO framework at the core of The DAO, told CoinDesk:  ""We actually don’t know who started it. Of course we can see the address on the blockchain but we don’t know who owns the address. The only way to speak with the DAO is to make a proposal and vote.""  What is the DAO?  It's likely best to think of The DAO — which is sometimes also referred to as The DAO Hub — as a tightly packed collection of smart contracts written on the Ethereum blockchain.  Taken collectively, the smart contracts amount to a series of by-laws and other founding documents that determine how its constituency — anyone around the world who has bought DAO tokens with ethers — votes on decisions, allocates resources and in theory, creates a wide-range of possible returns.  Unlike a traditional company that has a designated managerial structure, The DAO operates through collective voting, and is owned by everyone who's purchased a DAO token. On top of that structure is a group of so-called Curators that can be elected or removed by DAO token holders. The current list of Curators include a number of well-connected Ethereum contributors including inventor Vitalik Buterin.  The DAO’s objective is to support sharing economy projects delivered by ""contractors"" by allocating ETH raised during its creation phase. The project has currently raised $51.1m worth of ETH by selling tokens — or voting rights — in exchange for ETH or other returns.  At the time of publication, two companies are listed on the DAO site as potential contractors. Slock.it, which in addition to creating the DAO framework aims to produce connected devices using the Etherem network, and Mobotiq, a French organization that plans to build a network of shared electric vehicles.  The terms of the potential projects are not yet public.  While the code created by Slock.it and published to Github has been implemented in the past, The DAO is unique, according to Jentzsch, who was previously the lead tester at Ethereum.  ""There are a lot of DAOs that are deployed,"" said Jentzsch. ""But only one that’s taken off, which we said that is the one we will make a proposal to.""  Doing business with a DAO  Another aspect of how The DAO operates relates to how the organization connects with the traditional economy, particularly on the regulatory front.  A newly established company, DAO.Link, is intended to serve as a bridge between blockchain-based DAOs and the real world, where contractors need to pay taxes and adhere to regulatory requirements in their respective jurisdictions.  While companies working with the The DAO or any distributed autonomous organization might in the future prove perfectly comfortable doing business exclusively in digital currencies, any individual or business that wishes to send corporate invoices and purchase orders or pay taxes won’t likely be able to attribute those funds to ""the Ethereum blockchain"" any time soon.  Ultimately, DAO.Link provides a physical address through which outside companies can interact with DAOs, according to Stephen Tual, founder and chief operating officer of Slock.it.  Currently transitioning from being a German UG to a GMBH, Slock.it partnered with Neuchatel-based digital currency exchange Bity SA to co-found DAO.Link.  DAO.Link was incorporated as a SARL, the Swiss version of an LTD, also in Neuchatel, a region of Switzerland increasingly known for its digital currency-friendly policies.  Bity co-founder Alexis Roussel explained to CoinDesk:  ""The main legal questions which DAO.Link can answer is that in Switzerland you don’t need to specify the person in front of you that you want to make a contract with. You only need to show it’s valid that the person on the other side is capable of making a decision.""  Thanks to the voting methodology built into The DAO’s infrastructure, ""The DAO itself has the ability to make a decision,"" Roussel added. As a result, the address on an invoice from Slock.it — which is also a customer of DAO.Link — will be DAO.Link’s address.  At that point in the transaction, it’s up to the contractor to declare or not declare the earnings or other transactions as he or she sees fit.  ""It makes it a lot easier for a large company to cross the bridge, if you will, between the crazy world of blockchain that a lot of people don’t really understand yet and the brick and mortar world where they operate daily,"" Tual said.  As part of the formation of DAO.Link, which is co-owned by Slock.it and Bity, Slock.it CEO Simon Jentzch – brother of Christoph Jentzch – joined DAO.Link as its president. Roussel joined as a board member, and both Tual and Gian Bochsler of Bity serve as member advisors.  Slock.it and Bity each invested 10,000 Swiss Francs in DAO.Link, according to Roussel.  Though Bity itself is audited by Dutch accounting giant KPMG, which has recently been conducting its own blockchain research, Roussel says he is uncertain if they will also audit DAO.Link since his firm only owns half a stake.  Raising capital  But Bity’s involvement with The DAO goes beyond partnering with Slock.it. Bity is also offering a simple smart contract whereby visitors to its site can purchase DAO tokens with ETH via a proxy address. The ETH is sent to The DAO from Bity’s Ethereum address, with the third-party’s address in the data field.  ""You will see many transactions from The DAO account that come from us,"" said Roussel, who previously worked at for German utility firm RWE. ""But the address stuff in the data field will be different. If you want to see who owns the token you have to look in the data field.""  In addition to providing a proxy method to acquire tokens from The DAO, Bity, via the DAO.Link service, also hosts the main website for The DAO.  ""We’re paying for the server and the domain name,"" said Roussel. The domain itself however, is registered to a PO Box in Panama. In interview, both Tual and Jentzsch said they do not know the actual identity of the domain owner, other than the owner is ""a member of the community"".  During the creation phase of The DAO, some have raised questions about whether those involved with prospective seekers of funding were purchasing tokens – a move that could create a conflict of interest if they end up voting for their own proposal.  In interview with CoinDesk, Jentzsch said he doesn't own any tokens from The DAO. Roussel said he doesn't own any either, but that he intends to purchase some before the price goes up later this week. He added that some members his team have invested.  As for Tual, he said that as a company Slock.it only holds ""what's necessary"" to make a proposal, or 10^-16 tokens, far less than one US cent, but that employees are free to invest as they see fit.  Regulatory concerns  In a regulatory context, what is The DAO exactly?  From one angle, The DAO seems to resemble a venture capital firm and its token holders appear to be investors. And while returns could, in theory, include ETH, Jentzsch told CoinDesk that the tokens do not represent equity and, for legal reasons, they do not explicitly identify the organization as a venture capital firm or a traditional company.  ""It's an organization that is helping products by giving them ether and of course they want returns,"" said Jentzsch. ""It could be a return on ether, but it could be free services or many other business models.""  For the time being, Tual believes that, in the same way that Ethereum was able to pre-sell tokens in Switzerland’s Zug Canton, the network of companies utilizing DAO.Link will be able to do business from the Neuchatel Canton.  But he acknowledged in interview that regulators ""don’t understand [The DAO], and I don’t think they will understand it for a while.""  Tual went on to say:  ""Somebody asked me that the other day: do you think it’s more for small companies or big companies. Well, I would say it’s definitely for a startup because these are the guys with the balls to try something new.""  Those at Slock.it estimate that the decentralized ""sharing economy"" they envision will take 30 years or more to fully implement. Speaking to CoinDesk, Jentzsch said he's hopeful for the future of The DAO.  ""We have always said that we want to build the universal sharing network,"" he said. ""We hope that this DAO will become the core of the sharing network that will decentralize the sharing economy.""

42426870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxK5h,1463080634,Palantir Denies Ownership of 'Quantum' Bitcoin Mining Service,"Earlier this week, a press release for a Hong Kong-based company called CoinFac began circulating a plan to ""introduce the next generation quantum computing technology into cryptocurrency mining"".  The pitch  promised big processing speed increases thanks to the claimed technology advances, and visitors to the CoinFac website are quickly directed to a series of cloud mining contract options. Though the website shows that contracts costing 50 BTC and 100 BTC annually are “sold out”, the site is still selling contracts costing 1 BTC and 5 BTC, respectively.  But at least one claim in the press release appears to be false.  CoinFac stated that it was owned by Palantir Technologies, a secretive data analysis software company co-founded in 2004 by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that originally drew funding from a CIA-connected venture fund.  The release stated:  ""CoinFac Limited, a technology company established 2016 in Hong Kong is owned by Palantir Technologies Incorporation, a private American software and services company, specializing in data analysis and technological software research. Founded in 2004, Palantir's is currently the top 30 most valuable companies in Silicon Valley with a valuation of $15 Billion USD reported in 2015.""  Yet Palantir is denying involvement with the firm. In an email to CoinDesk, Palantir representative Matt Long said that CoinFac’s claim is inaccurate.  ""Palantir has no affiliation,"" Long told CoinDesk.  This relationship is further claimed on the CoinFac site’s ""About Us"" page, which even includes a picture of Thiel. The page also details the firm’s founder, a man listed as Michael Howzeris, who is said to have held positions at major tech firms like Google, Intel and Oracle.  Yet, attempts to confirm this information via public search only result in links to the CoinFac page.  The release also claims that the firm is ""in close talk [sic]"" with Google, Microsoft and NASA, the US agency devoted to space exploration.  In a statement, a representative for NASA also denied any involvement.  ""NASA has not been in any discussions whatsoever with any cryptocurrency companies regarding the possible integration of quantum computing into their existing products and platform,"" spokesperson Kimberly Williams told CoinDesk.  CoinFac did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42426854,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJfh,1463071997,Congressional Committee Hears Testimony on Blockchain in Health Care,"During an appearance on Capitol Hill earlier this week, a representative for a prominent US think tank suggested that blockchain applications could fuel next-generation health and insurance data systems.  American Enterprise Institute (AEI) resident fellow Scott Gottlieb spoke yesterday before the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Health. In his remarks, Gottlieb testified about ideas for bringing innovation and competition to US insurance markets, at one point discussing using technology to design more intuitive insurance risk pools.  Gottlieb suggested that a more technologically advanced risk pool would have the capacity to auto-regulate insurance subsidies in real time, indicating that, from AEI’s perspective, such a system could employ a blockchain.  He remarked:  ""The designations that follow individuals in such a hypothetical insurance pool, which would indicate the existence of their adjusted subsidies and thus their underlying medical condition, would need to be completely de-identified in advance of enrollment and impenetrable to disclosures. But there are other economic constructs that trade contractual information with units of value and that allow these exchanges to be made anonymously. Blockchain, for example, incorporates some of these features.""  The suggestion comes during a notable period in the years since the US government implemented the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, which aimed to expand health care access through an insurance mandate and an effective socialization of insurer losses.  Further, it comes as major healthcare organizations are beginning to investigate blockchain technology, with Philips recently partnering with industry startups Gem and Tierion as well as opening a research lab devoted to the tech.

42426858,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJlh,1463066968,Korea Exchange Talks Top-Down Approach to Blockchain Innovation,"Though major stock exchanges in London and New York have garnered the lion’s share of major media headlines, their peers internationally are moving at a similar pace to investigate the potential of blockchain tech.  The Korea Exchange (KRX), South Korea’s only securities exchange, for example, announced it was moving to develop an over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform using the technology in February, a decision that could open the company up to entirely new markets if eventually launched.  According to Changjin Lee, head of IT strategy planning at KRX, the project isn't simply a response to international competitors. Lee indicated that KRX has been studying the technology since early 2015, and that the decision to start working on implementations came from the highest levels of the organization.  Lee told CoinDesk:  ""Kyungsoo Choi, CEO of KRX, identified the importance and potentials of blockchain technology and ordered [the company] to find how to use that technology. After that, we decided to take action about the technology.”  Such a top-down approach to embracing innovation would appear to be uncommon, industry observers have asserted. Still, that's not to say that KRX isn't using similar tactics to peers such as Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange and around 10 firms globally.  Lee said, for instance, that KRX has convened a blockchain task force that encompasses individuals working across the organization. This includes representatives from clearing and settlement, general strategy, and Lee’s group, IT.  KRX, Lee said, is even in the early stages of reaching out to to relevant members of South Korea’s financial system, including the Korea Securities Depository, the country’s central securities depository (CSD) in a bid to expand its efforts.  Lee further revealed the exchange has set up an internal task force that meets periodically, but irregularly, providing members of the company with ""guidance and solutions"" centered on the emerging technology.  ""It is surveying technical trend of blockchain, use cases, considering how to apply blockchain into KRX information systems, and collaborating with other organizations,"" he said.  Electing OTC trading  KRX is also not alone in seeking to leverage the technology to move its operations into new markets. For example, BNP Paribas is seeking to determine how it might create a crowdfunding platform based on blockchain, a move that would extend its business lines.  Lee explained that using blockchain in the OTC markets would primarily enable KRX to offer investors ""more convenient and faster services"" by filling a gap in current market services.  This would be plugged by the KRX Private Market, a new effort that the company aims to build in collaboration with local blockchain startups.  ""KRX is aiming at providing services in the private market positioning in between K-OTC and K-OTCBB,"" Lee said, referring to South Korea’s platform for unlisted stocks and the computer system that provides price quotes for these assets.  Lee explained that the Korea Financial Investment Association, a regional self-regulatory organization, now operates both K-OTC and its bulletin board service (K-OTCBB), but that bids and offers are executed on the systems differently.  ""In K-OTC Market, orders are executed automatically by trading systems, but K-OTCBB only provides bulletin board service, where bids and offers are manually executed,"" he explained.  KRX has indicated it believes this will ease the ability of market participants to find partners while cutting costs. The decision comes after the exchange similarly moved into clearing OTC derivatives trades in 2014.  Collaborative approach  To integrate the technology more broadly into those capital markets, however, Lee said more collaboration will be needed among participants on R&D and proofs-of-concept, though he didn’t hint at what projects could emerge.  As for KRX’s thesis on the technology, Lee said that the exchange sees the potential for use cases to develop that leverage both shared, distributed ledgers, as well as new digital assets that could be created and managed with the technology.  Such a dual approach comes as many financial institutions are scrutinizing this question, as shared ledgers or messaging environments have generally proved more actionable for incumbents.  KRX, like many other existing financial institutions, he said, won’t be looking to interact with any public blockchains as part of services it launches – at least, yet.  ""Because of the public blockchain’s limitations in financial market such as securities, KRX is considering private or hybrid blockchain for adopting the technology,"" he continued.  Lee said KRX plans to reach out to other market stakeholders and local governments as it continues pursuing blockchain applications.  Lee concluded:  ""Collaboration among market participants is essential.""

42426859,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJjh,1463066781,Why Satoshi Nakamoto's Identity Matters,"Frank Schuil is a Dutch entrepreneur living in Sweden, and the CEO and co-founder of bitcoin exchange service Safello.  In this opinion piece, Schuil argues that the identity of bitcoin's creator could have a great impact not only on the technology, but potentially the future of the world's economy.  Lots has been said (and even more has been speculated) following Craig Wright's claim that he is bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  At the time of writing, the community seems to have embraced the idea this unveiling was an elaborate hoax, despite his early involvement and relevant background.  While some will continue the search for Satoshi Nakamoto, it is good to gain an understanding of why it matters who he, she or they might be.  Satoshi's role in development  After a period of active involvement in the development of the bitcoin protocol, Satoshi handed over the scepter to former Bitcoin Core maintainer Gavin Andresen at the end of 2010.  Gavin then handed the keys to the kingdom over to Wladimir van der Laan, who now serves in this position. Since then the development roadmap has been managed with two degrees of separation between the current team and its inventor.  Further, after Wright failed to provide conclusive proof he was Satoshi Nakamoto, Gavin’s judgement – he defended Craig – was put into question and his commit access was revoked. As a result, there now exists an even bigger gap between the inventor and the development of the protocol.  So why does this matter? Open-source software is exactly that – open source. Anyone can make a copy of the bitcoin blockchain and start their own version of it, like has been done by Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Unlimited.  However, the original version of the protocol, Bitcoin Core, and the developer group supporting it, has been dominating miner and node adoption since day one. As such, they practically have a monopoly on protocol changes.  While their work has predominantly benefitted bitcoin and it’s ecosystem, voices rose to oppose Bitcoin Core’s scaling strategy. The aforementioned competing protocols were the result of this heated debate.  Now this is where things get interesting. Satoshi could play a crucial role if he, she or they plans to make themselves known. None of the alternative protocol implementations have reached a threshold of adoption by the miners or nodes (they need both) for a so-called hard fork from Bitcoin Core to manifest.  Bitcoin Classic, the latest and arguably most successful attempt at this, supported by Satoshi’s successor Gavin Andresen, got really far, and is still in the running.  Now, imagine if Satoshi comes out of hiding in favor of supporting Bitcoin Classic? What would happen? It could very well be the push Bitcoin Classic needs to reach a tipping point and overtake Bitcoin Core.  The implication of such an action is not only the potential for a hard fork away from the Bitcoin Core protocol, but also a hard fork away from its developers as it impacts who has commit rights to the most popular version of the protocol.  In this case, Gavin could reclaim the scepter and it wouldn’t be hard to imagine that Satoshi, the person or the group, would take the lead over development of Bitcoin Classic. The team currently working on Bitcoin Core would effectively be replaced.  It’s the equivalent of firing a development team to replace it with another. And just like a company firing its team, some developers may join the new team, others may not. And the development of the protocol may improve or deteriorate, affecting bitcoin’s future.  As you can probably imagine, this underlying dynamic for becoming the lead protocol creates a toxic work environment for both sides of the coin – pun intended.  Satoshi’s 1 million bitcoins  As the very first miner on the bitcoin network, Satoshi accumulated and theoretically still has access to roughly 1.1m bitcoins (estimations vary).  That’s 7.1% of the current money supply and 5.24% of the money supply when all coins are finally mined by the year 2140. At the current market price of $453, Satoshi’s bitcoin stash is now worth $499.4m, and $1.34bn when bitcoin peaked at $1,216.73 in 2013.  This in itself is not a problem. Everyone can appreciate that the inventor of this new kind of money and its underlying blockchain technology deserves to be handsomely rewarded, even if it makes Satoshi a billionaire. So, why does it matter?  Today, the market presumably has priced in the 1.1m bitcoins as lost coins. Satoshi by some is considered deceased with no heir to the coins or having lost the keys – it happens to the best of us.  If Satoshi suddenly were to reveal itself by proving to have access to the dormant coins, it could shake up the market. Even worse, if Satoshi decided to offload the coins to other cryptocurrencies or fiat money, it could spark a selloff that crashes the price.  How likely is this to happen? Not very likely. Even if Satoshi has access to the coins, it's unfathomable that he/she/they would jeopardize either their wealth or invention. The market reaction, however, is harder to predict.  Coming back to Satoshi being a billionaire. If bitcoin ends up becoming the global reserve currency or reaches other milestones of adoption, the wealth of 1.1m bitcoins may exceed $1tn. Consequently, Satoshi could become the first trillionaire.  To some, this contradicts the wealth inequality that bitcoin set out to reverse. Others argue that the wealth distribution would still be better than is the case with the current financial system.  Either way, it begs the question of Satoshi’s motives. What personal beliefs does Satoshi have and how may those beliefs impact our society? Having such wealth in the future would give Satoshi a sphere of influence that stretches well beyond the technological innovation of cryptocurrency or blockchain.  And therefore it matters who Satoshi is…  For those interested in the views of Craig Wright – in case he turns around and proves he’s Satoshi – this interview gives a remarkable insight into his thinking and is definitely worth the watch.  Few people that I know of speak so passionately about bitcoin and its future use cases, let alone in 2014.

42426856,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJxJhh,1463061267,"Bitcoin Foundation Receives $65,000 from Mystery Mining Pool","Half of the proceeds from an apparently errant bitcoin transaction, in which 291 BTC (then $136,000) was sent as a fee, has been given away by the recipient mining pool.  The Bitcoin Foundation said today that it received 146 BTC ($65,000) from BitClub, which on 27th April received the fee as part of block 409,008 on the network. The transaction drew notable industry attention and media coverage, given that the average transaction fee at the time was 31 satoshis, or less than $0.01.  Following the incident, BitClub issued a public call for the individual behind the transaction to come forward. Should no users step forward to identify themselves, BitClub said, it would seek to donate the funds, with the Bitcoin Foundation being named as one of the possible recipients.  At press time, it remains unclear which additional entity or entities received the remaining 145 BTC. Further, analysis of the transaction suggests the actual bitcoins sent to the Foundation were not those received in the original fee transaction. Representatives for BitClub were unresponsive to attempts for additional clarity.  Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton said the funds will go toward the organization’s existing efforts, including funding education and public outreach as well as its DevCore conference series.  ""The Bitcoin Foundation funding will be used for existing projects as well as new initiatives that will foster community dialogue and encourage an efficient development process of bitcoin technology,"" the organization said.  Additionally, the donation will help fund a research grant on the study of bitcoin security issues, to be conducted by Nick Szabo, the cryptographer credited with coining the term “smart contracts” as well as the tech’s key underlying concepts.  The funding follows a tumultuous period for the foundation in which two board members resigned or were replaced, and as the organization was said to be running out of funding for operations.
