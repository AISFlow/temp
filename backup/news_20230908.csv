17340565,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550603,1694214037,MakerDAO Explores Tokenized T-Bills With $100 Million Allocation Plan,"Steakhouse, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)-focused financial advisory firm, in collaboration with Phoenix Labs, a research and development company, has put forth a proposal urging the MakerDAO community to consider allocating up to $100 million from its reserves for investment in tokenized US Treasury Bill (T-Bill) products. The proposal, currently in the discussion phase, aims to explore new avenues for financial innovation within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Unlocking Liquidity Efficiency for MakerDAO? MakerDAO, renowned as the issuer of the DAI decentralized stablecoin, has already made significant investments in US Treasuries through off-chain structures since 2022, amounting to over a billion dollars. Related Reading: Litecoin Breaks Another Record: HODLers On Network Now Exceed 5 Million By venturing into tokenized T-Bills, MakerDAO seeks to bolster its balance sheet by gaining exposure to low-risk, liquid traditional assets. This move aligns with their long-term strategy of strengthening the stability and sustainability of the protocol. Tokenized T-Bills offer several potential benefits to MakerDAO and its community. Firstly, they provide higher transparency than off-chain structures, simplifying the auditing process and reducing the need for internal resources. With tokenized T-Bills, daily attestations can be streamlined, providing real-time visibility on investment performance. Additionally, tokenized products enable simpler accounting procedures by leveraging daily price feeds, eliminating manual profit returns associated with off-chain investments. Furthermore, tokenized T-Bills offer the potential for increased automation. Asset-liability management, a manual and slow process for MakerDAO, can be automated through tokenized products. This automation would improve efficiency and reduce operational overhead, enabling MakerDAO to focus on other strategic initiatives. In terms of liquidity, tokenized T-Bills present advantages over traditional off-chain investments. Redeeming stablecoins through on-chain tokenized products can be faster than selling off-chain and converting them back into stablecoins. This can provide MakerDAO with greater flexibility and responsiveness to market dynamics. Maximizing Returns? Despite the potential benefits, the adoption of tokenized T-Bills introduces certain considerations. One such consideration is the exposure to higher counterparty risk. However, a competitive market is expected to favor the more secure options, mitigating this risk to a certain extent. Tokenized T-Bills also offer diverse liquidity and yield profiles, providing opportunities for MakerDAO to diversify its investment strategy. Products range from super liquid non-volatile options, which act more like lending protocols with collateralized T-Bills, to frictionless products that offer better rates but require longer subscription and redemption processes. According to the announcement, these options allow MakerDAO to leverage different trade-offs without reinventing the wheel and cater to varying needs within the DeFi ecosystem. Steakhouse, Phoenix Labs, and BlockAnalitica will contribute their expertise in legal, financial, technical, and risk assessment domains to move forward with the proposal. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Research Firm Predicts Inflows Over 70,000 BTC, This Price Target Overall, the proposed allocation of up to $100 million for developing and experimenting with tokenized T-Bill products reflects MakerDAO’s commitment to continuous innovation and exploring new possibilities within the DeFi landscape. As the discussions progress, the community’s collective wisdom and insights will shape the future roadmap of MakerDAO’s investment strategy and contribute to the evolution of decentralized finance. As of the time of writing, the native token of MakerDAO, MKR, is currently trading at $1,113, reflecting a decrease of 0.7% over the past 24 hours. However, over the past seven and fourteen days, the token has demonstrated substantial performance, surpassing most cryptocurrency markets with gains of 2.5% and over 12%, respectively.

42392606,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8vVn,1694209560,SEC Counters Ripple in Effort to Appeal Groundbreaking XRP Ruling,"Whether or not Ripple violated securities law in making XRP available to retail investors by putting it on crypto exchanges is absolutely a question that needs appeals court intervention, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argued Friday.  The SEC filed a response to a Ripple memo which argued the opposite as part of its ongoing case against the crypto company closely affiliated with the XRP cryptocurrency. While Ripple argued last week that the SEC hadn't made a sufficient argument to warrant an appeal, Friday's filing pushed back forcefully.  ""The Defendants themselves say that the issues have industry-wide significance and are of special consequence,"" the filing said.  The SEC signaled its intent to appeal Judge Analisa Torres' ruling in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York last month, asking the judge for permission soon after. The judge allowed the SEC to make its case, giving Ripple a September 1 deadline to present its opposition. Friday's filing is a response to Ripple’s opposition memo.  Judge Torres ruled in July that Ripple violated federal securities law in how it sold XRP to institutional investors, but that it had not done so with retail investors. Another judge in the same court, Judge Jed Rakoff, disagreed with the judgment when he ruled on a different case, also brought by the SEC. The regulator pointed to this in its first memo and Friday's filing as part of its bid to convince Torres to allow the so-called interlocutory appeal, allowing an appellate court to take up some legal questions while the case is still progressing in the original court.  ""'[Judge Rakoff] did reject this Court’s legal conclusion that the existence of 'blind' trading platform-based transactions precludes the application of Howey, as a matter of law, under virtually identical facts (sales of the crypto asset by the issuer to investors on a platform in blind bid/ask transactions),"" the filing said.  Should Judge Torres grant the SEC's motion, it will need to present its case before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  Getting the legal disputes settled by the appellate court now could speed up the resolution of the case in the long term, the SEC contended.

Material Indicators, a prominent crypto analysis firm, sheds light on the prevailing market conditions and highlights the intricacies of short-term price action (PA) against the backdrop of the macro sentiment. Unpredictable Market Conditions Prevail As BTC Seeks Direction Despite a bearish macro sentiment, where a broader downtrend is anticipated, short-term price action often deviates from the macro trend. This phenomenon explains the occasional short-term pumps and rallies observed even within a prevailing downtrend. Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised for a 150% Surge? Key Price Levels to Watch Material Indicators emphasizes the importance of understanding these dynamics and the potential implications they hold for Bitcoin. Yesterday’s performance of the leading cryptocurrency may have come to a close, but Material Indicators point to indications that another rally could be on the horizon. The firm highlights the Trend Precognition A1- indicator developed and used to spot micro, and macro trends by the firm- continues to exhibit a slight uptick in bullish momentum across the daily (D), weekly (W), and monthly (M) charts, as seen above. This trend suggests the possibility of a resurgence in Bitcoin’s value, albeit with the need for caution and further analysis. As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is currently trading at $25,800, continuing its prolonged period of sideways price movement since the start of the month. However, it is worth noting that Bitcoin has been unable to regain the critical $26,000 level, which holds significant importance for the cryptocurrency. Reclaiming this level is crucial in order to invalidate any potential bearish pressure and mitigate the possibility of Bitcoin experiencing a further decline in its price. Surge In New Bitcoin Addresses Signals Growing Interest Amidst ongoing uncertainty and sideways price action, an intriguing trend has emerged that sheds light on the expanding interest in Bitcoin. Notably, approximately 527,000 fresh Bitcoin addresses are being created on a daily basis, reaching a new yearly high. Renowned crypto analyst Ali Martinez delves into the significance of this surge and its implications for the cryptocurrency market. The surge in new Bitcoin addresses suggests a growing curiosity and engagement with the digital currency, even during a period when its price has witnessed occasional drops. This surge in address creation indicates that an increasing number of individuals are showing interest in Bitcoin, potentially attracted by its underlying technology, decentralized nature, and potential for financial independence. For long-term investors and advocates of Bitcoin, this surge in address creation serves as a positive sign, reflecting sustained interest and trust in the cryptocurrency’s network. It demonstrates that individuals are not deterred by short-term price volatility and are committed to participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem for the long haul. Related Reading: LINK Price Surge Ahead? Chainlink Sharks Bet Big On Accumulation By actively creating new Bitcoin addresses, individuals are essentially establishing a connection to the network and positioning themselves to engage in various Bitcoin-related activities, including sending and receiving funds, participating in decentralized applications (DApps), and exploring the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. Ali Martinez emphasizes that this upward trend in address creation is significant as it suggests an expanding user base and a potential influx of new participants into the Bitcoin market. As more individuals join the network, it strengthens the overall resilience and legitimacy of Bitcoin, further solidifying its position as a prominent player in the global financial landscape.

42392619,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8waT,1694206005,NFT Video Startup Glass Falls to Crypto Bear Market,"Glass, a venture-backed crypto startup that sought to monetize NFT videos, is falling prey to the bear market; its founders are walking away.  Co-founders Sam Sends and Varun Iyer posted on X (formerly Twitter) Friday that they will “end active development” of Glass Protocol after determining the demand for digital, tradeable video NFTs was too low to continue.  “The market for video NFTs can no longer sustain Glass’ development,” Iyer said. Sends struck a similar tone: ""Unfortunately, we have come to the conclusion that there is not sustainable demand for video NFTs.”  The two-and-a-half-year-old startup is the latest victim to a sustained downturn in crypto trading that has struck the NFT space particularly hard. Trading volumes are down bad for all forms of on-chain collectibles, be they the well-known “blue chip” Bored Apes but especially for smaller projects like Glass, which never really caught fire.  The idea of Glass was to give online content creators a platform for minting and selling their videos directly to their fans, where they might make more money than, say, on YouTube. Its founders saw the blockchain as bringing more transparency to this process, and also permanence, by storing them in a decentralized manner.  “We really want to find a way to help everyone profit,” Sends said in a November 2021 podcast hosted by Arweave, the protocol’s decentralized file storage system of choice. “It’s a new way to express and own and share what you care about.”  Indeed, the NFTs created through Glass will continue to exist alongside the website and protocol, the founders said. But they won’t continue working on the protocol, all but dooming its future growth.  Glass raised $5 million last September from investors including TCG Crypto and 1kx. It’s unclear if the protocol ran out of runway or has any of its venture capital remaining. Sends and Iyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  In recent months, the founders pivoted Glass from the Solana blockchain to Ethereum, the protocol’s original home.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | AR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/09/08/nft-video-startup-glass-falls-to-crypto-bear-market,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/70b630f04c36fbb74d0e61fb078cc523d96c6f2b-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised for a 150% Surge?

It is worth noting that this appears to solidify its position as a frontrunner in the meme coin domain and emphasizes its growing importance in the broader crypto space. Ever wondered how meme coins compete on important metrics? 📊Dive into our latest infographic where we break down the performance of 6 popular meme coins, analyzing holder profits and whale concentration.#Dogecoin #Pepe #LEASH #SHIB #FLOKI #ELON pic.twitter.com/Di5vbyo3PZ — IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) September 8, 2023 The analysis, which took into account the top six meme coins including Dogecoin (DOGE), Pepe (PEPE), Doge Killer (LEASH), Dogelon Mars (ELON), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Floki (FLOKI), positioned PEPE and LEASH in second and third places, with 21% and 19% of their holders respectively turning a profit. Whale Concentrations And Other Tokens In addition to highlighting profitability, the study delved into the concentration of whales within these meme coins. Interestingly, 44% of Dogecoin tokens are held by whale accounts, while nearly half of the PEPE tokens (49%) are whale-owned. The report also shows that whale concentration for LEASH rests at 42%. Dogelon Mars and Shiba Inu, although popular names in the meme coin sphere, are fourth and fifth in terms of holder profitability, with 14% and 11%, respectively. Floki, on the other hand, sees 10% of its holders in profit with a 59% whale concentration, indicating the large players’ influence in the meme coin market. Notably, whale concentrations can significantly impact the price movements of cryptocurrencies, making large holders create substantial market swings just with their trading decisions.

42392624,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8wuz,1694198573,A New Crypto Scam Shows Perils of Elon Musk's Twitter,"A purported $25 million crypto giveaway on the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter is – no surprise, really – indeed too good to be true.  Posts on X on Thursday and Friday lean into one of the hot stories of the moment in crypto: the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which, as a result of a recent court victory, could be on its way toward being converted into a favorite traditional financial investment vehicle known as an ETF.  The core message: a claim that $25 million of a new token called GBTC – the ticker symbol associated with the real $13 billion trust – will be distributed to folks who visit a website mentioned in the post.  The catch: The account making these promises, @Grayscale_FND, has nothing to do with the real company called Grayscale, a fact confirmed by a Grayscale spokesperson on Friday; the offer is an obvious scam.  Before Elon Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X, a blue checkmark – like the one emblazoned on @Grayscale_FND’s account – was a sign the account was verified, that some measure of thought and vetting had occurred before the account got that label. Now, it means the account owner can afford $8 a month, giving rise to a proliferation of crypto scams wielding blue-checked X accounts.  The real @Grayscale X account has a gold checkmark, a designation reserved for companies and other ""official"" organizations. To avoid getting tricked, one thing an X user would need to know is that new distinction. But they could also be fooled by the fact that @Grayscale_FND uses the logo of the real Grayscale.  A CoinDesk journalist was made aware of @Grayscale_FND's posts because somebody spammed him with it on X. @Grayscale_FND doesn't accept direct messages from accounts it doesn't follow, so there is no way to reach whoever is behind it.  Grayscale is, like CoinDesk, owned by Digital Currency Group.  The reply to an email sent to X's address for the press: ""Busy now, please check back later.""

Litecoin Long-Term Holders Have Continued To Rise In Number Recently According to data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock, LTC has seen its long-term holder count hit a new record this week. The firm defines “long-term holders” (LTHs) or HODLers as investors holding onto their coins since at least one year ago. Note that this cutoff for the LTHs differs from what some other analytics platforms use, usually around five to six months. The chart below shows how the number of addresses owned by these LTH HODLers has changed over the past few years. The value of the metric seems to have been going up in recent days | Source: IntoTheBlock on X As displayed in the above graph, the Litecoin HODLer count has significantly increased during this period. Since the start of last year, in particular, the indicator has seen exponential growth. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Sell 1.02 Billion ADA, More Pain Ahead? Following this sharp rise, the number of addresses carrying coins since at least one year ago has now broken the five million mark, a new record for the cryptocurrency. Interestingly, while the LTHs have grown in number during this period, the cryptocurrency price has mostly struggled. This shows that despite the poor price action, there has been growing confidence among a subset of holders who believe that the asset would be a profitable investment in the long term. This is naturally a positive development for the cryptocurrency, as more LTHs mean more supply that’s locked inside the wallets of these resolute hands, which in turn implies a lesser possibility of selling occurring in the market. LTC Price Has Continued To Struggle Recently Since Litecoin finished its plunge in mid-August, its price has only moved sideways. When writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at around $63. Looks like the coin hasn't been moving much recently | Source: LTCUSD on TradingView While the Litecoin HODLers only going up in number through this slide since July is a constructive sign for the asset, it may not mean much in the short term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Decline Further Before A Rebound, Here’s Why Where the LTC price could go next from here depends on several factors, one of which could be on-chain resistance and support levels. IntoTheBlock has shared the concentration of the investors at the different LTC cost basis price ranges. Looks like the next range isn't that thick | Source: IntoTheBlock on X The “cost basis” here refers to the price at which the investors bought their coins. In the above data, the dot for the $64.9 to $69.29 range, for instance, represents the percentage of Litecoin investors who bought at prices lying inside this range. Generally, when the price surges to cost basis levels with a high amount of investor concentration, there is a chance that the asset could feel some resistance. This is because these investors, previously in losses, come into the green with the surge, which may entice them to sell and exit the market. The range ahead of the current one looks to be not that concentrated with holders, which may mean that Litecoin wouldn’t find too much resistance if a surge toward the $69 mark has to happen. However, there are notable percentages of holders in the following few price ranges, making a further surge difficult.

42392615,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8wFx,1694195626,Grayscale Ethereum Trust Discount Drops to Lowest in a Year Amid Spot Ether ETF Push,"The discount to net asset value (NAV) for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has narrowed to its slimmest in a year following this week’s regulatory filing for what would be the first spot ether exchange-traded fund (ETF).  As of the close of stock market trading Thursday afternoon, the discount had declined to 27% for the first time since last September, CryptoQuant data shows. The discount had ballooned to near 60% late last year alongside plunging crypto markets.  The narrowing of the ETHE discount began in earnest in mid-June after BlackRock filed for a spot bitcoin ETF, and continued further last week after Grayscale’s court victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its bid to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. The momentum continued this week after Cboe BZX filed to launch what would be the U.S.'s first spot ether ETFs with asset managers VanEck and Ark Invest.  “The market is weighing higher odds that Grayscale will be able to convert its ETHE product into an ETF following the push from traditional finance giants into the space,” Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock, noted in a report.  The action has sent ETHE shares higher by 140% this year, IntoTheBlock noted, significantly outperforming the underlying cryptocurrency’s 36% year-to-date gain.  Grayscale and CoinDesk are both owned by Digital Currency Group.  ETHE is a closed-end fund that manages $4.5 billion worth of ether. Its current structure doesn’t allow redemptions, so converting the trust into an ETF – a structure that does allow for share redemptions – would effectively close the discount to zero.

17327017,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550554,1694192419,"Bitcoin Spot ETFs: Research Firm Predicts Inflows Over 70,000 BTC, This Price Target","In a recent series of tweets, Vetle Lunde, Senior Analyst at K33 Research, delved deep into the potential ramifications of the US Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs. Lunde’s analysis suggests that the broader market might be significantly underestimating the transformative power of these financial instruments. Lunde’s assertion is rooted in five core reasons. He began with a bold proclamation: “The market is wrong – and dramatically underestimates the impact of US BTC ETFs (and ETH futures-based ETFs).” Why The Market Is Wrong On Bitcoin Firstly, Lunde believes that the current climate is ripe for the approval of US spot ETFs, suggesting that the odds have never been more favorable. As NewsBTC reported, Bloomberg experts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart recently raised their Bitcoin spot ETF approval odds following the Grayscale judgment to 75% this year, 95% by the end of 2024. Related Reading: Bitcoin Analysis: Why 2024 Will Be The Highest Returning Year This Cycle Secondly, Lunde pointed out that BTC price has retraced to pre-BlackRock announcement levels. The third reason revolves around the potential competition and the simultaneous launches of multiple US spot ETFs. Lunde anticipates that these, if approved, could lead to robust inflows, potentially surpassing the initial trading days of both BITO and Purpose. For context, he highlighted that Purpose saw inflows of 11,141 BTC, and in its wake, subsequent ETF launches in Canada resulted in a whopping 58,000 BTC worth of inflows within a mere four months. Given the vastness of the US market compared to Canada, the inflow potential is considerably higher. Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Before Halving Expected, Will It Get Worse In September? The fourth reason Lunde presented is based on historical data from the past four years. He emphasized a noticeable correlation between strong BTC investment vehicle inflows and appreciating BTC prices. This relationship becomes even more pronounced during periods of extreme inflows, which have historically contributed to significant market uplifts. The last crucial point for Lunde is that on August 17 the market got rid of from excess leverage, as NewsBTC reported. By The Numbers In conclusion, the research firm posits that US BTC spot ETFs could see at least 30,000 BTC worth of inflows in their first 10 days. Over a span of four months, the combined inflows into BTC investment vehicles could range between 70,000 to 100,000 BTC, driven by US spot ETFs and growing inflows to ETPs in other countries. Based on these flow assumptions and data from the past four years, Lunde suggests a potential 66% BTC rally, targeting a price of $42,000. However, he also cautioned that this projection is based on a “naïve assumption” and doesn’t account for other market-moving events. At press time, BTC traded at $25,865.

Related Reading: XRP Bottom Support Holds Strong: A Healthy Sign For The Crypto’s Price? As of the latest data, XLM is trading at $0.124 according to CoinGecko, reflecting a 2% rally over the past 24 hours and an impressive 10% surge in the last seven days. These gains are indicative of growing optimism among XLM investors. XLM Chart Indicators Favor Bulls The on-chain indicators are aligning with the bullish sentiment surrounding XLM. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around the neutral 50 mark, suggesting a healthy demand for XLM. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at +0.10, indicating an influx of capital into XLM. This influx is typically a bullish sign, pointing towards the growing confidence among investors in the cryptocurrency. Despite the resurging optimism, XLM faces a battleground in the long/short ratio on exchanges. The tight margins indicate that sellers are actively trying to thwart the bullish rally. While long positions are inching closer to the critical 50% flip point of the long/short ratio, sellers currently maintain the upper hand, exerting pressure on XLM’s upward trajectory. XLM market cap currently at $3.4 billion. Chart: TradingView.com What Lies Ahead For XLM? With the $0.11 support level proving to be a formidable stronghold for bulls and chart indicators hinting at further gains, XLM enthusiasts are eyeing a target range of $0.17 to $0.19, aiming to revisit the highs last seen in July. The crypto market remains dynamic and volatile, so investors should remain vigilant and stay tuned for developments that could impact XLM’s price trajectory. Related Reading: LINK Price Surge Ahead?

Financial terms for the acquisition were not disclosed. Ripple declined to disclose further details when contacted by CoinDesk, though a person with knowledge of the matter said the price tag was less than the $250 million it paid for custody firm Metaco in May.  The acquisition adds Nevada to Ripple's list of regulatory licenses, which includes a New York BitLicense and money transmitter licenses in 30 U.S. states.  Fortress Trust, which provides financial and regulatory structure for blockchain companies, was formed by Scott Purcell, who has a long history in the industry. He was CEO of crypto custodian Prime Trust until 2020. Years after he left Prime Trust, the company was ordered into receivership after fellow custodian BitGo terminated its proposed acquisition of the firm.  Monica Long, Ripple's president, described the acquisition as bolstering the firm's aim of ""becoming the one-stop shop for enterprises looking to convert, store and move value on blockchain.""  Ripple became a minority investor in Fortress Trust's parent company Fortress Blockchain Technologies in August 2022, as part of the Web3 infrastructure provider's seed round.

Cardano Whales Have Participated In Some Distribution Recently Cardano didn’t have the best time in August, as the cryptocurrency registered a more than 18% drop. This new month of September hasn’t been any better for ADA, as the asset has only continued to struggle sideways around its lows so far. At present, the asset is trading just under the $0.26 level. The chart below displays the recent price action in the cryptocurrency. Looks like ADA hasn't moved much since the start of the month | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView Cardano’s flat returns over the past week aren’t anything different from what has been happening in the wider sector, as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have also been similarly stale recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin MVRV At Critical Support Line, Will Retest Be Successful? That said, a bearish signal exclusive to the asset appears to have emerged, as Ali, an analyst on X, has pointed out in a new post. According to on-chain data, the ADA whales have participated in a selloff over the past week. The value of the metric seems to have been heading down in recent days | Source: @ali_charts on X The above chart shows the trend in the combined supply of the Cardano investors holding at least 10 million and at most 100 million ADA in their wallets. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to about $2.6 million at the lower end and $26 million at the upper bound. The holders of this vast amount of the token are called “whales.” Due to their massive holdings, they are among the most influential entities on the network. The graph shows that these large investors have seen their holdings go down sharply recently. This ADA holder group has distributed a net amount of 1.02 billion ADA (worth around $260 million) in this latest selloff, which is a pretty significant figure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Decline Further Before A Rebound, Here’s Why The whales shaving off their supply is naturally not a positive sign for the cryptocurrency, as it suggests that some of these humongous holders don’t think the asset will recover shortly, so they are cutting their losses and exiting the coin. ADA Continues To Be 7th Largest Coin In Sector Despite its decline, Cardano is still the seventh-largest asset in the cryptocurrency sector in terms of market cap, as the table below shows. The market cap of the asset is around $9 billion at the moment | Source: CoinMarketCap However, the gap between ADA and the 8th place Dogecoin (DOGE) is down to less than $100 million now, meaning that the asset is at risk of dropping down from its spot. Unless things change fast for Cardano, it may be inevitable that the cryptocurrency would slip below the memecoin shortly, given the bearish movement from the whales.

And even if it had completed its research, Barr said it wouldn’t make any move without “clear support from the executive branch and authorizing legislation from Congress.” Such a bill would have to clear a divided Congress, and the idea of a digital dollar has already drawn sharp criticism from Republican lawmakers.  Barr also underlined the need for Congress to come up with answers on stablecoins – the crypto sector’s tokens tied to steady assets such as the dollar.  “I remain deeply concerned about stablecoin issuance without strong federal oversight,” he said. “If non-federally regulated stablecoins were to become a widespread means of payment and store of value, they could pose significant risks to financial stability, monetary policy, and the U.S. payments system. It is important to get the legislative and regulatory framework right before significant risks emerge.”  Meanwhile, the Fed has also recently launched its FedNow real-time payments network. Some supporters of FedNow have suggested it could compete with the features offered by stablecoins. Barr said the program has so far had limited use.  “While current volumes on FedNow are small, I expect that participation will grow over time,” he said.

42392621,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8wkj,1694177025,"Bitcoin Halving Is Nice, but Kickstarting Bull Run Requires Fiat Money Supply Growth","The battered crypto market awaits the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain's fourth mining reward halving, due in April 2024, in hopes it would kickstart a major run higher, living up to its past reputation as a major bullish catalyst.  Traders, however, should note that previous halvings did not necessarily catalyze bull runs single-handedly. Macro likely also played a significant role, mainly in the form of abundant fiat liquidity conditions, according to data tracked by MacroMicro.  Bullish reward halvings?  Reward halving refers to already-programmed code that reduces bitcoin's pace of supply expansion by 50% every four years. The next halving will reduce the per-block reward paid to miners to 3.125 BTC from 6.25 BTC.  Previous halvings happened in November 2012, July 2016 and May 2020, with bitcoin chalking out triple-digit price rallies to new record highs in the subsequent 12-18 months before entering notable downtrends.  Those bear markets ran out of steam roughly 15 to 16 months before the next halving. Bitcoin's year-to-date gain of 56% in 2023, marking a recovery from the depth of the past year's bear market, is consistent with the timing of the previous price bottoms.  Don't ignore the M2 growth rate  The magnitude of the expected halving-led uptrend has been and will continue to be likely contingent on major central banks – U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and People's Bank of China – boosting their year-on-year M2 money supply growth rates.  The aggregate M2 of the four major central banks represents the total value of their respective fiat currency circulating in the market.  The previous post-halving bull runs were characterized by a 6% or higher aggregate M2 money supply growth of the Fed, ECB, BOJ and PBOC. Meanwhile, bear markets coincided with a deceleration in the money supply growth rate.  The pattern validates the popular argument that bitcoin is a pure play on fiat liquidity.  While the total M2 money supply growth rate has turned positive this year, it remains well below the 6% mark. The Fed and most other central banks have raised rates rapidly over the past 12-18 months to tame inflation, and the probability of renewed liquidity easing in months ahead appears low.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/08/kickstarting-bitcoin-bull-run-requires-fiat-money-supply-growth,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/677999a6aa0f0e300eeaed71fdeebfba21ed830d-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17316703,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550515,1694176828,Dogecoin Poised for a 150% Surge? Key Price Levels to Watch,"The price trajectory of Dogecoin has been significantly influenced by Elon Musk’s tweets about the meme coin in recent weeks and months. Notably, Dogecoin ascended past the $0.1589 mark in November 2022, following Musk’s acquisition of Twitter. Since then, however, DOGE has been on a pronounced downtrend. The anticipation of Musk introducing Dogecoin as a payment method on Twitter remains palpable within the DOGE community. However, outside this sentiment is not shared, underscored by the stark decline in DOGE trading volume, suggesting a diminished presence of speculators and traders. If Musk does integrate DOGE on Twitter, the price reaction is likely to be swift. But what is a good entry price? Monthly Chart DOGE/USD While many older altcoins are plumbing new lows, Dogecoin exhibits a more resilient sideways accumulation pattern on its monthly chart. This chart reveals that the $0.0480 mark is pivotal for Dogecoin. Should DOGE maintain its stance above this price, it could present a viable opportunity for long-term spot investors. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Analysis: Is It Clawing Its Way Out Of The ‘Crab Market’? This price level is especially interesting as it coincides with the 100-week EMA at $0.04886. However, it’s imperative to acknowledge the inherent unpredictability associated with Dogecoin’s long-term trajectory, given its meme coin status. Weekly Chart Dogecoin The 1-month chart delineates a clear downtrend. DOGE could fall towards the lower trendline at $0.0480 before another run towards the upper trendline at $0.075. Remarkably, the 30-month low of June 2022 is also located near the trend channel low at $0.0488. If DOGE bounces up from here, the price would have to face the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0909. A retest of the breakout from the downtrend could occur here. If the bulls succeed, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.1093 and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $0.1169 could come into focus. The final target is the November 2022 high at $0.1589 where huge selling pressure is to be expected. At current price, DOGE would need to gain over 150% to reach this level. Daily Chart DOGE/USD The 1-day chart underscores the persistent downtrend Dogecoin has been grappling with since December of the preceding year. This downtrend, demarcated by a descending trend channel, remains unbroken. Late in July, DOGE recoiled from the upper boundary of this channel, only to descend once more. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Slide Persists Despite This Elon Musk Biography Revelation Alarmingly, pivotal support levels, inclusive of the 200-day EMA, have been compromised, hinting at a potential bearish trajectory. Current chart configurations suggest that DOGE might revisit its annual nadir at $0.05593 shortly. In a more bearish projection, a decline to the lower confines of the descending channel, oscillating between $0.05 and $0.048, is plausible. Conversely, if DOGE steers clear of registering a new annual low, especially if the broader market sentiment experiences an upswing (perhaps due to the approval of a Bitcoin Spot ETF), the entry point for prospective investors might materialize sooner. For a substantial price resurgence, it’s imperative for DOGE to rebound from this potential new low with a robust buying volume, indicating renewed interest and liquidity for the meme coin.

42392620,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8wpr,1694174435,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Shows Signs of Life,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin showed some signs of stirring from its September stupor late on Thursday, rising around 3% to $26,400, before dropping back below $26,000 during the European morning. The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) also hit its highest point this month, rising over 2% before retreating. Bitcoin has mostly languished below $26,000 this month as traders awaited clarity around the big regulatory hotspots, such as the SEC’s decision on the listing of a spot bitcoin ETF in the U.S. September is a difficult month for bitcoin, which has posted negative returns every year since 2016. So far, 2023 looks so far to be no exception.  Coinbase set out plans for an international expansion that focuses on acquiring licenses in major financial jurisdictions ""enacting clear rules"" for the crypto industry. CEO Brian Armstrong has expressed concerns in the last few months about the lack of regulatory certainty in Coinbase’s native U.S., so it is targeting the EU, U.K., Canada, Brazil, Singapore and Australia as immediate priorities. The exchange added that it is ""in the final stages of selecting the location"" for its EU hub, saying it wishes to ""leverage our being the most trusted brand in the crypto space ahead of the European elections in June 2024.""  MicroStrategy’s large bitcoin impairment losses have given a false impression of the company’s inherent value, according to investment bank Berenberg, something changes to accounting standards should fix. MicroStrategy has reported $2.23 billion of cumulative impairment losses from its BTC holdings since August 2020, Berenberg said in a report on Wednesday. Proposed changes by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) will allow companies like MicroStrategy to “eliminate the poor optics that have been created by impairment losses,” the bank said. This week the FASB voted to let companies use fair-value accounting in a move that will allow them to show gains and losses immediately on their income statements.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows one-month bitcoin skew, which measures the spread between the volatility premiums for call and put options expiring in four weeks.  Skew fell to nearly -5% on Thursday, the lowest since the U.S. banking crisis of March, indicating a bias for puts, which offer protection against price drops.

17313052,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550512,1694171404,LINK Price Surge Ahead? Chainlink Sharks Bet Big On Accumulation,"Chainlink (LINK) has managed to break through the critical resistance level at $6. This unexpected surge in price can be attributed, in part, to the relentless accumulation of LINK tokens by large wallet investors, known as sharks. The trend among these influential players has been particularly pronounced, and it could hold the key to Chainlink’s bullish resurgence. On-chain date cited in a report has provided valuable insights into this remarkable shift in Chainlink’s fortunes. According to their data, the shark tier of investors has swiftly acquired a staggering $9.6 million worth of LINK tokens within just three days. This surge in demand from these heavyweights is expected to act as a significant catalyst for further upward movement in LINK’s price. Related Reading: BNB Road To Recovery: Can It Thrive Amid Declining Network Engagement? Emergence Of New Shark Wallets: A Bullish Sign For Chainlink? Recent data also reveals that 98 new shark wallets have emerged within the Chainlink ecosystem since the start of the week, marking a 3.2% increase. As of Thursday, a total of 3,127 shark wallets were holding between 10,000 and 100,000 LINK tokens. This demonstrates a growing appetite among larger investors for Chainlink, further fueling the cryptocurrency’s recent rally. The current LINK price, as per CoinGecko, stands at $6.34, with a slight 0.7% decline in the past 24 hours. However, over the last seven days, LINK has seen a notable 6.4% rally, defying the broader bearish sentiment that has gripped the altcoin market. LINK market cap currently at $3.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com The accumulation of Chainlink tokens by shark investors has historically served as a powerful indicator for predicting LINK’s price movements. Previous instances have shown that when these influential players increase their holdings, it often precedes a substantial uptick in the token’s value. As such, the ongoing accumulation by sharks is a metric worth closely monitoring to gauge the future trajectory of Chainlink’s price. Potential For LINK To Break Out Against Bitcoin Prominent crypto trader Michaël van de Poppe, sharing his insights on the social media platform X, suggests that Chainlink might be on the brink of a breakout against Bitcoin (BTC). Would #Chainlink still be considered as a buy? I know, it sounds boring, but Chainlink is still going sideways and still an investment opportunity. Why would that be the case? Wouldn’t you be better off selling the entire bag and just leaving it alone for the coming period? 👇… pic.twitter.com/j52Ul93som — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) September 5, 2023 While Chainlink has recently revisited the lower end of its trading range, fluctuating between $7.27 and $5.50, LINK could signal an upward trend if it establishes a higher low price against Bitcoin on the weekly timeframe. Chainlink’s remarkable resilience and ascent above the $6 resistance level, even amidst a broader bearish altcoin market, can be attributed to the strategic accumulation of LINK tokens by large wallet investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maze: Will It Soar To $2,000 Or Stay At $1,500 In September? As new shark wallets continue to emerge, and with LINK showing signs of a potential breakout against Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency’s future prospects appear increasingly promising. Investors and traders alike will be watching closely to see if Chainlink can maintain this upward momentum in the face of ongoing market challenges.

The SEC filed suit in 2022 alleging the blockchain-based file-sharing network had violated federal securities laws with the sale of its native LBRY credits (LBC), which the firm maintained were not securities. A New Hampshire judge ruled in favor of the SEC in November and the final ruling was filed on July 11. Following the ruling, LBRY said it would shut down.  Under the ruling, LBRY must pay a $111,614 penalty. That was revised down from $22 million in May by the regulator citing the company's ""near-defunct status."" The company was also ""permanently restrained and enjoined from"" participating, directly or indirectly, in violating federal securities laws or any unregistered crypto securities offering.  ""LBRY is appealing the [court's] decision because it is unjust and incorrect,"" CEO Jeremy Kauffman wrote in an email to CoinDesk. ""The SEC has shown clear intent to use this ruling to damage the cryptocurrency industry more broadly. We won't let them.""  Blockchain platform Ripple Labs is facing similar SEC allegations over the sale of $1.3 billion in XRP tokens. Legal experts have told CoinDesk that a federal judge's July ruling partially in favor of Ripple – that direct sales of XRP to institutional investors violated securities law, but programmatic sales to retail investors through exchanges had not – could give hope to other firms involved in similar cases.  LBC has dropped about 8.7% in the past 24 hours to $0.012, CoinGecko data shows.

Despite minimal gains, the crypto is holding firm at $0.5, showcasing a remarkable resilience over the past 24 hours. However, the intriguing aspect of this scenario lies in the technical analysis and upcoming developments that may hold the key to XRP’s future trajectory. Recent price analysis reveals that XRP is currently being held in check by the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), capping its price at $0.5027. Furthermore, another significant seller congestion point looms at $0.505. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maze: Will It Soar To $2,000 Or Stay At $1,500 In September? This data paints a clear picture of the cryptocurrency’s sideways trading pattern, indicating that XRP is likely to remain within this range until it encounters a market-shifting event. The forthcoming update on the XRP Ledger has the potential to be precisely that. XRP: Current Status As of now, the Ripple native currency is priced at $0.505186 via CoinGecko, marking a modest 0.3% gain in the past 24 hours. However, its performance over the past seven days reflects a minor loss of 0.8%. According to expert analysis, traders should anticipate a consolidation phase in the range of $0.4950 to $0.5050 for the foreseeable future. XRP market cap currently at $26 billion. Chart: TradingView.com A glance at the weekly chart reveals a market in equilibrium, with neither the bulls nor the bears asserting dominance. This sentiment aligns with the declining trading volume, hinting at a potential breakout once XRP can secure a position above the interim zone of $0.55. A pivotal resistance level of $0.5848 awaits, promising a substantial rally if breached. Ledger Update The crypto community’s hopes are pinned on XRP’s upcoming update, version 1.12.0, which incorporates two transformative features. This update merges the XLS-30 Automated Market Maker (AMM) and the XLS-39 Clawback specification into the XRP Ledger’s protocol. 1/ We’re excited to announce that the XLS-30 AMM spec and XLS-39 Clawback spec have merged to the latest version of rippled 1.12.0.https://t.co/zbg8G4PHsC — RippleX (@RippleXDev) September 6, 2023 The brainchild of Ripple’s CTO, David Schwartz, and Aanchal Malhotra, RippleX’s Head of Research, the proposal behind XLS-30 aims to enhance returns for liquidity providers in the AMM while mitigating the risks posed by market volatility. Anticipated Recovery The technical indicators also hint at an impending recovery for XRP. With the cryptocurrency testing the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands, historical data suggests a tendency to revert to the indicator’s middle, indicating that the bulls might soon take charge.

42392608,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8vg3,1694165432,MicroStrategy's Large Bitcoin Impairment Losses Have Given a False Impression: Berenberg,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) will soon be able to report its bitcoin (BTC) holdings each quarter without having to recognize impairment losses if the cryptocurrency’s price drops during the period in question, after the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted to change how companies report their finances, investment bank Berenberg said in a report Wednesday.  Since adopting its bitcoin acquisition strategy in August 2020, MicroStrategy has reported $2.23 billion of cumulative impairment losses, the report said.  MicroStrategy’s largest impairment loss of $917.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2022, and the loss featured heavily in news coverage of the earnings, “giving the impression that the company’s inherent value had been negatively impacted when this was not the case,” the bank said.  “The change should help MSTR and other companies that hold digital assets to eliminate the poor optics that have been created by impairment losses under the rules that FASB has had in place,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  On Wednesday, the FASB voted to let companies use fair-value accounting in a move that will allow firms to show gains and losses immediately on their income statements. The FASB is expected to formally approve final language later this year and companies at that point can adopt the new standards.  Michael Saylor, executive chairman of MicroStrategy, said in a tweet that the rule update “eliminates a major impediment to corporate adoption of bitcoin as a treasury asset.”  Berenberg notes that the FASB stated that the new rules will go into effect as soon as 2025, but companies will have the option to apply them before then. It says that MicroStrategy will exercise that option.  The German bank has a buy rating on MicroStrategy shares, with a price target of $510. The stock closed at $353.07 on Thursday.  U.S. investment bank Stifel said that American companies could be increasingly receptive to holding digital assets on their books, especially during periods when the market is hot, given the improved impacts to the bottom line.

42392617,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bg8wL5,1694162088,"U.S. Interest Rates High Enough to Tame Inflation, Avoid Recession: Chicago Fed","Economists at the Chicago Fed argue that rate increases implemented since March 2022 have set inflation on a path to 2% while ensuring soft landing for the economy.  Further tightening may not be needed, the economists say.  A recession-free return to that level of inflation might spur risk taking in global financial markets.  Risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, seem headed for a goldilocks moment as new research from economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago suggesting the U.S. central bank has raised interest rates high enough to cut inflation to its 2% target without sparking a recession.  In the September edition of the Chicago Fed Letter, Stefania D'Amico and Thomas King say their vector autoregression (VAR) model shows the 500 basis points of rate increases implemented since March 2022 have taken a substantial toll on output, and further hikes may not be necessary to bring prices under control. The so-called tightening cycle was partly responsible for last year's crypto market crash.  ""We estimate that although the majority of the effects on output and inflation have already occurred, the policy tightening that has already been implemented will exert further restraint in the quarters ahead, amounting to downward pressure of about 3 percentage points on the level of real gross domestic product (GDP) and 2.5 percentage points on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) level,"" they noted. ""The abatement of inflation occurs without a recession, as real GDP growth remains in positive territory throughout the projection.""  According to the model, the headline consumer price index will probably drop below 2.3% by mid-2024, which, according to the economists, equates to a 2% inflation rate as measured by the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index. The Fed has long maintained that that level is consistent with its mandate for maximum employment and price stability. D'Amico and King's model does not signal rate cuts or outright liquidity easing ahead.  A combination of sliding inflation and a relatively resilient economy would mean a so-called goldilocks scenario, which is an ideal situation for risk-taking in global financial markets. Ever since the Fed began raising rates, markets have worried that the tightening would break something in the global economy, leading to another financial crash.  The forecast from D'Amico and King comes as worries that headline CPI, which has dropped to 3% from 9% in the past 12 months, might rebound, sparked by a renewed rally in oil and food prices amid signs of a trough in prices paid in manufacturing and service sectors. That has markets concerned the Fed may hold rates elevated for longer.  Several investment banks have predicted an end of the tightening cycle while maintaining that rates are likely to stay higher for longer than previously expected.  The Fed, however, has been wary of signaling an end of the rate-hike cycle. According to the VAR model, the Fed's persistent explicit forward guidance has made expectations a more critical influence in reducing the time for rate increases to affect inflation and the economy.  ""A strong expectations channel also means a more powerful monetary policy, so the estimated effects not only occur faster, but also are bigger than typically estimated,"" the letter said. ""This implies that the effects that are yet to come may still be big enough to bring inflation near target reasonably quickly.""",POSITIVE,없음,COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/09/08/us-interest-rates-high-enough-to-tame-inflation-avoid-recession-chicago-fed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ac91666ce6242609c05b5edf7cfa908bd7a4352d-3881x2183.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

17305387,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550478,1694160647,Bitcoin Analysis: Why 2024 Will Be The Highest Returning Year This Cycle,"In a recent comprehensive report by Capriole Investments, Charles Edwards presents a compelling case for why 2024 will be a pivotal year for Bitcoin, potentially offering the highest returns in its current four-year cycle. The report delves into multiple facets of Bitcoin’s future, including its role as an inflation hedge, the upcoming Halving event, and the impact of imminent ETF approvals. A Confluence Of Catalysts For Bitcoin Edwards begins by addressing the skepticism surrounding Bitcoin’s performance as an inflation hedge. “Bitcoin gets a hard rep for its performance coming out of 2021 amidst growing inflation,” he notes. Contrary to popular belief, Edwards asserts, “Bitcoin was a great inflation hedge – it was when it needed to be.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Drop Before Halving Expected, Will It Get Worse In September? He emphasizes Bitcoin’s impressive 1000% rise from Q1-2020 to Q1-2021, outpacing all other asset classes. This surge, he explains, was a direct response to the Federal Reserve’s multi-trillion-dollar QE packages announced in March 2020. “Markets today move incredibly fast and are forward looking. As soon as macro announcements are made, the pricing-in begins,” Edwards states. Drawing a comparison between Bitcoin and traditional hedges, Edwards points out that Bitcoin’s performance during the liquidity boom was unparalleled. “There is no doubt that Bitcoin dominated the crisis as the best inflation hedge,” he asserts, adding, “There is no second best. Bitcoin was the greatest inflation hedge we have ever seen.” The second crucial catalyst for Bitcoin is the upcoming halving in April 2024. Edwards highlights the gravity of this event, stating, “The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April will drop Bitcoin’s supply growth rate to 0.8% p.a. and below that of Gold (1.6%) for the first time ever.” This means that “In April 2024, Bitcoin will for the first time become harder than Gold.” Addressing the common argument that the Halving is already priced in, Edwards counters, “If there is one thing we have learnt from Bitcoin’s past it’s that the halving is never priced in.” He argues that 80% cycle drawdowns reset all interest in Bitcoin. Furthermore, Edwards draws parallels to previous cycles, noting that many on-chain metrics indicate that the current cycle mirrors those of 2019 and 2015 exactly. Third, Edwards also touches upon the regulatory landscape, highlighting the clarity brought about by the CFTC’s classification of Bitcoin as a commodity in 2021. He also mentions the significant announcement of Blackrock’s Bitcoin ETF application and the federal appeals court’s order for the SEC to reconsider its rejection of the Grayscale spot ETF. His base case expectation is that the SEC will approve the spot ETF either in October 2023 or January 2024. Related Reading: JPMorgan Adjusts Bitcoin’s Production Cost: What This Means For BTC And Its Miners? Discussing the potential impact of ETFs on Bitcoin, Edwards draws a parallel to Gold, noting the significant bull run that followed the approval of the Gold ETF in 2004. “When the Gold ETF approval hit, what followed was a massive +350% return, seven-year bull-run,” the analyst remarked, adding, “so, we have three incredible catalysts on the very near horizon,” he states, listing the upcoming halving, imminent ETF approvals, and Bitcoin’s status as the best inflation hedge. In conclusion, Edwards presents a bullish yet cautious outlook. While he acknowledges the short-term bearish signals, he remains optimistic about the long-term prospects. “In Bitcoin’s four-year cycles, there’s typically 12-18 months where 90% of returns happen, followed by 2-3 years of sideways and down,” he observes, adding, “I am expecting that the single highest returning year of this cycle will be 2024 and I believe the data supports that thesis.” At press time, BTC surged to $26,246, up 1.8% in the last 24 hours.

A judicial fine of 135 million liras ($5 million approx.) was also imposed.  Thodex was one of Turkey's largest crypto exchanges before it suddenly went offline in April 2021 and Özer went missing. Over 400,000 members were left in the dark without access to deposits of $2 billion in cryptocurrencies. Özer had fled to Albania but was arrested in August 2022 after an Interpol red notice against him.  By April 2023, Özer was extradited to Turkey, and detained by police upon arrival on seven charges, including establishing and managing an organization with the purpose of committing a crime, being a member of an organization, fraud by using information systems as a tool of banks or credit institutions, fraud of merchants or company executives and cooperative managers, and laundering the value of assets resulting from crime.  When the case came to light, Özer's brother, sister and four other senior employees were jailed and at least 83 people were detained as part of the investigation. The eventual trial saw 21 defendants facing up to 40,564 years in prison.  The Anatolian 9th Heavy Penal Court announced the verdict on Thursday, acquitting 16 of the 21 defendants and releasing four of the seven jailed due to a lack of evidence. Other defendants were given varying degrees of imprisonment for various crimes.

The decline in network activity has played a pivotal role in hindering price momentum for BNB, leaving investors and enthusiasts eager for a turnaround. BNB’s recent price action has been characterized by extended periods of sideways movement. The bears have proven resilient at the resistance level, preventing prices from breaching the $225 mark. Currently, BNB is trading at $216.80, according to CoinGecko, with 24-hour gains of a modest 0.8%. Over the past seven days, the coin has seen a marginal decline of 0.1%, leaving investors and enthusiasts eagerly awaiting signs of a potential price rebound. Related Reading: XRP Bulls On The Horizon: Could A Breakout Push Prices Above $0.6? BNB seven-day price action. Source: Coingecko BNB Hinging On Bitcoin’s Performance For bulls hoping to witness an upward movement in BNB’s price, their hopes might rest largely on Bitcoin’s shoulders. A significant breakthrough for Bitcoin above the $26,000 mark could inject much-needed bullish sentiment into the broader market, potentially benefiting BNB in the process. Technical price analysis paints a rather bleak picture for BNB. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reflects the lack of demand for BNB, with a brief spike above the neutral 50 on August 30 quickly followed by a decline below the neutral 50. As of the latest data, the RSI remains in this bearish territory. Additionally, the On-Balance Volume (OBV) has witnessed significant drops in trading volume, both in early June and late August. These sharp declines have contributed to BNB’s lateral price movement, further reinforcing the prevailing bearish market structure. BNB market cap currently at $33 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Regulatory Woes And Executive Exodus Adding to BNB’s challenges is the regulatory scrutiny Binance, the platform behind BNB, has been facing recently. The exchange has been in the crosshairs of regulators worldwide, and the situation has been exacerbated by the departure of several high-ranking executives. Mayur Kamat, Binance’s head of product, is the latest in a string of senior executives to leave the company, marking the fourth such departure. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Maze: Will It Soar To $2,000 Or Stay At $1,500 In September? As BNB grapples with these obstacles, experts in the field predict that the coin may experience further downward pressure. According to a price report, some experts anticipate BNB’s price to drop to $208 by September 19. Binance Coin’s prospects remain uncertain as it navigates a challenging landscape characterized by declining network activity, technical indicators flashing warning signs, regulatory hurdles, and executive departures. The fate of BNB appears intertwined with the broader cryptocurrency market’s performance, and investors and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring developments in the coming weeks.

17286977,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=550455,1694134854,"Bitcoin Drop Before Halving Expected, Will It Get Worse In September?","Benjamin Cowen, an analyst and founder of Into The Cryptoverse, thinks Bitcoin will likely maintain a downside trajectory in September ahead of next year’s halving. Pointing to the coin’s performance and comparing it to how Bitcoin has faired over the years, the analyst predicts doom for the world’s most valuable cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is trading at around $25,860 and has remained under pressure in the past few weeks after surging almost 60% from November 2022 lows, when the drop was accelerated by the collapse of FTX and the bankruptcy of several centralized finance (CeFi) lending platforms like BlockFi, the coin retraced from July 2023 peaks when it rallied to around $31,800. Will September Be Tough For BTC Bulls? After an impressive performance in July, bears peeled back all gains in August. By the close of the month, Bitcoin was down roughly 20% from July 203 highs, with losses on August 17 triggering a scare across the board. In his analysis, Cowen notes that the coin lost 11.31% in August, slightly lower than the average of the past two pre-halving years when the mean return that month when the coin shrunk by 11.71%. However, his projections for BTC look dimmer in September. The analyst, citing data, said prices tend to contract in all of September before halving. The average return stood at -17.29% in September before Bitcoin halved. Therefore, if the same holds and Bitcoin follows the same trend, the coin will likely dump to $21,400 by the end of this month. Related Reading: Make Or Break: Bitcoin Fate Hangs On The Edge Of The 200-Week EMA On the “brighter” side, if the performance of Bitcoin in September in the last two halvings is factored in, the average return was -5.66%, which means BTC, though bearish, could end up falling to around $24,400 by the end of the month. This assessment implies that if historical performance leads, BTC may edge even lower in the next few weeks. Which Way For Bitcoin? Bitcoin supporters are bullish over the medium to long term. Despite the sharp dump on August 17, which pushed the coin to new H2 2023 lows at around $25,200, the slight recovery in the second half of August and the first week of September might anchor bulls’ hopes. Bitcoin is not out of the woods just yet, looking at price action. Related Reading: Polygon Foundation Refutes Claims Of Dumping MATIC On Binance – Here’s What Happened From the daily chart, BTC prices are inside the bear candlestick of August 17, the main anchor bar that defines the current price action. Besides, though prices are relatively higher, trading volumes are relatively low. For a refreshing recovery, supporters are banking on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This derivative product would allow institutions to gain exposure, channeling capital and potentially driving demand for BTC.
