42379576,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYfL,1499810423,Indian Police Prepare Charges Against OneCoin Founder Ruja Ignatova,"Authorities in India have prepared charges against the founder of OneCoin, the digital currency investment scheme widely believed to be fraudulent.  According regional news source The Indian Express, the Economic Offenses Wing of the Navi Mumbai Police has put together a charge sheet – in which allegations are formally laid out – that includes dozens of promoters connected to OneCoin. Those involved are accused of taking thousands of dollars from investors.  Police have been cracking down on proponents of OneCoin for months, dating back to April, when police arrested a group of individuals following a promotional event. India is among a number of countries worldwide in which law enforcement agencies have pursued investigations against OneCoin.  Among those being charged is Ruja Ignatova, who founded OneCoin and has largely been viewed as the public face of the scheme, appearing at events worldwide, including an appearance in May at one in Macau. A group of ""nearly 30"" people have been charged as a result of the Mumbai police investigation.  The publication further added that, as it stands, investigators are having difficulty talking about the suspected fraud with some of those involved. The reason: fears of potential legal liability for taking part in what has been described as a Ponzi scheme.  ""In this sort of scheme, investors become the perpetrators as well as victims. It is clear that this is a Ponzi scheme,"" Tushar Doshi, a senior law enforcement official, told the Express.  Police have also been stymied as they look to recover funds. Officials told the publication that as funds were being seized from related bank accounts, some of the money was withdrawn by outside sources.

42379571,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYaJ,1499805618,BlackRock Strategist: Cryptocurrency Market Charts Look 'Pretty Scary',"The chief investment strategist for the world's biggest asset manager expressed caution about the state of the cryptocurrency market in new comments to reporters.  BlackRock chief strategist Richard Turnill spoke after the firm – which manages more than $5tn in assets as of the end of March – released its mid-year investment outlook for 2017. While that report doesn't contain any analysis of the cryptocurrency market or the firm's predictions for its development, Turnill offered his take on the market today.  According to Reuters, Turnill, in reference to the state of the cryptocurrency market, remarked: ""I look at the charts, and to me that looks pretty scary.""  Cryptocurrency markets have seen significant declines in recent days, with the price of ether, the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network, dropping below the $200 mark for the first time since the end of May.  In remarks, Turnill also said that, in his view, the market wouldn't pose any risks to the broader financial market in the event of a steeper sell-off.  ""There's no evidence that if that price went to zero tomorrow that there'd be any broader financial implication over time, but to me it is example of where you're getting some big price movements in the market,"" he said.

42379574,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYXn,1499797245,Immature Code or Good Test? Bitcoin Scaling Proposal Segwit2x's Testnet Forks,"Controversial bitcoin scaling proposal Segwit2x's testnet forked yesterday, creating two different and incompatible testnets.  Nodes running older bitcoin software continued on as they normally would. But nodes running the new Segwit2x code stalled at block 27070, meaning mining pools running the new software were not mining blocks.  Overall, the nodes were stalled for over 20 hours as a result of the issue.  While there wasn't any real money on the line, the community was abuzz with the news, some dismissing the controversial scaling proposal for perceived lingering issues, while others defended the misstep as only a small stumbling block that wouldn't happen during a live deployment.  Too little, too late  Some developers argue the fork is a symptom of a larger trend of Segwit2x developers not listening to other developers who have worked with the bitcoin code for a long time. Bitcoin Core developers, for example, have provided feedback, pointing out perceived errors, but some of that has been ignored.  On social media, some argued the testnet fork stemmed from the implementation of the 2MB hard fork developers discussed and disagreed upon a couple of weeks ago.  The 2MB hard fork is the second part of the Segwit2x proposal, an effort to double the block size parameter, which will happen three months after the Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation.  This second part is important in that if not everyone in the bitcoin ecosystem upgrades to the 2MB increase (and many say they don't plan to), bitcoin could split into two assets. If that split is not made permanent, one chain could ""wipeout"" transactions that occur on the other chain, potentially leading users to lose money.  On the project's GitHub, developers had different ideas of how to solve that.  Segwit2x went forward with software that requires at least the first block is greater than 1MB. Some contend this is what lead to the testnet fork, since there weren't enough transactions in the mempool, the part of the network where transactions are collected before being selected for blocks.  Bitcoin developer James Hilliard had proposed what he calls a ""simpler and better"" way of implementing so-called ""wipeout protection,"" where nodes insert a piece of data making their blocks invalid to the other network.  Still, given that it's slated to be deployed in two weeks, for many, the bottom line is that it's too late for the code to have serious issues.  Working group members are expected to install and test the code this Friday. Then, mining pools, companies and users are expected to begin running the code on the main bitcoin network as soon as July 21.  Jokers to blame  But Bloq co-founder and BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik argued the fork is not an event to worry about. One of the testnet miners simply triggered an event sooner than planned and without preparation from the working group participants, he said.  According to Garzik, this split wouldn't happen once Segwit2x is deployed on the main bitcoin network.  He told CoinDesk:  ""It falls into the category of 'jokers can disrupt test networks, because test networks have very little mining power security.'""  BTC.com's Boaz Bechar, who's also working on the Segwit2x implementation, offered a similar explanation.  While the testnet isn't expected to have many transactions flowing through it, the main bitcoin network will.  ""Although unexpected timing, this is otherwise a good field test,"" Garzik wrote on the Segwit2x working group mailing list. ""This is the whole reason for a test network, after all.""

42379567,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYSl,1499792716,R3 Beefs Up DLT Security With Intel's Newly Revealed Xeon Processor,"R3 is expanding work with computer giant Intel to bring a new layer of hardware security to its distributed ledger platform.  Announced today at an unveiling event for Intel's Xeon Scalable Processors in New York, the partnership will seek to incorporate the hardware protections into R3's open-source Corda distributed ledger platform.  While Intel's newly revealed Xeon Scalable processors are designed to give any highly regulated company the security to run their products using cloud computing, R3's lead platform engineer said the hardware is especially suited for the banking consortium's 80 members.  By integrating Xeon into Corda, members will be able to capitalize on a shared, distributed ledger on which they can all agree, without worrying about regulators cracking down on them for failing to protect user privacy.  Lead platform engineer at R3, Mike Hearn, told CoinDesk:  ""What it allows you to do is send a counterparty a chain of custody, proof that an asset or a current state of the ledger has a valid history. Yet, the counterparty can't actually read that history itself. They can only process it to verify that it is valid and that the rules were followed.""  Intel's new Xeon scalable processors can be configured to store up to 28 of the company's high-performance cores, and can support up to 5x more transactions per second than previous solutions, according to the statement.  Overall, the move marks a continuation of earlier work first laid out in a white paper last year written by Hearn, who is perhaps best known as a former core developer for the open-source bitcoin project.  Since at least last year R3 has been exploring Intel's software guard extensions (SGX), designed to provide a higher degree of security than software alone. But with the release of Xeon, the first server-side chip with SGX on it, Hearn said the cloud security R3's heavily regulated members demand will be even more easily met.  The vice president of Intel's software and services group, Rick Echevarria, said the processors have the potential to improve the security of a number of distributed ledger solutions.  ""R3's collaborative approach and Corda platform places R3 in a unique position to drive the evolution of market infrastructure for the next generation of financial services,"" he said in a statement.  Hearn went on to acknowledge skeptics of the idea that centralized hardware should be integrated into a decentralized infrastructure like a blockchain, but joined a number of supporters who argue there's some things that software still just can't provide.  Hearn even expanded the possible uses of secure hardware to the cryptocurrency space he recently left, concluding:  ""There's a lot of applications around the whole cryptocurrency space. It's a very interesting and powerful tool that allows you to solve many problems that people have struggled with for years when all they had was math.""

42379572,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYZ3,1499788807,Swiss Government Says It's 'Swiftly' Developing Digital Currency Rules,"Switzerland's government said today that it is ""swiftly"" moving toward a legal designation of digital currencies.  In a statement, the Swiss Federal Council – a body of seven that collectively serve as Switzerland's head of state – revealed the first major steps of its plans to regulate fintech development in the country. CoinDesk reported in February that the government was moving to put a legal framework for fintech in place. The new rules, approved on July 5, go into effect in August.  Among the initiatives launched today is a regulatory ""sandbox"" aimed at creating a more accommodative environment for startups. Firms that accept fewer than 1 million Swiss francs (roughly $1m USD) ""will be exempt from authorization"" the Federal Council said. The group clarified that depositors with these firms would not be covered under the country's deposit protection rules.  What remains unclear is precisely how the country will regulate digital currencies, though the government indicated that it wants to move quickly to put a ""legal qualification"" in place, stating:  ""The Federal Council will continue to closely follow further developments in the areas of digitalisation and fintech, and examine further regulatory measures. The corresponding work, i.e. on clarifying the legal qualification of virtual currencies, has been taken over and is to be swiftly pursued.""  The outcome of the process could have implications for both exchange startups working in the country as well some of the businesses that work with digital currencies, including Swiss rail service SBB, which began selling bitcoin through its ticket kiosks last fall.  Switzerland has emerged as a hub for startups working with the tech, and some of its municipal bodies have moved to integrate blockchain into their operations. Last week, the city of Zug revealed that it is launching a digital identity service that, beginning in September, will use technology developed by the ethereum development community ConsenSys and Swiss startup ti&m.

42379566,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYRV,1499785165,Fabric 1.0: Hyperledger Releases First Production-Ready Blockchain Software,"Open-source software isn't so much built, it grows.  And today, the open-source blockchain consortium Hyperledger has announced that its first production-ready solution for building applications, Fabric, has finished that process.  But even before the formal release of Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 today, hundreds of proofs-of-concept had been built. With contributions to the platform for building shared, distributed ledgers across a number of industries (coming from 159 different engineers in 28 organizations), no single company owns the platform, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation.  For those going forward with that work, the group's executive director Brian Behlendorf indicated that production-grade functionality is just a download and a few tweaks away.  Behlendorf told CoinDesk:  ""It's not as easy as drop in and upgrade. But the intent is that anyplace where there were changes, that those changes will be justified.""  Once existing users of Fabric's previous versions ""grab"" the new version 1.0 code, as Behlendorf described the process, a few changes to the interface will need to be made, and any changes made to the ""Chaincode"" already being used from the earlier version will need to be modified.  While changes to the application programming interface (API) that integrates a user's software with Fabric were kept to a minimum, Behlendorf said the improvements will be noticeable.  Specifically, he highlighted improved support for Fabric’s ""private channels,"" which enable transactions in a ""subset of the broader chain"" with the same degree of reliability as the overall network.  According to Behlendorf, these improvements are fundamental for providing varying degrees of access to information (such as a provenance tracking company that needs to prove the origin of an object to its very source), while still protecting the price paid in a business transaction, for example.  ""You'll still be able to provide proof of those transactions to the broader network if you ever need,"" he explained. ""But at least on that private channel you can get the speed and confidentiality that you get with direct connection.""  Already in use  Even before today's launch, an unknown number of companies were already building increasingly mature products using earlier versions of Fabric.  Though exact numbers of projects using the open-source software are impossible to gauge due to an intentional lack of tracking software, Behledorf estimates the number is in the ""high hundreds to low thousands,"" based on how many members are in the consortia and publicly disclosed endeavors.  But to give an idea of the diversity of companies exploring the technology, contributions to the Fabric codebase were made by engineers with day jobs at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC), Digital Asset Holdings, Fujitsu, GE, Hitachi, Huawei Technologies, State Street Bank and more, according to a statement.  Among the 30 or so projects that are tracked on the Hyperledger site, are ones including companies such as the Santiago Stock Exchange, Swift and the TMX Group.  Rob Palatnick, chief technology architect of the DTCC, a founding Hyperledger member, explained in a statement why his company was an advocate of the open-source technology.  Palatnick said:  ""The Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 release marks a significant milestone in the evolution of enterprise DLT technology, and represents another step forward in making DLT adoption across critical sectors a reality.""  Beyond Fabric  While Fabric was the first Hyplerledger project to be incubated after its original codebase was donated to Linux by IBM, and the first to enter active status earlier this year, it is far from the only offering by the consortium.  Of the 145 members, several have made other open-source contributions for further development.  Notably, Behlendorf said that blockchain identity platform Indy has completed its migration from the Sovrin Foundation that originally developed it, and that ""development is picking up steam.""  Also, developers from the Intel-contributed Sawtooth project are now ""working with"" developers from Monax-contributed Burrow ""to get the ethereum virtual machine running on top of Sawtooth"" as its smart contract engine, he added.  ""That's the kind of modularity that we’d like to see happen across our different projects,"" Behlendorf said, concluding:  ""The collaboration between these different things suggests a future path of an emergent architecture coming out of the soup.""

The trial proceeded in the Tokyo District Court on July 11, where Karpeles was indicted for diverting $3m in customer funds to his own account in late 2013, and allegedly, fabricating his account balance inside the exchange platform. The 32-year-old defendant denied such allegations.  Kolin Burges, a software developer in London and a Mt Gox creditor also president at the trial, said in a Tweet that ""Karpeles admits operating Willy bot...but says it was for good of company so not illegal.""  As reported in 2014, the ""Willy bot"" was suspected of being the vehicle by which fraudulent trading activity was conducted on the exchange in 2013 during a rapid uptick in global prices.  The Japan-based bitcoin exchange first filed bankruptcy protection in February 2014, with an outstanding debt of ¥6.5bn ($63.6m), amidst a loss of 850,000 bitcoins, which according to Mt Gox's explanation was due to a software security flaw that was breached by hackers.  The case became prominent as many of the stolen bitcoins belonged to Mt Gox customers, a fact that did much to raise eyebrows regarding the security, safety and regulation issues around cryptocurrencies.  Still, it's worth noting the collapse has had a broadly positive impact on domestic markets, as in April this year, Japan became the first country in the world to regulate bitcoin as a legal payment method in response.

42379573,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYbZ,1499779803,Bitcoin Hedge Fund Director: ICOs Are Having a 'Eureka' Moment,"The director of one of the first bitcoin hedge funds offered praise for initial coin offerings (ICOs) today, arguing in an investor note that the novel fundraising method is already showing signs of significant advances.  The new comments shed light on how Global Advisors, a Jersey-based investment firm that buys and sells cryptocurrency, sees changes in the broader crypto markets, which have so far seen a boom in fundraising via custom digital assets in 2017.  Recalling this broader increase, the company's director, Daniel Masters, a former energy trader with J.P. Morgan, went so far as to argue that it is the appreciation of alternative cryptocurrencies and ethereum assets that has become the driver of bitcoin's price.  ""It was other coins and tokens that were driving value, outperforming bitcoin while dragging the whole complex higher,"" he wrote.  Still, Masters believes that, while often dismissed as a ""bubble"" or a ""fad"", ICOs have become the breeding ground for real advances. In particular, he cited the now-ended ICO for Bancor, in which the project aimed at improving smart contracts raised $160m in cryptocurrency.  Lauding the mechanics of the sale as ""striking,"" he asserted that Bancor was able to use blockchain technology to offer services that transcend traditional services like Kickstarter.  ""Bancor gave a money-back guarantee backed by 80% of the ethereum raised should the market price of [its BNT token] fall below the issue price. Sure enough, a few days later in an overall market sell off, BNT traded to par. Bancor issued a statement saying the buy-back was activated,"" he wrote.  Overall, Masters sees this type of ""coded instruction"" as a ""eureka moment"" showcasing what he thinks is evidence of the truly disruptive power of peer-to-peer digital assets.  He concluded:  ""This differs significantly from the methodology to date where, ironically, centralized exchanges have been the nexus for transactions not just from fiat money to digital assets but also amongst and between assets.""

42379568,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYVH,1499778006,Defending Borders with Blockchain: Former Cheney Advisor Calls for Action,"A new type of cyber forensics could soon make it impossible for a nation's adversaries to sabotage equipment acquired for the defense sector.  Published by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, DC-based think tank, a new research memo released today details how blockchain technology could be used to prevent maliciously modified hardware components from being built into infrastructure deemed crucial to national security.  While the paper, published by the foundation's Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance, is geared toward protecting the interests of US national security, the principals seem to apply to any nation with high volumes of supply chain transaction data.  Memo authors, Samantha Ravich, previously the deputy national security advisor to former US Vice President Dick Cheney, and Michael Hsieh, a former DARPA program manager, describe how hardware imported from a ""verifiably dangerous provenance"" could be a threat to the ""physical security"" of the US.  The authors of the report, entitled ""Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Protect the National Security Industrial Base from Supply Chain Attacks,"" write:  ""The increasing globalization of manufacturing supply chains will continue to drive broad-based, productivity-led economic growth around the world well into the 21st century. But it also poses national security challenges of existential urgency as the technologically-complex electronic hardware that comprises our national security industrial base (NSIB) is increasingly produced or assembled in countries with documented histories of large-scale, technologically-sophisticated economic espionage against the United States.""  The memo, which was written for non-technical readers, describes how legacy systems for acquiring international goods could be transformed with blockchain technology to make clear the origins of any number of goods used to build what the foundation calls the national security industrial base, or NSIB.  Perpetrators of such threats engage in what the memo calls cyber-enabled economic warfare (CEEW) as a way to undermine an adversary's economy, and ""reduce its political and military power."" So-called ""strategic"" attacks aim to undermine a nation's entire infrastructure by introducing hardware components whose malicious purpose is ""often carefully obfuscated,"" according to the paper.  Shedding light on the 'fog'  On multiple occasions, the paper specifically alleges such practices have been employed by China, based on one report by the US-China Economic Security Review Commission and another by the Senate Armed Services Committee. However, Afghanistan is also mentioned and other nations are alluded to.  To shed light on the ""fog"" created by high volumes of transactions, lack of standardization and inadequate records, the memo's authors call for the widespread movement of supply chain data to a blockchain that is perpetually scanned by artificial intelligence in search for criminal patterns.  For example, the paper cites an audit report by the Special Investigator General of the Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) in which it was revealed that a team of bomb-makers was allegedly working with the supply chain contractors for two days, in spite of being ""explicitly blacklisted.""  ""Infected components are also potentially entering our national civil infrastructure en masse as well because civil enterprises share the same supply chain risks,"" the authors write. ""In a conflict scenario, the collapse of the domestic economy would not only degrade national morale but disrupt the primary source of material support for U.S. forces.""  They go on to say:  ""The simplest problem of excluding known bad actors is almost immediately solved with a blockchain-based dynamical graph of transactions.""  Call to action  After reaffirming the policy recommendations of the April 2017 Defense Science Board report – which was notably did not contain a single mention of blockchain or distributed ledger technology – the authors make a number of recommendations and warnings.  First, they recommend the formation of small-scale experiments conducted by tech-savvy ""communities,"" the development of a set of requirements for “prime contractors” who are “able and willing” to accept a “blockchain-based payment system”, and the updating of privacy requirements within the current Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations (DFAR) pertaining to contractor information.  Specifically, a footnote near the end of the report mentions several supply chain firms in the blockchain space as examples of the types of work for which the authors advocate: BlockVerify (pharmaceuticals), Everledger (diamonds) and Provenance (general), which just yesterday raised $800,000 in venture capital.  Second, the authors recommend that ""legislative and regulatory action should be taken in partnership with industry.""  Regulatory warning  Buried in a footnote among the recommendation is warning that the laws that require US government entities to protect the privacy of their citizens may also apply to any contractor also employing such a supply chain.  ""Further clarification on the possibly conflicting interpretations of the existing regulations for federal acquisitions will be required to ensure compliance for any pilot activity,"" the footnote reads.  The authors conclude:  ""Securing the NSIB supply chain is a systems engineering challenge of unprecedented dimensions. Essentially, the problem at hand is to police a corpus of commercial activity which, if only counting the Department of Defense, would comprise the 20th largest economy in the world. While the blockchain, as a new technology, entails extraordinary risks, it also bears extraordinary promise as a tool uniquely suited to such problems of singular scale and complexity.""

During the day's session, the price of one ether token hit an inter-day low of $192.22 across major exchanges, its lowest value in over 40 days of trading, according to data from cryptocurrency price information provider Coinmarketcap.  At press time, the value had recovered to $198, but the fall to $192 still marked a more than 50% drop from all-time highs above $400 observed in early June, a time when excitement over initial coin offerings (ICOs) and new mainstream attention were perhaps driving new users more aggressively to the platform.  Even with the declines, though, the price of ether is still up substantially over the course of 2017, having risen over 2,000% from roughly $8 on 1st January. Further, while it has yet to surpass bitcoin's total value, as some had predicted, there is still broad optimism about the asset among traders, who believe it to be a rare cryptocurrency that has established a viable value proposition by enabling token issuance.  Nonetheless, the decline in ether's price, which at press time was down nearly 17% on the day, has so far coincided with a broader sell-off in the global cryptocurrency markets.  At time of writing, the total value of the token supplies for all publicly traded cryptocurrencies was just above $80bn, a figure that is down from over $100bn last week, and that also represented the lowest total observed since late May.

42379565,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYQF,1499767208,Little-Known Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Seeks $200 Million in SEC Filing,"A little-known, newly established hedge fund is seeking to raise $200m to invest in cryptocurrencies, according to regulatory filings.  The bid by Cryptocurrency Fund LP to raise the money was revealed in a Form D submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), dated July 10. The funding effort has a minimum contribution threshold of $100,000 from accredited investors, who have at least $5m net worth.  The filing represents the latest bid to attract large-scale investors to funds built around cryptocurrency markets. In recent weeks, several existing investors in the space have moved to build similar efforts, including a $100m bid to build an ICO-focused fund that has raised roughly a third of that amount to date.  Yet in the case of Cryptocurrency Fund LP, the big-ticket fundraise objective stands in contrast to the relatively scarce amount of available information about the company.  Public records show that the filing was submitted by CEO Pavlo Savchuk, with the venture itself being registered in Las Vegas, Nevada, on June 26. An associated firm, Cryptocurrency Capital LLC, lists Timofii Melnyk and Oleksii Yeharmin as principals. Cryptocurrency Fund LP has also made few statements to the public about its investment plans.  The company published a short post about blockchain assets on Medium, dated the same day that the fund was registered in Nevada. Its website further states that a white paper related to the initiative can be downloaded, but in a phone interview, Savchuk told CoinDesk that it's not publicly available because of pending regulatory approval.  The CEO subsequently said that, besides filing with the SEC, the fund is also obligated to obtain a license from the National Futures Associates, a self-regulatory organization for the futures industry. Until then, they are not allowed legally to present offering policies to any potential investors, he added.  Savchuk, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked as a foreign trade manager for Ukraine-based Gresa Group, which makes renewable energy production equipment, between 2013 and 2015. He further served as a securities trader for New York-based T3 Trading Group between March and May of this year, his profile states.

42379575,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8AYcp,1499763606,UK Central Bank Tests Ripple’s Interledger Protocol for Cross-Border Payments,"The Bank of England has released new details about a proof-of-concept it has developed in partnership with distributed ledger startup Ripple.  Among several fintech proofs-of-concept revealed by the UK central bank yesterday, one test involved Ripple's Interledger protocol, designed to facilitate transactions between different distributed ledger systems.  The trial centered on a cross-border payment scenario in which ""two different currencies"" were ""executed simultaneously in two different simulated RTGS [real-time gross settlement] systems,"" with blockchain potentially serving as means for synchronizing the settlement of transactions.  According to its outline of the proof-of-concept, the Bank of England used the test in part as a springboard to investigate issues around liquidity, stating:  ""Cross-border payments when applied to wholesale markets present different challenges than when compared with retail and corporate transactions, which the Ripple product is designed to handle. The availability of liquidity is one such challenge, and the PoC allowed the Bank and Ripple to begin exploring these questions.""  The bank went on to indicate that it could conduct additional trials in this area ""to extend its understanding of the dimensions of the synchronization concept.""  The Bank of England launched its fintech startup accelerator last year as part of a bid to test new technologies including blockchain, and has been trialing solutions for months. While it has stopped short of green lighting any immediate plans to replace any of its internal infrastructure, the bank is planning for its next RTGS system to be compatible with the tech.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple.
