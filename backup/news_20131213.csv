42425196,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFph,1386959458,CEO of Russian Sberbank 'Endorses Virtual Currencies',"The head of Russia's largest bank is said to have praised virtual currencies, suggesting that the bank may even enter the market if demand continues.  Online reports suggest that Sberbank CEO Herman Gref was bullish on virtual currencies during a discussion with journalists in Moscow this week. If there is demand for a virtual currency, the bank could move in that direction, he said.  Gref is also said to have singled out Yandex Money as a first step in the direction of a virtual currency. While not itself classified as money, Yandex is an Internet payment system popular in Russia, and is supported as a payment mechanism by organisations including Skype.  For virtual currency to become mainstream, however, it would need regulation, said Gref, who was also reported as saying that virtual currency ""'experiments' must end in one or two crashes"" before they are firmly established. Russia has been relatively silent on regulation of virtual currencies to date.  Any endorsement of virtual currency by Sberbank would be a significant boost for its prospects in Russia and elsewhere. The organisation is the largest bank in Russia and Eastern Europe. Bulgarian bitcoin exchange BTC-E facilities fiat exchanges via Sberbank.

42425203,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFzh,1386956417,42% of Americans Know What Bitcoin is,"According to a new Bloomberg poll, 42% of Americans know that bitcoin is a digital currency.  However, the majority of the US residents quizzed still don’t know what bitcoin actually is.  Those who were familiar with the cryptocurrency said they were still unsure what to make of it. In fact, many who were asked had questions for the pollsters too.  Those that do know, don’t know much  Of the people who had heard of bitcoin, some were hesitant to use it themselves, either in a business or personal capacity.  Olga Ruff, a 62-year-old businesswoman, said she was unlikely to start accepting bitcoin in her small jewellery shop. “What use would it be for me?” she said, adding: “I’m not sure what the value of it is, and what I’d be able to exchange it for.”  Jeremy Labadie, an internet security specialist, said he would have to consider his options further before making a purchase: “I don’t necessarily know if it’s something I would think about using.”  However Labadie also admitted that he had considered buying some bitcoins as a long-term investment.  Other respondents said they heard about bitcoin through mainstream news coverage. In turn, this had given them an idea of the currency's drawbacks as well as bitcoin-related scams and crimes.  No clear position on regulation  The most interesting part of the poll involved those who identified bitcoin correctly.  When these participants were asked whether the digital currency should remain unregulated, they were split down the middle.  The majority, 46%, said they favour bitcoin regulation. However, 39% said bitcoin should not be regulated. The remaining 16% were unsure.  It should be noted that government regulation of certain industries is a hotly debated topic in American politics, hence it tends to be controversial and opinions may be split along party lines (for example, small government versus big government).  Bitcoin: Xbox game or iPhone app?  More than 1,000 people took part in the poll and some answers were rather amusing.  A total of 46% said they do not know what bitcoin is. Suprisingly, 6% of participants thought bitcoin was an Xbox game, while another 6% were convinced it was an iOS app on the iPhone.  Unsurprisingly, the poll found that people under the age of 35 were more likely to know a thing or two about bitcoin. Additionally, they were also more likely to be in favour of keeping it unregulated.

42425207,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvG9h,1386948930,"Patent Nonsense, Coinbase Futures, and Who’s a Good Doggie? You Are!","Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review 13th December 2013 – a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.    Inventing problems  You’ve got to love Internet rumours. A bit of a Twitter-storm kicked off earlier this week, when the word went out that JP Morgan had tried to patent bitcoin.  Calmer heads prevailed: JP Morgan hadn’t tried to patent bitcoin. It had re-presented an old patent from 1999 about an online payment system with electronic wallets, but one that bore little resemblance to cryptocurrencies as we know them.  It’s a bank, after all, so why would it want to remove complexity and centralised control, two of the more lucrative aspects of the business?  But could someone spike bitcoin through patents? After all, software patents now have a long history of being used to extract money from companies and shut down competition.  Some estimates say that one in four civil lawsuits in America are patent-driven, and the big-dogs of Google, Apple, Samsung and Microsoft spend billions at the game.  It’s vanishingly unlikely, for at least three reasons. The one that’s most obvious is prior art, where a new patent can only be granted – in theory – if the invention embedded in it hasn’t been published before. As bitcoin is thoroughly published and open, then it can’t be patented.  It’s possible, indeed probable, that there are software patents which could plausibly be used to slap claims on parts of the Bitcoin protocol – the real evil of such patents is that they’re often written so vaguely it takes a court full of rich lawyers a long time to find out whether they apply in particular cases or not. But the whole thing? Nah.  If someone managed to get a patent on a bitcoin-like cryptocurrency, which remains a possibility as the US patent office is known for not being too fussy about what it grants, that wouldn’t do much harm either.  For a patent to be infringed, all of its aspects have to be infringed. You can copy a process or invention as much as you like, as long as you differ in just one point of the patented details.  Finally, and most importantly, there’s no money in it. Nobody owns bitcoin, so there’s nobody to sue. People and companies using bitcoin might be vulnerable – there are patent trolls who cause a lot of problems that way.  For example, suing people who just happen to use Wi-Fi because the trolls have bought a patent that might be applicable to something in Wi-Fi, but there are moves afoot in the US to make that sort of thing much less attractive.    Decentralised, distributed, open-source systems are in fact terribly difficult to control, technically and legally, which is why anyone with half a brain (and the morals of a pirate, natch) can still download any movie they like through bittorrent even though there’s been more than a decade of intensive government and industry fist-shaking at those darn kids.    So don’t fear the bankers. They can only mess up things they control.  Coinbase coins it    As John Law keeps banging on, the real value of bitcoin isn’t as some sort of sketchy quick-fire currency speculation vehicle, but as a basic way to securely move valuable digital anythings around the place without having someone take a cut in the middle.      If he had $25 million to invest in bitcoin, it’d go into tools like wallets and merchant software – Coinbase’s shtick – and not into the currency itself.      Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz has rather more to say on this, pointing out that key Internet protocols like HTTP (for the web) and SMTP (for email) didn’t take off until someone had created a decent web browser or mail client.      That’s an argument which clearly resonates with his company, as Marc Andreessen of that ilk made his millions through the Netscape Navigator web browser.      You may not remember Netscape Navigator, if you’re a spring chicken. It was one of the first mass-market web browsers and made all the running in the mid-to-late 90s.      At one point, nine out of ten web browsers on the planet were Netscape Navigator, and Netscape the company was one of the first dot-com headline success stories.      It all went downhill after Microsoft started to give away Internet Explorer with Windows – at that point, people still paid for browser software, shockingly – and intensively invested in improving IE.      Netscape made a few bad decisions, wrote a lot of bad software, and lost market share like nobody’s business. The company went through some painful retrenchments, eventually spawned Firefox and got bought by AOL.      Will Coinbase follow a similar trajectory? After all, bitcoin is open, just like the Web is open, and people can switch wallets and merchant services at will, just like they could hop from Netscape Navigator to Internet Explorer.      There are two ways to win – be first, or be best. Netscape was one, but not the other. Coinbase is certainly the most prominent and successful of the first-generation bitcoin companies, like Netscape and the Web. Will it be best?      Microsoft no longer dominates as the way the world accesses the Internet: Apple and Google have stronger claims.      Apple won’t allow bitcoin software on its iOS mobile platform and recently threw Coinbase’s app out of its store, although it’s unwilling to say why – but whatever the reason, it won’t be because it’s going to put its own bitcoin software up.      Microsoft was eventually found guilty of anti-trust behaviour through its Internet Explorer antics, after all. And in any case, even Apple can’t control access to Web services.      That’s one hurdle no longer in play. The other, bad software and bad planning, is entirely up to Coinbase, and if it knows how to make strategy and superior software it’s going to be a good bet.      The strategy – ease of use, paring costs to the bone, swiftness, active attention to regulation – seems good enough, so let’s hope it gets the implementation right.      It can always ask Marc about how to avoid bad code.    The doge is out of the bag    John Law is not quite sure he can explain the Doge Internet meme, except that it’s a mis-spelling of dog and appears to be a canine version of LOLCats.      It revolves around stunted phrases like Wow. So picture. Much words, Many lols. It probably makes sense if you are under 25 and heroically stoned, much like dubstep.      It’s been around for about a year, and the chances are good that your life has been in no way diminished by not making its acquaintance until now.      What makes this ephemeral event of interest to CoinDesk readers is that Doge has grown – budded, mutated, squeezed out – its own cryptocurrency, dogecoin.      Why dogecoin? That’s even more of a mystery. Like the true nature of the photon or the continued existence of BBC 3, some things have to be accepted as existing beyond the reach of mere human intellect.      Yet here it is. John Law has been mining – sorry, digging – dogecoin for a few days, and it seems to all be there. People are using to to buy things off each other. There are users. Forums. Digging pools. It doesn’t seem to have any particular cash value, but that it has some value is undeniable.      It’s not alone. There currently are over sixty cryptocurrencies listed on the Cryptsy trading platform: dogecoin isn’t part of that group, and nobody seems to have created, or have any way of creating, a definitive list of everything running on Bitcoin protocols.      If you think the powers that be are having problems defining exactly what bitcoin is, think of the fun they’ll have trying to classify all of the not-so-serious, experimental, closed or just plain daft variants that already exist.      Some, like BBQcoin, were started for fun and accidentally became valuable: that has a market capitalisation of roughly $4 million, by repute.      This is the true joke, and it’s a good one. If you doubt for a second that the genie is out of the bottle, spend a few minutes poking around the dogecoins, quarkcoins and protoshares of the altcoin world.      Not only is the bitcoin system properly independent of any central control, all such systems are so free of restraint that you or I or a bunch of stoners can create a new one for the price of a few hours with a computer and an Internet connection.      It’s not that the coins themselves can be created and traded without the usual requirement of some state machinery behind them, it’s that the entire system now belongs to the individual. It’s as uncontrollable as reading or writing.      So funnies. Wow. Much changing!    John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

42425197,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFrh,1386943055,Central Banks in New Zealand and Australia Issue Bitcoin Warning,"Representatives from the central banks of New Zealand and Australia have issued their own official warnings on bitcoin, terming the currency ""interesting, but risky"".  The banks' comments come hot on the heels of the European Banking Authority's stance today. Both comments echo the public statement issued by Chinese authorities on 5th December, which led to the price of bitcoin falling by $300 on popular exchange Mt. Gox.  New Zealand  John McDermott, assistant governor at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), said banks and businesses should “tread very carefully” with the digital currency, in a report by the Wall Street Journal. He added:  “You have to worry about [...] the supply, how it’s controlled, how it’s monitored. Who knows at this point? There is still a lot for the world to learn on this issue.”  RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler cited price volatility as a cause for concern, but said “Conceptually, the idea is very interesting — that you can have a means of payment that basically is universally accepted and basically means that you get aside capital controls, you get aside exchange rate issues.”  Australia  Next door, the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, said he was “still trying to understand” the cryptocurrency during an interview with the Australian Financial Review.  “Best I can see, it would be open to you to create a currency called the 'Michael' and get people to buy it and you could promise to, you know, only issue so much of it and if people had confidence in that they could use that as a kind of numeraire. You could measure things in Michaels. You could buy and sell them.”  “It might or might not hold its value depending on whether you keep the promise,” Stevens continued.  The comments are interesting, as Stevens seems to think bitcoin’s 21,000,000 unit limit is based on a ‘promise’ by some individual or organization (though he later acknowledged bitcoin was “based on some computer algorithm to limit supply”).  The AFR’s editor-in-chief, Michael Stutchbury, also refers to bitcoin and its contemporaries in the interview as “artificial currencies”.  He also cautioned against “speculative excesses” and said that, while it had not caused the economy “a material problem yet,” it could result in something like that favoured investment bubble trope, Tulip Mania.  However, Stutchbury did raise the interesting question of whether digital currency technology could “take us back to a world” of competing currencies.  Stevens responded that the current international economy already had competing currencies, saying there was no law against people making daily transactions in whichever national currency they chose.  He concluded with:  “There have been many bases for currencies and in the end, I suppose, the ones that will […] the ones that survive will be the ones that hold their value, which is why we have an inflation target which we’re hitting.”  Few central bank officials have issued public opinion on bitcoin before October, but the currency's recent surge in value has raised the issue to prominence.  Attention and comments from governments of the world’s two largest economies, the US and China, may prompt those in other countries to speculate for themselves.

The bumpout date is set for 21st December, and the company has already started manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs), cases and other components of the new ASIC rig.  The GoldStrike I ASIC is clocked at 1.4GHz, and capable of churning out 500GH/S.  TerraMiner components  Each TerraMiner unit features four GoldStrike I chips and is capable of yielding 2TH/s per miner. Each chip runs at 0.765 volts and it is manufactured using Globalfoundries’ 28nm high performance plus (HPP) node.  The TerraMiner IV fits into a standard 4U Enclosure (19″x 7″ x 17.8″) and it features CoolIT Systems liquid cooling and Power One platinum-certified power supply units.  CoinTerra  says it is stockpiling the necessary components and as soon as the first batch of GoldStrike I dies are packaged (FCBGA), they should be ready for production.  Each TerraMiner IV system will feature two PCBs, with two GoldStrike I chips each. Each board features its own water cooling system and heat exchanger. The two heat exchangers are cooled by three fans, with an additional two fans at the front to ensure plenty of airflow over the exchangers and the PCBs themselves.  You can check out all the gritty details on a company blog post by CoinTerra's VP of Hardware Engineering, Jim O’Connor.  Rivals: Neptune and Monarch  Although the GoldStrike I ASICs are just a few weeks away, the new TerraMiner IV systems will not be ready for a while. The first batches have already sold out. The next batch is due in April 2014, with the price set at $5,999.  This doesn't sound too cheap, but then again KnCMiner's new Neptune 20nm rigs are scheduled to ship in late Q1 or Q2 of 2014 priced at $12,995 each.  The Neptune will be available in a limited 1,200 unit batch and each unit is capable of delivering 3TH/s. It will be the first 20-nanometre bitcoin mining ASIC.  Other interesting mining hardware scheduled to appear in early 2014 includes Butterfly Labs' Monarch mining cards. Theses will be available in two flavours: a 300GH model for $2,800, or a 600GH unit priced at $4,680.

42425217,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFjh,1386936017,Swiss Government to Write Report on Dangers of Bitcoin,"The Federal Council of the Swiss government is to write a report on the dangers of bitcoin, examining the effects it could have on Switzerland's financial system and society in general.  Jean Christophe Schwaab of the Swiss Socialist Party submitted the request for the report in a postulate back in September.  At the time, he said he had submitted the request because he was concerned about the potential of bitcoin and other virtual currencies.  Luzius Meisser, president of Bitcoin Association Switzerland, said Schwaab's postulate takes a wholly negative perspective, focusing on the risks of bitcoin and ignoring the opportunities.  This is why the Parliamentary Group for Digital Sustainability (ParlDigi) recently created a subsequent postulate, which asks for any report the Federal Council creates to include information about the benefits of digital currency.  Meisser said:  ""The constructive amendment of ParlDigi ensures that the opportunities are not ignored. Furthermore, it suggests an elegant way of treating bitcoins legally - namely as foreign currency, which would be a great outcome if shared by the Federal Council.""  He went on to say that treating bitcoin like any other foreign currency would provide ""another boost in credibility for bitcoin"" as well as legal certainty for both regulators and users.  Schwaab disagrees with Meisser and said he isn't hoping for a wholly negative report. He agreed that he wants the report to focus on the potential threats, such as money laundering, but he also hopes it will consider ""the opportunities for a country with a strong financial sector like Switzerland"".  [post-quote]  Regulators beyond Switzerland have started to issue their opinions on digital currency, with the European Banking Authority (EBA) recently warning of the potential risks related to virtual currencies.  Stefan Greiner, of German law firm Xenion Legal, said: ""The recent statement from the EBA about digital currency shows the discussion about economic and financial implications of bitcoins has now definitely begun.""  He went on to say that this discussion will continue for some time before any kind of conclusions are reached.  ""For those supporting bitcoins, international cooperation is now more important than ever, as regulators will certainly cooperate on the matter,"" he added.  The Bitcoin Foundation is encouraging cooperation within the global bitcoin community by setting up an international affiliates programme. It has already signed national affiliates in Canada and Australia.  Meisser said:  ""We welcome international coordination. Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, so it also makes sense to organize global support. However, we are not that fond of the approach the US foundation takes. We've been in contact with them and its affiliate programme actually is a subsidiary programme, exerting tight control over the local chapters.""  He went on to say that, during the last bitcoin meetup in Zurich, the majority of attendees voted against entering into such an agreement, as they felt it would be against the spirit of bitcoin – which supports decentralized systems.  ""Therefore, we opted to keep Bitcoin Association Switzerland independent. This means that we will be able to decide on our own about membership fees, what we do with donations, how we organize ourselves and what our web site looks like,"" he added.  Going back to the recent regulatory developments in Switzerland, Meisser said it could be months before a report is produced, as the next parliamentary session doesn't begin until March. He is hoping, in the meantime, the Federal Council accepts the ParlDigi postulate, so its report can have some balance.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | REGULATION,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/13/swiss-government-to-write-report-on-dangers-of-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c9c01874effa339bdba69a4b08ef8a59348929b4-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425200,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFvh,1386932405,Bitcoin Mint Casascius Shut Down By US Regulators,"News has emerged that Utah-based Bitcoin Mint Casascius has stopped minting cryptocurrency, following pressure from the US government.  The company, which sold bitcoins embedded within metal coins, has reportedly been picked up by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for being an unregistered “money transmitter”.  Since coming on to the scene in 2011, around 90,000 Casascius coins have been minted. Each coin contains the private key for a bitcoin address, making them a ""secure and collectible"" offline container for the digital currency.  Casascius founder Mike Caldwell, a resident of Sandy, Utah, told Wired.com: “They considered my activity to be money transmitting.”  'Money services business'  According to Wired’s report, Caldwell received a letter from FinCEN dated 15th November, in which the regulator claimed that his business was a “money services business”.  Under US law, failing to register such a business can result in a fine of up to $5,000 per day and up to five years in prison, as well as the seizure of funds relating to the unregistered business.  On 27th November, almost two weeks after the date of the letter, Caldwell posted a notice on his site:  “For the time being, I have suspended accepting new orders, pending resolution of some concerns I have as to regulatory issues. I am anticipating a possibility of having to prequalify buyers, and am holding off taking orders until I know for sure.”  When asked if he was considering shutting down the whole business, he replied: “It’s possible. I haven’t come to a final conclusion.”  Caldwell is reportedly seeking legal advice, refusing to accept FinCEN's assertion that he is a money transmitter.  Casascius coins, made from solid brass and fine silver, are essentially cold wallets – Caldwell created private keys for each coin using an offline computer, imprinted them onto the coin and deleted the originals. (Caldwell details the process here). The coins could only be purchased using bitcoin.  To view the private key, you had to remove a protective holographic strip on the coin, meaning you could be reasonably confident nobody else had access to your bitcoin, as long as that protective strip was undamaged. (Although hackers at this year’s DEFCON conference showed it is possible to crack the coins).  Coins vs bars  According to casascius.uberbills.com, a website which tracks Caldwell’s public wallet list for Casascius coins, only around 10% of owners have broken the seal to access their bitcoins.  The most popular denomination appears to have been the 1 BTC coin, but Caldwell also created higher denomination bitcoin “bars”. Of the 74,100 BTC bars tracked, 69 have been opened.  Casascius' story is the latest development in a cat-and-mouse game between burgeoning bitcoin businesses and US regulators.  Several times this year, Mt. Gox has fallen foul of US regulators, with millions of dollars being seized from Mt. Gox bank accounts.  In May, FinCEN director Jennifer Shasky Calvery, explained her organisation's attitude to bitcoin businesses in an interview with American Banker, saying:  “Digital currencies are just a financial service, and those who deal in them are a financial institution. Any financial institution and any financial service could potentially pose an AML [anti-money laundering] threat.”  Just days before her interview, the owner of Liberty Reserve, the Costa Rica-based exchange with its own digital currency, was arrested in Spain as a result of the US and Spain's joint money laundering investigation.  Coindesk has published a series of articles by the Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation’s Regulatory Affairs Committee Marco Santoni, explaining how bitcoin businesses in the US can avoid falling foul of the law.  “Registration with FinCEN is a fairly simple exercise: 15 minutes and a few mouse clicks on FinCEN’s website will satisfy that obligation. The real burden here comes from the ongoing costs of compliance, like verifying customer information and filing Suspicious Activity Reports.”  Other problems affecting US businesses, or businesses with US customers, is that money transmitting regulations have a state component, as the founder of BitBox explained to Coindesk in September.  Thus, in addition to registering with federal regulators, businesses must also register with each of the 50 states in which they want to operate.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION,Kadhim Shubber,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/13/bitcoin-mint-casascius-shut-down-by-us-regulators,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0f1f0599dd18dde5b168cc2ac5e42e33b7b2eefe-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425191,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHvFdh,1386928810,EU Banking Regulator Issues Warning on Virtual Currencies,"The European Banking Authority (EBA) has issued a warning on potential risks related to virtual currencies, but the warning is largely focused on the possibility of fraud and theft.  The authority points out that consumers are not protected by union regulation when they buy, trade or hold virtual currencies such as bitcoin. In addition, the regulator warns that there is no guarantee that currency values will remain stable.  The EBA was apparently prompted to issue the warning due to a sudden increase in virtual currency trading and the fact that virtual currencies are constantly in the headlines.  “Consumers should be aware that exchange platforms tend to be unregulated and are not banks that hold their virtual currency as a deposit. Currently, no specific regulatory protections exist in the EU that would protect consumers from financial losses if a platform that exchanges or holds virtual currencies fails or goes out of business,” the EBA said in a statement.  Hacking and misuse  Furthermore, the EBA stressed that digital wallets are not impervious to hackers and that several cases of consumers losing “significant amounts” of digital currency have already been reported. In addition, people who choose to use virtual currency for commercial transactions are not protected by EU refund laws.  Criminal activities and tax dodging were also addressed. The EBA said the high degree of anonymity offered by virtual currency transactions can be used for nefarious purposes, including money laundering. While this part of the warning shouldn’t cause any concern for the vast majority of bitcoin investors, even they could be affected. The statement continued:  “This misuse could lead law enforcement agencies to close exchange platforms at short notice and prevent consumers from accessing or retrieving any funds that the platforms may be holding for them.”  In other words even legitimate businesses and investors could have their bitcoin assets frozen. It is unclear what would happen in that case, as such closures and the associated freeze or seizure of bitcoins would go into uncharted legal territory. This part of the warning could have far reaching implications, adding to the fear, uncertainty and doubt that still surround virtual currencies.  Check national tax frameworks  In terms of tax issues, the EBA points out that tax liabilities may apply in certain countries. This of course is regulated by national legislation rather than Union regulation, so bitcoin investors who want to stay on the safe side need to do their homework to make sure they don’t get a visit from the taxman.  Lastly the EBA warns that consumers who choose to buy virtual currencies need to understand them and refrain from investing money they “cannot afford to lose.”  The EBA warning comes hot on the heels of similar warnings and notices issued by the central banks of China, France and New Zealand.",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/12/13/eu-banking-regulator-issues-warning-on-virtual-currencies,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f1aae65e709380a620ff33773eccb34d3f333b35-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
