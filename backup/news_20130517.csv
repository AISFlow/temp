42376462,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6AhzJ,1368816807,Electronic Frontier Foundation accepts bitcoins ... again,"The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) -- an organization focused on global digital rights -- is now accepting donations in bitcoins again after having stopped two years ago ... though it's quick to add that doesn't mean it's endorsing the digital currency.  Nothing against Bitcoin, the EFF states. It's an equal-opportunity non-endorser:  ""EFF does not typically endorse products or services, and we certainly do not endorse any of the electronic payment methods that we currently accept (credit cards, PayPal, and now BitPay).""  The EFF -- a sort-of American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for the online world -- had actually begun to take bitcoin contributions a couple of years ago, but suspended that option in June 2011. Among the reasons it gave for that decision at the time was that it didn't fully understand the ""complex legal issues"" raised by Bitcoin, didn't want to mislead donors and was concerned about the appearance it was endorsing the currency.  The EFF said it returned bitcoins donated at the time using Bitcoin Faucet.  Since then, the organization has reconsidered the bitcoin donation option and has decided to again accept bitcoins for several reasons. One key factor in the decision, it said, was because, ""Censorship by payment intermediaries is an ongoing problem for free speech online – so it makes sense to start diversifying the available options.""  Probably the highest-profile example of such ""payment censorship"" was the move by numerous financial companies -- including PayPal, Mastercard and Visa -- to suspend transactions intended for Julian Assange's whistle-blowing site WikiLeaks in the wake of its publication of leaked US diplomatic cables in late 2010.  The EFF also noted that the recent guidance issued by the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) ""reduced our concerns that by accepting (b)itcoins EFF risked moving away from its role as a defender of innovators and into the role as a possible defendant.""  Finally, the EFF added, its members ""kept politely asking for"" the bitcoin option.  Bitcoin fans on reddit promptly and vigorously welcomed the decision:  ""Donated $250,"" wrote reddit user willphase. ""I had emailed them twice about this already, and I just emailed them again to thank them for finally accepting USD via the bitcoin payment system as well as via paypal and credit card processors. Seemed like a no brainer for me.""  ""Let's support the shit out of this,"" said reddit user elux. ""Make them regret not doing this sooner. Let's reward them for having the courage, and also the wisdom, to come around. Gentlemen. Ladies. Ready them wallets.""  One more note: despite the EFF taking pains to ""not endorse"" Bitcoin, the organization's senior staff technologist, Seth Schoen, and activism director Rainey Reitman, do plan to be in attendance at the Bitcoin 2013 conference, which kicks off today in San Jose.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | MINING | REGULATION,Shirley Siluk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/17/electronic-frontier-foundation-accepts-bitcoins-again,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/864e90b92fb47e8bfc20e2d59c8e0fe6a1fd54b5-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Eliantie  announced in a press release today that staff members will receive their vacation pay in bitcoins, the news site NU reported.  The company has reportedly been mining bitcoins since 2010, and has now amassed enough of the digital currency to begin using it for holiday pay.  Eliantie employees were initially reluctant to accept bitcoins, reported the Dutch-language publication Automation Guide. Following several informational meetings, however, ""they are almost all convinced of the benefits,"" it reported (in a translation by Google Translate).  According to ExpatArrivals, workers in the Netherlands receive two bonus payments on top of their regular salary every year: a Christmas bonus and a summer bonus that is paid in May/June.

42376466,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX6Ai4L,1368803392,Building a brain the size of a planet: The CoinDesk Weekly Review,"Welcome to the CoinDesk Weekly Review — a regular look at the hottest, most controversial and thought-provoking events in the world of digital currency through the eyes of skepticism and wonder. Your host … John Law.  The week kicked off with the news that bitcoin fever had created the world's most powerful computer. The rate at which the world's miners were converting computer cycles to coinage was some four to eight times faster than the finest supercomputers money can buy.  And the rate is going up, with the massed ranks of laptops and servers being joined by an ever-increasing (when actually delivered) cadre of dedicated hardware on offer for the truly dedicated.  You’d think that such feats of digital prowess would be cause for celebration. But no; the tinkle of newly minted bitcoins was drowned out by the hand-wringing of the commentariat.  O tempora! O mores! they cried. If only such ingenuity could be put to good use curing cancer or global warming or working out where all the real money's gone, cried the press, which, John Law thinks, is missing the point.  Mining - the old fashioned sort of muscle, muck and mass mortality - has a long history of catalysing change far beyond the business of pulling out rocks. Bronze age tin mines created the first long-distance trade routes across Europe. In the Industrial Revolution, the problem of pumping out water from deep shafts provoked the invention of the first steam engines. And the next stage of space exploration is expected to involve mining asteroids. It’s all very well to boldly go, but it’s more sustainable to boldly come back again clutching booty.  As it is with digital coinage. The exciting part isn’t that you may become rich - although it’s not to be sniffed at. It’s that as so many people try, the spin-offs will change the world, like it or not.  So don't weep for the lost exaflops. Wait for them to turn into railways.  A dwolla short  To read some commentators you'd think the Fed's clamp-down on the Mt Gox-Dwolla fund transfer system was a direct assault on Bitcoin, and the muscular assertion of the regulator's fiat upon all crytocurrencies.  Which it wasn't. John Law would like to think it was more an entirely justified, if rather butch, official critique on the silly names that seem to attach themselves to any new technology. Mt. Gox, after all, stands for Magic The Gathering Online eXchange (it was a fantasy card collecting game, m'lud), and Dwolla sounds like a name a three-year-old would give to a favourite Barbie.  The real reason, much more prosaically, is that Mt. Gox and Dwolla lacked the requisite paperwork for offering money transfer services across borders. You can see such licenses as essential regulatory measures to protect individuals and companies from crime, or as a gangster racket aimed at preserving the state monopoly on taxation, according to preference: like a quantum particle, what it looks like depends on how you look at it.  But it is necessary. Much as the libertarian side of bitcoin philosophy casts the state as an evil, controlling force that grinds down any threat, most of the rest of us are rather happy that if we want to move money around there’s someone with more heft than us is prepared to step in if things go wrong. The balance of power and responsibility can go wrong, of course, and it’s at times like this that it’s entirely proper to question and test the limits of the system. But the system itself, while it might be as annoying as a traffic cop that gives us a ticket for doing 45 in a 40 zone, also means there are roads there in the first place and, should you get rear-ended by a joyrider, you’ll get your car fixed and the miscreant persuaded of the error of their ways.  And besides, the digital currency movement needs to learn about operating in the regulatory environment if it’s to have a serious chance of kicking off a revolution that works. Engineering the lawmakers is going to be just as important - and tricky - as getting the hash sums right.  Real value can be more dull than shiny  Spring in the United Kingdom has been what meteorologists officially describe as ‘rubbish’, with wind, rain and misery pushing the end of winter nearly three weeks past its defrost-by date. Now that a bit of sunny warmth is finally -- if fitfully -- caressing the land, every green plant in the place seems determined to pack in a month’s worth of growth and flowering over a weekend. The horse chestnut outside John Law’s secret HQ has gone from chilly skeleton to flowery full dress uniform overnight.  And so it is with the cryptocurrency community, where the realisation that there may finally be money in them thair bits has provoked a digital spring rush of product and promises not seen since the first Windows web browsers simple enough to be operated by bankers sparked the original Internet madness. Only time will filter out the successful inventors from the fanciful chancers, but some definitely indicate healthy growth.  One such is Bits Of Proof, announced on Friday. It’s not flashy or fancy, and makes no claims to create Scrooge McDuck bathfuls of glittering wealth, so is all the more interesting. An open-source reimplementation of the basic bitcoin protocols, it purports to be an enterprise-class, flexible, checkable version that is suitable for companies to employ with the same expectations as they have of an email server, a security system or a database. The company behind it expects to make its money through support and providing guaranteed services based on the software, but you or your company are free to take on all that yourself if you want.  It’s a classic open-source business play, a model that’s proven itself over the past twenty years. And like all such offerings, it’ll take a while for people to convince themselves that it works, is reliable and is useful. If it is, it’ll become part of the scenery.  But its importance right now is as a demonstrator of one of the primary attributes of the Internet - that once an idea is open and available to all, it cannot be un-invented. Even if everyone involved with Bits Of Proof vanished off the planet tomorrow and its website converted to kittens, the code is out there and living on uncountable computers. Any copy can be taken, modified, redistributed and run in the time it takes to type the commands.  This is a resilience that cannot be matched any other way. If Microsoft decided to shut up shop tomorrow, nuke its own servers and go to the beach forever, there’s no way Windows could continue as a going concern. Your iPhone without Apple would quickly become a pretty paperweight. But Bitcoin - or any other cryptocurrency based on open source and standards - cannot be killed like that, and every example of basic infrastructure like Bits Of Proof underlines that.  Nobody can predict tomorrow’s harvest, especially during the first, heady rush of a long-delayed season. But you can look at the basics behind the digital biology; concentrating on the fundamental drivers that make everything possible. Remember that as the waves of hype crash against the sea-cliffs of reality, and you won’t go far wrong.  John Law is an 18th century Scottish entrepreneur, financial engineer and gambler.

Gliph's mobile apps for iPhones and Google phones allow users to exchange secure text messages which are encrypted and can be permanently deleted. The latest version will also let you send Bitcoin payments.  The company said staff had become fascinated by the alternative currency in recent months. But they found aspects of it difficult or irritating to use.  Setting up a wallet was not simple and existing solutions were not easy enough to use. Staff found sending Bitcoins involved cutting and pasting long number strings into tiny text boxes.  They also found that discussing Bitcoin transactions via email or text could potentially endanger the very anonymity the currency can provide.  Gliph said:    1. We are making it extremely easy to send Bitcoin with other Gliph users.      2. We are providing a secure environment to discuss transactions that end in Bitcoin payments.    3.

42424893,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuFh,1368784818,10 things you need to know about Ripple,"1. What is Ripple?  Ripple  is the name for both a digital currency (XRP) and an open payment network within which that currency is transferred. It is a distributed, open-source payments system that’s still in beta. The goal of the ripple system, according to its website, is to enable people to break free of the “walled gardens” of financial networks – ie, credit cards, banks, PayPal and other institutions that restrict access with fees, charges for currency exchanges and processing delays.  2. What does Ripple do?  According to is OpenCoin, the company behind ripple, the currency addresses the need to keep money flowing freely. A company blog post titled “Ripple and the Purpose of Money” gives a brief history of money and its transportability, and points to the frustration of having banks and other institutions impede the transfer of funds with transaction fees and processing delays. The goal of Ripple, it says, is to build on the decentralized digital currency approach set by bitcoin and do “for money what the internet did for all other forms of information.”  3. How would Ripple function like the internet?  Ripple’s chief cryptographer, David Schwartz, explains it like this:  “Payment systems today are where email was in the early ‘80s. Every provider built their own system for their customers and if people used different systems they couldn’t easily interact with each other. Ripple is designed to connect different payment systems together.”  Schwartz also anticipates the possibility of seeing “big companies lose their control over the flow of other people’s money just as they’ve lost control over the flow of information.”  4. Who’s behind Ripple?  The company building the Ripple protocol, OpenCoin, was co-founded by CEO Chris Larsen and CTO Jed McCaleb. McCaleb is well-grounded in digital currency, coming from Mt. Gox, which currently handles the majority of the world’s bitcoin trades. Larsen previously co-founded and led the online financial company E-LOAN. Other developers on Ripple’s team also have a bitcoin background.  OpenCoin recently picked up a round of funding  from Andreessen Horowitz, FF Angel IV, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Vast Ventures and the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.  (Note: OpenCoin is not to be confused with OpenCoin.org, which is developing an open-source version of an electronic cash system developed by David Chaum.)  5. Is Ripple like Bitcoin?  In many ways, yes. Like Bitcoin, Ripple’s XRP unit is a digital form of currency based on mathematical formulae and has a limited number of units that can ultimately be mined. Both forms of currency can be transferred from account to account (peer-to-peer, or P2P) without the need for any intervening third party. And both provide digital security to guard against the possibility of counterfeit coins.  6. Does that mean Ripple is a Bitcoin rival?  Ripple positions itself as a complement to, rather than a competitor with, Bitcoin. In fact, the site has a page dedicated to Ripple for bitcoinershttps://ripple.com/bitcoiners/.  The Ripple network is designed to allow the seamless transfer of any form of currency, whether dollars, euros, pounds, yen or bitcoins.  “Ripple will open up many more gateways for bitcoin users and easier ways to bridge bitcoin with the mainstream world of finance,” says Stephen Thomas, a senior developer for the ripple protocol and a bitcoin advocate.  7. How would Ripple benefit bitcoin users?  In addition to giving Bitcoin more ways to connect with those using other forms of currency, Ripple promises expedited transactions and increased stability. As a distributed network, Ripple does not depend on a single company to manage and secure the transaction database. Consequently, there is no waiting on block confirmations, and transaction confirmations can go through the network quickly.  Another advantage of using peer-to-peer is the absence of a “central target or point of failure in the system,” Ripple’s backers note.  8. How many Ripples will there be?  The company plans to ultimately create 100 billion rippleshttps://ripple.com/wiki/Introduction_to_Ripple_for_Bitcoiners. Half of those are to be released for circulation, while the company plans to retain the other half.  9. Why is Ripple described as “free(ish)” rather than free?  Ripple doesn’t collect transaction fees the way PayPal, banks and credit cards do. However, it does take “a small portion of a ripple (equivalent to ~1/1000th of a cent)” from each transaction. That amount is destroyed rather than retained. The deduction is meant as to safeguard against the system being swamped by any one individual who might try to put through millions of transactions at once.  10. How much is a Ripple worth?  According to Bitcoin Charts, ripples were trading at around 115 per $1 (US) on May 17, 2013. (In early April, the price was about 1,000 per $1, so the currency has appreciated.)",NEUTRAL,XRP,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | TRADING | XRP,Ariella Brown,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2013/05/17/10-things-you-need-to-know-about-ripple,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fd8abafadc2d493099b68415fa66923dbc0daf5a-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Organized by the Bitcoin Foundation, Bitcoin 2013 will cover most aspects of the currency experiment, with sessions focused on how businesses can accept bitcoins, entrepreneurship in the space, and dealing with regulatory compliance. The US Department of Homeland Security's seizure of Mt. Gox funds from a Dwolla account this week is sure to be a hot topic during the panel on that last topic.  ""We hope to foster our mission of standardizing, promoting and protecting Bitcoin,"" said Bitcoin Foundation assistant director Lindsay Holland in an email to CoinDesk. The foundation expects the show to be an annual event.  Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss are set to kick off the event with a Friday night keynote address. The identical twins, known collectively as the Winklevii, reportedly own one of the largest single bitcoin stashes. Before they started buying bitcoins, they were known for accusing Mark Zuckerberg in court of stealing the idea for Facebook from a social network they started at Harvard -- with Zuck as one of their employees. The Winklevii received a settlement now worth about $220 million, according to the New York Times. It appears that they've sunk a chunk of their settlement into bitcoin.  Other stand-out speakers will include Bitcoin Foundation chief scientist Gavin Andresen, who will give a ""State of the Union"" overview of Bitcoin; BitPay co-founder and CEO Tony Gallippi, who will discuss how to drive businesses to use bitcoins; investor Roger Ver, who will help business owners learn how to use bitcoins; and Charlie Shrem, co-founder and CEO of BitInstant, who will discuss cash deposits.  Attendees can hear from businesspeople in the trenches -- including a doctor -- who accept bitcoins. And the libertarian element of the community will be represented with presentations by speakers such as medical marijuana activist Steve Kubby and Seasteading Institute ambassador Lasse Birk Olesen.  For would-be bitcoin entrepreneurs, there will be a hackathon where teams can pitch Draper Associates, Benchmark Capital and other venture capitalists before settling in for an all-night work session on projects to be judged Sunday.  The exhibition hall will feature booths for Coinbase, OpenCoin, CoinLab and other companies and organizations in the space. RoboCoin says it will unveil its bitcoin kiosk, where users can use cash to buy bitcoins or convert bitcoins into fiat currency. If you prefer the human touch, you can buy your coins at the expo's Bitcoin store. And a Bitcoin Help Desk will have experts on hand -- including Ver -- to answer attendees' questions.  Attendees can even watch a trailer for the unreleased documentary The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.  One name pointedly not included on the speaker or exhibitor lists: Satoshi Nakamoto. Will the mysterious inventor or inventors of Bitcoin be at the show? No one knows -- or, for that matter, would be likely to know -- even if they found themselves sharing a lunch table with Nakamoto himself. Or herself. Or themselves.

42424887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWu5h,1368778189,Bits of Proof launches 'Red Hat for Bitcoin',"A Hungarian company is about to launch an enterprise-class software product designed to make it easy for businesses to create bitcoin-enabled applications.  Bits of Proof  (BOP) calls the open-source software, ""Red Hat for Bitcoin.""  The BOP Enterprise Bitcoin Server is a redone version of the core software originally designed by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto that communicates with other computers on the Bitcoin network. Bits of Proof founder Tamas Blummer has reworked the algorithm using his own code, creating an entirely new version of the software. He then developed a messaging system allowing third-party software to communicate with it using standard web and mobile device protocols.  The result, Blummer says, is a high-performance, scalable Bitcoin node that enterprise developers don't have to tinker with. It offers virtually zero setup time and hassle, he claims. Instead, developers can concentrate on quickly rolling out their Bitcoin applications and services.  The software, which uses the Java programming framework, uses multi-threaded transaction validation. This means that its performance scales with the number of processors available on the hardware used.  ""Satoshi is a genius, but his implementation of the protocol is hard to maintain and extend,"" Blummer wrote in November, when he first made the code available for community review. ""I believe that peers will specialize and this implementation is suited for the big server, tailored for some heavy lifting tasks, not for a mobile.""
