42433529,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzBxh,1612825857,"Bitcoin Tops $47K After Tearing Through $45K, $46K in Tesla-Fueled Rise","In a run reminiscent of bitcoin's stunning ascent in early January, the price of leading cryptocurrency blew past $45,000, $46,000 and $47,000 in less than an hour on Monday evening, driven by Tesla's announcement that it had bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin.    Bitcoin (BTC) hit $47,513.57, a new all-time high, before settling back to $47,053.09, up 20.6% in the last 24 hours.  $45,000 was supposed to have been a milestone of sorts but the cryptocurrency's race upwards turned it into an afterthought. The cryptocurrency has risen about 67% year to date.  A combination of traders in Asia just waking up to the Tesla (TSLA) news combined with a lack of resistance levels above $45,000 were possible causes for the sudden gap upwards.  While those might be the immediate catalysts for the sudden surge in the cryptocurrency, they're not the only reasons for bitcoin's stunning rise.  A growing number of big institutional investors including Paul Tudor Jones II and Bill Miller have pushed into bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, as the U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks around the world pump trillions of dollars of freshly created money into financial markets to stimulate their coronavirus-racked economies.  Tesla joins publicly traded companies including Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy that have steered corporate money into bitcoin. And from the price of bitcoin today, it's clear some investors think it's just getting started.  “We think this is just the start to a much wider adoption from household institutional names, finally ready to make the crossover into the crypto space,” Joel Kruger, strategist at the cryptocurrency exchange LMAX Digital, said in an email.  As more institutional investors like Tesla are buying bitcoin and ""hodl"" it for the long term, bitcoin’s liquid supply is continuing to decline, according to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode’s newsletter on Monday.  “Currently, around 78% of issued bitcoin are either lost or being hodled,” the newsletter said. “This leaves less than 4 million bitcoin to be shared among future market entrants - including large institutional investors such as PayPal, Square,  Bitcoin’s latest rally also pushed prices for other major cryptocurrencies including ether, algorand, and litecoin, according to CoinDesk 20.  “Mainstream adoption [for crypto] is happening right before our eyes, and it is taking place before the entire world,” Mati Greenspan, founder and CEO of Quantum Economics, wrote in his newsletter on Monday.  With this latest surge, the market value of bitcoin ($860.4 billion) has once again passed that of Tesla ($818.4 billion) after topping it for the first time ever earlier Monday.

42433543,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzCJh,1612819752,Market Wrap: The 'Elon Effect' Blasts Bitcoin to $44.8K While Ether Moons,"Bitcoin’s price is getting closer to Mars thanks to Elon Musk while ether moons to a new record. Investors are pulling BTC out of DeFi, likely to diversify their profits.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $44,023 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 14.5% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $38,051-$44,801 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC well above the 10-hour and the 50-hour moving average on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin’s price hit a record-high price Monday, soaring to $44,801 at around 13:00 UTC (8 a.m. ET). It’s one month to the day since hitting the previous record of $41,375, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      One catalyst for the price run-up: Entrepreneur Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) plowed $1.5 billion into the cryptocurrency. The company also said it would accept bitcoin for goods and services rendered.      Read More: Tesla Invests $1.5B in Bitcoin, Plans to Accept Crypto Payments      “All bets are off the table now. I was worried that [at] around $35,000-$40,000 we were not seeing a huge amount of institutional flows, and over the weekend the market moved higher in a fairly weak fashion,” noted Chris Thomas, head of digital assets for. Swissquote Bank. “But Tesla would have bought over the last few weeks, a little every day.”      Since the start of 2021, bitcoin spot exchange volumes by eight major exchanges tracked by the CoinDesk 20 have been higher than its six-month average.      This year so far, average trading on these exchanges has been $4.4 billion per day; going back to Aug. 8, 2020, the daily average has been $1.7 billion. As of press time Monday, volume is also higher than that 2021 average, at over $6.7 billion.      “Bitcoin is at new highs today in ‘frenzied’ buying, clearing minor resistance from January,” said Katie Stockton, a technical analyst at Fairlead Strategies. Stockton also noted bitcoin has lost steam since its Musk-motivated rally, at $44,023 as of press time. “Signs of exhaustion are associated with today’s steep rally from an overbought/oversold perspective,” she said.      However, the trend remains bullish, Stockton added. “Despite the potential for additional short-term volatility, the long-term uptrend appears healthy behind bitcoin from a momentum perspective.“      While some may be skittish about bitcoin’s rise in 30-day volatility over the past three months, other types of traders are certainly enthusiastic about it.      “Tesla buying bitcoin was a mostly predictable move, given the vocal support it has seen from CEO Elon Musk,” said Guy Hirsch, U.S. managing director at eToro.      Read More: Ex-OCC Chief Brooks Calls Tesla’s Bitcoin Buy a Bit ‘Scary’ for Rest of World      “If more companies begin making similar announcements, $50,000 could potentially be within reach during the next few months,” Hirsch added.      “We think we're only just scratching the surface when it comes to corporate and institutional participation in the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies,” Joel Kruger, cryptocurrency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. “We suspect that moves from visionaries like Tesla will only serve to reinforce the tremendous value proposition that decentralized assets have to offer.”    Ether at new high as BTC investors pull out of Ethereum protocol    Meanwhile, ether (ETH) is also hitting records and the asset’s correlation with bitcoin has cropped back up to levels not seen since December.      The second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was up Monday trading around $1,720 and climbing 8.5% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET). The price hit a fresh all-time high Monday, hitting $1,776, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      Read More: Ethereum Futures Are Now Trading on CME      The amount of bitcoin held in Ethereum-based decentralized finance, or DeFi, has dropped almost 3.5% Monday, going from over 50,000 to 48,344 BTC as of press time, according to data aggregator DeFi Pulse.      Swissquote’s Thomas notes that Monday may be a day for larger players to start moving some bitcoin around because a fresh bitcoin price high might induce some investors to diversify their profits.      “Larger hedge funds, etc., [that] had got into bitcoin between $15,000-$20,000 would naturally want to take profits around $45,000-$50,000"" for a profit of 2.5-3x. ""I’ve always viewed that as a hard challenge,” Thomas told CoinDesk.    Other markets    Digital assets on the CoinDesk 20 are all in the green Monday.

42433538,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzCDh,1612818688,Wall Street Shifts Focus From Blockchain Infrastructure to Crypto Assets,"News that Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and Citi are considering entering the crypto custody market likely surprised many who haven’t followed the blockchain tech or digital asset moves of major U.S. financial institutions over the last half-decade. However, analysis based on publicly available blockchain initiatives data clearly shows that many institutions – some more than others – are slowly de-prioritizing blockchain tech and shifting their focus to native crypto assets.      To assess how institutions are adapting to blockchain technology, we surveyed their initiative announcements. We looked at credible media, such as CoinDesk and the Financial Times, and defined an initiative as a reported “investment, internal or external-facing company project, or consortium participation event primarily involving the company.”    Guido Molinari is the managing partner at Prysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies. He is a member of the Economic Advisory Committee at the Algorand Foundation.    We can see a clear shift. In 2015 and 2016, financial institutions tended to have a technology-first focused strategy. They were founding members of consortia like R3 and the development of the Corda protocol. More recently, as you can see in our matrix, leaders in the space have shifted away from this earlier positioning to focus their efforts more towards digital assets (at least in terms of the number of total initiatives).      The shifting focus is marked. Up until 2018, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) dominated the hype pushed by major consortia formations, which also came at the time where blockchain-without-crypto startups raised financing in the tens of millions of dollars from major financial institutions. The landscape has since changed significantly.      Goldman Sachs exemplifies the change. Whether through investments, exploring the launch of its own digital token or the previously mentioned entry into custody, the bank has shifted from technology to a balanced and diverse approach across technology and assets, which, per our graph, place them in the lead, ahead of the rest of the market.      See also: Guido Molinari - Enterprise Blockchain Is at a Private-Public Crossroads      JPMorgan, which for years had led a strong technology-first approach with its development of Quorum and its long-held bearish public voice on digital assets, has begun to reverse course. From 2018 to 2020 on the graph above, we can see JPM trending upwards to become more asset-focused. In part, this has been driven by JPM divesting itself of Quorum to ConsenSys and a change of tone in its position on bitcoin.      In 2020, Fidelity saw a great acceleration of its asset-focused strategy launching an “incredibly successful” bitcoin custody business and continuing to invest in various crypto-related startups. Its competitors, such as Schwab, are also entering the market and taking positions in crypto mining stocks. Meanwhile, the largest asset manager of them all, BlackRock, recently signaled that it will soon be “getting into the bitcoin game.”      Looking at the middle of the lower-left quadrant, we see that in 2016 Citi took an early lead, participating in more initiatives than any other major U.S. financial institution. This continued into 2018 as Citi added more initiatives and moved horizontally to the right on the graph while remaining focused on technology.      However, perhaps due to limited success in those initiatives, the bank has slowed its earlier blockchain and crypto exploration. Since 2018, apart from a digital asset initiative related to central bank digital currencies (CBDC), it has been associated with few new development in the institutional space.      Other financial institutions such as Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Wells Fargo are clear followers, lagging in the shift from technology-centric to assets-centric. Morgan Stanley’s recent announcement that it has boosted its stake in MicroStrategy may be an early indication these firms are starting to catch on to the ways of their competition.      Towards the lower-right quadrant of this graph, this shift has hit the industry like a tsunami. As we have written before, this is far from an isolated phenomenon.      See also: Michael Casey - Money Reimagined: Enterprise Blockchain Isn’t Dead      Enterprise efforts focused on the underlying technology of blockchain have, by and large, fallen short of expectations. Having said that, there are still firms at various levels of progress that remain staunchly focused on the technology side of the industry. R3, which was previously in a precarious situation, saw a major boost in its financial standing from the Ripple settlement. Digital Assets raised $150 million, but prominent executives departed and general doubts have been raised about its initiatives. Axoni has been the one getting the most initial traction.    Enterprise efforts focused on the underlying technology of blockchain have, by and large, fallen short of expectations.    Recent developments among major financial institution-driven consortia are further evidence that technology-first plays are fading. Over the last 12 months, few have announced additional members. Türk Reasürans joined B3i, but the leading insurance blockchain network still counts just 21 shareholders with only five of the top 25 insurers and just seven of the top 50 reinsurers.      Even Fnality, the leading network of distributed financial market infrastructures, hasn’t announced a new member since September 2019. The largest global blockchain network convener, IBM, has found limited success in the financial services space and, at times, its initiatives have been found to not even require blockchain at all.      What have banking executives said publicly in recent months relating to blockchain consortia or DLT? Hardly anything. On the assets side, however, we have very promising signals such as Goldman’s new head of Digital Assets who envisions “a future in which all of the world’s financial assets reside on electronic ledgers.”      See also: IBM Blockchain Is a Shell of Its Former Self After Revenue Misses, Job Cuts: Sources      Financial institutions may demonstrate to the enterprise world that perhaps blockchain’s greatest value is not in the underlying technology but its native digital assets. Initiatives that find the right mix are challenging to implement, but we believe this exploration may be justified by its high potential reward.      As we have written in the past, enterprise blockchain plays have failed mostly due to challenges related to economic incentives. Given that, it may be time for financial institutions to leave the technology-first approach aside. Instead, future initiatives should focus on identifying the economic value at play, whether that's in digitizing existing financial assets or existing digital assets such as stablecoins. Those who think asset-first will chart the course towards the fast-approaching native digital economy.

42433531,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzC3h,1612813491,Caveat Depositor. How Safe Is Your Stablecoin?,"We often talk about central banks creating fiat money. In fact, most fiat money is not created by central banks but by commercial banks. Furthermore, not all of the banks that create and hold fiat money are regulated banks. Many are what we know as “shadow banks.” In the cryptocurrency network, there is a whole shadow banking industry creating and holding fiat money, or something that looks very much like it.      Shadow banks are financial institutions that do bank-like things but aren’t subject to banking regulations. They include investment banks, non-bank lenders, money market funds, private equity and hedge funds, and insurance companies. They also include special purpose vehicles (SPVs), which are subsidiary companies created by regulated banks to enable them to do unregulated things. And they include banks headquartered outside the U.S., notably those in offshore jurisdictions.    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing,” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    The “shadow dollars” created and held by shadow banks are known as eurodollars. “Euro” here doesn’t refer to the euro currency and doesn’t have much to do with Europe. Eurodollars nowadays tend to live in places like the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas.      Because eurodollars are held outside the U.S. regulated banking system, they do not have FDIC insurance and the institutions in which they are held have no backing from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Really, they are “faux dollars.”      To their users, however, eurodollars are indistinguishable from real dollars created by the Fed and U.S. regulated banks. And when eurodollars flow from the shadow banking system into the regulated system, they become real dollars. Conversely, dollars created by the Fed and regulated U.S. banks become eurodollars when they are sent to offshore or foreign locations. The system works as long as the 1:1 implied exchange rate between eurodollars and real dollars holds. But when the peg fails, there is chaos.      See also: Questions About Tether Just Won’t Go Away. Does the Crypto Market Care?      Tether’s bank, Deltec, is part of the shadow banking network. It is located in the Bahamas, an offshore jurisdiction beyond the reach of U.S. regulation, and it holds U.S. dollar deposits. Deltec Bank is not backed by the Federal Reserve, and the U.S. dollars it holds have no FDIC insurance. So Tether’s deposits in Deltec Bank, including the cash reserves that Tether says back USDT tokens, are eurodollar deposits.      Deltec Bank might hold cash reserves in one or more U.S. regulated banks. But these reserves may not be sufficient to back all of its eurodollar deposits. And even if they are, dollars in regulated bank deposit accounts are not “in custody.” They are loaned to the bank and only insured up to the FDIC limit of $250,000 per customer per institution. Anyway, FDIC insurance only applies to deposits in regulated banks, not to deposits in offshore shadow banks, even if those shadow banks are customers of the regulated banks. If Deltec Bank failed, there would be no FDIC insurance for its depositors. Tether’s guarantee that 1 USDT = 1 USD therefore entirely depends on Deltec Bank remaining solvent.      See also: Pascal Hügli - Hyper-Stablecoinization: From Eurodollars to Crypto-Dollars      It’s not just Tether that relies on shadow banks. In a recent interview, Tether’s chief technical officer, Paolo Ardoino, said that not only Tether itself but the cryptocurrency exchanges that are its principal customers have U.S. dollar accounts at Deltec Bank.      Some of these exchanges might use Deltec Bank as their settlement bank. But others might simply have accounts at Deltec to make paying for Tethers more convenient. Instead of wiring U.S. dollars to Deltec Bank every time they need to top up their tethers, they can simply fund their Deltec account whenever it suits them and use the balance to pay for more tethers. But whichever approach they use, the money they keep on deposit at Deltec Bank is not FDIC insured and not backed by the Fed. And if their own settlement banks are also shadow banks, then any money they have with those is not FDIC insured or Fed-backed either.    The collapse of the money market fund Reserve Primary ... shows how disastrous the breaking of an implied exchange rate peg like this can be.    Not only do Tether and its crypto exchange customers rely on the fiat shadow banking network, they are themselves part of it. And other stablecoin issuers are, too. Just as Tether guarantees that 1 USDT = 1 USD, other stablecoin issuers similarly guarantee that their coins are equivalent to U.S. dollars. They even call them U.S. dollars: USDT means “USD tether,” USDC means “USD coin,” and so on. But stablecoins are, with few exceptions, created by unregulated financial institutions that have no FDIC insurance and no Fed backing. Really, stablecoins are “faux dollars.”      See also: Frances Coppola - The Stablecoin Surge Is Built on Smoke and Mirrors      Whether stablecoins like USDT and USDC can be exchanged 1:1 for U.S. dollars depends entirely on the existence of adequate U.S. dollar reserves and on the solvency of the banks that hold those reserves. If there aren’t enough actual dollars to pay all those who want to withdraw their funds, the 1:1 exchange rate peg will break and coin holders won’t be able to get all of their money back.      The collapse of the money market fund Reserve Primary during the 2008 financial crisis shows how disastrous the breaking of an implied exchange rate peg like this can be. Investors in a money market fund pay dollars in return for shares in the fund. Until 2008, money market funds marketed themselves as high-interest versions of insured U.S. bank deposits. There was a widespread belief that shareholders would always be able withdraw what they put in, that no fund would “break the buck.” So, 1 share = 1 USD. Sounds rather similar to a stablecoin, doesn’t it?      Reserve Primary MMF didn’t have 100% cash reserves backing its shares. It had invested in commercial paper issued by, among others, the shadow bank Lehman Brothers. When Lehman Brothers failed in September 2008, the value of its commercial paper crashed to zero and Reserve Primary MMF could no longer guarantee the 1:1 peg. It announced to its shareholders that it could only return 97 cents for every dollar they had invested.      Reserve Primary MMF’s announcement, hard on the heels of the failure of Lehman Brothers and the collapse of the insurance company AIG, sent shockwaves through the financial system. Massive amounts of money ran from the shadow banking network into regulated banks and U.S. Treasurys. To stop the run, the Fed bailed out the shadow banking network, reinstating the broken peg and restoring confidence in eurodollars.      See also: JP Koning - What Tether Means When It Says It’s ‘Regulated’      Like Reserve Primary MMF’s shareholders, cryptocurrency traders treat stablecoins as simply a variety of U.S. dollar. Of course, traders know the exchange rate is not guaranteed, and not all stablecoin issuers have 100% cash reserves. But, hey, the Fed bailed out shadow banks before, didn’t it? Why wouldn’t it bail out stablecoins?      Unfortunately for crypto traders, stablecoins and their banks are nowhere near as dangerous to the global financial system as Lehman Brothers, AIG, Reserve Primary MMF and the rest of the shadow banks that crashed in 2008. If Tether goes down, the crypto market will be seriously disrupted, but the rest of the world will hardly notice. And few people are going to lose any sleep over a small Bahamian bank failing.      Neither the Fed nor the FDIC has any reason to ensure crypto traders can get their U.S. dollars out of the stablecoins and exchanges in which they have deposited them. The credibility of the promises made by crypto shadow banks thus depends entirely on the adequacy of their reserves. Sadly, this seems to be enormously variable. So “caveat depositor,” we might say.

That’s due to the recent rally in decentralized finance (DeFi) and the increased cost of using the Ethereum blockchain.      According to data from analytics site Messari, cardano’s market cap stands at approximately $21.82 billion while and polkadot’s is at roughly $19.83 billion. For XRP, that figure is about $16.36 billion.      The latest rally of the two cryptocurrencies of these public blockchains is not “idiosyncratic pumps,” according to investors and analysts who spoke to CoinDesk, but is a bet on these public blockchains’ “Ethereum-killer” narrative. Investors and traders are increasingly viewing Ethereum’s blockchain as too expensive and difficult to use while decentralized finance (DeFi), usually built on Ethereum, continues to boom.      Data from blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shows when ether’s price jumped after the CME launched its ether futures contract on Sunday, the Ethereum blockchain’s transaction fees started climbing again. On a 24-hour moving average, the network’s total transaction fees, as of 14:00 UTC (9 a.m. ET) Monday, Feb. 8, was at $1,003,727.15.      “[Ethereum] is seemingly too clogged,” Mable Jiang, a principal at crypto investment firm Multicoin Capital. “[Cardano and Polkadot] fit into the larger narrative of ‘seeking for a scalable blockchain,’ so if the capital within the crypto capital market is looking for some latest narrative to shill, this is it.”      Jiang's Multicoin Capital, a Austin, Texas-based crypto fund, has invested in many so-called ""Ethereum Killers,"" including Solana and Algorand.      Read More: High Gas Fees Prevent Ethereum From Being Ethereum      Helping to drive the latest ether rally is the explosive DeFi sector; approximately $36.13 billion is locked in DeFi at the moment, per DeFI Pulse data. The majority of top DeFi protocols by market capitalization are based on Ethereum including Aave, Uniswap, Maker, Synthetix and Compound.      Using the Ethereum network has become more expensive, and it’s not just because of DeFi. According to Jiang, another factor is bitcoin’s latest rally to a new all-time high earlier Monday after U.S. electric car manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) announced its purchase of $1.5 billion of bitcoin.      “Right now, there's such a big rally because of Tesla's disclosure, and if people are going to close their short position on ether, they'd pay $50-$100 [worth of] gas [fee] per transaction probably,” Jiang said. “This is no longer affordable [for] any small-size retailers"" using decentralized derivatives platforms.      In the hour leading up to press time, the average gas price was 307 gwei, according to gas fee tracker gasnow.org, which is powered by Ethereum mining pool Sparkpool. “Gas” refers to the internal pricing unit for running transactions on Ethereum and is denoted in gwei, which is equal to one billionth of an ether.

42433525,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzBnh,1612808169,"Apple Should Launch Own Crypto Exchange, RBC Analyst Says","Apple (AAPL), the maker of hot-selling items from iPhones to tablets, is the world’s largest publicly traded company, with a market capitalization of $2.3 trillion.      So it almost seems natural that after the electric vehicle maker Tesla announced Monday a $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin, at least one Wall Street analyst is running the math on whether Apple might benefit from jumping into the cryptocurrency fray.      A new report from the brokerage firm RBC Capital Markets posits that Apple, which already provides payments wallets for millions of consumers in an economy that’s gone increasingly cashless since the coronavirus pandemic hit in early 2020, might be able to easily generate more than $40 billion from the cryptocurrency business. The company’s move could also help to make the U.S. a technological leader in cryptocurrencies for the next decade or two.      The RBC analyst, Mitch Steves, figures that the payments firm Square (SQ) generates about $1.6 billion per quarter in bitcoin-related revenue on an active install base estimated at around 30 million.      “Apple's install base is 1.5 billion, and even if we assume only 200 million users would transact, this is 6.66x larger than Square,” according to the report. “Therefore, the potential revenue opportunity would be in excess of $40 billion a year (15% incremental top-line opportunity).”      According to the report, the research and development cost involved in the effort “would be de minimis in our view as Square's entire R&D budget is under $1 billion.”      Competition in the crypto exchange space “is light,” the analysts wrote. Regulations make it difficult for U.S. consumers to purchase crypto, and many of the exchanges go down during times of high volume, they wrote.      Apple could solve the regulatory and know-your-customer (KYC) challenges of cryptocurrencies if it created a closed system in which it only transfers the ownership of crypto between customers, the analysts noted.      It could also develop an open system that uses a bitcoin wallet and banking service Strike or the Bitcoin blockchain’s Lighting Network to reduce the cost of converting fiat to crypto, they added.      Apple standing up a crypto exchange could also reduce the likelihood the U.S. bans bitcoin in the future, the analysts said.      “If Apple went down this path the U.S.A. would likely acquire the most crypto assets from a global perspective,” the analysts wrote. “If the U.S.A. owns the most crypto assets (be it bitcoin or other assets), it would not make logical sense in our view to ban it. In addition, with Apple’s secure and world-class software, the U.S.A. would be able to have confidence in user information and balances if needed in the future.”    Bitcoin on Apple’s balance sheet    There’s even a trick that Apple might pull to finance the project’s development: Bet money on bitcoin.      The analysts proposed that Apple pay for the cost of developing an Apple crypto wallet or exchange (around $500 million, per their estimates) by adding bitcoin to the tech giant’s balance sheet.      “For example, if the firm purchased $5 billion of bitcoin (20-25 days of cash flow), the price of the underlying asset would need to rise by 10% for the firm to fully fund the entire project in the first place,” the analysts wrote. “This is a solid value proposition in our view as the business would be funded without diluting any other projects at the firm.”      Read the full report:",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/08/apple-should-launch-own-crypto-exchange-rbc-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/936ed8ce4cd34b386e737140bf72e20557c8a8e3-1500x891.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433539,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzCFh,1612806339,"Blockchain Bites: Tesla Drives $1.5B Into Bitcoin, Brian Brooks Comments on Monetary Debasement","Three stories    1. Tesla invested $1.5 billion of its cash reserves in bitcoin, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission annual report. The popular auto manufacturer said bitcoin offers “more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash.” The company had more than $19 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2020.    Both Tesla's stock and bitcoin’s price jumped on the news. Bitcoin moved up approximately 11% to more than $43,000 (approximately the price of a Tesla Model 3), setting a new record high. Some cryptocurrency exchanges experienced “technical issues” amid the rally.  Tesla also announced it will accept bitcoin for purchases ""in the near future.""    Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and world’s richest man, is a late convert to bitcoin, having said recently, “I do at this point think bitcoin is a good thing.” He follows other corporate executives in embracing the hard-capped cryptocurrency amid an unprecedented period of a loose monetary policy during the coronavirus pandemic.    For instance, veteran hedge fund manager Bill Miller’s outfit may invest in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust through its flagship fund, the Miller Opportunity Trust. The fund is seeking indirect exposure to the crypto market by putting as much as 15% of its $2.25 billion into the regulated trust. (Grayscale is a CoinDesk sister company.)    2. Ether futures have launched on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), one of the world’s most active commodities exchanges. The opening price of a CME ether futures product was $1,669.75, about $70 over spot at the time.    Industry commenters believe this first regulated ETH futures product will increase demand for the cryptocurrency, and could have an appreciable impact on its price. Ether is the second-largest crypto by market capitalization.  “A futures product serves many purposes to many different types of investors and institutional traders,” CME's Director Tim McCourt said on CoinDesk TV. “The price movement we’ve seen is further reinforcing customer demand.”  CME was the first exchange to offer bitcoin futures, in December 2017, an event that preceded a year-long bear market, according to CoinDesk market reporter Omkar Godbole. Former U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Chris Giancarlo said the Trump administration approved these contracts in an effort to “pop” the bitcoin bubble.    3. Binance has temporarily suspended deposits in Nigerian naira – the country’s currency – in response to a Friday letter from Nigeria’s central bank instructing local banks to identify and close all accounts tied to cryptocurrency platforms or operations.    On Sunday, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a five-page statement saying its earlier action to curtail crypto use was merely a reiteration of a long-standing policy. CoinDesk’s Sandali Handagama reported the directive comes just months after protesters in Nigeria used bitcoin to raise funds after authorities reportedly shuttered their bank accounts.  India, too, is exploring a potential ban on cryptocurrencies. Despite fierce public opposition to a draft bill, the Indian government is now reportedly looking to fast-track the effort.  At stake    ""In retrospect, it was inevitable."" Perhaps to Elon Musk’s chagrin, the former acting head of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, Brian Brooks, thinks the latest corporate treasury to buy into bitcoin is a bigger story than just one maverick founder and an electric car manufacturer.      ""For people who are invested in bitcoin it's exciting news,"" said Brooks, who left the OCC last month. ""For people who are looking at the rest of the world it's actually a little bit scary news.""      Speaking on CoinDesk TV’s inaugural broadcast, the former regulator put the recent trend of U.S. corporations investing a portion of their cash holdings in bitcoin within an inflationary context.      “Bitcoin is a more stable source of value over the long haul, potentially,” Brooks said. He noted the U.S. money supply has risen 25% since the start of the pandemic and could be up 40% compared with a year ago if stimulus efforts go through.      “That's crazy, right?” Brooks said.      Tesla piling over $1 billion into bitcoin is a massive story. Given the Musk acolytes, those who believe the world’s richest man is ushering humanity into its next phase of techno-evolution, the auto company’s bitcoin buy could have a bigger effect on the “Overton window” than just Square and MicroStrategy.      It’s still an open question whether cash is really being debased. For years, fears of inflation have mostly missed the mark – as has the Federal Reserve’s target for a 2% inflation target.      Still, Brooks sees the value in cryptographically secured currencies like bitcoin. “My thesis is that there is a thing about decentralization, it is both a freer technology and it is also a more sound money strategy than central bank-governed money printing approaches, which is what we’ve done historically,” he said.      While this view may sound extreme, Brooks doesn’t think he’s alone among regulators. He noted that Michael Barr, who could take Brooks' former role at the banking regulator, shares a “similar thesis.” It’s not a partisan issue, either. There are those wielding power on both sides of the aisle who believe cryptocurrencies and blockchain could play a major role in the future of finance.      In short, for Brooks, it comes down to a divide between who is a “tech adopter,” or an innovator, and those who aren’t.      “Crypto and fintech and banking are all converging here, and blockchain is the infrastructure of the future. So we’ll all be talking about this for a long time to come I expect,” Brooks said.    Quick bites  Nic Carter responds to criticisms of Bitcoin’s energy consumption.

The integration means the Casper Network will be available to developers on BSN after its mainnet launch in the first quarter of 2021, according to the firm’s press statement, which was shared with CoinDesk.      The partnership is part of BSN’s efforts to become a global blockchain infrastructure services provider. The state-backed project aims to offer cloud services and a standardized development environment, where decentralized applications (dapp) developers across various blockchain networks can build or run their dapps on the same platform.      BSN was co-founded by Chinese state-owned telecom giant China Mobile, UnionPay and IT startup Red Date in April 2020. It has integrated some of the most popular blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Cosmos and Palkdot. BSN claimed its inclusive platform can help dapp developers reduce operational costs and improve flexibility with regulatory oversight.    Read more: China’s BSN Onboards EY for Ethereum Compliance Tools    ""Casper is the first fully decentralized, scalable and highly secure proof-of-stake blockchain,” Mrinal Manohar, CEO and co-founder of CasperLabs, said in the statement. “Via our close partnership with BSN, we look forward to helping promote the continued adoption of this important public technology across global markets.""      As one of many possible Ethereum competitors, the Casper Network hopes to improve security without sacrificing the scalability as a PoS network. Advised by Ethereum Foundation’s researcher Vlad Zamfir, the Casper Network has raised $14.5 million via a Series A funding round in 2019 from investors such as Arrington XRP Capital and Hashkey Capital.      CasperLabs partnered with Singapore-based exchange BitMax to launch a token sale for retail investors in March 2020. The exchange predominantly offers trading services to traders in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Russia and India.      “We are confident in both the Red Date and CasperLabs teams to spearhead the adoption of the Casper network and blockchain technology in China,” Omer Ozden, Chairman of RockTree Capital, which invested in CasperLabs’ Series A round, said in the statement.

The exchange filed the suit against the century-old business publication in November alleging a story by reporter Michael del Castillo (formerly of CoinDesk) and contributor Jason Brett made false allegations. Binance sought to have Forbes pay damages and take down the article, but said in a Feb. 4, 2021, filing that it would voluntarily dismiss the case without prejudice (meaning it is free to bring another case on the same grounds later).      The new filing did not say why Binance withdrew the lawsuit for now. A judge approved the dismissal the same day.      At the heart of the suit was a story about the so-called “Tai Chi” document. The slide presentation obtained by Forbes allegedly described a plan to help Binance bypass U.S. regulations by using a U.S.-based entity to handle business in the country and send profits back to the parent firm. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, more commonly referred to as CZ, has repeatedly refused to answer questions about where his firm is currently headquartered.      “Binance does not violate, and fully complies with, all applicable laws, rules and regulations in its operations. Binance does not seek to evade or ‘side-step’ any regulatory entities in any jurisdictions in connection with their role in ensuring that all laws, rules and regulations of their jurisdictions are complied with,” the lawsuit said.      One of Binance’s lawyers in the case is Charles Harder, who published a press release when the suit was filed. Harder is perhaps best known for representing pro wrestler Hulk Hogan in his suit against the website Gawker, ultimately leading to that media organization’s bankruptcy.

""For people who are invested in bitcoin it's exciting news,"" said Brooks, who left the OCC last month. ""For people who are looking at the rest of the world it's actually a little bit [of] scary news.""  Brooks was responding, in part, to Tesla's announcement Monday it has invested $1.5 billion in bitcoin and would be looking to acquire more digital assets. That news sent the price of bitcoin to a new all-time high.  The former acting comptroller noted the U.S. money supply has risen 25% since the start of the pandemic and will be up 40% compared with a year ago once the most recent round of stimulus is done in the next few days.  ""That's crazy, right?"" Brooks asked. ""The way inflation works is the more of asset you have the less valuable it is. That would explain why a lot of institutions want to have bitcoin sitting in their treasury because it's a lot more stable source of value over the long haul, potentially.'  Brooks declined to say what his next career move will be, only he hopes to be in the space for a long time to come.

42433530,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOzBzh,1612797186,Bank of Korea: CBDCs Are Fiat Currency Not Virtual Assets,"The Bank of Korea (BOK) has published the results of research it conducted last year on the legal issues surrounding central bank digital currencies (CBDC).      The research concludes that a CBDC would meet the requirements of currency legislation and could be freely exchanged with cash as the two share the same legal status. Therefore it would be reasonable to treat a CBDC in the same way as cash deposits held by financial institutions, CoinDesk Korea reported Monday.      For this reason, it is proposed the BOK, South Korea's central bank, should have the legal basis for applying positive or negative interest rates on a future CBDC. It will also need to be decided whether the BOK would exchange the CBDC for cash with consumers directly or via an intermediary agency.      Considering how a CBDC would fit into South Korea’s existing legal framework, the research suggests it would not be subject to the Financial Transactions Act, as a CBDC issuance would be based on monetary authority and not for profit.      However, the research emphasizes the Bank of Korea Act would need to be amended to accommodate the issuance of a digital currency, because the act only accounts for notes and coins at present.      See also: S. Korea’s Central Bank Forms Legal Panel to Advise on Possible Digital Currency Launch      Comparison with virtual assets such as cryptocurrencies, according to the research, are difficult as a CBDC “has a clear issuer,"" the central bank, and is based on the exclusive power of that issuer. This differs from virtual assets which are described as digital certificates with economic value that can be traded or transferred electronically.      Therefore, as the CBDC would not be considered as property, the law would not be able to establish crime such as theft, embezzlement or stolen property.

42411941,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glhEHe,1612796230,Which Crypto Projects Are Based on Ethereum?,"According to the crypto app tracker, State of the Dapps, there are over 3,000 decentralized apps (also known as “dapps”) running on the Ethereum blockchain.  These apps differ from regular mobile and web-based apps because they aim to hand users more control over the data the apps manage. Traditional apps, such as Robinhood or Twitter, are managed by a central authority, which ultimately has the last word on how their customers’ data is secured and used – for better or worse.  Dapps take a decentralized approach to data management, theoretically putting control back in the hands of the user with the help of blockchain technology - the basis of the Ethereum network. Ethereum is the name of both the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization (after bitcoin) and the first platform to facilitate the creation of dapps.  While the promise of Ethereum is tantalizing to proponents of the technology, it’s an open-source platform, meaning the projects built upon it are often experimental and sometimes outright scams. Conducting diligent research before investing is highly recommended.  Top Ethereum projects  Right now, many of the top Ethereum projects are focused on decentralized finance, or DeFi. DeFi aims to expand the utility of cryptocurrencies from day-to-day transactions to more complex financial use cases, such as loans and derivatives.  The DeFi space gained significant traction in 2020, with the total value of crypto assets locked in its protocols rising over 2,000% from $650 million at the start of the year to $16.05 billion at the close.  Ethereum dapps have become so popular that the increased congestion has pushed transaction fees – the amount of ether required to send payments over the network – higher than ever. This is a direct result of dapp users competing to get their transactions processed faster by miners. The higher the fee attached to a transaction, the more likely an ETH miner will add that to the blockchain sooner.  MakerDao  Stablecoins are an effort to improve upon one of the pain points of cryptocurrencies. Crypto prices fluctuate unpredictably, making them unsuitable as a means of payment and as a reliable store of wealth. While most stablecoins are centralized, MakerDAO is different in that it has put forth a detailed plan for how to eventually decentralize the control of its stablecoin, dai.  Uniswap  Uniswap is a decentralized exchange, meaning that unlike most exchanges it never takes control of a user's funds. It's the most popular decentralized exchange so far. This exchange is a cornerstone of Ethereum's recent booming DeFi movement, facilitating trades from coin to coin. The project even attracted a ""vampire"" competitor, SushiSwap, which tried to suck up all its users. Another unique aspect of Uniswap is that it utilizes an automated market maker (AMM) system for facilitating trading, meaning the underlying liquidity pools that manage the actual coin-swapping are run by smart contracts as opposed to a traditional order book system.  When trading on a regular centralized crypto exchange, the market price for an asset is determined by supply and demand. In order to buy and sell, a trader must find someone on the opposite side of the order book to provide liquidity to complete a transaction. With AMM-based exchanges like Uniswap, a pricing algorithm determines the market price of each asset. Investors are incentivized to provide liquidity which is pooled together and used to execute all trades at the set market prices.  Chainlink  Chainlink is an oracle platform, which means it connects smart contracts with real-time data from the outside world such as weather information or stock prices. A smart contract uses that data to execute pre-defined instructions. For example, payout an insurance claim in the event of a hurricane.  While Chainlink has been around since 2017, the project didn’t really come to the forefront of the space until 2019 - after it partnered with Google. Chainlink is fuelled by an ERC-20 crypto token, LINK, and runs on top of the Ethereum network.  Axie Infinity  Axie Infinity is an online role-playing game where users collect and raise digital, fantastical characters called ""Axies."" Under the hood, Axies are types of nonfungible tokens (NFT), which means each one is cryptographically unique, gamers have full ownership over them and in some cases have a monetary value due to their scarce, collectible nature.  Aave  Aave is a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that recently raised $25 million from leading venture capital firms Blockchain.com and Blockchain Capital.  According to tracker DeFi Pulse, Aave is currently the fourth-largest DeFi app based on the $1.14 billion locked up in the app. It was briefly the largest earlier this year.  Other Ethereum dapps  Compound: A decentralized lending platform, Compound is credited with inventing liquidity mining, where the company releases a unique coin that only those providing liquidity to the platform can obtain. This DeFi technique has since become foundational, with users tapping the technique to make money and companies copying the idea to attract users.  WBTC: Wrapped bitcoin is a token on Ethereum that is backed 1:1 by bitcoin. The goal is to bring bitcoin’s liquidity to Ethereum. It has grown in popularity partly because investors can earn interest on the bitcoin they lock up on Ethereum.  SushiSwap: This decentralized exchange (DEX) is a fork of the popular decentralized Uniswap exchange that rewards liquidity providers with its own native SUSHI token. To date, it is a top 10 Ethereum DeFi app, according to DeFi Pulse.  Status: An ether wallet and private messaging system.  Unstoppable Domains: One of the oft-touted goals of Ethereum is to decentralize the internet by making apps that are not controlled by tech giants. Unstoppable Domains is playing its part by creating domains that can't be taken down by a central entity or government.  Kyber Network: A popular AMM, like Uniswap, created by researcher Loi Luu.  Basic attention token: An ERC-20 token on Ethereum exchanged between users, publishers, and advertisers on the browser Brave. When using the browser, users receive BAT from advertisers for their attention. BAT is a project led by the creator of JavaScript and co-founder of Mozilla, Brendan Eich.  OpenSea: A marketplace for buying and selling NFTs, including Axies (described above), unstoppable domains, digital art, etc.  Livepeer: A network for decentralized live-streaming, providing an alternative to YouTube.  Decentraland: A decentralized virtual reality game, where users own virtual plots of land and can build structures such as theme parks and casinos that can be monetized.  Additional types of Ethereum blockchain dapps  There are dozens of other crypto dapps with smaller user bases than the above services. Some were more popular prior to the DeFi boom and have historical importance.  Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)  0x  LocalEthereum  Balancer  Lending Platforms  Curve Finance  dYdX  Stablecoins  Tether: This popular stablecoin actually lives on many blockchains simultaneously. It is now dominating Ethereum transactions.  USDC  PAX  Prediction Markets  Augur  Gnosis  Storage Apps  Storj  Golem  Misc. dapps  Dark Forest  Tornado Cash: for private transactions on Ethereum.

Today's debut episode features guests Brian Brooks, former U.S. comptroller of the currency; Tim McCourt, global head of equity products at CME; and Yassine Elmandjra, an analyst for Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management.      Bitcoin shoots to new all-time high price above $44K: Tesla's disclosure early Monday that it bought $1.5 billion of bitcoin and will now accept it as a form of payment sent the cryptocurrency's price mooning more than 11% early Monday.      The announcement is ""yet another confirmation that bitcoin is going mainstream,"" Matt Blom, head of sales and trading for the cryptocurrency exchange firm EQUOS, wrote Monday in an email.      Ethereum futures go live on CME: The Chicago-based exchange has opened trading in its much-anticipated futures contracts on ether, the main cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. Prices for ether, which is the second-biggest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, rose to an all-time high last week above $1,700, partly on expectations the CME's new offering might lure more big institutional investors into the market.      Dogecoin pump: Prices for the doggie-faced meme token soared 70% on Saturday and Sunday after it apparently won over rapper Snoop Dogg and rocker Gene Simmons as new celebrity endorser-pumpers. (See Token Watch, below.) On Monday, dogecoin's price was down 3.9% to 7.5 cents.      In traditional markets, stocks were higher after U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen hit the Sunday talk shows to drum up support for a large stimulus package. The 30-year U.S. Treasury-bond yield rose above 2% for the first time in almost a year. Gold strengthened 0.4% to $1,821 an ounce.    The News    Tesla's #Bitcoin Moment: In an annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the year ending Dec. 31, 2020, the electric vehicle maker said, ""In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity,"" and that ""thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term."" Late last month, Twitter CEO Elon Musk caused a stir in the market when he added ""#bitcoin"" to his Twitter profile.      Miller Time: Investing-legend-turned-bitcoin-bull Bill Miller's $2.3 billion flagship fund has expanded its investment mandate to include purchases of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), up to 15% of assets under management. (EDITOR'S NOTE: Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, which also owns CoinDesk.)      Bitfinex-Tether: Cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex said Friday it repaid the remaining balance of a $550 million loan to its sister firm, Tether, the issuer of the tether (USDT) stablecoin. It's the latest development in a saga dating back to 2018, and the loan has drawn scrutiny from prosecutors in New York state.      Binance's Nigeria Suspension: The world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange has temporarily suspended deposits in Nigeria's domestic currency, the naira, after authorities in the country sent a letter on Friday instructing local banks to identify and close all accounts tied to cryptocurrency platforms or operations. Though after a wave of outrage on social media, the Nigerian central bank on Sunday issued a five-page statement clarifying that there was nothing new about the instructions.      #IndiaWantsBitcoin: Indian cryptocurrency exchanges have started a joint initiative to convince the country's parliament to regulate cryptocurrencies rather than impose an outright ban. But the Indian government still appears intent on fast-tracking a bill that would kick off development of a digital rupee while banning ""private cryptocurrencies.""    Chinese New Year    It's the Year of the Ox. Why would anyone sell?      The “Chinese New Year Dump” represents the belief among some cryptocurrency traders that bitcoin’s price typically drops around the Asian country's holiday period, starting this year on Feb. 12.      But it might not happen in 2021. Why? The theory is that the entry of big institutional investors in the U.S. and Europe into the market may mute the impact of retail traders in China, who in the past may have taken time off from the markets, reports CoinDesk's Muyao Shen. The bull run of 2017 was heavily powered by retail investors in Asia.      “It is just like how people in the U.S. would take profit from stock holdings before Christmas,” says Alex Zuo, vice president of China-based crypto wallet Cobo.      Fireworks: Chinese-language social media platforms are filled with discussions of whether the current bitcoin bull market might pause during the holiday season.      Plus, the year of the ox is coming in 2021, under the Chinese lunar calendar. As one might imagine, that's bullish. While some traders might have sold their bitcoin for the holiday, a large number investors in China are betting on a long-lasting positive market trend, and appear prepared to hold on into the new year.    Bitcoin Watch    Bullish case strengthens with rising inflation expectations      Even before the Tesla news hit early Monday, bitcoin's bullish case was strengthening, with U.S. inflation expectations on the rise, CoinDesk's Omkar Godbole writes.    U.S. 10-year inflation expectations, as implied in the market for government bonds, have climbed on Monday to a six-year high of 2.2%. Over the past 10 months, bitcoin prices appear to have risen in tandem with the inflation expectations.  Friday's disappointing report on the January employment situation in the U.S. appears to have crystalized support for President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package. (NOTE: Nonfarm payrolls rose by 49,000, well below the 250,000 increase projected by economists at Citigroup.)  ""Support for a large package is high now among the American population because the crisis is still top of mind and people want it to be over,"" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst for the brokerage firm Raymond James, wrote Friday in a report.  ""I'm not cutting the size of the checks,"" U.S. President Joe Biden said Friday.  The comments came despite nagging anxiety over the size of the package among members of the opposition Republican Party and even some Democrats.  ""There is a chance that macroeconomic stimulus on a scale closer to World War II levels than normal recession levels will set off inflationary pressures of a kind we have not seen in a generation, with consequences for the value of the dollar and financial stability,"" former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers wrote last week in an op-ed for the Washington Post.  More corporate treasurers are being pushed to consider bitcoin, following MicroStrategy's lead – and now Tesla's lead, too.  Token Watch    Dogecoin (DOGE): The rapper Snoop Dogg tweeted an image on Saturday with the words ""Snoop Doge"" at Elon Musk, the electric-vehicle and private-spaceflight entrepreneur who has himself recently promoted dogecoin (as well as bitcoin). The price pump helped give dogecoin, which was launched in 2013 as little more than a joke, a market capitalization of more than $9 billion, up more than 11-fold just this year alone. The Shiba Inu-themed token also got a shout-out from Gene Simmons, bassist for the rock band Kiss, who tweeted a glowing image of himself under the words, ""God Of Dogecoin."" The crypto news site Decrypt reported that one dogecoin address apparently held 27% of the entire coin’s entire supply, and the hashtags #dogecoinrise and #dogebowl were trending on Twitter at various moments. The entire thing was pretty DOGE-gone ridiculous.      Ether (ETH): The second-biggest cryptocurrency might be getting an uplift from traders rotating out of bitcoin into ether and other altcoins, CoinDesk's Daniel Cawrey reported. Joel Edgerton, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange BitFlyer USA, said he thinks of ether as an exchange-traded fund for decentralized finance, known as DeFi, which is a sector of the cryptocurrency industry where entrepreneurs are building software-based, automated versions of lenders and trading systems, mostly atop the Ethereum blockchain. ""Should DeFi projects continue to grow at the rate they are, it would be hard for ETH to not also continue setting new records,” said Guy Hirsch, managing director of U.S. for the online trading platform eToro. Chad Steinglass, head of trading at CrossTower Capital, says crypto traders have been scooping up ETH ahead of the Chicago-based CME exchange's launch of ether futures, scheduled for Monday. “The addition of CME futures will open the door to many potential investors who want to have exposure, but have yet to take any positions due to logistical hurdles.”      0x (ZRX): 0x Labs, the firm behind the decentralized exchange protocol and ZRX token, has closed a $15 million Series A equity round led by Pantera Capital, CoinDesk's Brady Dale reported. Additional funding participants included Jump Capital, Blockchain Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and others. The new round comes off the successful launching of 0x’s DEX router, Matcha, which came out in June and has processed $2.7 billion in orders. Prices for the ZRX tokens have nearly quadrupled this year, to a market capitalization of $1.4 billion.

Users will be able to interact by scanning QR codes provided within dapps. Subsequent transactions can then be securely signed within Ledger Live on their device within Ledger Live.

42433518,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOz4lh,1612792273,"Introducing CoinDesk TV: Industry-Leading Crypto News, Now in Living Color","Memes and internet mobs are paralyzing Wall Street and traditional financial markets.      Social unrest and geopolitical tensions are rising.      Changes in global leadership and a foggy outlook for tech and business regulations are causing uncertainty.      World economies are still locking down as a devastating global pandemic rages on.      Meanwhile, the prices of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are skyrocketing.      With this backdrop, I can’t think of a better time or purpose to launch CoinDesk TV.      When I joined CoinDesk in late 2019 with the mission of creating video programming comparable to TV news that would provide smart and insightful coverage of the cryptocurrency space and the digital revolution happening in global finance, the world was a very different place.      Our plan was to produce compelling live news programming and build a new studio to coincide with our flagship event, Consensus, which was scheduled for May 2020. Then, as COVID-19 shut down in-person events everywhere, everything changed.      Every team at CoinDesk helped turn Consensus into the best virtual event possible. We incorporated TV-inspired programming, with 24 straight hours of livestreamed shows with guests and hosts in locales ranging from New York to South Korea to the U.K. and Spain. Consensus: Distributed attracted about 23,000 registrants across five days, triple the number who had attended our annual event in Manhattan. Pivoting from daily live programming to a virtual event was not the beginning we anticipated for CoinDesk TV, but it proved to be an early test of our mettle and indicative of the long-term potential for our digital video products.    Watch CoinDesk TV    The successful launch last year of the CoinDesk Podcast Network – which now has seven shows and is ranked among the top 10 of all time on Apple Podcasts’ U.S. Business News list – exemplifies our vision to reach audiences across multiple platforms. Expanding to the visual medium is the next logical step. We’re excited to bring news and analysis about global cryptocurrency markets and blockchain technology, as well as many other adjacent stories, to life in a new way.      Despite the challenges of today’s environment, we’ve been building a reimagined CoinDesk TV that is bold and ambitious. Starting today, CoinDesk TV is rolling out three daily and three weekly shows with a lean team of 11, focused on delivering high-quality production and booking top-notch guests. Plus, we’ll be showcasing the deep bench of incredible talent in CoinDesk’s global team of reporters, editors, analysts and researchers.      (Doreen Wang)      True to CoinDesk’s reputation as the most trusted and influential media voice in this space, our goal is to make crypto and blockchain more understandable, informative and fun to everyone – from our loyal crypto stakeholders to individuals and financial professionals who are new to this space.      The restrictions of the pandemic increase the challenges. With guests and hosts scattered remotely, a COVID-era TV setup is much different from studio-based programs where people come in for face-to-face interviews that usually generate the most news and information. Meanwhile, we had several stops and starts in studio construction with material and building delays for various reasons, including staffing and supply chain hurdles.      With challenge, however, comes opportunity, and the global experiences of 2020 spurred our creativity. The downtime between bottlenecks allowed us to think about designing our control room with remote capabilities to produce shows using cloud-based technology. And for breaking news stories, we will be better prepared to provide coverage from anywhere in the world.      The COVID-19 environment has also created opportunities to connect with speakers far beyond New York City, and inspired us to think big about the audiences we aim to reach. Our diverse lineup caters to global investors, crypto enthusiasts and newcomers, and covers what investors need to know and what’s piquing the interest of the mainstream.      We view CoinDesk TV as an opportunity to bring to life the people and personalities who are disrupting digital finance and revolutionizing the way we use technology and the future of money. We invite you to join us as we tell this story.    How to watch CoinDesk TV    CoinDesk TV launches Feb. 8, 2021. Watch on CoinDesk.TV, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and THETAtv.

42433520,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOz4hh,1612791437,What Bloomberg Gets Wrong About Bitcoin's Climate Footprint,"Recently, Bloomberg published a piece calling Bitcoin an “incredibly dirty business.” It’s undeniable that the Bitcoin blockchain has a carbon footprint. Some bitcoins are mined with non-renewable energy, although plenty is mined with hydro, nuclear, or otherwise-vented natural gas, too. No one contests the externality of bitcoin, although the precise carbon footprint is debated. However, the article, by opinion columnist Lionel Laurent unfortunately relies on the flawed assumption that individual bitcoin transactions carry an energy overhead.      The question of bitcoin’s energy footprint is riven with misconceptions. Firstly, it’s a mistake to compare bitcoin to payment networks, and comparisons relying on relative energy use are spurious.    CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter is partner at Castle Island Ventures, a public blockchain-focused venture fund based in Cambridge, Mass. He is also the co-founder of Coin Metrics, a blockchain analytics startup.    Second, metrics like the “per-transaction energy cost” are misleading because transactions themselves do not cost energy; nor does bitcoin’s CO2 footprint scale with transactional count.      Bitcoin supporters and critics alike should understand how the protocol works, so the energy costs and externalities of the system can be honestly appraised.    Bitcoin and Visa: An apples-to-koalas comparison    In the Bloomberg piece, the author states:    One Bitcoin transaction would generate the CO2 equivalent to 706,765 swipes of a Visa credit card, according to Digiconomist’s closely-followed index, albeit with none of the convenience of plastic.    But the “energy exchange rate” methodology the author relies on is completely mistaken. Bitcoin transactions are not equivalent to Visa transactions. They are different in both form and substance.      First of all, Bitcoin and Visa are fundamentally different systems. Bitcoin is a complete, self-contained monetary settlement system; Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly.      Any energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil, which implicitly backs the dollar. As those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention, the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars. It’s worth noting that the grossly oversized U.S. military, whose presence worldwide is necessary to backstop the international dollar system, is the largest single consumer of oil worldwide.      Bitcoin transactions, by contrast, rely just on bitcoin. Bitcoin proposes a new monetary unit (also named bitcoin) and mediates its circulation through the Bitcoin protocol, which is administered by nodes and miners. Bitcoin’s energy footprint is highly transparent, due to the accessible and highly integrated nature of the system. This provides fertile ammunition for critics who can easily estimate the externalities of Bitcoin while insisting no equivalent ones exist for the dollar system. But the two systems are different.    Until Visa marshals its own private armies to keep the integrity of the dollar intact, the comparison will be a specious one.    Bitcoin is a full-stack monetary and payments system. Visa is a thin layer within the international dollar system, wholly reliant on seamless interoperability of the rest of the payments and settlement pyramid. Until Visa marshals its own private armies to keep the integrity of the dollar intact, the comparison will be a specious one.      If you look at the actual characteristics of Bitcoin transactions as compared with Visa, their differences are clear. While both systems transmit trillions of dollars of value per year, they do so in radically different ways.      In Q4 2020, Visa processed $2.4 trillion in payments volume via 49.6 billion transactions. That gives us an average transaction size of $46.37. Bitcoin, by contrast, settled $397 billion (using Coin Metrics’ adjusted volume estimates) over the period and handled 25.3 million transactions. The average transaction size for Bitcoin over the period: $15,719. During that time, there were eight distinct transactions worth over $1 billion. The largest among these settled a mammoth $2.48 billion, given bitcoin’s price at the time.      And not only can transactions be very large, but they can direct value to a number of recipients all at once. The largest-ever transaction in terms of payments contained 13,107 outputs. Under current constraints, a Bitcoin transaction could theoretically contain up to 32,256 outputs. And of course, layered or sidechain approaches which propose new trust models like Lightning, Liquid, RSK, and Stacks introduce the potential to batch thousands of transactions and settle them on the base layer. A single Bitcoin transaction can settle millions of lightning payments.      See also: Nic Carter - The Last Word on Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption      So not only are Visa transactions generally much smaller than Bitcoin transfers, but they are different from an assurance perspective. Bitcoin provides final settlement within a few blocks. This means there is no risk of transaction reversal. The payment itself is integrated with the settlement – there is no distinction. Visa credit payments, by contrast, are designed to be reversible, if need be. This is why cardholders generally have the option of making chargebacks within 90 days of their payment.      Much to the chagrin of some merchants, payments are not bundled with settlement. Instead, the Visa payment process is a tangle of distinct authorization, clearing, and settlement steps. Actual final settlement happens on an aggregate net basis between merchants banks (who manage the accounts for card-accepting merchants) and issuing banks (who manage the cardholder accounts) via ACH or wire transfer. This means that payments are bundled up and settled on an end-of-day basis through utility-grade settlement channels. The individual payments made when you swipe your card are several layers removed from the final flows of funds between banks.      These gigantic wire transfers that power settlement between cardholder banks and merchant banks for Visa are the transactions most comparable to those of Bitcoin. The individual payments happening between Visa users and Visa merchants are unsettled IOUs. If you consider ACH and especially Fedwire transfers, their characteristics are much more akin to Bitcoin. Typical ACH transfers clear thousands of dollars, while your average Fedwire transfer settles millions.      Fedwire transfers are “push” rather than “pull” – bank accounts have to be fully funded on the originating side for the transfer to process. No netting occurs in Fedwire: it is what’s called a “real-time gross settlement system.” Fedwire’s counterpart, CHIPS, which is used for international dollar settlements, does include significant netting (checking if banks are paying each other and only sending the difference). Unlike a check, or a Visa payment, you cannot reverse a wire transfer. This gives wires strong finality, and good settlement assurances (sound familiar?). And like Bitcoin, Fedwire processes a few hundred million transactions a year. In Q4, it averaged 550,000 txns per day. In that period, Bitcoin averaged 824,000 daily payments in 305,000 daily txns.      These systems scale with transactional size, not frequency. So if you’re going to compare Bitcoin to established transaction systems, compare like with like. (Note that SWIFT is not an apt comparison to Bitcoin: it is a messaging rather than a settlement system and generally relies on third-party settlement through Fedwire or CHIPS.)    Bitcoin’s energy cost of transactions explained    Now we’ve established that Bitcoin transfers are much more akin to wire transfers, let’s consider the actual “cost” of Bitcoin transactions. The quantitative assumptions made by Bitcoin critics – that transactions have a certain energy overhead – need to be contextualized.      Constructing a Bitcoin transaction, and getting the network to accept it, costs virtually no energy whatsoever. What costs energy is grinding through the nonce space to find valid blocks. Miners do this because they are compensated primarily with the coinbase reward of 6.25 BTC per block, which is defined in the protocol. Currently, miners collect about 15 percent of their total revenue of $40m per day in fees. But it’s important to decompose transaction fees and general revenue from creating blocks. Miners collect that coinbase reward regardless of whether they include transactions in blocks. On occasion, they mine empty blocks and collect that 6.25 per-block reward regardless.    The individual payments made when you swipe your card are several layers removed from the final flows of funds between banks.    The quantity of resources that miners are willing to spend on mining is purely a function of three variables: the price of bitcoin, the issuance rate and the fees transactors are paying to use the chain. Of those three, the first two matter most. As mentioned, fees are not a major source of revenue today. The system is naturally equilibrating: If the price of bitcoin goes up or fees dramatically rise, miner margins expand, inducing existing miners to increase their expenditure or new miners to enter the market. Thus margins contract to a level where mining is just barely profitable.      As defined in the protocol, the per-block reward is cut in half every four years. This reduces bitcoin’s issuance rate and thus the miner revenue. So, in the long term, miner revenue from issuance will dramatically contract. As 88% of all coins have been mined already, mining is structurally shrinking, not a growing industry. Academic prognostications of a climate-destroying feedback loop are therefore wildly off-base. While fees are expected to compensate miners in the long term, it’s unlikely that users would stomach $1000 fees. In a purely fee-based system with $10 fees and, optimistically, 800,000 transactions per day, miner revenue would total $2.9 billion per year – far less than the current $16.4 billion in annualized miner revenue.      Thus most of the miner expenditure – and hence carbon outlay – from Bitcoin is due to largely invariant coin issuance rather than any variable that’s correlated to transactional intensity. This fact invalidates the “energy cost of transactions” metric that critics like to promote. It is issuance that largely finances miners, not transactions. And because most coins have been issued already, Bitcoin’s future carbon outlay is likely to shrink. This is to say nothing of the energy mix that miners employ – and as we know, renewables and otherwise-vented natural gas make up a meaningful component of the industry. According to the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, 39% of Bitcoin’s energy outlay derives from renewables, with 76% of miners using renewables in some capacity.      Therefore, comparisons to Visa and other payments systems should be met with extreme skepticism. Bitcoin is a full-stack monetary system with no outside dependencies; Visa is a small part of the U.S. dollar stack that relies, among other things, on 11 aircraft carriers patrolling the world’s oceans and enforcing dollar hegemony. Visa payments rely on a vast interconnected infrastructure of clearing and settlement. Bitcoin transactions are natively final and settle right away – they are more comparable to wire transfers. The energy exchange rate comparisons must take these differences into account.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MINING,Nic Carter,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/08/what-bloomberg-gets-wrong-about-bitcoins-climate-footprint,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2f4f0e8462ec349de4cab6ae2136d0933b509d4-1420x947.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The lender has raised a $2.7 million second seed round led by White Star Capital with participation from Coinbase Ventures, Global Founders Capital, CMT Digital, Kingsway and Darrow Holdings, an affiliate of Susquehanna International Group.      Ledn has already developed Spanish descriptions of its service and cryptocurrency content, as well a Spanish-speaking support team, said co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Mauricio Di Bartolomeo.      The company also built its product set around what was popular in Latin America. Ledn’s stablecoin savings features and micro-loans as low as $500 are also popular in the region, Di Bartolomeo added.      “When we developed the products in LatAm, we realized that the average assets that each client would have were not going to be at the same level as they were in North America,” Di Bartolomeo said. “That’s not just limited to Latin America. That’s similar to a lot of emerging markets.”      The next step for the company is to expand into Africa, said Ledn CEO Adam Reeds.      Previously, the company had raised $1.55 million from Spark Power Group co-CEO Andrew Clark and Someren Capital in September 2018, which it used at the time to expand its lending operation in Canada.    Proof-of-reserves    The lender also recently engaged auditing firm Armanino LLP for a proof-of-reserves attestation.      Ledn gave Armanino a hash of the assets each client held on the platform as of Jan. 31 for the accounting firm to prove that the company’s assets outweighed its liabilities.

The announcement caps a history going back to at least 2018 of Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk tweeting and commenting on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies including dogecoin.      A growing number of big institutional investors including Paul Tudor Jones II and Bill Miller have pushed into bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation, as the Federal Reserve and central banks around the world pump trillions of dollars of freshly created money into financial markets to stimulate their coronavirus-racked economies. Tesla joins publicly traded companies including Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy that have steered corporate money into bitcoin.      Bitcoin's price shot up more than 14% after Tesla's disclosure to a new all-time high of $44,801, based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.

Only seven other publicly traded companies in the world are larger than bitcoin, though it's still well shy of gold's $11.7 trillion market value and silver's $1.5 trillion.

42433517,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyOz4jh,1612778662,Ethereum Futures Are Now Trading on CME,"The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) has launched its much-anticipated futures contracts for ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain network.      Announced in mid-December, trading in ether futures went live late Sunday, with the February contract registering an opening price of $1,669.75. At the time, the spot price stood at around $1,600.      The Chicago-based exchange has traded 77 contracts so far, with most activity concentrated on the February expiry. The futures contracts are legal agreements to buy or sell the crypto asset at a predetermined price at a later date.      CME's ether futures are cash-settled and based on the exchange's reference rate that includes data from major cryptocurrency exchanges Bitstamp, Coinbase, Gemini, itBit and Kraken.      The CME's regulated ether futures product may draw more institutional demand for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value, boosting the recent price rally.      ""The earliest traditional financial institutions that bought BTC are already looking at ETH, if not bought already. And rightfully so. The most used crypto network + future of finance + a potential deflationary monetary policy narrative make it extremely compelling,"" Qiao Wang, cryptocurrencies researcher and investor and co-founder of Messari, tweeted on Sunday.      Wang foresees ether rallying to $5,000 and higher in the long run. Ether is trading near $1,632 at press time, a 1% gain on the day, having reached record highs above $1,700 on Friday.      The cryptocurrency has more than tripled in value since the CME announced plans to list futures contracts on Dec. 16, mimicking bitcoin's surge from $6,000 to $19,783 seen in the weeks leading up to Dec. 17, 2017, when the exchange began trading bitcoin futures.      Also read: Ether Tops $1.7K, Setting New Record as CME Futures Launch Nears      While bitcoin topped out on the same day and subsequently moved into a year-long bear market, ether is likely to remain bid. ""The market is now more mature, the macro is different, and there are different players involved,"" trader and analyst Alex Kruger tweeted last week, ruling out a significant crash in ether.      Wang also voiced a similar opinion Sunday, warning that betting on an ether bear market would be ""the worst trade of your life.""      Patrick Heusser, head of trading at the Swiss-based Crypto Finance AG, foresees ether leading the broader market higher.

The Songs of Love Foundation, which became one of the first national children's charities to accept cryptocurrency donations in 2013, is a nonprofit that creates personalized songs to uplift children facing tough medical conditions or emotional challenges.      Launched Friday, the ""Billy Bitcoin"" superhero is part of the charity's efforts to increase donations through cryptocurrency, which it said on its website is ""even more efficient than donating cash.""      Crypto donations to charities are not taxed in most jurisdictions around the world. In the U.S., a person does not owe capital gains tax on the appreciated amount and can deduct his or her donation.      ""This win-win solution means you have more money available to donate to charity and can deduct more on your tax return,"" the charity's website reads. ""The difference can amount to more than 30%.""      Songs of Love accepts donations in 22 cryptocurrencies, from algorand to zcash.      On Feb. 16, the foundation will celebrate its 25th annivesary. Since its inception, the charity has created ""songs of love"" for more than 36,000 children worldwide.
