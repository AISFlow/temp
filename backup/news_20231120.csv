20469749,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561651,1700521258,Clear Skies: Why Bitcoin Overhead Resistance Is Weak,"Bitcoin price is only at $37,500 — a far cry from former all-time highs around $68,000. However, one visual technical analysis tool could show that overhead resistance is weak, and that the top cryptocurrency could rip right through what’s left. Could BTCUSD be back at all-time highs faster than most are ready for? Bitcoin Price Breaks Above The Monthly Ichimoku Cloud Technical analysts rely on a variety of tools to help provide signals to visually inspect and either manually or automatically take positions based on the results. One such tool, created by a Japanese journalist Goichu Hosoda, is called the Ichimoku. Hosoda was nicknamed “Ichimoku Sanjin” which loosely translates to “what the man in the mountain sees.” The idea behind the Ichimoku is that it provides an “at a glance” view of all market conditions. Related Reading: Learn All About The Ichimoku Cloud For example, the cloud plots where future support and resistance may lie. Meanwhile, the Tenkan-sen and Kijun-sen act as trend-following tools that cross bearish and bullish depending on price action. These spans can also act as support and resistance. With all that out of the way, all it takes is “one glance” at the chart below and we can see there is very little 1M BTCUSD resistance left. Bitcoin price is pushing above all major resistance | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Clear Skies Above Major Resistance, But Minor Pullbacks A Plenty Also at just a glance, it is possible to see how each time Bitcoin price passed through these spans and the Ichimoku cloud, an extended bull market formed. It is important to note, however, that the Tenkan-sen (blue) and Kijun-sen (maroon) are still crossed bearish. But this also happened prior to each bull run. Related Reading: Failed Bearish Signal Could Send Bitcoin To $85K Next Month Additionally, the lagging span has been omit from this chart. Called the Chikou span in Japanese, the lagging span shows where former support and resistance used to be, which means Bitcoin does have some less significant resistance levels to contend with at around $43,000 and again around $60,000. Beyond $60,000, the Ichimoku shows nothing but air. Could this really mean clear skies for Bitcoin once the Ichimoku cloud is officially left behind?

42409445,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPb8,1700520096,"Kraken Accused by SEC of Operating Unregistered Platform, Improperly Mixing Customer Funds","Kraken has joined Coinbase and Binance as targets of Securities and Exchange Commission accusations that the companies are operating without properly registering as securities businesses in the U.S.  The SEC highlighted a long list of tokens it considers securities that Kraken traded, each of which has now made multiple appearances in SEC enforcement actions.  Crypto exchange Kraken commingled customer and corporate funds while operating as an unregistered broker, clearing agency and dealer, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged in a new lawsuit Monday.  The federal regulator claimed that the San Francisco-based company violated federal securities laws in a repeat of its suits against other crypto trading platforms. Unique to Monday's lawsuit are claims that Kraken created a ""significant risk"" by commingling up to $33 billion in customer crypto with its own corporate assets, the regulator said, quoting Kraken's independent auditor.  ""Similarly, Kraken has held at times more than $5 billion worth of its customers' cash, and it also commingles some of its customers' cash with some of its own,"" the suit said. ""In fact, Kraken has at times paid operational expenses directly from bank accounts that hold customer cash.""  The SEC claims that Kraken simultaneously operates an unregistered broker, clearinghouse and exchange echoes its complaints against Binance and Coinbase, two exchanges the agency sued earlier this year.  Those suits are continuing. The SEC previously settled similar allegations against Bittrex's now-shuttered U.S. wing.  The federal regulator, as it has with those previous suits, listed a number of tokens it deemed to be unregistered securities, including the Algorand token (ALGO), Polygon's MATIC and NEAR. According to the suit, Kraken took a direct role in promoting these tokens to the investing public.  The SEC filing asks to permanently ban Kraken from operating as an unregistered exchange. The agency says it's also pursuing a fine and for Kraken to give back ill-gotten gains.  ""We disagree with the SEC's complaint against Kraken, stand firm in our view that we do not list securities and plan to vigorously defend our position,"" Kraken said in a statement. ""The SEC has repeatedly challenged crypto exchanges to come in and register without a single law supporting their position and no clear path to registration. And despite opposition from lawmakers, the SEC continues to pursue legal action against these crypto exchanges. For years, we have advocated for effective U.S. market regulation that addresses the unique risks and benefits which crypto presents to all individuals. We believe Congressional action is the most appropriate path to resolving the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. It is disappointing to see the SEC continue down its path of regulation by enforcement, which harms American consumers, stunts innovation and damages U.S. competitiveness globally.""  The exchange also published a blog post outlining its position.  The regulator settled charges tied to Kraken's staking services earlier this year.

20467785,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561632,1700517617,"SOL Price Forecast Takes Bearish Turn, Prepare For Potential Plummet To $30 Or Lower","Solana (SOL) has emerged as a prominent player in the dynamic world of cryptocurrency, showcasing a remarkable uptrend and delivering substantial gains. Despite a modest 3.6% correction in SOL price over the past 24 hours, the native token of the blockchain platform has recorded a significant increase of 43% over the past fourteen-day period. However, the sustainability of these gains may be in jeopardy, as the SOL price appears poised for a significant decline and deep correction following an impressive 346% surge over the past year. SOL Price Vulnerable To Significant Drop, $30 In Sight Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has shed light on the potential challenges ahead for SOL. Martinez highlights the TD Sequential indicator, which currently shows a sell signal on the weekly chart of SOL. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Hype: Bloomberg Intelligence Envisions $100 Billion Market If Regulatory Approval Granted The TD Sequential indicator, developed by market technician Thomas DeMark, is a technical analysis tool to identify potential trend reversals or exhaustion points in price movements. The indicator consists of consecutive candlesticks that meet specific criteria based on the time and price movements. It looks for specific patterns in the price action, including the arrangement of consecutive highs and lows and the overall trend direction. When the TD sequential indicator generates a sell signal, as seen on the SOL chart above, it indicates that the token is reaching a point of exhaustion in its uptrend, possibly indicating an impending correction or reversal. According to Martinez, if the bearish formation depicted by the TD Sequential indicator is confirmed, market participants may witness a downward swing for SOL price, potentially pushing it towards $45 or even dipping as low as $30. Solana Defies Correction Worries Despite the potential for a price correction in the coming days or weeks, Solana has demonstrated impressive growth across various fundamental metrics, as revealed by data provided by Token Terminal. When examining market capitalization, SOL’s circulating supply currently stands at $24.62 billion, denoting a remarkable increase of 138.78%. Furthermore, the fully diluted market cap is estimated at $32.77 billion, reflecting a substantial growth rate of 134.29%. SOL’s revenue has also grown significantly, with a notable increase of 106.55% over the past 30 days, amounting to $1.26 million. Scaling these figures to an annualized revenue of $15.28 million represents a healthy growth rate of 43.10%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 98.79% With Less Than 1 Million tokens Burned Transaction fees have also played a key role in SOL’s revenue generation. Over the past 30 days, transaction fees increased by 106.55% to $2.51 million. This represents a growth rate of 43.10% when extrapolated to annualized fee revenue of $30.56 million. Solana’s growing ecosystem is further evidenced by an increase in daily active users, which currently averages 128,180, reflecting a notable growth rate of 53.6% over the past 30 days. Additionally, the platform has seen an average of 82.83 core developers actively contributing to its development, indicating a growth rate of 13.1%. Currently, SOL is trading at $58, with the next support level at $55, which will be key to the token’s prospects.

Nick, a prominent crypto analyst and host of the Cheeky Crypto YouTube channel, has pinpointed three specific altcoins that he believes are poised for significant growth in the forthcoming market surge. Based on current market trends and developments, Nick’s analysis highlights these altcoins for their unique features and potential growth trajectories. These predictions offer insights into which could be the next big movers in the crypto world. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Projects $7 Trillion Market Cap For Altcoins – Here’s When Three Altcoins Poised For Potential Surge Solana (SOL) is one of the three altcoins that caught Nick’s eye for its chart structures and potential scalability. Regardless of initial hesitations, the analyst acknowledges Solana’s robust technical setup, which he believes could propel its price to “phenomenally high numbers” in the next bull run. Nick predicts Solana could hit a target as high as $7,500, although he also offers a more conservative estimate of $2,000, considering potential future developments that might impact its growth. While Solana currently trades at a price nearing $60, a more practical short-term target, according to Nick, could be $600 to $700. The analyst advised investors to be cautious about the potential market impact when large amounts of SOL become available for sale after a lock-up period and to consider this in their investment strategy. Nick noted: Obviously, there are a lot of [Solana] tokens that are locked up for Solana so we basically start seeing a lot of those tokens being distributed and the lockup periods are expiring in 2025 March so this means we really want to make sure that we are out of our positions before those billionaires have the ability to dump on us. Chainlink (LINK) is also another altcoin found on Nick’s radar. The analyst appreciates Chainlink’s importance in the blockchain industry and anticipates its increasing exposure and adoption could lead to a substantial capital influx. Nick’s theoretical projection sees Chainlink reaching up to $2,300, while a more grounded expectation places it between $200 and $400 during the next crypto bull run.

42409433,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHP0l,1700513109,The PYTH Airdrop Is Finally Here. But What Is Pyth Network?,"The buzz around this week's token airdrop from Pyth Network, a blockchain oracle firm that competes with Chainlink, has shed light on a long-simmering battle between companies to bring the nascent digital-asset industry's infrastructure up to the demands of traditional finance.  JPMorgan and Visa stand out as the latest ""TradFi"" firms to integrate ""decentralized ledger"" technology and other crypto concepts into their systems.  Oracle services like Chainlink [LINK] have played a key role in spearheading this merger between the old and the new, allowing blockchains to pull in information, such as price feeds, from crypto exchanges and other real-world data sources.  But for the marriage of centralized and decentralized finance to prosper, crypto infrastructure needs to rise to the task – meaning traders need access to the kind of minute-to-minute market data that they've grown accustomed to in a world of transcontinental cables and high-frequency price feeds.  That's where Pyth comes in. Like Chainlink, Pyth is an oracle service – a platform that feeds data to blockchains. But Pyth's market-focused ""real-time data"" feeds are marketed as faster than Chainlink's, something that's supposed to make the service better-tuned to certain financial use cases.  Originally on Solana blockchain  Originally designed for the speed-centric Solana [SOL] blockchain and later built out into its own chain, Pythnet, based on Solana's technology, the project claims on its website that it refreshes its data feeds at 300-400 millisecond intervals. Chainlink's refresh rate, by contrast, can range from minutes to hours.  Chainlink's comparatively slow pace comes down to how it sources data, by relying on ""decentralized"" consortiums of third-party data providers and a network of node operators to report out information. Chainlink's price feeds refresh at set intervals, or dynamically in response to market volatility, but recent latency-focused updates have brought significant speed improvements for some applications.  Pyth, by contrast, sources data directly from first-party financial institutions – both traditional and crypto-centric – like Jane Street and Binance. This institution-driven system carries whiffs of ""centralization"" – anathema to the disintermediating world of crypto. But Pyth's sub-second refresh model is several orders of magnitude faster than some competing services, supposedly better-tuned to serving the demands of modern finance.  Like Chainlink and other competing services, the Pythnet network can aggregate its price measurements from multiple sources. Pyth, on its website, claims to rely on various game theory and cryptography practices to ensure its numbers are reported accurately; for example, the ""bridge"" service that Pyth uses to relay data to blockchains, Wormhole, automatically runs certain checks before reporting numbers to blockchains.  While these validation services can help protect Pyth's numbers from tampering, the system – like those of other oracle protocols – can still risk measurement errors if multiple sources report inaccurate numbers.  PYTH airdrop  Pyth kicked off the highly-anticipated airdrop of its PYTH token this week. The new cryptocurrency will double as votes in the protocol's governance system, meaning the tokens can be ""staked"" by users who want to weigh in on how Pyth's tech evolves or who can publish data to its oracles.  The token, whose supply will be distributed, in part, to around 90,000 crypto wallets that have previously interacted with the protocol, is currently trading at $0.33, down from a height of $0.51.  In addition to jump-starting the market for a new token, protocols frequently use airdrops as a tactic to gain attention and attract users.  The Pyth Network currently ranks as the fourth-largest oracle project, with $1.5 billion in total value secured (TVS), according to DefiLlama. Chainlink has a TVS of $14.7 billion, followed by WINkLink with $7.74 billion and No. 3 Chronicle with $6.72 billion.  But in terms of networks served, Pyth ranks second with 120, just behind Chainlink's 361.  Correction (Nov. 21, 21:23 UTC): Clarifies the article to reflect that a latency-focused update to Chainlink has already gone live, and isn't ""coming soon.""",NEUTRAL,LINK | PYTH,BLOCKCHAIN | LINK | TRADING | PYTH | AIRDROP,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/11/20/the-pyth-airdrop-is-finally-here-but-what-is-pyth-network,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccf5a6f87b05a71e9c6294c49f37f60c1b10be91-553x311.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409443,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPRD,1700512745,Does Worldcoin Need a Reevaluation? Understanding Sam Altman’s Crypto-AI-UBI Experiment,"There’s a shakeup happening in tech, and crypto is a part of it. On Friday, OpenAI co-founder and CEO Sam Altman was unceremoniously deposed. The board of directors for the organization, which was founded as a non-profit and later added a corporate, profit-driven division led by Altman, used fighting words in its initial announcement of the termination.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Altman, apparently, “was not consistently candid in his communications with the board.” Little else was said, leading to speculation. OpenAI, the developers of several artificial intelligence tools, including the fastest app to gain a million users, ChatGPT, is often called “the most important startup” in the world.  Crypto, like nearly every other industry, has been testing the AI waters. This embryonic tech is being forecasted to change how developers build and audit apps, how traders make portfolios and how users interact with it all. And one of crypto’s most important AI pushes, Worldcoin, has an Altman connection.  Worldcoin, a protocol for universal, digital IDs being built by Tools for Humanity, a company Altman co-founded, initially saw its token collapse on the news. Today, it’s up double digits after Altman was scooped up by Microsoft to lead internal AI R&D — a remarkable vote of confidence at a moment when the backstory for the firing hasn’t been entirely, publicly filled in.  See also: Jeff Wilser - The Untold Story of Worldcoin’s Launch: Inside the Orb  It’s also a signal that when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI, it was investing in Altman. In a lot of ways, the Worldcoin speculators too are betting on the AI pioneer. While OpenAI and Worldcoin are entirely distinct entities, there are close parallels between the two outside of the mutual point of connection in Altman. (There is no reason to believe Microsoft will have any dealings with WRD.)  Both AI and the crypto-based universal basic income (UBI) Worldcoin is ultimately building towards are both largely unproven technologies. And both have similarly skeptical — if distantly fascinated — audiences, with some who think these technologies could independently tear society apart. They’re moonshots, meant to catapult humanity as a whole forward.  And to a large degree, Worldcoin has been unfairly maligned. When announced in 2019, the world was shaken by the project’s dystopian trappings. Not only is it founded by a man who many think could become the world’s first trillionaire (who is building an island bunker), but the World ID system works by scanning people’s irises using a metal sphere called the Orb. It’s straight out of sci-fi.  Putting aside appearances, the project itself has a lot going on. Some of the smartest people I know in tech are enthralled by what’s actually being built. Worldcoin developers are working on zero knowledge (ZK) cryptography solutions for safer biometric scanning. No one has yet cracked persistent personhood online. While the project’s leadership, including CEO Alex Blania, are sometimes spoken about in hushed tones.  See also: Worldcoin and the Intellectual Decline of Venture Capital  Worldcoin may end up being a tremendously expensive blunder, as any startup could. But there’s a difference between evaluating a company on its merits and its aesthetics. And, to steal a phrase from internet-famous economist/blogger Tyler Cowen, most of the conversations around Worldcoin are just “mood affiliation” — people saying what they think others want to hear.  It’s entirely possible, for instance, that everyone I know who likes Worldcoin is just into the idea of a project that is being built as a precautionary measure in anticipation of when (or if) AIs develop the ability to create their own real or fake virtual identities and drown out humanity … because they take Asimov too seriously.  Altman, who was mostly known for his stint leading massively successful startup incubator Y Combinator at the time Worldcoin was announced, saw his reputation explode after becoming the face of OpenAI. And his standing has only seemed to increase after getting laid off.  He’s controversial, too. Some call Altman a “generational talent,” one of the greatest fundraisers in Silicon Valley. Others say he has “failed up.” Loopt, a mobile app and his start in tech, didn’t gain traction but got him a $43.4 million exit. As President, YC grew quickly under Altman but is also said to have lost its soul. In 2014, he spent less than a Scaramucci as CEO of Reddit.  He’s also thought to be in talks to found a chip foundry to compete with NVIDIA, with backing from controversial investors in the Middle East and China. He’s the largest shareholder in Humane AI, which is building a non-phone, mobile AI “pin,” but has been largely ambivalent about its launch.  In other words, Altman’s association with Worldcoin is a matter of interest but there’s zero chance he’s very much involved. Other factors, like the privacy concerns raised by the government of Kenya, the onboarding concerns from MIT Technology Review have raised and concerns over the system's proprietary tech, are more salient. Citizen journalists have tried prying into (aka a ""decentralized audit"") the Orb, for instance, with limited success.  It’s no secret that tech is in a transitional moment. The so-called “techlash” is waning, in part because the promise of AI now seems revolutionary – when this time last year the tech barely seemed feasible. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence and deserve scrutiny.

20463916,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561593,1700510448,Crypto Market Expert Identifies The Trigger For 600% Bitcoin Price Surge,"In a recent analysis, a crypto market expert has discovered key elements that could trigger a massive surge in the Bitcoin price. Crypto Expert Reveals Bitcoin Price Surge Catalyst Head of Research at CoinShares, James Butterfill has published an in-depth analysis of a revelation that could catalyze a significant increase in Bitcoin’s price. Butterfill’s research delves deep into the present dynamics of the crypto market surrounding the potential approval of Spot Bitcoin ETFs and the inflows that could follow. Related Reading: Argentina Welcomes First Pro-Bitcoin President, BTC Price Surges Above $37,000 Using an analysis by Galaxy, Butterfill deduced that if 10% of the $14.4 trillion addressable assets within the US were to go into Spot Bitcoin ETFs, each with a 1% allocation, then over $14.4 billion inflows would be witnessed. If the predictions prove true, Butterfill has stated that it would signify the largest influx ever seen in the financial markets. “One could assume that perhaps 10% invest in a spot bitcoin ETF with an average allocation of 1%, which would equate to US$14.4 billion of inflows in the first year. If this were correct then it would be the largest inflows on record, with the largest so far being in 2021, which saw US$7.24 billion of inflows, representing 11.5% of assets under management (AuM),” Butterfill stated. The crypto expert also highlighted a distinct correlation between asset under management (AuM) inflows and price changes, suggesting that price surges occur around the same time inflows increase. “There does seem to be a relationship between inflows as a percentage of AuM and change in price. Inflows do appear to be coincident, the week the prices rise so do flows rather than one leading the other,” Butterfill said. Expert Predicts Massive BTC Surge If Trigger Events Unfold In his research, James Butterfill also predicted that the price of Bitcoin could rise as high as $141,000 if driven by $14.4 billion inflows. He stated reservations about his deductions, citing that it would be difficult to accurately estimate the amount of inflows that would occur if Spot Bitcoin ETFs were introduced. “If we take the aforementioned US$14.4 billion of inflows, the model suggests it could push the price up to US$141,000 per Bitcoin. The problem with the estimate of inflows is that it is very difficult to ascertain exactly how much inflows there will be when the spot ETFs are launched,” Butterfill stated. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $1.35 As These Metrics Heat Up Butterfill also acknowledged the uncertainties surrounding demand for Spot Bitcoin ETFs following its potential approval. He stated that there were many variables, both regulatory and corporate that could significantly influence the perception of Bitcoin’s role in society. “Ultimately, it is very difficult to ascertain just how big the potential wall of demand will be once a spot-based ETF is launched. We know that it effectively diversifies a portfolio and enhances Sharpe ratios, but regulatory approval and corporate acceptance are slow-burn issues due to Bitcoin’s perceived complexity,” Butterfill concluded.

42409450,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPKb,1700509191,"Ali Yahya, Andreessen Horowitz: 'Many Fair Weather VCs Have Pivoted'","If you’re reading this, odds are you’ve heard the cliche that “Crypto Winter is the time for building.” It’s almost a mantra -- even a lifeline -- for those who believe in the underlying tech, have faith that the markets will bounce back, and are focused more on products than prices.  What’s less understood is that “crypto winter is the time for investing.” Or at least it is for the ones who are sticking around, such as the deep coffers of Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), which has now raised over $7 billion of capital for the crypto space, according to General Partner Ali Yahya.  Jeff Wilser is a book author, journalist, ghostwriter, and the host of the “AI-Curious” podcast.  “We’re still running the 85-person crypto team, and we’re 100% committed on crypto as a space,” says Yahya, who brushes off concerns that Marc Andreessen’s recent Techno-Optimist Manifesto did not specifically mention crypto. (Yahya explains that a16z’s other co-founder, Ben Horowitz, is the one who’s more crypto-focused.)  How can crypto winter lead to good investments? The way Yahya sees it, if you’re a founder and you’re launching in a bear market, that means you believe. You’re not here for a cash grab. You have conviction. “They have decided to bet their company, or even their career, in this space,” says Yahya. “Those are the people that we like to back.”  On a recent Zoom interview, Yahya appears upbeat, focused and fit. And by “fit” what I really mean is ripped. He’s bald, bearded, and wears a t-shirt that he looks ready to burst out of, Incredible Hulk-style. There’s even a sneaky connection to fitness and investing. “In power lifting, you're essentially maxing out, and you are completely stressing your body all the way to its limit,” Yahya says, explaining that this requires discipline and focus, and that spills into the rest of his life.  This could even be a metaphor for crypto winter. “In some ways, the winter filters out the nonbelievers, right?” says Yahya, who shares what he looks for in a startup team, what he thinks it will take for crypto to reach true mainstream adoption, his advice for Web3 founders, why he now has a drive to “run into the fire, to almost seek out uncomfortable experiences, and then reframe them.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Dude, you look fit. We’re immediately changing this interview to your fitness regimen.  Ali Yahya: [Laughs.] Thank you, I really appreciate it. I’m training for this competition at the end of the year.  Which one?  It’s a power lifting competition in New York, the Tone House Lift Off.  This could be a stretch, but I’m guessing there’s a connection between the discipline in your fitness training and the discipline required for smart investing, and how you sharpen your mind.  Yeah, absolutely.  So, let’s start with the fitness. What’s your routine like?  Well, I’ve always been into fitness, but most recently, I really got into this idea that you can reframe any kind of discomfort. So much of discomfort is actually in the mind. You can reframe it to actually feel like it's constructive, like it’s a more pleasant or pleasurable feeling than it really is.  This sounds similar to the Stoic philosophy?  Yes, it's very much inspired by Stoicism, and I think through a couple of very intense romantic relationships as well, a couple years ago. I went down this deep rabbit hole about how to process pain and how to deal with suffering.  And my inclination since then has been to run into the fire, to almost seek out uncomfortable experiences, and then reframe them. And as a result, kind of reshape the relationship that I have with pain.  One of the big challenges in a bull market is trying to get at the true motivations of the founders  This is where power lifting comes in?  In power lifting, you're essentially maxing out, and you are completely stressing your body all the way to its limit. So that’s a direct manifestation of that. My training routine is basically three days of lifting every week, with a trainer who absolutely almost kills me. I come out of it feeling like I'm a new man, and that does kind of set the tone for everything else. Because now anything that feels uncomfortable day-to-day, that’s just a fraction of the way you feel when your body’s about to break. It creates a rhythm that keeps me disciplined and keeps me focused.  Okay speaking of “pain,” it’s not hard to see the parallel for the last year or so in crypto…  Yeah. In some ways, the winter filters out the nonbelievers, right? The people who are not fully bought in, who haven't fully searched their souls and found the compelling nature of Web3 sort of within them.  So as a result, it's a great time for consolidation, right? For the folks who are maybe here for the wrong reasons or here for more opportunistic reasons, to go and pivot to something else like AI.  There’s a lot of that!  And then the people who are actually hardcore, and who really do understand why the technology is truly valuable, will actually build the foundation for the next generation of the internet.  That makes sense for the space as a whole. How about on a company level?  For individual companies, going through this period forces a certain kind of discipline. Now you have to rely on your own conviction that the space will come back, right? That this all will work.  I think it tests the culture, it shapes the culture, it makes it stronger. It forges it into something that's likely more durable. And it's just the best time to do really good work. Because you're not distracted by all the noise; it’s easy to just be heads-down and build. And then also from an investing standpoint, some of the best investments are made in the troughs right off winters like this.  How would you describe the VC landscape for crypto and Web3 right now?  It’s a similar dynamic, where many “fair weather” VCs have pivoted out of the space. And now they’re chasing the next hot thing, which is AI at the moment. So only a small number of investors who truly get the space -- and who have been in it for a very long time -- remain. For us, we’re not pivoting out, we’re open for business. There’s little competition and we’re able to make the investments we want to make.  That’s great for you guys at a16z, but I’m guessing from the perspective of Web3 founders, it’s tougher, right? There’s less funding supply in the space than there used to be?  Yeah.  There’s less dollars to go around, so it’s tougher for the average Web3 startup to get funding?  Yes, that’s right. It’s a less ideal time to raise money for sure. Fortunately, a lot of the great founders and great companies were able to raise money and capitalize themselves at the height of the last bull market, so now they have enough dry powder to weather the winter, and focus on building.  Are you still deploying capital into projects?  Yeah, definitely. It’s not as fast as it was in 2021, but we’re certainly still investing. I do think some of the best investments may come from times like this, in particular when we invest in companies that are starting now.  Interesting. Why’s that?  For founders who are actively choosing to start a crypto or Web3 company now, just consider what that says about them, right? The fact that they are not starting an AI company, they're starting a crypto company in the depth of winter, that means that they must really believe. That means they have fully gone down the rabbit hole and understand why crypto is a promising space. They have decided to bet their company, or even their career, in this space. Those are the people that we like to back.  So we're very much on the lookout for those people. And those would be very early-stage companies. Oftentimes it would be first money in, and so it's a small amount of capital. That's not a way to deploy a lot of capital quickly, but again, we believe that those might actually lead to some of the best investments and some of the best companies.  And by the way, this kind of dovetails with what we're doing with our Crypto Startup School. It's an accelerator program that targets very early-stage companies; we’re going to run this next one in London. We think it’s a perfect pairing for winter, because we want to go after these really early-stage companies with conviction.  How is evaluating investments in a bear market different from evaluating them in a bull market?  One of the big challenges in a bull market is trying to get at the true motivations of the founders. And so in a bull market, it's very important to ask all sorts of questions to get at, “Why are you doing this?” It could be very opportunistic. It could be a cash grab. It could be because it seems like the sexy thing to do. So that's a big difference.  Another difference is that we definitely have to think about the go-to-market in the short to medium term. So the fact that these companies are being started in the winter, and the fact that the winter might continue for a long time, means we have to factor that in our decision about whether or not to invest. So if the success of the company depends strongly on, you know, one thousand application developers to arrive fairly quickly and start building on top of whatever infrastructure they're building, that’s harder.  There’s obviously been a ton of attention on Marc Andreessen’s “The Techno-Optimist Manifesto.” I know you didn’t personally write it, but how does the ethos of this manifesto guide the way you view investments? And then as a follow-up, should the crypto space be worried that the manifesto didn’t mention crypto?  I’ll take the second part first. Not at all. I think the manifesto is intended to target technology more broadly. And in fact, there was a follow up podcast with Marc and Ben [Horowitz], and there’s a big section there about crypto in particular, because Ben tends to spend much more time with our crypto team than Marc. So I think it was less top-of-mind for Marc when he wrote it.  How big is the crypto team by the way?  We’ve raised about $7.5 billion for crypto, and we’re still running the 85-person crypto team and we’re 100% committed on crypto as a space.  And how does the ethos of the manifesto guide your view on investments?  Well, at its core, startups really only work when you have a kind of optimism about the future, and about the kinds of changes that you can make in the world through technology. So I think both from the lens of an investor and the lens of a startup founder, you have to have some sort of belief in the positive effect that technology can have.  We want to invest in people who have big visions for the future, who believe that the future can be much better than it is today. Like, any founder who believes that the future will be the same as it is today or will be worse, is almost by definition not someone that we could back.  On a more mundane note, how does regulation fit into all of this? I’ve spoken with founders who are so confused by the state of U.S. regulation, it impacts what products they will build. Does that have a similar impact on your investment analysis?  Yeah. It's a very big factor. I mean, we are strong believers that regulation is necessary and we just have to have smart regulation. We’re working hard at trying to educate people in Washington, people who are policymakers, people who are in government about what the technology is, so that hopefully we end up with sensible regulation.  Another thing that we do is spend a lot of time with our portfolio, helping them navigate the regulatory landscape and helping them think strategically about the risks involved, especially when there's a lot of uncertainty. You have to basically make a decision as to what risk you're willing to take, and you need really smart legal people around the table to make those decisions. So we often play that role and we help our founders make hard choices when the law is really not clear.  What advice would you give Web3 founders who are building? I know the party line is to “build, build, build,” but on top of that, for those hoping to get funding at some point, what advice would you give?  So it depends strongly on the stage. For very early-stage, it ultimately comes down to the team that you're able to bring together. Because we primarily invest in people that very early stage. That's by far the dominant factor.  And later stage?  It's always good to be able to show some kind of product-market fit. So that the thing that you have built is now being pulled out from you, from the company by the market, by your users, your customers, developers, whoever it may be. And really what you now have to do is just go faster because they cannot get it fast enough. And what you need is to kind of pour fuel on the fire to be able to go faster and meet the demand of the market more quickly.  Last question, and this goes back to our theme of optimism. What does your gut tell you will be the eventual driver of mainstream Web3 adoption?  It's a really good question. We can't just keep talking about why crypto is valuable. I think what will have to happen is that someone builds an application that drives real value, that ends up reaching 100 million users or more.  And I think this could happen in a number of different categories. It could be a company like Farcaster, which is building a decentralized social network that's somewhat like Twitter, where the user controls their own identity and controls who they can follow and who follows them. Something like that could reach 100 million users. And that would be a very strong statement for why blockchains are powerful, especially given what's going on with Twitter now.  Read more: What Web3 Means to Andreessen Horowitz  It could also be a game, like a crypto-enabled game that has a full-on crypto economy that's interoperable with the economies of other games, where you can own your character. There are many games that are in the works. It just takes a long time to build a game. So that could be one.  What else?  It could also be something like sound.xyz where you have a decentralized music streaming platform, where artists can connect with their fans directly. Like where you can essentially buy an NFT to be able to comment on the artist’s track on the interface, in the way that you could with SoundCloud back in the day.  It's a super simple thing, but it's a way of creating a community that has this financial element to it, such that now artists can have an economic relationship with their fans, right? That is direct. There are no intermediaries, no labels. Spotify doesn't take a huge cut. So if a number of really major artists go through that process and are able to monetize their music in a way that becomes very public, then I could see that being a watershed moment where it's like, holy shit, this is just a better model for creative people to monetize their work. So that could be another way.  Those are maybe three possibilities, but I think one of them at some point has to really break out in order for crypto to really get to the next level.  Love the optimism. Thanks again, and good luck with the power lifting competition.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Jeff Wilser,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/11/20/ali-yahya-andreessen-horowitz-many-fair-weather-vcs-have-pivoted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6c445dd79c7c02593d7c7ff8f1e872d27a8d9226-768x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The company behind ChatGPT fired one of its founders and CEO, Sam Altman, sparkling downside pressure for AI-based tokens, such as FET. Related Reading: Altcoin Corrections Signal Strong Buy Opportunities: Crypto Analyst The native token for Fetch.ai, FET, has been trending to the upside following the general market sentiment. Over the past month, the cryptocurrency recorded a 160% rally, and it’s poised for further profits as it breaches critical resistance levels. OpenAI Controversy Adds Fuel For FET’s Rally Data from Coingecko indicates that FET’s bullish momentum took a hit last week as news about Sam Altman leaving OpenAI broke. The token has been moving with any development from the broader AI sector, and the uncertainty surrounding this company has impacted its performance on low timeframes. Over the weekend, FET regained its bullish momentum and reclaimed territory, extending a more significant rally. In that sense, a pseudonym trader looked into FET’s potential target as the cryptocurrency continues “its rally without a dip.” In the past week, FET breached the resistance at $0.56, targeting its 2022 highs, as seen in the chart below. If the bullish momentum continues, the token could rise to its 2021 highs between $0.70 and $0.90. FET Rally Could End In Massive Correction Our Editorial Director and analyst, Tony Spilotro, has been bullish on FET’s trajectory. The analyst believes FET could rise 2x to 4x before losing steam and re-visiting support. In the past, whenever the token followed a similar trajectory, printing a buy signal above the monthly Bollinger Band, as Spilotro stated, FET corrected by an impressive 80%. Thus, the analyst recommended new investors to tread carefully. Spilotro said: (…) its safe more than likely to buy FET at such levels, so long as you have a plan to get out before the next 70+% correction happens. Otherwise, price could retrace back to your entry here. Be smart and don’t expect the rally to go on forever.

Solana To Hit $1,000 By 2024 ChatGPT believes Solana is well positioned for a bullish run, expecting to be at the $1,000 mark by 2024. The bot’s prediction results from positive market developments and the broad use of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain. The bot has also been seen predicting that the price of SOL could reach $1,000 by the end of 2024. This is due to the cosmic surge of innovations and widespread adoption. Solana propelled by a cosmic surge of innovation and widespread adoption, could potentially reach a stellar price of $1000 by the end of December 2024. ChatGPT‘s prospects seem promising due to several recent factors that spark growth for the cryptocurrency. The crypto’s blockchain has recently garnered strong interest from the cryptocurrency community. Its excellent performance, minimal transaction costs, and scalability have drawn an increasing number of users and developers. This sparks increased adoption of Solana-based innovations, positioning the digital asset for a potential price increase. In addition, the crypto asset’s increase in demand for leverage longs could also buttress this prediction. SOL reached its highest level of futures open trade since its all-time high price of $260 in November 2021. The demand for the cryptocurrency is anticipated to increase as the Solana ecosystem grows, pushing up the asset’s price. The crypto’s asset Total Value Locked (TVL) is not left out. Solana’s TVL recently experienced a significant surge in its TVL. Its TVL was approximately valued at $409.68 million, but now $584.59 million, indicating over a 42% increase, according to DefiLlama. Related Reading: Solana DEX Trading Volume Spikes 54% In The Last Week, TVL Climbs Current Market Trend Sparks Price Increase For The Cryptocurrency Another factor that could propel the asset’s price is the current bullish sentiment of the cryptocurrency market. Without a doubt, Solana has been the market’s most optimistic large-cap cryptocurrency this year. Related Reading: Crypto News: Solana’s Trading Volume Hits $3.5 Billion; New Cryptocurrency Gains Traction in the Market SOL has increased by approximately 550% since the beginning of 2023. This puts it at the fifth position among all the top 100 cryptocurrencies in terms of performance. Last week, SOL experienced a significant price surge, reaching its yearly high of $68. Due to the general attitude of the market, the price of Solana could thrive in this conducive atmosphere. Currently, the crypto asset is trading at approximately $60 as of writing, indicating a 0.21% increase in the past 24 hours. Its market capitalization is currently valued at $25,435,629,906, indicating the same percentage increase in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap.

42409442,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPNu,1700503197,Solana's Latest Block Explorer Shoots for Simplicity,"Blockchains may be transparent, but Solana's data-heavy ledger might be better described as translucent. A new block explorer called Quantum is vying to change that.  Built by the the team behind SolanaFM, the overhauled block explorer prioritizes simplicity in its presentation of what's happening on the Solana blockchain, its developers say. That's a notable difference from many other Solana ecosystem explorers, many of which (including SolanaFM) are detail-oriented at the expense of easy readability.  The service, which already has 53,000 signups, debuts as the entire Solana ecosystem emerges from a prolonged downtrend, led by the rallying price of SOL itself. It's trading at $59 at press time, up from $19 during the depth of the bear market.  For users wanting to make sense of the on-chain data, these transaction browsers help humans parse the mountains of crucial but imperceptible data that prove X token went to Y address.  ""You don't want to have to be running a sophisticated computer system to be able to"" make sense of a blockchain, the former FTX chief Sam Bankman-Fried said during his recent trial (the judge had asked him to explain what block explorers are). ""So there are a variety of providers that created websites that listed out in a centralized but easy-to-view fashion all of the transfers on the Blockchains.""  SolanaFM is one of a handful of such companies building these websites for the Solana blockchain, whose transactions are notoriously not ""easy-to-view."" The high speed blockchain creates reams of unstandardized data that block explorers struggle to present in an intuitive way. Solana ecosystem explorers are nowhere near as streamlined as Ethereum's Etherscan.  By SolanaFM's own count its eponymous block explorer is the Solana ecosystem's third most popular, behind the first-to-market portal from the Solana Foundation and another from a third-party service called SolScan.  ""We realize our explorer was overbranded"" because first-timers thought it was a podcast, SolanaFM CEO Nicholas Chen said.  He's trying to eat away at the incumbents' ""huge market share"" by changing his explorer's name to Quantum but perhaps more importantly improving its user experience: basically, its presentation of all that head-scratching data.  ""Users in general get a less detailed UI, but are straight to the point, splashing information that's ESSENTIAL for them to understand what they’re reading in less than 3 seconds,"" he said.",POSITIVE,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/20/solanas-latest-block-explorer-shoots-for-simplicity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/31cdcd79164a76774a00801150760b9955a33e2c-5184x2916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42409438,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPAg,1700502698,Argentina’s Election: What Bitcoiners Are Getting Wrong,"By now, if you follow crypto media or crypto Twitter, you’ll have seen streams of headlines and posts crowing about the victory of Javier Milei in Argentina’s general elections yesterday. This is uncomfortable as it highlights how blinkered crypto enthusiasts can be to bigger issues, and reminds me of the old adage “be careful what you wish for.”  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading, and host of the CoinDesk Markets Daily podcast. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m glad Javier Milei won, and if I were Argentinian, I would have voted for him (only reluctantly, with deep sadness, and because the “continuity” opponent Sergio Massa would have been even worse). Profound change is needed in Argentina, and I am eager to see the results of the radical economic experimentation Milei – an outspoken, libertarian economist – has been promising.  But three key things need to be kept in mind:  Milei is not as “pro-freedom” as many assume.  A lot of Argentines are going to have to endure significant economic hardship, even more than they currently do, as Milei slashes government spending through reducing benefits and subsidies. This is tragically necessary, and will hopefully bring growth on the other side. But let’s not gloat over what will be painful for millions.  Bitcoin is unlikely to be part of his political platform, at least not for the next few years. He has plenty of other things on his plate to worry about, not least the upcoming currency chaos and the whopping debt with the IMF.  Below, I’ll dive into more detail on the above.  But first, a positive takeaway from the results: the victory was quite spectacular. Milei won the highest percentage of the vote (almost 56%) since Juan Peron’s landslide victory in 1973. Opponent Sergio Massa (the current government’s now-former economy minister) called to concede even before the official results had been released.  The very loud message sent is one of a fed-up population, and it has plenty of reason to be, with annual inflation of over 140%, more than two out of every five people living below the poverty line, and one of the world’s worst-performing currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Voters made a brave call for change and risk rather than the comfortable “devil you know.” The Argentinian people have my deep respect for this, and I sincerely hope that Milei pulls off an economic miracle. At least he has a chance – the other guy didn’t.  Freedom?  But it’s going to be bumpy, both economically and socially. Milei promises “freedom” from the yoke of socialism and desperate governments trying to buy votes through wasteful and profligate spending. He is pro-free markets and pro-free trade. His rhetoric around “individual freedom” strikes a chord with an angry population. These are all freedoms that I can get behind, but we have to recognize they could come at the cost of other freedoms that many of us take for granted.  One is monetary independence. Milei ran on a campaign of dollarization, which at least will solve the foreign exchange crunch that is hampering even basic operations. But it will not necessarily bring the promised relief from inflation, and it will shackle the country to the conflicted monetary policy of a global superpower.  Another is reproductive rights – Milei is staunchly anti-abortion, and has vowed to launch a referendum to repeal a woman’s right to termination of an unwanted pregnancy before 14 weeks. He has also promised a “cultural battle” against socialism and feminism, which sounds… ominous?  Let’s not forget that Milei and his vice president Victoria Villarruel are far-right in political terms. Both have downplayed the atrocities committed during Argentina’s dictatorship, proposed dismantling the museum in memory of its victims, and stressed “zero tolerance” for crime. “Freedom” that only applies to those that agree with the government is not really freedom at all.  Growth?  It’s not clear from where the growth will come from. Milei has talked about cutting off all relations with its second-largest trading partner, China (he has called the Chinese “assassins”, which I guess makes “dictator” sound tame). He has also said that he will refuse to even talk to “communist” neighbors such as Brazil (Argentina’s largest trading partner), Colombia (the country’s fifth largest trading partner) and Chile, although the private sector can continue to transact.  And the currency chaos that would result from dollarization will most likely put a significant dent in the country’s revenue, at a time when the worst drought in six decades has slashed production of soy products, Argentina’s largest export.  Read more: Bitcoin Surpasses $37K on Argentina Presidential Election Result as Analysts Focus on Fed Notes  One international entity that should be happy is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Argentina is the IMF’s largest borrower by far, with more than double the outstanding debt of the second largest (Egypt). The Washington DC-based lender has been urging austerity, which Milei seems happy to try to deliver – but austerity hurts growth until finances are on a stronger footing. Necessary perhaps, but painful.  It’s also worth bearing in mind that Milei has virtually no leadership or even business experience, and has spent only a couple of years in Congress. He was a TV commentator and economics professor, neither of which even hints at an ability to manage teams let alone a country. And while we can appreciate the novelty of a president who has reportedly worked as a tantric sex guru and who enjoys cosplay, we’ve seen elsewhere what a carnival-like approach to governing can do to a country’s reputation – plus, it’s exhausting.  Bitcoin?  Finally, there’s no indication that bitcoin will be a part of Milei’s platform, at least not at first, and possibly not ever.  Milei has rarely, that I’ve been able to find, spoken publicly about bitcoin unless in answer to a direct question. He’s never sounded like an evangelist. He gives the impression of playing to his base by supporting the anti-system ethos. But we’re left with the idea that, for him, bitcoin is more a distraction than a tool.  Plus, Milei can’t afford to annoy the IMF, which really does not like the idea of bitcoin at all. Last year, the Argentine Senate accepted a $45 billion IMF loan that came with the condition of discouraging cryptocurrency use. The IMF has since recognized that attempting to ban bitcoin would be impractical. But it’s no fan.  This is not the win for bitcoin or for freedom that many think it is  Milei is possibly radical enough to tell the IMF to go stuff it – but if he is planning on dumping the only other sizeable international lender, China, that would be close to economic suicide.  One positive is that he is unlikely to try to stop the growing bitcoin interest in the country, and the prohibition on banks offering crypto services could be walked back. Earlier this year, the securities regulator approved bitcoin derivatives. Holders of bitcoin will have done very well – in Argentine peso terms, the price of BTC is up almost 400% over the past year.  But bitcoin is not going to become the currency standard of Argentina, and we are unlikely to hear Milei mention it again, other than when directly asked to. It’s a very different situation to El Salvador, which does have a president who sees bitcoin as a tool for freedom, and who is not so beholden to the IMF.  Nevertheless, bitcoin will do well from the changes that lie ahead for Argentina. Local interest in bitcoin is likely to continue growing, especially when savers are faced with even more currency turmoil and especially as inflation will take time to come back down.  Even more importantly, there is a chance that the potential prosperity of Argentina will be restored. The economic and social cost of runaway inflation would have led to intense and drawn-out misery under a government lacking the courage to take necessary measures. Milei does not seem to lack courage. And the economic experiment could end up providing a roadmap for other beleaguered nations eager to move past disastrous socialism.  I’m hopeful. I’m glad that Milei won. But this is not the win for bitcoin or for freedom that many think it is, and we need to be respectful of the pain that lies ahead for a truly beautiful country.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/11/20/argentinas-election-what-bitcoiners-are-getting-wrong,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b33aa198e7e362b159e52d5e3f7fb36d9860fd5c-1024x683.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Binance has been under a lengthy investigation by U.S. authorities for money laundering, bank fraud and violating U.S. sanctions laws, and the talks could reportedly conclude in the coming weeks.  A spokesperson with the DOJ declined to comment to CoinDesk. Binance didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  Binance and CZ have faced investigations and accusations on multiple fronts in the U.S., including related enforcement actions earlier this year from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. If the company agrees to be fined by the U.S. for more than $4 billion, that would represent one of the largest settlements in crypto history, but it's uncertain what other conditions or business requirements may come along with that penalty, according to Bloomberg.  Were U.S. authorities to charge CZ, a resident of the United Arab Emirates, with crimes, he would have to be extradited from a country with a U.S. extradition treaty or set foot in U.S. territory in order to face those charges.

20458413,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561522,1700499604,Shiba Inu Burn Rate Crashes 98.79% With Less Than 1 Million tokens Burned,"The majority of cryptocurrencies have started to turn green in terms of their price movement, which has led to Shiba Inu seeing gains of 2% over the past 24 hours. In spite of the modest increase in price, the SHIB burn rate seems to have taken a massive nosedive. According to the official SHIB burn tracker, Shibbburn, only 983,884 SHIB tokens were burned in the last 24 hours, representing a decline of over 99% from the previous day. A significant reduction of this kind in the burn rate is guaranteed to raise concerns from investors on the likelihood of downward pressure on SHIB’s price in the short term. SHIB Burn Rate Plummets 98.79% The primary purpose of the Shiba Inu burning is to reduce the amount of SHIB tokens in circulation, hence fostering scarcity and subsequently driving up the value of SHIB tokens in circulation. SHIB tokens are burned sporadically, with some days witnessing more token burn than others. For example, the first SHIB burn on Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution Shibarium amounted to 97 Million SHIB tokens. Related Reading: Argentina Welcomes First Pro-Bitcoin President, BTC Price Surges Above $37,000 According to the Shibburn website, a total of 983,884 SHIB tokens were burnt in the past 24 hours in three transactions, with the most being 42,850 SHIB tokens transferred to an inactive wallet. This figure translates to a 98.79% decrease in the number of tokens burned, a significant decline compared to the prior days. Source: Shibburn To put this into perspective, a total of 81.26 million SHIB tokens were burnt yesterday, and more than 49.76 million SHIB tokens were burnt two days ago. Implications For Shiba Inu Investors SHIB tokens can be burnt by any investor by sending tokens to any of the three SHIB burn addresses. According to the Shiba Inu community’s marketing lead, SHIB burns are a community effort. Data from the Shibburn website shows that more than 410 trillion SHIB tokens have been burnt from the initial supply. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $1.35 As These Metrics Heat Up This trend of the reduction in SHIB burn rate seems to have been going on for a while, as interest seems to be waning since the burn seems to have no effect on the price. As records from Shibburn show, October saw a decline of 37.12% in SHIB burns when compared to September. The burn rate performance slowed down throughout the month, despite the cryptocurrency’s price spiking more than 17% from its October bottom. SHIB is currently trading at $0.000008687, still up by 23.75% in the past 30 days. SHIB’s journey to $1 seems bleak at the moment, considering there are more than 589 trillion SHIB in circulation. SHIB burns will have to play an important part before the cryptocurrency can reach the $1 mark as they will help to decrease the total supply.

20456469,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561612,1700496047,Bitcoin ETF Hype: Bloomberg Intelligence Envisions $100 Billion Market With Regulatory Approval,"As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its upward trajectory toward $38,000, the long-awaited arrival of a US spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could open the floodgates of digital currency investing for institutional and retail investors. Notably, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates that the potential spot Bitcoin ETF market could reach a staggering $100 billion, signaling a breakthrough for cryptocurrencies on Wall Street. Inquiries Surge As Spot Bitcoin ETF Looms The anticipation surrounding Bitcoin ETFs stems from the expected regulatory approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). After a decade of rejecting various applications, the SEC is on track to green-light ETFs that will enable the buying and selling Bitcoin within a tax-efficient and cost-effective framework. This pivotal regulatory shift has sparked optimism among digital asset proponents, who see this as a redemption opportunity following the industry’s recent challenges. Respected heavyweights such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco are expected to participate in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. Collaborations like the one between Galaxy Digital Holdings and Invesco further emphasize the growing interest from reputable financial institutions. Related Reading: Altcoin Corrections Signal Strong Buy Opportunities: Crypto Analyst On this matter, Galaxy Digital recently hosted a conference call attended by approximately 300 investment professionals, discussing strategies for allocating investments to Bitcoin in anticipation of the ETF debut. According to Bloomberg, wealth managers and financial advisers are increasingly intrigued by the potential of Bitcoin ETFs. Professionals like Jeff Janson at Summit Wealth have received inquiries from investors of all ages, indicating a growing appetite for digital assets in portfolios. Coinbase suggests that ETFs will attract immediate inflows and reshape the market through fresh lending and derivatives trades. However, it is important to note that this transformation will take time to unfold fully. The imminent launch of Bitcoin ETFs represents a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency industry, potentially catapulting it into the mainstream financial landscape. As estimated by Bloomberg Intelligence, the projected $100 billion market for spot Bitcoin ETF underscores the growing confidence and widespread interest among investors. BTC’s Dominance Unshaken According to a recent report by CoinShares, Bitcoin has maintained its dominance in the cryptocurrency market, experiencing a notable inflow of $155 million. This surge in investment comes as the last eight weeks of inflows alone account for approximately 3.4% of the total assets under management. Related Reading: Solana DEX Trading Volume Spikes 54% In The Last Week, TVL Climbs Interestingly, while Bitcoin saw substantial inflows, there were outflows of approximately $8.5 million from short-Bitcoin positions the previous week. This suggests that investors are increasingly optimistic about BTC’s future and its potential for further growth. In line with the above, the report suggests that this positive BTC sentiment is closely linked to the expected approval of a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at $37,100, up 1.7% in the past 24 hours, with expectations that the largest cryptocurrency on the market can once again break through the $38,000 mark and consolidate above it to target the $40,000 mark. However, it remains to be seen whether the SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs will be the main catalyst for further gains in the coming months or whether a rejection could cause BTC to test investor confidence and lower support levels.

42409448,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHPeR,1700495922,Celsius Revamp Plan Hits Speed Bump With SEC: Source,"An ambitious plan to form a new crypto services business from the ashes of bankrupt lender Celsius has run into a speed bump with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a person familiar with the situation.  A ""back and forth"" regarding information around assets held by the Celsius estate is taking place between the SEC, the Celsius Creditors Committee and Fahrenheit, an investment vehicle that won a bidding contest in May of this year to issue shares in a new crypto business built upon the bankrupt lender's remaining assets, the source told CoinDesk.  ""My understanding is that [the SEC] asked for more information to make a determination,"" the person said. ""The way I'm interpreting it is the SEC is telling the committee what they want to see for various parts of the business, and now the committee has to decide what they're going to do with that information.""  Investment vehicle Fahrenheit, which includes Arrington Capital, U.S. Bitcoin Corp., and Proof Group, gained approval for its reorganization plan from a bankruptcy court earlier this month.  Fahrenheit's now-stalled plan for Celsius involved distributing some $2 billion worth of bitcoin [BTC] and Ethereum's ether [ETH] to creditors, as well as equity in a new company. The new entity would run and further build out the Celsius bitcoin mining operations, stake Ethereum, monetize other illiquid assets and develop new business opportunities, according to a filing.  The approved backup plan if that falls through: winding down and liquidating Celsius' assets.  Neither Fahrenheit nor the Celsius Creditor Committee responded to requests for comment.

Bitcoin's recent rally has made it easier for trend-followers, but the vast majority of gains were achieved by three big green weekly candles over the course of this year. A final surge towards the 61.8% retracement around USD 48,000 to 50,000 remains likely. Afterwards a deep pullback is expected. From its November 2022 low to its recent high, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( OTC:GBTC ) is up 145% within 12 months. But of course, it wasn’t easy to ride this rally if you didn’t have a good entry or are a long-term holder. Until the summer top, Bitcoins recovery was primarily driven by three big weekly candles. If you were not invested, you missed those and were running behind the train. Only the most recent rally which started in mid of October made it a bit easier for trend-followers. However, Bitcoin is now consolidating this surge. Review With a low at USD 24,920, the nine-and-a-half-week summer correction (-25%) for Bitcoin concluded on September 11th. Since then, the allure of all the to be approved Spot-ETFs has propelled Bitcoin prices gradually upwards, gaining momentum notably from mid-October. The pinnacle was reached at USD 37,978 on November 9th, surpassing our third target of USD 35,924 given back in January. However, over the past nine days, Bitcoin has become entrenched around the USD 38,000 resistance mark, with negative divergences intensifying on smaller timeframes. Despite the overbought conditions, will a breakthrough towards our fourth target at USD 48,555 be achieved, or is a healthy yet larger retracement necessary following the robust rally in recent weeks? Performance in USD since the beginning of the year, as of November 18, 2023. (TradingView) Regardless, Bitcoin remains significantly ahead on an annual basis, boasting a gain of 119.71%, making it by far the best performer. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has seen an increase of 61.39%, while the S&P500 ( SP500 ) and the German DAX ( DAX:IND ) lag far behind at 18% and 12.86%, respectively. Comparatively disappointing is the performance of precious metals. Although gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) has posted a respectable gain of 7.67% since the start of the year, silver ( XAGUSD:CUR ) , in contrast, has slipped into negative territory at -1.17%. Solana is up 750% from its bear-market low Solana in USD, weekly chart as of November 18th, 2023. (TradingView) The surge in major altcoins like Solana ( SOL-USD ) over the past four weeks serves as an emancipating blow and a cautionary signal at the same time. What is needed, in addition to a potential ascent of Bitcoin to around USD 50,000, is a brief yet sharp price explosion in smaller altcoins. This would complete the list of ingredients for a significant interim top in the sector. Following the FTX debacle, Solana underwent an extended and arduous phase of base formation. Since the final low on December 26th, 2023, at USD 8, the coin has experienced a spectacular recovery of over 750%, reaching USD 68. However, a Delaware bankruptcy court has approved the sale of assets from the bankrupt FTX exchange to compensate creditors, including 55.75 million SOL, which are poised to be thrown at the market, at least to some extent. Overall, the recovery in Bitcoin and altcoins, along with the stock markets, is likely to persist until the end of the year. However, we suspect that the dynamics will be reshuffled in the early weeks of January, presenting investors in these sectors with a challenging 2024. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart – At the 38.2% Retracement of the Bear Market Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of November 18th, 2023. (TradingView) Over the past 12 months, Bitcoin has significantly rebounded from its nosedive (-77.57%), recovering slightly more than 38.2% of the bear market. The classic 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement represents the minimum response to a preceding price movement. In other words, Bitcoin is alive, but there is still a considerable journey ahead until it reaches its all-time high at USD 69,000! Since the low on November 21st, 2022, there has been an impressive recovery of around 145%. However, compared to previous recoveries, this one appears relatively modest. Nevertheless, when juxtaposed with stock markets and precious metals, Bitcoin’s recovery unmistakably outshines all other sectors, proving to be both clear and spectacular. Next target approx. USD 48,500 to USD 50,000 The next plausible price target would be the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement at USD 48,555. Given the overbought conditions on the weekly chart, a direct surge to that level would indeed be a formidable undertaking. Nevertheless, considering the current enthusiasm surrounding Bitcoin ETFs, a continuation of the rally, more or less directly, must be accorded a significantly elevated probability. In summary, the weekly chart remains bullish as long as Bitcoin can defend its breakout above USD 31,800. A multi-week breather between approximately USD 35,000 and USD 38,000 could serve as a launching pad towards USD 48,000 to USD 50,000. However, an ascent beyond USD 50,000 in the next six to twelve months is deemed highly improbable. Instead, a more substantial correction wave, stemming from the 61.8% Retracement, could offer considerably more favorable entry points later in the course of 2024. Daily Chart – Consolidation at Elevated Levels Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of November 18th, 2023. (TradingView) Regarding price, we were briefly too pessimistic in mid-September. However, we accurately anticipated the end of the summer correction by mid-October. Initiating from a final dip down to USD 26,500 on October 11th, the seasonally typical autumn rally swiftly propelled Bitcoin upwards by 43% within a few weeks. For approximately the past 10 days, this impressive surge has been consolidating at elevated levels, with increasingly negative divergences appearing on smaller timeframes. The lower Bollinger Band (USD 33,929) must also catch up with the current price action. Hence, short-term consolidation between USD 35,000 and USD 38,000 is the most probable scenario. While Bitcoin consolidates at a high level, the daily chart remains neutral. A pullback towards USD 35,000 and slightly lower should be anticipated. This would provide an opportunity for the bulls to regroup, potentially setting the stage for a resumption of the rally in December. Sentiment Bitcoin – Sentiment is slightly fearful. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of November 17th, 2023. (Lookintobitcoin) The “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” currently stands at 63 out of 100 points, reflecting an elevated level of optimism within the cryptocurrency sector. Typically, the vigor of the initial recovery wave after a bear market is insufficient to ignite total euphoria and greed in the crypto sector. The year 2019 serves as a clear illustration of this. Following a steep recovery to the 61.8% retracement level at USD 13,800, the bulls ran out of steam. Despite the impressive rally in the summer of 2019, extreme optimism levels were not attained. Subsequently, a substantial pullback ensued, culminating in a double bottom at USD 3,800 during the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. Overall, the sentiment appears somewhat excessively optimistic, yet there is room for further ascent towards absolute greed. Seasonality Bitcoin – Favorable seasonality until early January Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of November 17th, 2023. (Seasonax) As anticipated, Bitcoin indeed found a significant low between mid-September and mid-October, experiencing a robust uptrend since then. Seasonality remains bullish until early January, thereby supporting the envisaged rally to the 61.8% retracement level or around USD 48,000 to USD 50,000. Subsequently, and statistically speaking, a multi-month period of consolidation or correction is expected towards spring 2024. In summary, seasonality remains bullish until early January. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of September 3rd, 2023. (TradingView) Over the past twelve months, Bitcoin has notably outperformed the price of gold by a substantial margin, achieving a remarkable 116% gain. With Bitcoin trading at approximately USD 36,400 per unit and gold at USD 1,980 per ounce, the current exchange rate requires an expenditure of about 18.34 ounces of gold for a single Bitcoin. Conversely, this implies that one ounce of gold is currently valued at approximately 0.054 Bitcoin. In aggregate, since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin has unquestionably proven to be the swifter contender with a surge of +119.71%, surpassing the performance of gold (+7.67%) by a factor of 15.6. With the current value standing at 18.3, the Bitcoin/Gold ratio has nearly breached the resistance zone between 17 and 18. However, the 38.2% retracement at 20 has not been reached yet. We anticipate that this achievement is merely a matter of time. In the subsequent phase, an ascent to around 23 would be anticipated. This level encompasses both the 50% retracement and the subsequent resistance zone. Macro Update – A severe and global recession is foreseeable. US Inflation Figures as of November 14th, 2023. (Holger Zschaepitz) In the past three weeks, the American stock index S&P 500 has rebounded by over 10%, reaching its highest level since early August. This rally was propelled, among other factors, by the consumer price inflation, which dropped to 3.2% in October, and a staggering 0.5% decline in US producer prices. This outcome undercut the Wall Street consensus, catching many pessimistic market participants off guard. Following the inflation data, 10-year US bonds fell to 4.43%, as no further interest rate hikes are expected in December. Consequently, the US dollar and yields plummeted. The year-end rally is already in full swing. Illusion and Truth China’s Nominal GDP Growth in USD as of November 15th, 2023. (Holger Zschaepitz) However, the fundamental data paint a very different and grim picture. A few highlights include: US retail sales have declined for the first time in seven months. Delinquent commercial real estate loans at US banks have reached the highest level in a decade. The number of applications for unemployment benefits in the US has risen for eight consecutive weeks to the highest level in almost two years. Delinquencies on auto loans from US subprime borrowers reached a nearly 30-year high in September, hitting 6.1%, the highest rate since 1994. Citi Bank is commencing the first round of mass layoffs next Monday, with tens of thousands of employees expected to be let go. Prices for the eight major shipping routes have fallen by half this year, from USD 3,000 per container to just USD 1,400. China’s GDP has nominally shrunk in USD terms, making the Chinese economy challenging for foreign investors, not only due to geopolitical tensions. Out of approximately USD 175 billion in Chinese real estate bonds, bonds worth USD 124.5 billion are currently in default. US banks are at an all-time low compared to the S&P 500. An unprecedented contraction in money supply US M2 Money Supply. (Bureau of Economic Analysis, National Bureau of Economic Research, Game of Trades.) Rising insolvencies, plummeting revenues, mass layoffs, a sharp decline in container prices in shipping and freight, an unprecedented contraction in money supply, and worldwide hesitancy in spending collectively signal a looming recession. Increasing macroeconomic factors support this outlook. While monetary tightening (“Quantitative Tightening”) intensifies and the sharply increased interest rates gradually affect the economy and society, the threat of deflation, not inflation, looms in many areas! In short, the planet is on the verge of a brutal global recession. In 2023, US government has borrowed more than 3x the 2008 bailout package This will force the Fed to significantly lower interest rates in the next 6 to 24 months. Simultaneously, the US government’s debt has surged by USD 2.5 trillion within a year, from USD 31.2 trillion to USD 33.7 trillion. Just this year alone, the US government has borrowed more than triple the amount of the 2008 bailout package to finance its deficits. The fiscal stimuli from the Biden administration, which had kept the markets and the US economy somewhat afloat this year, are expiring and are likely to be viewed in retrospect as a flash in the pan. In the short term, all of this is likely to weaken the US dollar and initially support the recovery in Bitcoin and the stock markets. Nevertheless, it must be assumed that massive problems for the world economy and hence global financial markets will roll in as early as the first quarter of 2024. For Bitcoin, this does not bode well until the interest rate turnaround. The timing and speed of the Fed’s reversal are uncertain. Only when the money printing machine is restarted is Bitcoin likely to launch an attack on its all-time high. Until then, a tumultuous rollercoaster ride is on the horizon. Conclusion: Bitcoin – Taking a breath before the next surge After the steep rally since mid-October, optimism and, in some cases, euphoria are gaining ground in the crypto sector. However, in the grand scheme, not much has happened beyond a recovery slightly above the 38.2% retracement (USD 35,924). The hype around Bitcoin ETFs and a typically positive year-end could potentially bring a final surge to around USD 48,000 to USD 50,000 after the current breather. Such a spike could unfold in a matter of weeks. Should Bitcoin fail to achieve this and experience a larger pullback directly or sooner, one would currently need to consider an established high and a more significant correction below USD 31,800. Historically, Bitcoin has typically concluded its bear markets with a double bottom. Prices below USD 20,000 seem distant at the moment and would likely only be expected in a global liquidity crisis. However, the necessary ingredients for a worldwide deflationary shock are already on the table. Predicting exactly when it will occur is currently challenging. Nevertheless, from the first quarter of 2024 onward, we would be much more cautious and significantly increase the liquidity ratio.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653117-bitcoin-taking-breath-before-next-surge?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20454992.jpeg

20454506,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561546,1700492409,Sam Altman’s Worldcoin Token Makes Headlines With 24% Surge Amid OpenAI Drama,"The narrative around Sam Altman and OpenAI seems to have had a major impact on the value of WLD, the token that Worldcoin, a cryptocurrency that Altman co-founded, is issuing. As the drama surrounding Sam Altman’s dismissal from OpenAI and possible reinstatement continues to captivate the crypto space, the Worldcoin digital token has been one of the most unpredictable in the cryptocurrency market as of late. As of today, the trading price of Worldcoin (WLD) has reached $2.43, indicating that the cryptocurrency has made a strong recovery. In comparison to the previous 24 hours, this is a significant gain of 19%, with an impressive 24% rally in the last week, data from crypto price aggregator Coingecko shows. Worldcoin’s Unpredictable Market Behavior Amid Altman’s Controversy From a high of $2.50 on November 16, WLD started to weaken as digital asset markets backpedaled the next day, with Altman’s dismissal only making the decline worse. In the hours following his departure, the token dipped to $1.85 according to statistics compiled by CoinGecko. Source: Coingecko As artificial intelligence (AI) develops at a rapid pace, Worldcoin is working on a digital identity network that will collect retina scans to verify users’ identities. Related Reading: Kaspa Binance Listing Sparks Frenzy: 50% Price Surge Captures Investors’ Interest The project’s orbs collect users’ retina scans, and in return, they give users WLD tokens as a compensation for giving their biometric data. Events at OpenAI, which Altman acted as a go-between for Worldcoin and, by extension, WLD, continue to impact WLD price, even though the two projects are unrelated. With a market value of approximately $280 million, the token holds the 160th position in the crypto market, as reported by CoinGecko on Monday. Total crypto market cap is currently at $1.3 trillion. Chart: TradingView.com The surge in the token’s value is intricately linked to the news surrounding Altman and the uncertainties arising from his removal at OpenAI, according to Richard Galvin, co-founder at Digital Asset Capital Management. Altman As The Face Of Worldcoin: Impact On Investor Appeal As events unfolded, the token experienced a rebound, gaining momentum as it became evident that there was no significant negative event fueling the board’s decision. Digital asset platform VDX’s head of research in Hong Kong, Greta Yuan, predicted that WLD will experience additional volatility in the coming weeks. Altman is the face of Worldcoin, so depending on how this drama plays out in the next few days, the token may fluctuate, but its appeal to investors will not diminish, Yuan said. Related Reading: Unleashing The Bull: The Astonishing 400% Rise Of An AI Crypto – Details Meanwhile, even though OpenAI’s stock dropped to $2.04 over the weekend after the announcement of Altman’s resignation as chief executive, the company’s efforts to reassign his role as CEO helped propel the stock back up.

The previous halving in May 2020 led to Bitcoin reaching its all-time high of $68,790 in November 2021. The monthly chart highlights the significant gains and subsequent drop in Bitcoin's price during the last bull market. If the past trends repeat, Bitcoin is poised for a large move that could last through most of 2025. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is months away from the next halving which is expected to be around April 17, 2024. The halving events have historically resulted in strong price appreciation for Bitcoin and alt coins. While there is no guarantee that strong price appreciation will occur this time, Bitcoin is set up for a strong move higher over the next year and possibly through most of 2025 on a technical basis. The last Bitcoin halving event in May 2020 resulted in the crypto coin reaching its all-time high of 68,790 in November 2021. This was a significant gain over the low of $3,850 from March 2020. The low point for Bitcoin was probably driven down further by the COVID-19 black swan event in 2020. The price of Bitcoin at the May 2020 halving was $8,590. Previous halvings also resulted in significant price appreciation for Bitcoin. The first halving drove the price from $12.40 to $1,170 from December 2012 to July 2016. The second halving drove the price from $535 to $19,400 from August 2016 to December 2017. Of course, these large gains were followed by sharp bear markets after the peaks were reached. I find that using the monthly chart can help investors/traders enter and exit Bitcoin to capture and lock in the significant gains that are driven by the halving events. Bitcoin's Monthly Chart Bitcoin's Monthly Chart w/ MACD & RSI (tradingview.com) The monthly chart (each candle represents an entire month) above shows how significant the last bull market was from 2020 through November 2021. We can also see how drastic the drop was after the double top from November 2021 to December 2022. Since such large fluctuations exist in the price of Bitcoin, a viable strategy could be to trade in and out of the crypto coin to maximize earnings over time. Historically, buying before or around the halving events have been good entry points. The exit points for profit-taking can be when the purple RSI line (bottom of the chart) moves past 90 as indicated by the green overbought zone. The buy zones on the chart can be when the MACD histogram lines (middle of the chart) turn from red to pink and when the RSI moves below the 50 midpoint and begins to turn up. Some investors/traders may be more comfortable buying when the MACD histogram shows its first or second green bar and when the blue MACD line crosses above the red signal line. If you decide to go with the more aggressive early point when the MACD histogram shifts from red to pink bars, a dollar cost averaging in strategy might be best. This would have traders entering Bitcoin in the 4th quarter of 2022 before the large move higher in 2023. Then, a scaling out strategy could be used to take profits beginning when the RSI moves into the overbought zone and when the MACD histogram bars turn from dark green to light green. Then, completely exit the position when the blue MACD line crosses below the red signal line (when the red bars in the histogram begin to appear). The rise in the price of Bitcoin in 2023 was likely the result of optimism regarding the anticipated approval of Bitcoin ETFs. This price action could actually be a buy the rumor, sell the news type of event. The Bitcoin price did increase from below $16,000 and rose to a recent price above $38,000. So, if the actual news of a Bitcoin ETF approval does take place, it could result in a sell-the-news reaction. That will lead me to the weekly price chart. Bitcoin's Weekly Chart Bitcoin Weekly Chart w/ MACD & RSI (tradingview.com) I zoomed in a bit on Bitcoin's weekly chart where each candle represents an entire week. We can see that the purple RSI line recently crossed into overbought territory. It appears that it might be dropping from this level as the price fell from above $38,000 to below $37,000. It is possible that the price will continue to rally in the overbought area on the weekly chart until the news of a Bitcoin approval occurs. With the price already overbought, the reaction from traders could be to lock in profits from the 2023 gains, leading to a near-term sell-the-news reaction. Profit-taking could occur any time now that the price is in overbought territory. Bitcoin's Daily Chart Bitcoin's Daily Chart w/ MACD & RSI (tradingview.com) I included Bitcoin's daily chart above to get a shorter-term perspective. The daily chart shows how the stock recently dropped from an overbought condition according to the RSI indicator. The daily chart is in a downtrend as the blue MACD line crosses below the red signal line. Investors should wait to see if the price can hold above the 50 level on the RSI. That would be bullish. However, a drop below the 50 level would be bearish and could drive the price to an oversold level which occurred in August. So, will wait to see how the near-term price action goes before deciding to jump back in. The Bottom Line on Bitcoin The halving event which is estimated to be in April 2024 is expected to result in a new high price for Bitcoin which could occur within about 18 months of the halving based on past performance . If the future price action follows the past price action after halvings, then I would guess that Bitcoin would rally to a deep overbought level on the RSI on the monthly chart. This could take the price to new highs. Of course, there is no guarantee that this will occur. Price predictions for the post-2024 halving vary greatly. Some experts think the halving is already priced in, while others are projecting Bitcoin to reach anywhere from $60,000 to $250,000 within about 18 months of the halving. That would take us to about October 2025. These price predictions vary based on the analysts doing the estimating. Based on the long-term technical analysis and past behavior, I would estimate that the price does go higher than the previous high. This would be in line with previous sentiment and price action. The last bull market took the price about 18x higher than the COVID low in March 2020. COVID probably drove the price down to an exaggerated level. So, I would estimate a 10x move for Bitcoin over the 52-week low of $15,480. This would take the price to $154,800 by October 2025. The risk is that Bitcoin's past sentiment-driven demand may not repeat in the future. Bitcoin depends on demand-driven sentiment to move the price higher. So, if for some reason investor sentiment changes to negative in the long term, Bitcoin could lose all of its value. Therefore, Bitcoin should be considered a speculative investment. In that case, investors/traders should only put an amount of money into Bitcoin that they can afford to lose.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4653102-bitcoin-multiple-time-frame-price-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/20453819.jpeg

If the predictions are anything to go by, then the price of Bitcoin is at one of the lowest points it’ll ever be in the next seven years. Very Bullish For Bitcoin Price In The Short Term The predictions from the machine learning algorithm for the Bitcoin price, especially in the short term, are very bullish. These predictions ranging between five days and one month show where the algorithm expects the price to be in these time frames and they are a long way away from the current price levels. Related Reading: Cardano Founder Courts OpenAI’s Sam Altman – What Does He Want To Build? On the 5-day prediction, the machine learning algorithm is showing a rather outrageous price, predicting that the price will rise approximately 50% from here. The 5-day price target is placed at $55,661, and taking into account the current Bitcoin price of just under $31,200 at the time of this writing, it will mean that BTC would have to jump 49.65% in less than a week. Source: CoinCodex The prediction on the one-month timeframe is, however, much more realistic at $43,760. This translates to a $17.66% rally taking the current price into account, and an almost $7,000 increase in value for the pioneer cryptocurrency. Looking Over The Long Term Prediction For BTC On the much longer timeframes, the algorithm shows much more bullishness for Bitcoin. For example, in 2024, which is less than two months away, it predicts that the Bitcoin price will run as high as $109,364, with a yearly low of $29,564, which is the lowest it expects the asset’s price to be in the next seven years. Between the years 2025 and 2026, it expects BTC to peak above $100,000 with a bottom yearly range of $62,757. Interestingly, in 2027, the algorithm does not expect much deviation between the yearly low and high, putting the former at $78,443 and the latter at $78,522. Related Reading: Ethereum Whistleblower Reveals When Proof Of ETH Founders’ Fraud Will Be Released In 2029, the CoinCodex machine learning algorithm expects the Bitcoin price to finally cross the sought-after $300,000 level. In this year, the yearly low moves up significantly to $126,318 and the yearly high is placed at $305,028. Fast forward to 2030 and the bullishness is maintained with an expected yearly low of $141,562. The predicted yearly high for 2030 is lower than that of 2029 but still significant at a value of $266,676. The high figures projected for the Bitcoin price are not without merit as the website identifies that there are more bullish signals flashing now than bearish signals. Out of a total of 30 signals analyzed, 27 were found to be bullish with only 3 bearish signals.

The new unit, Luxor Logistics, will focus heavily on streamlining complex customs regulations in different regions by customizing transportation and delivery services, lowering the time required for shipping mining rigs for miners. ""With the variety of import/export regulatory demands across different regions, Luxor positioned itself as a knowledgeable and valuable partner, helping miners to navigate the complex landscape of customs and documentation,"" Lauren Lin, Luxor's director of business development, told CoinDesk in a statement.  The formation of the new venture - an extension of Luxor's mining machine trading business - comes as lowering the logistical challenges is critical for miners to stay competitive in the current market. Miners need to be operational with the most efficient machines as quickly as possible to remain profitable ahead of next year's bitcoin halving - which will cut mining rewards by half. Combined with subdued bitcoin price, record high hashrate of the network and regulatory scrutiny, geographical diversification has also become crucial for miners.  ""The service's expertise in navigating diverse global shipping challenges positions miners to swiftly adapt to changing market conditions and expand into different countries, maximizing their efficiency and competitiveness during this critical period,"" Lin said.  Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive  The new business, however, is not the first of its kind. Last year, digital-asset mining and staking firm Foundry also started a similar service to make the delivery of bitcoin-mining computers more efficient. Foundry is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), the parent company of CoinDesk.  Luxor aims to set itself apart from the competition by emphasizing on its expertise of global shipping, using the U.S. as its home base. The firm said it has already completed shipping over $245 million worth of equipment to more than 30 countries.  ""This extensive experience not only allows Luxor to secure competitive shipping rates but also positions the company to offer its wealth of industry knowledge and expertise to clients so that they can benefit from a seamless integration of global shipping solutions with preferential rates under Luxor ASIC Trading Desk,"" according to Lin.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  The next president of Argentina will be Javier Milei after his opponent Sergio Massa conceded on Sunday evening, saying ""Argentines chose another path."" With roughly 87% of the votes counted, Milei had 56% of the tally versus Massa's 44%, according to Bloomberg. Trading quietly through most of the weekend, bitcoin began rising late Sunday afternoon on chatter about a strong showing for Milei. Following Massa's concession, the crypto is higher by around 2% over 24 hours at $37,150. ""We have to understand that the central bank is a scam,"" Milei said earlier this year when asked about bitcoin. ""What bitcoin is representing,"" he continued, ""is the return of money to its original creator, the private sector.""  Sam Altman, the former CEO of OpenAI, Greg Brockman, the company's co-founder and ex-president, and other former staff members will be joining Microsoft, the software giant's CEO Satya Nadella said in a post on X. Altman left OpenAI last week after the board said it no longer had confidence in him to continue leading the company. Brockman announced his resignation shortly after Altman was ousted. Altman will lead a new advanced AI research team, Nadella said.  Santander Private Banking International, part of Spanish financial services giant Banco Santander, is offering high-net-worth clients with Swiss accounts trading and investing in the major cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ether, according to an internal announcement seen by CoinDesk. Over the next several months, Santander will offer additional cryptocurrencies that meet the bank’s screening criteria, the announcement said. Santander said the service is provided only upon client request through relationship managers, and the assets are held in a regulated custody model in which the bank stores the private cryptographic keys in a secure environment.

20450555,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561526,1700485216,"Solana DEX Trading Volume Spikes 54% In The Last Week, TVL Climbs","Solana has recorded a massive surge in trading volume on two decentralized exchanges, Raydium and Orca, in the last seven days. According to data, this dramatic surge birthed a 42% increase in SOL’s Total Value Locked (TVL). SOL’s price also reacted to this increased interest, scoring notable gains in the last week and rising above $60 to a high of $67.69 on November 15. Solana’s DEX Volume Spikes 54% in a Week. Data from DeFiLlama showed a 54% increase in Solana’s trading volume on decentralized exchanges (DEX). According to the data, the total trading volume surpassed $3.01 billion, a new high in the SOL ecosystem. Related Reading: Argentina Welcomes First Pro-Bitcoin President, BTC Price Surges Above $37,000 SOL trading volume on the two top decentralized exchanges, Orca and Raydium, increased 45.7% and 47.79%, respectively, totaling 95.49% in one week. More so, Orca’s utility token reacted to this massive spike in trading volume, surging nearly 20%. Following this development, SOL TVL spiked 42% from $409.68 million on November 1 to $584.56 million on Monday, November 20. This development secured Solana among the top three chains in weekly transaction volume, after Ethereum ($9.97 billion) and Arbitrum ($4.49 billion). SOL Soars Amid Spike In Ecosystem Activity Apart from the notable 7-day increase in trading volume, Solana has performed remarkably well in the last 30 days. SOL has recorded an impressive 125% 30-day price gain. Amid this frenzy, prominent crypto investor and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood expressed optimism about Solana’s potential growth. During a November 15 CNBC interview, she praised the Solana Blockchain for its speed and efficiency. As a result of Wood’s bullish sentiment, SOL price soared even higher, scoring 20% within a day. However, although SOL capitalized on these positive changes to soar above $60, its rally has stalled. After an erratic price surge to $67.69 on November 15, SOL’s price dipped to $55 on November 17. Its price now stands at $60.66, with a 24-hour price increase of 1.49%. But despite the minor price gains in the last 24 hours, SOL retains over 5% of its past week’s gains. Solana Price Outlook The chart below shows that Solana (SOL) has broken out from a bearish trendline and has formed a new one. After trading between the $18 and $20 ranges for several weeks, SOL broke through a critical resistance at $23 in mid-October. And since then, the token has been unstoppable. SOL continued soaring, breaking another significant resistance at the $42 price level and exceeding $60 on November 15. Although the bears have fought to suppress SOL’s strides, the token is still significantly above two simple moving averages ($24.59 and $36.25).

20448518,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561493,1700481609,Altcoin Corrections Signal Strong Buy Opportunities: Crypto Analyst,"In a recent analysis shared on X (formerly Twitter), crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe offered an insightful perspective on the current state of the altcoin market. His analysis draws parallels with historical trends, suggesting that the current corrections in altcoins may present strong buying opportunities for investors. Buy The Altcoin Dips Now? Van de Poppe’s analysis began by noting the ongoing corrections in the altcoin sector, which he interprets as part of a sustained uptrend. “Altcoins have multiple days/weeks correction while still in an uptrend,” he stated, indicating that these periods are not only natural but also beneficial for the market’s overall health. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Projects $7 Trillion Market Cap For Altcoins – Here’s When He further explained the dynamics of these corrections, emphasizing their historical significance. “This [current] period is very heavily comparable to the period we experienced at the end of 2015, or at the end of 2019,” van de Poppe mentioned. He drew specific attention to Ethereum’s remarkable run from $1 to $14 in late 2015, which eventually led to a peak of $1,400 in 2017, demonstrating the potential for massive returns. Van de Poppe’s analysis also touched upon the concept of higher timeframe support zones. He elucidated that during initial upward runs, corrections to these support zones offer ideal re-entry points for investors. “During the run in 2020, we’ve seen the DeFi summer taking place, which has a high chance of coming back to the surface in 2024,” he added, hinting at a potential bull run in the coming months. A significant part of his analysis involved a detailed comparison between Ethereum’s price action and that of other altcoins like Chainlink and Arbitrum. He noted, “If you compare the price action of Ethereum with the current price action of Chainlink, you’ll see that it’s just barely having a correction of 20%.” He suggested that further corrections could provide even clearer trends and entry points for investors. Related Reading: Ethereum Breakout: Analyst Explains Why The King Of The Altcoins Is Destined For $10,000 Van de Poppe also emphasized the importance of time frames in analyzing these trends. “If you start to zoom in on the 1h, or 4h, or 15m timeframe, you’ll spot those trends as well. It’s just a matter of time frame,” he explained. Chainlink And Arbitrum Entry Zones Looking at the LINK/USD 1-day chart, van der Poppe remarked, “Arguments can be made that we’re barely at the start of this first upwards wave of the cycle as this rally of Chainlink lasted less than 5 weeks.” As the crypto analyst shows, Chainlink has already undergone a correction of -21.7%. According to him, there are two points of interest for a possible entry, in the range from $12.54 to $13.18 and around $11.62. “Another example is Arbitrum, which is currently resting on support and, just like the rest of the markets, is providing a corrective move,” stated van der Poppe. The analyst identifies a “clear range support” at $0.98 in the 1-day chart of ARB/USD. In conclusion, Michaël van de Poppe’s analysis presents a compelling case for considering altcoin corrections as potential opportunities for investment. His concluding advice to investors is “Don’t be afraid, if an altcoin drops between 30-50% at this stage of the cycle, time to look for your entries.” At press time, the total altcoin market cap stood at $169.264 billion, just below the crucial 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level of $169.928 billion. A break above this resistance could be a major bullish signal.

The artificial intelligence (AI) focused token sector added over 8% amid key, but unrelated, developments in rising AI upstarts.  However, some traders warn of a market reaction after Federal Reserve meeting notes are released Tuesday, ahead of an expected low-liquidity environment toward the end of this working week.  Bitcoin [BTC] rose through $37,000 early Monday as Argentina's presidential election was won by Javier Milei, a pro-bitcoin candidate. The broader crypto market added almost 2% in the past 24 hours.  Milei, a self-described anarcho-capitalist, has been supportive of bitcoin, calling it ""the return of money to its original creator, the private sector."" He has not, however, proposed making the world's largest cryptocurrency legal tender in the country.  The artificial intelligence (AI) token sector also gained, adding over 8% amid key, but unrelated, developments in rising AI upstarts. Bittensor's TAO rose 4.2%, adding to a 77% rally over the past week. Ocean Protocol's OCEAN, Fetch AI's FET and SingularityNet's AGIX zoomed as much as 16% in the past 24 hours, outperforming bitcoin and other majors.  Near Protocol’s NEAR jumped 20% and staking platform Lido’s LDO added 11%.  A potentially busy week is coming up for crypto, with several events and announcements that could drive market movements, some traders said.  ""Tomorrow the U.S. Federal Reserve releases its latest meeting notes, which have a tendency to move markets,"" eToro markets analyst Simon Peters said in a note to CoinDesk. ""These minutes give deeper insight into central bank thinking. With inflation slowing, investors are looking for more confirmation that we may be at peak rates.""  ""Also on Tuesday, Nvidia is reporting its latest results. The firm has become a poster child for the AI revolution as the 'picks and shovels' play for investors. Cryptoassets are likely to be responsive to the firm’s announcements,"" Peters said.  Peters also warned of low liquidity toward the end of the week as U.S. financial markets close Thursday for Thanksgiving and Black Friday kicks off the holiday shopping season. Thin trading volumes can create volatility in markets.  FxPro analyst Alex Kuptsikevich said that while traders expect the Federal Reserve to announce rate cuts in the coming months, such a move could occur only if financial markets were to first take a deep hit.  ""The Fed typically starts a cycle of rate cuts only after a significant market correction starts, on the back of damaged risk appetite,"" Kuptsikevich wrote in a note on Monday. ""A cut in the first half of 2024 can only be triggered by severe turbulence in debt and equity market.""  A drop in broader markets could, however, mean bitcoin ""returns below $30,000 before triggering another bull cycle,"" Kuptsikevich said.",POSITIVE,BTC | NEAR,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING | NEAR,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/11/20/bitcoin-surpasses-37k-on-argentina-presidential-election-result-as-analysts-focus-on-fed-notes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4be1866baefbc176051134474a0324bcf5327f33-975x553.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

While his rival candidate, Minister Sergio Massa garnered 44% of the votes. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts XRP Price Will Reach $1.35 As These Metrics Heat Up The momentous victory positions Milei as the face of a new era in Argentina, marked by his stated commitment to solving inflationary problems in the country by abolishing the country’s Central Bank and using digital currencies like Bitcoin. In a public victory speech to his supporters in Buenos Aires, Milei declared that the transformative process of Argentina had just begun and the country was on its way to economic recovery. He promised to work with all the nations to help develop Argentina and make it a better country. “Today begins the reconstruction of Argentina. Today begins the end of Argentina’s decline. The model of decadence has come to an end. There is no way back,” Milei stated. He further added that “Argentina will return to its place in the world that it should never have lost. We are going to work shoulder-to-shoulder with all nations of the free world, to help build a better world.” Former President of the United States, Donald Trump commended Milei on securing victory in the Argentinian Presidential election. He expressed his pride in Milei’s incredible feat and stated his anticipation for Milei’s efforts in restoring Argentina. “Congratulations to Javier Milei on a great race for President of Argentina. The whole world was watching! I am very proud of you. You will turn your Country around and truly Make Argentina Great Again,” Trump stated.

42409463,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHXrd,1700477023,Bitcoin Options Open Interest Climbs to Record $15B on Crypto Exchange Deribit,"Notional open interest in BTC options listed on Deribit set a new peak of $15 billion last week.  Record activity points to an increased preference for options for hedging and leveraging gains.  Trading in bitcoin [BTC] options listed on the cryptocurrency exchange Deribit is more popular than ever.  On Friday, the notional bitcoin [BTC] open interest, or the U.S. dollar value locked in active bitcoin options contracts, rose to a record high of $15 billion. The figure has more than doubled since late September, topping the $14.36 billion peak registered during the bull-market days of October 2021. Back then, BTC traded above $60,000; today it's about $37,200.  At press time, notional options open interest had dropped back to $13.8 billion. In contract terms, open interest stood at over 376,000 BTC, nearly double the October 2021 tally, but well short of the record 433,540 BTC of March this year. On Deribit, one options contract represents one bitcoin.  ""We're excited to announce that we've just achieved a record-breaking $15 billion (ATH) in notional open interest in BTC options,"" Chief Commerical Officer Luuk Strijers said in an email. ""This development underscores the increasing preference for options as a strategic tool among traders, whether for positioning, hedging, or leveraging the recent surge in implied volatility.""  Deribit is the world's leading crypto options exchange, accounting for almost 87% of the global crypto options open interest of $25 billion. Options are financial contracts that represent the right to buy or sell an asset, in this case, bitcoin, at an agreed-upon price for a specific period of time. A call option gives the right to buy and a put the right to sell.  Recently, the BTC options market surpassed the BTC futures market in a sign of growing market sophistication.  Bitcoin has been on a tear since early October, rising to $38,000 from $25,000. There are several reasons for the rally, including optimism of an impending spot bitcoin ETF approval and macroeconomic developments. The positive price action has sent traders scrambling to take bullish exposure through call options.  ""Options flow remains very bullish with outright calls bought in large sizes on both BTC & ETH while call spreads are rolled higher on BTC,"" said over-the-counter institutional cryptocurrency trading network Paradigm in a Telegram message on Friday.  In 2019, Deribit partnered with Paradigm to launch a block trading tool. Block trades are privately negotiated large transactions in futures and options or a combination of the two.  According to Amberdata, large block trades of the December expiry call were executed last week at $40,000 and the January expiry call option at $50,000.

42409453,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHXKZ,1700472727,Bitcoin Fundamentals Have Never Looked Better: Bernstein,"Bitcoin [BTC] is expected to emerge as a global macropolitical asset with a more-than $3 trillion market cap, quadrupling by mid-2025, broker Bernstein said in a research report Monday.  Bernstein says the cryptocurrency’s fundamentals have never looked better, noting that 70% of the outstanding supply hasn’t been traded in the past year.  “This is an all-time high in bitcoin’s history – these churn rates are extraordinary for a financial asset, particularly one known for its exponential moves driven by a supply squeeze,” analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote.  Another potential positive catalyst is the bitcoin halving, likely in April or May next year. According to Bernstein, the halving is expected to reduce monthly selling pressure from miners to less than $500 million from around $1 billion at today’s prices of $37,000 per BTC.  More favorable accounting treatment based on new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) guidelines, which will allow companies to book mark-to-market gains on bitcoin inventory “will favorably impact corporate preference for holding bitcoin as a treasury asset, thus creating new demand sources from corporates,” the report said.  Another tailwind is the approval of a U.S.-listed spot bitcoin exchange-traded-fund (ETF), which will make it easier for companies and retail to gain access to the cryptocurrency. “U.S. bitcoin ETF is on track for an early 2024 approval, as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to engage on the applications from leading asset managers,” the authors wrote.  Bitcoin’s role as a “debasement hedge” may grow in prominence given the scenario of “debt monetization and/or a more gruesome slowdown in early 2024, with the lagging effect of rates over-correcting for inflation,” the report added.

An earlier version said the service was for Swiss clients.  Santander Private Banking International, part of Spanish financial services giant Banco Santander, is offering high-net-worth clients with Swiss accounts trading and investing in the major cryptocurrencies bitcoin [BTC] and ether [ETH], according to an internal announcement seen by CoinDesk.  Over the next several months, Santander will offer additional cryptocurrencies that meet the bank’s screening criteria, the announcement said.  Santander said the service is provided only upon client request through relationship managers, and the assets are held in a regulated custody model in which the bank stores the private cryptographic keys in a secure environment.  This is a bold move, given that most big banks prefer to be twiddling around with tokenization and tend to avoid exposure to open-access blockchains and the cryptocurrencies that run on them.  Banco Santander is more than 160 years old and has 166 million customers. The private bank caters to 210,000 wealthy clients, with assets and deposits accounting for about $315 billion.  “The Swiss regulation related to digital assets is one of the first and most advanced in the world, since it provides clarity and a comprehensive regulatory environment for our clients,” said John Whelan, head of crypto and digital assets at Santander, in an email. “As holding of crypto as an alternative asset class continues to expand, we expect that our clients prefer to rely on their existing financial institutions to be responsible for their assets.”",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/11/20/santander-private-bank-introduces-bitcoin-ethereum-trading-for-swiss-clients,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/75b7f5a2abe1a91a19ac045ccc59be128fa3f098-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

20440431,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=561462,1700467210,"XRP Price Correction Is Over, Targets Set By Top Crypto Analysts","The XRP price has risen by around 6% in the past three days, triggering renewed optimism among investors and analysts. The two analysts Dark Defender and Egrag see the current trend as a turning point. XRP Price Correction Over? Dark Defender has highlighted a key development in the 4-hour time frame, observing the end of a corrective structure and identifying that XRP has reached an oversold area. “We can expect a move to $0.6649 first,” Dark Defender stated, referencing the Fibonacci retracement levels and a 5 Wave Elliott structure that remains intact, suggesting upward potential. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: XRP Price Enters DCA Range, Suggests Buying Opportunity This is supported by the chart that shows XRP has managed to close above a critical level at $0.6131, which aligns with the Elliott Wave Theory’s rules for wave structures. The analyst further emphasized that the $0.87-$1.05 price target is still achievable in the near term if weekly closes maintain above the $0.6131 threshold. Egrag’s analysis focuses on the gaussian channel and a symmetrical triangle pattern (in the 5-day chart), which are indicative of consolidating markets leading to a potential breakout. According to Egrag, “XRP Gaussian Channel & Symmetrical Triangle Unveil (Strong Support and Resistance Patterns): Within the framework of the Gaussian Channel, the alignment of support and resistance price targets mirrors other charts, adding weight to their significance.” Related Reading: XRP’s Triple-Digit Forecast: Top Advocate Casts Doubts On Dream Valuation The provided chart by Egrag points to a “robust support” at $0.50, with additional support levels at $0.54-$0.55 (“support range”) and $0.60 (“support threshold”). The resistance levels are identified by Egrag at a macro resistance point and a symmetrical triangle trend line between $0.83 and $0.85. Egrag advises the XRP community to remain steadfast, saying, “XRP Army STAY STEADY, anticipate the forthcoming mega pump, yet exercise caution by strategically allocating portions of your holdings.” Combining these technical analyses, it’s clear that both analysts are pinpointing a convergence of technical indicators suggesting a bullish reversal for XRP. Dark Defender’s chart analysis, with its emphasis on Elliott Wave continuation, and Egrag’s identification of Gaussian Channel patterns, both point to a potential increase in the price, provided it remains above certain support levels. Price Analysis: 1-Day Chart The analysis of the 1-day chart of XRP using the Fibonacci retracement level shows that the price is facing strong resistance in the short term. At the current price of $0.6194, XRP is just below the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.627 and below the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.625. The confluence of these two indicators represents significant resistance in the short term. Remarkably, XRP has received important support at the 50-day EMA at $0.591, which could allow the bulls to regain the upper hand. For this to happen, however, resistance at $0.625 needs to be broken. The next price targets could then be the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.688 and the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $0.759, which abruptly halted the upward movement that began in early October and ushered in the current consolidation.

But betters on decentralized prediction platform Polymarket are putting their money where their mouth is when they take a guess.  Over the weekend, Altman, the Chief Executive of the multi-billion artificial intelligence startup behind ChatGPT, was forced out of his role because he ""was not consistently candid in his communications"" with the board.  While the memo was not specific about why Altman was forced to depart from the company, this was no reason for gamblers on Polymarket not to spin up prediction market contracts to bet on why he left – or what he plans on doing next.  Currently, the market with the most liquidity is one that asks betters to predict if Altman will be back as CEO by the end of the year. While ""Yes"" shares are trading for 10 cents – representing a 10% chance – this outcome flipped over the course of Sunday U.S. time when Bloomberg reported that former Twitch boss Emmet Shear had been appointed to the role.  Another contract asks if Altman would be criminally charged by Nov. 30, with Yes currently trading at 1 cent. A report from Axios, citing a leaked memo, says that Altman's firing ""was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices.""  Contracts are also asking betters if, for example, Altman will announce a new company by Nov. 24 (Yes is currently trading at 24 cents), if Altman will sue OpenAI, or if Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI's chief scientist, will still be at the company by Jan. 1. More than $250,000 in liquidity was spread across eight prediction contracts on Sunday.  Some reports say that Sutskever was instrumental in removing Altman from the company.

42409471,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcHYEm,1700463748,"Bitcoin Held in Exchange Wallets Rising at Pace of $1.16B a Month, Data Show","Bitcoin [BTC] stashed in wallets tied to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges is rising at the fastest pace since May, hinting at a potential bull pause in the market.  Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode's bitcoin exchange net position change metric, which measures the number of coins held by exchange wallets on a specific date compared to the same date four weeks ago, rose to 31,382.43 BTC ($1.16 billion) on Sunday, the highest since May 11, 2023. That has lifted the total balance held on exchanges to 2.35 million BTC.  An inflow into exchange wallets is widely taken to represent investors' intention to liquidate their holdings, a potential selling pressure, or deploy coins as a margin in futures and options markets. Meanwhile, an outflow represents accumulation.  The BTC exchange net position change has been consistently positive since Nov. 1. Historically, such periods have coincided with bull market breathers or price pullbacks.  That said, the latest inflow could also signify renewed investor confidence in centralized exchanges.  The safety of coins held in exchange wallets came into question late last year after Sam Bankman Fried's FTX exchange collapsed, which, at the time, was the third largest. That saw investors move coins off exchanges and into their direct custody.  Bitcoin changed hands at $37,170 at press time, according to CoinDesk Indices data, having put in a high of $31,517 late Sunday, supposedly on the back of BTC-supportive Javier Milei's victory in Argentina's Presidential elections.  The leading cryptocurrency by market value has gained 7.5% this month, extending October's 28% rise, CoinDesk data show.  We may earn a commission from partner links.
