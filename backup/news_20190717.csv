42430743,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTrh,1563404462,Coinbase Releases New Data Tools for 'First-Time' Crypto Investors,"Coinbase is rolling out new tools to help entry-level crypto users understand what seasoned traders are up to.  The exchange announced Wednesday the availability of a new suite of signaling tools. One such tool broadcasts the activity of Coinbase’s top traders.  ""The top holder activity signal is the percentage of Coinbase customers with large balances of an asset (top 10%) who have net increased (bought) or decreased (sold) their positions in that asset through trading over the last 24 hours,"" an official Coinbase blog post explained. ""This is updated approximately every 2 hours.""  Speaking to CoinDesk, a Coinbase spokesperson further detailed that top holder activity would be aggregated from all individual Coinbase accounts across the exchange – excluding those set up by institutions.  Beyond sharing metrics on Coinbase power users, the San Francisco-based company is rolling out other data tools to help retail users make more informed decisions.  Coinbase customers will also be able see the median number of days an asset is held by traders on the exchange before being sold or moved to another address. Another tool gauges the popularity of assets on Coinbase, as well as relative price correlations to other crypto assets.  All these ""exclusive"" data tools are available to any user for free starting today, according to Coinbase.  Speaking to the goals behind adding the new tools, a Coinbase spokesperson told CoinDesk:  ""For individual investors, especially those new to crypto, we hope these new signals will encourage more informed management of a diversified crypto portfolio. We want trading signals to help first-time investors build the right portfolio to suit their investment goals.""  Selling point  Having done some early analysis with these tools, Coinbase senior engineer Will Drevo says Coinbase's top crypto accounts have a tendency to buy rather than sell their portfolio positions.  In another blog post, Drevo wrote:  ""Historically, when top holders are either unusually bullish or bearish this has been indicative of changing market conditions, but not always.""  In sum, leveraging a strictly signal-based investment strategy, Drevo writes, is not always beneficial to traders and should not be taken directly as investment strategy or advice. Rather, users are encouraged ""to create and manage their own crypto strategy"" based on a user's own needs, financial means and risk tolerance.  ""If in doubt, consider consulting a financial professional,"" Drevo writes.  Founded in 2012, Coinbase snagged an $8 billion valuation late last year after raising $300 million in venture capital. As reported last week, the exchange may soon set up its own insurance company with the help of brokerage Aon.

42430738,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTjh,1563399628,Sexual Misconduct Allegations Emerge Against Bitcoin Coder Peter Todd,"The Takeaway:  Former Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd filed a defamation suit in April demanding the deletion of a tweet that accused him of sexual misconduct. In response, three people submitted statements to the court this week accusing Todd of such misconduct.  One alleged victim, ""Jane Doe,"" stated she stopped contributing to bitcoin projects in order to avoid Todd.  The incident is shaping up to be a first-of-its-kind in the bitcoin community, a public incident that could force conference providers and projects to be more active in responding to allegations of misconduct.  Several conferences have received complaints about Todd, citing such allegations of sexual misconduct.      Publicly filed court documents have now revealed specific allegations of sexual misconduct involving former Bitcoin Core developer Peter Todd.  Todd sued transgender cryptographer Isis Agora Lovecruft for defamation in a California court in April, demanding they delete a tweet calling Todd a ""rapist."" This week, Lovecruft moved to dismiss the complaint, and both Lovecruft and zcash co-founder Zooko Wilcox filed declarations in court describing Todd’s alleged behavior.  In their declaration, Lovecruft accused Todd of sexual harassment, including unwelcome and violent sexual statements during consulting work on a bitcoin project. According to Lovecruft’s filed declaration, Todd told Lovecruft in a San Francisco cafe, “I’m going to shove my cock in you so hard and beat you until you beg for more.”  Lovecruft also stated in their court filing that Todd grabbed their arm when his advances were rejected. Lovecruft’s declaration also included private Twitter messages with a third party describing Todd’s unwanted sexual advances, as well as private Signal messages from a woman who claimed Todd raped her, identified as Jane Doe.  Wilcox’s court declaration (a copy of which he also published in a Medium blog post on Tuesday) detailed his experiences with Todd. (It should be noted that Todd has been particularly outspoken in his criticism of the zcash project, which Wilcox spearheads.) Dating back to 2012, Todd is one of the top 25 contributors to the Bitcoin Core code repository and remains an influential figure in the space.  In the court statement, Wilcox said one female friend asked him for help avoiding Todd’s unwelcome advances, and another female friend described being “pressured into sex” by Todd. According to their declaration, Lovecruft was referring to the second victim (called “Jane Doe” in the court filings) in the Feb. 20 tweet at issue in this case.  Wilcox said in his court statement that Jane Doe told him “Mr. Todd had pressured her into sex while she was in a mentally compromised state due to a medical condition.”  In an interview with CoinDesk, Jane Doe said the incident drove her to stop participating in bitcoin projects.  “There are other areas of computer science, I just don’t want to see him ever again,” she said. “I just want him to leave me alone. And there’s no way to know that for sure. I’m past worrying about the broader crypto community. I just want to live my life. … The only thing I could think about in the days afterward is worrying that he’d contact me or retaliate.”  CoinDesk has reached out to Todd’s legal representation and will update the article if we hear back. Todd’s complaint denies that he has raped or sexually assaulted Lovecruft “or anybody else.”  Repercussions  CoinDesk has spoken with the two alleged victims mentioned by both Wilcox and Lovecruft in their court filings. During an interview with CoinDesk, Jane Doe described Todd’s alleged coercive sexual activity in explicit detail which was consistent with the court filings.  Doe said there were no third-party witnesses to the alleged assault.  The incidents described by both women took place within the bitcoin community, at professional events or in private meetings arranged to discuss topics related to computer science. Both women described their experiences as traumatic.  Doe expressed concerns about Todd’s “power” to influence the broader crypto community. Todd has long been one of the most active contributors to the Bitcoin Core project and was also involved in the launch of zcash in 2016.  In interviews with CoinDesk, the alleged victims said the incidents impacted their ability to engage in public forums, both online and in-person, related to cryptocurrency development.  The alleged victim referred to in Wilcox’s declaration as “my friend” told CoinDesk she was told by a prospective business partner that people were reluctant to work with her because they were now “unsure about her character.” (She eventually got a job working with this business partner.)  Not alone  Lovecruft’s declaration describes a theme that is common in allegations of workplace-related harassment or assault: Speaking up can lead to retaliation against the accuser.  A report from the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission cited a 2003 study finding that 75 percent of workers who spoke out against mistreatment “faced some form of retaliation.”  CoinDesk interviewed several other individuals who alleged they were subjected to sexual assault or harassment, not involving Todd, in various contexts related to their work in the blockchain industry. They all told CoinDesk they did not speak out publicly because they feared ostracism from the community.  Some who tried to speak up within the group ended up having to leave the projects they were contributing to. Several of the sources, including one of the alleged victims mentioned in the Todd court documents, told CoinDesk their private testimonies of misconduct were either dismissed or led to retaliation.  Given the open-source ethos of the bitcoin community, alleged victims said, requests for help led nowhere because no one was systematically responsible for such misconduct.  Todd has also faced backlash, but perhaps in a milder form. An anonymous complaint was submitted to the MIT Bitcoin Expo in March for allowing Todd to speak, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. (Todd went on to speak at the MIT event.)  The source also said Todd did not speak at the Monero Konferenco in June because of allegations of sexual misconduct.

The firm announcedhttps://www.bitcoinsuisse.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Press-Release-EN.pdf on Tuesday that it has applied for a banking license with Swiss Financial Markets Supervision Authority (FINMA), as well as a security dealer’s license, mandated by the Stock Exchange and Securities Trading Act (SESTA). In the past, financial authorities at the Swiss Federal Council said blockchain and distributed ledger technology will be governed by existing regulatory schemes.  However, a Suisse company representative said:  ""We believe that in the long-term, more regulation will follow, as soon as the legislation catches up with the technological developments of the space. We believe that within this new regulatory environment, companies without the necessary licenses will have a limited ability to serve clients with the full spectrum of high quality, innovative crypto-financial products and solutions.""  In the announcement, the company said these preemptive licenses will expand the number of regulated services and products it can offer as ""more and more crypto assets and services fall under securities and banking law."" At the moment, the company representative denied comment on specific assets, but offered, ""A securities dealer license would enable us to trade crypto tokens that have been classified as securities by the financial regulator. This would include our own stable coin, the Swiss Crypto Franc.""  In May, SIX, the Swiss national stock exchange group announced it was developing the CHF Stable Coin pegged to the Swiss franc – to automate processes and potentially tokenize assets on the SIX Digital Exchange.  As part of Swiss banking guidelines, the company announced it has deposited CHF45 million – an equivalent amount in USD – as collateral for a default bank guarantee. It plans to increase this reserve by CHF10 million, past the mandatory limit. These holdings will help secure clients’ fiat and pooled crypto deposits.  This is not to say Swiss regulations are overly burdensome. ""The regulatory industry in Switzerland is very crypto-friendly. The Federal Council as well as the FINMA are pursuing a very constructive approach that fosters innovation in the long-term,"" a company representative said  Indeed, these applications come after the firm already extended its list of tradable assets to 125 cryptocurrencies, enabling more than 6,000 trading pairs, as well as the firm's entrance into the collateralized lending and credit markets for institutional clients last year. Its expanded footprint also includes the firm’s subsidiary Swiss Crypto Vault AG which provides custodial crypto storage for businesses. As of June, the vault oversees $1 billion in assets.  Founded in 2013 as a brokerage, the firm has expanded to include prime brokerage, trading, storage, and lending services.  According to the announcement, Suisse’s net income this past year reached CHF25 million, from revenues of CHF44 million. It has also added 90 experts to its staff and expanded offices to Zug, Copenhagen and Vaduz.

42430746,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTph,1563390053,Grin Cryptocurrency Executes First Hard Fork,"Privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Grin has just executed its first backward-incompatible upgrade, also called a hard fork.  Today's planned upgrade introduces key changes to the nearly $60-million network that will optimize for maximum miner decentralization and usability. Grin launched in January 2019.  “It was planned since way before Grin launched,” Grin developer John Tromp told CoinDesk. “We would do four hard forks in the first two years, at regular six-month intervals, to introduce new features.”  Tromp said that today’s upgrade did not result in a network split. Rather, the old Grin network simply halted “in its tracks,” effectively forcing users to update their software. The upgrade was completedhttps://grin.blockscan.com/block/262080 at 9:45 UTC.  Tromp explained:  “In a classical fork, the chain can split into two mutually incompatible continuations. … In Grin, there is no way to continue growing the ‘old’ chain since the old code refuses to accept any blocks past the [hard fork] height.”  One of the most integral changes introduced on the Grin network today is a tweak to one of two mining algorithms. As previously reported, Grin supports a mining algorithm that is friendly toward both general-purpose computing devices called GPUs and specialized hardware called ASICs.  However, Wednesday's fork looks to dissuade specialized machinery from being built for the GPU-friendly algorithm.  Quentin Le Sceller, a Grin core developer and software engineer at blockchain startup BlockCypher, explained:  “It's not really forking ASICs from the network but ensuring that no one is building ASICs for the [GPU-friendly mining algorithm.]”  In order to ensure that ASICs don’t hold a monopoly on the Grin mining industry – estimated to generate over $100 million annually by today’s coin prices – Wednesday’s update ensures the playing field remains ASIC-resistant for the short-term future of the Grin protocol.  In another six months, additional tweaks to the newly implemented mining algorithm will be activated by Grin developers. Tromp, who is in charge of these mining algorithm edits, also affirmed that for the second Grin fork, developers will take the first step toward adding payment channels to the network.  “[Payment channels are] a way for two parties to perform many off-chain transactions between them,” Tromp said. “[It requires] one on-chain transaction at the outset and one settlement at the end.”  Payment channels were first popularized on the bitcoin network as a way to scale transaction volume by decreasing confirmation wait times.  Beam, another cryptocurrency built on the privacy-enhancing blockchain protocol mimblewimble, is undertaking a hard fork in August. Like Grin's upgrade, Beam will also be adding payment-channel functionality and a mining algorithm update meant to keep ASICs in check.

42430739,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMxTlh,1563383271,Lawmakers Amp Up Pressure on Facebook to Halt Libra Cryptocurrency Development,"U.S. lawmakers repeatedly pressed Facebook's top blockchain executive to halt development of the Libra cryptocurrency during a contentious hearing on the project Wednesday.  They didn’t get far.  David Marcus, the CEO of Facebook's subsidiary Calibra, reiterated his promise that Libra would not launch until regulators' concerns were fully addressed. But he stopped short of committing to freezing technical work on the project, much to the chagrin of House Financial Services Committee members.  The committee's chairwoman, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), had previously called for a moratorium, and it was one of the first things she brought up in the hearing, asking the Facebook executive:  ""Will you stop dancing around this question and commit here in this committee ... to a moratorium until Congress enacts an appropriate legal framework to ensure that Libra and Calibra do what you claim it will do?""  Marcus responded with roughly the same talking point he's been using for weeks.  ""I agree with you that this needs to be analyzed and understood before it can be launched ... and this is my commitment to you. We will take the time to get this right,"" he said.  Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) raised the issue during her turn to question Marcus. He started to give a similar answer to what he said earlier, but before he could finish, she cut him off.  “I take that as a no,” she said.  Maloney then asked Marcus if he would at least promise to do a small pilot test of Libra, involving no more than 1 million users and overseen by the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), before fully launching the currency. Again, he demurred, saying only that he would commit to working with regulators.  Not that a pilot would be her preferred outcome. ""I don't think you should launch a new currency at all,"" Maloney said.  De-platforming concerns  Like the previous day's Senate Banking Committee hearing, Wednesday's panel was wide-ranging, with lawmakers grilling Marcus on everything from money laundering to financial stability to whether Libra should be regulated as an exchange-traded fund (ETF) or a bank.  Rep. Brad Sherman (D.-Calif.), perhaps crypto's loudest Congressional critic, suggested that Libra was somehow more dangerous to America than 9/11.  Comparatively sober colleagues wondered if the project would become ""systemically important,"" Beltway-speak for ""too big to fail.""  The Republicans on the panel were less hostile but nevertheless asked pointed questions.  Rep. Sean Duffy (R.-Wis.), for example, complimented Marcus for Facebook's innovation but asked if Libra would ban controversial speakers like Milo Yiannopoulos or Louis Farrakhan from using the platform, as Facebook has done in its flagship social network.  ""Personally, I believe we shouldn’t be in the business of telling people what they can do with their money,"" Marcus responded, adding a caveat that such policies would be up to the governing council of the Libra Association consortium.  AOC weighs in  Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the young lawmaker known for her social media savvy and socialist economic positions, brought an interesting bit of monetary history into the discussion.  She suggested that the Libra currency would be a digital version of scrip, a type of private money that corporations once used to pay employees. (Coal miners and loggers, for instance, were paid in scrip they could use to buy goods at the company store.)  Marcus, a former president of PayPal, said he was not familiar with the term.  Ocasio-Cortez also questioned the governance of this aspiring global currency. ""Were the members of the association democratically elected? Who picked them?"" she asked Marcus.  He replied that the membership is open, subject to certain requirements.  ""So we’re discussing a currency governed by private corporations,"" Ocasio-Cortez went on. ""Do you believe the currency is a public good? Do you believe Libra should be a public good?""  Marcus answered that ""it’s not up to me to decide.""  Inside the basket  Marcus also provided more detail than before about the makeup of the basket of fiat currencies that would back Libra.  He told the lawmakers (several of whom were concerned about Libra's threat to U.S. financial dominance) that the reserve will ""mainly"" be backed by the U.S. dollar. The Facebook executive later specified that it would be 50 percent dollars, with euros, British pounds and the Japanese yen also included in the collateral.  Regarding Libra's collateral, Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) seized on another historical comparison: the wildcat banks of the early 19th century, which issued their own notes purportedly redeemable for gold and often failed to deliver on their promises to pay noteholders.  ""How is it fundamentally different from wildcat banking?"" she asked Marcus.  ""A very important difference is the one-to-one reserve,"" he said.  Porter then asked what's to stop the Libra Association from swapping out the reserve from 50 percent greenbacks to, say, 100 Venezuelan bolivares.  Marcus answered that the Libra Association would be regulated. By whom, Porter asked. Marcus said it would be an oversight group of the Group of Seven (G7) nations that he'd mentioned Libra was working with several times before.  The 's' word  After Marcus' testimony, expert witnesses, including former Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) chairman Gary Gensler, shared their perspectives with the lawmakers. All were skeptical of the project.  All five raised their hands when Rep. Nydia Margarita Velázquez Serrano (D-N.Y.) asked who agreed Facebook should hold off on launching Libra until all the concerns were resolved. As expected, Gensler argued that Libra is a security and should be regulated as such.  The sole crypto native on the panel, CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors, articulated the difference between bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, and Libra.  While the former is decentralized, the latter is ""highly centralized,"" she noted; while bitcoin itself is an asset (albeit a digital one), Libra is backed by other assets; and whereas anyone can download the bitcoin software and run a node, the Libra Association is, for the foreseeable future, an exclusive club.  ""Libra is not a cryptocurrency ... I want to distinguish and draw a very clear line,"" Demirors said.  She also likened Libra to a mutual fund with two classes of shares, referring to the fact that in addition to the publicly available Libra currency, there will be a Libra investment token, reserved for accredited buyers, that captures all the interest income from the reserve's government securities.  Finally, in a historic moment for bitcoin culture, Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) uttered the word ""shitcoin,"" almost certainly the first time a lawmaker has done so in the halls of Congress.  Davidson asked what differentiated bitcoin from low-quality knockoffs that carry the epithet. Demirors explained that as a truly decentralized currency with distributed infrastructure, bitcoin can't be easily and quickly changed by a single party.  It wasn't the first time the word appeared in the Congressional record, however; crypto-skeptic Nouriel Roubini had used it when testifying in October.

In an analysts call Tuesday, first reported by CNBC, Dimon appeared to suggest that it was too early to speculate on how the effort, advertised as a global currency for the unbanked, would impact his company or its outlook. JP Morgan is the leading bank in terms of U.S. retail deposits, according to its most recent annual report.  “We’re going to be talking about Libra three years from now. I wouldn’t spend too much time on it,"" Dimon said, when asked about Facebook's entrance into the financial sector through cryptocurrency.  The chief executive added:  “To put it in perspective, we’ve been talking about blockchain for seven years and very little has happened.""  In previous interviews, Dimon has noted that cryptocurrency companies might compete with legacy banks. Still, he believes regulations will be a factor in how such technologies may be rolled out to the public, potentially delaying their timelines.  “Governments are going to insist that people who hold money or move money all live according to rules where they have the right controls in place; no-one wants to aid and abet terrorism or criminal activities,” Dimon said.  Facebook planned to debut the stable-backed cryptocurrency in 2020, but has since come out to say it will not offer the digital currency until all regulatory concerns have been addressed.  “We don’t mind competition,” Dimon said. “The request is always going to be the same: We want a level playing field.  JPMorgan proposed its own cryptocurrency, JPM Coin, in February to be used internally to speed up transactions. “The technology is very good, but it takes time in terms of licensing and approval. It must be explained,” lead developer Umar Farooq said prior to a trial period commencement.  For his part, David Marcus, lead developer of Facebook’s blockchain, has said, Libra is “not designed as a substitute for bank accounts,” in a Senate Banking Committee hearing on the cryptocurrency yesterday.

42382360,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rM07,1563380113,The Case $7.5K Could Become Bitcoin's New Price Support,"Amidst a decline in the price of bitcoin, the world's most valuable cryptocurrency could find support at $7,500 – that is if it follows past patterns on the charts.  Bitcoin has faced selling pressure over the last few days, despite an impending golden crossover on the three-day chart – a bullish crossover of the 50- and 200-candle moving averages, as discussed last week. As of writing, the 50-candle moving average (MA) is on an upward trajectory and looks set to cross above the 200-candle MA in the next few days.  It is worth noting, however, that a similar golden crossover on the three-day chart was observed in early February 2016, when a bitcoin bull market was then in its nascent stages.  More importantly, BTC was heavily offered in the run-up to the confirmation of the golden crossover. Prices dropped to the 200-candle MA support days before the bull cross happened and that level was never put to test again, as seen in the chart below.  3-day chart (2015-16)  As seen above, BTC took a beating in six weeks leading up to the golden crossover confirmed on Feb. 3, 2016. Prices topped out at $467 seen in mid-December 2015 and almost tested the 200-candle MA support line of $348 in three days to January 19.  Over the next couple of months, BTC largely traded in the range of $360 to $450 before breaking higher. Essentially, the 200-candle MA served as a base ahead of the golden crossover and the level was never tested again throughout the rally from $450 to $20,000.  Also, it is worth noting that BTC rallied more than 140 percent from the August lows near $200, before topping out above $460 in mid-December.  The price action seen over the last few months looks eerily similar to the one discussed above.  3-day chart (2019)  Placed in recent context, BTC rose to a 17-month high of $13,880 last month. At that level, the cryptocurrency was up nearly 250 percent from lows near $4,000 observed at the end of March.  As of now, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at $9,600, representing a 30 percent drop from recent highs. Essentially, the cryptocurrency is losing ground in the run-up to the golden crossover the way it did before the bull cross of February 2016.  If history is a guide, then the ongoing pullback could be extended further to the 200-candle MA, currently flatlined $7,448. Also, prices may bounce back strongly from that level and resume the bull market.  Will history repeat itself?  History is known to repeat itself in financial markets and the bitcoin market is no exception.  The top cryptocurrency now appear to have bottomed out in December 2018 – i.e. a year and a half ahead of the mining reward halving due in May 2020 (reminding the crypto community of the seller exhaustion ahead of the reward halving and that took place in August 2016).  Over the last five months, a number of technical indicators have produced patterns similar to those seen before the onset of the bull market in late 2015.  For instance, the 50- and 100-week moving averages produced a bearish crossover in February - two months before BTC broke into a bull market and two months after the cryptocurrency bottomed out near $3,100. A similar bear cross was observed months before BTC's bullish breakout of October 2015.  All-in-all, there is a strong case to believe that BTC would drop to the 200-candle MA, currently at $7,448, before the confirmation of the golden crossover on the 3-day chart and then rise back sharply.

Announced this morning, Horizon Games raised $3.75 million in seed funding in a round led by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian's Initialized Capital. Other investors included Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Inovia Capital and more.  Originally closed in the summer of 2018, the funds have been used to scale-up production on a new ethereum-powered game called ""Skyweaver"" and a gaming platform called Arcadeum. ""Skyweaver"" is billed as a ""Trading Card Game from Another Dimension.""  ""I wanted to introduce a product on blockchain technology,"" Horizon Games CEO Peter Kieltyka told CoinDesk. ""We wanted to deliver something my friends could use.""  A serial entrepreneur with two prior exits already, Kieltyka's vision is very much to go mainstream and offer a blockchain-based competitor to ""Hearthstone,"" which currently has over 100 million registered players.  ""We realized this was a huge market, it's a huge idea,"" Kieltyka said. ""'CryptoKitties' had come out, and we could see the movement.""  Game and platform  Horizon is both a game studio and a platform company enabling the distribution of blockchain games.  The company has been working on ""Skyweaver"" – a game in which players engage in one-on-one contests with other players using collectible cards – since late last year. As it did so, Horizon began needing to solve infrastructure problems around running the game, and that contributed to developing the Arcadeum platform that it hopes other game makers will find useful.  ""It solves a number of token contracts and scalability issues,"" Kieltyka told CoinDesk. ""You can't make a blockchain game stack unless you make a game and you know it fits the mold.""  This is a well-worn path in the gaming industry. For example, a major source of revenue for Epic Games is the licensing of its Unreal Engine.  ""Skyweaver"" manages its collectible cards using the ERC-1155 token standard. The free-to-play game will give users a randomly collected set of cards to use as they learn to play. Users can also buy individual cards directly from Horizon for one DAI each.  Players will also be able to earn cards by playing more and winning. Kieltyka says additional mechanics the company plans to add later will both enhance the value of certain cards and keep the overall supply under control.  Unlike most games in the space, Horizon has opted not to sell booster packs (multiple cards of mixed rarity). Instead, it will sell cards individually at a fixed price.  Competitive environment  Horizon's view is that the big prize isn't to win over crypto but to win over gamers.  Nevertheless, it faces projects like ""Gods Unchained"" on one side – a collectible card game with a similar value proposition – and projects like ""The Abyss"" – which aims to help blockchain game developers smooth their path to market – on the other.  ""Skyweaver"" launched in beta in the last month and has 330 players, many of whom have been playing and returning to the game at length. Horizon aims to open the game to the public at the end of the year.  Built with WebGL, the game will be cross-platform at launch, playable on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. It's playable on the web or via any of several native apps the company has already built. There will be 350 cards available at launch.  Kieltyka argues the game design of ""Skyweaver"" goes further than simply allowing people to own cards. Since their price is fixed and the cards can also be earned through play, it functions more like a loyalty system.  Said Kieltyka:  ""These crazy large networks, they can reward their pro users. People on the internet are going to start demanding these things more and more.""

Also called HUSD, Stable Universal Limited created the new token, which “will be regulated and audited to be 1:1 to the actual value of U.S. dollar,” according to a press release.  “In today’s cryptocurrency markets, traders always need access to a safe, trustworthy stablecoin that is fully redeemable and limits risk exposure,” Frank Zhang, CEO of Stable Universal, said in a statement. “The HUSD Token is reliable and designed to be efficient and simple – we believe it’s the best fiat on-ramp and will be a game-changer in the space.”  The token will be listed on the Huobi exchange but will also be available on other exchanges and wallets. According to a company statement, ""a top U.S. auditing firm"" will perform monthly attestations to make sure the project's USD reserves match the supply of HUSD.  “Stable Universal will work with third parties for smart contract audit and on-chain transaction monitoring,” the company added.  The new stablecoin can be bought and redeemed at a forthcoming website from Stable Universal, stcoins.com, Huobi said in a press release. HUSD will be integrated into the Huobi Global exchange as well as Huobi's OTC service. Stable Universal is backed by Huobi Capital.  “Providing better options to the cryptocurrency community has always been one of our biggest priorities here at Huobi,” said Huobi Global CEO Livio Weng.  Notably, the dollars backing HUSD will be held in reserve by Paxos Trust Company, which is a qualified custodian regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS).  “Paxos maintains a unique position in the crypto-asset space because of our regulatory stack and deep commitment to protecting customer assets,"" Paxos co-founder Richmond Teo said in a statement. ""This is a new model that allows other innovators to create safe, trusted and fully-backed solutions that support wider crypto-market adoption for cash and assets using our unique regulated status.""  The Huobi Group is a $1 trillion exchange and owns part of Stable Universal. Paxos is a New York-based startup that aims to digitize all assets, “from money to commodities to securities,” the company wrote. Paxos also issues its own dollar-backed stablecoin, PAX.

Announced Wednesday, the company has hired three new senior managers that will turn tZERO's leadership structure into one more resembling a corporation than a startup.  Firstly, Brooke Navarro, now head of issuance at tZERO, spend almost a decade at Barclays and became one of the few female managing directors there in 2018, focusing on equity markets in tech, media and telecom. According to tZERO's CEO Saum Noursalehi, the firm had been looking for ""the right person"" for six months before finally finding Navarro.  Navarro told CoinDesk:  ""Ecosystems for raising and trading capital have not evolved significantly in decades. I know first hand that issuers and investors want better. By joining tZERO, I have the opportunity to increase the speed and reach of the adoption of new technologies that will modernize the industry.""  Meanwhile, tZERO's new head of investor relations, Michael Mougias, was attracted from Canadian movie theater giant IMAX, where he held the same title for six years. Mougias also has experience in the capital markets, having worked at a private capital markets firm Ipreo, which was acquired by IHS Markit last year.  For a third new hiring, tZERO has also lured over Alexandra Sotiropoulos, formerly PR manager at marketing company Intermarket – a firm that has been managing tZERO's PR for some time. Sotiropoulos will become tZERO's head of communication.  New tokens and partnerships  Having started at tZERO on Monday, Navarro will be responsible for finding companies that want to raise capital via issuing tokens on the platform, as well as strategic partners to boost the adoption of tZERO's technology, the company said.  The first such partnership was announced this May with Securitize, with tZERO to list some of the tokens issued on Securitize's protocol.  As for the new tokens, two previously anticipated deals, with automaker Elio Motors and UAE real estate giant Emaar, are still pending, Noursalehi told CoinDesk, as negotiations over the details are still ongoing.

42382361,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rM1N,1563361219,Bitcoin Price Looks South After Second-Largest 24-Hour Drop of 2019,"View  Bitcoin closed below $9,614 on Tuesday, confirming a bearish reversal on the daily chart. The invalidation of bullish higher-lows pattern is backed by bearish developments on the short-term charts.  Prices risk falling to $9,097 (May 30 high) in the next 24 hours. A close below that would expose the 100-day moving average line, currently located near $8,100.  A key indicator is reporting oversold conditions as per the 4-hour chart, so a minor bounce before any drop below $9,097 cannot be ruled out.  The long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as BTC is holding above the 200-day moving average line.      Bitcoin logged one of the biggest daily price losses of the year on Tuesday, confirming a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change in the process.  The world's biggest cryptocurrency by market value closed (UTC) at $9,412.81 on Bitstamp, down 13.25 percent from the daily opening price of $10,848. That's the second-largest single-day drop of 2019, the first being the 13.67 percent price slide observed on June 27.  With the drop and the resulting UTC close below the July 2 low of $9,614, BTC has invalidated the most basic of all bullish patterns – the series of higher lows on the daily chart.  Media outlets have associated the recent drop with the growing calls for regulation of Facebook's Libra project and cryptocurrencies in general.  For instance, Facebook's plan came under attack at a U.S. hearing on Tuesday, with senators calling the company delusional and untrustworthy and questioning the social media giant on how it was planning to prevent money laundering. And, a week ago, President Donald Trump called for banking regulation on bitcoin and Facebook's Libra.  Now many in the investor community are beginning to worry that Facebook's Libra project will end up fast-tracking regulations for the crypto market.  The shift in sentiment will likely have a bearing on bitcoin's price. After all, the crypto market leader rallied from $9,000 to $13,880 in the eight days following Facebook's unveiling of Libra's white paper on June 18.  With the odds now stacked in favor of bitcoin's bears, the cryptocurrency could suffer a deeper drop in the short-run.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $9,400 on Bitstamp.  Daily chart  Bitcoin's invalidation of bullish higher-lows pattern, as represented by Tuesday's UTC close below $9,615, is backed by a below-50 (bearish) reading on the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) and the downward sloping 5- and 10-day moving averages (MAs).  Further, prices are trading below the key support of the 50-day MA for the first time since early February.  The Chaikin money flow, which takes into account both prices and trading volumes, is barely holding in positive territory, a sign that buying pressure has weakened significantly over the last three weeks.  So, the stage looks set for a drop to $9,097 (May 30 high). A violation there would expose the 100-day MA, currently at $8,122.  A weekly close above $12,000 is needed to invalidate the bearish setup, as discussed yesterday.  4-hour chart  The RSI on the 4-hour chart is reporting oversold conditions. As a result, BTC may chart a bearish lower high around $10,000 before falling to $9,097 or below.  While short-duration charts are calling a deeper drop, the long-term outlook will remain bullish as long as prices are held above the 200-day MA, currently lined up at $5,983.  It's worth noting that prominent analysts believe the ongoing price drop is nothing but a correction in a bull market.  ""We'll retrace inside a temporary downtrend"", @pierre_crypt0 tweeted yesterday.  Alex Kruger  , a renowned technical and fundamental analyst, also feels the price is drop is a healthy correction.

42382355,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLtp,1563359412,France's Financial Watchdog Proposes 'Voluntary' Regulatory Framework for Crypto Firms,"The Financial Markets Authority (AMF), France’s top financial organization, plans to release an experimental regulatory framework for crypto firms later this month, according to a Reuters report.  The rules will include capital requirements, tax mandates, and consumer protection protocols – which “crypto-related firms will voluntarily abide by” in exchange for regulatory approval, reports Reuters.  Anne Marechal, executive director for legal affairs at the AMF, called the experimental arrangement a “precursor” for international crypto-specific legislation, rather than the mismatched application of financial regulations written prior to the advent of the asset class.  This is not the first time France has unveiled a “tit for tat” regulatory scheme. In April, the AMF released a requirement for banks to open accounts for crypto firms that “opt in” to being regulated. Part of the PACTE law, crypto exchanges and custodians were also extended the “option” to attain an operating visa.  At the time, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire suggested the European Union follow ""the French experience"" by using the PACTE guidance to set up a ""single regulatory framework"" for digital assets in the EU single market.  These relatively unrestrictive legal measures were taken to promote the growth of small and medium-size businesses. While some governments, organizations, or industry leaders call explicitly for self-regulation or no regulation, many believe clearer rules regarding the sale, distribution, trading of cryptocurrencies would stimulate, rather than hamper, the industry.  Frederic Montagnon, the co-founder of LGO, a crypto exchange looking to expand into France, told Reuters, “When you are an entrepreneur, the worst that can happen to you is to set up your business where there is no regulation, to see an adverse regulatory framework later imposed that jeopardizes your whole business.”  Marechal said “several” crypto exchanges, custodians, and hedge funds are in dialogue regarding the regulatory framework with the AMF, which is also set to approve “three or four” ICOs.  Specifics will arise when the watchdog publishes the regulatory guidance.

42382350,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLmH,1563355235,Tether Stablecoin to Launch on Algorand Blockchain,"The popular and sometimes controversial stablecoin tether (USDT) is to launch on a fifth blockchain.  Announced by the (mostly) U.S. dollar-backed token's issuer on its website, the news means traders will have a USD stablecoin option on omni, ethereum, tron, EOS and, soon, algorand.  “Extending Tether into the Algorand ecosystem is a fantastic opportunity for us to further contribute to blockchain interoperability and collaboration. ... We are very excited about the potential this enables for other projects in the decentralised ecosystem and we eagerly await working closely with many of them in the future,” said Tether CTO Paolo Ardoino.  Tether is widely used by traders to move money in and out of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin without needing to exchange back into dollars with each trade. Crypto exchanges also use the token to transfer funds between each other to avoid having to move lots of bucks through not always cooperative banks.  Despite its widespread use in the crypto markets, the stablecoin has had its issues – including accidentally minting $5 billion USDT during a chain swap process last weekend.  Long a concern to users and regulators, Tether has never released a full accounting audit to prove its coin is backed by USD, as it claimed for years. Its lawyer recently acknowledged that, in fact, USDT was only about 74 percent backed by fiat equivalents as of April 30.  Tether's relationship with its sister firm, crypto exchange Bitfinex, has also come under the spotlight, with claims the token has been used to prop up the price of bitcoin.  New York's Attorney General's office has further alleged that Bitfinex lost $850 million and subsequently used funds from Tether to secretly cover the shortfall, and said that Bitfinex had operated in the state without a license.

42382353,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9rLq3,1563351009,Ex-CFTC Advisor: Facebook's Libra Could Be Both Security and Commodity,"""Is it a security? Is it a commodity pool? Is it a payment token? Is it a utility token? It's a particularly important question ... not just domestically, but also internationally.""  So said Jeff Bandman, a former fintech advisor at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), speaking to CoinDesk about Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency in a live broadcast on Tuesday.  Stressing, ""one of the most important question about Libra is what it is,"" Bandman suggested there could be a long way to go before a decision is made by regulators over Facebook's Libra, and how it's classified will not be Facebook's call in the end.  He said:  ""It's not as if Facebook can just select the category itself identifies with ... and regulators will just agree to it. They [the regulators] will look behind the scenes, not just the form [of Libra], but the substance and function, and they will decide what it is.""  While an advisor at the CFTC, Bandman founded LabCFTC, the agency’s in-house unit dedicated to emerging technologies including cryptocurrency.  His comments come just a day after former CFTC chairman Gary Gensler argued in prepared remarks to the U.S. House of Representatives that in his view, Facebook's Libra appears to be an investment vehicle, is thus a security, and should be regulated as such.  However, Bandman argued that, given Facebook's ambitious is to reach its customers at a global scale, definitions of the token will likely vary.  ""If Libra is a payment system, the payment system regulators are typically the central banks,"" Bandman said. ""And then you have to look at all the countries Libra is potentially being used or deployed. They may all have slightly different definitions. Maybe in the U.S., Libra is considered as a security, but maybe not in Switzerland.""  The types of regulators that are most concerned with the Libra project are those whose mandate is to look after financial stability, Bandman indicated.  ""For the last a couple of years, different groups have looked at crypto assets and generally concluded they are not a threat to financial stability because they are small,"" he said.  ""But now all of a sudden you have a platform with 2.5 billion users. Anything that it does will necessarily be large. That doesn't automatically mean it becomes a threat to financial stability. But because this is on such a scale that if this thing gets off the ground and launches, there could be financial stability implications on day one.""  Elsewhere in his remarks, Bandman also raised concerns over Facebook's banning of crypto-related ads on its social media platform while developing its own token behind the scenes.  Facebook unveiled a policy in January 2018 to ban ads related to initial coin offerings and cryptocurrencies. It eased the ban by requiring a pre-approval process for certain types of ads in June 2018 and further softened the policy in May this year (just weeks before its unveiling of Libra).  ""Something I personally find troubling is, Facebook, for a period of over a year, banned crypto ads while working on their own cryptocurrency,"" he said, concluding:  ""Instead of investigating on Libra, maybe people should investigate on that. That sounds to me like a ... uncompetitive behavior.""  Bandman joined other speakers talking with CoinDesk in a live broadcast to unpack Facebook's hearing at the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday where the firm addressed lawmakers' concerns over its ambitious Libra project.

According to a report by Gazeta.ru, Waves CEO Alexander Ivanov “sold his stake” in the data management and smart city oriented project to Mark Garber of the financial consultancy GHP Group.  The Waves platform has developed blockchain solutions through partnering with some of Russia’s largest private and state-owned enterprises, as well as global firms, for institutional, industrial, and military use.  Vostok, in particular, aligned with the Russian state-owned conglomerate Rostec in 2018 to securely manage data for the firm’s 700 industrial entities. Additionally, the startup was instrumental in roadmapping the “digital economy” as part of the “Strategic Development Objectives of the Russian Federation up to 2024,” announced by President Vladimir Putin.  Ivanov told Gazeta:  “I would like to focus on the international development of the Waves Platform. The tasks of building a decentralized Internet of the new generation based on the blockchain (the so-called Web3), which we implement in Waves, require my one hundred percent concentration.”  Though details of the deal have not been disclosed, Garber plans to integrate Vostok’s digitalization solutions in GHP’s mining, production, and logistics projects.  Gazeta also reports that Garber holds a stake in the container transporting company Fesco and serves on the board of another trade logistics company, called TransContainer.  Vostok was formed in 2018. Its""Gorod N"" project saw a partnership with Nizhny Novgorod region administrators to develop a civic voting and public budgeting solution, which reportedly enables citizens to vote on where tax dollars are spent.  Garber intends to keep the startup's development team aboard, but will elect a new supervisory board.
