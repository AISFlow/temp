32238592,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634296,1723244436,Ethereum Vs. Solana: Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Reveals The ‘Clear Winner’,"A crypto analyst has reignited the debate between Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), evaluating which cryptocurrency was more superior. Considering recent market trends and performances of both altcoins, the analyst has finally identified a clear winner in the competition. Solana Wins Battle Against Ethereum In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, legendary crypto trader and analyst, Peter Brandt drew a comparison between Solana and Ethereum, spotlighting their fundamental characteristics, strengths and weaknesses. Based on his analysis, Brandt suggests that it was inevitable that one will be recognized as the clear winner or superior blockchain and cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Ethereum Vs. Solana: Legendary Trader Peter Brandt Reveals The ‘Clear Winner’ Sharing a price chart of Solana/Ethereum, the analyst offered a critical view of Ethereum, highlighting several vulnerabilities that are plaguing the blockchain. Despite being the second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Brandt has described ETH as a difficult network to use, likely attributing this to its slow transaction speeds. He stated that Ethereum was expensive, cumbersome, and flawed. Moreover, the analyst has cast doubts on Ethereum’s claim to decentralization, suggesting that the blockchain was not as decentralized as it presents itself to be. On the other hand, Brandt praised Solana for its numerous strengths and noteworthy characteristics. The analyst points out that Solana’s ability to offer high speed transactions at a fraction of the cost of Ethereum was impressive. Brandt also disclosed that Solana’s network was easier to use, making it more accessible to developers and users. Additionally, the analyst highlights that Solana maintains a strong technical base, possibly referring to the blockchain’s unique Proof Of History (PoH) consensus mechanism. From the analyst’s perspective, Solana’s strong fundamentals and superior functionalities gives it a significant edge over Ethereum. He concluded his analysis with a bold prediction, stating that Solana could gain 100% in value relative to Ethereum in the months ahead. This underscores the analyst’s belief that Solana could potentially outperform Ethereum in the market. While Brandt’s comparison of Ethereum and Solana may suggest a bias against Ethereum, the analyst has clarified that he actually does not dislike ETH. ETH Forms Death Cross While SOL Surges To $160 A crypto analyst identified as ‘KickEx’ revealed in an X post that Ethereum and Bitcoin are forming a death cross on their respective price charts. The analyst notes that ETH’s recent market crash has led to the formation of a worrisome technical pattern. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin Price Could Reach New ATH If It Holds This Level KickEx has disclosed that if the death cross pattern plays out, Ethereum may experience a massive price decline in the liquidity range of around $2,000 per coin. At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency is trading at $2,682, reflecting a 10.84% increase, according to CoinMarketCap. While Ethereum’s price faces a potentially bleak future outlook, Solana has been performing relatively well in the market. The cryptocurrency recently hit the $160 price level, marking a rise of over 10%. Although the cryptocurrency has since retreated to $157, Solana continues to show strong bullish signals amidst market downtrends.

The recent 30% drop in Bitcoin appears to be a clearing capitulation, preparing for the next bull movement. Bitcoin has already rallied 26% since bottoming out, smashing short-term downtrend and price resistance. In recent articles , I offered an analysis that the sideways correction that has been playing out since March was nearing its end. The recent 30% drop in BTC-USD appears to have been a clearing capitulation that shook out weak hands, preparing the way for the next bull movement. The action off that low is consistent with the beginnings of such a move. The leading cryptocurrency has already rallied 26% since bottoming out in the $50,000 area, with the short-term downtrend and price resistance quickly and assertively smashed. TheBullBear.com, TradingView While moves of -29% followed by +26% may seem insane to the uninitiated, in Bitcoin terms this is par for the course. The entire period since March is, in fact, a minor episode that barely registers on longer-term charts. Let's have a look at the daily: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Here we can see that the action from the March high has been a garden-variety bull flag pattern, with a series of overlapping subwaves. If you look at the April-August 2023 period, you see many of the same technical features that preceded the big move to new all-time highs. Daily RSI goes down into its green support zone as the 20, 50, and 200-day exponential moving averages compressed together with the price. And then the price took off. You see the same setup today. You also see that the recent drop retested the breakout from the green channel from above. That means the price is about to start an advance with a steeper angle of ascent. Now on to the all-important weekly chart: TheBullBear.com, TradingView Again, if you check out the condition of weekly RSI before the last rally started in September as well as the configuration of price and the 20 and 50-week EMAs, you see the same setup. Once that short-term red downtrend gets taken out, the rally won't stop until the weekly RSI gets way back up into its red resistance zone. The Bitcoin Greed/Fear Index is at a fearful extreme right now. Once that bearishness starts to unwind, Bitcoin will move at +10% clips on a daily basis. alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/ Look out above! To reiterate, my target for this next rally is a minimum of 100k with 300k a distinct possibility.

32234089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634304,1723233623,Dogecoin Price Could Soar 900%: Analyst Predicts What Needs To Happen,"Since reaching its yearly high of $0.2288 on March 28, the Dogecoin price has plummeted by over 54%. From its all-time high in May 2021, the DOGE price has declined by more than 85%. Despite this downturn, crypto analyst Cryptorphic (@Cryptorphic1) suggests that a bullish reversal may be on the horizon. Cryptorphic has conducted an in-depth analysis of the weekly DOGE/USDT chart, positing that Dogecoin could experience a substantial 900% surge in price. This optimistic forecast is underpinned by a combination of seven factors, ranging from technical indicators to broader market trends. What Needs To Happen For Dogecoin To Skyrocket By 900%? The chart shared by the analyst shows Dogecoin’s performance since February 2021, which is capped in a tightly bound channel. This channel was defined by consistent lower highs and higher lows forming a predictable pattern for over 1,127 days, until a notable change occurred. Based on this, Cryptorphic reveals seven arguments for being ultra bullish on DOGE. #1 Breakout Above Accumulation Channel In the last week of February 2024, DOGE experienced a breakout characterized by a massive candle that propelled it beyond the upper limits of this long-term channel. Following this breakout, Dogecoin entered a phase of retesting the upper boundary of the previous channel, a crucial phase for confirming the strength and potential longevity of the breakout. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Looking Stronger – ‘Expect Massive Gains’, Analyst Predicts The breakout is quite significant for occurring after over three years of price consolidation within a defined range. Such a long period of accumulation often sets the stage for massive price move once breached. A successful retest typically confirms the breakout’s validity and could signal a continuation of the upward trend. #2 Strong Weekly Doji Candle Another key aspect of what needs to happen is “printing a strong weekly Doji, signaling significant buying pressure from the bulls.” Such a candlestick on the weekly chart would be characterized by a small body with a long lower shadow, suggesting a victory for the bulls in a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. #3 The “Musk-Effect” The mention of Dogecoin by Elon Musk, who may be promoting DOGE as a means of payment on X after the presidential election, could increase speculative sentiment. Musk’s tweets have had an extremely strong influence on the DOGE price in the past, but things have gone very quiet in recent months. “Elon Musk is likely to shill it after the presidential election this year,” the crypto analyst speculates. #4 Moving Averages From a technical standpoint, Dogecoin’s current position above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) suggests a strong bullish sentiment in the long-term perspective. Conversely, its struggle to maintain above the 100-day EMA indicates immediate challenges. Thus, a decisive close above the 100-day EMA could be another major sign for a DOGE bull run. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Following Crash Below $0.1 #5 Relative Strength Index The Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently below 45, supports the theory that there is “plenty of room to grow” without pushing the asset into the overbought territory. This is critical as it suggests that despite recent gains, the asset is not yet at risk of a major sell-off due to overvaluation, according to this metric. #6 Market Trends The analysis also highlights the current trend where memecoins are outperforming more fundamentally solid projects, indicating a market preference that could favor DOGE in a bullish cycle. This needs to continue. “MEME coins have been outperforming solid projects this season, and I believe DOGE will lead the charge in this bull run,” the analyst states. #7 Weekly Close Above $0.11 Overall, the analyst claims that “Multiple indicators are suggesting a bullish move is on the horizon.” He plans to maintain a position in Dogecoin, with an intention to buy on dips—a strategy that leverages potential volatility for accumulation at lower prices. The identified trigger point for a bullish acceleration is a weekly close above $0.11 in the grey liquidity area. A close above this threshold could catalyze the anticipated rally. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.10432.

David Shuttleworth, research partner at Anagram, noted that USDC on the Ethereum network recorded the bulk of the expansion with $1.36 billion, while USDC on Solana saw $356 million inflows.  The growth happened as customers appeared to move funds to exchanges following the sell-off. Binance, the largest crypto exchange, saw over $1.5 billion in USDT deposits and $820 million in USDC deposits in four days following the Monday crash, DefiLlama data shows.

32232358,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634466,1723229325,XRP or MPEPE: Which Crypto Will Bring More Life-Changing Profits,"The cryptocurrency landscape is abuzz with excitement as investors weigh their options between Ripple (XRP) and the rapidly emerging Mpeppe (MPEPE) token. With both cryptos showing potential for substantial gains, the question on everyone’s mind is: which one will deliver life-changing profits? Ripple (XRP): A Legal Victory Sparks a Rally Ripple (XRP) has been a cornerstone of the crypto market for years, largely due to its utility in facilitating cross-border payments and its strong institutional support. The recent legal victory against the SEC has only strengthened its position. After four years of legal battles, Ripple was finally handed a verdict requiring the company to pay a fine of $125 million, a far cry from the $2 billion initially sought by the SEC. Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, celebrated this outcome as a major win for both Ripple and the broader crypto industry. Following the verdict, XRP’s price surged by over 20%, marking it as one of the top performers in the market. This rally has reignited interest among investors, especially with Ripple’s ongoing efforts to expand its partnerships and strengthen its market position. However, the question remains: can Ripple (XRP) continue this momentum and deliver the kind of life-changing profits that early Bitcoin and Ethereum investors enjoyed? Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender for 1000x Gains While XRP’s resurgence is noteworthy, many seasoned investors are turning their attention to a new player on the block—Mpeppe (MPEPE). This token is quickly gaining traction, especially among those looking for the next big thing in the crypto space. With predictions of a 1000x surge in value, Mpeppe is positioning itself as a formidable contender for life-changing profits. Mpeppe (MPEPE) is not just another meme coin. It is built around a robust ecosystem that focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi) gaming and gambling—a sector that is poised for significant growth. The token’s smart contract, 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, ensures secure and transparent transactions, further boosting investor confidence. Unlike traditional meme coins, which rely heavily on hype, Mpeppe offers real utility in a rapidly expanding market. Its focus on DeFi gaming and the lucrative online gambling industry gives it a strong foundation for long-term growth. This is why even Ripple (XRP) whales are beginning to diversify their portfolios by investing in Mpeppe. Why Mpeppe Could Outperform XRP While XRP has the advantage of being a well-established player with strong institutional backing, Mpeppe offers something that Ripple (XRP) currently doesn’t—a focus on a high-growth, emerging sector. The DeFi gaming and gambling markets are expected to see exponential growth in the coming years, and Mpeppe is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Moreover, the potential for a 1000x return on investment is something that XRP, despite its recent gains, is unlikely to match in the near term. Mpeppe’s early-stage entry point and innovative use case make it an attractive option for those looking to multiply their investments significantly. Conclusion: The Verdict When it comes to choosing between Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), the decision ultimately depends on your investment strategy. If you’re looking for a more stable, long-term investment with a proven track record, Ripple (XRP) is a solid choice, especially following its recent legal victory. Mpeppe offers an exciting opportunity to be part of something new and potentially groundbreaking. In the end, both Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe have their merits, but for those who are willing to ride the wave of innovation, Mpeppe could very well be the crypto that brings about the next generation of crypto millionaires.

32232250,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634464,1723229072,PEPU vs MPEPE: Shiba Inu Whale Adds MPEPE Presale For Predicted 240X Price Surge,"In the world of cryptocurrency, where fortunes are made and lost at the blink of an eye, savvy investors are always on the lookout for the next big opportunity. Recently, a Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale made headlines by shifting focus from the well-established Pepe Unchained (PEPU) to the promising new memecoin Mpeppe (MPEPE), predicting a staggering 240x price surge. This move has caught the attention of the crypto community, raising questions about the potential of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and its prospects in comparison to Pepe Unchained (PEPU) Pepe Unchained (PEPU): A Groundbreaking Meme Coin Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is making waves in the meme coin world with its pioneering approach, setting itself apart from other meme coins through its advanced technological framework. Unlike typical meme coins that rely on existing blockchain networks, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has innovated by creating its own Layer-2 network. This network is not only faster—boasting speeds that eclipse Ethereum by a significant margin—but also more cost-effective, making transactions smoother and cheaper for users. The appeal of Pepe Unchained (PEPU) extends beyond just speed and low fees; the token’s ecosystem is designed to reward long-term holders. The robust staking mechanism is a key feature that has drawn in a considerable number of investors. Offering an annual return of 254%, PEPU’s staking rewards are highly competitive, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking to maximize their crypto holdings. What truly sets Pepe Unchained (PEPU) apart is its unique blend of meme culture with cutting-edge blockchain technology. This combination has not only captured the attention of the crypto community but also positioned PEPU as a potential leader in the meme coin space. With its focus on addressing common blockchain issues such as high transaction costs and latency, PEPU provides a more efficient and enjoyable experience for its users. As the project continues to gain momentum, it is becoming increasingly clear that Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is more than just another meme coin—it is a well-thought-out project with the potential to redefine the standards of meme coins in the crypto world. The project’s early success has sparked discussions about its future, with many investors seeing it as a promising alternative to older meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The Rising Star with a 240X Potential While Pepe Unchained (PEPU) has been making waves, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a formidable competitor, particularly among Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales looking for the next big investment. Mpeppe is not just another meme coin; it’s a gambling-focused memecoin that promises to bring significant profits to early investors. The smart contract address for Mpeppe (MPEPE) is 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B, and it’s already gaining traction in the crypto community. What makes Mpeppe (MPEPE) particularly appealing is its focus on the gambling sector, a rapidly growing industry with enormous profit potential. Mpeppe aims to combine the excitement of meme coins with the lucrative world of online gambling, offering a unique value proposition that has already attracted significant attention. Analysts predict that Mpeppe could see a 240x price surge, making it one of the most promising investments in the current market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Whale’s Strategic Move The decision by a Shiba Inu (SHIB) whale to invest in Mpeppe (MPEPE) highlights the growing interest in this new memecoin. Shiba Inu, known for its massive community and significant market presence, has been a staple in the portfolios of many crypto investors. However, the whale’s move to Mpeppe indicates a strategic shift towards opportunities with higher growth potential. This investment is seen as a calculated risk, leveraging the whale’s deep understanding of the market to capitalize on Mpeppe’s anticipated price surge. The whale’s involvement has further boosted confidence in Mpeppe (MPEPE), with many other investors following suit, eager to get in on the action before the presale ends. The Future: PEPU vs MPEPE As the battle between Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) heats up, investors are closely watching to see which project will deliver the highest returns. PEPU’s established presence and technological advantages make it a strong contender, but Mpeppe’s focus on the gambling industry and potential for massive price growth are hard to ignore. Both projects offer unique value propositions, and the decision to invest may ultimately come down to an investor’s risk tolerance and long-term goals. With the crypto market known for its volatility, both Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe present exciting opportunities, but only time will tell which will emerge as the ultimate winner. For those looking to diversify their portfolio and maximize profits, adding Mpeppe alongside Pepe Unchained (PEPU) could be a wise move. As the presale for Mpeppe nears its end, the window of opportunity is closing fast, and early investors are poised to reap significant rewards. In conclusion, the crypto market is abuzz with the potential of these two memecoins, and the involvement of a Shiba Inu whale only adds to the excitement. Whether Pepe Unchained (PEPU) or Mpeppe will come out on top remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the next few months will be critical in determining the future of these groundbreaking projects.

32232088,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634460,1723228705,Ethereum ETF vs Mpeppe: Market Experts Dive Into Which Is the Better Investment,"Investors face a plethora of choices, each promising unique benefits and potential returns. Among the latest discussions is the choice between investing in Ethereum (ETH) ETFs and the newly launched Mpeppe (MPEPE). Market experts are diving deep into which of these options offers better long-term value. Let’s explore why Ethereum (ETH) ETFs and Mpeppe (MPEPE) are generating buzz and what might be the more prudent investment choice. Ethereum ETF: A Stable Gateway to Crypto Investment Ethereum (ETH) ETFs offer a regulated, straightforward way to gain exposure to Ethereum without holding the cryptocurrency directly. Here’s why Ethereum ETFs might appeal to traditional investors: – Regulatory Compliance: Ethereum (ETH) ETFs operate under regulatory frameworks that provide a level of security and transparency. This makes them an attractive option for investors wary of the unregulated nature of many cryptocurrencies. – Diversification: ETFs offer a diversified investment in Ethereum (ETH), which can help mitigate risks associated with holding a single asset. By investing in an ETF, investors gain exposure to Ethereum as part of a broader portfolio. – Ease of Access: For those unfamiliar with the complexities of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, Ethereum (ETH) ETFs simplify the investment process. They allow investors to trade Ethereum in a familiar stock market environment. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Contender in the Crypto Space Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a new cryptocurrency that’s been attracting significant attention due to its innovative approach and potential for high returns. Here’s why Mpeppe (MPEPE) is catching the eye of investors: Mpeppe (MPEPE) isn’t just another cryptocurrency; it’s designed to build a vibrant community that thrives on creativity and strategic planning. This approach aims to foster a global community that celebrates soccer and embraces wealth creation through blockchain technology. Mpeppe (MPEPE) integrates decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to offer features such as yield farming, liquidity mining, and decentralized governance. These elements provide added utility and could potentially offer significant returns to its community. With its unique positioning at the intersection of meme culture and blockchain innovation, Mpeppe (MPEPE) harnesses the power of viral marketing. This could drive rapid adoption and growth, mirroring the success of other meme-based cryptocurrencies. Comparing Stability with Innovation When comparing Ethereum (ETH) ETFs with Mpeppe (MPEPE), the key considerations often boil down to stability versus innovation: Ethereum (ETH) ETFs offer stability and security, especially for traditional investors seeking regulated investment avenues. They provide a steady way to invest in Ethereum’s value without the direct risks associated with holding the cryptocurrency itself. Mpeppe (MPEPE), on the other hand, embodies innovation and community-driven growth. While it carries higher risk due to its nascent stage and reliance on DeFi protocols, its potential for explosive growth and unique positioning offer appealing opportunities. Conclusion: Which Investment Holds the Edge? Ethereum ETFs and Mpeppe (MPEPE) offer distinct investment options for different investor profiles. Ethereum ETFs provide a stable, regulated investment in the Ethereum ecosystem, while Mpeppe (MPEPE) uses innovative DeFi protocols and a community-driven vision for high growth and engagement in the evolving crypto space.

32232032,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634457,1723228536,Will Ethereum (ETH) Hit A New ATH In August? Whilst New ICO Built On ETH Skyrockets.,"As Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the cryptocurrency landscape, investors and enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating whether the blockchain giant will achieve a new all-time high (ATH) this August. Simultaneously, a new ICO built on the Ethereum (ETH) network, Mpeppe (MPEPE), is making waves with its rapid ascent and innovative features. Here’s a deep dive into the current Ethereum (ETH) landscape and how Mpeppe (MPEPE) is poised to capitalize on the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem. Ethereum (ETH)’s Path to a New ATH Ethereum (ETH) has consistently been at the forefront of blockchain innovation since its inception. Known for its smart contract capabilities and decentralized applications (dApps), Ethereum (ETH) has paved the way for numerous advancements in the crypto space. As we approach August, speculation is rife about whether ETH will reach a new ATH. Several factors are contributing to the bullish sentiment surrounding Ethereum (ETH). The Ethereum (ETH) network’s transition to Ethereum (ETH) 2.0 is a major driver, aiming to address scalability issues and improve transaction efficiency through its Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This upgrade is anticipated to significantly enhance network performance, potentially boosting ETH’s value. Additionally, Ethereum (ETH)’s role as the foundational layer for a multitude of DeFi (decentralized finance) projects and NFTs (non-fungible tokens) reinforces its market position. The growing adoption of DeFi services and the increasing popularity of NFTs are expected to drive further demand for ETH, possibly propelling it to new heights. How Mpeppe (MPEPE) Enhances Ethereum (ETH)’s Ecosystem Mpeppe (MPEPE) is more than just a meme coin; it represents a strategic integration of Ethereum (ETH)’s capabilities with new, innovative concepts.

This not only adds value to the Mpeppe (MPEPE) community but also highlights the versatility and transformative potential of Ethereum (ETH)’s blockchain. The convergence of Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s innovative features with Ethereum (ETH)’s established network demonstrates the growing potential of DeFi and blockchain technology. Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s success could serve as a catalyst for more projects leveraging Ethereum (ETH)’s infrastructure, further solidifying Ethereum (ETH)’s position as a leading blockchain platform. Why Ethereum (ETH) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) Are Key to August’s Crypto Landscape The interplay between Ethereum (ETH)’s potential for reaching a new ATH and Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid growth underscores a pivotal moment in the cryptocurrency market. As Ethereum (ETH) strives to achieve new highs, Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s performance offers valuable insights into the current state and future direction of Ethereum (ETH)-based projects. Investors should keep a close eye on Ethereum (ETH)’s market movements and the continued success of Mpeppe (MPEPE). The success of Mpeppe (MPEPE) could be a bellwether for other projects within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem, indicating a broader trend of innovation and growth. Conclusion As August approaches, Ethereum (ETH) and the new ICO Mpeppe (MPEPE) are gaining attention due to their potential to hit a new ATH. Ethereum (ETH)’s technological advancements and growing adoption are bolstered by its potential, while Mpeppe (MPEPE)’s rapid rise demonstrates the innovative possibilities within the Ethereum (ETH) ecosystem.

32231919,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634295,1723228235,"XRP Has Surpassed Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Solana Combined In This Metric","The long-standing legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has finally made significant progress in court, and the case may be nearing its end, with a surge for XRP. As expected, this development revitalized interest in XRP, Ripple’s native cryptocurrency, which in turn led to a noticeable surge in XRP’s activity across the crypto industry. On-chain data reveals a surge in the number of transactions and trading volumes for XRP on major cryptocurrency exchanges. One of the most noteworthy instances of this trend can be seen on the South Korean exchange, Upbit, where XRP trading volume has surged dramatically. This surge has been so pronounced that XRP’s trading volume on Upbit has eclipsed that of major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The price of XRP experienced a rapid surge in the immediate aftermath of a pivotal court ruling by Judge Analisa Torres, a decision that Ripple executives and the community interpreted as a positive outcome for the payments technology company. As reported by Bitcoinist, the federal judge ordered Ripple to pay $125 million in civil penalties to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is significantly lower than the $2 billion initially sought by the regulator. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin Price Could Reach New ATH If It Holds This Level In reaction, XRP surged from $0.50 to $0.6368 in less than two hours, according to data from Coinmarketcap. This sharp increase in value was accompanied by an extraordinary spike in trading activity, particularly on the South Korean-based exchange Upbit. During this period, Upbit’s trading volume reached an astounding 746 million XRP, valued at over 610 billion KRW within a 24-hour time frame. At the height of this trading frenzy, XRP accounted for more than 30% of the total volume on the exchange. This huge trading volume was enough to account for 14% of the total transactions worldwide after the court ruling. Chad Steingraber, a fervent XRP enthusiast, shared this statistic on social media platform X. Bithumb, another prominent cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea, also witnessed a dramatic increase in XRP trading volume. The altcoin’s trading volume surged past other major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, accounting for 22% of the total trading volume on the exchange. What’s Next For XRP? The recent ruling means XRP is now free from the burden of the lawsuit that has hampered its price growth for the past four years. However, despite this positive development, the case could continue to cast a shadow over XRP if the SEC decides to appeal the ruling. An appeal could extend the legal proceedings, thereby prolonging the uncertainty that has followed its price performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Vs.

The recent price surge means the cryptocurrency has broken out of a descending triangle pattern again.

42390630,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4cQB,1723227464,"IRS Shares New Crypto Tax Form, Invites Industry Input","The new U.S. tax form for crypto investors' brokerage accounts is out, and it's been narrowed in significant ways from an earlier version.  Crypto's 1099 form will ""bring more ease and clarity"" for those paying U.S. crypto taxes, according to IRS officials.  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has released an updated draft version of the tax form crypto brokers and investors will use to report proceeds from certain transactions, the 1099-DA.  Beginning in 2026, crypto investors who use brokers – which, for now, largely means centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken – will receive the 1099-DA from those brokers to report certain crypto sale and exchange transactions to the IRS as taxable events.  The updated version of the 1099-DA released Friday is more streamlined than the first draft of the tax reporting form floated by the IRS in April. The spaces for investors to write in their wallet addresses and transaction IDs – which raised significant privacy concerns when the form was first unveiled – have been removed. There is also no longer a requirement to include the time of the relevant transactions, just the date.  The original form also included a box asking the filer to identify which type of broker they are, including “kiosk operator,” “digital asset payment processor,” “hosted wallet provider,” “unhosted wallet provider,” and “other” as the options. That box is no longer included on the updated version of the form.  The updated form is ""massively improved/less burdensome and requires considerably less data reporting,” wrote crypto lawyer Drew Hinkes, a Miami-based partner at law firm K&L Gates, on X.  Thisdraft of the 1099-DA comes two months after the IRS released its finalized regulations for crypto broker reporting requirements. The IRS has said that it plans to provide rules for decentralized and non-custodial brokers in a different set of regulations later this year.  ""The new Form 1099-DA will help taxpayers comply with the complex world of digital assets,” said IRS Office of Digital Asset Initiative Directors Raj Mukherjee and Seth Wilks in an emailed statement. ""It complements the 6045 broker regulations released recently and provides a vehicle in which taxpayers can report their in-scope digital asset gains and losses, starting in tax year 2025. This is an important step forward in the digital asset information reporting and will bring more ease and clarity to that process.""

42390642,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4dKb,1723224330,Crypto Needs to Radically Rethink Token Distribution,"A major blocker for mainstream blockchain adoption remains the prevailing sense that the space is still too focused on speculation. To build a sustainable ecosystem and onboard more users, protocols must radically rethink how tokens are distributed. The focus must shift from inflated valuations and speculative price action to long-term utility and transparency.  This year, the cryptocurrency market has witnessed a resurgence in token launches, many of which have adopted a ""low float, high fully-diluted value (FDV)"" strategy. The plan is simple: launch at a high price, lead with a multi-billion dollar valuation and create hype around the project’s potential. This playbook has been broadly criticized but has proven irresistible for many projects chasing attention.The problem? It is entirely artificial.  The “low float, high FDV” model involves releasing a small percentage of the total token supply (the float) to the market while assigning a high price to each token. This creates a deceptively inflated FDV for the project, and many token holders fail to account for the remaining token supply that is still to reach circulation.  While this approach can generate significant initial interest, numerous projects that have adopted this model see short-lived benefits that disintegrate in the long-term. This is not a sustainable approach and takes attention away from what should be the real focus of all crypto projects — long-term utility and protocol adoption. Bitcoin took years to build up a user base — today, projects can do so with one big launch.  Crypto must make bolder bets to refocus the industry on distribution and utility, while eschewing price speculation.  There is a better way to manage token launches — one that prioritizes long-term utility and organic growth over speculative gains. Protocols are beginning to experiment with alternative models. FRIEND, a blockchain-based social platform, for example, launched with 100% float, distributing all tokens to the community from day one. After taking a radically different approach at Lava Network, I am convinced the industry must adopt a new standard for how blockchain projects should handle token distribution and valuation.  A Market-Derived Approach  By sharing experiences and insights from the lessons learned at Lava, an access layer for blockchains, I hope we can inspire a shift towards more responsible and sustainable token launch practices. Together, a stronger, more resilient blockchain ecosystem that benefits all participants can be built.  This alternative token launch strategy is centered around a market-derived FDV through decentralized exchange (DEX) trading designed to reduce speculation and organically foster a community of believers and long-term network participants. By ensuring a higher initial float and a capped supply, this approach makes the focus more about a token's intrinsic utility and the project's real-world potential - rather than speculative pricing.  This strategy offers several key benefits:  Reduced Speculation: With a higher initial float, the market can more accurately price the token based on its utility and demand, rather than speculative hype.  Organic Growth: A market-derived FDV fosters a community focused on the project's long-term success and utility.  Transparency and Trust: By avoiding the pitfalls of inflated valuations, this approach builds greater trust with the community and stakeholders, ensuring a more stable and predictable road ahead.  While some might argue that a market-derived FDV approach could result in slower initial growth or the risk of undervaluation, the long-term benefits of a stable, sustainable protocol far outweigh these short-term concerns.  Recent commentary in the blockchain space has also highlighted the need for change. For example, a CoinDesk article by Azeem Khan rightly argued for a shift away from inflated valuations to attract retail investors and revitalize the market for VC tokens. While this perspective recognizes the shortcomings of high FDVs, it primarily focuses on engaging retail investors by keeping valuations lower and creating market hype.  However, it doesn't go far enough. A long-term sustainable approach should not merely be about lowering valuations but about creating genuine value and utility that resonates with both retail investors and the broader community. The emphasis should be on transparency, realistic valuations, and fostering organic growth, not just immediate market excitement.  Building a Sustainable Blockchain Ecosystem  The blockchain industry is still in its nascent stages, and how token launches are managed today will shape the ecosystem's future. A market-derived FDV approach is a call to action for other projects to prioritize transparency, long-term utility, and community trust over short-term gains.  The blockchain industry stands at a crossroads. Continuing down the path of low float, high FDV launches will only lead to more market instability and disillusioned investors. By embracing a market-derived FDV approach, projects can build stronger, more resilient ecosystems that benefit everyone involved. It's time for the industry to focus on building real products - and less on the next shiny new token.

42390628,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4cFv,1723223797,What the NYT and Washington Post Op-Eds Get Wrong About Crypto,"It’s silly season in crypto policy, and we’re starting to see hyperbolic hot takes denouncing crypto in two of the major newspapers of record in the U.S.  First, New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, a long-time contrarian on the impact of technology on the economy, released a column on the role of crypto in the election where he suggested crypto was merely “technobabble and libertarian derp, . . . which has actually been reinforced by the passage of time.” He also says he does not believe that crypto solves any problems “that can’t be handled more easily and cheaply in other ways… I’ve been in many meetings over the years in which skeptics have asked crypto advocates that question and have never heard a clear answer.”  This opinion was surpassed in its misunderstanding by the Washington Post editorial board, which decided to write a poorly-evidenced love letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler. According to the Washington Post’s editorial, “Cryptocurrency is a volatile asset with no intrinsic value. It is used almost exclusively to speculate or to engage in shady businesses, such as selling drugs or collecting ransom, for which the anonymous nature of crypto accounts come in handy.”  And today, unsurprisingly, another opinion piece in The New York Times warns us all, “don’t be fooled.”  Given the high stakes of this election for crypto and America, it is more important than ever that misinformation about crypto be vigorously corrected. As Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously said “You are entitled to your opinion. But you are not entitled to your own facts.” Here are some key facts:  First, and most critically, only a small fraction of crypto is used for illicit activity, far less than we see in traditional finance, which according to the United Nations could be up to 5% of global GDP. Per analytics firm Chainalysis, money laundering accounts for less than 0.5% of all crypto transaction flows. This is also decreasing steadily over time. Even as crypto usage rose in 2023, the amount of money laundering in crypto fell from $31.5 billion in 2022 to $22.2 billion in 2023. No significant amount of illicit activity is acceptable, but to single out crypto as the villain is both inaccurate and tired.  Additionally, there are many important uses of crypto. For payments, crypto has innovated the stablecoin, a product fixed to the dollar with a total market capitalization of over $160 billion. Crypto is being used for election prediction markets like Polymarket, which even New York Times reporters monitor for insights. It is also being used to find better systems of real-time trading via decentralized finance, and billions of dollars of remittances just between the U.S. and Mexico.  Claims about Chair Gensler being some ordinary good-faith regulator focused on passing regulations on crypto are similarly inaccurate. In reality, Chair Gensler has aggressively fought efforts to pass legislation on crypto, reversing his stance in 2021 that he needed legislative authority to regulate crypto. In doing so, Chair Gensler has engaged in political warfare against Democrats on Capitol Hill, the crypto industry, and even his fellow Biden Administration regulators. By falling for SEC spin, the Washington Post editorial board has fallen for a confidence game by a politician in regulatory clothing.  Even the SEC now agrees that neither BTC nor ETH are securities, and judges appointed by Democrats have also disagreed with the SEC Chair’s claim that the law is clear. Every other major developed country and trading block, from Japan and the United Kingdom to the European Union, has responded to the novel questions posed by crypto by providing new regulation and legislation. In the U.S., however, the SEC has decided to do the governmental equivalent of jamming its fingers in its ears and screaming at companies that they are lawbreakers. This is activity that is not befitting any regulator, and should be the stuff of editorial board scorn — not accolades. The reality is that crypto is here to stay, and the question on the table is simply whether the United States waves goodbye as the next wave of innovation flows offshore.  The crypto industry has been in positive, open dialogue about reasonable legislation, and has engaged in good faith with policymakers. More than a year and a half has transpired since the crypto winter of 2022. Claims that crypto will disappear within six months have been made so frequently and so baselessly that they are beginning to resemble a little boy crying wolf.  It is long past time that the U.S. government do what all its peer nations have done and find workable bipartisan legislation and regulations for crypto. The failure to do so has harmed American competitiveness, the crypto industry and ordinary consumers. Worse, the campaign that has been waged by the SEC Chair largely in the press has given credence to the arguments of Donald Trump that all politics is base and hypocritical, thereby damaging Democrat arguments that they stand for fair process and the rule of law.  But to get to the point of passing legislation, it is important that not just crypto advocates like us but crypto skeptics actually have a basic understanding of what crypto actually is at present. Hopefully, flagging their myriad errors will make the Washington Post editorial board and Prof. Krugman put down their biases and actually look at the reality of crypto. Because without a doubt, crypto is here to stay.

Even though there are some negative signs as we speak, Santana believes that LINK’s price will go up a lot during the next bull market, possibly hitting an all-time high. Related Reading: Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Gives Bottom Signal: What Happened Last 2 Times Santana’s prognosis is hinged on LINK’s key acquisition period, which preceded the 2021 bull market. He calls 2023 a “recovery year,” with numerous cryptocurrencies tallying decent price gains but not a bull market. The analyst predicts a “huge” bull run by 2025 that could push LINK above $135. At the time of writing, LINK was trading at $10.60, up 6.1% in the last 24 hours, but sustained a 15.4% drop in the weekly frame, data from Coingecko shows. ✴️ ChainLink Pre-2025 Bull-Market Accumulation Zone & Strategy Hello my dear friend, Notice the huge difference between the bullish wave in 2021 vs the bullish wave in 2023! This is why I dubbed 2023 the “recovery year.” Last year many Altcoins produced a nice wave, a recovery… pic.twitter.com/DTF977g5yT — Alan Santana (@lamatrades1111) August 8, 2024 Current Market Conditions Despite the fact that Santana is hopeful about the future, the present state of the market indicates that this is not the case. In comparison to the previous day, the price has decreased by 3.44%, and it is now trading at $10.04. The 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) are currently coming up at $13.072 and $14.071, respectively, which suggests that technical indicators point to a significantly more bearish situation than the current price. Analyst Advocates ‘Buy And Hold’ Approach In light of these contradictory signals, Santana has recommended a “buy and hold” strategy to LINK investors. In times of market depression and uncertainty, he suggests, it is the perfect time to start, as he stresses patience above complex technical analysis. Santana claims that these are the times when long-term investors could protect their holdings before the market becomes euphoric and greedy. This approach is especially pertinent considering Santana’s forecast that the prolonged accumulation period for LINK will filter out short-term investors. Once the next bull market starts, he thinks this screening process will set the stage for exponential expansion. Near-Term Trend Looking Up More information comes from the crypto prediction platform CoinCheckup. It shows that LINK will go up soon. The platform says that there could be a big 89% growth in the next six months, even though the market price is 3.15 % lower than what it predicted would happen in the next 30 days. This prediction is based on rising demand and positive developments in the Chainlink environment. Related Reading: ARB Surges Nearly 10% As Franklin Templeton Launches Fund on Arbitrum Looking forward, CoinCheckup also projects an 87.57% increase for LINK over the next year, which reflects ongoing investor confidence as the wider crypto market develops. The underperformance in the short term, however, points to possible volatility—probably either from market swings or investor profit-taking.

32228730,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=23974,1723219200,What is Wavlake?,"Wavlake is an innovative music and podcast streaming platform that uses the Bitcoin Lightning Network to enable direct, instant payments from fans to artists. By adopting a Value 4 Value model, Wavlake allows listeners to send micropayments in Bitcoin, known as “Boosts,” or “streaming Satoshis” directly to creators, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries. This decentralised approach ensures that artists receive fair compensation while fostering a closer connection with their audience. The platform’s focus on transparency and community-building aligns with the principles of P2P Bitcoin payments, making it a promising tool for reshaping the financial landscape of the music and podcast industries. A Lightning-Powered Streaming Platform to Give Spotify a Run for Its Money? Wavlake is a music and podcast streaming platform that leverages the Bitcoin Lightning Network to enable direct financial support from fans to artists. The platform utilises a Value 4 Value (V4V) model, where listeners can make micropayments, or “zaps,” in the form of Bitcoin to the creators they support. This decentralised approach allows artists to receive instant, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, bypassing traditional intermediaries and providing a more equitable revenue stream. The Lightning Network’s capabilities make transactions nearly instantaneous and cost-effective, fostering a more direct and meaningful connection between artists and their audiences. Wavlake’s integration of the Lightning Network provides artists with a novel way to monetise their content. Fans can boost tracks by sending small amounts of Bitcoin, reflecting their appreciation and directly impacting the platform’s trending charts. This system not only incentivises content discovery and engagement but also empowers artists to sustain their creative endeavours through a more transparent and fair financial model. Additionally, Wavlake’s use of the Lightning Network means that even minute payments are feasible, enabling a broader and more inclusive participation in supporting artists. One of the most important features of Wavlake is its alignment with Bitcoin’s focus as P2P digital cash, emphasising decentralisation and direct artist/fandom interactions. By using the Bitcoin Lightning Network, Wavlake ensures that financial transactions are secure, instant, transparent, and free from traditional financial gatekeepers. This model is particularly advantageous for independent musicians and podcasters who often struggle with the low payout rates of mainstream streaming services. The platform’s commitment to Lightning Network is integral to its innovative approach to reshaping the music and podcast industries. Wavlake’s platform not only facilitates monetary exchanges but also incorporates community-building elements. Listeners can send messages along with their boosts, creating a more interactive and engaging experience. This P2P model encourages a closer relationship between artists and fans, fostering a supportive community around content creation. As Wavlake continues to develop, it aims to inspire other developers to create new applications that are both artist-friendly and enjoyable for fans, potentially revolutionising the way digital content is consumed and monetised in the era of Bitcoin commerce. Is Wavlake a Better Alternative for Artists and Their Fans? Wavlake’s direct peer-to-peer model, leveraging the Lightning Network’s instant micropayments, offers a revolutionary compensation model for artists and fans alike. Traditional music industry structures often involve multiple intermediaries, such as record labels, distributors, and streaming platforms, which collectively take a significant portion of the revenue generated from an artist’s work. This leaves artists with only a fraction of the earnings their content produces. By enabling direct transactions between fans and artists, Wavlake eliminates these middlemen, ensuring that a larger share of the revenue goes directly to the creators. The typical contractual arrangements with record labels can be highly disadvantageous to artists. These contracts often include clauses that bind artists to long-term commitments and grant labels substantial control over their music, including rights to royalties, creative direction, and distribution. As a result, artists may see only a small percentage of the profits from their work after the label and other intermediaries take their cuts. Wavlake’s model allows artists to retain full ownership of their music and receive payments directly from their fans in real-time, without any contractual obligations that limit their control over their own creations. For fans, Wavlake’s model also presents significant benefits. The ability to directly support their favourite artists creates a more personal and meaningful connection. Fans can choose how much they want to contribute, knowing that their payments are going directly to the artist without being diluted by intermediaries. This transparency fosters a stronger sense of community and trust, as fans can see the immediate impact of their support on the artists they admire. Additionally, the use of Bitcoin and the Lightning Network ensures that these transactions are fast, secure, and borderless, making it easier for fans worldwide to support artists regardless of geographical limitations, even in micro amounts, which before Lightning, were economically unfeasible. Wavlake’s approach aligns with the broader cypherpunk philosophy of decentralisation and fairness inherent in the Bitcoin-based P2P economy. By utilising a decentralised network like Lightning for transactions, Wavlake reduces the risk of censorship and external control over artistic content. Artists can distribute their work freely, and fans can access and support content without the limitations imposed by traditional platforms. This model not only democratises the music industry but also sets a precedent for other creative fields, highlighting the potential of Bitcoin to transform how value is exchanged in the digital age. Was Wavlake Inspired by Adam Curry’s Podcasting 2.0 Movement? Adam Curry’s Podcasting 2.0 movement represents a significant advance for podcasters, aiming to decentralise the control of podcast distribution and monetisation from large platforms back to the creators and listeners. By introducing a framework that incorporates the Lightning Network and other free and open-source software technologies, Podcasting 2.0 empowers podcasters with more control over their content and how they monetise it. Key innovations of this movement include the integration of the Bitcoin Lightning Network for seamless micropayments, enhanced RSS feed capabilities, and new features like value-for-value transactions. This allows listeners to directly support podcasters in real time with small payments, fostering a closer connection between creators and their audiences. Inspired by the principles of Podcasting 2.0, Wavlake has adopted a similar strategy for its music and podcast streaming platform. This model eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries, such as record labels and large streaming platforms, which often take significant cuts from the revenue generated by artists. Wavlake’s approach ensures that a greater portion of the proceeds goes straight to the creators, aligning with the value-for-value ethos of Podcasting 2.0. One of the standout features inspired by Podcasting 2.0 is Wavlake’s “boosts,” which function similarly to YouTube’s superchats. These boosts allow fans not only to tip their favourite artists but also to leave paid comments and share their favourite content. This interactive model enhances the engagement between artists and their fans, providing a more dynamic and rewarding experience for both parties. The use of Bitcoin’s Lightning Network ensures that these transactions are instantaneous and borderless, allowing fans from around the world to participate in supporting and engaging with their favourite creators without friction. By adopting these innovative strategies, Wavlake is not only providing a fairer and more efficient compensation model for artists but also creating a vibrant, community-driven platform. The integration of P2P micropayments and boosts transforms the traditional streaming experience into one that is more interactive and directly beneficial to creators. This approach not only democratises the music and podcast industries but also sets a new standard for how digital content can be monetised and shared on the decentralised web. Inspired by Podcasting 2.0, Wavlake is pioneering a model that could reshape the future of digital content distribution and monetisation, empowering artists and fostering a more engaged and supportive fanbase.

32227665,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634307,1723217424,Toncoin Rally Above 4-Hour 100-Day SMA Puts TON On The Path To $7.6,"Toncoin (TON) has gained significant upward momentum, recently breaking above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the 4-hour chart. This bullish move signals strong buying interest that could potentially put the crypto asset on the path to the $7.6 resistance level. The breakout above this key technical indicator suggests that the bulls are in control, setting the stage for a continued rally. This article analyzes Toncoin’s recent breakout above the 100-day SMA on the 4-hour chart, assesses market sentiment, and evaluates the significance of the $7.6 resistance level as the next major target. Toncoin was trading at approximately $6.50, marking an increase of over 3.55%, with a market capitalization exceeding $16 billion and a trading volume of more than $960 million at the time of writing. Over the past 24 hours, the asset’s market cap has risen by over 3%, while its trading volume has surged by more than 36%. Market Sentiment: Bulls In Control Of TON’s Rally Currently, the price of Toncoin on the 4-hour chart has been on a bullish move advancing above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) toward the $7.6 resistance mark. The breach above this key indicator indicates continued bullish control and the potential for further upward movement. Additionally, a 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis reveals that the indicator’s signal line has successfully climbed above 50% and is now approaching the 70% mark, which is considered the overbought zone. This suggests that buying pressure is increasing, potentially leading to further upward movement for the asset. On the 1-day chart, although Toncoin is still trading below the 100-day SMA, it has successfully formed bullish momentum candlesticks, aiming for both the 100-day SMA and the $7.6 resistance level, which means that the bulls are still in control and could potentially push the price higher. Finally, on the 1-day chart, the RSI signal line has climbed more than 35% from the oversold zone and is currently approaching 50%, suggesting growing bullish momentum for the cryptocurrency. Potential Scenarios: Will Toncoin Reach $7.6 Or Face Rejection? In the event that TON’s price reaches and breaks above the $7.6 resistance level, the crypto asset could continue to rise, testing its all-time high of $8.30 and potentially setting a new all-time high once it surpasses this mark. However, if Toncoin reaches the $7.6 resistance level and faces a rebound, it might start to decline toward the $4.6 support mark. Should the price fall below this support, it could drop further to test the $3.3 support level and potentially continue to lower support ranges on the chart if the $3.3 price target is breached.

Recent actions by Dogecoin (DOGE) whales indicate that Mpeppe (MPEPE), a new entrant in the crypto world, is poised for a significant price surge. Here’s an in-depth look at why these large-scale investors are flocking to Mpeppe (MPEPE) and what it means for the future of this promising coin. Dogecoin Whales Shifting Focus: The Mpeppe (MPEPE) Attraction Dogecoin (DOGE) has long been a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts and investors, largely due to its vibrant community and the humorous nature of its origin. However, a notable trend is emerging: Dogecoin (DOGE) whales, who have previously dominated the Dogecoin (DOGE) market, are now turning their attention to Mpeppe (MPEPE). This shift suggests that Mpeppe (MPEPE) is attracting serious attention from those who have successfully navigated the volatile world of meme coins. The reasons behind this growing interest are multifaceted, involving both the unique attributes of Mpeppe (MPEPE) and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrency investments.

This move has sent ripples through the crypto community, particularly among Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts, who are closely watching the whale’s investment strategies. Ethereum Whale Shifts Focus to Emerging Tokens Ethereum (ETH) has long been a dominant force in the cryptocurrency market, serving as the backbone for countless decentralized applications and smart contracts. However, the recent price movements of Ethereum (ETH) have been a cause for concern among investors. After briefly rising, Ethereum (ETH) is now facing potential resistance levels, sparking fears of a possible downturn. As a result, some investors are diversifying their portfolios, seeking opportunities in promising new ICOs. The Appeal of PEPU and MPEPE The Ethereum (ETH) whale’s significant investment in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) signals a calculated strategy to tap into the expanding meme coin sector. Pepe Unchained (PEPU) stands out for its innovative approach, which combines the humor and community-driven spirit of meme coins with the practical benefits of advanced blockchain technology. By integrating Layer-2 capabilities, Pepe Unchained (PEPU) aims to overcome common issues like high transaction fees and sluggish processing times that plague many Ethereum-based tokens. This technological edge makes PEPU not just a meme coin, but a robust ecosystem that promises long-term value and functionality beyond its initial hype. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has quickly become a favorite among early investors due to its unique market positioning and strong presale momentum. The token’s distinct value proposition, which blends meme culture with emerging trends in the crypto space, has resonated with investors seeking to diversify their portfolios. MPEPE’s presale has shown impressive traction, underscoring the market’s appetite for fresh, high-potential projects that offer more than just speculative gains. The excitement surrounding Mpeppe (MPEPE) suggests that it could be on the cusp of becoming a major player in the meme coin arena, attracting attention from both retail and institutional investors alike. A Shift in Ethereum (ETH) Investment Strategy The whale’s move to invest in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) represents a broader trend among Ethereum (ETH) holders who are increasingly exploring opportunities in the ICO space. This shift comes as Ethereum faces a complex market environment, where potential resistance and broader market volatility have investors seeking new avenues for growth. By diversifying into promising ICOs like Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE), Ethereum investors are not just looking for quick profits, but also for projects that can offer sustainable returns and innovation within the crypto ecosystem. This trend highlights a changing mindset among Ethereum investors, who are beginning to look beyond the traditional top-tier cryptocurrencies. The investment in these emerging tokens suggests that even within the established Ethereum community, there is a recognition of the need to adapt and evolve investment strategies in response to the dynamic nature of the crypto market. As more investors follow this path, it could lead to a significant realignment of capital within the cryptocurrency space, with a greater emphasis on identifying and supporting projects that combine strong technological foundations with the viral appeal of meme culture. A Strategic Play for the Future The Ethereum (ETH) whale’s $1.5 million investment in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the potential for significant gains in the rapidly evolving crypto market. As Ethereum (ETH) holders watch the unfolding developments, the success of these ICOs could pave the way for more investments in similar projects. In conclusion, the whale’s bold move serves as a reminder that in the world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead of the curve often means taking calculated risks on new and promising ventures. With Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) showing strong presale performances, they could very well be the next big players in the crypto space, offering substantial returns for early investors.

This move has sent ripples through the crypto community, particularly among Ethereum (ETH) enthusiasts, who are closely watching the whale’s investment strategies. Ethereum Whale’s Strategic Shift to Emerging ICOs Ethereum (ETH) has long held its position as a powerhouse in the crypto world, serving as the backbone for numerous decentralized applications and smart contracts. However, recent fluctuations in Ethereum’s price have led some investors to reconsider their strategies. Facing potential resistance levels, ETH’s market performance has sparked concerns of a possible decline, prompting seasoned investors to seek out new opportunities in the cryptocurrency space. This shift in focus has led some to explore promising Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) that present high growth potential and innovative technology. Why the Focus on PEPU and MPEPE? The move by an Ethereum (ETH) whale to invest heavily in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) is a clear indication of the evolving trends in the market. PEPU, known as Pepe Unchained (PEPU), is gaining traction due to its forward-thinking use of Layer-2 solutions on the Ethereum network. This advanced approach is designed to improve transaction speeds, reduce fees, and offer a more refined user experience within the meme-coin sector. PEPU’s integration of cutting-edge technology with the playful appeal of meme coins makes it an attractive option for investors looking for both novelty and potential high returns. On the other hand, Mpeppe (MPEPE) has rapidly become a subject of interest among crypto investors. Its presale has shown strong momentum, with nearly all tokens in Stage 2 already claimed. The distinctive appeal of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its innovative positioning within the meme-coin landscape, promising fresh opportunities for those looking to capitalize on the next big trend. MPEPE’s ability to attract significant interest highlights its potential to emerge as a leading player in the evolving world of cryptocurrency. The Implications for Ethereum (ETH) For Ethereum (ETH) itself, this whale’s investment move could signal a broader trend. As ETH faces potential resistance around $2,843, according to recent technical analysis, there’s a noticeable shift towards newer, high-growth opportunities like Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE). This suggests that while Ethereum remains a fundamental part of the crypto landscape, investors are increasingly seeking out new avenues for even higher returns. The move into these emerging tokens could very well shape the investment strategies of savvy crypto players in the near future. A Strategic Play for the Future The Ethereum (ETH) whale’s $1.5 million investment in Pepe Unchained (PEPU) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) underscores the potential for significant gains in the rapidly evolving crypto market. As Ethereum (ETH) holders watch the unfolding developments, the success of these ICOs could pave the way for more investments in similar projects. In conclusion, the whale’s bold move serves as a reminder that in the world of cryptocurrency, staying ahead of the curve often means taking calculated risks on new and promising ventures. With PEPU and Mpeppe (MPEPE) showing strong presale performances, they could very well be the next big players in the crypto space, offering substantial returns for early investors.

32226623,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634386,1723214597,XRP Slowly Makes Its Way to $1 and Holders Spend Their Gains On New Cryptocurrency Mpeppe For Huge Profits,"Ripple (XRP) is experiencing a significant resurgence in the crypto market, making a steady climb toward the $1 mark. Despite recent legal battles, including a hefty $125 million fine imposed by a judge, Ripple has managed to turn the tides in its favor. The Ripple (XRP) price has surged by an impressive 20% following the court ruling, with a weekly gain of 42%. This resurgence has renewed optimism among XRP holders, many of whom are now looking to capitalize on their gains by exploring new opportunities in the crypto space. One such opportunity that has caught their attention is Mpeppe (MPEPE), a promising new cryptocurrency with the potential for massive profits. Ripple (XRP) Bounces Back Amid Legal Challenges The recent legal battles have been a mixed bag for Ripple. While the $125 million fine was a significant blow, the outcome of the case was seen as a partial victory for the company and its supporters. Ripple’s XRP was not classified as a security, a key point of contention in the lawsuit brought by the SEC. This ruling has provided some clarity for XRP and its future, helping to drive its price upward. Ripple’s price rally has been described by some analysts as a “Dead Cat Bounce,” a term used to describe a temporary recovery in an asset’s price after a substantial decline. Despite the skepticism, on-chain data reveals that Ripple (XRP) demand remains strong, with investors taking advantage of the price surge. However, the market remains cautious, with the possibility of further declines on the horizon. The current market value-to-realized value (MVRV) ratio suggests that XRP may be overvalued, leading some investors to consider selling their holdings for profit. Mpeppe (MPEPE): The New Crypto on the Block As Ripple (XRP) continues to climb, many XRP holders are looking to diversify their portfolios by investing in new, high-potential cryptocurrencies. Mpeppe (MPEPE) has emerged as a top contender, offering the potential for substantial profits. This new gambling-focused meme coin is capturing the attention of investors with its unique value proposition and the promise of significant returns. Mpeppe (MPEPE) stands out in the crowded crypto market with its innovative approach to decentralized finance (DeFi) gaming. With a focus on gambling, MPEPE taps into a lucrative niche, offering investors a chance to participate in a rapidly growing sector. The smart contract address 0xd328a1C97e9b6b3Afd42eAf535bcB55A85cDcA7B ensures transparency and security for investors, further boosting confidence in this new token. Why XRP Holders Are Moving to Mpeppe The allure of Mpeppe (MPEPE) lies in its potential for exponential growth. With analysts predicting that MPEPE could offer huge returns, possibly even 1000x, it’s no wonder that XRP holders are flocking to this new token. The combination of XRP’s recent gains and the prospect of even greater profits with Mpeppe (MPEPE) is proving irresistible for many investors. Moreover, as Ripple (XRP) nears the $1 mark, some holders see Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a way to maximize their gains while diversifying their investments. With the crypto market known for its volatility, spreading risk across different assets is a smart strategy. Mpeppe’s focus on gambling and DeFi offers a unique opportunity that complements the more established presence of Ripple in the market. The Road Ahead for Ripple (XRP) and Mpeppe (MPEPE) As Ripple continues its journey towards $1, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if it can sustain its momentum. The recent legal victory has given XRP a boost, but challenges remain, and the market is still rife with uncertainty. For Mpeppe (MPEPE), the future looks bright. With growing interest from XRP holders and other investors, this new meme coin is poised to make a significant impact in the DeFi gaming space. The combination of innovative features, strong community support, and the potential for massive profits makes Mpeppe a compelling investment for those looking to capitalize on the next big thing in crypto. In conclusion, as Ripple (XRP) inches closer to the $1 milestone, its holders are increasingly turning to Mpeppe (MPEPE) as a way to amplify their profits. The blend of established strength in XRP and the exciting prospects of Mpeppe offers a dynamic duo for investors looking to navigate the ever-changing crypto landscape.

This bullish sentiment was again on display as this institutional investor sent $445 million USDT to exchanges to buy more crypto. Cumberland Sends $445 Million USDT To Exchanges The on-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post that crypto trading firm Cumberland has deposited the $445 million it received from the Tether Treasury into different exchanges. Data from the on-chain analytics platform Arkham Intelligence shows that Cumberland used the USDT funds to buy more crypto, with Bitcoin accounting for most of the firm’s purchases in the last 24 hours. Related Reading: Ripple Vs. SEC Lawsuit Ends: Will The XRP Price Cross $3 Once More? During this period, Cumberland has withdrawn a significant amount of Bitcoin from various exchanges, including Coinbase, Robinhood, and OKX, among others. This development coincides with the flagship crypto’s recent break above $60,000, highlighting the increased buying pressure that Bitcoin has witnessed thanks to institutional investors like Cumberland. The Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers have also bought a significant amount of Bitcoin in the last 24 hours, thanks to the net inflows recorded on August 8. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds witnessed net inflows of $194.6 million that day. This was the second consecutive day of net inflows for these funds, having witnessed inflows of $45.1 million on August 7. Some other investors, including retail investors, showed confidence in Bitcoin and the broader crypto market during this recent market crash. Lookonchain noted that Binance experienced a net inflow of $2.4 billion since the market drop on August 5. This includes a net inflow of $1.33 billion USDT and $519 million USDC, as these investors looked to buy more crypto and add to their positions. What Next For Bitcoin? Bitcoin is back above $60,000 following its drop below $50,000 on August 5. Considering there are still concerns on the macro side, there are fears that this Bitcoin rebound might be a relief bounce rather than a bullish reversal. However, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto is convinced that Bitcoin has found its bottom and is set to enjoy an uptrend from here on. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Identifies Mid-Cap Altcoin Set To Surge 1,100% In a recent X post, he again alluded to the Volatility Index (VIX), which he noted gives all signs that the macro bottom is in. He remarked that the next markup phase will be “violent.” In the meantime, Bitcoin holding above $60,600 will be key to confirming this bullish reversal. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that continued stability above this level would allow Bitcoin to revisit the $65,000 price level over time. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $60,900, up over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This can be attributed to the market’s surprising rally, complemented by a market cap that is up by over 6% after its dip earlier this week.

This will grow the Injective user base to not only include retail investors and crypto enthusiasts. It will help the platform grow more maturely, getting institutional-level attention through the use of its robust network while also benefiting from Utila’s strong security as well. With interest in crypto increasing in traditional finance, the growing convenience of onboarding crypto into their portfolios will make a huge difference. This has occurred already, with more and more crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being announced since then. INJ Trading At A Trendline Pointing Upward Looking at INJ’s chart, the token is currently situated on its late-November 2023 level that preceded the December rally occurring that same year. If it were to happen again, investors might see huge gains in the long term as the market warms up for more action. However, INJ bulls are facing slight resistance on $18.02 as the candle flips red. This difficulty might slow the bullish momentum, lowering volatility as the token floats between $18.02 and $21.16. A slight pause might transpire in the short term as bulls take advantage of the low volatility to gain momentum once more.

If the price of major cryptocurrencies are in fact in a short squeeze, investors will inevitably feel pain in the long run.

However, slight ambiguity remains in using XRP in Ripple's on-demand liquidity service. Ripple is slammed with a $125 million civil penalty and a generic injunction order for further securities sales. Despite the latest ruling, prospects of a spot XRP ETF remain slim, as no issuer has shown interest in filing for one, and demand for existing XRP ETPs remains weak. The latest ruling could potentially spark some institutional interest in existing XRP ETPs as XRP gains more legal clarity. The long-awaited resolution has arrived in the years-long, most-watched legal brawl in the crypto space. The long-standing legal brawl between the SEC and Ripple reached a final decision yesterday, with a fairly favorable outcome for Ripple ( XRP-USD ). In the past year, the SEC’s main contention in the Ripple case has attenuated, following Judge Analisa Torres’ split decision ruling , last year in July, that absolved Ripple Labs of violating federal securities laws by selling XRP on public exchanges. The judge, however, ruled that Ripple, on the other hand, violated federal securities laws by selling XRP directly to institutional investors. The July 2023 victory saw XRP surge as high as 75% and Coinbase ( COIN ) which had suspended the trading of XRP on its platform since January 2021 (in the light of the SEC’s case), relisted and resumed the trade of XRP. Ripple’s resolve in the case has strengthened since that ruling. The SEC filed an interlocutory appeal months later on the July 2023 ruling, but the appeal was subsequently denied. The SEC also subsequently dropped its charges against Ripple execs Brad Garlinghouse and Christen Larson last October. The SEC-Ripple case had become some sort of “proxy war” between the crypto community and regulators, and this latest outcome is a pivotal step toward regulatory clarity. In a time when institutional investors are gaining direct exposure through the approval of crypto spot ETFs, regulatory clarity regarding the securities or non-securities status of a crypto asset is becoming a top consideration for crypto investors. The regulatory classification of a crypto asset is a foremost criterion for a potential spot ETF consideration. Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows and BTC spot price trend correlation (Bloomberg) We have witnessed the direct benefits of a crypto asset gaining institutional exposure. The spot Bitcoin and spot Ethereum ETF approvals have shown that institutional demand for the spot ETFs directly correlates to demand for the underlying crypto asset, which in turn potentially puts upward pressure on price. Since approval, the spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have correlated with the spot price trend of Bitcoin. A Spot XRP ETF, Anyone? I initially considered the spot Bitcoin ETF approval a “fluke occurrence” and anticipated that it would take a while to see such approval for another crypto asset, considering the several rejections and the lengthy back-and-forth between regulators and applicants before the spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved on January 10th. Remember that one of the catalysts for the approval was Grayscale’s litigation against the SEC for denying the conversion of its future-based ETP fund into a spot ETF. Somewhat surprisingly, a second spot ETF approval for a crypto asset - the spot Ethereum ETF - came sooner than anticipated (just about five months after the spot Bitcoin ETFs), and the approval proceedings between the regulator and applicants went more smoothly. In my coverage of Ethereum after its spot ETF approval, I noted that another crypto spot ETF approval is unlikely to happen soon due to the lack of regulatory clarity on most of the major crypto assets. I, however, personally believe that it is likely a wrap for crypto spot ETF approval in the U.S. for this market cycle (or at least for this year) because the regulatory status of most major altcoins remains ambiguous at the moment. Excerpt from previous Ethereum coverage The biggest hurdle to XRP’s institutional acceptance was the unclear regulatory classification of the asset. With the latest regulatory clarity that XRP has gained, I won't rule out XRP as a potential next candidate for a spot ETF. I am, however, very cautiously optimistic about the prospect of an XRP ETF approval. So far, no issuer has shown any interest in an XRP spot ETF filing. Ripple CEO has expressed optimism about the prospects of a spot XRP ETF , calling it “inevitable.” 2023 digital asset fund flows (CoinShares) XRP has historically seen much less flow into its ETPs compared to peers like Solana ( SOL-USD ). Last year’s flows report by CoinShares shows XRP saw a paltry $18 million in flows, while Solana recorded $167 million. In terms of AuM Solana surpassed XRP by $762 million. YTD (Jan. - Aug. 2024) digital asset fund flows (CoinShares) So far this year, XRP has seen $21 million in YTD flows, with $100 million in AuM. While SOL has recorded $66 million in net flows and a $1.46 billion kn AuM. My comparison of XRP and SOL is driven by the fact that Solana is also considered a potential next contender for a spot ETF and both assets are in the top 10 cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap. For us, both in terms of investability and also what we hear from our clients, Bitcoin and Ethereum definitely meet that bar, but it will be a while before we see anything else Samara Cohen, BlackRock's CIO for ETF and Index Investments Above are the words of Samara Cohen, BlackRock's Chief Investment Officer for ETF and Index Investments, regarding the prospects of other crypto assets spot ETFs. Going by what Cohen said, client demand and investability are top factors in issuers’ consideration for spot ETFs. I think XRP doesn't meet the bar yet in terms of client demand, judging by the flow records and AuM size in its existing ETPs. Another angle I view this from is that the years-long legal case and ambiguity surrounding XRP regulatory status might have been a contributing factor that stifled the asset demand growth among traditional investors. The latest regulatory clarity may now give traditional investors the confidence to engage with XRP ETPs. Overall, the latest ruling is a win for Ripple. Though it comes with a $125 civil penalty against Ripple , it is still a far cry from the $2 billion penalty initially sought by the SEC. While this ruling is likely the complete close of the case, the SEC could still appeal the ruling in a 60-day window. Furthermore, precise clarity is also expected particularly regarding the use of XRP in Ripple's On-Demand Liquidity (“ODL”) service. Ripple had earlier in April discontinued the use of XRP for U.S.-based ODL transactions as part of regulatory compliance. Ripple replaced XRP with USDT ( USDT-USD ) stablecoin as ODL bridge currency. This marked a setback for one of the main use cases of XRP in the Ripple ecosystem. For readers not familiar with Ripple’s ODL, it is an instant liquidity solution provided by Ripple for cross-border transaction settlements facilitated through the XRP ledger, in which XRP serves as an instant source of liquidity and a bridge currency. For example, when an institution processes cross-border payment in its local currency, say the U.S. dollar, the local currency is instantly converted into XRP. The converted XRP is then transferred via the XRP Ledger anywhere in the globe. The converted XRP is then converted to the recipient's local currency. This process is like a replacement for traditional nostro accounts. Ripple Labs recently announced that it will launch a stablecoin later this year. The Ripple USD (RLUSD) will be launched on both XRP Ledger and Ethereum. This will apparently replace the current use of USDT for U.S.-based ODL settlements. With these developments, XRP holders need to monitor future workarounds that Ripple might present in its use of XRP in U.S.-based ODL. Though a majority of ODL transactions currently occur outside the U.S. (hence not subject to U.S. laws) it is still important for XRP investors to monitor Ripple's strategies and potential workarounds concerning the use of XRP in U.S.-based ODL, staying informed about any shifts in Ripple's operational approach and their impact on XRP's role and utility within the Ripple ecosystem. The long-term implication of these changes could influence XRP’s demand and price. My earlier coverage of Ripple in February came with a “buy” rating. In that article, I highlighted how asset tokenization presents fresh opportunities for Ripple. Asset tokenization has seen steady growth and the XRP Ledger is becoming an active network for issuance of tokenized assets. Last week Ripple announced a tokenized version of the U.S. Treasury bills launching on XRPL. The XRP Ledger is purpose-built for institutional-grade financial use cases, and its prospects as a potential go-to platform for asset tokenization still hold, in my view. Bottom Line Ripple still holds prospects as a top crypto. However, I believe that the use case of XRP in the Ripple ecosystem still needs proper delineation. Moreso, considering the soon-to-be-launched RLUSD stablecoin, XRP’s prominence in the Ripple ecosystem could recede, especially in U.S.-based settlements. I also believe that a spot XRP ETF isn't likely to be approved anytime soon. These factors prompt my decision to adjust downward to a “hold” rating for now.",NEUTRAL,BTC | XRP,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4712668-ripple-long-standing-sec-lawsuit-ends-what-this-means-for-xrp?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32223522.jpeg

Risk assets stabilized as upbeat weekly U.S. jobs data eased recession concerns.  Observers cite $61,800 and $54,000 as key levels to watch out for in the near term.  Bitcoin's {{BTC}} price recovery from Monday's rout has gathered pace and how.  The cryptocurrency surged nearly 12% to $61,720 on Thursday alone, the biggest single-day UTC gain since Feb. 28, 2022, when prices rallied over 14%, according to charting platform TradingView. The total crypto market capitalization rose 11% to $2.11 trillion, the biggest jump since Nov. 10, 2022.  Most gains happened during the U.S. trading hours as better-than-expected U.S. jobless claims data eased recession fears, pushing U.S. stocks higher. Wall Street's fear index, VIX, fell to 23, offering positive cues to risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. More importantly, the rally in the anti-risk Japanese yen stalled as the Bank of Japan pushed back against near-term rate hikes.  The U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amassed $194.6 million in investor funds, the highest tally since July 2022, according to Farside Investors. BlackRock's IBIT alone drew $157.6 million in investments.  Stocks and bitcoin began losing ground last week after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, triggering an unwinding of the yen carry trades and concerns grew about the U.S. economy. The selling became so intense on Monday that BTC dipped to $50,000 at one point, having peaked near $70,000 just a week ago.  According to blockchain analytics firm Santiment, whales or wallets with large BTC holdings accumulated the cryptocurrency during Monday's price crash.  ""August 5th and 6th saw the highest level of Bitcoin whale transactions since the first week of April. According to the total holdings of wallets with 10 to 1,000 BTC, they rapidly accumulated on the price dip that saw crypto's top asset fall below $50K,"" Santiment said on X.  Looking ahead, $61,800 is the level to beat for the bulls, according to Alex Kuptsikevich, senior market analyst at FxPro.  ""The ability to close above this at $61.8K could encourage buyers to rally quickly to $67K. A retreat from this level would set up a scenario of a return to the area of the sustained July and August lows near $55.5K,"" Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in an email, adding that $61,800 marks the confluence of the 50- and 200-day simple moving averages.  Per Investment Advisor Two Prime, the bias remains bullish while prices hold support at $54,000, and geopolitical issues and the Fed policy hold the key to the next big price moves.  ""We continue to watch $54K as a major support area, followed by $50K. So far, these levels remain intact, and there has been persistent demand each time bitcoin has reached this area,"" Two Prime said in a Telegram note to clients.

42390643,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4dZz,1723205168,"First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Reclaims $62K, Bulls Revisit $100K Target","This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,961 +3.6% Bitcoin (BTC): $60,680 +5.8% Ether (ETC): $2,636 +7.7% S&P 500: 5,319.31 +2.3% Gold: $2,468 +1.9% Nikkei 225: 35,025 +0.56%  Top Stories  Bitcoin briefly returned to $62,000 during the Asian morning as the crypto market extended its recovery from the rout at the start of the week. BTC subsequently dropped to trade just above $60,500, over 5.5% higher than 24 hours ago. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20) has risen by around 3.9%, with ether the biggest gainer, up almost 7.75% at $2,540. Crypto assets are mirroring the U.S. stock market, which is similarly recovering from Monday's slump. The S&P 500 had its best day since November 2022 on Thursday while the Nasdaq 100 rose 3.1%.  BTC's rally in the latter part of this week has seen nearly $100 million in shorts liquidated, with some analysts saying bitcoin's dramatic slumps are now behind it. With the Bank of Japan's indication that it will not raise interest rates further and selling pressure from Jump Trading drying up, BTC is unlikely to drop below $50,000, according to Transform Ventures founder Michael Terpin. “Regardless of the next 60 days, the bull market will continue along traditional four-year cycle lines with solid gains in October and November,” he added. Terpin also repeated the position of many analysts that a Donald Trump win in November's presidential election could see BTC surge to over $100,000.  Ionic Digital, the bitcoin miner that bought bankrupt crypto lender Celsius' mining assets, has delayed a plan to go public after losing its CEO and auditor. Former CEO Matt Prusak told the company in July he won't stay on after the end of his employment term on Aug. 14, the miner said in a statement Thursday. Ionic has started searching for a new CEO and named its recently hired CFO, John Penver, the interim boss. Penver was hired in July to shepherd the company's plan to go public. Ionic said that despite the leadership change, it still intends to conduct an initial public offering and is ""confident"" Penver will be able to lead the company to that goal.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows bitcoin's short-term and long-term skews, measuring the price differential between call and put options.  Seven-day and one-month skews hold below zero, signaling persistent demand for protective puts in the wake of Thursday's 12% price surge.  It's a sign traders remain fearful of a price swoon.

32221543,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634210,1723201251,"Bitcoin Price Soars Above $62,000 Again: Top 3 Reasons","The Bitcoin price records a major rally in recent days. After plummeting to a low of $49,000 on Monday, the BTC price soared as high as $62,700 during the Asian trading session today. Thus, BTC has surged 24% from its Monday low. Over the last 24 hours alone, BTC has risen by 7%. These are the key reasons: #1 Fading US Recession Fears Fuel Bitcoin Rally Macro economics are the clear driver of the price move as equities have rallied along with Bitcoin. Notably, the July unemployment rate in the United States increased to 4.3%, the highest in the last four months. This triggered concerns about a potential recession, as per the Sahm Rule. This economic indicator suggests that a recession might be starting if the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more relative to its lowest point in the previous 12 months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bull Run Still Intact? Here’s What On-Chain Data Says The initial panic was exacerbated by a jobs report that fell short of expectations, with only 114,000 new jobs compared to the anticipated 175,000. However, the narrative shifted dramatically yesterday with the latest release of jobless claims data. A significant drop to 233,000, down by 17,000, marked the largest decline in almost a year, soothing jittery markets. Mohamed A. El-Erian, President of Queens College Cambridge and chief economic adviser at Allianz, explained via X that the global financial markets reacted to the data release and interpreted it as “a relief after last week’s unemployment and growth scare.” However, he also warned that “that this high-frequency data series is inherently noisy.” US weekly jobless claims came in at 233,000, down from a revised 250,000 — a relief after last week’s unemployment and growth scare. The details of this data release will be subject to a higher level of scrutiny with a view to assessing breadth and other distributional aspects.… https://t.co/fBqaJVs3sM — Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) August 8, 2024 Macro analyst Alex Krüger further elaborated that “the market crash triggered by last week’s unemployment & payrolls data has now fully reversed, after today’s weekly jobless claims data. Price action and new jobs data confirm what I suspected: that the whole equities market had a crypto style levered flush-out, driven mostly by positioning, narrative and mass hysteria, and not as much by fundamentals.” Related Reading: MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor Reveals Bitcoin Holdings Top $1 Billion Krüger also cautioned against overemphasis on single data points: “There’s a reason the Fed makes emphasis on making no decisions on single data points. Payrolls data can be very noisy. Yet last Friday much of the market went on a crazy rampage calling for a policy mistake and emergency rate cuts.” #2 Short Liquidations Amplify BTC Surge The volatility in Bitcoin’s price also catalyzed a significant number of short liquidations. In the past 24 hours alone, 52,413 traders were liquidated, with total crypto liquidations reaching $222.02 million, according to Coinglass data. For Bitcoin specifically, over $90 million in short positions were liquidated, marking it as the third-highest short-liquidation event in the past five months. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, clarified the impact of these liquidations on the market: “This Bitcoin bounce has been mostly shorts covering positions in the futures market. Open interest down, prices up.” #3 MicroStrategy Buying? As the Bitcoin price climbed higher, there was a notable surge in demand from the spot market. Crypto analyst Kiarash Hossainpour speculated, “You heard it here first: I could imagine this crazy late night market buy coming from none other than Saylor. The guy just announced another $2 billion buy the other day. Who else buys in the illiquid hours after the US close on a Thursday night? Exactly, nobody.” MicroStrategy, under the leadership of Michael Saylor, announced last week plans to increase its Bitcoin holdings significantly, preparing to raise $2 billion through a new at-the-market equity offering as reported in its Q2 2024 earnings report. The company stated: “We continue to closely manage our equity capital, and are filing a registration statement for a new $2 billion at-the-market equity offering program.” At press time, BTC traded at $61,186.

SUI is one of those tokens, gaining almost 31% in the past 24 hours as major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum returned to pre-correction levels. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Looking Stronger – ‘Expect Massive Gains’, Analyst Predicts As the market continues to rally, SUI might continue to capture the broader momentum, keeping the bears at bay. This comes after institutional interest hit the Sui platform, which will also help drive the price upward. Grayscale Releases New Funds On SUI And TAO In a press release by Grayscale, the crypto asset manager announced the launch of investment trusts based on SUI and TAO: the Grayscale SUI Trust and the Grayscale TAO Trust. The move is a complete vote of confidence with the Head of Product & Research, Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, being quoted saying: “We are excited to add Bittensor and Sui to our product suite, and believe Bittensor is at the center of the growth of decentralized AI, while Sui is redefining the smart contract blockchain.” This is big news not just for SUI and TAO, but for the entire crypto market as a whole. With WisdomTree CEO, Jonathan Steinberg, saying that crypto will continue to be mainstream in the coming years in an interview with CNBC last month, these new institutional investment products will leverage the growing and solidifying interest in crypto and blockchain tech. With an increase in trade volume interpreted as an increase in both retail and institutional interest in crypto, SUI might have a great second half of the year to boot. Choppy Trading Days Ahead, But Not Enough To Stop SUI SUI bulls are currently trying to settle above the $0.8357 ceiling to flip it to become a support platform. This move comes after the token suddenly skyrocketed in the face of the market’s rally. With the end of the week approaching, investors and traders might encounter some resistance above this price level introducing some choppy days before a high chance of a continuation rally long-term. However, the high volatility in the market might also help the bears in the long run. Related Reading: Polkadot Developments Show Strength, Despite Coin’s 18% Loss SUI: Crypto In Bearish Mode The current price of SUI is in historically bearish territory, with bulls struggling to make headway since the price retreat between May and June. This situation remains a significant issue for investors and traders. But if the market continues to rally in the long term, more gains will be awaiting SUI. But if the market continues to rally in the long term, more gains will be awaiting SUI. The growing interest in crypto and in both the retail and institutional investor space will heavily contribute to this.

32218789,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634172,1723194001,"Bitcoin Nears $60,000 As Putin Signs Law Legalizing Crypto Mining In Russia","In a significant boost for the largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin (BTC) has surged nearly 9% in the last 24 hours, inching closer to the coveted $60,000 milestone. This price rally comes after BTC hit a 7-month low of $49,000 earlier this week amid broader market uncertainty. Fueling this crypto resurgence is a significant development in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has officially signed a law legalizing cryptocurrency mining in the country. Russia Formalizes Crypto Mining Rules According to a local media report, the new law introduces several legal concepts related to the crypto mining industry, including digital currency mining, mining pool, mining infrastructure operator, address identifier, and the person who organizes mining pool activities. In particular, the law recognizes mining as a component of digital currency turnover rather than the issuance of the currency itself, paving the way for a regulated and controlled crypto-mining ecosystem in Russia. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Forecasts XRP Price Path Post-SEC Lawsuit Resolution Under the new law, only Russian legal entities and individual entrepreneurs in a special register will have the right to mine cryptocurrencies. However, individuals who do not exceed the government-set energy consumption limits can engage in mining without being part of the register. The legislation also allows for the trading of foreign digital financial assets on Russian blockchain platforms while granting the Central Bank of Russia the authority to ban the placement of individual digital currency issues if they pose a threat to the country’s financial stability. The move by the Russian government aligns with President Putin’s previous statements, where he acknowledged the promising economic potential of digital currencies and the importance of Russia “seizing the moment” to create the necessary legal framework and infrastructure for the circulation of digital assets. The new law is set to come into force 10 days after its official publication, with some provisions subject to different effective dates. Bitcoin Price Targets In Focus In an analysis of the recent price action, technical analyst Crypto Con claims that Bitcoin has recently bounced off the “Level 2” of the Magic Bands at $55,444 and is maintaining its trajectory toward the Level 3 target, which now stands at $94,302. Crypto Con further notes that this also means that the cycle top band has risen to the $128,000 mark, with the analyst also claiming that this top will “grow much more” as the price conquers new all-time highs. Related Reading: Polkadot (DOT) Bulls Push Toward $4.8 Resistance, Breakout Ahead? In a parallel analysis, analyst Rekt Capital has weighed in on Bitcoin’s current price dynamics, noting the cryptocurrency’s continued upward momentum as it consolidates around the $59,000 mark. According to Rekt’s analysis, regaining $60,600 as a support level is crucial for the Bitcoin price to solidify its current bullish trend further and potentially climb to the $65,000 threshold.

42390640,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4dFT,1723192704,Here's Why XRP Whales May Prefer U.S. Exchanges Over Offshore Venues,"XRP's order book on U.S. exchanges is 30% more liquid than offshore platforms.  The greater the liquidity or market depth, the easier to execute large transactions at stable prices.  XRP is having its moment not just in terms of price rally but also enhanced liquidity on U.S. exchanges, a positive development for whales looking to trade large quantities at stable prices stateside.  As of Thursday, U.S. exchanges, including Nasdaq-listed Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken, boasted a 1% market depth of $1.12 million, offering 30% greater order book liquidity than offshore exchanges like Binance and OKX, according to data tracked by CCData.  In other words, a trade transaction worth at least $1.12 million must go through U.S. exchanges to move the spot price by 1% in either direction. A relatively smaller amount could do the same on offshore exchanges.  The 1% market depth on U.S. avenues has increased 53% since July last year, outpacing the 43.2% improvement on offshore platforms.  Market depth refers to the market's capacity to handle large buy and sell orders without causing significant fluctuation in the concerned asset's going market price. The depth is quantified by analyzing the number of active buy and sell orders at various price levels.  The 1% depth, which focuses on orders within the 1% range of the currency market rate, is widely used to assess liquidity conditions. The greater the depth, the easier it is to execute large orders with minimal slippage and vice versa.  Trading volume in XRP markets offered by U.S. exchanges has also picked up, although offshore exchanges remain dominant. U.S. platforms' now account for 14% of the global XRP volume, matching the levels seen four years ago, according to Paris-based Kaiko.  The relative improvement in trading conditions on the U.S. exchanges likely stems from dwindling regulatory uncertainty.  ""Since last year's landmark court ruling, which granted Ripple Labs a partial victory against the SEC, demand for XRP in U.S. markets has grown steadily,"" Kaiko said in a weekly note.  Last year, fintech company Ripple scored a partial victory in its long-pending battle against the Securities and Exchange Commission after a court ruled that Ripple's Institutional sales of the XRP, and not sales to retail investors, amounted to an unregistered securities offering. The regulator sued Ripple for violating securities law in late 2020, leading to the XRP price crash and prompting the U.S. exchanges to delist the token.  Early this week, a federal court imposed a $125 million penalty on Ripple for its institutional sales of XRP. The amount, however, fell well short of the $2 billion the SEC had sought, sending XRP's price higher by 20%.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/08/09/heres-why-xrp-whales-may-prefer-us-exchanges-over-offshore-venues,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d37bbac6dc728e5e88d07a1e483b5082f224324d-1565x608.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

32216094,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634108,1723186813,Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Gives Bottom Signal: What Happened Last 2 Times,"On-chain data shows that the Bitcoin Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Golden Cross has dipped into the bottom region, which may be bullish for the asset’s price. Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross Has Seen A Sharp Decline Recently As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post explained, the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross is giving a bottom signal for the third time in 2024. The “NVT ratio” is an on-chain metric that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and transaction volume. When the value of this metric is high, it means the asset’s value (that is, the market cap) is high when compared to the network’s ability to transact coins (the transaction volume). Such a trend could imply the BTC price is overvalued. Related Reading: XRP Sharks & Whales Push Bags To ATH As Price Rockets 19% On the other hand, the low indicator suggests the market cap is low compared to the transfer volume, so the cryptocurrency’s price could have room for growth. In the context of the current topic, a modified version of the NVT ratio is the actual indicator of relevance: the NVT Golden Cross. This metric compares the short-term trend of the metric with its long-term one to determine the appearances of local tops and bottoms in the NVT ratio. More particularly, the 10-day moving average (MA) stands for the short-term trend and the 30-day MA for the long-term. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross over the over the past few months: In the graph, the quant has highlighted the two regions of the NVT Golden Cross that have historically been relevant for cryptocurrency. At values above 2.2, the asset can be assumed to be close to the top, as here, the short-term trend of the NVT ratio has significantly surpassed its long-term one. Similarly, the zone under -1.6 is where bottoms can probably form. From the chart, it’s visible that the indicator has observed a plunge recently as the Bitcoin price itself has crashed down. The metric has entered the latter region, suggesting that the coin may have become underpriced. This is the third time that the NVT Golden Cross has breached this territory this year, with the first instance occurring back in January, during the price drawdown that had followed the spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval. This period of the asset being undervalued was followed by a rally towards the new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Jumps 39% From Crash Low, But Is This Rally Sustainable? The second instance of the indicator entering the bottoming zone was last month, with the low paving the way for a rally toward $70,000. Given that both of these occurrences proved bullish for Bitcoin, it remains to be seen where this third one leads. BTC Price Bitcoin has furthered its recovery during the past day as its price has now broken back above the $58,200 mark.

The token registered a 200% surge in the last six months, flipping Dogecoin (DOGE) by market capitalization. As a result, the crypto exchange Binance announced the listing of TON on August 8, which propelled the price by over 10%. Related Reading: Ethereum On The Move: Dormant ETH Wallets Linked To $4 Billion Scam Awaken Toncoin Soars 14% After Binance Listing On Thursday, Binance, the largest crypto exchange by trading volume, announced it would list TON on the trading platform. The exchange stated that the seed tag, used for projects with higher volatility and risks than others, would be applied to the token. Binance announced it would open trading for four new spot trading pairs on August 8 at 10:00 UTC. The pairs include TON/BTC, TON/USDT, TON/FDUSD, and TON/TRY. Additionally, the exchange added Toncoin to Binance Simple Earn, “Buy Crypto,” and Binance Convert. Meanwhile, TON withdrawals won’t be available until Friday. The telegram-integrated token will also be added to Binance’s Margin and Auto-Invest services on Monday, August 12. Following the listing, Toncoin saw an initial 14% increase, reclaiming the $6 support zone. The token surged to the $6.4 area before retracing to the $6.3 mark. Moreover, TON’s market activity increased by over 239% in the last 24 hours, with a daily trading volume of $1.3 billion. TON Tests Key Levels Following the recent surge, investors and market watchers have weighed in on TON’s price action. Trader AltCryptoGems highlighted that Toncoin was “outperforming today” with a “very nice pump from support.” Per the chart, TON bounced from the $5.4 support area to the $6.3 resistance level. If the token fails to reclaim this level, its price could lose momentum and dip to the previous support zone or lower. However, a successful retest of the key $6.3 mark could drive the price above $6.4. This could lead the token to break out of the downtrend line and propel the price towards TON’s ATH. The trader suggested avoiding “chasing green candles, especially above key resistance levels.” Instead, he advised that investors monitor the token’s reaction as “it is an interesting area to do some business.” Similarly, Altcoin Sherpa warned investors about TON despite being bullish. To the analyst, it’s “still a great chain/project.” However, Sherpa considers that the project needs more adoption even if “there are a lot of builders going on there lately.” “I think TON is still bullish for this cycle but wouldn’t be rushing to buy at current prices,” stated the analyst.

42390632,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4caR,1723182582,Bitcoin Bulls Revisit $100K Year-End Target as BTC Spikes Over $62K,"Bitcoin surged over $62,000 briefly before retreating, following a broad market rally that reversed steep losses from earlier in the week.  Some analysts predicted a $100,000 target for the cryptocurrency later this year.  The rally was influenced by favorable stock market sentiment and expectations of bitcoin mirroring its past market cycles, with liquidated short positions contributing to the surge.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} briefly spiked over $62,000 before retreating during the Asian morning hours on Friday as the broader market rallied to reverse a steep rout from earlier in the week. The recovery has some bitcoin bulls revisiting their $100,000 year-end target.  U.S. markets rallied on Thursday with the S&P 500 marking its best day since November 2022 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 rising 3.1%. This helped reverse losses from a Monday rout, which saw major losses across stock indexes and cryptocurrencies.  BTC jumped 7.2% in the past 24 hours, one of its biggest single-day percentage gains in recent months. The move liquidated nearly $100 million in shorts, or bearish bets, on bitcoin-tracked futures. The $100 million liquidation was the fourth largest hit for bitcoin bearish bets this year.  Some market watchers attributed the gains to favorable stock market sentiment and expectations of BTC mirroring its past market cycles.  ""Now that the Bank of Japan has indicated they will not raise interest rates further — and Jump Trading will run out of coins to sell, just like Germany did a few weeks ago — I do not see the price going much below $50,000 (other than a quick wick), perhaps ever again,” Transform Ventures founder Michael Terpin told CoinDesk in an email Friday.  “Regardless of the next 60 days, the bull market will continue along traditional four-year cycle lines with solid gains in October and November,” he added.  “If Trump wins, a rush of new buyers could take the bitcoin price over $100,000,” Terpin said, adding that the six months after the halving have had pullbacks — and this fifth bitcoin cycle is no exception. “October and November are historically strong months for bitcoin, especially in the year of the halving and the year after,” he said.

Dogecoin Price Gains Over 10% In the past few sessions, Dogecoin price saw a decent increase above $0.090 like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The price was able to clear the $0.0945 and $0.0950 resistance levels. It cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1145 swing high to the $0.0804 low.

32213414,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634135,1723179616,"Bitcoin’s Latest Casualty: Miner Reserves Plunge to 3-Year Low, What’s Next For BTC?","Amid Bitcoin (BTC) continuous struggle for a major rally to new heights, miners powering the Bitcoin network are experiencing significant economic shifts. Particularly, recent data shows a stark reduction in Bitcoin reserves held by miners, signaling potential shifts in market stance or miner strategies. Related Reading: $0 Flows: BlackRock Unshaken Despite Recent Bitcoin Market Crash, Data Shows Bitcoin Miner Reserves: A Plunge To 3-Year Low Following the latest Bitcoin Halving—an event that reduced the block rewards miners earn for their computational efforts—which occurred back in April, the total Bitcoin reserves held by miners have plunged to a three-year low. The data shown by Kaiko revealed that as of August 3, BTC miner reserves witnessed a notable plunge to roughly 1,510,300 BTC, marking a 2.4% decrease from the peak earlier in December 2020. This reduction translates to an estimated value of $86 billion, accounting for about 8% of all BTC currently in circulation. In its latest report citing Kiako, Bloomberg attributes this decline in the miner’s reserves to the increased sell-offs from the miners ahead of the recent halving. These sales have been primarily driven by the need to cover operational costs amidst reduced income from block rewards. The report read: The main source of revenue for crypto-mining companies such as CleanSpark Inc. and Riot Platforms Inc. was dramatically reduced by the halving. The preprogrammed update slashed rewards the firms get from validating blockchain data, which is referred to as mining. Although it is worth noting that the network fees on the Bitcoin network saw a spike immediately after the halving, providing temporary relief, this was short-lived as it was quick to adjust back to lower levels, with average fees now at $1.2 as of today, down significantly from more than $120 seen in April post-halving. There’s A Glitch Interestingly, despite the market-wide trend of reduced reserves or holdings from these miners, some public mining companies appear to be bucking this trend, with their Bitcoin reserves increasing significantly. Bloomberg, citing reports from the US Securities and Exchange Commission, noted: [P]ublic mining companies have actually increased their holdings of Bitcoin by 60% to 54,000 tokens since January 2023. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. recently reported that it bought $100 million worth of Bitcoin. This accumulation, considered strategic given the current market condition, may suggest a bullish outlook from certain mining industry sectors despite the broader sell-off. However, the financial health of these mining companies appears to be somehow varied. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Bitcoin Could Plunge Back To $51,000 On Wedge Pattern Breakdown According to Bloomberg, Core Scientific Inc. had already recently reported a substantial loss of about $804 million for Q2 of this year, which can be due to a “write-down” of the value of its Bitcoin holdings to reflect the current market prices.

42390638,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bd4d5D,1723179440,Coinbase Takes Aim at CFTC's Definition of 'Gaming' in Proposed Prediction Market Rules,"Coinbase responded to the CFTC's proposed rules regarding prediction markets, taking aim at how the CFTC proposes to define 'gaming'.  Coinbase would like the CFTC to regulate prediction markets on a contract-by-contract basis instead of using broad categories or definitions.  Proposed rules by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regarding prediction markets should be withdrawn because they exceed the commission's statutory authority and ignore the positive impact of prediction markets on the economy, Nasdaq-listed crypto exchange Coinbase wrote Thursday in a letter to Commissioners.  ""We firmly believe that this all-or-nothing approach to the treatment of event contracts is not consistent with the promotion of responsible innovation and growth in regulated, transparent markets with appropriate safeguards to protect market integrity and protect customers,"" Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, wrote in the letter.  In May, the CFTC published a proposal on event contracts (prediction markets) that defined ""gaming"" as betting on outcomes of political contests, awards, or athletic events. This proposal had the support of three Democratic commissioners, CoinDesk reported at the time, who cited concerns over market integrity and the agency's role.  In Thursday's letter, Coinbase wrote that it objects to the CFTC's broad definition of ""gaming,"" arguing that it unfairly restricts valuable event contracts by categorically banning them without considering their individual public interest merits.  ""If adopted, the rule would capture contracts as ""gaming"" that by any common understanding are not, in fact, gaming,"" Coinbase wrote, arguing that this is inconsistent with ""legislative history related to gaming, neither of which suggest that gaming should extend beyond sporting events"".  Coinbase gave one use case for prediction markets for sporting events: a vendor hedging the costs of printing t-shirts in anticipation of a team winning a championship by taking a position in favor of that team's loss.  The exchange complained in the letter that the Commission equates speculation with gaming but fails to distinguish between market speculation and actual gambling in its proposal.  ""Few would agree that elections or professional awards such as Nobel Prizes or Academy Awards are granted through a process that should generally qualify as games, yet these are the examples presented as constituting such a definition,"" Coinbase continued.  The proposal would also ban contracts on war, terrorism, and assassination.  Polymarket offers several contracts about geopolitical outcomes that would fit into this category, such as one that asks bettors if Iran will launch military action against Israel by next week in response to Israel's assassination of Hamas' leader in Tehran.  These may be useful for forecasting world events, and Coinbase argued that the CFTC is overlooking what it calls the significant benefits of prediction markets. Coinbase cites research showing that prediction markets can efficiently aggregate information and outperform traditional forecasting methods.  Instead, Coinbase proposes that the CFTC withdraw the broad, categorical ban on event contracts and continue evaluating them on a contract-by-contract basis, considering the public interest merit of each prediction market category.  ""We urge the CFTC to withdraw this proposal and work alongside academic, industry, and policy stakeholders to develop a more balanced approach that promotes innovation while protecting the public interest,"" Coinbase's Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal posted on X.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | RESEARCH,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/08/09/coinbase-takes-aim-at-cftcs-definition-of-gaming-in-proposed-prediction-market-rules,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0dc1e8b4cca5037925d0ee312f42162a65fcbb7-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The move comes even as ARB, the native token of the Ethereum layer-2, continues to post lower lows, pushing losses to nearly 80% since January 2024 highs. Arbitrum Orbit Chains Support USDC For Paying Gas Fees In a press release, the decision to integrate bridged USDC aims to reduce gas fees and attract more developers. As of August 8, USDC is one of the top stablecoins by market cap. CoinMarketCap data shows that Circle, the stablecoin issuer, has minted over $34.5 billion of the token, mainly on Ethereum and its layer-2s. Related Reading: 3 Reasons Why Ethereum Is Struggling Today: Will ETH Break $2,000? It should be noted that USDC is also supported in other ecosystems, including Solana and the BNB Chain. Currently, over $1.6 billion USDC has been bridged to Arbitrum. By allowing users to pay gas fees using USDC, Arbitrum said they would be saved from the pain of enduring volatility typical in ETH. Depending on demand, gas fees tend to fluctuate, rising by several folds when there is congestion in the mainnet. This volatility tends to impact user experience significantly. As such, some users opt for alternative platforms like Solana or Avalanche, where gas fees are relatively low. Since USDC is pegged to the greenback, it is stable. Accordingly, regardless of the decentralized app they use on Arbitrum’s orbit chains, users can predict gas fees, making it easier to budget and, more importantly, manage finances. Pushing Adoption, ARB Down 80% In 8 Months In the press release, Arbitrum added that this integration will free orbit chain users from holding multiple tokens, further enhancing user experience. Related Reading: More Pain Ahead: Analyst Warns Of Imminent Bitcoin Plunge Below $54,000 To Fill CME Gap Circle also announced a grant program for projects looking to be built on Arbitrum. This may spur the adoption of USDC on the orbit chain. Despite the integration, ARB, the native token of Arbitrum, remains under intense selling pressure. As of August 8, the downtrend remains, and ARB is down nearly 80% from January 2024 highs. Even though prices have been consolidating, as evident in the daily chart, bulls need to push higher, clearing $0.60. However, a clean break above 40.80, or July highs, could spark demand. This surge may revive demand in the medium to long term.

However, it's still overvalued based purely on NAV rate valuation. Private placements allow accredited investors to buy new shares at NAV and sell at a premium after lockup period. We've seen 26% YTD growth in LTCN shares outstanding. Litecoin's utility and active addresses show promise despite weakness in this cycle, with NVT ratio suggesting LTC is undervalued. It's been four months since I last covered the Grayscale Litecoin Trust ( LTCN ) for Seeking Alpha. This trust is a closed-end fund that exists primarily to offer traditional market investors direct exposure to the native asset of the Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) blockchain. I've made no bones about my affinity for Litecoin as a network. However, despite my bullishness on Litecoin overall, I've called LTCN a ""hold"" each of the two times I covered the fund. In early April, I concluded with the following: At a $46.85 share price, LTCN is implying a $438 Litecoin price. I'd love a $438 LTC price as much as the next Litecoin bull, but LTCN's premium simply has no fundamental justification. This fund traded at an even larger premium about 3 years ago. That doesn't mean we'll see those NAV rate levels return this time around. As it turns out, my last LTCN article was published the day of the highest close for the fund since 2021: LTCN Daily (TrendSpider) In the time since, we've seen the fund shares collapse by roughly 80%. This highlights the danger when playing the number go up game with crypto proxies via Grayscale. Silly NAV Rate Games, Silly NAV Rate Prizes As of 8/7/24 close, the premium rate on LTCN shares was just 97.5%. You can see in the chart below that, while still overvalued based on NAV, the premium rate has collapsed from 400% back in April. To put this into proper context; each share of LTCN represents 0.085 LTC. So for a crypto investor who wants to value LTCN based on the Litecoin exposure that each share actually holds, they have to multiply the LTC per share by the price of LTC. LTCN NAV Rate Trend (CoinGlass) In this case, we multiply 0.085 by a Litecoin price of $56.26, and we get a net asset value per share of $4.79. In essence, LTCN longs are willing to pay $9.46 for $4.79 in underlying value. And, again, this is actually an improvement over what bulls were doing just a few months ago. Grayscale Fund Comparison (CoinGlass) The good thing is, LTCN doesn't have much further to go before it gets to what I'd view as a more fair valuation. And beyond that, LTCN is by no means the worst example of speculative froth from Grayscale's single asset closed end funds. The Grayscale Filecoin Trust ( FILG ) still claims that honor at a premium to NAV of over 800%. Private Placements Over the years, we've seen the NAV rates for Grayscale's closed end fund products deviate dramatically in both directions. During 'crypto winter,' most of these products traded at deep discounts to net asset value - often as low as 50-60% of NAV. These proved to be wonderful opportunities for patient bulls to play the arbitrage game. One of the major reasons these NAV rates have been able to get so extreme in both directions is because they aren't ETFs. Thus, the assets underlying the fund can't be redeemed at NAV as they could through the ETF wrapper. However, there is a mechanism for combating extreme premiums. Earlier this year, Grayscale re-opened private placements for the funds that were trading at large premiums to net asset value. Through private placements, accredited investors can buy new shares in the fund at NAV and wait through a one year lockup period to sell those newly issued shares on the secondary market. Private placers are essentially hoping the premiums stay high through their lockup expiration so they can buy at NAV, sell at a premium, and pocket the spread. Grayscale Crypto Fund Ticker 8/7/24 Shares 12/31/23 Shares Change Litecoin LTCN 21,663,000 17,204,700 25.9% FileCoin ( FIL-USD ) FILG 1,618,700 111,400 1,353.1% ChainLink ( LINK-USD ) ( GLNK ) 987,310 321,010 207.6% Solana ( SOL-USD ) ( GSOL ) 1,296,427 633,627 104.6% Source: Grayscale, Author's calculations In the table above, I'm showing the year to date change in shares outstanding for four of Grayscale's single asset crypto funds. Litecoin's year to date share growth has been just 25.9%. That might seem high, but compared to the aforementioned FileCoin fund, it's minimal. We can even see the Solana and Chainlink fund shares outstanding have doubled and tripled year to date. In my view, this is largely because those funds have had, and still have, dramatically higher NAV rate premiums than LTCN over the last several months. Thus, the post-lockup spread potential from private placement has been much more attractive in each of those funds. Litecoin To borrow a phrase from fans of a different cryptocurrency, it's largely been ticktock, next block for Litecoin despite the premium re-rating in LTCN. As far as utility goes, Litecoin is the only PoW coin that is even close to Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) from a 30-day average active address standpoint: 30 Day avg active addresses (CoinMetrics) While clearly in decline since the launch of spot ETF products, Bitcoin's 30-day active address number still stands at 711k as of article submission. This is a bump over the lows from June, but still well behind where the network was at the end of last year. Litecoin's story here is a bit more encouraging, with 30 day active addresses at 367k. While off the highs, this is well ahead of where the Litecoin network was in November 2023 before transaction fees popped on Bitcoin. Which brings me to why I'm still bullish LTC despite its weakness in this cycle. When Bitcoin's fees pop and small transactions are no longer economical on the Bitcoin network, Litecoin usage picks up and we've even seen LTC active addresses eclipse BTC active addresses for brief periods. Existing Bitcoin Lightning nodes can still transfer value more cheaply when BTC fees spike, but opening and closing new channels during times of high fees makes Lightning less viable. Thus, Litecoin activity surges instead. 30 Day avg NVT Ratio (CoinMetrics) Comparing valuation is always tricky in crypto. Individual chains are often optimized for different actions. For the more payment-focused proof of work coins, I like to look at the NVT ratio. This is the market cap divided by the USD-denominated value transacted over the network. Here we see LTC at a 30 day average NVT ratio of 56. By comparison, BTC trades at 186 and other proof of work coins like Dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ) and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) trade at very similar multiples to BTC despite having less users. In my opinion, LTC is very cheap. Investor Takeaways Valuation is really subjective, and it's important to recognize that. As an advocate for public blockchain and the utility that these networks enable, I find the LTC vs LTCN scenario very interesting. On one hand, I think LTC is too cheap relative to peers. On the other hand, I think LTCN is too expensive relative to LTC. Despite what, I believe, are flaws in the product itself, LTCN is a fund that I've held long in the past and one that I certainly wouldn't rule out longing again in the future. That said, I don't want to pay double what the LTC is currently worth. I still think the better approach is owning LTC directly over holding LTCN shares. I'm still calling LTCN a ""hold"" today. If we see LTCN come back down to a NAV rate more inline with how the market is valuing LTC, I'll consider going long.",NEUTRAL,BCH | LTC,BCH | BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4712541-ltcn-ltcusd-grayscale-litecoin-trust-coming-back-down-to-earth?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/32211976.jpeg

32210755,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=634143,1723172442,"Analyst Mega Bullish On XRP, Foresees Potential ETF And Price Range Between $16-$20","In a significant legal victory for Ripple Labs, Judge Analisa Torres recently ruled in favor of the company in its prolonged legal battle against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ordering a payment of $125 million to the regulator. The ruling also clarified that XRP, the cryptocurrency at the center of the case, is not deemed a security, marking a pivotal moment for the token’s future outlook. Analyst Sees Bright Days Ahead Following this landmark decision, the sentiment surrounding XRP has turned increasingly bullish. Crypto analyst Doctor Profit, in a new analysis report published post-ruling, highlighted the long-term potential of XRP. Contrary to short-term trading strategies, Doctor Profit emphasized that XRP is designed for investors with a patient outlook, citing its historical price range of $0.42 to $0.72 over the past year. Acknowledging XRP’s past performance, Doctor Profit pointed out that in 2017, XRP surged by a remarkable 60,000%, showcasing its potential for explosive growth. Related Reading: CryptoQuant CEO Says Bitcoin Price Could Reach New ATH If It Holds This Level Despite facing setbacks such as a significant crash in 2020 due to the SEC lawsuit, XRP has consistently maintained a position in the top 10 cryptocurrency market cap rankings alongside Bitcoin for over a decade. Moreover, the analyst said the recent US court ruling confirming that XRP is not a security has provided much-needed regulatory clarity and optimism for the token’s future. Doctor Profit speculated on the possibility of a spot XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the works, aligning with past ETF approvals starting with Bitcoin, followed by Ethereum, and potentially XRP. Breakout Potential For XRP With the lawsuit pressure lifted, Doctor Profit expressed strong confidence in XRP’s bullish prospects, emphasizing the positive signals from both a regulatory and technical standpoint. The technical analysis highlighted a key resistance level at $0.72, with a potential breakout signaling a bullish scenario for XRP’s price trajectory. Currently trading at $0.6150, the token has gained 23% in the last 24 hours alone, outperforming most of the market. If the current uptrend holds, this key resistance level outlined by Doctor Profit could be breached, given the bullish catalyst and regulatory clarity the token has gained following the court ruling. Related Reading: More Pain Ahead: Analyst Warns Of Imminent Bitcoin Plunge Below $54,000 To Fill CME Gap If this and other higher levels are breached, Doctor Profit has outlined price targets for XRP, projecting a best-case scenario of $16 to $20 and a worst-case scenario of $4 to $7 within a one-year timeframe. Lastly, leveraging insights gained over four years of investing in XRP, Doctor Profit advised investors to focus on strategic buy zones and remain steadfast in their long-term commitment to the cryptocurrency.

XRP Wallets With 10 Million To 100 Million Tokens Have Set A New Record According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the XRP sharks and whales have sharply increased their holdings recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the total amount of the cryptocurrency that a given wallet group is holding right now. Addresses or investors are divided into these cohorts based on the number of coins that they are currently carrying in their balance. A wallet holding 5 XRP, for instance, falls into the 1 to 10 coins group. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Jumps 39% From Crash Low, But Is This Rally Sustainable? In the context of the current topic, the 10 million to 100 million tokens cohort is of interest. At the current exchange rate, this range converts to $6.13 million at the lower end and $61.30 million at the upper one. Clearly, the entities that would qualify for this group would be among the largest in the sector. More specifically, the higher end of the sharks and the lower end of the whales would fall inside this range. Generally, the influence of any entity on the network goes up the more coins that they hold, so the behavior of these large holders can be worth keeping an eye on, as it may end up affecting the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the XRP Supply Distribution for these sharks and whales over the past few months: As is visible in the above graph, the XRP sharks and whales have sharply increased their holdings during the past few days. Alongside the buying, the asset has seen a rebound from its crash, with a particularly large jump coming during the past 24 hours. This latest increase in the cryptocurrency’s price is a result of Ripple’s victory against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as the court has ruled that the firm only has to pay $125 million of the $2 billion fine that the SEC had sought. Interestingly, the bulk of the shark and whale accumulation had actually come ahead of the news, implying that big money investors may have had anticipated the outcome. The Supply Distribution for the 10 million to 100 million coins group is now at a new ATH, as investors belonging to the cohort combined carry around 7.06 billion XRP, worth around $4.3 billion right now. This reflects an increase of more than 10% in August alone. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for another indicator, the Social Dominance, which basically tells us about what percentage of social media discussions related to the top 100 cryptocurrencies that a given asset is currently occupying. Related Reading: Bitcoin Funding Rates Turn Negative: Shorts’ Turn To Get Squeezed?

The analyst projects that Bitcoin could rise as fast as it fell, mirroring the speed of its crash as it regains all the value shed during its decline. Bitcoin Set For Rapid Recovery In an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 6, a crypto analyst identified as ‘The Crypto Dog’ has shared an optimistic forecast on the future outlook of Bitcoin. The analyst believes that Bitcoin may recover quickly from its recent market declines, highlighting that the pioneer cryptocurrency would regain its lost ground at a pace as swift as its previous crash. Related Reading: Dogecoin Bounces Off Key Support Following Crash Below $0.1 The analyst’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin’s price comes after the cryptocurrency quickly rebounded from its former lows and maintained a crucial support level around the $54,000 price mark. Bitcoin’s resilience at maintaining a price above the $54,000 level could be a possible bullish signal, considering the cryptocurrency fell drastically below $50,000 in the previous weeks. In recent days, Bitcoin has shown remarkable strength after witnessing a crash that led to more than 20% of its value wiped. Despite the substantial price decline, the cryptocurrency appears to be on a major recovery trend, steadily approaching the $60,000 point once again. Earlier this year, Bitcoin rapidly rose to an all time high above $73,000, driven by the approval and launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Following this rally to a new ATH, Bitcoin underwent its cyclic halving event which at the time was considered a bullish event that could propel the price of the cryptocurrency even higher. Despite analysts’ bullish projections of Bitcoin during this bullish cycle, the cryptocurrency has faced major liquidations, driving its price down to new lows. Nonetheless, whales continue to buy Bitcoin at a rapid pace, taking advantage of the lower prices and accumulating over 30,000 BTC worth about $1.62 million. Analyst Says Now Is The Best Time To Buy BTC A crypto analyst, identified as ‘the on-chain college’ has highlighted the most opportune time to invest in Bitcoin.

Sharing a chart of Bitcoin’s price movements, the analyst mentions the Mayer Multiple, a unique metric that compares Bitcoin’s current price to its 200-day moving average. He disclosed that Bitcoin’s Mayer Multiple is currently at its lowest level since the bottom of the 2022 bear market.
