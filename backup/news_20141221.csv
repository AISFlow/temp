42398102,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA6F,1419182001,Review: Ledger Wallet Nano Provides Premium Security on a Budget,"The basics  Security  Using the device  Pros  Cons  Competitors  Conclusion  The basics  The Ledger Wallet Nano is a new hierarchical deterministic multisig hardware wallet for bitcoin users that aims to eliminate a number of attack vectors through the use of a second security layer. This tech-heavy description does not mean much to the average consumer, though, which is why I am going to explain it in plain language, describing what makes the Ledger Wallet Nano tick. The wallet launched in early December and for more background on the project you can catch up on our launch coverage.  In terms of hardware, the Ledger Wallet Nano is a compact USB device based on a smartcard. It is roughly the size of a small flash drive, measuring 39 x 13 x 4mm (1.53 x 0.51 x 0.16in) and weighing in at just 5.9g.  The box also contains a simple manual, recovery sheet and security card in black faux leather pouch.    USB flash drive on the right included for reference    I have no major complaints about the build quality, although some rough edges are visible upon closer examination. The plastic device features an aluminium swivel cover with a brushed finish like many USB drives. In fact, the design looks eerily similar to Super Talent's Pico-A series flash drives.  Ledger Wallet Nano security concept  Ledger's familiar design is where its similarities to traditional USB drives end, though. Since it does not use cheap NAND memory like the average USB drive, the Ledger should be more reliable. The manufacturer of the EEPROM memory used in the CC EAL5+ compliant smartcard offers a 30-year guarantee on data retention and 500,000 read/write cycles.  The smartcard has been an industry standard for decades and eliminates a number of security issues that may arise on devices based on multipurpose microcontrollers.  The wallet is obviously not designed as a standalone device, as it relies on the host computer to set up and execute transactions. Since the host computer is the most likely point of failure, the Ledger Wallet Nano is designed to render vulnerable or even compromised computers safe, by introducing another layer of security.  The wallet signs bitcoin transactions internally and aims to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by employing a security card. Without this added security layer, the wallet would be exposed to MITM attacks, as a hacker could, in theory, gain control of the computer and proceed to compromise the wallet. The security card makes such an attack less likely by providing physical two-factor authentication.  No transaction can be signed without human interaction – each transaction requires the user to visually scan the security card when prompted by the wallet app. The wallet displays the payment address and asks the user to enter codes for four random parts of the address. If the right code is not entered, a transaction cannot take place.  Security card in lieu of dedicated display  The Trezor hardware wallet, which we reviewed a few months ago, employs a screen to tackle this problem, prompting the user to enter the PIN on a pseudo-random numeric pad, visible only to the user. The Ledger team opted for a different approach in the form of a security card with 58 pairs of characters.  The basic idea is the same, but the implementation is a bit different. Using a card in place of a screen obviously allows for a smaller device and keeps the overall cost down.  The trade-off is that it also results in fewer possible permutations of the second-factor code. A persistent attacker with complete control over the user's PC could in theory reconstruct the security card after a few dozen transactions. Each transaction would provide the attacker with more 'depth' until sufficient information is collected to fully map and reconstruct the contents of the security card.  As odd as it may sound, using the wallet on a number of different malware-ridden PCs would, in theory, be safer from an anti-MITM perspective than using it to make a few dozen transactions on your own computer.  Ledger is aware of these limitations and is working to develop a mobile companion app that will essentially allow another device to act as a screen for the wallet. The app will be paired to the wallet using the security card, allowing the wallet to display the challenge on the mobile device, along with the target address and amount of BTC. The user will then be able to sign the security challenge and facilitate the transaction. The company plans to release the companion app in January 2015.  Using the device  The wallet is designed for use on desktop operating systems on Google's Chrome browser. I used an Asus Windows 8.1 tablet with a keyboard dock as the test bed.  Installing the Ledger Wallet Nano  The installation process is relatively straightforward, but requires the use of a Google Chrome app. The user merely needs to plug in the Ledger Wallet Nano into a USB port and head over to my.ledgerwallet.com to automatically install the Chrome application, which connects to Ledger's API server to access the blockchain.  While comparatively popular, Chrome is not the only browser on the market and millions of users still rely on Firefox, Safari and even Internet Explorer. A platform-agnostic approach would have been preferable, but for a number of reasons, including security certificates, it is simply not feasible. Linux users also need to create a set of udev rules to allow access to the device.  Once the app is ready, the user is prompted to enter the PIN. The user can choose the PIN or use one suggested by the installer. Then comes the recovery seed – when the wallet is initialised, it generates a 24-word mnemonic seed which must be stored, preferably on the included recovery sheet.    Don't try this at home - the seed should be written down and stored safely    The seed is displayed only once and must not be stored on your computer, in digital form. The seed is the only way of restoring the wallet in case of loss or hardware failure. This can be done using a replacement Ledger wallet, but the process also works on alternative BIP39 wallets like Electrum.  The Ledger Nano must be initialised on an uncompromised computer. One way of doing this is via air gap, using a live OS like Chromium on a USB stick, and the process should not take very long, although it does involve a bit of BIOS tinkering (i.e. changing the boot sequence).  In addition to the 24-word recovery phrase, the neatly arranged recovery sheet also includes the security card recovery QR code, which can be used to create a new copy of the second-factor security card in case of loss or theft. If you punch in the wrong PIN three times in a row, the wallet will reset itself to factory condition. This is also the easiest way of wiping the device in case you want to sell or gift it.  Using the wallet  Once the installation is complete, the user simply needs to insert the device into a USB port and enter the PIN in order to access the wallet.  However, all transactions must be validated using the security card. The wallet will issue a challenge and the user needs to follow instructions and enter the four-character code to validate the transaction. This is done by entering the corresponding characters from the security card.  The wallet itself is easy to use and anyone familiar with bitcoin wallets should feel at home. The only difference is the added layer of validation with the security card. Fortunately the whole process is simple and fast – usually taking no more than 15-20 seconds per transaction.  The wallet also features a QR scanner. Despite the fact that QR scanning has limited applications on desktop platforms, I used it to simulate topping up a mobile wallet and it worked fine. It could be quite a time saver in some situations.  Overall there is not much to say about the wallet – and this is a good thing – it's more or less a regular bitcoin wallet with an added layer of authentication, which doesn't take up a lot of time.  Pros  Very compact and sleek design. The Ledger can fit on any keychain, but don't forget the security card.  Value for money – at €29.90 the Ledger Wallet Nano is rather cheap as far as hardware wallets go.  The use of a smartcard in lieu of general purpose microcontroller should boost security and reliability in the long run  Validation via security card does not take a lot of effort or time  Cons  The device must be installed on a perfectly safe computer and not every user will be keen to use the 'air gap' approach.  The security card approach has its own pros and cons. While it helps keep the cost down and allows designers to create a truly pocketable device, it also provides slightly lower levels of security than a device with a dedicated screen. However, this issue could to some extent be addressed by the upcoming companion app.  Can't be used on mobile devices, support is currently limited to Chrome browser.  Alternatives  The Trezor wallet features a screen for an added level of immunity, but costs $119.  Conclusion  There is no such thing as absolute security, but the goal of hardware wallets is to make any potential attack more difficult and resource-intensive. Ledger is no exception – it is designed to render attacks impractical by raising the bar.  At €29.90, the Ledger Wallet Nano is good value for money, which means it will appeal to enthusiasts who want to hold bitcoin but don't want to spend too much money on security, and this is what makes it special in my book. It's not an expensive, specialised piece of hardware for the select few, it's geared toward the everyday bitcoin user.  The device can fit on a keychain and the security card in practically any physical wallet, which makes the Ledger very practical. If you lose either component, you can still recover your wallet using your mnemonic seed. The upcoming companion mobile app should boost security and bring Ledger on a par with more expensive solutions.  Update 31-03-2015: The Ledger Wallet Nano is now available from Overstock.

42398083,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbM9oX,1419178296,Bitcoin Crowdfunding is Catching on in China,"Bitcoin crowdfunding has taken off as a means to grow startups in China, with dozens of projects embracing the popular funding method to finance a variety of novel use cases.  One of those use cases currently being explored is selling part-ownership in a discussion forum to encourage quality over quantity in user behavior. Chinese forum Bikeji.com is offering its members the opportunity to become part-owners of the site through a crowdsale of shares in the company. In doing so, the forum's founder hopes to demonstrate the value of crowdfunding to the wider Chinese digital currency community.  Gang Wu, the founder of forum Bikeji.com, said selling valuable stakes in his online community has already made a dramatic improvement to the quality of conversation.  Explaining the thinking process behind creating Bikeji.com, Wu told CoinDesk he was fed up with the incumbent Chinese language bitcoin forums which, according to him, have too many advertisements, unsubstantiated rumors, and even outright slander.  There needs to be a space for more rational discussions, Wu said at his Zhongguancun, Beijing, office from which he also runs interest-bearing bitcoin wallet service Haobtc.com.  The result is his member-owned forum. Dedicated to cryptocurrency discussion, the forum has a Reddit-style reward point system and gives users the option to verify their ID – both measures intended to incentivize responsible posting.  Bitcoin crowdfunding in China  What is most remarkable about this forum, however, is its fundraising process.  On 16th November, Wu posted a proposal to raise 85 BTC in a WeChat group called 'Aisi Shuzi Huobi' (爱思数字货币 or 'love thinking digital currency'). Anyone who sent a bitcoin to a designated address would own 1/100 of the site, which had already already been online for two weeks by that point. Wu personally owns 15 shares and is responsible for the website’s day-to-day maintenance.  Within hours, the fundraising target was reached.  This is just one example of the newly emerging Chinese bitcoin crowdfunding scene. A quick scan on the Internet reveals about a dozen such projects over the past year – with most taking place in the mining sector.  One of the largest is Silverfish, a scrypt-coin mining operation. The project raised 5,600 BTC in late 2013. At that time, with the BTC price above $800, the valuation of the company was well beyond $10m.  The share value today, however, has dropped from its IPO price of 0.5 BTC per share to 0.07 BTC over the course of about a year. On 2nd December, the company announced that it would suspend dividend payments, citing capital strain as the cause.  Benefits and downsides  Wu concurred that ""high fatality"" was the norm for these ventures. He said he has personally invested in several bitcoin crowdfunded projects, including the aforementioned Silverfish. Most floundered. Some were outright scams, more were unprofitable due to bad timing, like Silverfish.  Since its launch, the litecoin price has dropped from $23.80 to $3.73 at press time, while hashing difficulty has grown substantially as scrypt mining transitioned from GPU rigs to ASICs like bitcoin.  When asked about the appeals and drawbacks of bitcoin crowdfunding, Wu said the positive is that bitcoin is a ""free currency"" allowing transactions directly between any two individuals – the verifiability of any transactions on the block chain to some extent removing the necessity of a third-party platform like Kickstarter.  The downside, Wu said, is lack of protection for investors:  ""Investment is a professional activity. Most people simply don't have the experience or knowledge to make an educated evaluation of the risk.""  In addition, bitcoin's unregulated nature is a double-edged sword. While it removes some legal hurdles, it also makes it difficult (if not impossible) for investors to seek legal redress when disputes arise – this also leads to a higher number of scams in the space.  Culture of risk taking  All of its problems notwithstanding, bitcoin crowdfunding in China is becoming its own vibrant subculture. Wu pointed out that a culture of risk taking is very strong among bitcoin investors there. Financial gain is not necessarily 100% of the motivation, he added: a sense of camaraderie in a small close-knit community is also a factor.  For Bikeji.com specifically, Wu believes that bitcoin crowdfunding has certain marketing value, especially by helping 'high-quality' users; the forum's crowdsale has attracted notable investors in the Chinese bitcoin space.  Wu expects that being a formal shareholder in Bikeji will give these BTC 'dignitaries' more incentive to post actively, thus attracting more users.  Fledgling business model  One month after its launch, Bikeji show all signs of being a robust forum. The number of registered users has exceeded 400, and new posts are frequently published.  Some of the project’s idiosyncrasies, however, may prevent it from becoming a replicable business model.  Its success has as much to do with Wu’s personal reputation, which, one may argue, is a bigger factor than the profitability prospect of the project itself.  Since Wu guaranteed investors full refunds if they opt to exit, the only downside risk is the possibility he will renege on that promise – but this risk, given the relative small investment amounts (and the fact that Wu is a well-recognized bitcoin entrepreneur) is likely low.  In addition, the project is a forum, meaning its success or lack thereof is relatively easy to ascertain. Regardless, Bikeji is just one example of the many types of use cases that startups in China and beyond could explore by tapping into the growing popularity of bitcoin crowdfunding.

42398098,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbMA3I,1419173276,"Stellar's Joyce Kim Talks the Launch, the Fork and the Future","Backed by mainstream payments technology startup Stripe, decentralized payment network Stellar provides a vision for how digital currency could solve real problems for people with restricted financial access.  It may be no wonder then that at San Francisco's Future of Money Summit in early December, the Stellar panel was among the most popular. The digital currency community is increasingly focused on the technology's use in payments, and Stellar aims to provide a decentralized payment system that improves on bitcoin and its closest competitor, Ripple.  However, since launching in July after months of secrecy, Stellar has arguably struggled to emphasize this message. Relatively silent in the media, the project has also waged high-profile battles against Ripple Labs, the company founded by its own creator Jed McCaleb, over both matters of technology and more corporate disputes.  In a new interview with CoinDesk, Stellar co-founder Joyce Kim provides a unique window into efforts at the Stellar Foundation, the non-profit dedicated to overseeing the development of the wider project, addressing issues regarding Stellar’s initial launch, perceived vulnerabilities and developer adoption.  Launch issues 'overblown'  Owing to the high-profile nature of its debut, Stellar was greeted with enthusiasm by the bitcoin community, but just how enthusiastic this response was has been subject to debate.  By September, Stellar already had 1 million Facebook authentications for users collecting free Stellar, a figure Kim suggests is indicative of the total users the project has garnered.  The comments hint at the controversy the project saw at launch, as users sought to game the system. Sites like Amazon Mechanical Turk and oDesk quickly became destinations for those who wanted to get more Stellar, paying others to register and collect the free funds.  Such actions were a clear violation of policies for both Stellar and the task sites, however, Kim downplayed this activity.  “You had to have a Facebook account, and there are certain checks to make sure that an account was not created before our launch. Also, more checks have been added,” she said. ""I would say that a lot of that was overblown.""  The whole event created a marketplace for Stellar that was clearly needed – making places like Mechanical Turk the first exchange for selling Stellar, although Kim cautioned that the Stellar that was traded might not have been properly valued.  “There were concerns about people giving up their Stellar for less than fair market value, because they did not know what Stellar was,"" she said.  Kim added that the Stellar launch was a learning experience for everyone involved – and noted that the foundation still has to give away a majority of the digital currency to users.  Tech solutions coming  Stellar is organized as a non-profit, and the Stellar Foundation is tasked with education and network security for the virtual currency, the latter of which has been an issue of late.  Recently there was an unintended ledger fork in Stellar’s consensus protocol, meaning that for a period of time, Stellar’s public ledger had split. The consensus had failed to agree, briefly creating two chains before developers got things back under control.  Stanford University professor David Mazières, Stellar's Chief Scientist, has attributed the problems to issues with the Ripple consensus protocol, the underlying network Stellar uses.  “We had [Mazières] look at the consensus algorithm to potentially do a white paper on it. And he said it was not provably correct, which is a big problem in computer science,"" Kim said.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ripple Labs’ CTO Stefan Thomas took issue with this interpretation, noting that the Ripple network has not experienced similar problems.  For the time being, Stellar will only run one validating node while a new consensus protocol for its system is revised. While in and of itself running only one node is not consensus, Kim said it is the best option while a totally new system for confirming transactions is devised.  “Professor Mazières is working on a new version. The white paper will be out with new code in a few months,” she said. “From there, we’ll have an entirely different consensus methodology based of off something new.”  Developer interest in Stellar  Having developers build third-party apps is important for platform adoption. For example, bitcoin is now seeing a growing number of startups working on business ideas built on top of its protocol. Stellar is no different; it must attract programmers in order to grow.  Kim said that developers on Stellar’s platform are different than those who work on bitcoin projects. “The people who build things on Stellar have not built things on bitcoin before,"" she contends, adding:  “Top three things I’ve found: they like that it is non-profit; they like the fact the distribution means there will be different kinds of users; they also like you can run real money on it.”  One month after the official launch, payments company Stripe held a Stellar hackathon, where about 120 people showed up to work on Stellar-related projects. Kim believes these efforts show promise, but that progress isn't easy in digital currency because of compliance concerns.  “I would say that the tough thing about the entire FinTech space is that it’s easy to put up small projects. It’s hard to launch a product that is regulatory compliant,” she said.  Even so, Stellar is seeing venture capital interest in projects based off the platform. Given her background, Kim is helping make those introductions.  “There are a number of Stellar entrepreneurs that are in the pipeline for funding. I have a lot of VCs asking me to introduce them to the best entrepreneur and most interesting ideas coming out of the ecosystem,"" she said.  Distribution and adoption  Kim noted that developers also like Stellar's plans for growth.  For instance, there’s still a lot of Stellar for the foundation to give out, and the team is looking for interesting ways digital currencies can be used in less developed countries.  “We’re trying to reimagine what a financial system that works for them would look like,” Kim said.  Stellar already has 20 employees, and is looking to hire more. Kim said that the foundation will fund itself through grants and with the 5% of total Stellar it was allocated. It wants to focus on access and maintaining the network, while letting others such as developers build businesses.  She noted:  “The foundation should focus on the robustness of the security of the protocol, educational programs and access. The partnerships should be left to the for-profit companies of the world.”  The US could be popular for use cases like outbound flows of remittances, an opportunity many entrepreneurs are looking into. Even so, the Stellar Foundation is visiting other countries trying to understand banking pain points.  “I think what’s so interesting with us is that we’re deep in the weeds. For example, we took our entire team to Nicaragua,” Kim said.  There, she said they found that people have a hard time accessing credit. There isn’t enough credit available for people to get loans, so they often have to pool borrowing resources together in unique ways to start a business.  The Stellar Foundation wants to figure out a way to fix issues as they gain interest in developing countries. Kim noted Vietnam as another country that is seeing traction with Stellar use.  She said:  “We have a lot of learning and research to do. In some ways we’re becoming anthropologists.”  Joyce Kim Photo at Future of Money Summit by Michael O'Donnell",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/12/21/stellars-joyce-kim-talks-the-launch-the-fork-and-the-future,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4851cbd9138c2d72c4712cbc4549fa66b132c342-1692x1124.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
