We saw LTC/USD run into the top of the ascending channel soon after it broke past the 61.8% Fib level but it did not decline sharply. Instead, the price started to rise again after a minor pullback and ran into the trend line resistance once again. The price is expected to do the same once more after a small retracement short term. This next rally would most likely result in a test of the 1.272% Fib level at the top of the ascending channel. That is expected to be the final move to the upside before the next major decline sets in. The halvening FOMO had a big impact on the price of Litecoin (LTC) and we saw the price rise aggressively when the mainstream media started talking about Litecoin (LTC)’s next halvening in August, 2019. We are still a long way from August but considering that Litecoin (LTC) is not a big enough cryptocurrency to be a bought on OTC markets, most of the buying and selling is done on exchanges and when some traders started to see the whales accumulating large amounts of Litecoin (LTC) they followed. This led to the herd following both the whales and the professional traders and the price of Litecoin (LTC) shot up until it topped out on most time frames. Please note that whenever the whales want something so bad, they want to create a negative experience. Chart for LTC/BTC (1W) The way this works is that you prop up the price of an asset prior to an expected development and then you crush its price well before that development (halvening). They have been doing it with stocks, commodities and a plethora of other financial assets for years. Let’s say a company had good earnings and Wall Street wants the stock really bad. So, they crush the price so the retail investor would feel bad about the price going down on positive news. We saw the same happen with Ripple (XRP) when the price kept declining sharply during its Swell Conference in 2017. A lot of people took this as a sign of weakness but the professionals knew what was going on so they bought the dips. In the weeks after, Ripple (XRP) rose to a new all-time high. Litecoin (LTC) is having a good run now but when the market starts to decline, a lot of people are going to give up and Litecoin (LTC) is most likely going to get crushed one of the hardest because it has already rallied so aggressively. This will once again result in a lot of people giving up on Litecoin (LTC) but the smart money as always will know when to buy for long term. Litecoin (LTC) is down more than 83% from its all-time high and we expect it to go down further. However, let us not forget that the price cannot just decline 100%. No matter where the bottom is, there is no doubt that it is very close. So, if anything this is the time to be accumulating, not selling.",NEUTRAL,LTC | XRP,BUSINESS | LTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/litecoin-unlikely-to-break-past-65-as-price-runs-into-trend-line-resistance,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284688.jpeg

16284687,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/sec-to-host-public-bitcoin-forum,1553031000,SEC To Host Public Bitcoin Forum,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have announced that they will be holding a public forum in May that focuses on Blockchain technology and Digital Assets such as Cryptocurrencies. The announcement sets a promising precedent that suggests finally, the SEC could be about to fully open their doors to cryptocurrencies, after a public consultation of course. The forum will be held on the 31st of May 2019 and has been set up by the SEC’s strategic hub for innovation, also known as FinHub, a department within the SEC dedicated to exploring Fintech and blockchain technologies. This is the second time the SEC will have hosted a public forum on crypto, meaning that this is surely something they are starting to get serious about. According to RTT News, the forum: “Will feature panelists from industry and academia, and is designed to foster greater communication and understanding around issues involving DLT and digital assets. The panelists in the discussion will explore topics including initial coin offerings, digital asset platforms, and DLT innovations. They will also talk about how these technologies impact investors and the markets.” The forum will be held in Washington at the SEC headquarters, with more to be announced in the coming weeks, including a list of speakers and other activities that will be taking place at the event. FinHub FinHub is a branch of the SEC that has been set up to explore innovation in technologies such as blockchain and finance. FinHub was established in October, though has since become an integral part of the SEC’s service. FinHub also seems to be responsible for much of the relationship building between the SEC, the public and those within the crypto industry that are responsible for institutional level cryptocurrency investment. In short, FinHub could be the department within the SEC that eventually accelerates cryptocurrency adoption, we can hope at least. The SEC are responsible for the future of cryptocurrency in the United States and are currently heavily involved in the current Bitcoin ETF saga. They are a very powerful entity and therefore it’s very exciting to see the SEC involving the public in forums and consultations in this way, it’s clear they want to see if the public are interested in crypto, with the view to establish more crypto regulations in the future, regulations that hopefully make Bitcoin adoption a real prospect.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/sec-to-host-public-bitcoin-forum,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284687.jpeg

Indeed, it’s common sense that an exchange with a high trading volume should be deemed popular, it simply means that there’s a lot of people using the exchange at a specific moment in time, though, trading volume can tell us and the exchanges themselves an awful lot more about what might be going on in the markets. This is why we should be concerned that according to some reports, 75% of Bitcoin Exchanges have reported suspicious trading volumes, with further research suggesting that as much as 86% of all cryptocurrency exchange reported trading volumes should be met with suspicion. According to CCN, a research site called TheTie have recently explored the matter further: “A site called TheTie released a report that estimates over 86% of all reported Bitcoin exchange volume is suspicious, while 75% of exchanges report extremely dubious volumes. The research uses a different formula than other reports have: it values each website’s visitors and compares that value to the reported figures.” TheTie offer a number of examples to backup this claim: “Bithumb, which has been the subject of previous investigations, was expected to have a monthly volume of roughly $1.2 billion based on an average visit value of $13,418. Instead, Bithumb reports over $28 billion. This means their reported volume is nearly 2,000% higher than what would be expected.” This is important, as fake volumes could mean that traders are being attracted to ‘high volume’ exchanges, unknowing that the reported volume is actually false. Investors look for exchanges with high volumes as with high volumes comes an element of trust. Moreover, the best prices tend to be found at the more popular exchanges. Now it seems that many investors may be choosing exchanges based on reported trading volume values that could indeed, be fake. TheTie offer quite a stark conclusion that highlights the problem here: “The weighted average trading volume per web visit for Binance, Coinbase Pro, Gemini, Poloniex, and Kraken was selected as a baseline volume per user to calculate expected volume. This amounted to $591 per web visit. BitMEX was not included because it is a futures exchange. This does not account for mobile app or API usage to trade – web traffic is an assumption for simplicity. Relative outlier detection is quite notable, so the outright number isn’t the main objective.” In short, there’s a lot of exchanges that could be affected by this.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TRADING | RESEARCH,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/huge-number-of-bitcoin-exchanges-report-suspicious-trading-volumes,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284686.jpeg

According to an updated IPO prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as of Dec. 31, the San Diego-based bank had 542 clients in the industry, including crypto exchanges, institutional investors in digital assets, and others. That's up from the 483 crypto clients as of Sept. 30 that Silvergate counted when it first filed to go public last year.  Among the new crypto clients signed in Q4 were two exchanges, 24 investors and 33 firms in a miscellaneous category that includes blockchain protocol developers, miners and service providers, according to the updated prospectus.  For the first time in an SEC filing, Silvergate identified some of these clients, a few of which were previously not publicly known to be bank customers: market maker Genesis Trading and investment funds Kenetic and Polychain Capital.  Earlier published reports have noted that the bank worked with bitcoin wallet provider Xapo, diversified crypto startups Paxos and Circle, and exchanges Gemini, bitFlyer, Kraken, Coinbase, Bitstamp and Bittrex.  Deposits decline  Despite the growth in crypto clientele, the amount of U.S. dollars these customers held in their Silvergate accounts declined by $123 million in the fourth quarter, from $1.593 billion on Sept. 30 to $1.470 billion on Dec. 30.  This shrinkage came entirely from the exchange category, where account balances declined by $174.4 million, to $618.5 million. while deposits from the other two groups grew. Crypto investors' deposits increased $4.8 million to $577.5 million and other startups' balances grew $46.4 million, to $273.9 million.

Further, the 37 cryptocurrency exchanges using Silvergate account for 34.7 percent of its total deposits.  For the full year, Silvergate noted, deposits from digital currency clients increased $150.4 million, or about 11.4 percent – even as the price of bitcoin crumbled from over $13,000 to less than $4,000 over the same period, suggesting that the bear market didn't impede this bank's growth in 2018 as a whole.

Organized by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Blockchain (APPG Blockchain), the Monday event featured live presentations from four firms working in the blockchain industry: IOTA, Oracle, Everledger and Lloyd’s of London. Among the audience were members of parliament, government officials and industry leaders, according to a statement from organizers.  The live demonstrations highlighted the potential of blockchain in real-life applications in supply chains for olive oil and diamonds (Oracle and Everledger, respectively), international trade (IOTA) and insurance claims and transactions settlement (Lloyd's).  Fernando Santiago, blockchain research and project manager at Big Innovation Centre, suggested the event could mark an important step for the U.K.’s blockchain industry, saying:  “This is a pivotal moment for UK, which could define our future leadership in governance, commerce and competition.”  In the run-up to the event, the group also published the Online Blockchain Showcase, featuring videos of 10 companies working in the space.  The 10 firms also took to the floor at the live showcase, undertaking a “One-Minute Challenge” proposing how government could drive the use of blockchain, including in the healthcare and education sectors, as well as finance and industry.  According to its organizers, the event was inspired by the positive results of a 2018 analysis of the U.K. blockchain industry, presented by APPG Blockchain on its website along with associated organizations.  APPG Blockchain was set up by cross-party members of parliament to help ensure that the U.K. plays a ""key role"" in the potential opportunities that blockchain can provide for the nation's economy, society, governance and provision of public services, according to its parliamentary web page.

16284685,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/why-ripple-is-the-best-hedge-against-bitcoin,1553013000,Why Ripple (XRP) Is The Best Hedge Against Bitcoin (BTC),"Ripple (XRP) is the best hedge against Bitcoin (BTC) at the moment and this is not the first time this has happened. We have seen Ripple (XRP) rise in the past when Bitcoin (BTC) and the rest of the cryptocurrency market have been on a decline. The reason this has been happening at times is because Ripple (XRP) is out of sync with the rest of the market at times. The exact same thing has happened once again. If we look at the weekly chart for XRP/BTC, we can see that the price is trading inside a major bullish pennant and the Stochastic RSI signals a trend reversal in the weeks ahead. Now, the reason Ripple (XRP) is the best hedge against Bitcoin (BTC) is because whether Bitcoin (BTC) rises or falls, you are better off holding Ripple (XRP) in the weeks ahead. People make a lot of fun of the “XRP Army” or “Ripple Fanboys” in this industry. In fact, there is a strong bias against Ripple (XRP) in this space which manifests itself at times in the form of hate speech and comments against XRP coming from even the most respected industry leaders. Even companies like Coinbase have been reluctant to recognize Ripple (XRP) for so long that they have only just listed the cryptocurrency recently despite there being a strong demand before the beginning of the last bull run. This explains why Ripple (XRP) trades out of sync with the rest of the market at times. A lot of people in this industry do not even recognize Ripple (XRP) is a cryptocurrency; they think it is a scam or some centralized coin with no real value or purpose. Much of this hate towards Ripple (XRP) has actually made the cryptocurrency quite undervalued recently. In fact, XRP/USD is trading just above $0.31. In addition to that, both the RSI and Stochastic RSI for XRP/USD have plenty of room for growth on the weekly time frame unlike most cryptocurrencies. All of this coupled with the fact that Ripple (XRP) is due for its biggest breakout in eight months confirms that something big is in the offing. We do not know yet what kind of fundamental news event will trigger this rally but we do know that there is a high probability we will see such a rally in the weeks ahead. One of the strongest attributes of Ripple (XRP) as a project and as a company is that it has conveyed a loud and clear message to the industry that it can do anything. Ripple (XRP) had notable public figures like Tim Berners Lee, Ben Bernanke, Bill Clinton and others as keynote speakers during its conferences which do lend a lot of credibility to this project. Moreover, they are in partnerships with big banks and financial institutions across the globe. Ripple (XRP) has made a successful integration with the Woocommerce platform and is now working on a way to send XRP by email. There is no doubt that this company is making big waves in the industry. Ripple (XRP) has delivered a working product and is already solving problems while others are still working on the technology. This goes on to show that Ripple (XRP) might have the best chance at adoption among all cryptocurrencies which is why it is the best hedge against Bitcoin (BTC) not only from an investment standpoint but also from an adoption one.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/why-ripple-is-the-best-hedge-against-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284685.jpeg

Then there are other fanatics that believe that Bitcoin is ‘digital cash’ which could be used as an everyday investment such as the weekly shop. Both sides of the argument believe that if their views were embraced by the rest of the world, the mass adoption of Bitcoin could finally occur and the price of Bitcoin will eventually be on its way back to its highs of $20,000. There seems to be a divide between these two sides and such a divide has led to some historical moments in the cryptocurrency space such as the creation of Bitcoin Cash and the “battle of egos” that resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV. Another key moment is the way the Bitcoin bubble seemed to keep on growing towards the end of 2017 and both sides of the track are seemingly behind this, to a certain extent. If we fast forward to today, the price of Bitcoin is less than favourable and the valuation of the cryptocurrency probably won’t be jumping anywhere, anytime soon. That being said, it doesn’t seem to be going anywhere either and continues to fight on with the occasional wonky moment. In 2017, there was a lot of hype for Bitcoin as it was gaining traction by mainstream media and newfound investors. Today, there isn’t a lot of hype, in fact, most of it has significantly died down. This leaves us wondering who is actually using the digital asset? Aside from the general community, who actually uses Bitcoin? According to a blog by Chainalysis, data shows that most of the entities who hold Bitcoin are investors, meaning that entities who’ve purchased Bitcoin for the purpose of holding onto it for the long-term. It does seem that more than six billion Bitcoin was held in accounts that didn’t have any activity in more than a year. Phillip Gradwell is an economist from Chainalysis who spoke to CoinDesk and said that when the aforementioned data was published that more of these investors are individuals instead of institutions. Compared to previous years, “there are [now] more people who are holding crypto personally… half of available bitcoin is still held by investors, but it has gotten somewhat less concentrated.” More into the Chainalysis data, just under five billion Bitcoin was held in personal wallets at the end of August last year. This figure showed a significant increase in the number of Bitcoin that is held by individuals rather than firms and long-term investors. At the end of 2017, Chainalysis found that around 4 billion Bitcoin was in the hands of individual investors. This sums up to around 26 percent of the overall circulating supply of BTC. The economist explained that the increased diversity in BItcoin wealth distribution is primarily down to the fact that long-term have sold off large chunks of their assets to fresher faces in the industry. A lot of these sales happened towards the end of 2017 during Bitcoin’s big bubble fiasco. Gradwell said that the higher amount of individual holders could mean that there are a greater number of entities that would be ready to use Bitcoin to make a purchase. This only works though if they are given the right opportunity to do so. “They are ready – if things were to change, [if] the opportunity to spend it were to arise – to actually spend it. We’ve kind of overcome the first hurdle of adoption, getting bitcoin into people’s hands.” So getting Bitcoin in people’s hands is all well and good but without the means to spend it on their day to day items, what’s the point? So what needs to happen before investors will be able to spend their BTC. The economist went on to explain that the development of solutions such as the Lightning Network could encourage holders to make purchases. The lack of user-friendly interfaces for Bitcoin purchases is also a big obstacle in the way for bitcoin as a way to make everyday purchases. The founder of the APAC marketing agency Tower Brands, Chris Williamson said: “Bitcoin had a cost and speed issue during the peak that will prevent it from becoming a practical payment network for consumer goods. For consumer mass adoption, a cryptocurrency would need to be widely accessible, accepted as a payment method by merchants; stable, and be superior in convenience to the current payment methods (cash or credit/debit card).”",NEUTRAL,없음,BCH | BUSINESS | FIAT | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/will-you-ever-buy-lunch-with-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284684.jpeg

42381726,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oTJb,1553009715,Bitcoin's Share of Total Crypto Market Slips Back Toward 50%,"Bitcoin’s dominance rate, or its share of the total cryptocurrency market, is on the verge of falling below 50 percent for the first time in over seven months.  At press time, the world’s largest cryptocurrency accounts for 50.9 percent of the total capitalization of the entire market and fell as low as 50.54 on March 17, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Before 2017, bitcoin’s dominance rate was perpetually in excess of 70 percent, but it began to deflate as new cryptocurrencies were created and sold to investors in initial coin offerings (ICOs), causing bitcoin’s dominance rate to drop to a low of 32.48 percent on Jan. 13, 2018.  Since, Aug. 11 of last year, however, bitcoin’s share of the cryptocurrency market has not fallen below 50 percent.  Bitcoin dominance rate  Having traded between $3,200 and $4,300 since Dec. 2018, bitcoin’s recent drop in market dominance can be attributed to a strong performance from the broader altcoin market, comprised of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin, rather than any significant depreciation to its own market.  In the past 90 days alone, names like enjin (ENJ), binance coin (BNB) and litecoin (LTC) have witnessed significant price increases of 406, 181 and 97 percent respectively, according to data from Messari.  As a result, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin has grown 33 percent since hitting a 2019 low of $51 billion on Feb. 6 to its current value of roughly $69 billion.  In the same time span, bitcoin’s market capitalization has also seen notable growth, but to a lesser extent than the altcoin market. Since Feb. 6, bitcoin's market cap has increased from $59 billion to its current value of $71 billion – a jump of 20 percent.  Bitcoin's shrinking dominance could be seen as a sign the crypto markets are shifting to a “risk-on” environment where investors prefer riskier assets, as altcoins are perceived to be. The rate falling below 50 percent would be a greater indication of this type of sentiment coming to fruition.  As it stands, the total capitalization of the broader cryptocurrency market records $140.6 billion, down 83 percent from its all-time high of $835 billion set on Jan. 7, 2018.

According to Dash News: “Dash has been growing rapidly throughout Venezuela due to their terrible economic policies and inflation. Dash has capitalized on the desires of Venezuelans for an alternative currency by having key outreach events to educate consumers and merchants on the benefits of Dash and how to get started. Additionally, they have hosted Dash Cities to connect Dash consumers and Dash merchants with each other and demonstrated the commerce power of Dash.” Take a look at the video to find out more about Rodrigo and Brian’s experience at the event and gain some wonderful insight into Rodrigo and his great work.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | TECHNOLOGY,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/brian-wilson-meets-rodrigo-ambrissi-at-anarchapulco-2019,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284683.jpeg

The 4H chart for BTC/USD shows that the price still has to rally towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level before a potential rejection. If the price does not stop there, we could see it rally all the way towards the 61.8% Fib level to rise above $5,000. The price is also trading in an ascending channel which is part of a major bear flag that will eventually result in BTC/USD falling towards another low in the weeks ahead. As BTC/USD closed last week above $4,000, we witnessed a sentiment shift as the bulls have once again started to step in to assume control. The bears on the other hand are scared as the number of margined shorts has topped out short term and a sharp decline in sell pressure is expected. Current outlook for BTC/USD suggests that this might be a bad time to enter short positions just yet no matter how tempting it may appear. However, previous trading history suggests that retail traders have made this mistake over and over again. There is no reason to believe that it will not happen again if these things have been happening since time immemorial. The majority starts to see that the price has topped out on major time frames so they rush in to open short positions. The whales then push the price just enough to hit their stops. When that happens, a massive short squeeze pushes the price of Bitcoin (BTC) higher giving bulls the false idea that bullish momentum has returned. Just when the bulls enter long position, the whales drag the price down to hit their stops which leads to further panic selling. The 4H chart for BTCUSDShorts shows how risky shorting BTC/USD at current levels could be. The number of margined shorts has run into trend line resistance and already faced a strong rejection. BTCUSDShorts has topped out on major time frames and there is no reason to think that the number of shorts will not decline sharply in the days ahead. When that happens, the steady decline in sell pressure is going to propel the price of Bitcoin (BTC) north of $4,000. We will most likely see some big news act as a catalyst for that rise. At this time, we have abundance of such news and developments. Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading sideways for a long time which led most bears to believe that we might see a strong decline after the consolidation but that has not happened. Instead, we have seen the price close above $4,000 on the weekly time frame. Now, the dilemma facing Bitcoin (BTC) bears is that they have already opened big short positions and are waiting for the price to drop, but if the price shoots up towards the 38.2% Fib retracement level instead of falling as we expect it to, things could get pretty ugly for the bears and we might see a lot of positions get liquidated which could potentially push Bitcoin (BTC) towards $5,000 in the near future.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | TRADING,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/bitcoin-poised-for-a-big-rally-past-4000-as-bulls-regain-control,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284682.jpeg

Perhaps Patrick Bateman checks his digital wallet every morning after doing 1,000 crunches, or maybe Jason Statham’s Terry Leather character is now drilling into safety deposit boxes looking for crypto enthusiasts’ 24 seed words. It’s a damn good thing US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin occupies his present position in a building adjacent to Donald Trump’s White House. In a not-so-distant past, Mnuchin founded Dune Entertainment which financed the X-Men franchise and Avatar. He also served as Executive Producer of The Lego Movie, American Sniper, Entourage, and Wonder Woman, among many notable others. Had he not taken the road less taken, Mnuchin could be the one producing Crypto, rather than advocating cryptocurrency regulations at the Group of Twenty. The irony is almost too thick to contemplate and appreciate. While we’re on the subject of the glowing New Yorker who inhabits the building next to Mnuchin’s office, is it my imagination or does the 2-minute, 17-seconds trailer for Crypto resemble certain aspects of the slow motion train crash-of-a-movie at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that the entire world is tuned into every day? Let’s start with the obvious and see what we can easily glean from this trailer. In the opening scene of the trailer, Kurt Russell – looking like a withered scarecrow – solicits help in a farm field from a sharply-dressed mystery man with a lipworm who seconds later appears to be sitting behind a monitor and evaluating an ICO called Delta Coin. Incidentally, a quick review of Etherscan suggests there actually is a token called Delta Coin with a total supply of 5,000,000,000 DTC that is held by a mere six addresses. With the most recent transaction some 176 days ago, we may have to wait for the full movie to learn if the token was created for the movie. Alas, I digress. We soon learn that the Wall Street wunderkind was at the top of his class at – ahem – Wharton, before engaging in crypto due diligence and that Mr Lipworm prevented his firm from transacting business with a large counterparty, leading to pre-release speculation that Mr Lipworm might be infiltrating financial institutions as an undercover investigator. Moments later, our protagonist gets reassigned to a role in Albany, New York, that oft-forgotten, upstate New York micropolitan-of-a-state-capital where BitLicense was created by the New York State Department of Financial Services, much to the recent satisfaction of Robinhood Crypto and Libertyx. Donald Trump’s ongoing feud with policymakers in Albany and prosecutors in the Southern District of New York is not lost upon those of us on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean either. We soon learn that Mr Lipworm is indeed an Anti-Money Laundering Officer and after bro-hugging it out with a childhood friend, Mr Lipworm is next browsing a digital wallet where he encounters USD 10,463,502 million(!!!) in cryptocurrency. Assuming principal photography for Crypto took place in 2018, many of us might consider USD 10 million to be a slow week of ICO deal-making, practically a blip on the radar that even the flimsiest of unicorns-to-be or tenbaggers could relegate to “Chump Change” in the Use of Proceeds sections of their white papers. My, how times have changed! Mr Lipworm next apprises his AMLO apprentice that there is – gasp – no KYC or AML associated with the digital wallet they are scrutinising. A few bad Brooklyn accents later (is there such as thing as a good Brooklyn accent?), our hero is video conferencing with the Office of Foreign Assets Control and informing them of a “serious problem” involving money laundering by the Russian mafia. While we don’t see the action in the short clip, it is quite possible that the agent on the other end of the video conference marched right into Mnuchin’s Treasury office and informed our resident movie buff-cum-Treasury Secretary that Russia was evading US sanctions – in Albany, New York of all places. Crypto’s trailer doesn’t reveal whether the laundered money was to be used to purchase a penthouse in Trump’s scuttled Trump Tower Moscow project. In life-imitating-art creative liberty, many readers and viewers may be hoping that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation might arrive at that exact conclusion. Again, I digress. A couple of hayseeds soon find a napkin with a threatening note about an upcoming meeting and are forewarned that “COPS = RIP.” We can only guess that the good law enforcement agents of New York State are not loading up on XRP (Ripple) in their public pensions. Some sort of kidnapping – it’s a bit unclear if Kurt Russell himself is being used as cryptobait – soon transpires and we next see a couple of gangsters working their magic on someone’s neck with a stun gun. Whilst we do not hear their accents in the trailer, the credits to the movie list an Olga N. Bogdanova as a Russian dialect coach, so one can only assume that Mr Goldie Hawn was jacked from his upstate farm and shanghaied to Grozny or Siberia – or maybe that was Poughkeepsie. A few opaque plot twists later do little to reveal the denouement, so we can wrap this trailer analysis without a spoiler alert. Back when Donald Trump was just getting started in giving New York City’s skyline a facelift, Gordon Gekko taught us that “Greed is Good.” A bit underwhelming by comparison Crypto’s tagline is that “Fear is the Ultimate Currency.” The motion picture’s rating forewarns us that there are violence, sexuality, and drug use. Naturally there is! How else could a cryptocurrency trader make it through a 7-day trading week without some fisticuffs, a gratuitous orgy or three, and some booger sugar? While we likely won’t see cameos by Don Jr, Ivanka, or Kushner, Trumpgate may not be too far from moviegoers’ minds at times. Maybe Mr Lipworm is the OFAC stable pony who manages to find collusion with the Russians after all. Let’s just hope Goldie remembers where Kurt keeps his seed words.",POSITIVE,ICO,BTC | ICO | MARKET | REGULATION | TOKEN SALE,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/why-i-blockgasmed-after-coming-across-the-crypto-movie-trailer,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284681.jpeg

The news was jointly announced by IBM and Stellar during a keynote at the Singapore event Money 2020 according to reports. IBM’s cross-border payment network, Blockchain World Wire was launched in collaboration with Stellar in September last year. Blockchain World Wire went live yesterday (18th March) and apparently more than 40 banks are on service which should leverage cryptocurrencies to enable near real-time international settlements between banks. According to reports, six banks have confirmed their intent to issue stablecoins backed by their national fiat currencies on BWW which included Banco Bradesco from Brazil, South Korea’s Bank Busan and the Phillippines Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation. Jesse Lund, the head of blockchain solutions at IBM has revealed that other banks, which has yet to be disclosed, will reportedly issue stablecoins that are going to be tied to the euro and Indonesian rupiah. Ahead of the announcement, IBM has also made a new partnership with the Stellar based, Stronghold in order to create the Stellar network’s very first stablecoin. The blockchain solution head has stated that IBM plans to expand its blockchain-powered settlement network with further assets saying: ""We let the market drive the expansion and selection of the network incrementally. We are really feeling excited that we are on a roll to build something new and revolutionary that's really going to change the landscape of cross-border payments."" BWW currently supports almost 50 currencies in more than 70 countries around the world.it disintermediates legacy bank settlement systems by bringing in the XLM token as an effective tracked settlement tool for fiat currencies between institutional parties. IBM doesn’t issue the settlement asset chosen between parties as Lund sat down in an interview to make it clear that “our view for stablecoins is really that they should be more broadly accessible and what World Wire seeks to do is to provide fungibility of digital assets across financial institutions.” In terms of price, Stellar is performing quite well on the day. The cryptocurrency is priced at $0.11 following a 5.15 percent increase over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XLM,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | ICO | XLM,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/banks-sign-up-introduce-stablecoins-ibm-network,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284680.jpeg

For those that don’t know, Digitec-Galaxus is often seen as the Amazon of Switzerland and is one of the biggest online retailers in the nation. The firm was founded in 2001 and operates the Digitec and Galaxus online shops as well as ten stores in other parts of Switzerland. Swiss customers of Digitec and Galaxus will now be able to pay with Bitcoin when shopping online. As well as Bitcoin, other altcoins will be accepted on the online retailer such as Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Binance Coin, TRON, Litecoin, NEO and OmiseGo. The Chief Innovation Officer and co-founder at Digitec, Oliver Herren has spoken on the matter saying, “Cryptocurrencies are fascinating and could become a relevant means of payment in e-commerce. We would like to support this development. We wanted to do that for a long time, but the effort was too long for a long time.” Herren was asked why his firm is getting involved in the crypto space and using digital currency as an alternative form of payment. He explained that “because you have some and you want to use them. Or because you cannot turn them into real money because your bank does not accept it. Or maybe just because your can and like to try new things.” The company has admitted that it is mainly doing this in order to get some praise from there younger audience and the tech-savvy crowd. Simultaneously, the volatility of price won’t be a problem as the firm states. All transactions will be processed through a third party payment processor Coinify and immediately converted to Swiss francs. Nevertheless, the new payment option will only be available for Swiss customers in its initial stages but if the new plan turns out to be successful then German customers will be able to jump on the bandwagon. This is a brave step by the leader of the online retail market in the country. It is likely that rivals of the Digitec-Galaxus will start doing the same thing and bring in crypto payments as an option to the users. It seems that Switzerland has been a hot place when it comes to crypto adoption.

Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Tuesday, BitGo said clients can now compliantly store their BCAP assets using the regulated firm's custody services, as well as in a new multi-signature wallet for the ethereum ERC-20-based token.  Speaking as to why the VC firm had opted to partner with BitGo for custody, Brad Stephens, co-founder and managing partner of Blockchain Capital, said: ""We wanted to ensure that our custody solution for BCAP would be completely secure while easy to manage.""  Blockchain Capital launched BCAP in April 2017, with each token representing shares in the Blockchain Capital III Digital Liquid Venture Fund. Effectively, it offers holders exposure to the underlying assets of Blockchain Capital, which invests in early stage companies in the digital assets space.  BCAP is tradable on secondary trading platforms allowing investors to ""benefit from the opportunity for liquidity in those assets,” according to BitGo. Back in January, regulated alternative trading system (ATS) SharesPost facilitated a secondary trade of BCAP tokens in a milestone proof-of-concept transaction.  BCAP has also been trading on U.S.-based regulated trading platform OpenFinance for several months.  “Security tokens are an increasingly important asset class for institutional investors,” said BitGo chief technology officer Ben Chan.  BitGo supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and tokens, and says it has over $2 billion in assets held in its wallets.

The native token to Ripple has achieved another landmark in its journey to mainstream adoption. The cryptocurrency is now fully integrated with the Woocommerce online market giant. The asset gained this through a bounty program by the founder of XRPL Labs, Wietse Wind. Last week, the announcement came that Wind was offering more than $900 in XRP as a prize to anyone who could implement the token to Woocommerce which powers more than three million online stores across the globe. Today, the challenge seems to have been completed as XRP is potentially witnessing adoption by more than 3 million users overnight. Although it is currently unknown as to who actually integration the crypto with the platform, this is great for adoption. Wind’s XRPL Labs is making some big contributions in the promotion of cryptocurrency especially when it comes to Ripple’s native token. Aside from the integration that Winds has just achieved, XRPL Labs is also going to be working on launching a decentralised exchange in a similar light to that of Binance. XRP has been contributing to supporting projects executed by Winds that mostly revolve around the digital asset. The XRP Tip Bot is now a popular bot for sending tips on social media. In fact, Ripple has gained a lot of traction in making the most developments in the space recently. The cryptocurrency was recently added onto the Coinbase Pro platform and despite the backlash, XRP is still rocking on, on Coinbase. Back to Woocommerce. The integration of XRP on the online store is probably going to go down as one of the biggest achievements that XRP has made in recent years. Millions of users are going to see XRP and, fingers crossed, they start to use it which will lead to adoption. When it comes to price the market seems to be doing well at the moment. Bitcoin has finally breached the $4,000 key resistance level and XRP is currently priced at $0.31 after experiencing a 0.49 percent increase over the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,XRP,EXCHANGE | ICO | MARKET | XRP | BNB,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/xrps-integration-woocommerce-could-reach-customers,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284678.jpeg

Starting on the Ethereum blockchain several years ago, TRON launched its own mainnet in June 2018 which was celebrated as ‘independence day’ for the decentralised project and has since been operating independently on its own. The CEO and founder of TRON are the famous Justin Sun and since the project gained its independence with Ethereum now being their main rival. This is put down to the TRON platform being very similar to the Ethereum platform, not to mention that the TRX token was based on Ethereum’s ERC20 token which is what most crypto tokens were built upon. The main goal for Sun is to beat Ethereum when it comes to smart contracts and dApp deployment, the two major things that the two projects have in common. Following the launch of the independent mainnet, the TRON Virtual Machine was released again in a similar sense to the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This was another significant achievement for the project which led to the commencement of dApp and smart contract deployment on the blockchain. In addition to this, Sun also bought out BitTorrent in his effort to decentralise the internet. Following this, TRON gained a lot of traction in the community and became quite famous to an extent. TRON saw a lot more users flood onto the platform and sometimes increased by 100 percent in months which garnered a lot of attention for the project. At the time of writing, TRON brags that they have more than 2 million accounts in its network and recently announced that the project has surpassed $100 million in 24 hours dApp volume. There has been a lot of success for TRON so far and we can only expect that throughout 2019 we are going to see a lot more of it. The fact that a startup could grow at such a speed is nothing short of phenomenal. The quick growth of TRON has raised some suspicion though which is down to Sun not being able to put a lot of technological effort into the platform but instead his selling point is the active publicity he engages is on social media. At the start of the year, an inside source from the SEC indicated that the project was on a path to destruction and warned the community to stay well away from it. The SEC hasn’t actually taken any action towards TRON so maybe this inside source wasn’t really legit.",POSITIVE,TRX,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | ICO | REGULATION | TRX,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/trons-past-indicates-the-right-way-greater-success,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284677.jpeg

42381724,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oTIL,1552993215,Bitcoin Faces Minor Price Retreat Amid Increasing Bull Exhaustion,"View  Bitcoin created a doji candle yesterday, signaling buyer exhaustion near the crucial 21-week moving average (MA) resistance at $4,073. As a result, a price pullback could be in the offing in the next 24 hours.  A break below $3,930 (flag support on 4-hour chart) would further strengthen the case for a pullback and expose support levels lined up at $3,890 and $3,755.  The doji candle would be invalidated if prices find acceptance above $4,000 in the next few hours, confirming a bull flag breakout on the 4-hour chart. That could yield a rally to the bearish lower high of $4,236 created on Dec. 24.  Any gains above the 21-week simple moving average of $4,073 will likely be transient, though, as long as that average is sloping downwards.  Bitcoin (BTC) is showing signs of buyer exhaustion and could see a minor pullback unless resistance at $4,000 is scaled in the next few hours.  The crypto market leader witnessed two-way business yesterday before closing (UTC) on a flat note at $3,969 on Bitstamp. Essentially, BTC created a doji candle, which is widely considered a sign of indecision in the marketplace.  Notably, the fact that the doji candle has appeared close to the historically strong resistance of the 21-week simple moving average (SMA), currently at $4,073, suggests the indecision is predominantly among the bulls and could be considered a sign of buyer exhaustion.  So, a price pullback could be on the way, especially if support at $3,930 is breached in the next few hours. That said, the rally from the March 14 low of $3,775 could resume if prices rise above the resistance at $4,000, invalidating the doji candle.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,975, representing a 0.4 percent gain on a 24-hour basis.  Daily and weekly charts  On the daily chart, BTC looks to be creating the right shoulder of an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern, having bounced up from the rising trendline last week. The 5- and 10-day MAs are also trending north, indicating a bullish setup.  Even so, the rally has stalled near $4,000 and a doji candle has appeared, validating the bearish view put forward by the descending 21-week SMA, currently at $4,073.  BTC, therefore, risks falling back to the rising trendline support at $3,890. A break lower would expose the March 14 low of $3,775.  It's worth noting that bitcoin may have a tough time scaling or holding onto gains above the 21-week SMA as long as that average is trending south.  4-hour chart  As can be seen, BTC has created a minor bull flag – a continuation pattern that usually accelerates the preceding bullish move.  A break above the upper edge of the flag, currently at $4,000, would open the doors to $4,305 (target as per the measured move method)  However, the bullish exhaustion signaled by the doji candle would gain credence if prices fall below the flag support at $3,930. In that case, BTC will likely revisit key support levels at $3,890 and $3,755.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

According to a new article posted by Emirates News Agency, it seems as though the fintech conference was full of blockchain and banking related topics which would be enough to satisfy any enthusiast of this booming industry. Also at the conference was a discussion on regulations, big data, machine learning, compliance, regulations and financial surveillance to make everyone feel like they got their money’s worth at the event. One of the topics that stood out was “how financial regulators and banks can collaborate to develop processes and procedures to address regulatory risks in serving market participants operating crypto assets businesses” despite the whole idea of Bitcoin to fight back against the need for collaborations from regulators and banks. The participants of the event were all well aware of this but the article suggests claims that “fast-evolving market dynamics mean that banks, financial institutions as well as financial regulators have an important part to play to diligently monitor and keep abreast of such developments, and ensure financial services continue to operate in a robust and trusted way in an increasingly digital environment.” Essentially, legacy financial organisations don’t want to be sat twiddling their thumbs in the corner being rendered useless. The Chairman of UAE Banks Federation, Abdul Aziz Al-Ghurair has stated “given the rapid emergence of new FinTech such as cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets, it is essential that we develop frameworks and regulations that govern these technologies and developments.” Following on from this he said: “With aspirations to become one of the foremost international hubs for finance, we must keep up with the rapid technological changes taking place across the sector. Ensuring a robust monetary and financial market environment is critical to this, and can only be achieved by protecting consumer rights and safeguarding market integrity.” The CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority of ADGM Richard Teng has given his thoughts too saying “this event highlighted the importance and power of collaboration between regulatory authorities and financial institutions” he continues saying that this builds “the trust and commitment needed to introduce FinTech activities securely into the financial services sector.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET,,0,0,Crypto Daily,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/8/uae-banks-federation-aware-of-btc-power,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/16284676.jpeg

42381715,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oT71,1552989614,Japan to Tighten Rules on Cryptocurrency Margin Trading,"Japan is putting in place new, stricter rules for cryptocurrency margin trading from next year.  According to a report from Nikkei Asian Review on Tuesday, the Japanese Cabinet, the executive agency of the country’s government, has approved draft amendments related to financial instruments and payment services laws that include two notable changes related to cryptocurrencies.  Firstly, there will be a cap on cryptocurrency margin trading in line with the forex trading, at two-to-four times the initial deposit. Margin trading means using borrowed funds from a broker or exchange to trade an asset.  Secondly, all cryptocurrency exchanges in the country that offer margin trading will be mandated to register with the government within 18 months of the date the rules come into effect – some time in April 2020, according to the report. Non-compliant platforms will face closure.  The new registration scheme will exist over and above the existing licensing requirements, in which cryptocurrency exchanges are mandated to obtain a license as per the payment services law which went into effect in April 2017.  According to the report, speculation has outstripped cryptocurrency's use as a payment method. Citing figures from self-regulatory group, the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, it said crypto margin trading in Japan rose to about 8.42 trillion yen ($75.6 billion) in December 2018 – a figure around 11 times higher than crypto/cash conversions (777.4 billion yen or $6.9 billion).  The registration scheme would also separate cryptocurrency exchanges that provide margin trading and those who issue tokens through initial coin offerings (ICOs), in order to protect investors from Ponzi schemes, Nikkei indicated.  Back in January, the nation's Financial Services Agency said it was looking to bring unregistered investment firms that solicit funds in cryptocurrencies rather than cash under the country’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.

Announcing the news on Friday, Bison Trails said the round was led by Accomplice and Initialized Capital, with Notation Capital, Homebrew, Distributed Global and Charge Ventures and other angel investors also taking part.  The New York-based firm did not provide specific details on how it plans to utilize the funding, other than “to underscore our mission.”  Founded last year, Bison Trails aims to enable a future where blockchain participation is “easy, more transparent, and truly decentralized.”  The firm allows clients to launch ""highly-available, and geographically distributed"" nodes on blockchain networks, and offers infrastructure solutions, including staking, validating, voting, transacting and securing blockchain protocols.    ""The infrastructure that we’re building today will pave the way for an entire generation of new decentralized companies, services, and participants to access blockchain economies and networks,"" Bison claims. Its platform will launch in ""coming weeks"" to early partners.    Staking – supporting a network by holding its tokens and running a node for rewards – is a use case that has been drawing attention from investors in recent months.  Back in January, blockchain staking-as-a-service startup Staked raised $4.5 million in a seed round led by blockchain investment firm Pantera Capital.

42381723,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9oTH5,1552975224,Bitmain's Latest Zcash Miner Claimed to Have Tripled Hashing Power,"Cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain has launched a new miner for the privacy-oriented cryptocurrency zcash, which it claims, has three times more hashing power than its predecessor.  Announcing the news on Tuesday, Bitmain says the new ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit), called the Antminer Z11, is designed to mine cryptocurrencies that are based on the Equihash algorithm, such as zcash.  The company adds the new product offers a hashing power of 135K sol/s (solutions per second), which is “three times more powerful” than its previous Equihash miner, the Antminer Z9, which was released in last May. Sol/s is generally equivalent to h/s (hashes per second), which is the number of hash computations created per second in cryptocurrency mining.  Bitmain further claims that the Antminer Z11, adopting a 12-nanometer chip, is more energy-efficient due to the new internal circuit structure, which can save 60 percent of electricity cost compared to that of the Z9.  Bitmain first launched the Antminer Z9 at a time when the zcash community was having an ongoing debate on whether the network should be altered to become ASIC-resistant, meaning the network would prevent the participation of miners using ASICs, which are in general more powerful than ordinary Graphic Processing Units.  However, in June last year, members of the zcash community at the Zcon0 conference voted not to prioritize research efforts on changing the zcash network's rules in order to make it ASIC-resistant.  Just last month, Bitmain also launched a new 7-nanometer mining processor, called the BM1397, which is designed for proof-of-work cryptocurrencies based on the SHA256 algorithm, such as bitcoin and bitcoin cash.

Garzik shared the subpoena document on Friday, which shows that the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida has asked him to provide all documents that support his “personal theory” that the late Dave Kleiman is Satoshi Nakamoto. (Garzik claimed that Kleiman is Satoshi Nakamoto back in November in an interview with Bloomberg.)  ""My personal theory is that it’s Floridian Dave Kleiman. It matches his coding style, this gentleman was self-taught. And the bitcoin coder was someone who was very, very smart, but not a classically trained software engineer,” he said at the time.  Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator, passed away in 2013 following a battle with MRSA. Last year, his brother Ira Kleiman sued Wright, alleging that he misappropriated billions of dollars’-worth of bitcoin from the estate of Dave Kleiman, his former business partner.  The suit accuses Wright of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property [IP] associated with the bitcoin technology,” and is seeking return of a good portion of the 1.1 million bitcoins (worth roughly $4.3 billion as of press time) mined by the two, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for IP infringement.  Last April, Wright filed a motion to dismiss the case against him. However, back in December, the court denied most counts of Wright’s motion.  As per Friday's subpoena document, Garzik has also been ordered to provide all direct and third-party communications and documents related to both Wright and Kleiman, as well as those related to Silk Road and Mt. Gox among a total of 28 requests.  Garzik now has 30 days to provide all the information to the court, according to the document.
