34059672,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645035,1727478006,Shiba Inu Breakout Eyes $0.00002631 Level After Rallying Over 19%,"Shiba Inu is experiencing a notable price breakout, surging over 19% and positioning itself toward the critical resistance level of $0.00002631. This significant rally indicates a shift in market momentum, characterized by robust buying pressure and increased trading volume. Technical indicators suggest that SHIB is establishing a bullish trend, with key support levels solidifying its upward trajectory. As Shiba Inu approaches this pivotal resistance zone, we will navigate its recent 19% breakout and its approach toward the critical resistance level of $0.00002631. By examining the underlying technical indicators, market sentiment, and key support levels, we will assess the strength of SHIB’s upward trajectory and explore whether this rally can sustain its upward trajectory in the face of market resistance. Bullish Momentum Builds As Shiba Inu Targets Key Resistance On the 4-hour chart, Shiba Inu trades above the SMA, showcasing strong bullish momentum as it approaches the $0.00002045 resistance level. Solid buying pressure combined with the formation of bullish candlesticks indicates a robust upward trajectory, making a test of this level highly likely. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates the potential for continued upward movement, with the RSI surpassing the 90% threshold and showing no signs of a near-term decline. This suggests that recent resilience is gaining strength and the positive trend may persist. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Jumps Nearly 6% In Latest Price Rebound, Rally Incoming? Also, SHIB has successfully crossed above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the daily chart, indicating a significant shift in its price momentum. Holding its position above this indicator demonstrates the asset’s resilience and reinforces its optimistic sentiment. The upward movement is not merely a momentary spike, it reflects strong buying interest and market confidence, suggesting that SHIB is poised for further gains. On the daily chart, the RSI is positioned at 81%, reflecting that Shiba Inu is approaching overbought levels. While this shows robust buying pressure, it also raises the possibility of a potential pullback if the current upsurge weakens. Will SHIB Break Through The $0.00002631 Barrier? It is important to note that the $0.00002045 level serves as a critical junction for SHIB’s current surge. Should the meme coin manage to maintain its upward momentum and break through this barrier, it could pave the way for further gains toward the $0.00002631 resistance level and beyond. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Whale Action Hints At Explosive 7,000% Growth Nonetheless, failure to break through the barrier could lead to a retracement to the previous support level of $0.00001272. When this level is breached, it may trigger deeper declines, potentially dropping toward $0.00000847 and other lower ranges. With a market capitalization exceeding $11 billion and a trading volume of over $1.3 billion, SHIB was trading at approximately $0.00001951, reflecting a 19.6% increase at the time of writing. Over the last 24 hours, its market cap has risen by 19.6%, while trading volume experienced a 101.33% increase.

Zhao’s release comes two days ahead of his scheduled release date this Sunday, Sep. 29. The BOP is legally allowed to release prisoners early if their release date falls on a weekend or holiday.  In April, Zhao was sentenced to four months in prison for violating the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) by failing to set up an adequate know-your-customer (KYC) program at Binance. As part of his guilty plea, Zhao also agreed to pay a $50 million fine and step down as CEO of the crypto exchange. The exchange agreed to pay a $4.3 billion fine to various U.S. regulators to settle related charges.  Though custodial sentences for violations of the BSA are unusual (former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2022 was sentenced only to probation), Zhao’s four-month sentence was lenient compared to the three years sought by federal prosecutors.  The judge overseeing Zhao’s case, U.S. District Judge Richard Jones of the Western District of Washington, seemed to be swayed by Zhao’s squeaky-clean criminal record and positive reputation – aided by 161 letters of support from his friends, family, and colleagues.

Notably, the meme coin has rallied by about 32% in the past seven days, allowing it to outperform many cryptocurrencies and meme coins. Notably, this rally has prompted many bullish forecasts for the cryptocurrency. Dogwifhat Back In The Spotlight Dogwifhat’s rise to prominence began in early 2024, as the meme coin community embraced it as a “Shiba Inu Killer.” Dogwifhat, which started the year around $0.15, was shot into the spotlight in March and April as part of the craze surrounding Solana-based meme coins in the first half of 2024. This saw the meme coin surging by over 3,100% to peak at $4.84. Although the meme coin’s price has corrected since then, it continues to be popular among meme coin investors and is supported by a strong online community. Related Reading: Historical Trends Put Bitcoin At $400,000 With Shocking Timeline Dogwifhat has posted incredible gains in September and is currently up by 9.5% in the past 24 hours. Renowned crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggests that Dogwifhat’s recent breakout of its multi-month downtrend is just the beginning. According to him, this move is one of the first signals of a broader altcoin rally, which he forecasted in a previous analysis. Furthermore, the analyst noted that WIF is on the cusp of beginning a new macro uptrend. The only other time $WIF broke out of it’s downtrend and flipped the 4H 200’s was back in February. After that the price of $WIF gained 1600% over the course of 48 days. Looks like we’re about to find out if history does repeat itself. pic.twitter.com/MhvWjHA9SS — Sito (@0xyusu) September 26, 2024 Adding to the positive sentiment, another crypto expert, Gumshoe, highlighted a key development in WIF’s market activity. According to him, $35 million worth of Dogwifhat has been transferred from crypto exchange Binance into self-custody wallets in the past seven days. Such withdrawal transfers suggest growing investor confidence in holding WIF long-term. According to a WIFUSDT chart posted on social media platform X by another crypto trader going by the name Sito, WIF’s breakout has seen the crypto flipping the 4-hour 200-moving average. The last time this technical move occurred was back in February, and it led to a staggering 1,600% gain over 48 days. Sito speculated that if history were to repeat itself, Dogwifhat could once again experience a massive price surge, potentially reaching $25 in the coming weeks. The only other time $WIF broke out of it’s downtrend and flipped the 4H 200’s was back in February. After that the price of $WIF gained 1600% over the course of 48 days. Looks like we’re about to find out if history does repeat itself. pic.twitter.com/MhvWjHA9SS — Sito (@0xyusu) September 26, 2024 What’s Next For Dogwifhat? At the time of writing, Dogwifhat (WIF) is trading at $2.4. Replicating a 1,600% jump might be more challenging this time around. Given the current price levels, it would require a much larger influx of capital to achieve such a dramatic increase in value compared to earlier this year. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Will Drive The Ethereum Price Back Above $3,000 Again However, this doesn’t take away the fact that the meme coin is at the cusp of a continued momentum to the upside. The first step is breaking above a July order block around $2.665. A successful break above this would set the stage for additional price gains up until its recent all-time high of $4.84.

These developments have since placed AVAX on the crosshairs of the bulls leading to a 25% surge in price in the last two weeks, reinforcing the token’s position as a long-term asset. Related Reading: Worldcoin Soars 31%: Will Network Upgrades Push WLD Price Higher? Avalanche’s focus on on-chain growth is made apparent by a recent announcement that will cement the platform’s position in the DeFi space. As time lets these developments mature, investors and traders holding AVAX might be in for a treat. $40 Million Allotted For Retro9000 To Encourage L1 Growth In an official X post, Avalanche reveals its new grants program named Retro9000. The program will reward developers who build projects on the Avalanche9000 testnet and deploy the finished product on the mainnet. This move comes as a way to “empower developers” on the platform, ensuring that development on Avalanche won’t cease. Retro9000: Up to $40m in retroactive grants for Avalanche L1s 🔺 This new grant program aims to reward developers who contribute to the testnet and launch their project on mainnet, empowering developers to do what they do best–innovate and build. More on Retro9000 👇 pic.twitter.com/qNXzosMV14 — Avalanche 🔺 (@avax) September 26, 2024 “While the current blockchain landscape offers countless opportunities, it comes with technical roadblocks, creating economic and logistical limitations that make building and deploying projects challenging,” stated Avalanche in a recent blog post. The program works by ranking submissions in a public leaderboard, allowing developers to build publicly, and allowing a community to form around their projects. However, the main focal point for the rewards system is the developers that test and ship their finished projects on the mainnet, further enhancing on-chain growth on the platform. Retro9000 is mainly concerned on the upcoming Avalanche9000 network upgrade. The program allows developers of all sizes to keep try the new developer environment whilst keeping the economic barrier low through funding using the $40 million allotted for the program. The cryptocurrency wallet and portfolio protocol, Core, said it would support its upcoming network upgrade, Avalanche9000, which will feature the Interchain Messaging Protocol (ICM). It promises much easier crosschain communication, thereby improving the user experience on this platform. Testnet builders, as you’re building out your L1 or L1 tooling on testnet, keep in mind that Core is helping cut your dev time by optimizing for the ability to move assets between chains and providing easy access to testnet support.

If this occurs, investors and traders are in with huge gains in the medium to long-term. Although the market environment is inherently bullish, the relative strength index (RSI) of the token remains strained by the near-constant upward trajectory that AVAX has followed in the past two weeks, possibly putting AVAX’s short term gains at risk.

42407525,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGcr,1727464885,Mango Markets Agrees to Destroy MNGO Tokens in SEC Settlement,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) settled charges with Mango DAO, Mango Labs LLC and Blockworks Foundation alleging that the MNGO token was an unregistered security and that the latter entities offered unregistered broker services.  The entities will destroy their MNGO tokens and ask crypto exchanges to stop trading the tokens, as well as pay $700,000 total as part of the settlement, which is still subject to a court's approval, the SEC announced Friday in a press release. The settlement comes just over a month after Mango DAO held an open vote on whether it should adopt the settlement offer proposal. The DAO voted on a settlement proposal with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) earlier this week as well, which passed unanimously.  Mango DAO members vote on proposals through the MNGO governance token. It's unclear what the project's future will look like without the token.  The SEC's press release noted that Mango DAO and Blockworks Foundation (no relation to the news and events business) sold $70 million worth of MNGO tokens starting in August 2021.  As part of the settlement, Mango DAO, Blockworks Foundation and Mango Labs are neither admitting nor denying the charges.  In a statement, SEC Acting Crypto and Cyber Unit Chief Jorge Tenreiro said any entity that offers ""securities-intermediary functions"" needs to register or otherwise be exempt from registration with the SEC.  ""Since the inception of our crypto enforcement program, our view has been that the label ‘DAO’ does not change the reality of who is behind a project, what activities they engage in, or whether their activities need to be registered. Nor does engaging in intermediation of securities with the aid of automated or open source software change the nature of such activities,"" he said in the statement.  Last year, Mango Markets – which has struggled to recover since Avraham Eisenberg drained more than $110 million worth of tokens from the exchange in 2022 – tried relaunching the decentralized trading venue.

42407517,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGMK,1727464451,Swan Bitcoin Claims Ex-Employees 'Stole' Its Mining Business at Tether’s Direction,"Swan Bitcoin has filed suit against a group of former employees and consultants, alleging they “hatched and executed a ‘rain and hellfire’ plan” to ""steal"" its lucrative bitcoin mining business with the help of Tether, Swan Bitcoin’s one-time ally and fundraising partner.  The lawsuit accuses six employees of looting Swan’s trade secrets – including “highly proprietary code,” hash-rate optimization techniques, and financial models – and using them to create an “illegal facsimile” of Swan’s bitcoin mining operation called Proton Management. After two months of pilfering and planning, the lawsuit claims, the coup-de-grace came on Aug. 8, when they and several other employees resigned “near-simultaneously” to join Proton.  The defendants did all of this, according to Swan, with the go-ahead from Tether. Though Tether is not a named defendant in the suit, a spokesperson for the company has denied any and all implications of wrongdoing.  The stablecoin giant had previously funded Swan’s bitcoin mining operation in Tasmania, Australia in 2023 and, by February, had entered into talks with Swan for another funding round. According to the suit, an advisor for Tether – Zach Lyons of Marlin Capital Partners – told Swan that Tether would lead Swan’s series C fundraising round with a $25 million investment, valuing Swan’s business at a whopping $1 billion.  Things were looking good for Swan, which had aspirations of going public. By July, according to the lawsuit, it was mining one out of every 50 bitcoins worldwide. Tether’s CFO Giancarlo Devasini seemed to be pleased with Swan’s CEO, Cory Klippsten, allegedly telling him “on multiple occasions that in his opinion Klippsten was the best CEO in the space.”  But, while praising Klippsten and pledging funding, Swan says Tether was double-dealing. According to the suit, Lyons began taking secret meetings with Swan’s former head of mining Raphael Zagary in (who is not named as a defendant in the suit) and other employees in late June, telling them that Swan had “no value” to Tether and suggesting that Swan’s employees could potentially leave Swan and go to Tether or another operator and “keep doing what [they’re] doing.”  In a July 11 meeting, Lyons allegedly told Zagary and former Swan Investment Director Santhiran Naidoo that Klippsten “has to realize [Tether] can take away [Swan’s mining business] tomorrow.”  With the tacit blessing of Tether, as well as an alleged agreement to provide “legal cover” for the coup, Swan claims, in mid-July Zagary began to “sow dissent and chaos at Swan, undermine Klippsten, and influence Swan’s consultants and employees to leave Swan”. The $25 million funding commitment from Tether, it became apparent, would no longer be coming.  The chaos took its toll on Swan, which by July 22, announced that it was dropping its IPO plan, shut down its managed mining unit and laid off some 45% of its staff. Its valuation plummeted, according to the suit, and it was forced to go back to the market seeking investment at a significantly lower valuation.  On Aug. 8, the defendants quit their jobs at Swan en masse, which Swan’s lawyers claim “blindsided” Swan (despite the fact that defendants were allegedly using their Swan email addresses and corporate Zoom accounts to coordinate with each other and Tether).  The next day, Friday, Aug. 9, Tether’s counsel served Swan with the “legal cover” it had allegedly promised the defendants – according to the lawsuit (which was improperly redacted), this came in the form of a “Notice of Event of Default” claiming that Swan had breached their funding agreement, 2040 Energy, with Tether because it was unable to “maintain the personnel necessary” to conduct business properly.  The following Monday, Swan says, Klippsten was “forced to resign” as CEO of 2040 Energy. The same day, Tether’s counsel allegedly informed Swan it had engaged the services of Proton Management – an entity that claimed “it can supply the services of certain former employees of Swan.”  “With that, as Swan would later learn, Defendants’ and the Swan conspirators’ coup was complete,” Swan’s lawyers wrote. “Defendant Proton, created by Defendant [Alex] Holmes, led by CEO Zagury and CIO Defendant Naidoo had created an illegal facsimile of Swan’s Bitcoin mining business.”  Ashley Ebersole, general counsel for 0x and a former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attorney, told CoinDesk that Swan's complaint ""seems to indicate that Tether is a potential bad actor here, but there are no legal claims made against it.""  ""The Complaint is pretty thin on evidence of actual wrongdoing by Tether and it’s not named as a defendant,"" Ebersole added. ""Maybe that’s because there isn’t evidence to support any claims against Tether, but complaints can always be amended if anything is uncovered.  A spokesperson for Tether told CoinDesk the company is “aware of recent allegations made in a lawsuit that mentions a subsidiary of Tether dedicated to proprietary mining and other investments.”  “While Tether is not a named defendant in the case, we have taken note of the claims and deny any implications of wrongdoing. Tether remains committed to enabling financial freedom, educational empowerment, energy sustainability, and data sovereignty. We believe our operations and conduct align with these values. As this is an ongoing legal matter, we will refrain from providing further comment at this time. We will continue to monitor the lawsuit and provide updates as appropriate. In the meantime, Tether’s business operations continue as usual,” the spokesperson added.

34054046,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645167,1727464400,"Bitcoin Futures Under Pressure: $64,000 Support Critical To Avert Long Squeeze","With Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a near three-month high of $66,000 on Friday, technical analyst InspoCrypto suggests that the BTC futures market is at a critical juncture, with the potential for further short squeezes and the importance of maintaining support around the $64,000 level. Divergence Despite BTC Uptrend The analyst recently noted in his writing that the latest data shows that the BTC/USDT price chart hit a Friday high of $66,106, reflecting bullish sentiment as the cryptocurrency continues to climb. Over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has seen a steady price increase, indicating optimism among investors. The True Strength Index (TSI) shows a slight divergence, indicating indecision in the market, but the upward trend remains intact. Related Reading: Solana Price (SOL) Pushes Higher: Surge Shows No Signs of Slowing Trading volume also plays a key role in understanding market dynamics, and current figures show a volume delta of $675.457 million, indicating a higher volume of buy orders than sell orders. This suggests buyers are currently dominating the market, supporting the bullish momentum. Notably, there has been a significant amount of short liquidations, totaling $331.24 million. This indicates that as Bitcoin’s price rises, many short positions are forced to close, further driving the price upward. In contrast, long liquidations remain comparatively low, suggesting that those holding long positions are confident in the market’s direction. InspoCrypto’s heatmap analysis of Hyblock Capital shows a concentration of short liquidation levels around the $63,000 to $64,000 area. This clustering indicates a likely short squeeze that could push prices even higher. However, the analyst shows that long liquidation levels appear more scattered, presenting a lower risk of cascading liquidations on the long side. Analyst Predicts Further Bitcoin Price Surge InspoCrypto further found that open interest (OI) in Bitcoin futures is rising, indicating increased interest in the market and a potential buildup for significant price movements. The heatmap shows strong concentrations of open interest around the $64,000 to $65,000 range, suggesting that any price movement beyond these levels could trigger volatility as traders adjust their positions. The funding ratio currently stands at 763.8, indicating that the longs are paying off the shorts, adding to the bullish sentiment in the market. However, the analyst warns that a high funding ratio also signals a risk of long liquidation if the market unexpectedly shifts. Related Reading: XRP Struggles Below $0.60 – Metrics Reveal Growing Selling Pressure Looking ahead, InspoCrypto anticipates that the next 24 hours could see continued upward momentum as shorts are squeezed. However, the elevated funding rates could lead to long liquidations if the market is downturned. By the end of the week, InspoCrypto believes that if the current buying pressure continues, the Bitcoin price could reach prices around $68,000, inching closer to its all-time high of $73,700 in March this year. At the time of writing, BTC has seen a slight retracement to its current trading price of $65,800.

The world's largest digital currency stayed above the $60K mark throughout the week, after swinging in and out of that threshold in the previous few weeks. ""Bitcoin ETFs have seen the largest inflows since July 22, showing strong demand from institutional investors after the recent Fed’s rate cut. Investors have become more bullish on crypto and are anticipating further cuts at the Fed’s next meeting on Nov. 7,"" said Lucy Hu, Senior Analyst, Metalpha BTC touched the $65K mark on Thursday, boosted by a renewal of bullish sentiments by investors. China's fresh stimulus measures also went into effect on Friday . The People's Bank of China lowered the seven-day reverse repurchase rate to 1.50% from 1.70% and the required reserve ratio for major banks to 9.5% from 10.0%. BTC's rise on Thursday also came ahead of the expiration of $5.8B options on Friday, which could result in a rise in volatility in the cryptocurrency market, Bloomberg reported citing analysts. ""Crypto investors were further encouraged by Thursday’s economic stimulus unveiled by China’s PBOC. This has led to a surge in Asian stocks after some reports suggested Chinese authorities are considering adding 1 trillion yuan of capital to its biggest banks to shore up the economy,"" Hu said. The cryptocurrency had seen a rise in its prices from last week after the Federal Reserve delivered a supersized rate cut. Naturally, crypto prices are still highly correlated to equity performance. However, investor sentiment seems to have flipped to a ‘buy the dip’ mode, and risk-reward favors a continued rally with no or little downside catalysts in sight at the moment, said Augustine Fan, Head of Insights, SOFA.org.

42407519,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZLGSw,1727462312,The Paradox of the Bitcoin Maximalist,"Bitcoin was created in response to the Great Financial Crisis as the people’s currency to bypass the manipulation and mismanagement of the financial systems by governments, financial institutions and special interest groups. And while there’s an ongoing debate on whether or not Bitcoin is highly concentrated, it is undeniable that it is becoming increasingly so with governments, ETFs dominated by financial institutions, corporations and major whales adding to their share on every price correction. Today, the top 15 holders of BTC possess about 7.5% of the total supply.  Somewhere along the way, an inherent paradox emerged within the Bitcoin maximalist community: believing in the ideals and purpose of Bitcoin, yet celebrating and depending upon the very institutions Bitcoin was built to circumvent.  Current institutional influence  So, as governments and Wall Street squeeze in on crypto and influence its volatility, while the decisions of central banks on interest rates zig-zag the price of Bitcoin in high single digits within hours, can we still walk the original path? Or are we heading toward a dead-end through excess enthusiasm?  The fact that Trump’s proposal in Nashville to make Bitcoin a strategic reserve excited the crypto community might be telling of where we’re at. Institutional activity signals “major gains” the everyday holder of Bitcoin. Promises of financial gains are overriding any allegiance to decentralized principles. There is an emanating “look the other way"" that neglects the very real scenario in which Bitcoin becomes indistinguishable from a traditional financial asset.  We saw lines blur with Venezuela’s attempt to support the Bolivar with their self-created Petro-cryptocurrency back in 2018. Whilst thwarted, plenty of other power-grabbing initiatives are clearly unfolding at an alarming rate. The government of El Salvador is buying one Bitcoin a day; the FBI recently uncovered North Korea’s fraudulent social engineering schemes to steal Bitcoin from their people; U.S-based MicroStrategy holds nearly 250,000 Bitcoins.  Soon, Bitcoin may be inseparable from the influence of traditional capital markets. When the Bitcoin price moves in sync with stocks and interest rates, we’re in a dangerous place. Failure to curtail growing institutional influence on Bitcoin could result in centralized decentralized finance. Yes, in case you’ve not considered it: Ce-DeFi is a reality that we’re facing.  At ground level, this could extend to institutional influence over mining operations and node providers, undermining principles of distributed control. If corporate interests meld into blockchains themselves, not just into cryptocurrencies, ecosystems could become susceptible to  data manipulation and censorship measures. Big top-down decisions could start to compromise privacy and pseudonymity customs. Eventually regulatory advances could yield.  However, dystopia is not an inevitable outcome. The onus to act, with purpose, still lies with crypto natives, and more specifically those who claim to be Bitcoin maximalists. While institutional dominion is a problem, the more immediate problem is the lack of acceptance that Bitcoin is a people’s currency. The sooner it is accepted that Bitcoin may be treated like any other asset, the sooner that full focus can be given to maximizing its value for everyone. If global crypto adoption is to truly manifest, minds must change and grassroots action must be taken.  Crypto investors, innovators, and influencers must recognize their power. Their decisions can greatly influence the market in ways that extend beyond their investments. Through the projects they interact with, the way they talk about crypto, and the information that they seek and share, Bitcoin’s sovereign potential can still be championed. Open-source initiatives that target core communities must be propagated sufficiently. Those such as the OpenSats Education Initiative, a grant-oriented scheme that delivers educational content for all levels of expertise, encourage people to obtain knowledge rather than chase profits. It is ultimately the expansion of knowledge that will birth new innovative utilities of Bitcoin and drive its value to a greater degree than investment can.  In placing open-source projects at the front and center, blockchain technology is kept accessible to everyone, in spite of rising institutional investment. Crypto enthusiasts and everyday investors will always maintain sovereignty over the initiatives that they engage with. They must thus be diligent in favoring those that promote decentralized principles.  Expanding decentralized governance  Decentralized governance as a notion is the most transformative quality of blockchain technology. Of course, the intended revolution is centered in finance, but the industry must not pass on the chance to change how systems are governed. In fact, the risk of institutions dominating Bitcoin should inspire the community to double-down on innovating governance models. This could include more participation in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs), where anyone can propose changes to the Bitcoin protocol. Individuals must use their power to influence decisions as often as possible.  Social media's ability to influence public opinion has to be leveraged persistently. Popular crypto influences have to take responsibility for the content they create. It must increasingly emphasize Bitcoin's decentralized, censorship-resistant origins. Audiences should be constantly reminded that Bitcoin is a tool for financial freedom, not profit maximization. Strengthening values that naturally repel institutionalized control will drive people to seek more fervently the  regulatory protection of Bitcoin. Policymakers can be influenced to oppose regulations that give excessive power to centralized entities. Using social media to spark discussions that uphold cultural values will affect regulatory advances.  It’s clear that the rising influence of major institutions over Bitcoin warrants deeper reflection. While their involvement may appear to validate crypto’s growing legitimacy, we must ask at what cost we cosign this narrative. Short-term gains are exciting for retail investors, but the current path leads to murky waters. The once-revolutionary, people-power asset now risks becoming a tool for the financial elite. If we aren’t careful, the spirit of self-sovereignty will lose face, corrupted by the corporations it was designed to circumvent. The time to act is now.

While other cryptocurrencies have seen impressive gains, XRP has only managed a modest 2% increase. Analysts and investors suggest this underperformance is due to growing interest in other projects, diverting attention and capital from the token. Adding to this concern, user participation in the XRP Ledger blockchain has declined, raising questions about the project’s long-term prospects. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Eyes 20% Price Surge – Funding Rate Suggests Increasing Demand Key data from on-chain analytics firm Santiment reveals a notable drop in user engagement on the Ledger, contributing to a sense of unease among investors. As they watch other altcoins posting double-digit gains, fear and uncertainty are mounting within the XRP community. Investors are now looking for signs of a turnaround, but until the price can reignite user interest and regain momentum, it risks falling further behind in this bullish market cycle. With the market in flux, all eyes are on XRP to see if it can overcome these challenges and join the broader crypto rally. XRP Facing Serious Risk XRP is trading below the critical $0.60 mark, a psychological level that has acted as resistance for the past few months. Despite a recent surge in the crypto market, XRP shows signs of a potential retracement. While the altcoin initially benefited from the broader bullish sentiment, its weakening market signals suggest it may struggle to sustain this momentum soon. One concerning indicator is the decline in user engagement on the XRP Ledger blockchain. Key metrics from Santiment show that XRP’s price Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence dropped to -74.46% yesterday. The price DAA divergence measures whether user participation is increasing alongside the price. A declining DAA, especially when the price is rising, is a bearish signal because fewer users interact with the network despite the price increase. This divergence suggests that the recent uptrend could be weak and unsustainable. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Consolidates in Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Reveals $160 Target On Breakout If XRP continues to struggle and fails to close above the $0.60 resistance, it may face a more significant downturn. The altcoin could see a deep correction, potentially falling to lower demand levels around $0.55. Investors are now closely monitoring XRP’s price action to see if it can reclaim the $0.60 level and regain momentum or if further declines are on the horizon. Price Levels To Watch XRP trades at $0.589 after two weeks of sideways movement, fluctuating between $0.57 and $0.59. Despite several attempts, the price has failed to break above the crucial $0.60 resistance level, leaving it at risk of a downturn. XRP is now approximately 6% above its daily 200 moving average (MA), which sits at $0.548—a critical support that has provided stability in the past. For bullish momentum to build, XRP must break past the $0.60 barrier and aim for higher supply levels around $0.65. This move would signal renewed strength and potentially trigger a more substantial rally. However, the current price action appears weak, with limited upward momentum. If XRP fails to hold above the $0.60 level, a retest of lower demand zones around $0.55 is expected. Related Reading: SUI Price Sits 40% Below All-Time High As TVL Approaches $1 Billion The worst-case scenario for XRP would be an extended period of this sideways range, lacking a decisive breakout in either direction.

The fund, issued by REX Shares and Tuttle Capital Management, promises two times the daily performance to the stock of MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software mogul turned bitcoin strategy company, the most leverage any fund tied to MSTR gives.  A similar fund, the Defiance Daily Target 1.75X Long MicroStrategy ETF (MSTX), promises traders returns of 175% of the daily percentage change in the share price of MSTR. MSTX went live on Aug. 15 and has so far taken in roughly $857 million, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, putting it in the top 8% of launches this year.  “Both have robust liquidity,” Balchunas said in a post on X. “I didn't think there was room for both (esp so quickly), it just [shows] how much 'need for speed' there is out there.”  MicroStrategy has been an attractive investment for traders looking to gain exposure to bitcoin {{BTC}} without directly investing in the digital asset, as shares of the company are highly correlated with the token due to MicroStrategy's holding 252,220 BTC.  MicroStrategy outperforms bitcoin and tech in current market rally  Bitcoin's price has just exceeded $66,000 for the first time since July 31. At that time, MicroStrategy was priced at $168; it is now trading at almost $178, $10 a share higher. As MicroStrategy is trading higher while bitcoin effectively has been flat since then, this shows that MicroStrategy is leading the current rally.  Another development can be seen with the divergence between MicroStrategy and NVIDIA (NVDA). Both assets were in lockstep for the past month, but since Sept. 19, MicroStrategy has gone on from strength to strength while NVIDIA has flatlined.

34050629,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=645007,1727456406,"Here’s Who Has Been Driving The Bitcoin Price Recovery Above $65,000","Bitcoin is now trading above the $65,000 price level for the first time in two months, leaving the $63,000 resistance level behind. This interesting increase has seen Bitcoin increase by almost 23% from a September low of $53,400 on September 6, pushing many holders into profitability. According to Santiment, this price action has been mostly fueled by increased activity from whales and sharks, with the on-chain analytics platform noting a huge accumulation trend among them. Sharks And Whales Continue To Accumulate BTC Recent shifts in market dynamics worldwide have propelled Bitcoin back to the forefront of investor portfolios since mid-September. According to data from Santiment, Bitcoin’s upward price movement has been largely supported by increased accumulation from investors. The on-chain analytics platform revealed that many wallets holding ten or more BTC have been steadily accumulating additional Bitcoin over the past six months. This consistent buying behavior has played a critical role in stabilizing and propping up the price, especially during market corrections when Bitcoin has faced downward pressure. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Will Drive The Ethereum Price Back Above $3,000 Again Notably, these addresses have accumulated $4.08 billion worth of BTC in the past six months, and their collective holdings currently stand at 16.19 million. Santiment’s data also shows that this accumulation trend gained significant momentum starting in mid-September just after the Fed reduced the base interest rate, indicating a renewed wave of confidence among these Bitcoin investors. Current State Of Bitcoin As noted by NewsBTC, September has always been a crucial month for Bitcoin’s price performance in the last quarter of the year. Interestingly, what looked to be a bearish month for Bitcoin in the first two weeks has now played out as a forerunner for a potential surge in the last quarter of 2024. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Bullish 50% Rally To $0.16, But Will A Crash Come First? At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $65,470 and has been up by 2.6% in the past 24 hours. Institutional investors have resumed their investments in Bitcoin since the beginning of the week. This has seen spot Bitcoin funds witness consecutive days of inflows since the beginning of the week. Particularly, they received $365.7 million in net inflows in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has also seen a notable increase in open interest as investors pile up. According to Coinglass, the Bitcoin open interest now stands at $35.90 billion across multiple exchanges, reflecting a 3.53% increase in the past 24 hours. As Bitcoin’s price continues to attract attention from traders across the globe, the surge in open interest could act as a catalyst for further price increases. The next step for Bitcoin’s price is a bullish break above the July high of $70,162. Surpassing this level and keeping the momentum could open the stage for Bitcoin to easily break into new all-time highs in October.

The PBoC's recent measures to boost liquidity, including rate cuts, are significant and unexpected, driving market optimism. Bitcoin's strong correlation with liquidity, combined with bullish technical indicators and upcoming catalysts, suggests a potential explosive rally. Despite recent volatility, Bitcoin's macroeconomic environment and technical setup indicate substantial upside potential, with a possible peak early next year. Thesis Summary Stocks are at all-time highs, Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD)is back above $63,000, and we are even seeing outperformance in the riskier segments of the market (altcoins and small caps). This has a lot to do with the Fed, but more to do with the People’s Bank of China, and ultimately boils down to liquidity. I expect liquidity dynamics to continue to improve in the medium term, and Bitcoin, which acts as a liquidity proxy, is set to reach new highs. There are many bullish catalysts coming together which suggest we could see an explosive year-end rally. In my last article , when Bitocin hovered around $56,000 I pointed out the specific reasons Bitcoin was selling off, and why I remained bullish. Price action is now proving us right, and there are even more bullish catalysts on the horizon. China Says Go The PBoC came out on Tuesday and announced numerous measures to help boost their economy and increase liquidity. The Chinese Central Bank said it would be cutting the Reverse Repo Rate by half a percentage point, which is expected to increase liquidity by around one trillion yuan. On top of that, rates for existing mortgages will be cut, and down payments on existing homes will be lowered to 15% This is a huge move for China, which has been slow to tap into monetary and fiscal stimulus but seems to have finally relented. While this could lead to negative effects down the road, markets have cheered these moves so far. In effect, in the last month, we have seen the two largest and most important Central Banks in the world carry out significant policy changes, and in both cases, investors have been surprised. Few would have actually expected a 50 bps rate cut a few months ago, and fewer even would have expected China to come out and cut their rates and stimulate their housing market. Why Liquidity Matters (Especially To Bitcoin) Liquidity is perhaps the most important variable that moves markets today. Our debt-driven economies need constant stimulus from Central Banks in order to thrive, and this is something markets understand. US liquidity can be roughly calculated by adding up the Fed balance sheet and the reverse repo facility and subtracting the Treasury General Account. Extrapolate this to other countries and you can also calculate global liquidity. And in terms of determining global liquidity, the two most important banks are the Fed and PBoC. SPX and Fed net liquidity (TV) The chart above overlays the SPX with a measure of Fed liquidity developed by a TradingView user. We can see how stocks hold a strong correlation with liquidity. This is doubly true for Bitcoin. Bitcoin and global liquidity (Redfin) Bitcoin, which can be seen by many as a monetary hedge, holds a very strong correlation with liquidity, sometimes even acting as a leading indicator. Since its inception, Bitcoin has benefited from increased monetary stimulus. With the battle against inflation seemingly won, the Fed cutting rates, and now the PBoC joining the party, there’s not much to stop Bitcoin from exploding here, and this is just one of many bullish signals. Clear Bullish Signs While we have seen some volatility in the last month, there are plenty of reasons to stay bullish, especially now. The Bitcoin Cycle Halving Cycle (CryptoCon) The famous four-year Bitcoin cycle that happens around the halving, suggests that a Bitcoin top could occur sometime early next year. In past cycles, Bitcoin typically reached a top of around 366 days to 548 days after the halving. The last halving took place on April 19th. Seasonality also suggests that October, November, and December should be strong months for Bitcoin. Options and CZ release We’ve also seen some bullish news come out recently around Bitcoin. For starters, options have been approved for Bitcoin ETFs . While it is unclear what the effect will be long-term Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies made some very bullish comments on X. With today’s approval by the SEC to list and trade Bitcoin ETF options, I shared that we are on the verge of witnessing the most extraordinary upside of vol in financial history. I felt this deserved a fuller explanation, so I want to highlight a few characteristics of Bitcoin, the nature of the regulated options market, and the powerful combination of the two. Without exaggeration, this marks the most monumental advancement possible for the crypto market. Source: Bravenewcoin On top of that, Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao will soon be released from prison . Will this hardly have a “fundamental” effect on the price of Bitcoin, it will certainly serve to re-ignite interest and investor enthusiasm. Altcoin Rally The fact that this latest rally is being led by altcoins is also quite bullish, showing that there’s a lot more depth to this rally. TOTAL3 (TV) We can see this in the breakout on TOTAL3, which measures the crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin and Ethereum USD (ETH-USD) Technical Analysis And, of course, the technical chart looks more bullish than ever. Bitcoin TA (Trendspider) I pointed out to subscribers a few weeks ago the divergence we were forming in the RSI, just as we also got a bullish cross and sentiment was at its lowest point. Since then, we have broken above the key EMAs, and even broken out of the channel we had been in over the last 3 months. While we may retest the EMAs soon, the stage is now set for a push to my next target of around $100,000. Takeaway All in all, Bitcoin continues to show great strength and should continue to move up as the macro picture supports this. I think Bitcoin could top early next year, but we still have plenty of upside left before that.",POSITIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723787-china-gives-green-light-its-bitcoin-season?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34049860.jpeg

Dogecoin, the world’s largest meme coin by market cap, is up 16% over the last trading week. Shiba Inu and Pepe rallied in the same period, adding 37% and 27%, respectively. The expansion of meme coin prices has also been a boom to DogWifHat (WIF). Solana’s largest meme coin by market cap is up 14% on the last day, pushing weekly gains to over 31%. At the current valuation, WIF is the fourth most valuable coin, trailing Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe. DogWifHat Whale Accumulating, Meme Coin Soaring Lookonchain data reveals that a meme coin whale accumulates as WIF prices tick higher. Tracking the address’ movements, the largest WIF holder, data shows, appears to be steadily accumulating. Related Reading: Stacks: New Network Upgrades Push STX Price Up By 18% – Details By buying as prices begin to recover from their August and September lows, the move is an endorsement of the meme coin’s potential in the coming months. On September 26, the whale borrowed 2 million USDC and bought 894,854 WIF at $2.24. Adding to his stash, the address now controls over 32 million WIF. This holding, Lookonchain analysts estimate, pushes the whale’s profits to over $86 million. However, the whale’s borrowing of USDC and purchase of WIF is not the first time. Mid this week, the same address borrowed 4.5 million USDC from Kamino and bought 2.55M WIF at $1.76. Looking at this trend, it is evident that the whale expects prices to continue printing higher highs. The daily chart shows that the meme coin is picking up steam. After sinking to March 2024 lows, the meme coin has recovered, doubling to spot rates. If WIF prices soar above $2.8 and July highs, there could be more room for growth. Ultimately, the medium-term target would be $4.8, a level last printed in March. However, for this to happen, WIF prices must more than double from spot rates. Will WIF Follow Popcat And Register Fresh Highs? The likelihood of WIF printing new all-time highs in the coming weeks or months cannot be discounted. Popcat, another meme coin on Solana, recently broke higher, registering new all-time highs above $1. At spot rates, the token is up nearly 120% in Q3 2024, attracting interest from whales. Related Reading: Ethereum: Analyst Sets $2,820 As ETH’s Next Key Level to Watch, Here’s Why After exiting for a loss, losing $611,000, Lookonchain data shows that the whale re-entered the Popcat market, spending $1.29 million worth of SOL to buy 1.3 million POPCAT at around $1. From the daily chart, a close above $1 will be crucial in sustaining the upside momentum.

""FOMO is Back: Are You Holding Enough Bitcoin and Altcoins to Ride the New Wave,"" is the title of 10X Research's Markus Thielen's latest analysis. ""With bitcoin breaking above $65,000, we anticipate a swift move toward $70,000, followed by new all-time highs in the near term.""  Thielen took note of a sharp increase in stablecoin minting following the Fed's July meeting, at which it left rates unchanged but indicated a September easing was likely. Nearly $10 billion in stablecoin minting ensued in the subsequent weeks, said Thielen, flooding the crypto markets with liquidity and sharply surpassing spot ETF flows.  Of particular interest, said Thielen, Circle's USDC accounted for 40% of recent stablecoin inflows, a far higher share versus Tether's USDT than is typical. It's important, he said, as while USDT minting on TRON is typically associated with capital preservation, USDC minting could indicate a rise in DeFi activity.  Noting that 55% of currently mined bitcoins are coming from Chinese mining pools, Thielen said that country's massive monetary and fiscal stimulus measures – announced just after the Fed rate cut – could trigger large capital outflows from China and into cryptos.  ""The likelihood of a Q4 rally is exceptionally high, with gains likely front-loaded,"" Thielen concluded. ""A major surge could be on the horizon, sparking even more FOMO across the crypto space.""  Bitcoin currently is higher by 2.3% over the past 24 hours and nearly 12% month-over-month to $66,300, its strongest level since late July.

Early august saw Bitcoin dip to USD 49,577. However, Bitcoin recovered quickly and is trading around USD 63,000, with the 200-day moving average acting as resistance. The Fed's interest rate cut could stimulate financial markets, benefiting Bitcoin, which might see significant gains up to USD 100,000+x by spring 2025. Sentiment and seasonality are turning bullish; a breakout rally may be delayed but any pullbacks present buying opportunities. Since the beginning of the year, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and all the Bitcoin spot ETFs like IBIT , FBTC , BITO , ARKB , BITB , HODL , BRRR , EZBC , ARKW , BITX , BITQ , WGMI , BTCW , BTF , STCE and BETH as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ) are up by more than 50%. While prices have been strongly trending higher during the first few months, the Bitcoin rally has stalled out since mid of March. Significant milestones, such as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the recent halving event in April 2024, had further fueled optimism and created too much euphoria in spring. Now, more than six months into a sideways torture, the end of the consolidation seems to be in sight. Review In the last five weeks, Bitcoin once again lived up to its volatile reputation, keeping investors on edge with a wide trading range of around USD 13,000. After prices briefly fell to just under USD 50,000 (USD 49,577) in early August due to the “Nikkei Carry Trade Crash,” ( NKY:IND ) they recovered to USD 65,103 by the end of the month, driven by bullish stock markets. From here, however, Bitcoin was pushed down again to USD 52,546 on September 6th within just two weeks. The oversold condition at this low point brought about a significant recovery, so that Bitcoin is currently trading around USD 63,000 and knocking on its flat 200-day moving average (USD 63,935). Given the overall relatively stable situation in the stock markets and the generous first US interest rate cut in four years (minus 50 basis points), the correction and consolidation phase we correctly predicted is likely now in its final stages. After all, the end of restrictive monetary policy should initially lift almost all asset classes in the coming months. The crypto sector in particular is likely to benefit from this. Currently, Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, is still about USD 10,750 or 16.5% away from its all-time high of USD 73,793 on March 14th. However, Bitcoin’s dominance has been steadily increasing since the major low in November 2022 and recently reached over 58.5% of the total market capitalization of the crypto sector. Polygon 2.0 As always, there were plenty of exciting developments in the crypto ecosystem. In particular, the upcoming conversion of Polygon’s MATIC ( MATIC-USD ) token to the new POL token in September 2024 could prove to be an opportunity given its depressed price of USD 0.40. Major crypto exchanges like Binance support the migration, which is part of the “Polygon 2.0” update and aims for unlimited scalability and unified liquidity. Additionally, new Layer-2 projects like Pepe Unchained launched, aiming to improve Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. These developments underscore the continuous innovation and evolution in the crypto sector. However, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has been an underperformer throughout the entire bull market of the last two years and has lost almost 50% from its spring high at the peak. Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart – Handle approaches its closing Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of September 22nd, 2024. (Tradingview) Since the autumn of 2021 and the all-time high of USD 69,000 at that time, a large cup has formed with the pullback to USD 15,479 and the new all-time high on March 14th at USD 73,794. As suspected, Bitcoin has been working on the corresponding handle as part of the larger “cup-and-handle” since spring. Within this handle, the consolidation/correction should be played out primarily over time and less through deep price pullbacks. This process is now well advanced. Nevertheless, it could still take a few more months until the final completion of the handle. Obviously, for the successful completion of the cup-and-handle formation, Bitcoin needs a breakout to new all-time highs, i.e., at least above USD 73,794. Since the horizontal resistance zone is somewhat “skewed,” the final upward breakout would probably only be confirmed with prices above approximately USD 77,000. However, any further price increase above USD 70,000 already indicates that Bitcoin prices tend to strive upwards and ultimately aim for new highs. Bitcoin – Not yet ready to launch the breakout rally On the downside, the August low of USD 49,577 should ideally not be undercut anymore. Otherwise, the technical chart picture would significantly deteriorate. Within the handle, pullbacks to the region of about USD 52,000 to 53,000 would still be possible and should be cautiously factored in. In sum, the weekly chart remains neutral. At least, the slight downward trend could soon be negated with a rise above the August high of USD 65,103. However, the stochastic oscillator continues to decline and might need more time until a trend reversal. While the heavily overbought condition from spring has been completely eliminated, an ideal oversold situation does not (yet) exist. Overall, the weekly chart gives the impression that the start of the breakout rally could be delayed. Bitcoin Daily Chart – 200-day moving average is resistance. Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of September 22nd, 2024. (Tradingview) On the daily chart, Bitcoin slipped below its 200-day moving average (USD 63,937) in early August and has not yet been able to sustainably recapture it. This is generally rather bearish. At the same time, the stochastic oscillator is bullishly embedded in its overbought zone. The uptrend is locked-in and could therefore soon lead to a return above the 200-day moving average line. However, as soon as the bullishly embedded status is lost, the stochastic oscillator will have a lot of room to move downwards to its oversold zone. A direct rise to over 70,000 USD is therefore rather unlikely. A movement to the upper edge of the downward trend channel in the area of about 68,000 USD would probably be the maximum expectation. However, it’s still about 5,000 USD or about 8% away from there. Overall, the daily chart is currently in a super-bullish embedded uptrend as long as both lines of the stochastic oscillator are above 80. Nevertheless, the air has already become a bit thin in the short term, hence a larger breather in the coming weeks would not be surprising. If the bulls fail at the 200-day moving average line, the situation will deteriorate significantly. Sentiment Bitcoin – Balanced sentiment Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of September 21st, 2024. (Bitcoin Magazine Pro) The “Crypto Fear & Greed Index” is currently in neutral territory at 54 out of 100 points. CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index as of September 21st, 2024. (Coinmarketcap) The “CMC Crypto Fear & Greed Index” from CoinMarketCap comes to the same conclusion. After several instances of selling panic in the past two months, sentiment has now calmed down. At the same time, the partially sharp price setbacks have likely brought enough skepticism back into the market. In this respect, we consider the sentiment to be cleared and suspect that the sentiment pendulum can swing towards significantly increased optimism values in the coming months. Overall, the sentiment depicts a balanced mood and no longer stands in the way of a new rally in the sector. Seasonality Bitcoin – Seasonality turns bullish in the second week of October Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of May 3rd, 2024. (Seasonax) Time and again over the past months, we had pointed out that seasonal statistics are not favorable to Bitcoin during the summer months. However, right on cue with today’s start of autumn, the seasonal pattern turns bullish within the coming three weeks. Particularly the second half of October has often been characterized by explosive price increases in the past. In summary, Bitcoin has reached its seasonal low point and should therefore be able to take off again from mid-October onwards Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold, Bitcoin – Not yet ready to launch the breakout rally Bitcoin/Gold ratio, daily chart as of September 22nd, 2024. (Tradingview) At prices of around USD 63,000 for one Bitcoin and approximately USD 2,620 for a troy ounce of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ), one currently needs to pay about 24 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin. Conversely, a troy ounce of gold currently costs about 0.0415 Bitcoin. Against the strong gold price, the consolidating Bitcoin has lost over 38% at its peak in recent months. A trend reversal is not yet visible on the ratio chart. Instead, the 200-day moving average (approximately 27.5) is now turning downwards, while the ratio itself is clearly trading below this closely watched average line. In summary, the ratio analysis once again confirms the still intact consolidation/correction in Bitcoin. An end is not yet in sight, particularly because the gold price, within its strong upward trend, is likely on its way towards USD 3,000. Macro Update – Turning point in US monetary policy Fed Balance Sheet vs. fed Funds rate, as of September 18th, 2024. (Holger Zschäpitz) The Federal Reserve (Fed) lowered interest rates for the first time in over four years on September 18th, 2024. The benchmark rate was reduced by 0.5 percentage points to a range of 4.75% to 5.0%. This decision marks a significant shift in the Fed’s monetary policy after a period of continuous rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The rate cut comes against the backdrop of easing inflation and a slight cooling of the labor market in the United States. The implications of this rate cut and the official end of restrictive monetary policy are expected to be far-reaching. For consumers and businesses, this could mean cheaper loans, potentially boosting investment and consumption. Financial markets initially reacted positively to the decision, as lower interest rates make riskier assets like stocks more attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Additionally, the Fed signaled that another rate cut of 0.5 percentage points is possible later this year, supporting expectations for an expansion of loose monetary policy. However, the rate cut also carries risks. There is a danger that inflation could rise again if the economy is stimulated too much. Furthermore, the US dollar may continue to lose value, impacting international trade and global financial markets. The Fed must therefore navigate a delicate balance between promoting economic growth and controlling inflation. The coming months will reveal how this monetary policy decision affects the US economy and global markets. Markets expect another US rate cut of 0.5% by the end of the year. Market-implied development of US interest rates as of September 18th, 2024. (Holger Zschäpitz) Already, markets are pricing in significantly larger rate cuts than what the Fed has indicated so far. The Fed’s projections have shifted downward, with markets now expecting the US benchmark interest rate to be at 4.4% by the end of this year, 3.4% by the end of 2025, and 2.9% in 2026. US-recession risk, as of September 20th, 2024. (Pretiorates.com) The “heartbeat” of the US economy also indicates a high risk of recession, despite a recent sharp increase in the “Citi US Economic Surprise Index.” At the same time, three-month US Treasury bills are trading higher than ten-year bonds, which often signals an end to a rate cycle and a trend reversal. Parallels to 2007 Interest rate cut by 50 basis points in 2007 and 2024, as of September 18th, 2024. (Sven Henrich) The first rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September 2007 marked the beginning of an era of loose monetary policy in response to the impending financial crisis. Similar to today, the Fed attempted to steer economic development through rate cuts at that time. The current situation in September 2024 shows definite parallels as the Fed initiates another rate shift, but this time against a backdrop of an recovering economy and declining inflation. In both cases - 2007 and 2024 - the initial rate cut sparked optimism in financial markets. Currently, predicting the long-term effects of this monetary policy is challenging. The rate cuts in 2007 did not prevent the financial crisis; instead, they ultimately pierced that bubble. From a market psychology perspective, one can conclude in hindsight that the rate cuts in 2007 gradually and unintentionally shifted participants’ perceptions towards questioning “Is it really that bad?”. Ultimately, mass psychology plays a crucial role in international financial markets and regularly leads to phenomena such as herd behavior, speculative bubbles, or panic selling. Investors and traders are often influenced by collective moods—euphoria or fear—which can lead to irrational market movements. Understanding these psychological dynamics is essential for market analysts and investors to better assess market trends and identify potential exaggerations. Insights from mass psychology help explain and anticipate often irrational behavior. Blueprint for the next 12 months If one takes events from 2007 as a blueprint for the next twelve months, one might expect the following developments in financial markets: Initial Optimism : Following the first rate cut, there could initially be a positive reaction in stock markets until early 2025 as investors hope for economic stimulation. Particularly small- and mid-cap stocks currently appear undervalued compared to real US economic indicators. Therefore, the Russell 2000 Index has potential to outperform the S&P 500. Increasing Volatility : By year-end, market volatility could increase significantly as uncertainties about economic development and potential issues within the financial system grow. Additionally, the upcoming US presidential election could contribute to unrest. Credit Crisis : Signs of a credit crisis may develop, especially if certain sectors (like real estate back then) come under pressure. Flight to Safety : Investors may increasingly shift towards safe-haven assets like government bonds and gold. Bitcoin might not necessarily serve as a safe haven. Sectoral Differences : Some sectors may come under more pressure than others, similar to 2007 when the financial sector was particularly affected. International Spread : What begins as a local problem could increasingly spill over into international markets. Further Monetary Easing : Central banks—especially the Fed—may be forced into more aggressive rate cuts and other measures to stabilize markets over time. Psychologically, market participants will interpret this as an acknowledgment of dramatic circumstances. Bitcoin 4-year cycle Overall, the first US interest rate cut in four years is likely to initially stimulate financial markets and foster optimism. In essence, almost all asset classes could see significant gains over the next three to four months. Bitcoin cycles, as of September 1st, 2024. (x.com/apsk32) This should also benefit Bitcoin and the entire crypto sector. If the four-year cycle holds true, significant price increases up to at least USD 100,000 or more could be expected by next spring. At the same time, plans should already be made and preparations taken to timely realize profits during foreseeable exaggeration phases since 2025 could become quite uncomfortable. Conclusion: Bitcoin – Not yet ready to launch the breakout rally Although the consolidation or correction in Bitcoin has now been ongoing for over six months, the trend reversal is not yet a done deal. It may take until mid or late October, or even until the US elections, for things to change, possibly requiring further stretching of the timeline. At the same time, from a price perspective, the worst seems to be behind us, and any significant pullback would present a buying opportunity. In the best case, there might be another chance to see prices in the range of 54,000 USD to 55,000 USD. However, we do not expect Bitcoin to fall much lower for now. The chances are increasingly leaning towards the upside.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4723727-bitcoin-not-yet-ready-to-launch-the-breakout-rally-crypto-btc?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/34046608.jpeg

The charges, the first brought against a blockchain platform, may signal a precedent for how the Gambling Commission plans to deal with Web3 companies in the future.  Sorare, a fantasy sports company, was charged with providing unlicensed gambling facilities in the U.K. in the Gambling Commission's first action against a blockchain-based platform.  The company, based in Saint-Mande, France, operates fantasy soccer, basketball and baseball games that allow participants to buy and sell collectible cards using non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It has inked deals with the English Premier League and Germany's Bundesliga, among other national sporting associations. NFTs are unique digital tokens used to represent assets.  ""Sorare is charged with providing facilities for gambling without holding an operating licence,"" the commission said on its website. The company will have to appear on Oct. 4 in Birmingham Magistrates’ Court.  The charges follow an almost three-year inquiry by the regulator. In 2021 the commission said it was looking into whether Sorare needed a gambling license. The case is the first time it has clamped down on the use of a blockchain-based platform and the outcome could set a precedent for how regulators handle Web3 firms in the future.  It is also another sign suggesting U.K. regulators are taking more enforcement action against suspected illicit activity in the crypto space following a swoop on unregulated crypto ATM's.  ""We firmly deny any claims that Sorare is a gambling product under U.K. laws,"" a Sorare spokesperson said.

With the potential to capture a significant share of the market, some speculate that Solana could eventually surpass Ethereum in market capitalization, a concept known as the “flippening.” Although institutional adoption has been slower for Solana compared to Ethereum, its upcoming upgrades, such as Firedancer, could further enhance its scalability and performance.

Nonetheless, Solana’s potential to dominate the Web3 space remains significant as it continues to grow and gain users. In a Climate Dominated by EVM Chains & Solidity, Does Solana Have What it Takes? Solana has emerged as a formidable contender in the race for dominance in Web3, with its fast, scalable, and low-cost infrastructure positioning it as a potential competitor to Ethereum. Its unique Proof of History (PoH) consensus mechanism enables the network to process over 2,600 transactions per second (TPS), a significant advantage over Ethereum’s 15 TPS. This enhanced speed and efficiency, combined with drastically lower transaction fees, has attracted developers and users alike, leading to a rapid expansion of Solana’s ecosystem. With metrics such as daily active users and transaction volumes already surpassing Ethereum, some speculate that Solana could eventually challenge Ethereum’s dominance, sparking discussions about a possible “ flippening ” where Solana overtakes Ethereum in market capitalization. Institutional adoption has been a key factor in Ethereum’s sustained leadership, but Solana is beginning to gain traction in this area as well. Although institutions have been slower to embrace Solana compared to retail investors, its performance metrics and technological innovations are drawing more attention. VanEck’s recently published analysis suggests that Solana could reach 50% of Ethereum’s market cap in the near future, driven by the blockchain’s ability to handle high-frequency Decentralised Applications (DApps) with minimal cost. However, institutional reluctance to move away from the established Ethereum ecosystem may delay this shift, as Ethereum continues to benefit from its first-mover advantage and deeper integration into the Decentralised Finance (DeFi) landscape. Solana’s edge in transaction efficiency could play a crucial role in capturing Web3 development and usage. With lower fees and faster execution times, Solana provides a more attractive environment for developers building DApps, especially those requiring high throughput like gaming and real-time financial applications. Ethereum’s high gas fees and network congestion have pushed many developers to explore alternatives, and Solana’s technical strengths make it an ideal candidate. Upcoming upgrades such as Firedancer , expected to further improve Solana’s speed and scalability, may solidify its position as a go-to platform for Web3 applications, offering a competitive advantage over Ethereum. Despite its strengths, Solana faces challenges, particularly around centralization concerns due to the higher costs associated with running a node. Critics argue that Solana’s smaller validator set makes the network more prone to outages and less decentralised than Ethereum. However, as Solana continues to innovate and attract a growing user base, its potential to capture a significant portion of the Web3 space remains undeniable. Whether Solana will ultimately surpass Ethereum depends on its ability to address these concerns while continuing to deliver superior performance and cost-efficiency, but the possibility of a “flippening” reflects the shifting dynamics in the blockchain landscape. Discuss the Solana vs. Ethereum debate in our Discord! Will Ethereum’s Upcoming Improvements Level the Playing Field? Ethereum’s upcoming upgrades, particularly those focused on scalability and throughput, such as Danksharding and the continued development of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, are expected to bring significant improvements to the network. Danksharding, which will split the blockchain into smaller, more manageable parts, aims to increase Ethereum’s transaction throughput and reduce gas fees by distributing the load across multiple shards. Additionally, Ethereum’s Layer 2 rollups, including solutions like Arbitrum and Optimism , are already making progress by offloading transactions from the main Ethereum chain and providing cheaper, faster alternatives. These L2 solutions are essential to Ethereum’s roadmap and are intended to improve scalability without compromising security or decentralisation. However, the challenge for Ethereum is whether these upgrades can be implemented quickly enough to keep pace with Solana’s rapid growth and high performance. Solana already processes over 2,600 TPS, dwarfing Ethereum’s current throughput. While Ethereum’s upgrades may eventually bring it closer to these performance levels, Solana’s current infrastructure already offers a competitive edge for high-frequency DApps and scalable Web3 use cases. Moreover, Solana’s transaction fees are a fraction of Ethereum’s, which could make it more appealing for developers looking for cost-effective solutions in the short term. One of the key differences between Ethereum and Solana lies in their approach to scalability. While Ethereum relies heavily on its Layer 2 ecosystem and sharding to improve performance, Solana has designed its base layer for high throughput and low fees from the outset. This gives Solana an inherent advantage, as it does not require additional layers or complex solutions to achieve scalability. The Firedancer upgrade, expected to further improve Solana’s performance by increasing its capacity to handle up to 1 million TPS, underlines Solana’s position as a highly scalable network built for the future of Web3. In the long term, Ethereum’s deep-rooted developer community and robust DeFi ecosystem will likely continue to give it a strong presence in the Web3 space. However, unless Ethereum can quickly roll out its scalability improvements and lower fees to a competitive level, Solana may continue to capture a growing share of the market. For performance-intensive use cases like gaming, NFTs, and DeFi applications, Solana’s architecture is currently better positioned to deliver the scalability and low fees needed to succeed, making it a formidable competitor to Ethereum as the race for Web3 dominance intensifies. What Could Solana Flipping Ethereum Look Like? Solana’s rapid growth in transaction speed, user activity, and lower fees has positioned it as a formidable competitor to Ethereum, particularly in high-frequency Web3 use cases. Solana offers a significant performance advantage, particularly in areas like DeFi and Non-Fungible Tokens NFTs. As Ethereum continues to face scalability challenges despite ongoing upgrades like sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Solana’s superior infrastructure makes it a strong candidate for capturing a larger share of the Web3 market. Despite Solana’s superior technical performance in many key metrics, Ethereum still maintains a dominant position in terms of market capitalisation and institutional adoption. Ethereum’s long-standing reputation as the primary smart contract platform gives it a first-mover advantage, particularly with established DApps like Uniswap and OpenSea. However, as Solana continues to outperform Ethereum in terms of daily active users and transaction volume, it is possible that the market cap gap between the two could narrow. Currently, Solana’s market cap is only 22% of Ethereum’s, but with continued growth and adoption, analysts at VanEck speculate that Solana could reach 50% of Ethereum’s value in the coming years. For Solana to overtake Ethereum entirely, it would require not only sustained growth but also increased institutional trust and capital rotation. While retail users have quickly adopted Solana due to its low fees and fast transaction speeds, institutional investors have been slower to shift capital from Ethereum, largely due to Ethereum’s established infrastructure and familiarity. However, as Solana’s Firedancer upgrade, set to launch in 2025, promises to further enhance performance by enabling up to 1 million TPS, the network could become increasingly attractive to larger players. If Solana can capitalise on this growth, the “flippening”, where Solana surpasses Ethereum in market cap, could become more than just speculative theory. While Ethereum is working to address its scalability issues, the pace of its upgrades may not be fast enough to match Solana’s aggressive trajectory. With Ethereum focused on complex solutions like sharding and Layer 2 rollups, Solana’s single-layer architecture provides immediate advantages for developers and users alike. If Solana continues on its current path, it could solidify its position as the go-to blockchain for high-performance Web3 applications, potentially surpassing Ethereum’s market dominance in the next few years if Ethereum’s upgrades fail to deliver in time.

Upon Confirmation, DOT May Target… pic.twitter.com/1JpVUM0oHJ — World Of Charts (@WorldOfCharts1) September 25, 2024 As long as the bigger crypto market starts to revive, this prediction does not seem unreasonable because Polkadot is important for blockchain interoperability and has the potential to attract renewed investor attention. Falling Wedge: Bullish Reversal Pattern Among the most consistent technical indications for identifying reversals is the falling wedge formation. The token has been moving in two downward-sloping trends, therefore decreasing the price range. The trajectory normally points to a declining bearish attitude; as the negative momentum fades, the likelihood of a breakout to the upside is more intense. For Polkadot, the trend has been developing over several months indicating that the token might be getting ready for a significant price ascent. Added to this is the relative strength index, another familiar momentum indicator, that has recently made higher lows even as the price of DOT has trended lower. Price and momentum divergence, which always indicates decreasing selling pressure, suggests bulls are about to reclaim control. The technical setup favors a rally despite expected volatility. Price Growth Potential And Market Sentiment Given that the token has increased 13% over the past week and shows a remarkable 2.47% growth just in the last 24 hours, Polkadot’s present market mood is rather positive. These increases show a growing demand for DOT even if more general market conditions are yet unknown. Currently trading at $4.92, the cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of $7.51 billion and a minor increase in trading volume. The optimistic projection for the next years is even more motivating. Should DOT breach its wedge formation, experts think the price may move toward the $12 resistance level. Reaching that would be a major turn from the current decline in the token and would create conditions for even further increases in the next months. Polkadot: Long-Term Projections Looking ahead, Polkadot’s development promise seems even more remarkable. In six months, CoinCheckup projects a 311% price growth; over the next year, it forecasts a more impressive 425% climb. These figures fit Polkadot’s continuous network changes, including new alliances and its emphasis on increasing its cross-chain capacity.

42390317,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMLe1,1727440500,Bitcoin Prices Show Positive 30-Day Correlation With China's Central Bank Balance Sheet,"Bitcoin's price has been positively correlated with the size of the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) balance sheet over the past eight years.  The PBOC is considering a massive stimulus of up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) to bolster its economy, leading to a surge in Asian stock markets, including a notable rise in the CSI 300 Index.  Some say this stimulus could indirectly benefit bitcoin by potentially increasing investments in blockchain and crypto-related ventures.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} prices seem to have tracked the growth in the Chinese central bank's balance sheet over the past eight years, maintaining a notable positive 30-day correlation.  The People's Bank of China (PBOC), holds roughly $6.22 trillion worth of U.S. dollars on its balance sheet. At press time, the 30-day correlation coefficient between bitcoin's price and the PBOC's balance sheet size was 0.66, according to data source TradingView. Its always been positive except 2016 and from late 2022 to 2023. On the other hand, as of writing, bitcoin had a -0.88 correlation over 30 days with the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, the lowest on record since 2016.  A strong correlation means a co-efficient of 0.6-0.9, and 0.8-1 is considered a very strong correlation. Correlations are a statistical measure of how two variables are related and can be used in financial markets to predict or track asset prices.  The positive correlation is noteworthy as early this week, the PBOC said it was considering injecting up to 1 trillion yuan ($142 billion) of capital into its biggest state banks to increase their capacity to support the struggling economy.  The central bank also cut the reserve requirement ratio for mainland banks by 50 basis points (bps) while lowering the seven-day reverse repo rate – the interest rate at which a central bank borrows funds from commercial banks – by 20 bps to 1.5%.  BTC has gained nearly 3% this week and is up over 10% for the month, according to CoinDesk data. Asian stocks led by China have also surged in the wake of PBOC's stimulus bazooka. The CSI 300 Index of large-cap shares soared 4.5% on Friday, bringing this week’s gain to 16% in the biggest run since 2008.  Like the U.S., China's stimulus aims to lower unemployment and spur business growth. The new inflow of cash could indirectly push up the price of Bitcoin, particularly from a long-term perspective, market analyst Nick Ruck told CoinDesk in a Telegram message on Friday.  “The stimulus could lead to increased investment in blockchain companies that may include mining technology and startups,” Ruck said. “Select funds may also be able to increase exposure to crypto-related investments offshore, such as in stock-listed firms and ETFs in Hong Kong.”  The bump won’t be limited to bitcoin, some say, as all riskier assets are expected to get a boost in the coming months.  “It’s all the green light for global risk markets as U.S. equities hit new ATHs for the 3rd time this week, helped by a rapid-fire of furious stimulus to resuscitate the long-struggling Chinese economy,” Augustine Fan, head of insights at SOFA, told CoinDesk. “This has led macro observers to turn explicitly bullish on all risk assets in the interim, with a seemingly globally synchronized easing move that was reminiscent of the easy-money days from the QE era.”  “Naturally, crypto prices are still highly correlated to equity performance. However, investor sentiment seems to have flipped to a ‘buy the dip’ mode, and risk-reward favors a continued rally with no or little downside catalysts in sight,” Fan added.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Shaurya Malwa, James Van Straten",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/27/bitcoin-prices-show-positive-30-day-correlation-with-chinas-central-bank-balance-sheet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f76e0157ad8743a89f4b2cff2cfca9e1f1b4b33-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34043504,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644944,1727440233,MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Bet Pays Off In Multiple Ways As Stock Surges 317%,"MicroStrategy was shot into the limelight when it began publicly buying Bitcoin back in 2020. While it is not the only publicly listed company to do this, the company’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy set it apart from the rest. Four years later, MicroStrategy is now the public company with the largest BTC holdings in the world, recording over $5 billion in profit so far. However, the profit on the BTC holdings is not the only positive that has come from the company’s Bitcoin investment strategy. MicroStrategy’s Stock Price Blows Up MicroStrategy’s MSTR stock price has completed an incredibly successful year that has seen it perform the big hitters in the stock market. A year ago, the MSTR stock price was sitting at a low of $45. However, as the Bitcoin price recovered and the company’s BTC portfolio grew, so did the company’s stock price. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts What Will Drive The Ethereum Price Back Above $3,000 Again In only one year, the price surged more than 317% to reach a new all-time high of $192 back in March 2024, according to data from TradingView. This put it above its previous February 2000 peak of $139, making it its highest level in more than two decades. Interestingly, the surge to the $192 all-time high in March coincided with the the Bitcoin all-tine high of $73,750 in the same month. This suggests that the MicroStrategy stock price is closely correlated with the Bitcoin price performance. It’s understandable given that Bitcoin has become the company’s largest holdings, meaning that as the Bitcoin price rises, so does the valuation of the company, translating to an increase in the stock price. Currently sitting at $167 at the time of this writing, meaning it’s 16% down from its $192 all-time high. However, it is still 250% higher than its $45 price level a year ago. This puts it ahead of the likes of Apple which is up only 24% year to date and Amazon, with a 34% year-to-date increase. Even NVIDIA’s outstanding performance falls behind MicroStrategy, with a 155% year-to-date increase. Padding Up With Bitcoin Despite being four years in, MicroStrategy is not letting up on its Bitcoin purchases, with major purchases this year. In 2024 alone, the company has bought 63,079 BTC which cost around $4.04 billion to acquire. The most recent purchase was on September 20, when former CEO Michael Saylor announced that the company had purchased 7,420 BTC for $489 million. This has brought the company’s total BTC holdings to 252,200 for a whopping cost price of $9.9 billion. Related Reading: Dogecoin Eyes Bullish 50% Rally To $0.16, But Will A Crash Come First? Despite the already massive Bitcoin holding, accounting for more than 1.166% of the total supply, MicroStrategy plans to continue buying BTC. The company announced it was offering $700 million in convertible notes, which was later amended to $1 billion, the proceeds of which would be used to purchase more BTC. As for the company’s plan for its massive BTC stash, Saylor has previously revealed that the company has no plans of selling soon. For now, the plan looks to be to buy as much BTC as possible to hold as a treasury asset.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 2,090.20 +1.76% Bitcoin (BTC): $65,567.06 +1.8% Ether (ETH): $2,649.73 +0.83% S&P 500: 5,745.37 +0.4% Gold: $2,666.73 -0.22% Nikkei 225: 39,829.56 +2.32%  Top Stories  Bitcoin closed in on a return to $66,000, climbing to its highest point since the start of August. BTC rose to over $65,900 during mid-morning in Europe, an increase of over 3% in the previous 24 hours. Bitcoin then retreated to trade just above $65,500. Spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. enjoyed a monster day on Thursday, registering inflows of $365 million and bringing the weekly total to over $600 million. The broader digital asset market, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index, is also higher by around 1.8%, with dogecoin leading the gains. DOGE jumped around 9% to nearly $0.125 amid a surge in memecoin prices.  China's plans for a huge stimulus package lit a fire under memecoins, with both SHIB and FLOKI registering double-digit gains. Memecoin prices tend to respond positively to liquidity injections because the increased availability of cash nurtures a greater appetite for risk among traders. Memecoins are community-driven and jump when the market displays risk-on behavior. ""Leading the gains are the SOL and BTC ecosystems, indicating a strong focus on meme coins as overall liquidity grows. While not nearly as explosive as meme coins on the aforementioned chains, meme coins on Ethereum, such as $PEPE and $SHIB, are also experiencing heightened interest from the market,"" HashKey OTC CEO Li Liang said.  TIA, the token of data-availability network Celestia, posted its best monthly gain this year, confounding traders who'd positioned for a drop in the price as the result of a $1.13 billion token unlock due next month. September's market-beating 40% surge takes place against a background of some market participants seeking downside hedges due to concerns the token unlock due Oct. 31, equivalent to 16% of its total supply, will flood the market and depress prices. However, the bias for shorts, likely stemming from the hedging activity, might have led to a short squeeze, contributing to the TIA rally. ""Traders tried to sell ahead of the [unlock] event from Julyish. I'd argue the squeeze has already happened,"" Jake Ostovskis, an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the dollar value locked in the number of active XRP call and put options on Deribit.  At $18.7 million, open interest in calls is at least five times greater than in put options, a sign of bias for bullish bets.

Render Has Enjoyed Bullish Momentum Over The Past Week The cryptocurrency sector as a whole has witnessed an uplift recently, but Render has been among the altcoins that have really stood out from the rest. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have only seen weekly profits of around 3% and 9%, respectively, RENDER has shown an impressive 23% jump. Related Reading: Dogecoin Wins Over Major Demand Zone: Path To $0.15 Now Clear? The below chart shows how the recent performance of the asset has been like. Following this sharp growth, Render’s price has now neared the $6.5 mark for the first time in four weeks. In terms of the market cap, the asset has seen its valuation touch $3.3 billion, placing it at the 29th place on the top cryptocurrencies list. The coin is now chasing Pepe (PEPE), which is the 28th largest asset in the sector with a market cap of around $3.9 billion. Though, considering the 18% difference in their valuations, it wouldn’t be an easy task for RENDER, especially since PEPE generally shows a notable rise of its own when the market goes up. As for what could be behind the latest growth that the cryptocurrency has enjoyed, perhaps on-chain data can provide some hints. Sharks & Whales Have Been Busy Buying The Token Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, the Render sharks and whales have participated in some considerable accumulation during the last eleven weeks. The indicator of relevance here is the “Supply Distribution,” which tells us about the amount of supply that a given wallet group on the network is holding right now. In the context of the current topic, the cohort containing addresses who own at least 100,000 tokens is of interest. At the current price of the coin, this cutoff is equivalent to just under $650,000, which is a significant amount. As such, this group corresponds to the large hands of the market, popularly known as the sharks and whales. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm, which shows how the Supply Distribution for these investors carrying 100,000+ coins has changed over the last few months: From the graph, it’s apparent that the supply held by the Render sharks and whales has witnessed a considerable increase over the last eleven or so weeks. More specifically, these investors have added 20.54 million tokens to their wallets, equivalent to 3.7% of the total supply.

42390307,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMKoj,1727434800,"GraFun, Supported by Floki and DWF Labs, Brings Memecoin Frenzy to BNB Chain","GraFun, a new memecoin launchpad and trading platform on the BNB Chain, is set to launch on September 27, 2024, at 11 am UTC. It introduces a ""Fair Curve"" mechanism aimed at promoting fair launches and long-term investment in memecoins.  GraFun has garnered support from significant players in the crypto ecosystem, including Floki, BNB Chain, DeXe Protocol, HOT Protocol, and strategic partnership with DWF Labs.  Floki will own 40% of GraFun, expecting to leverage this to enhance its influence in the BNB Chain memecoin market - boosting the project’s fundamentals.  The memecoin issuing and trading frenzy that gripped Solana and Tron blockchains in the past few months could soon see a repeat on the BNB Chain ecosystem, thanks to a protocol that says it is making the process easier and better for users.  GraFun, a memecoin launchpad and trading platform exclusive to the BNB Chain network, will be released on September 27 at 11:00 UTC.  It uses a unique bonding curve mechanism that allows anyone to fairly launch a memecoin for next to nothing. This is similar to Solana’s runaway hit Pump Fun, but GraFun’s developers say they have made certain key improvements.  “It's all about promoting long-term investment and real growth,” GraFun developers explained in an X post. “Unlike the traditional bonding curve, the Fair Curve is community-first. And built to benefit everyone who participates. It gives you the power to be part of a DAO — where decisions are made by you and your fellow token holders.”  The project has bagged support from crypto ecosystem project Floki and other industry heavyweights including BNB Chain, DeXe Protocol, and HOT Protocol. DWF Labs is also a strategic partner.  “Floki is the biggest memecoin brand on the BNB chain by far, and our role in helping with its recent launch and ensuring its success has shown the kind of sway Floki holds within the BNB ecosystem and in this space as a whole,” Floki developer B told CoinDesk in a message.  “With Floki’s backing, GraFun will send a strong message to the industry that it is the de facto platform for creating fair launch memecoins in the space,” B added.  Floki will receive 40% ownership of GraFun and get 40% of the revenue generated from the launchpad. Floki’s ownership of GraFun will lead to key benefits for FLOKI and its sister project TokenFi (TOKEN), developers told CoinDesk in a release.  What is bonding curve model?  With the bonding curve model, anyone can deploy a memecoin or a launchpad that supports this model for next to nothing (e.g., anyone can create a memecoin with GraFun with a few dollars or less), with zero developer experience and without having to make any form of commitment (liquidity, expensive token deployment costs, etc).  The memecoin launchpad then allows the market to determine the value of the memecoin: if there is enough demand to push the memecoin to a certain market cap (e.g., $100,000 market cap), it hits a “bonding curve,” and liquidity is automatically added to a decentralized exchange (DEX) and burned or locked - making it possible for anyone to buy the memecoin on DEXs.  If a memecoin does not hit the bonding curve, it simply does not get “launched” on a DEX. The memecoin launchpad makes money regardless.  The most popular examples of memecoin launchpads that use this kind of model are Pump on Solana - which pioneered such a model - and Tron’s Sun Pump.  Pump.fun has made over $110 million in fees in the last 6 months alone and is currently projected to generate $136.5 million in annual fees. SunPump has made $5.2 million in fees since launching a little over a month ago and is currently projected to generate $51.8 million in annual fees.  However, the massive amount of tokens launched on Pump and Sun means most tokens fail to reach a bonding curve and end up in losses - leaving a majority of users unhappy in the past months. As CoinDesk previously reported, Pump's quick token creation services mean tens of thousands of tokens have likely been issued since its March launch. However, only a few have reached more than $10 million in market capitalization.  GraFun’s USP is the “Fair Curve” model, which developers say minimizes rug-pull risks, reduces price manipulation, and ensures fairer token issuances that result in fewer users losing money.",POSITIVE,BNB,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | SOL | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/09/27/grafun-supported-by-floki-and-dwf-labs-brings-memecoin-frenzy-to-bnb-chain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/04708226a905d2d21ad69209274869bf3a3f5bd3-1280x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34039625,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644888,1727431254,"Ethereum: Analyst Sets $2,820 As ETH’s Next Key Level to Watch, Here’s Why","Following the market’s recent pump, the leading cryptocurrencies have seen a remarkable performance. Bitcoin is trading above the $64,000 mark, while Ethereum (ETH) has surged 9% in the last week to consolidate above a key support level. Despite the bullish sentiment, some crypto investors remain cautious about ETH’s performance as the second-largest cryptocurrency faces the next crucial resistance level. Related Reading: Memecoin Sensation Popcat Hits New All-Time High After Surge To $1 Ethereum Consolidates Above $2,600 Ethereum recorded a 13% price jump in the last seven days after the US Federal Reserve (Fed) announced its decision to cut the interest rate by 50 basis points (bps). The bullish momentum propelled the ETH’s price to ranges not seen in a month, triggering a positive sentiment among many investors. Over the weekend, the “King of Altcoins” surged from the $2,300 support zone to the $2,500 mark before reclaiming the $2,600 resistance level as the week started. Since then, the cryptocurrency has hovered between the $2,600-$2,684 price range, momentarily dropping below the key support level on Wednesday afternoon. Nonetheless, Ethereum has faced resistance today after recovering from the recent drop to $2,500. Market analyst Crypto Yapper noted that ETH had been “running into critical resistance on the Daily chart,” as it had been unable to break successfully above the $2,650 mark since Tuesday. This performance worried some investors, who considered that not breaking above this level could hinder the cryptocurrency’s run and send the price toward the previous support zones. However, Ethereum’s price jumped 1% in the last hour to trade above $2,650. As of this writing, ETH exchnges hands at $2,660, recording a 2.1% and 9.3% price increase in the daily and weekly timeframes. ETH To Reach New Highs In October? Crypto Trader Daan highlighted that Ethereum’s price made a higher low (HL) but has not been able to make a higher high (HH) yet. The trader noted that an HH would occur above the $2,820 mark, which was lost over a month ago, and it would signify a trend reversal for the cryptocurrency. This level corresponds with the horizontal level that kickstarted the February-March run to $4,090 after the breakout. Additionally, it coincides with the Daily 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) around that area, which makes it “an important level to watch.” A breakout above this mark could further propel ETH’s price toward the $3,000 resistance level. Julien Bittel, Head of Macro Research at Global Macro Investor (GMI), noted that Ethereum’s chart is “looking a lot like a 2023 redux.” Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Reclaims Top 10 Crypto Spot, Analysts Set New Targets Per the Chart, the cryptocurrency’s current market structure resembles its 2023 movements very closely. A repeat of ETH’s previous bullish trajectory suggests that ETH’s price is about to break out and hit a new all-time high (ATH) mid to late October. Additionally, the chart shows that if it follows the same bullish trend, Ethereum’s price has the potential to reach somewhere between the $10,000 to $20,000 targets by Q1 2025, which would represent a 669% surge from its current price and a 300% jump from its ATH.

42390367,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMMJ3,1727430660,BlackRock Highlights Bitcoin’s Unique Properties as Approved IBIT Options Could Cement Risk-Off Status,"Bitcoin is up 22% since the Yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, while gold and the S&P 500 are up around 11%.  Over 65% of the circulating bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for over a year.  Almost all holders are in profit if they held for three years, while they are all in profit if they held for at least five years - Unchained.  BlackRock released a report last week, titled ""bitcoin as a unique diversifier.""  The investment giant identified four key points from the report. First, how to analyze bitcoin {{BTC}} in relation to traditional financial assets due to its fundamental properties, such as not having a quarterly earnings report or a CEO.  Second, bitcoin's high volatility can be perceived as a ""risky"" asset, which contributes to the discussion that whether it is a ""risk-on"" or ""risk-off"" asset. The token could be considered a flight-to-safety option because it is scarce, non-sovereign, and decentralized. Lastly, BlackRock pointed out that the long-term adoption of bitcoin may come from global instability.  Bitcoin's realized volatility trends downwards  Bitcoin's realized volatility continues to trend downwards over time, indicating increased stability. In the early years of bitcoin, its realized volatility used to trade over 200%; however, as the asset matured, so did the volatility.  Since 2018, realized volatility has not exceeded 100% and is currently at 50%. As realized volatility decreases and liquidity increases through financial instruments such as the spot and futures market, this may bring in more sophisticated investors such as options traders. This seems to be on the horizon with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of physically settled options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin ETF.  Risk-on or risk-off?  BlackRock also asked the question: Is bitcoin risk-on or risk-off? While short-term trading may suggest that bitcoin behaves like a risk-on asset, the data reveals a different narrative over a longer time horizon.  According to data from bitcoin custody service Unchained, ""almost all holders (99%+) are in profit if they held for just three years. All bitcoin holders in this class are in profit if they held for at least 5 years"".  We can see this type of mentality on-chain among investors, where over 65% of the circulating bitcoin supply has remained unmoved for more than one year, according to Glassnode. This trend suggests that many investors tend to hold bitcoin because they believe in its store-of-value narrative and view it as a risk-off asset, even though bitcoin has faced multiple 20% corrections in 2024.  Low historical correlation with U.S equities  BlackRock also showed that bitcoin has a very low correlation to U.S. equities. A graph shows the trailing 6-month S&P 500 correlation with bitcoin; the average correlation is 0.2 since 2015. Sometimes, assets will trade near one-to-one with one another due to external macro factors, most likely in risk-off or liquidity events.  The report notes, ""These episodes have been short-term in nature and have failed to produce a clear long-term statistically significant correlation relationship.""  Bitcoin outperforms other risk-on assets after major events  Continuing with the theme of having a long-term time preference, BlackRock noted that bitcoin tends to outperform other risk-on assets after 60 days following a major geopolitical event.  The U.S.- Iran escalation in 2020 saw bitcoin return 20% after 60 days, outperforming gold and S&P 500. This was also the case for Covid-19, the 2020 U.S. election challenges, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. regional banking crisis, and most recently, the Yen Carry trade unwind on Aug. 5.  During the recent Yen carry trade unwind on Aug. 5, which was now 53 days ago, major assets experienced declines on the day. However, bitcoin has risen by 22% since then, with gold and the S&P 500 up roughly 11%.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/09/27/blackrock-highlights-bitcoins-unique-properties-believes-btc-is-risk-off-in-the-long-term,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba4839935ebba3c51df79b9098c8d253caa62cfa-1388x830.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The six-month corrective trend in altcoins seems to have ended.  Earlier this week, analysts at the Bitfinex crypto exchange said August's $65,200 high is the level to beat for bitcoin {{BTC}} bulls.  The breakout happened Thursday and how. Bitcoin jumped over 3%, the most in nine days, to the highest since July 31 with a wider trading range than Tuesday, according to charting platform TradingView.  In other words, the cryptocurrency formed a bullish ""outside day"" pattern, signaling an end of the recent consolidation below $65,000 and a resumption of the rally from lows under $53,000.  ""The outside day can form midway in a price trend, just like flags and pennants. Since outside days act as continuation patterns, expect the breakout to be in the same direction as the inbound price trend,"" investor and technical analysis expert Thomas N. Bulkowski wrote in his book ""Encyclopedia of Chart Patterns.""  The breakout flipped the August high into a support level, shifting focus to the next resistance closer to $70,000. The resistance is identified by the trendline connecting highs registered in March and June.  Bitcoin has gained almost 1% so far on Friday, close to $66,000, validating the bullish breakout. The positive bias would be invalidated if prices fell below Thursday's low of $62,805.  Altcoin breakout  While bitcoin is still stuck in a broad descending channel, the cumulative market capitalization of alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), or tokens other than market leaders bitcoin and ether, has broken out of a six-month corrective trend.

CZ was sentenced to four months in prison in April after pleading guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy Act by failing to set up an adequate know-your-customer (KYC) program at Binance.

The stablecoin has been described as the first “Bitcoin-backed, yield-bearing” synthetic dollar available on the retail market.

Introducing institutional investors will push the platform to develop at a faster pace. With the final step in activating the Nakamoto upgrade, several SX users have released posts regarding the benefits of the network upgrade. All in all, the conclusion is the same: the Nakamoto upgrade will significantly improve user experience while simultaneously allowing developers to access the $1 trillion in liquidity under Bitcoin, with sBTC, a 1-to-1 Bitcoin-backed asset in Stacks, integrated with Solana and Aptos for quicker distribution and adoption. Investors Should Watch Stacks On These Levels STX retains some of its momentum, breaking any short term possibility of a reversal as it breaks through $2.02 in the short term. This price action nets the bulls some serious gains, but this triumph might only be temporary as the bulls lose momentum to maintain a steady trajectory. The relative strength index (RSI) of the token suggests that the bulls may encounter a wall around $2.2 in the short term, possibly letting the bears gain strength equaling the current bullishness. A movement like this will keep the token’s price stable, possibly giving the bulls enough time and room to maneuver upwards in the medium term. Related Reading: Popcat Climbs By 35% – $1 Target Within Reach If STX remains at its current support level of $2.02, we might see a surge upward in the coming days; that’s if the the pullback the market is currently experiencing to flip bullish.

42390319,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bcMLoH,1727423908,Celestia's TIA Posts Biggest Monthly Gain This Year Even as Impending $1.13B Token Unlock Spurs Hedging,"TIA has outperformed the CoinDesk 20 Index this month by a large margin.  There has been an increase in TIA hedging demand ahead of a Oct. 30 token unlock, Wintermute said.  Bearish short positions, likely representing hedging, have been crowded out, funding rates suggest.  TIA, the token of data-availability blockchain network Celestia, posted its best monthly gain this year, outperforming the broader market by a significant margin and confounding traders who'd positioned for a drop in the price as the result of a $1.13 billion token unlock due next month.  The market-beating 40% surge, the biggest since December 2023, contrasts with a 13% gain in the CoinDesk 20 Index, a measure of the largest, most liquid cryptocurrencies. It takes place against a background of some market participants seeking downside hedges due to concerns the massive token unlock due Oct. 30 will flood the market and depress prices.  Next month's unlock will release 175.74 million TIA. That's 16% of the cryptocurrency's total supply and worth $1.13 billion, or 82% of the market capitalization, according to data source CryptoRank. Such large unlocks often create bearish pressures in the market.  ""There has been an uptick in TIA hedging demand ahead of the Oct. 30 unlock – both via exchange-traded perpetuals, alongside OTC forward agreements with market makers/trading desks,"" Jake Ostovskis, an over-the-counter trader at Wintermute, told CoinDesk in a Telegram chat.  Short squeeze  The bias for shorts, likely stemming from the hedging activity, might have led to a ""short squeeze,"" contributing to the TIA rally. A short squeeze happens when the asset price remains resilient, contrary to expectations, forcing bears to close their positions, which are bets that an asset will drop. That, in turn, puts upward pressure on prices.  ""Traders tried to sell ahead of the [unlock] event from Julyish. I'd argue the squeeze has already happened,"" Ostovskis said.  That's evident from the recovery in funding rates tied to TIA perpetuals, which have rebounded to nearly zero, or neutral, having been in negative territory since July. As suggested by Ostovskis, rates below zero are a sign of traders taking bearish bets to protect against the downside price risk posed by the influx of so many tokens.  The recovery to neutral alongside the TIA price rally suggests shorts have been crowded out and might have inadvertently squeezed the price higher.  The $100 million fundraise  A $100 million fundraise announced this week likely gave bears another solid reason to exit shorts, adding upward momentum. The fresh round raised the foundation's cash stash to $155 million, although the team did not detail how it plans to use the funds.

34035753,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644812,1727422206,Altcoin Market Cap Surges Past 200-Day EMA: Is Altseason Finally Here?,"Several indicators point to renewed strength in altcoins, suggesting a potential altcoin season on the horizon. However, for confirmation, Bitcoin (BTC) dominance needs to drop further. Altcoin Market Cap Crosses 200-Day EMA Crypto analysts are closely monitoring various indicators that track altcoin behavior, with one critical metric being the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA). Related Reading: Ethereum Gains On Bitcoin Following Fed Rate Cut: Altseason Soon? According to the following chart, the OTHERS index – an index that tracks the market cap of cryptocurrencies excluding the top 10 digital assets by market capitalization – has surged past both the 100-day EMA and the 200-day EMA. For the uninitiated, the 200-day EMA is a commonly used technical indicator that shows the average price of an asset over the past 200 days, with more weightage given to recent prices. It’s used to identify long-term trends – when the price is above the 200-day EMA, it suggests the asset may be in an upward trend, while being below it signals a potential downtrend. At present, the OTHERS index sits at $227.5 billion, while the 200-day EMA and the 100-day EMA are at $221.8 billion and $212.9 billion, respectively. According to crypto analyst Caleb Franzen, the last time this occurred was in July 2023. At the time, altcoins established firm support at these EMAs to achieve higher-highs. Another cryptocurrency analyst, Ali Martinez, alluded to the altcoin market cap – excluding BTC and Ethereum (ETH) – breaking out of what appears to be a long downward trend. Although Martinez is not fully convinced of a full-blown altcoin season yet, he dubs the breakout as a “good start.” Bitcoin Dominance Must Crash Before Altseason While the altcoin market cap breaking out of a sustained downtrend raises hope for an imminent altseason, BTC dominance (BTC.D) must drop significantly from its current levels. Related Reading: Altcoins About To Take Over? Analyst Suggests Time To Accumulate Will End Soon Currently, Bitcoin dominance sits at 57.5%. From the chart below, it is evident that BTC.D has been on a sustained upward trajectory since at least November 2022. According to crypto analyst Yoddha, BTC.D looks poised to crash into the mid-40s, potentially paving the way for a full-blown altseason. Negentropic, co-founder at on-chain data platform Glassnode, remarked that the market seems to be on the verge of an altcoin season. Referring to the Bitcoin-Altcoin Cycle chart from Swissblock, Negentropic notes that once BTC breaks its all-time high (ATH) and enters price discovery mode, altcoin should follow suit. The Bitcoin-Altcoin Cycle chart displays the inverse relationship between BTC and altcoin price movements throughout the year. Any reading above 50 indicates the market has entered an altcoin-dominated phase, whereas a reading below 50 signals a BTC-led market. Despite these promising indicators, it’s important for the leading altcoin, ETH, to rebound against BTC before capital flows into mid-cap and small-cap altcoins. As previously reported, the ETH/BTC trading pair is currently at its lowest since April 2021. At press time, BTC trades at $64,481, up 1.5% in the past 24 hours.

Given its election season, Gensler refused to reveal his view on Donald Trump's plan to have a bitcoin strategic reserve for the U.S.  ""Not liking the rules is not the same as that there aren't rules,"" he said insisting that current laws give the SEC the power to oversee the crypto space.  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler reiterated his stance that bitcoin {{BTC}} is ""not a security"" but doubled down on his stated position that regulatory clarity exists for the crypto space in an interview with CNBC on Thursday.  ""As it relates to bitcoin, my predecessor and I have said, that's not a security,"" Gensler said. ""You now have a way that you can actually express that view — buy into that through exchange-traded products."" Such products were approved by the SEC in January, marking a monumental shift in the agency's approach to the crypto space.  Gensler was responding to CNBC's Joe Kernen asking whether the SEC chair was ""warming up to top-tier crypto?""  ""Where are you on what's called altcoins, there's 15 or 20 thousand of them. Where are you Joe?"" Gensler asked.  Gensler refused to reveal a position on what he thought about Donald Trump's idea ""to keep the current government holdings ""as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.""  ""I have a view but given my role and also we are in election season so for the listening public I will stick to my chalk lines which are securities markets and chairman Powell and others can speak to that.""  Apart from bitcoin, Gensler has maintained that the vast majority of other tokens fit the legal definition of securities that are rightfully under the SEC's jurisdiction. This position remains despite industry push back, lawsuits against the SEC and a recent hammering the SEC got for two hours during a congressional hearing titled ""Dazed and Confused: Breaking Down the SEC’s Politicized Approach to Digital Asset.""  Asked by CNBC if the SEC had been regulating by litigation, Gensler once again argued that current laws give his agency the power to oversee the crypto space.  ""Not liking the rules is not the same as that there aren't rules.”  Gensler also said that he didn't know where bitcoin will be in 20 years but that that he felt ""the field is going to have a challenge building trust"" which it is ""already"" when ""there's so many fraudsters, scammers.""  ""Look at the leading lights in this field, in the crypto field just two years ago. A number of them are in jail right now, and I'm not just talking about SBF... there's been tens of billions of dollars of losses and bankruptcies and so forth,"" Gensler said on Thursday.

Conflux's CFX saw an 18% rise following news of liquidity injection by the People's Bank of China, with traders focusing on assets perceived as 'China beta' like CFX, dubbed the 'Chinese Ethereum', especially after its new support for stablecoins.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} rose by 3%, trading above $65K with U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs seeing one of their largest inflow days at $365 million, predominantly into ARK's ARKB, while Ethereum (ETH) experienced minor outflows but still gained 4% over the week.  Friday's market in Asia went to the memes as Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Bonk (BONK) posted double-digit gains and Conflux's CFX was up over 18% as the market digests the recent liquidity injection from China's central bank.  ""After the initial rally in alts that took center stage last week, the market seemed to have been in rotation mode for this week,"" Rick Maeda, Research Analyst at Presto Research wrote in a note to CoinDesk.  ""Within this series of rotations in search of the next narrative that explored verticals such as AI and memecoins, the China stimulus news from Tuesday made traders focus on coins perceived to be China beta, such as $CFX and $PHB which have both outperformed,"" Maeda continued. ""It remains to be seen if this is a new regime here to stay or the market grasping for a narrative-based trade.""  HashKey OTC CEO Li Liang pointed to improving funding rates as a sign of market recovery.  ""Leading the gains are the SOL and BTC ecosystems, indicating a strong focus on meme coins as overall liquidity grows. While not nearly as explosive as meme coins on the aforementioned chains, meme coins on Ethereum, such as $PEPE and $SHIB, are also experiencing heightened interest from the market,"" he said.  Aside from the liquidity-induced market moves because of the perception that Conflux is the 'Chinese Ethereum', traders are also looking favorably on a recent announcement that the protocol has launched support for stablecoins through a partnership with WUSD.  While WUSD is a relatively small stablecoin (its issuer is registered as a trust in Hong Kong) there has been a recent run of stablecoin-related announcements with new products coming out from Ethena labs (UStb) and BitGo (USDS) which the market is looking favorably upon.  Dog memes lead market  Risk appetite returned after months with dog-themed memecoins leading gains in the broader crypto market. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Floki (FLOKI) zoomed as much as 15%, while Solana-based bonk (BONK) led sector gains at 17%.  Some lesser-known dog-themed tokens based on the lesser-used Bitcoin Runes protocol also rose, indicating investors were ready to take more riskier bets.  Memecoins are heavily community-driven and jump when the market displays risk-on behavior. These create value through community engagement, humor, and shared cultural references - and tokens inspired by dogs, cats or frog surge based on what’s more trending in social circles.  ETFs continue positive inflow run  Elsewhere in crypto, bitcoin {{BTC}} is up 3% as it continues to trade above $65K.  U.S. spot bitcoin ETFs had a monster day of inflows with $365 million, according to SoSoValue, making it one of the largest days on record and bringing the weekly inflow to over $600 million.  Most of the day's inflow was focused on ARK's ARKB ETF at $113.8 million, followed by BlackRock's IBIT at $93.38 million, and Fidelity's FBTC at $74 million.  ETH ETFs didn't have the same market interest, as they saw outflows of nearly $675,000.  Ether {{ETH}} is up 4% in the last week, according to market data, versus 2% for BTC.

Despite the market experiencing a slight pullback today, WLD surged 31% since last week, representing a huge jump in value as the protocol continues to expand its services. Worldcoin’s identity-proving technology continues to expand. Just this week, several developments continue to arouse curiosity in the minds of retail investors. If the trend keeps up with the market’s seemingly continuous bullishness, WLD will cover ground in the long term. Related Reading: Popcat Climbs By 35% – $1 Target Within Reach Worldcoin Services Expand To Three New Countries In a blog post, Worldcoin’s World ID services were announced to be available in three new countries: Guatemala, Poland, and Malaysia. The decision was made against the backdrop of the surprisingly quick advancement of artificial intelligence technology and its possible use in fraud worldwide. Wordlcoin’s proactive technology concerning individual privacy in the world aims to combat this providing a decentralized way to check someone’s identity using the platform’s novel proof-of-personhood approach which is detailed in their whitepaper. In Guatemala alone, majority of the population have a growing need to know whether the thing they’re communicating with is either human or a bot. According to Worldcoin, 83% of the country desires to know whether the content they’re viewing was made by AI, 84% is concerned with the fast advancement in AI technology making it harder for them to discern humans from bots, and 88% support technologies that check whether the “person” they’re interacting with is a human or a bot. With the growing need for AI in every facet of a person’s daily life, Worldcoin’s technology might have a place in keeping individual privacy safe. Beginning September 25, orbs, physical locations where people can verify their identity, will become available in Guatemala. As of now, no word of further deployment in Poland, but the World ID service has been announced on Malaysia earlier this week.

34033485,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644875,1727416818,Bitcoin’s Liquidation Data Signals a Possible Trend Reversal—Here’s Why,"Bitcoin price movements and market sentiment have often been tied to the positions held by traders across the board. Regarding that, an insight shared by CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha sheds light on the potential significance of Bitcoin’s long/short liquidation delta, hinting at a shift in market stance. This indicator, according to the shared insight provides a deep dive into how the balance between long and short positions can often foreshadow significant price corrections or rallies. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation With Gold Now At Highest Level Since March Bitcoin Liquidation Suggest Imminent Market Shift Taha’s analysis centers around Bitcoin’s delta value, which is derived from comparing long versus short liquidations. In simple terms, if the delta is positive, there is a larger proportion of long positions, whereas a negative delta implies dominance by short positions. By examining the spikes in this delta, Taha identifies crucial points where notable liquidation events occurred, suggesting market sentiment shifts and potential corrections. According to Taha’s observations, a particularly significant event occurred when Bitcoin’s price was hovering around $63.8,000. At this point, the delta value indicated a substantial liquidation of short positions, exceeding roughly -$664 million. The analyst notes that such a sharp spike in short liquidations may indicate a shift in market sentiment. In other words, the sudden liquidation of short positions might have forced retail investors to close their positions at unfavorable prices. Historically, these notable liquidation events tend to cause sharp changes in market direction. A significant influx of liquidated long or short positions can either reinforce or reverse a price trend, driven by the sentiment of traders who may be compelled to exit their positions under pressure. Taha’s analysis suggests that the sizable liquidation of short positions during Bitcoin’s upward trajectory hints at a broader correction phase, signaling that the asset’s price may face volatility and potentially adjust downward before any clear direction is established. Detailing The Implications Of The Liquidation Delta To further understand the implications of the long/short liquidation delta, it is worth grasping the role of leverage trading within the crypto market. Notably, traders often take leveraged positions to maximize potential returns, but this also comes with heightened risks. When the market moves against their positions, liquidations can occur rapidly, leading to amplified price movements. In the case of Bitcoin, the spike in liquidated short positions at $63.8K suggests that a wave of traders holding short bets were squeezed out, potentially adding upward momentum to Bitcoin’s price movement. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Sees Dip: Is the Uptrend Still Safe?

SOL price is rising and might aim for a fresh increase above the $158 resistance zone. SOL price started a fresh increase above the $150 zone against the US Dollar. The price is now trading above $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $150 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could again gain bullish momentum if it clears the $158 resistance zone. Solana Price Eyes More Upsides Solana price extended its increase above the $150 resistance like Bitcoin and Ethereum. SOL even climbed above $155 before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $1582 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $156 and $155 levels. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $146 swing low to the $158 high. However, the bulls were active near the $154 support zone. Solana is now trading above $152 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $150 on the hourly chart of the SOL/USD pair. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $146 swing low to the $158 high. On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $158 level. The next major resistance is near the $162 level. A successful close above the $158 and $162 resistance levels could set the pace for another steady increase. The next key resistance is near $174. Any more gains might send the price toward the $180 level. More Downsides in SOL? If SOL fails to rise above the $158 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $153 level. The first major support is near the $150 level. A break below the $150 level might send the price toward the $145 zone. If there is a close below the $145 support, the price could decline toward the $138 support in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.

U.S. authorities also seized websites associated with three illicit cryptocurrency exchanges.  Russian nationals Sergey Ivanov and Timur Shakhmametov have been charged for their involvement in operating money laundering services that catered to cybercriminals using cryptocurrencies, U.S. authorities announced on Thursday.  The U.S. Department of State has announced rewards amounting to $10 million each for information leading to the arrests of Shakhmametov and Ivanov.  U.S. authorities also seized websites associated with three illicit cryptocurrency exchanges, in what was termed a ""coordinated international effort"" involving authorities in the Netherlands, Latvia, Germany, U.K, Europol, and multiple U.S. agencies. The websites relate to Russia linked payment and exchange platforms Cryptex.net, UAPS, PinPays, and PM2BTC.  A statement from U.S. President Joe Biden on U.S. support for Ukraine said ""To counter Russian sanctions evasion and money laundering, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Treasury, and the U.S. Secret Service have taken action today to disrupt a global cryptocurrency network, in coordination with international partners.""  Ivanov conducted transactions worth over $1.15 billion in value in the past 11 years. He was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud for providing payment processing support to the carding website Rescator and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering for carding website Joker’s Stash. The unlawful use of stolen credit and debit card data for fraudulent purposes is known as ""carding.""  Shakhmametov, known online as “JokerStash” and “Vega,"" was charged with the same offences as Ivanov, but he also faces one count of conspiracy to commit access device fraud for his role in operating the carding website Joker’s Stash, which offered for sale data from 40 million payment cards annually.  “The two Russian nationals charged today allegedly pocketed millions of dollars from prolific money laundering and fueled a network of cyber criminals around the world, with Ivanov allegedly facilitating darknet drug traffickers and ransomware operators,"" said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco.  The operation involving the U.S. Secret Service saw the seizure of two website domain names used to support the cryptocurrency money laundering exchange “Cryptex.net,” where ""37,500 transactions"" amounting to $1.4 billion were made.

34032042,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644694,1727413242,Dogecoin Wins Over Major Demand Zone: Path To $0.15 Now Clear?,"An analyst has pointed out how Dogecoin has reclaimed a major on-chain demand zone, which could open up the path to higher levels. Dogecoin May Not Have Much On-Chain Resistance At Upcoming Levels In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about how DOGE has just overcome a major on-chain supply wall. On-chain supply ‘walls’ refer to price ranges that carry the cost basis of a significant amount of investors. Below is the chart from IntoTheBlock shared by the analyst, which shows how the different Dogecoin price ranges are currently looking in terms of this. In the graph, the size of the dot corresponds to the amount of DOGE that the addresses on the network last purchased between the corresponding price levels. The $0.108 to $0.111 range particularly stands out as it has a huge dot attached to it at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Correlation With Gold Now At Highest Level Since March More specifically, the range contains the cost basis of around 62,270 addresses who bought a total of 36.08 billion tokens of the memecoin at levels situated inside it. To any investor, their cost basis or acquisition level is naturally special, due to which they can be prone to showing some kind of reaction when a retest of it takes place. Dogecoin retesting a range where only a few investors bought wouldn’t produce any significant reaction, but in the case of a major demand zone, like the $0.108 to $0.111 range mentioned earlier, holders may make enough simultaneous moves so as to cause fluctuations in the coin’s value. As for how exactly traders might react to a retest of their cost basis comes down to investor psychology. Retests of investors who were previously in loss can lead to a selling reaction, as these holders might fear the price will go down again in the future and thus, could decide to exit at their break-even, to at least get their investment back in full. Earlier, Dogecoin’s spot price had performed a retest of the $0.108 to $0.111 range from below, but it appears the resistance from these sellers wasn’t enough to hold back the meme coin as it has shot up above it with a sharp jump during the last 24 hours. From the chart, it’s apparent that unlike this latest range, DOGE has just surpassed, the levels ahead are relatively thin in terms of supply. “If DOGE holds this level, it could confirm a bullish breakout,” notes Martinez. “With no major supply walls in sight, the path to $0.150 looks clear!” Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Top At $400,000 Based On This Model, Analyst Says A potential run to this $0.150 mark from the current Dogecoin price would mean an increase of more than 31% for the memecoin. It now remains to be seen if the asset continues its rally in the coming days and whether it would be able to reach this level or not. DOGE Price At the time of writing, Dogecoin is floating around $0.114, up more than 9% over the last seven days.

The price is now testing the $0.5840 support and might continue to consolidate. XRP price is still struggling to clear the $0.600 resistance zone. The price is now trading below $0.5920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $0.5920 and $0.600 resistance levels. XRP Price Stuck Below $0.60 XRP price attempted another increase (like Bitcoin and Ethereum) above the $0.5850 and $0.5880 resistance levels. It even spiked above $0.5920, but the bears were active near the $0.5960 level. A high was formed at $0.5961 and the price started a downside correction. There was a move below the $0.5920 and $0.5880 levels. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5744 swing low to the $0.5961 high. The price is now trading below $0.5920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5880 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.5880 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The first major resistance is near the $0.5920 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5960. A clear move above the $0.5960 resistance might send the price toward the $0.600 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.6050 resistance or even $0.6120 in the near term. More Losses? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5880 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5820 level. The next major support is near the $0.5800 level and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.5744 swing low to the $0.5961 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5800 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5740 support in the near term. The next major support sits at $0.5650. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

34030566,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644924,1727409629,Analyst Warns Of A ‘Super Signal’ For Cardano (ADA): Could It Outperform Bitcoin?,"Cardano (ADA) has recently recorded impressive gains of nearly 13% over the past week, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Analysts are optimistic about further price increases for ADA, particularly following the emergence of a “super signal” on the ADA/BTC trading chart. Cardano Price Tests Key Levels Market expert TrendRider highlighted this potential in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), noting that the super signal indicates a strong possibility for ADA to gain value against Bitcoin in the upcoming weeks. This signal carries historical significance, boasting an 80% accuracy rate whenever it has appeared, suggesting that further price gains for Cardano are not just hopeful speculation but grounded in past performance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Peaks At Highest Value In 2 Months Above $65,000: Bull Run Predictions Currently trading at $0.398, ADA is at a critical juncture, testing the 21-day exponential moving average (EMA). TrendRider emphasizes that if Cardano manages to close the week above this level, it could signal the continuation of an upward trend. Following this, the price is expected to encounter volatility around the $0.430 mark, where the 50-day EMA is situated, and again at $0.490, which aligns with the 100 and 200-day moving averages. However, according to TrendRider’s analysis, the ultimate target for Cardano could be the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.75, which would be a significant milestone for the token following the significant price declines it has experienced over the past month. Market Analyst Predicts “Up Only” Phase Further reinforcing the bullish outlook, market analyst Alexander Legolas recently asserted that the crypto market has entered an “up only” phase. This optimism extends not only to Cardano but also to other prominent altcoins, which have shown signs of recovery following two notable market corrections of over 20% each on August 5 and September 6. During these downturns, the Cardano price fell to $0.27 and $0.303 respectively, marking significant lows for the 2024 token after hitting its annual high of $0.810 earlier this year during the Q1 rally, which also saw BTC hit its all-time high of $73,700. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Q4 Outlook Indicates Parabolic Move Toward $120,000 Legolas further predicts that ADA could experience substantial upward momentum in the coming months, particularly as liquidity increases in the altcoin market. He points to the recent breakout of the total3 Alt chart from a massive cup and handle pattern as a key indicator of positive market sentiment. If these predictions come true, Cardano could even approach the $1 mark, a rise of around 151% from current levels. However, the token would still be down 67% from its all-time high of $3.09 reached during the 2021 bull run.

34029093,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644703,1727406053,"Historical Trends Put Bitcoin At $400,000 With Shocking Timeline","Based on historical trend patterns, a crypto analyst has forecasted that Bitcoin could hit a staggering peak of $400,000. This ambitious price target would require Bitcoin to jump over 6X its current price, marking a historical milestone, as the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization would surpass $7 trillion. Bitcoin Power Law Points To $400,000 Increase Bitcoin’s price dynamics have been hinting at a potential bullish surge, as the cryptocurrency has steadily maintained a price above crucial resistance levels around $60,000. According to Crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the broader crypto market sentiment shifted to “Greed” again following Bitcoin’s recent price surge to $64,750. Given Bitcoin’s market movements, Martinez has maintained an optimistic outlook for the cryptocurrency. He disclosed in a recent X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin could see its price potentially skyrocketing to $400,000 if the Bitcoin power law holds true. The Bitcoin power law is a mathematical relationship between Bitcoin’s price and time. This law predicts that the price of Bitcoin will rise to $100,000 between 2021 and 2028, with a firm assurance that in 2028, the cryptocurrency’s value will never drop below $100,000. Additionally, the law also forecasts that Bitcoin’s price will hit $1 million per coin sometime between 2018 and 2037, establishing that after 2037 the price will never fall below $1 million. In his post, Martinez revealed that his projected $400,000 price leap would mark the cryptocurrency’s next market top, surpassing its current March all-time high of above $73,000 by approximately 440%. He has based this ambitious price projection on not just the long-term Bitcoin power law but also on historical market trends. Martinez presented a historical price chart of Bitcoin dating back to 2011, forecasting that the timeline for this projected $400,000 price surge could occur in 2025. The analyst also identified three crucial price levels for Bitcoin: $392,532 price mark as a resistance level, with support identified at $37,146 and linear regression fit around $104,693. While a few crypto members see Martinez’s $400,000 Bitcoin projection in a positive light, others have remained skeptical, either doubting the possibility of such a dramatic surge or suggesting that a price increase between $160,000 and $200,000 was a more realistic target. BTC To Leave Bearish Trends Behind The price of Bitcoin has been on a steady upward momentum over the past few weeks. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bitcoin rose above $64,000 this week, marking a 2.88% increase in its price. Given the cryptocurrency’s recent price surges, crypto analyst, Jelle has declared that Bitcoin’s market structure is inches away from leaving a bearish trend and completely turning bullish. He revealed that the pioneer cryptocurrency is already locked in two higher lows and is coming close to achieving a higher high as well. As a result of these developments, Jelle has predicted that the $65,000 price mark was a key resistance level to break, indicating a potential rally to new highs thereafter.

34026891,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=644798,1727400604,"Pendle Foundation, BitMEX Co-Founder Moving PENDLE To Binance—What’s Going On?","PENDLE, the native token of Pendle, a real-world asset (RWA) tokenization platform, may be steady at press time. However, looking at CoinMarketCap data, the token is up 130X from its November 2022 lows and 41% from all-time highs registered in 2024. Whales Sending Tokens To Binance As prices cool off, there are emerging concerns. According to trackers, the Pendle Foundation, tasked with promoting the RWA platform, has been offloading tokens. At the same time, Arthur Hayes, the co-founder of BitMEX, one of the first crypto perpetual trading platforms, is selling. Related Reading: Here Is Why The Bitcoin Bull Run Hasn’t Started, According To Analyst Specifically, over the last three weeks, a big chunk of PENDLE transfers have been moved to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, a net negative for sentiment. On September 16, the foundation’s governance wallet moved 600,000 PENDLE worth over $2.4 million to Binance. Over the past year, the wallet has moved 3.72 million PENDLE worth over $11.95 million to Binance. Meanwhile, Spot on Chain has also picked out transfers from Hayes. On September 24, the BitMEX co-founder deposited 240,000 PENDLE worth over $958,000 to Binance. Over the last four days, Hayes has moved more than $6.5 million of the token to Binance. Hayes is one of the PENDLE whales. Although there is no direct proof that the former BitMEX executive has been selling, moving tokens to Binance could signal his intention to sell. Currently, Hayes owns over 253,00 PENDLE worth nearly $990,000. This holding represents around 4% of his overall crypto portfolio. PENDLE Up 100% From August Lows, Will Whales HODL? Despite the exchange transfers, the token continues to shake off Q3 2024 weaknesses. Buyers are back in the equation after sinking to as low as $1.7 in early August. Related Reading: BlackRock Continues To Buy Bitcoin: Holdings Now Reach 358,000 BTC Worth $22 Billion At press time, the token is up 100% from August lows, and buyers are bent on reclaiming the April 2024 highs at around $7.2. For the uptrend to remain, buyers must hold steady above $3.5, or August highs, and sustain the current upside momentum. Looking at the daily chart, bull bars are banding along the upper BB–a volatility indicator–suggesting that the underlying momentum is strong. If buyers build on this, PENDLE could register fresh all-time highs, incentivizing more whales to HODL. Currently, CoinMarketCap data shows that over 58% of all tokens in circulation is held by whales.

After last week’s interest rate cut, optimism has surged among analysts and investors, with many anticipating strong upward momentum for the altcoin. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Consolidates in Symmetrical Triangle – Analyst Reveals $160 Target On Breakout This positive sentiment is reflected in spot trading and the futures market, where key data from Coinglass reveals a bullish inclination. The key market sentiment indicator of the funding rate suggests that traders are positioning themselves for a potential breakout. If Cardano breaks past its current resistance, a 20% surge is expected, potentially pushing the price to levels not seen in months. This breakout could solidify the altcoin’s uptrend and set the stage for further gains. As the price approaches this critical resistance, investors are closely watching for signs of increased volume and momentum, which would confirm the strength of the bullish trend. With market sentiment shifting and technical indicators aligning, Cardano appears poised for a significant move. Cardano On-Chain Metrics Suggest A Breakout Cardano has surged over 15% since last week’s interest rate cut announcement, fueling speculation of a potential altseason in the crypto market this year. The broader market is turning optimistic, and key data from Coinglass supports this sentiment, showing a positive funding rate of 0.01%. This rate indicates that traders are paying a premium to maintain long positions, reflecting their anticipation of a potential price rally for ADA. A positive funding rate generally suggests a bullish market outlook, as it shows that traders are willing to incur additional costs to hold onto their positions, expecting further price appreciation. As Cardano approaches its crucial resistance level at $0.40, market sentiment points towards a potential breakout. Should the price maintain its current momentum and break above this key resistance, analysts expect an aggressive surge to new highs. Related Reading: SUI Price Sits 40% Below All-Time High As TVL Approaches $1 Billion Investors are closely watching this level, as a successful breakout could lead to a rapid 25% rally towards the $0.50 mark. This scenario would mark a significant recovery for ADA and reinforce the growing belief that altcoins, led by Cardano, could outperform in the coming weeks. However, the market remains cautious. While the current sentiment and data suggest a bullish outlook, the price must sustain its upward momentum to validate these predictions. A failure to break past the $0.40 resistance could result in a period of consolidation or even a short-term retracement. As the crypto community eagerly anticipates ADA’s next move, the coming days will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can capitalize on this renewed optimism and kickstart a broader altcoin rally. ADA Price Action: Key Levels To Watch ADA is now trading at $0.39, hovering around a key resistance level that hasn’t been broken since late July. The price is less than 5% away from the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.41. This EMA has acted as a significant resistance level since mid-April and now aligns with a crucial supply zone, making it a pivotal point for continuing Cardano’s bullish momentum. For the bulls to gain momentum and establish a stronger uptrend, ADA must reclaim the 200 EMA and decisively break past the $0.40 resistance. Doing so would signal a confirmation of a daily uptrend and could pave the way for a sustained rally to higher price levels. Related Reading: XRP $0.60 Triangle Breakout Could Ignite Parabolic Rally – Key Levels To Watch However, a deeper correction could follow if ADA fails to break through current resistance and set a new high. A pullback to lower demand levels around $0.35 would be the likely scenario as traders seek support before any potential rebound. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can break through this resistance and establish a more bullish trajectory or if a retracement is imminent.
