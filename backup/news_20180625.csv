42429231,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLws3h,1529963402,$3 Billion: FTC Warns Consumers Could Pay High Price for Crypto Scams,"Consumers lost $532 million to cryptocurrency-related scams in the first two months of 2018, an official for the Federal Trade Commission said Monday.  Speaking during an event focused on cryptocurrency scams and fraud, Andrew Smith, director of the trade watchdog's Bureau of Consumer Protection, offered the figure and said that the figure could swell into the billions by the end of the year.  ""Consumers will lose more than $3 billion by the end of 2018,"" he told attendees of the event, which was live-cast on Monday.  One part of the problem is a lack of care on the part of investors. This was an issue highlighted by Joe Rotunda, enforcement director for the Texas State Securities Board. And it's an especially acute one set against the backdrop of a huge rise – and subsequent fall – in the value of cryptocurrencies over the past six months.  Coin Center director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh said that people get sucked into fraud – from exit scams to pump-and-dump schemes – simply because they're looking to see a higher return on their investment.  ""I think nobody should ever buy any more cryptocurrency, put anymore [into] cryptocurrency than what they are completely willing to lose … if you are willing to participate at all,"" Van Valkenburgh remarked, adding:  ""That is a message that needs to be repeated and repeated.""  Rotunda said he believes that ""regulators need to be proactive in any type of new market, especially this type. We didn't have the public being pitched different types of investments like this on the scale a year ago. This is something that blew up late last year.""  ""Regulators need to number one, identify companies that are trying to do it right and work with [them],"" he remarked. ""The companies that are trying to do it right [should] get a telephone call from the regulator, not a cease-and-desist order, right? Not a lawsuit. We can usually work with them ... [and] we need to identify the fraudulent schemes and we need to act quickly and stop them.""  As might be expected, the event also saw calls for approaches to self-regulation, an idea that has seen advancement from both public and private sources in recent months.  Yet in the end, the discussion fell to a common recommendation: investors should do their due diligence.  ""If you yourself are not capable of explaining to somebody what a token's supposed to do, you should not buy the token,"" said Van Valkenburgh. ""If you can't tell the wheat from the chaff, or what is techno-gibberish or actual innovation, you should not participate.""

The fund, as explained in a blog posthttps://a16zcrypto.com/2018/06/introducing-a16z-crypto/ published Monday, will be named ""a16z"" and will notably feature former federal prosecutor and Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Haun as one of its co-leads. Haun has also been named as the firm's latest general partner.  That the investment firm would move to vastly expand the scope of its activities in the industry is unsurprising, given the millions it has poured into projects and protocols built around a range of use cases. Andreessen Horowitz has also invested in a number of notable startups, including crypto exchange Coinbase.  General partner Chris Dixon indicated in the post that the crypto-fund would take a decidedly long-term tack in its investments.  ""We've been investing in crypto assets for 5+ years,"" he wrote. ""We've never sold any of those investments, and don't plan to any time soon. We structured the a16z crypto fund to be able to hold investments for 10+ years.""  Dixon went on to add:  ""We plan to invest consistently over time, regardless of market conditions. If there is another 'crypto winter,' we'll keep investing aggressively.""  In another hint at the fund's overall thesis, Dixon said that a16z would focus its efforts on projects with a ""non-speculative use case.""  ""We want services powered by crypto protocols to be used by hundreds of millions and eventually billions of people,"" Dixon wrote.

Although Monday was intended to serve as an ""Independence Day"" celebration marking both the official launch of its mainnet and the completion of its departure from its former host, ethereum, the project has only achieved the former.  More precisely, founder Justin Sun said during a live stream that Tron is still in the process of migrating the last of its users' TRX tokens from ethereum to its mainnet.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, Tron started its token swap last week, indicating at the time that the swap would be complete by ""Independence Day"" in order for token-holders to be able to use their TRX to vote for 27 block validators on Tuesday.  Dubbed ""super representatives,"" these validators compete to produce blocks as part of the project's delegated proof-of-stake system (DPoS). However, Sun has now suggested that the initial timeline is no longer realistic.  ""We expect to finish all the exchange token swap and the migration in the next couple of days,"" Sun said.  He added that Tron has ""already served"" one-third of the exchanges supporting the swap, and that upon the completion of the remaining two-thirds, users will be able to withdraw their tokens from the exchanges.  Pushing ahead  Nonetheless, Sun said Tron intends to proceed with its super representative election tomorrow, though he suggested that it could extend for several days.  ""Probably this election period will go five days or something, because lots of the [token holders] need time to get their mainnet tokens,"" he said during the livestream. Each super representative must garner 100 million votes or more to be elected, and each TRX token constitutes one vote.  While Sun's statement suggests that some users will have to wait to vote, project representatives said during its livestream that token holders can complete and observe the voting and election processes via its Tron Scan feature.  The portal – which tracks information about blocks, transactions, nodes and other components of the blockchain – reveals that Tron has produced more than 10,000 transaction blocks on its network thus far and boasts almost 400 nodes. This information was also confirmed by Sun at the conclusion of the livestream.  According to Tron, the conclusion of the election will mark the start of community governance over the blockchain, which it calls ""the ultimate phase of an independent Tron.""

42429227,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrth,1529946936,Pharma Giant Merck Eyes Blockchain for Fighting Counterfeit Meds,"Pharmaceuticals giant Merck is seeking a patent for a way to use blockchain in order to track goods as they move through the supply chain.  Published last Thursday and submitted in December 2016, the patent application outlines a method by which a blockchain could be used to store information about a physical object – in this case, a single product – and receive updates as it moves onward from its point of origin. That distributed network could then be used to store information verifying the authenticity of the item.  In other words, the main point here is anti-counterfeiting. Merck already maintains internal processes for eliminating fake goods that move through its systems, and the proposed patent seems as if it would fit into those wider efforts.  Merck notes in its filing that the technology ""enables a secure, reliable storage of the reading results with very high data integrity, such that it is essentially impossible to manipulate or erase or otherwise taper [sic] with or lose such data, e.g. due to unintended or deliberate deletion or due to data corruption.""  The pharmaceuritcals firm goes on to explain:  ""Furthermore, the stored information can be accessed wherever access to the blockchain is available. This allows for a safe and distributed storage and access to the stored reading results, e.g. for integrity verification purposes such as checking whether a supplier of a product being marked with a composite security marking, as described herein, was in fact the originator of the product, or not.""  Whether Merck will move to ""put pills on the blockchain"" remains to be seen, but the company has pursued a number of initiatives to date within the technology space.

The China Electronic Information Industry Development (CCID) Blockchain Research Institute – which aims to provide an independent rating system for the blockchain space – has placed the just-launched EOS network in the number one spot, with ethereum and NEO coming second and third, respectively. The release is the second since the index launched in May  Notably, bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was rated outside the top 10 in 17th place – a drop from 13th in the last list, following a change in the ranking methods.  However, the project sets out to gauge 30 major blockchains based on their technological capabilities and use cases, not aspects related to their financial valuation. According to the index's website, the purpose of the list is to ""evaluate the development level of global public-owned chain technology, accurately grasp the trend of blockchain.""  The placement of EOS in the top slot may be seen as somewhat controversial, however, since the project went live as recently as June 14 and almost immediately encountered issues with transactionshttps://hacked.com/eos-mainnet-grinds-to-a-halt-post-launch-as-transactions-freeze-unexpectedly/ that forced developers to make a hasty fix.  Just days prior to launch, EOS had also seen serious bugs raised by a Chinese internet security firm that required urgent patches to be issued. The report said that loopholes in EOS' code could expose nodes to attackers, giving them the ability to possibly take ""full control"" of transactions.  In its assessment, the CCID blockchain research team gave EOS 102 points for fundamental technology, 15.4 for applicability and 44.1 for innovation. Meanwhile, ethereum – a platform noted for its smart contract functionality – scored lower on fundamental technology (85.2), but higher on applicability (24.9).  The team wrote about the number one-placed blockchain:  ""Because of its potential to support commercial distributed applications, [EOS] is considered by the industry to be a typical representative of Blockchain 3.0.""  Bitcoin was rated as low as 41.6 on the fundamental technology scale but, notably, scored relatively well on innovation (35).  Founded in 1995, CCID is the scientific research institute for the MIIT, responsible for technology research and development, policy-making and software testing for a variety of sectors.

42429224,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrnh,1529935203,"Tezos, A Launch Story: What's Left Before the $232 Million Tech Goes Live?","The Tezos Foundation has a message for the community: the code belongs to its users.  Revealed in a statement on Monday, the non-profit is now directly pledging to take steps that will find it less involved in operations once the much-anticipated blockchain is launched. It's a move reminiscent of the recent EOS launch, which has had a rocky start after Block.one, the corporate creator of the blockchain, handed over its tech to its community, and one that could signal a trend as more and more ICO projects go live in 2018.  In the statement, the Tezos Foundation states, ""Tezos' potential rests in the hands of its community, and we have no doubt that the Tezos community is among the strongest and most exceptional in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.""  Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk before the announcement, Ryan Jesperson, the chair of the foundation, went further saying, ""The prior board had considered having a veto power for a year after it launches, but the new board has chosen not to have that power.""  He continued:  ""At the foundation, the way we view our role is to deploy resources to support participants in the community.""  It's a statement on the foundation's realignment with users after months of tension between members of the project's team that ended in February. And while the alphanet for the project has been running for about a year and a half, the Tezos team is looking to launch a blockchain that people can use very soon.  The initial goal was to launch a so-called ""betanet"" of the blockchain by the end of Q2. But with this being the last week of the quarter, that remains to be seen (though Jesperson did elaborate on how the betanet would work).  For instance, the project, which remains one of the largest initial coin offerings in history raising $232 million, will have some oversight initially.  According to Jesperson, when the betanet goes live, users that have completed the recently announced know-your-customer (KYC) process will be able to freely trade the native crypto tokens called tezzies. While the team behind the Tezos project can take the betanet offline at any time for further development or bug fixeshttps://tezosfoundation.ch/news/hackerone-manage-bug-bounty-program-tezos-protocol/, user's transactions will be authentic, meaning that state of the ledger will persist onto the mainnet.  Block producers and bakers  Once Tezos becomes a live blockchain, though, the idea is that it'll be ready to stay up for good and for reliable for entrepreneurs to start using as they explore new ventures.  But with the Tezos development team taking the back seat then, how will decisions be made? In some ways, comparing Tezos to EOS again is helpful here.  Both projects use a delegated proof-of-stake (dPOS) consensus algorithm, which means validation of the blockchain is done by nodes that set aside, or ""stake,"" a certain amount of the protocol's native tokens. Staked tokens aren't lost, but if the node unstakes their tokens to spend, they will lose their position as a validator.  Validators are incentivized for their work, though, as the protocol pays them out in new tokens.  In the case of EOS, the protocol specifically indicates that only 21 validators are needed, and these validators are constantly being swapped in and out based of how other users of the protocol stake their tokens to vote for specific organizations to do the job.  On Tezos, on the other hand, the validator pool is left entirely open. There's no limit to the number of validators, which are called ""bakers"" on Tezos, that can be working for the network, but there is a high bar for becoming one – 10,000 tokens staked.  Users are all encouraged to stake, but if they don't have 10,000 tokens, they can delegate their tokens to other bakers.  When enough users delegate tokens to a baker's stake, that baker should win more opportunities to validate and both parties should end up earning more tokens.  Also similar to what happened for EOS, some companies have already lined up to take on these baker roles ahead of the Tezos launch. Tezos Rocks is a portal for all sorts of information about the protocol, and it shows five different groups that have announced their intention to serve as bakers, asking other token holders to delegate their own tokens to them.  This is far fewer than what EOS had before launch; in EOS' case, dozens of organizations were vying for validator spaces before the launch. And now, there are hundreds trying to work their way into one of the top 21 spots.  The difference may be explained by another key strategic difference in how Tezos was deployed versus EOS.  EOS' ICO ran for about a year and carried out hundreds of short auctions. These auctions also put tokens into investors' hand immediately since EOS launched on ethereum first, using the ERC-20 token as a temporary coin before the EOS blockchain went live and tokens were moved there.  Tezos on the other hand only kept the token sale active for about two weeks and no tokens were handed over at that time.  Without that ebb and flow of token prices live on exchanges, it may have been more challenging for Tezos to build excitement among potential validators ahead of the protocol's launch.  Yet knowledgeable sources have told CoinDesk that more bakers will be announcing themselves after the betanet launch.  The rules of the blockchain  Just as EOS and Tezos have similar deployment processes, the reasoning behind their creation is also akin – they both set out to change blockchain governance.  Indeed, both protocols embrace a central vision that's about putting future decision-making in the hands of users so they can be responsible for building it out from the ground up. The architecture of the two protocols also allows for the rules of the software to change according to the needs of the community at the time.  In a talk at last year's Blockstack Summit, Arthur Breitman, the creator of the Tezos software, said:  ""We have blockchains and blockchains are coordination technology, so let's actually use it for making governance decisions.""  And while governance may not sound that exciting, with the rabid infighting among the different stakeholders of blockchain projects, many wonder if there's a better way to allow various politics to continue without splitting the communities behind the coins.  ""Politics is like weather, it's going to happen no matter what,"" Breitman said in his talk.  And as such, the Beitmans (Arthur created Tezos with his wife Kathleen) set out to hard code that better way.  While it's unclear whether Tezos architecture will lead to less drama, the project's interest in taking the launch process slowly could mean that its launch is less fraught with confusion and misunderstanding than the EOS launch has proven.  EOS launched without finalizing the rules of its system – its ""constitution"" – and as such, several account freezes have happened (some with reason and others without) causing turbulence throughout the community and outside observers.  Contrary to EOS, Tezos will go live with some of the systems' rules in place, but also not nearly as many as what EOS plans to ratify. For example, the Tezos code does not have a statement about violence; instead, all the rules focus on enabling the community to decide on new features, better governance practices and tweaking basic parameters (such as the rate of inflation, rewards to validators, etc).  As such, Tezos focus on technical upgrades seems like a safer place to start, rather than trying to enforce the ""good faith"" of its users. Although, until the blockchain launches, the industry won't know, and many of Tezos investors and also the broader crypto community are waiting with baited breath.  ""The long anticipated wait could end up being a blessing in disguise,"" James Sowers, a Tezos investor told CoinDesk, adding:  ""The blockchain has evolved and they have had more time to learn from the mistakes of others.""  Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the Tezos alphanet was only available to the Tezos team, but it's been available for use by the public since the beginning of 2017.

42429238,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwsDh,1529920834,Bitcoin's Defense of $6K Raises Odds of Relief Rally,"Bitcoin (BTC) is again trading above $6,000 and looking up, but today's closing price will likely set the tone for the rest of the week.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $5,755 at 15:00 UTC on Sunday – the lowest level since Nov. 12 – only to make a quick recovery back above $6,000 an hour later, according to Bitfinex data.  The failure to capitalize on the drop, despite the long-run bearish technical setup, suggests that the bears are feeling exhausted, having pushed BTC lower by more than 40 percent (from $9,990 to $6,000) in the last seven weeks.  So, a relief rally may be in the offing, but that depends on whether prices close today (as per UTC) on a positive note.  At press time, BTC is changing hands at $6,150 – up 4.5 percent on a 24-hour basis.  Daily chart  BTC created a doji candle on Sunday, normally signaling indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of a 40 percent decline from May high of $9,990, Sunday's doji candle likely represents bearish exhaustion.  A notable relief rally could be in the offing if BTC closes today (as per UTC) above $6,250 (Sunday's doji candle high), confirming a bullish doji reversal.  Further, the relative strength index (RSI) has begun to diverge in favor of the bulls: creating a higher low despite a lower low in price. So, a positive price action today would also confirm a bullish divergence there.  A confirmation of bullish doji reversal and bullish price-RSI divergence would improve the odds of a falling channel breakout.  While the short-term outlook stays bearish while BTC is stuck inside the falling channel (bearish pattern), the short duration chart does favor a relief rally in bitcoin.  4-hour chart  The bullish price-RSI divergence only adds credence to Sunday's doji candle and suggests BTC will likely close today above $6,250 today, confirming a bullish doji reversal.  View  A close today (as per UTC) above $6,250 will likely allow BTC to trade on a positive note for the rest of the week. In this case, the falling channel resistance (currently located at $6,800 and seen sloping downwards to $6,600 by Friday) could be put to test.  A high volume falling channel breakout would open the doors to $7,700.  Bearish scenario: An unexpected close (as per UTC) below $6,000 (February low) would open up downside towards $5,090 (rising wedge breakdown target).

It should be noted that the MOU is non-legally binding and the deal is subject to further revision and negotiation.  Publicly traded in Hong Kong, VC Group is a securities brokerage and asset management firm. The firm said in the MOU that the deal is being made through its wholly-owned subsidiary Initial Honor Limited, and comes as part of a wider effort to grow its business by a move into the financial technology industry.  The news comes soon after BTCC itself was acquired by a Hong Kong-based blockchain investment fund in January of this year.  As previously reported by CoinDesk, BTCC – previously called BTC China – was forced to shift its business overseas after the People's Bank of China outlawed initial coin offerings alongside a de facto ban on crypto exchange services.

42429234,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrzh,1529913602,How Commerzbank Is Throwing Out the Business Blockchain Playbook,"With a plethora of business blockchains vying for prominence, banks are under increasing pressure to pick a winner – after all, without network effects, surely the benefits would be lost?  While that might be conventional wisdom, Commerzbank AG, one of Germany's largest financial institutions, is taking a different tack. Rather than choose one protocol on which to build proofs-of-concept, it's chosen five.  It started out a few years ago building on MultiChain, before adding BigChainDB to its development process. Since then it has joined three consortia: Hyperledger, R3 and, as the company revealed this week, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA).  But the strategy is not about building a broad base of knowledge or ""hedging one's bets."" Nor is it about employing a scattershot approach in the assumption that, the more platforms you work on, the more likely it is that you pick the ""right"" one.  Rather, according to the company, it's about a firmly-held belief that the future of blockchains is interconnectivity.  As Paul Kammerer, co-founder of Commerzbank's blockchain lab, told CoinDesk:  ""We strongly believe that there will be not one blockchain solution, there will be a lot of blockchains – the big challenge is that these blockchains talk to each other.""  The advantages of this pluralist approach are likely to become more apparent, given the increasingly interconnected use cases of supply chains, cross-border payments and others, especially as the technology evolves and trials become more collaborative.  For instance, Commerzbank, as one of the largest trade finance houses in Europe, has participated in the development of two trade finance-focused blockchain proofs-of-concept – the Batavia platform based on Hyperledger Fabric and Marco Polo, which is based on R3's Corda.  But rather than see the multi-platform approach as a dilution of its efforts, the bank sees it as future-proofing the investment, as well as an expansion and strengthening of Commerzbank's expertise as it applies to new technologies.  Keeping it close  But this ecumenical approach to blockchain networks isn't the only way in which Commerzbank is further departing from standard enterprise blockchain practice.  In spite of the expense of working on several protocols at the same time, Commerzbank made the decision early on to keep platform development in-house.  Jörg Hessenmüller, head of development and strategy for Commerzbank, explained:  ""It's not enough that we have a bunch of consultants telling us what is the latest in blockchain – we need to have our own skin in the game.""  The company's blockchain lab has 23 developers, up from five a few years ago, and is working on increasing that number, in part to be able to add new protocols to its portfolio.  According to Kammerer, the decision of which platforms to add will depend on the use case. And some of the criteria choose a protocol based on include: its permission restrictions, consensus mechanism, scalability, whether or not it can develop smart contracts, the degree of decentralization and the other players involved the specific use case, he said.  ""There is not one silver bullet blockchain that is good for all future use cases,"" he explained. ""We think of a specific use case, and go for the best blockchain for that.""  Commerzbank normally aims to have 10 active use cases on the go at any given time, Hammerer continued, and the list of blockchains his team is working on reflects those needs.  ""The biggest challenge,"" he said, ""is getting trained on the specific platforms of technology.""  To deepen its knowledge of Corda, for example, the company went as far as embedding developers in the open-source Corda team at R3.  A wider net  While Commerzbank may be a blockchain maverick among banks, it wants to make sure that the technologies it picks will connect it not only with other financial institutions but with enterprises in a variety of sectors someday.  This mission was reflected in its decision to join the EEA. A consortium comprised of more than 500 startups, financial institutions, large corporations, universities, public bodies and even central banks, the EEA was formed in early 2017 to develop standards and other tools for business applications of the ethereum protocol.  Rather than focus on applications for a specific sector, the EEA's objective is to support development and interconnectivity of private versions of one particular blockchain across a wide range of sectors and use cases.  ""While Corda, for example, was built to meet the requirements of the financial services industry, we needed to find further solutions more focused on cross-industry collaborations, like the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance,"" Kammerer explained, adding:  ""We joined to enhance our cross-industry cooperation.""  And that cooperation even extends into the concept of central bank cryptocurrencies – even though the possibility of disintermediation from this technology is generally seen as an existential threat to most commercial banks.  Hessenmüller, however, was candid about his, and more broadly Commerzbank's, openness to the idea.  He believes that central bank money on a blockchain is not only a likely outcome, but a crucial missing ingredient for making blockchain applications more useful for everyone involved.  Speaking to that, Hessenmüller said, ""We need to find a solution that includes money transfer in the ledger, backed and controlled by central banks. This will not happen tomorrow – but several central banks are seriously investigating this topic, and it could be one of the game changers.""

The company filed an application for an initial public offering with the HKEX on Monday, document shows. Since the application is still in draft form, it's unclear at this stage the valuation of the Zhejiang-based company or how much it intends to raise.  The filing confirmed an earlier report from Reuters which indicated in May that the firm was in talks with advisors for the move. According to the report at the time, Ebang was looking to raise as much as $1 billion, which, if true, could be the largest IPO in the cryptocurrency industry.  The filing also comes just a month after Ebang's rival bitcoin miner maker Canaan Creative submitted an IPO application to the HKEX, which was also reportedly aiming to raise $1 billion.  In addition, Ebang's filing today offered fine details on the firm's business operations.  Based on a financial statement included as part of the IPO filing, Ebang raised 925 million yuan ($141 million) in revenue in 2017 alone, marking a 17x year-on-year growth compared with 2016.  Similarly, the firm said in the document it recorded 380 million yuan (or $60 million) in net profit in 2017, which is 34 times more than that in the year before.  Founded in 2010, Ebang Communication started by manufacturing hardware products for the telecommunication industry. The firm later moved into the cryptocurrency mining business by launching its own Ebit miners in 2016 to compete with Chinese bitcoin mining giant Bitmain and Cannan Creative.  Notably, the financial document shows that in 2017, 94.6 percent of Ebang's revenue was generated from the sale of bitcoin miners. That number has also grown significantly from just 31 and 42 percent in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  According to the document, Ebang is also in the process of making its own 7nm bitcoin miners.

42429219,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLwrdh,1529899233,Tron Independence Day: What's at Stake for a $3 Billion Blockchain,"One year and nearly $3 billion later, the Tron blockchain is set to finally put its much-debated technology to the test.  At least, that's what should happen Monday, when Tron completes the token swap it began last week, migrating the last of its users' funds from ethereum to a new proprietary blockchain. For investors, the moment marks a historic ""independence day"" of sorts, but it could more broadly become a make-or-break moment for the project, which though controversial, already finds itself among the top cryptocurrencies globally.  Founded last July, Tron has set out to ""decentralize the internet."" However, the project has yet to rigorously define what this means in practice.  And while Tron's rhetoric may seemingly resemble that of many cryptocurrencies that emerged from 2017's token boom, the project is distinguished by the size of its funding and the outspokenness of its founder, former Ripple representative Justin Sun, who last week caused a stir in the tech world by purchasing the company behind file-sharing service BitTorrent.  Some onlookers speculated that Sun made the acquisition to lend legitimacy to his project - something it has been accused of lacking on more than one occasion.  More specifically, while Tron has positioned itself as a competitor to ethereum and decided to launch its own protocol to address ethereum's ""inefficiencies"", the project was rebuked earlier this year for using code from the protocol without providing an attribution. These allegations were closely followed by claims that project leaders had plagiarized Tron's white paper.  Despite the gravity of these claims, Tron has done little to dispel concerns. On the contrary, the significant alteration of its roadmap, specifically its decision to abandon its original plan to develop on ethereum in favor of creating its own mainnet and its decision to use a delegated proof-of-stake system, further exacerbated them.  For his part, however, Sun remains confident that past allegations are little cause for concern.  He told CoinDesk in an interview that these decisions were necessary to achieve his vision of leading the blockchain industry away from its emphasis on R&D and toward a new focus on user experience and ""consumer-facing products.""  Sun continued:  ""Ethereum is like IBM back in the day, making those big supercomputers. And I'm not saying that ethereum does not have robust technology, but I'm saying that ethereum is just like IBM. They only focus on tech, they don't focus on user experience.""  Sun, on the other hand, is attempting to position his project as the ""Microsoft of the blockchain,"" which he says succeeded ""because they were able to take the computer and make it into a PC, making it into a consumer good.""  Despite the appeal of this vision, Tron has a complex launch ahead and concerns are unlikely to be abated quickly. As with the recent EOS blockchain launch, which saw the $4 billion blockchain go live in an elaborate global process that dragged on for days, Tron will need to navigate similar complexities ahead.  On Tuesday, Tron is expected to follow its token swap with a ""super representative election,"" in which token holders will select the block producer delegates that will approve transactions, after which the technology will finally be live.  'The Frankenstein of crypto'  But launching may be only part of the battle ahead for Tron.  For one, there remain unanswered questions about the strength of its technology. According to Lucas Nuzzi, director of research at Digital Asset Research, which recently analyzed Tron's code, the project may inherit issues from the codebases that its developers have sought to copy.  He told CoinDesk that ethereumJ suffers from issues like memory leakage, a problem related to the buffering of incoming blocks. Further, he explained that he believes these issues could be exacerbated in Tron's protocol because it combines ethereumJ with other relatively new technologies (like the delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism (DPoS) in which various entities compete to act as transaction validators).  Because of this melange of technologies in the Tron protocol, Nuzzi has dubbed the project the ""Frankenstein of crypto.""  ""The project has this history of repurposing technologies and gluing them together and calling it unique,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview. ""When you put all these things together, it is very unlikely that you're not going to encounter severe failures.""  Sun dismissed the allegations of code plagiarism and said the Tron team takes ""security issues very seriously,"" citing as proof the millions of dollars it offers for bug bounties.  He said:  ""Yes, one of our programmers did forget a very small thing that he didn't put on, however, it was so long ago and it was a very minor issue at the time. It's kind of like saying, I'm 27 now and when you were 4 you messed up with this one goal kick. It doesn't really make sense because it's very insignificant in the bigger picture.""  But in interview, Sun couldn't seem to attest to the extent of Tron's use of ethereumJ previously or currently. He initially indicated that Tron previously used ""a small portion"" of ethereumJ and said, ""but it was also six months ago.""  When asked if Tron was no longer using ethereumJ, Sun wavered and eventually said he was unsure and referred CoinDesk to the Tron development team.  The team also failed to provide clarity in an email to CoinDesk:  ""We referenced ethereum's code in our P2P network while keeping all licenses. We have made many changes, optimizing functions like node discovery and node blocking. We've also made some improvements that are more suitable to the Tron DPoS use case...adding functions like [high availability] on the P2P network to prevent unexpected [super representative] disconnections; adding trusted nodes and active nodes.""  According to Nuzzi, these changes are ""very small,"" some being ""the bare minimum changes to support a DPoS system."" Likewise, a search in Tron's code repository for the terms ""ethereum"" and ""ethereumJ"" yields 76 and 73 references, respectively.  Implications for network activation  One practical implication of these technical concerns is that the software is ""unpredictable,"" Nuzzi explained. However, those seeking to leverage the tech appear to be prepared for a bumpy launch.  Dean Zaremba, whose IT networking company Free Space is a Tron super representative candidate, echoed Nuzzi's contention, though for different reasons (super representatives run nodes in the protocol in a bid to earn its rewards).  ""It's a new software being released to the wild, you can only test so much in a testing environment until the public gets their hands on it and you know, tries to crack it in different ways. You just never know.""  Meanwhile, cybersecurity company and super representative candidate Infinity Stone expressed confidence in the Tron project and the amount of testing it has conducted thus far.  ""We are optimistic about Tron... People always keep improving their codebase and in terms of Tron, the good thing is they started their testnet last month. So, some bugs should have been caught already, and they have a dress rehearsal for all the super representative candidates,"" the company told CoinDesk.  For his part, Sun dismissed those who have expressed concerns about the protocol's security as ""random people who didn't really know what they were talking about."" Likewise, he sought to emphasize that the project has carried out ""two rounds of successful rehearsals for the official launch.""  But if the Tron blockchain is merely the first step in Sun's vision of a decentralized internet, he seemed to hint at what that could mean, describing a strategy in which Tron's tech is even ported to other blockchains and beyond.  ""If we are able to successfully launch a voting system and have it be really robust, I really think that bitcoin and ethereum should add a voting mechanism into their governance. Because for me personally,"" he added, ""I'm not just the founder of Tron, I have a lot of ethereum and a lot of bitcoin, and I really want to vote.""  For now, though, it remains to be seen if Sun's project will work, much less spread, or merely cause fireworks.  He concluded:  ""This is just the beginning of the decentralized internet - it's not the end...For right now we don't have a full picture.""

42380945,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX92dw3,1529897490,Ether Price Drops to 10-Week Low Near $400,"The price of ethereum, the world's second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has to a level not seen since April 12.  Data from CoinDesk's price index shows the cryptocurrency dropped by more than $50 over around 12 hours to reach $426.47 around 16:00 UTC on Sunday. Yet the bottom support level sparked an immediate reversal in price, which quickly recovered by $42.  As of press time, ETH is back above $450 but still down 3.36 percent over a 24-hour period. Further, on a year-to-date basis, ETH is reporting a 60 percent decline from this year's high of $1,326 seen on Jan. 14.  However, a swift recovery is in play with the cryptocurrency printing a long consolidation candlestick on the longer-term timeframes, suggesting a reversal from the bottom could be confirmed on the closing day's trade. Long-term indicators suggest ETH has reached the oversold territory and is currently consolidating in price to cool off the RSI and Bearish MACD.  Other major cryptocurrencies are also flashing red, but showing some signs of recovery. For example, bitcoin is trending slightly up at $6,146 based on CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  EOS, the world's fifth largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, tells a similar story: it's down 3.6 percent but has recovered from a low of $6.89 back to $8 as of press time, data from CoinMarketCap shows.  Meanwhile, the total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies is just over $250 billion, the lowest since April 7 of this year.

The plan, if approved, would create a selection process by which Hydro-Quebec will parcel out 500 megawatts worth of power to crypto miners. In a statement last week, the utility said its pitch to the Régie de l'énergie that, if approved, would allow miners to submit bids that Hydro-Quebec would consider based on their ability to create jobs and economic benefits to Quebec.  Hydro-Quebec suggested that it is seeking a speedy solution to the issue – the subject of a moratorium on new approvals issued earlier this month, citing an ""unprecedented"" level of demand.  The utility also wants to put a cap on the amount of power that crypto-miners can draw during the year, in an effort to free up power for other customers. That concern has been at the heart of many of the disputes seen in North America between crypto miners, local governments and residents.  Hydro-Quebec wrote:  ""The economic analysis will favor customers who will be ready to operate their facilities as quickly as possible. In addition, Hydro-Québec could request that these customers decrease their electricity use, for a maximum of 300 hours per year, to allow it to ensure the delivery of electricity to all of its customers, particularly during the winter peak period.""

Police in the eastern Chinese province of Anhui Province seized more than 200 computers used for bitcoin and ether mining after the local power grid company reported a spike in electricity use, according to Xinhua news agency.  One suspect allegedly stole 150,000 kW hours of electricity between April and May 2018, when the power grid first alerted police of the theft. The Chinese national, identified only by his surname Ma, reportedly told police that he dreamed of making money through crypto mining.  He bought the hardware in April, but later found out the daily power cost was over 6,000 yuan ($921). As a result, Ma said, his mining operation was not profitable at the time of his arrest.  Allegations of power theft have led to the arrest of bitcoin miners in China before. In April, there were at least two cases where bitcoin miners were taken into custody for allegedly stealing power, as previously reported by CoinDesk.  In another instance, six individuals were arrested in Tianjin. Police alleged that the suspects used 600 cryptocurrency miners to generate bitcoin with power taken from the local power grid.
