However, just one year ago, the price of Stellar was less than one cent.

42401172,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxes,1520377205,Twitter Pledges Action on Crypto Scams After Account Bans,"Social media giant Twitter appears to be cracking down on cryptocurrency scam accounts – but several members of the crypto Twitter community have been caught in the fray.  Responding to a tweet by Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey wrote that ""we are on it."" Yet the statement drew some swift critiques given that, in recent days, a number of accounts – including the support team for cryptocurrency exchange Kraken – reported that they had seen their accounts restricted despite trying to warn others about copycat accounts that mimic well-known industry members.  Kraken's loss, at least, was temporary, with the ban eventually being lifted, according to subsequent tweets, after Dorsey's account became the target of community ire.  But other influencers such as Brooke Maller, aka @bitcoinmom, haven't been so lucky. As Mallers explained, her account appeared to have been shadow banned – a method by which an account is rendered unviewable by others despite the user in question not knowing that they've been hidden – prompting comments from other users.  She told to CoinDesk:  ""People just started DMing me that they couldn't see my tweets in threads. It would say 'tweet unavailable.' Others said they aren't getting notifications when I tweet. But no word from Twitter. There is some really weird shit going on for crypto Twitter people right now. A rash of permanent bans and suspensions.""  Neeraj Agrawal  , director of communications at the Washington, DC.-based think tank Coin Center, also reported having trouble with his account, although it appears to have been reinstated. Several Twitter users who use and promote Ripple's XRP token have also tweeted about shadow bans through their networks.  The issue of copying verified Twitter accounts to trick cryptocurrency users has become increasingly prevalent.  Many of the threads in question begin with an influencer posting a tweet, after which a similarly designed account will tweet out some offer of free cryptocurrency – provided that an initial amount is sent to a listed address.  In order to make the posts seem more legitimate, other spam accounts will then post supportive messages, claiming that they have already received payouts.  More recent post activity indicates that those behind the spam accounts are using shortened links to hide wallet addresses, indicating that Twitter's anti-spam efforts are sweeping for that type of information.  Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

42401175,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxgq,1520372723,Wyoming 'Utility Token' Bill Heads to Governor,"Wyoming's state legislature has cleared a bill that would exempt certain types of crypto assets from securities laws.  The bill passed by a vote of 27-3, public records show, with no senators abstaining. The final vote on the bill was originally expected to take place last week but it was postponed last-minute amid further deliberations. Still, the measure now heads to Governor Matt Mead for final approval.  In that time, however, lawmakers finished work on measures to exempt cryptocurrencies from the state's money transmission laws and approve the use of blockchain-based records for corporations.  According to data from LegiScan, the ICO exemption measure moved relatively quickly through the Senate, having received committee approval in the past few days and passage via a second chamber reading on March 1.  As previously reported  , lawmakers in the state want to put in place carveouts for certain parties – namely developers – involved in the creation of so-called ""utility tokens."" Unlike tokens that are a clear investment vehicle, the exemption would apply to those that ""has not been marketed by the developer or seller as an investment"" and ""is exchangeable for goods and services.""  The bill is the first of its kind that would legally define how certain types of cryptographic tokens are treated. Thus far, the measure seems set for complete passage, as evidenced by its unanimous passage in the Wyoming House of Representatives in February.  Another bitcoin-friendly bill is also moving steadily through the Wyoming legislature, having moved largely in tandem with the ICO bill. HB19 – which was also unanimously passed in the House – exempts cryptocurrencies from the state's money transmission laws.

42401185,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxnj,1520370307,Bitconnect Promoter Claims FBI Investigating Defunct Crypto Scheme,"Former Bitconnect investor and promoter Trevon James is now claiming he spoke to the FBI about the now-defunct exchange and his involvement with the project.  In a YouTube video posted Monday, James further confirmed that he will be testifying about his role with the project in 10 days, though he did not specify what type of hearing this would be. That said, he indicated his knowledge of the exchange was limited, and that he did have any information about its plans or roadmap.  James said he expected his testimony to be similar to the 90-minute conversation he claims to have had with the FBI agent, wherein he explained his experience with Bitconnect as a user.  He continued, saying, ""I'm glad that I don't know anything so that means there's no proof that I knew anything.""  However, his testimony may not be strictly related to Bitconnect’s shutdown or its operations, he said, adding:  “It’s really about the SEC. Testimony is really important you know, for the entire crypto space because ... it’s about securities. Is Bitconnect a security, are cryptocurrencies, can they be considered securities? That’s what it’s about, it’s not about whether I scammed people.”  “It’s about whether Bitconnect is a security and whether I knew,” James concluded.  Stepping back, the SEC has been opening up on its attitudes toward token sales of late, allegedly issuing a plethora of subpoenas to startups that have launched initial coin offerings (ICOs). It is unclear what information the agency is looking for or which groups have received the legal documentation so far.  Still, the move also comes weeks after chairman Jay Clayton described every token sale as a securities sale, and James' comments shed additional light on what has so far been an opaque investigation.  So far, no token sale has been registered with the SEC, Clayton said at the time, though he followed up by stating he would like to draw more of a distinction between cryptocurrencies and ICOs.  ""ICOs that are securities offerings, we should regulate them like we regulate securities offerings. End of story,"" he said.  The FBI did not respond to a request for comment by press time.

Jihan Wu, the controversial co-CEO of bitcoin mining hardware maker Bitmain, will discuss the idea of central bank digital currencies in a speech Wednesday, a source told CoinDesk.  Wu is perhaps the most highly-anticipated speaker at the three-day D.C. Blockchain Summit, which kicked off on Tuesday with a developer event.  Named as one of CoinDesk's Most Influential in Blockchain for 2017, Wu is at the head of the world's largest provider of bitcoin mining hardware, which analysts have estimated made as much as $4 billion in profits last year, according to Fortune. Depending on who you ask, Wu is either Enemy Number One or, in the words of Roger Ver, someone who has ""poured his life and soul into this for years.""  Wu's chosen topic – central bank-issued digital currencies – is perhaps just as controversial. A number of institutions worldwide have looked at the question of a central bank using the tech that underlies bitcoin to further digitize their money. Yet despite support from quarters of the finance community, observers say that 2018 is unlikely to be the year that such a launch takes place.  DC set for summit  Wu's appearance forms part of a wider event in D.C., which will see regulators, government officials, startups and business leaders converge to talk blockchain and cryptocurrency.  The conference is being organized by Chamber of Digital Commerce and Georgetown University’s Center for Financial Markets and Policy. In anticipation of the three-day event, the Chamber also released a white paper regarding intellectual property issues and blockchain.  Government officials are also among the notable attendees, including James Sullivan, the deputy assistant secretary for services at the International Trade Administration, which falls within the purview of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

The North Carolina Secretary of State Securities Division issued a temporary cease-and-desist order on March 2 against the European project PowerMining Pool. The move comes just under two months after that department issued a cease-and-desist order that faulted the now-defunct investment scheme BitConnect for failing to register its offerings as securities.  Documents released by the state allege that PMP utilized problematic sales tactics. They also said the local PMP campaign violated the state's Securities Act with business practices that ""threaten immediate and irreparable public harm.""  PMP sells ""shares"" for bitcoin, claiming to mine seven different cryptocurrencies on behalf of its shareholders. The startup's site makes claims about shareholders reaping ""totally passive"" profits just hours after setting up an account and depositing bitcoin. Akin to other investment schemes, people are encouraged to solicit others and are promised additional rewards as a bonus.  Notably, according to the order, PMP affiliates in North Carolina used a range of methods to market the sale, including social media platforms like YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and even local classified ads.  That said, it's reportedly unclear if some of the names attached to the project are real people.  ""The Securities Division has been unable to confirm whether Andrew Conti and Mike Conti, of central Europe, are real people,"" the order also states.

42401171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxfr,1520358021,FinCEN: Money Transmitter Rules Apply to ICOs,"The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) published a letter Tuesday that indicates the U.S. agency will apply its regulations to those who conduct initial coin offerings (ICOs).  In the letter, which was sent to U.S. Senator Ron Wyden last month, FinCEN's assistant secretary for legislative affairs, Drew Maloney, explained that both developers and exchanges involved in the sale of an ICO-derived token would be liable to register as a money transmitter and comply with the relevant statutes around anti-money laundering and know-your-customer (KYC) rules.  The letter reads:  ""...a developer that sells convertible virtual currency, including in the form of ICO coins or tokens, in exchange for another type of value that substitutes for currency is a money transmitter and must comply with AML/CFT requirements that apply to this type of [money services business]. An exchange that sells ICO coins or tokens, or exchanges them for other virtual currency, fiat currency, or other value that subsitutes for currency, would typically also be a money transmitter.""  The distinction is a notable one given the recent regulatory developments around the blockchain funding model. Washington, D.C.-based Coin Center, which published the letter after it became available today, explained in a blog post that, under this interpretation of the law, a group that conducts an ICO that involves U.S. residents but hadn't registered with FinCEN as a money transmitter and adhere to KYC regulations may be charged with a felony under federal law.  Coin Center later told CoinDesk in an email: ""We do not agree with their assessment and believe such a decision should be subject to the open rulemaking process.""  That said, the FinCEN letter goes on to note that ""ICO arrangements vary"" and that there are jurisdictional differences depending on the make-up of an ICO and its associated token. Token sales structured as a sale of securities or derivatives would fall under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations, respectively.  FinCEN indicated that it such regulatory obligations as they relate to ICO participants would depend on the relevant circumstances as well.  ""The application of AML/CFT obligations to participants in ICOs will depend on the nature of the financial activity involved in any particular ICO. This is the matter of the facts and circumstances of each case.""  According to Maloney, FinCEN is working with other U.S. agencies on this issue, explaining:  ""FinCEN is working closely with the [SEC] and the [CFTC] to clarify and enforce the AML/CFT obligations of businesses engaged in ICOs activities that implicate the regulatory authorities of these agencies.""

With the move, Illinois joins a growing list of U.S. states that are considering such measures, and the bill – filed in February and previously unreported – marks the third effort of its kind to emerge in 2018. The trend got started in January with Arizona, then Georgia lawmakers threw their hat in the ring the following month.  Illinois' House Bill 5335 states:  ""[I]n addition to any other method of payment provided for by law, the Department shall accept payment for any tax imposed by the State and administered by the Department by cryptocurrency.""  The language in the Illinois measure – proposed by Representative Michael J. Zalewski and initially submitted on Feb. 15 – largely mirrors the other two proposals, calling for tax officials to accept cryptocurrency and convert the payments to U.S. dollars within a day.  Public records indicate that on March 5, the bill was passed to the Illinois House Revenue and Finance Committee for deliberation.  As with the bill in Georgia, it remains to be seen whether the legislation will attract the kind of interest the idea has garnered in Arizona.

42401190,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxuc,1520348162,XRP Outlook Sours as Coinbase Quashes Listing Rumor,"Ripple's XRP token was the darling of the crypto markets 24 hours ago on rampant speculation that the cryptocurrency will finally take its spot on Coinbase's exchanges. But it wasn't to be.  Prices popped to a 12-day high of $1.08 before Coinbase poured cold water on the enthusiasm, making it clear via Twitter that it has no intention of adding XRP to its existing pairs – yet, anyway.  Fueling the rumor, was talk that Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Coinbase president and COO Asiff Hirji would appear together on CNBC's ""Fast Money"" program on Tuesday. Later, a CNBC article confirmed the appearances, but said they were separate and unrelated interviews.  So, the twin rebuttals look to have taken the steam out of the XRP rally, pushing the prices to a low of $0.93 soon before press time. The cryptocurrency is now down 11.58 percent over 24 hours.  More generally, Korean exchanges are driving XRP's trading volume, with Bithumb, Upbit, and Coinone accounting for close to 38 percent of the total seen in the last 24 hours.  Price chart analysis indicates that the retreat from yesterday's 12-day high has weakened the bulls, but the slightest of positive comments from Ripple CEO Garlinghouse might put a bid under the cryptocurrency once more.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  XRP ran into offers above the descending trendline resistance (drawn from the Jan. 28 high and Feb. 17 high) yesterday and closed (as per UTC) at $0.93, adding credence to the bearish 50-day moving average (MA) and 100-day MA crossover.  The token's dip below the ascending trendline support (drawn from the Dec. 7 low and Feb. 6 low) has weakened the bulls and opened the doors for a drop to $0.86 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the Dec. 7 low and Jan. 4 high).  The relative strength index (RSI) is biased bearish (below 50.00).  View  While the daily chart seems to favor the bears, still only a daily close (as per UTC) below $0.8610 (78.6 percent Fibonacci retracement) would confirm bearish reversal and could yield drop to 200-day MA located at $0.65.  On the bull side, a high volume break above the 100-day MA of $1.10 would signal a continuation of the rally from the Feb. 6 lows below $0.57 and allow a stronger rally to $1.38–$1.40.  XRP/BTC chart  View  So, XRP/BTC will likely break below the March 3 low of 0.000078 BTC and drop to 0.00006151 BTC (Dec. 26 low).  On the higher side, a daily close (as per UTC) above 0.000095175 BTC (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement) would signal bearish invalidation.

42401181,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcLxll,1520344813,Crypto Exchange Creating Wallet Blacklist to Fight Fentanyl Crisis,"A Canada-based cryptocurrency exchange wants to coordinate with other startups around the world to help fight the international fentanyl epidemic.  Einstein, based in Vancouver, is trying to obtain lists of wallet addresses associated with fentanyl arrests and indictments, said Christine Duhaime, the firm's chief anti-money-laundering officer.  In parallel, the firm is also pursuing partnerships with other exchanges, starting in its home country and in the U.S., ""to build a global database of bad wallet holders,"" said Duhaime, who also runs an eponymous law firm and is the founder of the Digital Finance Institute, a think tank.  The goal is for Einstein and other exchanges to prevent their customers from sending cryptocurrency to these wallets from their exchange accounts, Duhaime told a suit-and-tied crowd of 200 at the Blockchain for Business and Government conference in Toronto, Monday.  While cryptocurrency ranks at the bottom among ways fentanyl is paid for – bank wires and traditional money transmitters are more commonly used – Duhaime framed Einstein’s efforts to combat the drug as philanthropic.  She told attendees:  ""We would do a blacklist of wallets as our giveback [to society].""  Local impact  Still, there's good reason for a Canadian exchange, one of the few serving the market actively, to seek to break ground on such an effort.  Fentanyl is a synthetic drug that's 50 times stronger than heroin and was responsible for a reported 66 percent of overdose-related deaths in the U.S. in 2016. But Vancouver is the ""ground zero"" of the problem, Duhaime said, with fentanyl accounting for nearly all the Canadian city’s 922 drug overdose deaths that year.  She related a story of the teenage daughter of the head of AML compliance at a global bank who died from taking fentanyl at a graduation party. Even first responders have died from accidentally touching the stuff.  If successful, Einstein’s effort could conceivably help the cryptocurrency space overcome its lingering public image as a hive of criminality. However, the strategy may not sit well with long-time crypto users who value their privacy highly and worry about the effect blacklists have on the fungibility of bitcoin and other tokens.  A more immediate obstacle, Duhaime told CoinDesk, is that law enforcement in Canada has been reluctant to provide Einstein with wallet addresses tied to fentanyl cases, out of concern that doing so would violate privacy laws.  In response, she said, she has argued that not even bank account numbers are considered identifying information under Canadian law, and noted that wallet addresses are public. The agencies are reconsidering, she said.  Team effort  Einstein already has a blacklist of addresses associated with ransomware, but it was able to put that one together on its own. That’s because ransomware victims who were Einstein customers came to the company with the information, Duhaime said.  The fentanyl effort, by contrast, will require law enforcement's help.  While acknowledging that criminals have ways to hide their tracks on the blockchain, she told CoinDesk that fentanyl users are likely ""not as sophisticated"" as other bad actors and less apt to change wallets or tumble their coins.  In an earlier presentation at the conference, Michael Gokturk, Einstein’s CEO, acknowledged the irony of trying to position his company as a model of compliance in a market whose very creation was an act of rebellion.  He said:  “Cryptocurrencies need government regulation to deter price manipulation and related wrongs, but the absence of of such regulation is one of the biggest reasons that investors buy into cryptocurrencies in the first place.”  Possibly compounding the challenge, Einstein, founded about a year ago, is currently a pipsqueak among exchanges, which might limit its clout in persuading potential partners to join the effort.  Gokturk said Einstein is currently handling $20 million to $30 million in daily volume (in USD), which would put it at the low end of the top 50 tracked by CoinMarketCap.  By comparison, Coinbase’s GDAX, which ranks 12th, does about $240 million daily.  Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

According to a report by Caixin today, authorities have shut down some exchanges' channels on China's dominant social messaging app, WeChat.  In one example, the official account of OKEx on WeChat has been blocked, while links to all previous content are now merely showing a notification that reads:  ""The platform may have violated relevant laws and regulations after being reviewed per users' complaints. The account is currently blocked and content is not available.""  While the company has apparently denied interference by regulators, Caixin said it has confirmed that the WeChat censorship is a result of tightened official oversight on platforms that still offer cryptocurrency services to Chinese investors.  As reported by CoinDesk, following the ban on initial coin offerings (ICO) by the People's Bank of China in September, OKCoin, once a major cryptocurrency exchange based in China, moved its crypto-to-crypto trading platform OKEx overseas.  Since it still offers services for Chinese investors, its official account on WeChat had become a major communication channel for the distribution of trading information among users.  So far, though, Huobi.com, which also has an overseas trading platform available in mainland China, still remains functional on WeChat.  The Caixin report adds that regulators are also looking to urge law enforcement agencies to further block the IP addresses of overseas crypto exchanges. Drawing the authorities' attention is that, by listing new ICO tokens, exchanges are flouting the ban on offering ICOs to domestic investors.

Young Dirty, real name Bar-Son James, is the face of the appropriately named Dirty Coin, a cryptocurrency being produced in partnership between the estate of Ol' Dirty and Link Media Partners, an entertainment industry firm. Dirty Coin (ticker symbol ODB) will exist as a token on the TAO blockchain network, and is set to be traded on the AltMarket exchange later this year when the coin goes live.  It's a notable launch, given last year's spate of celebrity-endorsed ICOs – and the subsequent warning from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that such endorsements may break ""anti-touting"" laws.  In the case of Dirty Coin, the project is aimed at both serving as a funding base for an upcoming Young Dirty album, as well as a means for fans to access shows and buy merchandise. The coin will be able to be used to purchase merchandise tied to the late rapper as well.  ""If fans basically bought a Dirty Coin before the concert, they have a better chance of getting in, probably for the price of nothing. So it’s a big opportunity for our fans,"" Young Dirty said in an interview.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Young Dirty suggested that the project may spur other performance artists to take a closer look at cryptocurrency, which he called ""the biggest thing known to man.""  ""When other artists get involved, I think there's gonna be a chain reaction,"" he commented.  Though an exact date hasn't been set for the launch, Dirty Coin will be sold in what its backers call an ""initial artist offering,"" expected to be held this summer.  “Music thrives creatively and financially when it’s in the hands of the artist themselves. By removing the price tag of experimentation, we’re able to deliver for both the artist and their fans,” said Bryce Weiner, CEO of AltMarket.  As for what his father would have thought about the growth in cryptocurrencies – bitcoin would first emerge some four years after his death in 2004 – Young Dirty told CoinDesk:  ""He would've been like, 'I knew this was coming.'""

CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) rose to an intraday high of $11,660 yesterday, yet closed the day (as per UTC) below the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance of $11,600. The failure to hold above the critical resistance has not gone down well with the market as the cryptocurrency fell to a low of $10,890 today.  The rejection at the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance and today's break below $11,000 look to have weakened the bull case on the technical charts, and a major positive move looks increasingly unlikely in the short-term.  Daily chart  The above chart (prices as per Bitfinex) shows:  Bitcoin created a bearish ""inverted hammer"" (also known as a shooting star) at the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline resistance yesterday. This is a bearish reversal pattern that occurs at the top of the uptrend. That said, only a negative follow-through today would indicate BTC has topped out.  The cryptocurrency has dipped below the trendline sloping downwards from the Dec. 17 high and Jan. 6 high. A close (as per UTC) below the trendline would weaken the bull case.  Also, BTC bulls has breached the support of the ascending trendline (drawn from Feb. 6 low and Feb. 26 low).  So, yesterday's price action highlights exhaustion near the all-important resistance. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart below signals scope for a drop to $10,900-$10,600.  4-hour chart  Having faced rejection above $11,600, BTC fell below trendline support, while the relative strength index (RSI) has breached the horizontal trendline support.  As of writing, BTC is trading around the 4-hour 50 MA and could soon extend losses to $10,675.    Moving averages give mixed messages        The 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA are sloping upwards in favor of the bulls. However, the 50-day MA is still pointing bearishly down.  View  BTC could drop below drop to $10,900–$10,600 as indicated by the bearish set up on the 4-hour chart. However, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 10-day MA (seen now at $10,837) would signal bullish invalidation.  In the worst case scenario, a daily close (as per UTC) below the descending 50-day MA could yield a sell-off to $7,960 (Feb. 2 low).  On the higher side, a close above the inverse head-and-shoulders neckline would open up gains towards $17,000.

42380411,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYcP,1520330459,"Blockchain Needs Centralization, Says Chinese SEC Official","An official from one of China's financial regulators argued at the ""Two Sessions"" conference in Beijing on Sunday that blockchains are better if not completely decentralized.  Acting as a policy advisor at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference this week, Zhang Ye, head of the technology unit at China's Securities Regulatory Commission, encouraged the public sector in China to embrace advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and blockchain technology in public services.  However, at the same time, he cautioned that, while he believes in the potential of blockchain, to fully achieve its benefits will rely on using a centralized infrastructure.  ""Blockchain's advocates for absolute decentralization have no solid ground, because [blockchain] itself is a software developed in a centralized way. So is the public key infrastructure, which remains an important feature adopted by blockchain,"" Zhang said in an interview with Securities Times, an official mouthpiece that covers the securities industry in China.  He further said that, while in some scenarios a decentralized environment may be advantageous, it's questionable whether all current applications need to be decentralized.  ""The key is to explore how to achieve decentralization through a centralized infrastructure,"" he continued.  This isn't the first time such comments have been made by officials in China.  As reported last October, officials from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) including Yao Qian, the director at the central bank's digital currency research lab, have outlined a vision for a centrally issued and managed digital currency, which may still be decentralized in its underlying technology.  Yet, in January, the PBoC's vice governor went far as picturing scenarios that could remove standard features of public blockchaina such as the peer-to-peer mechanism and anonymity from a centrally issued digital currency.  In addition, Li Lihui, former president of the Bank of China and now head of the blockchain research at a fintech self-regulation group in China, previously commented that most of the current efforts in blockchain adoption from entities such as IBM and R3 are, in essence, designed with multiple centralizations instead complete decentralization.

42380418,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYhR,1520326831,Bitcoin on Lightning Too Risky? Maybe Ice Cream Will Tempt You,"I scream. You scream. Crypto screams for ice cream?  At least that's what three college students are hoping for in starting an ice-cream delivery service in San Francisco, one that will run solely on bitcoin's in-development Lightning Network at launch.  Dubbed Block and Jerry's, a play on the popular U.S. brand Ben and Jerry's, the service was created to give real consumers a reason to push forward the bleeding-edge payments technology – one that, after years of ideation, is just now beginning to see real testing and use.  ""We think that this is a motivating factor to jump into bitcoin and start playing around with the Lightning Network and getting to understand it,"" Block and Jerry's co-founder Rob Durst told CoinDesk.  With the news, Block and Jerry's also joins a small, but growing number of businesses (both existing and experimental) that have set up shops connected to Lightning's growing network. Now nearly 1,000 nodes strong, this momentum shows a growing interest in the scaling technology, positioned as a way to move transactions off of the blockchain in an effort to allow bitcoin to handle greater adoption.  As such, an interest in getting a whole new host of people involved in cryptocurrency is at the core of the Block & Jerry's project.  ""Basically we’re just a household of guys who are interested in cryptocurrency and creating web applications for people,"" developer Jeff Tang explained.  Not only did the team develop the application, but they also devised a step-by-step guide for setting up Lightning and transacting on the network  Durst explained:  ""We really are in the process of creating a very straightforward experience. 'I want to buy ice cream, I’m not the most experienced bitcoin user or even computer user, 'How can I jump in?'""  And with ice cream at the forefront, Durst said expects Block & Jerry's to be able to get a spate of new users excited about the technology.  ""I think it’s cool, I will buy a sticker, but my mum doesn’t care about that,"" he said.  Still, it's best to think of Block and Jerry's as an experiment, a vision for how merchants might use Lightning to accept bitcoin in the future.  For example, the founder aren't exactly after money – they're not accepting any other cryptocurrencies (or even credit cards) – and in using their website's chat service, they're cagey on delivery times.  Ice cream names such as ""Doge Food,"" ""Vitalik Garcia"" and ""Segwit2x"" further show that the website is catering to a niche crowd.  But it's worth noting that the idea behind Block and Jerry's is still somewhat controversial given that sending real bitcoin payments on Lightning remains risky.  Elizabeth Stark, the CEO of Lightning Labs, which is developing a Lightning implementation, is one of the notable members of the technology's movement that is worried users could lose money transaction on the network, and that such issues could hold back development.  She's noted, in particular, that future Lightning releases may not be compatible with the current mainnet, meaning payment channels started today will need to be closed in the event of a new release.  In response to the launch of Blockstream's sticker store, one of the first to demo a Lightning-based merchant experience, Stark tweeted, ""It's one thing to have people changing code on their own. It's another for a company to be promoting software that is going to lose users money.”  As such, Stark and others will be unlikely to give Block & Jerry's the stamp of approval.  Brain freeze  That said, the co-founders of the project believe transacting over the testnet just doesn't feel ""as significant.""  And, in part, the effort can be seen as one that's aiming to drive a more immediate consumer experience via Lightning. The Block & Jerry's team believes the more people interact with the early technology, the more they might be inspired to contribute to its development.  So far, Lightning has been mostly the territory of experienced crypto developers, since it lacks a polished user interface and requires users to be somewhat familiar with command line code.  Yet, the team believes it's created a guide that'll make interacting with the network much easier, not just for crypto users but also developers that don't have blockchain specific programming skills.  ""We’re just doing what we can with the skills that we have,"" Tang said.  And Durst echoed that, saying, ""I think this is a cool demonstration of what is possible for the more average developer.""  Yet, what's perhaps most notable is that disguised within the project is an excitement and urgency about getting bitcoin ready for mainstream adoption.  Durst concluded:  “If you’re not making much money, and each dollar counts, I think end of the day you need a platform that offers cheaper, faster confirmations. And I think the Lightning Network can do this.”  Ice cream image via Shutterstock",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Rachel-Rose O'Leary,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/03/06/bitcoin-on-lightning-too-risky-maybe-ice-cream-will-tempt-you,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b9c699fdfcd77f5182349bc5cd496d8d35253310-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42380401,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYSL,1520312447,What If the SEC Is Going After the SAFT?,"Rumors seem to be feeding rumors as it relates to a spate of subpoenas sent out recently to initial coin offering (ICO) issuers by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  At press time, it's unclear when or whether the 80 or so subpoenas (or maybe it's 200) were sent out; or which group of enthusiasts – be it advisers, lawyers, the issuers or investors – received the outreach. Industry experts believe there is probably a theme uniting the subpoenas, but even that is unconfirmed.  And while many, unsurprisingly, believe the SEC is going after fraudulent issuers, recent reporting indicates the SEC may be working on a systematic investigation of projects working under the simple agreements for future tokens (SAFTs) framework.  A more formal SAFT framework was developed in October 2017 by attorney Marco Santori and the team behind a pioneering project called Filecoin. SAFT is a broad concept that explains how token issuers could remain on the right side of securities laws when issuing what basically amounts to coupons for tokens at a future date when the platform they are used on is complete.  And while some remain measured, one knowledgeable source (who wished to remain unnamed) was extremely candid in talking about the subject, telling CoinDesk:  ""The SEC is targeting SAFTs. The new approach of the SEC is to consider tokens as both utility and security at the same time, meaning a token can bring utility to a platform but at the same time can be considered as a security if you sold it to parties that mainly looked for profit on its increase in value.""  A number of the biggest name ICOs in the space, from Kik's Kin to Filecoin, used the SAFT framework to sell crypto tokens. However, those who have haven't been entirely forthcoming on any regulatory brokering that may (or may not be) happening behind the scenes.  Kik, for one, declined to comment on CoinDesk's inquiry about whether they received an SEC subpoena and Filecoin didn't respond to a request for comment. The SEC did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk either.  Still, there are even larger more speculative questions that are now being asked, namely, what will happen to those who invested time and money if SAFTs don't satisfy securities law?  Issuers in trouble  Those consequences appear to start with issuers. As such, understanding what the SEC is asking for in their requests for information and subpoenas is key.  According to one industry lawyer that wanted to remain anonymous, the 25-page subpoena received by his client was ""hyper-detailed,"" asking about so many things he described it as ""hellish.""  It's unknown if the SEC is simply trying to get a handle on the industry, or if it's interested in something more specific, like what kinds of token sales have launched since the agency halted the multi-million dollar Munchee ICO in December.  In fact, many see the Munchee administrative order, which determined the issuer had sold unregistered securities (even though the token was to be used for utility on a platform in the future), as an example of how the SEC would view token issuers.  ""If I were consulting for token companies, I would be terrified, and that's not the reaction [the SEC is] seeing,"" an attorney told CoinDesk.  Indeed, it may be that the SEC has become more aggressive because it doesn't believe the message it sent through that enforcement action was received.  Should this be the case, and the SEC decides to pursue an enforcement action based on a subpoena, a number of options are on the table for issuers themselves.  First, a negotiation would begin between the agency and the company in question. The company could then either agree to settle or go to court.  If the company settles, the information regarding that settlement would be released to the public, and the company would agree to certain steps to come into compliance with securities law. At that point, other issuers would be able to analyze the settlement and assess how their own token launches differ.  If the company decides to go to court, they'll be up against the SEC, a powerful financial regulator, yet the SEC is in new territory and has no guarantee the courts will side with their arguments.  Yet, none of this will happen fast, according to Timothy Peterson a former SEC enforcement attorney now with Murphy & McGonigle.  He told CoinDesk:  ""For ICO issuers, the main thing to understand is that this is a marathon, not a sprint. The SEC will not go away with a simple response. The process is iterative.""  Investors' fates  As such, investors shouldn't feel the effects of the probe for some time.  Several securities attorneys who spoke to CoinDesk noted that it's worth keeping in mind that the SEC's mission is to protect investors, so any remedy is likely to ensure investors see returns. This is important for investors to understand, because it gives them a sense of how their investment's fate might be decided and the amount of time it will take.  Let's imagine that there is a focused sweep targeting SAFTs (though no one has verified that there is). Investors might be asking: what happens if the SEC comes out and says ""SAFTs are illegal""?  The truth is, it just won't be that simple. As we've previously reported, every offering in this space comes down to facts and circumstances.  As Coin Center's Jerry Brito put it in a phone call with CoinDesk. ""A SAFT isn't a thing. They're all going to be different,"" because each one is going to be written a little differently by different attorneys. Though there is a model most probably start with.  The SEC would look at them one by one. The best an existing project could do is look at the outcome of one case and ask themselves how much their own offering resembles it. Investors, of course, can do the same.  If the SEC comes down hard on a particular version of the SAFT, it might order a project to return remaining funds to SAFT holders, such an order could be complicated if the funds have been transferred to a foreign entity (as has often been the case), such as a Swiss foundation.  Whatever remedy regulators pursued in a given case, there's no reason to believe another would resolve the same way. We won't see a blanket statement from the state about SAFTs in general.  ""A court looking at a particular offering would never say that the SAFT is broken,"" Brito explained. It would only ever make a judgement about that particular instrument. How was it constructed? How was it marketed? What were investors led to believe? And so on.  There is one way that the SEC could take a broader approach to the sector. It could offer a regulatory guidance, one that provided generalized views on how token sales can and can be conducted within securities law, including its take on SAFTs.  ""I don't think that's very likely,"" Brito said.  But even then, the SEC is unlikely to punish investors for buying an instrument they believed created in a responsible fashion. As Peterson wrote:  ""One would hope the SEC would see SAFTs as agreements put together in good faith.""

42380412,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8NYdf,1520309159,GMO Has Mined Millions of Dollars in Bitcoin Already,"The cryptocurrency mine launched by Japanese IT firm GMO Internet has generated more than $3 million in revenue over the past three months.  According to a mining report released on March 5, the publicly-traded company disclosed that it had generated 23 BTC, 93 BTC and 124 BTC in December, January and February, respectively. All told, those coins are worth approximately $2.67 million as of press time according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index.  In addition, the firm further reported a total mining income of 525 bitcoin cash during the same period, an amount valued at $654,000 at current prices. All told, GMO's mining venture brought in a little over $3.3 million in revenue within months since its start.  That said, the data provided by GMO doesn't offer a complete picture of the mine's financial status, including the cost at which those coins came. It's unclear whether the number of cryptocurrencies brought in exceeded operating expenses at any point during the three-month period.  GMO's report also detailed its growth in processing capacity.  With a most-recent hashrate of 108 petahashes per second (PH/s) by the end of February, GMO has set a goal of achieving 3,000 PH/s within this year. Currently, the bitcoin network boasts a hashrate of 22,125 PH/s, based on data published by Blockchain.  As reported before, the firm initially unveiled the plan to launch its mining unit last September, which officially went live by the end of last year in northern Europe.  Past statements indicate that the mine will likely see additional revenue sources starting later this year. GMO said in February that it also aims to step up the effort by offering cryptocurrency cloud mining services in August this year.

Plattsburgh, according to reports, is weighing a proposed lawhttps://www.cityofplattsburgh-ny.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=229 that would impose a ""moratorium on commercial mining operations"" until city officials can consider ""zoning and land use laws and municipal lightning department regulations."" It was spurred by concerns over excessive power use in the area, drawn from Plattsburgh's access to hydroelectrical resources.  The proposed law was advanced by Mayor Colin Read, who told the Watertown Daily Times that the growth of crypto mining in Plattsburgh ""has increased our power usage and put us over our threshold, and it is affecting our ratepayers.""  According to the text of the measure – which will be the subject of a public hearing on March 15 – the moratorium would provide a degree of breathing space around discussions ""before commercial cryptocurrency mining operations [result] in irreversible change to the character and direction of the City.""  Speaking to WCAX, a local bitcoin miner said he understood the rationale of wanting to protect local constituents. But that said, David Bowman of Plattsburgh BTC added that he doesn't think a full moratorium is necessary.  ""I think it's not a great idea to just completely ban the whole thing – it's just too new,"" he told the news outlet.  The conflict among local officials, bitcoin miners and city ratepayers has played out elsewhere in the U.S., including in Washington State's Chelan County, which saw its own moratorium on high-rate customers – miners among them – amid a similar dispute in 2016.  Miners there ultimately saw their rates go up, though the region itself has attracted a number of mines given the hydro-power and relatively low cost of operation.
