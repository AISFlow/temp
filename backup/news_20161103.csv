42427141,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzYDh,1478206008,Bitcoin Price Drops 5% as New China Rumors Stoke Trading,"After weeks of gains, the price of bitcoin fell back today, dropping roughly 6% on unconfirmed reports that Chinese regulators may soon take measures to restrict domestic exchange activities.  First reported by Bloomberg, the news source is said to have published a report detailing how Chinese officials could soon prohibit domestic bitcoin exchanges from moving certain volumes of bitcoin and other digital currencies abroad.  Of note, the article alleges, are concerns that bitcoin exchange users may be buying bitcoin on local exchanges and selling abroad, thereby evading foreign exchange rules.  At press time, however, the article in question was not available online, though it was cited by other news outlets including Sina and ZeroHedge.  Price declines began at 15:00 UTC, seemingly coinciding with the spread of the news across social media. The price would fluctuate wildly over the course of the day's trading, rising to a high of $744 and falling to a low of $677.  But given the uncertainty surrounding the news, some analysts said the market was likely using the reports as an opportunity to capitalize on a pending market panic.  Adamant Research's Tuur Demeester told CoinDesk:  ""It's one of those things where a news article is really just an excuse for traders to sell instead of buy.""  Other analysts reported that similar behavior was likely given that fake news about China has often been used as way to encourage speculative market activity.  Such comments recall the height of bitcoin's price climb in 2013, when the news that China would perhaps ""ban"" the digital currency caused steep market declines.  ""We've had China scares like this so many times,"" Chris DeRose, the host of a popular bitcoin podcast, recalled.  He added: ""China is effectively a black box to us here.""

42427125,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXhh,1478201001,Financial Stability Board Expands Distributed Ledger Research,"An international body of regulators and government officials created in the wake of the 2008 financial panic is expanding its work on blockchain.  Since as early as last year, the Financial Stability Board has been researching the tech and its impact on the global financial system. The most recent update from the group was in July, when it said it was exploring “possible steps to address potential risks” related to digital currencies.  In a 3rd November speech at the Chatham House Banking Revolution Conference, FSB secretary general Svein Andresen suggested that the organization was beginning to move toward making policy recommendations related to the technology.  He told attendees:  “We have considered the financial stability implications of distributed ledger technology, and we continue to work in this area, jointly with Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures, to identify key issues that market participants and policymakers need to address.  Andresen went on to say that the FSB was working alongside the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a body within the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), on similar issues.  “This has covered members’ experimentation with distributed ledger technology and what they have learned, as well as experiences with innovation facilitators – sandboxes, hubs, and accelerators,” he remarked.  Andresen’s speech focused in part on fintech more broadly, suggesting that any policy recommendations from the FSB will likely be within that context. He gave no indication as to when the FSB might move to begin releasing the results of its work.

42427130,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXth,1478196066,Police Arrest Japanese Man Who Bought Bitcoin With Stolen Funds,"A Japanese man has reportedly been arrested and charged with computer fraud after allegedly stealing thousands of dollars from a local woman and using the funds to buy bitcoin.  Local  media reportshttp://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20161103/k10010754661000.html that 33-year-old Ryota Fujii committed identity fraud by using the unnamed woman’s personal ID information to purchase ¥600,000 (roughly $6,000 at press time) worth of bitcoin by way of a fraudulently obtained credit card. Those sources say it’s the first case of its kind to take place in Japan.  The suspect is said to have claimed that he stole the funds in order to settle outstanding debts against him.  “I had debts to pay back,” Fujii reportedly said.  Fujii allegedly pretended to be a money lender, setting up a fictitious account through which to funnel the funds. He then used that money to purchase bitcoin, according to local sources. The incident allegedly took place in January, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police told reporters.

42427136,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzY3h,1478189637,Thai Bank Tests Blockchain For Recordkeeping,"One of Thailand’s leading commercial banks is working with IBM on applying blockchain to certify official documents.  Kasikornbank  is seeking to cut operational costs related to recordkeeping, according to Reuters. The bank, one of the largest in Thailand, is reportedly looking to officially integrate the document certification service sometime next year.  The work reportedly won’t stop with internal applications, however.  Kasikornbank is said to be in discussions with other banks in Thailand, with the hope of establishing collaborative efforts that could see members of the country’s financial system connecting with one another via blockchain. Under the current plan, other banks alongside Kasikornbank could also use the proposed network to certify documents.  The bank has indicated its interest in pursuing applications of blockchain in the past.  In a release from April, Kasikornbank declared its intention to research and apply new technologies to its business lines, including machine learning and blockchain. At the time, the bank argued that blockchain represents “a technology that offers other benefits, e.g., reducing costs and increasing cross-border settlement efficiency that can be verified”.  The announcement perhaps represents a sea change within Thailand, given that two years ago, the specter of a bitcoin ban in the country led to disruptions in local exchange activity.  Thailand ultimately opted not to ban the digital currency, but issued a warning to local consumers about its use.

42427122,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXbh,1478181402,EU Legislators Advance Plan to Fund Blockchain Research,"The European Union is moving closer to establishing a dedicated task force focused on digital currencies.  Late last month, the EU Parliament passed its latest budget proposal, which includes language for a working group dedicated to the technology, its uses and risks. An aide for von Weizsäcker’s office told CoinDesk that the task force was included in the passed budget, but that now it is subject to future debate and approval between the parliament and the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch.  “Nothing is finalised yet,” the aide added.  The task force was first proposed by European Parliament member (MEP) Jakob von Weizsäcker in February. The group, according to its backers in the EU Parliament, will develop a regulatory framework for the economic bloc.  In a recent note to legislators, von Weizsäcker argued that the EU Parliament has an opportunity to boost its institutional knowledge of the tech, while at the same time providing a means to explore applications for government in particular.  He wrote:  ""This pilot project aims at creating a Task Force, staffed with regulatory and technical experts, in order to build up technical expertise, regulators capacity and develop use cases, especially for governmental applications, in the field of distributed ledger technology (DLT) as proposed in the Resolution of the European Parliament on virtual currencies.”  While subject to change, the task force could be funded by as much as €1m should the proposal be included in the final budget.

The move effectively finds two of the industry's most experienced legal veterans moving their practices to a new firm, headquarted in Palo Alto, California. (Santori joined Pillsbury in September 2014, while Murck was added to its roster in October 2015).  Both Murck and Santori also previously served with the Bitcoin Foundation, the long-troubled trade association dedicated to the open-source technology. Notably, Murck held a role as executive director, while Santori was chairman of its regulatory affairs committee.  In statements, Cooley partner Mike Lincoln lauded both of his new hires as ones that would position the firm to be highly competitive on financial technology.  ""Marco's experience and leadership in the fintech industry is unparalleled,"" Mike Lincoln, partner and chair of Cooley’s business department, said in a statement.  Lincoln went on to say:  ""Together with Patrick, and with the recent arrival of Andy Roth, Cooley delivers a unique and powerfully positioned resource for the global fintech community as it navigates the complex regulatory issues related to using innovative technologies in the financial sector.""

42427121,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXfh,1478176540,Microsoft Doubles Down on Ethereum With New Blockchain Product,"Microsoft will soon enter the next phase of its blockchain work with the formal launch of its Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network.  If successful, Microsoft hopes the projecthttps://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/blob/master/ethereum-consortium-blockchain-network/README.md will help entire industries work together to more easily build increasingly complex consortia that better leverage the network effects of shared, immutable ledgers.  As such, a major point of emphasis for the Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network will be usability. The product has been designed so that groups of companies can deploy a private ethereum network with a single click.  Released privately to Github earlier this month, the streamlined set-up process and new features are part of a larger push by Microsoft toward blockchain that has to date focused mostly on its Azure cloud product as well as the enterprise business market.  Microsoft Azure's principal blockchain architect, Marley Gray, ‎told CoinDesk:  ""We're focused on building a sandbox for developers, working with customers and partners to develop and test combinations of technologies, and ultimately, helping collections of customers select the right tools that solve specific business problems.""  In addition to the one-click deployment, the update includes five new tools the project's manager said are specifically designed to let consortia networks develop more complex smart contracts for any number of self-executing business applications.  Microsoft senior program manager Christine Avanessians highlighted one change that lets groups spin up consortia with as few as three nodes run from a single IP address.  While the service still enables geographically dispersed nodes via the cloud integration, the changes could make it easier for companies to test the efficiencies potentially created from an alternative set up.  Perhaps most importantly though, based on customer feedback on an earlier version, Avanessians said the Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network automatically creates user private keys to satisfy security requirements.  Avanessians told CoinDesk:  ""You no longer need to generate and provide a private key. The key is automatically generated from your provided passphrase, further simplifying the prerequisites.""  On the market for markets  This new incarnation of Microsoft's Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network is just the latest development in what is shaping up to be a competitive blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) industry.  Microsoft's biggest direct competitor for cloud-based BaaS services so far is IBM, which launched its own competing service in July. But startups are trying their hand at winning enterprise business as well.  Deloitte spin-off Nuco, for example, entered the market earlier this year specifically to offer services for building blockchain consortia.  In May, Microsoft Azure's chief technical officer told CoinDesk the company's overall goal for its own version of the service is to help global industries build blockchain consortia.  So far, most blockchain consortia have come from the financial sector, but Microsoft believes future industries will follow suit.  Already, blockchain consortia are springing up around the world, with efforts in China, Japan and Russia all announced in the last few months.  Dollar bills  While financial numbers on the burgeoning industry are tough to come by, one indicator of the revenue at stake can be found in Microsoft’s BaaS sandbox, which boasts products from a wide range of blockchain startups.  Monthly fees on the platform start with a base amount per virtual machine as low as about $14 and as high as about $90. The price increases based on the number of IP addresses ($2.98 per month) and the number of transactions conducted ($0.0036 per unit).  Support options range from a free introductory offer up to $1,000 per month for professional grade support.  Initially, the improved Ethereum Consortium Blockchain Network is available as part of a free trial to anyone. However, Gray says the long-term play is to charge users to host the network in the Microsoft Azure cloud computing environment.  Currently, Microsoft isn’t sharing the names of the companies building with the network, but Gray said that the company does already have customers using the service with more details to come.  Gray concluded:  ""We will have more to share soon.""

42427129,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJzXrh,1478172921,ABN Amro Joins R3 Blockchain Consortium,"ABN Amro has become the latest financial institution to join the R3 blockchain consortium.  The Dutch bank is an investor in blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings and is working with local academics on applications of the technology. The bank has also been doing internal work of its own, leading to speculation earlier this fall that it was developing a bitcoin wallet.  As an R3 member, the bank said that it expected to build on its past efforts. Arjan van Os, chief of ABN AMRO’s Innovation Centre, said in a statement:  “This is exactly the right time for us to step in. We already spend a lot of time developing and testing new technologies, on our own and together with other parties.  In May, ABN Amro director of transaction banking Karin Kersten explained that the bank was very much in a test-and-see stage when it comes to blockchain, but that it was investing resources across its various business lines. ABN Amro’s entry into R3 is perhaps a reflection of that continued process.  ""We are doing experiments and seeing if they work. We are learning by doing, and working on different levels. There’s not just one team working on the blockchain,"" Kersten told CoinDesk.  More than 60 companies worldwide have joined the R3 consortium to date. Last month, Russia payments firm QIWI became a member.
