The website is home to Bitcoin Core, the most popular software version of bitcoin’s code. To be clear: Bitcoin’s blockchain itself was not attacked, only the website hosting one copy of its open-source code.      Read more: What Is Bitcoin?      While the site was inaccessible, bitcoiners disseminated the software to newcomers wanting to download the code via a torrenting service, an open-source marketplace for sharing data. Bitcoin Core’s client includes a “magnet link” (that random alphanumeric string in the below tweet) which can be manually shared to download Bitcoin Core from services like uTorrent and BitTorrent. From this link, the user can locate the hash for where Bitcoin Core is stored on these services and download the software.      Called “distributed denial of service,” a DDoS attack occurs when a person or group uses multiple devices to spam a server or system with data requests, clogging its bandwidth and typically rendering a website inaccessible.    DDoS attacks common during Bitcoin price spikes    Bitcoin.org is now live again. Cobra, a pseudonymous developer who helps maintain Bitcoin.org, told CoinDesk that DDoS attacks are not uncommon during hot price action and that this specific attack may not be over.      “Basically, we got hit with a large DDoS, which is quite common around ATHs (all-time highs) and bull markets. It took us down for a while but for now we're back up, but we might go down on and off periodically depending on how long the attackers want to continue attacking.”      Cobra told CoinDesk that the IP traffic from the attack is Russian, but it’s anybody’s guess where the attackers are actually located. That’s because, in addition to the attackers using privacy preserving tools like virtual networks, most attackers launch DDoS attacks remotely from malware-infested devices, pseudonymous and independent researcher 6102 told CoinDesk.

42405597,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWLJ,1608386699,COVID and Big Tech Burnout Are Pushing Social Tokens Mainstream,"In 2020, COVID-19 forced creators, brands and artists to rethink their fan monetization and engagement strategies. Many turned to virtual engagements and live streaming. Others experimented with platforms like Patreon or tried to double down on monetizing their social media platforms like YouTube and Twitch. In our industry, it was social tokens that made the rare leap from crypto circles to consumer audiences.      Before this year, social tokens were an intriguing but mostly hypothetical alternative or additive way for creators, artists and brands to connect with their fan communities.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Kevin Chou is Founder of Rally, an open platform that allows creators, celebrities and brands to launch their own currency.    It didn’t take long for influential celebrities to see the value once the foundational tech was actually built. Akon, Ja Rule and Lil Yachty all announced tokens this year. The NBA’s Spencer Dinwiddie and Japanese superstar soccer player Keisuke Honda launched tokens, too, with esports and gaming seemingly on deck next.      Recently, Esports Insider noted that “esports is prime real estate for custom currency.” The diverse array of use cases that each of these social tokens offers is a testament to how far crypto has progressed when it comes to producing real-world usage and value instead of offering a solution for a problem that doesn’t exist.      The last few years have really taken their toll on creators who feel burned and burned out by big tech social platforms. It’s no secret that platforms rake in huge profits and often give creators the raw end of the deal. The rules are constantly changing and no matter how neutral a platform claims to be, there are always inherent biases behind their decisions to censor content. Creators can be deplatformed through unilateral decisions made by the platform, over which creators can exercise little or no control.      See also: Rapper Lil Yachty Sells Out Social Token in 21 Minutes      Instead of building a large platform’s revenue while only getting a small piece of it, creators are excited by the idea of using their own token to build their own economies and interact with fans on their terms, instead of on the whims of the platform. Blockchain takes the decision-making process out of the hands of large platforms and into the hands of creators and their fans and community members. It’s up to the creators and their communities to decide how the creator’s social token will be used and valued.    ICO 2.0?    In some sense, celebrities have given crypto a bad name. In 2017, there were several influencers who hyped dubious token projects. Traders piled money into initial coin offerings with unclear roadmaps and ultimately little intrinsic value.      This year saw a shift towards actual value creation and control. Instead of just advertising an ICO, influencers are plugging social tokens into their existing community-building efforts. Some have deployed personal tokens on apps like Discord to enable token-permissioned chats and channels. By integrating tokens into their existing communities rather than duping their fans into investing in third-party token projects, these creators are adding value to their brands and proving the usability of cryptonomics.    It’s up to the creators and their communities to decide how the creator’s social token will be used and valued.    Perhaps if bitcoin’s bull run continues, we’ll see celebrities like Logic and Maisie Williams create their own currencies. But one thing is certain, the conversation will shift from what creators are launching tokens to what they are doing with their tokens, grading social tokens on their usability and utility.      Creators, artists and brands and their fans will need to keep their guard up against crypto projects offering pump-and-dump mechanisms for short-term gains that will ultimately be a detriment to their relationships with their fans. Instead, they will need to focus on the long term and partner with crypto projects that aim to build richer solutions to community management and monetization.      The coming year will be one of experimentation where influencers will tap crypto to engage their fan bases with token-permissioned chat, voice and video functionality. We’ll likely see a ton of new activity. Discord community servers will launch their own social tokens as well. Artists will explore tokenized meet-ups, crowdfunding, and we’ll likely see social tokens plugged into the decentralized finance (DeFi) community as collateral for lending/borrowing.      As more developers get in on the action, DeFi enthusiasts build out the financial infrastructure and celebrities bring their fan bases into crypto, social tokens will go down in history as a bright spot of 2020.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Kevin Chou,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/19/covid-and-big-tech-burnout-are-pushing-social-tokens-mainstream,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e6607193e56636aedda234143262422098befc9e-1024x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405600,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWNH,1608383252,What This Digital Asset Investment Firm Missed and Capitalized On in 2020,"At the onset of the year, we (Arca) released our annual digital assets predictions, which focused on a few themes we believed would ultimately drive the majority of digital asset investment gains in 2020. We obviously did not anticipate COVID-19, a 35% jump in the M1 money supply or the accompanying acceleration of an already ongoing shift from a physical world to a digital world, but our predictions proved fairly accurate nonetheless.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management.    With 2020 concluding, it’s time to look back at how these predictions fared, and touch on a few important drivers of returns in 2020 that we did not foresee. The shift to digital is only getting started, and it is therefore highly unlikely that anything will change once the world re-opens.    Post mortem of 2020 predictions  Prediction #1: Thematic investing will drive digital asset performance, specifically in the following areas: rewards, structured tokens, staking and DeFi.    Thematic investing has unequivocally driven returns in 2020, and three of the four themes we identified have proven accurate. The outlier was the staking theme, which was not a large driver of year-to-date returns. In fact, most of the tokens that operate under “proof of stake” consensus have underperformed the market this year.      However, the reason for this underperformance can largely be attributed to the success of our other three identified themes. The growth of decentralized or open finance (DeFi) and the newfound focus on structuring tokens with real value accrual mechanisms and yields, driven primarily by user rewards, has made staking for yield somewhat obsolete from an attractive investment standpoint.      See also: Jeff Dorman – Digital Assets Are More Recession-Proof Than You Might Think      Let’s start with DeFi. This sector of the market has been hands down the runaway leader in digital assets, from both a growth perspective and a returns perspective. Our prediction was quite simple:    Decentralized finance is still tiny, but it is growing quickly and will likely be a major growth engine in 2020. Conversely, a ton of value has already accrued to centralized finance (CeFi) companies – Coinbase, Binance, Celsius, Deribit and BitMEX – and this market is getting very saturated. We believe DeFi will be the ""growth sector"" of 2020, while CeFi [centralized finance] will be a ""value sector."" As such, a blind basket of DeFi tokens will likely do very well regardless of which tokens you own, whereas in CeFi only one or two companies will win out and grow at the expense of others.    Digging deeper, decentralized trading exchanges (DEXs) have been one of the most impressive sub-sectors, posting all-time record high volumes, but we’ve also seen strength and growth coming from asset management protocols, synthetic assets, lending/borrowing platforms, and insurance. A basket of diversified DeFi tokens across insurance (NXM), asset management (YFI, MLN), DEXs (KNC, RUNE, SUSHI, UNI), lending/borrowing (AAVE), and derivatives (SNX) created the strongest subset of returns across any other sector of digital assets.      Moreover, the strong DeFi returns did not stem purely from platform growth. Much of it can be attributed to our other prediction, “structured tokens and enhanced tokenomics.” The flexibility of token structures has allowed token issuers to change the rules and enhance the features that come with owning a token and participating in the network. While this can be scary from a legal standpoint since you don’t always know exactly what you are getting at the time of investment, it’s also invigorating from an investing standpoint because it allows good teams who issue tokens to continue to tweak the value accrual model until they get it right.      And boy are they ever. From Compound (COMP) and the liquidity mining revolution, to Synthetix (SNX) and its velocity sink, to Uniswap (UNI) and its fair decentralized launch, to revamped incentive structures rewarding governance at Kyber (KNC) and Aave (AAVE) ... Token issuers are scrambling to introduce new models that enhance the value for both users and investors. We applaud this evolution.    Prediction #2: Sports and other live events will play a huge part in blockchain’s success as the “live, in-game experience” and will be enhanced via digital tickets, voting rights and player engagement.    We had no idea sports would be shut down in 2020, but I’m not sure it would have changed the outcome. Our thesis regarding the “digitization of the fan experience” was taking form with or without the ensuing lockdown. The in-game experience was already dying at the hands of interactive, at-home engaged fan experiences, and COVID-19 was simply the nail in the coffin.      We went into great detail discussing “Fan Engagement Tokens” (FTOs) from Socios (CHZ) earlier this year, and the successful issuance of digital assets tied to voting rights and decisions affecting major sports clubs. We’re also seeing a rise in digital baseball cards and digital collectibles as well as tokens backed by the salaries of athletes.      See also: The Inevitable Marriage of Yield Farming and NFTs, Explained      Additionally, the “digitization of the fan experience” is extending beyond sports into other areas like music and entertainment. While there are not a lot of pure play ways to express this theme yet today, we continue to expect more opportunities to come in the near future.    Prediction #3: More M&A, the Bitcoin halving matters and existing non “crypto-native” companies will issue tokens.    Let’s check in one-by-one to see how we did:      More mergers between pick & shovel companies, often at distressed levels. From Coinbase assuming Tagomi, to Binance going on a spending spree, to Voyageur acquiring LGO, M&A is in full force as the leading service providers take advantage of the oversaturation of smaller platforms that never achieved solo success. Several of these transactions were more takeunders than takeovers given the lack of progress or success of the acquirees. We did not anticipate the recent wave of DeFi “fake-quisitions,” but are encouraged by the idea of combining user bases and developers to build DeFi conglomerates.      The Bitcoin halving, while telegraphed and understood, will still be a huge driver of digital asset growth. While the halving itself, as expected, did basically nothing for bitcoin’s price in real time, the consistent monetary policy and limited fixed supply has attracted new players. Once that happened, we have been witnessing a supply shortage. From Paul Tudor Jones to Jim Simons, and more recently MicroStrategy, Square, Stan Drukenmiller and more, the cavalry is clearly coming and they are fighting over a small pie.      Existing non-crypto native companies will utilize tokens. While this is being held back by a lack of regulatory clarity and a lack of investment bankers, it’s happening, slowly. For example, both Reddit and Atari issued tokens. While these are just small examples, the world is beginning to recognize that tokens can be utilized in a company’s capital structure as complements to debt and equity.      We expect more of this in 2021 and beyond, as every company with a subscription model (Netflix, ESPN, gym memberships) or a consumer customer model (restaurants, airlines, internet shopping) will recognize that tokens are the greatest capital formation and customer bootstrapping incentive mechanism we’ve ever seen.    What did we miss in 2020?    We’ll be out soon with our 2021 predictions, many of which stem from budding 2020 events that we either did not foresee or grew faster than anticipated. A few things we have our eye on:    Bitcoin has graduated from “digital assets playground” to “mainstream global investment.” Investors now have the knowledge and means to buy bitcoin themselves, and we are seeing it in real time, which happened quicker than we anticipated. Very soon, investors will specifically seek out digital asset hedge fund strategies that don’t own any bitcoin, as they want fund managers to give them exposure to assets that they can’t buy themselves, or don’t know exist. As a result, there is a good chance that actively managed hedge funds and passive indexes built around high allocations to bitcoin have a very short shelf life.  Banks and broker/dealers are scrambling right now to ""cover bitcoin"" – meaning research on publicly traded securities like GBTC, MSTR, Hut 8, SQ, GLXY and pretty soon the anticipated IPOs of Coinbase and Digital Currency Group (CoinDesk’s parent). Soon, these banks and BDs will realize the real opportunity is investment banking fees from underwriting new tokens issued by traditional companies rather than trying to extract a piece of the bitcoin trading pie.  We anticipated a rise in DeFi, but not to the extent and degree with which it occurred. Decentralized governance is now less about ideology or risk transfer and more about capitalism. Historically, there has been nothing in digital assets worth governing, but now DeFi protocols are generating real revenue, and that is worth fighting over. While 2017 tokens were about fundraising a dream, 2020 and beyond tokens are about aligning incentives amongst stakeholders (founders, developers, customers), and tokens are proving to be the best instrument for fostering this growth.  Community issued tokens (LINK, CEL, SUSHI, YFI) are growing faster than VC-backed tokens (COMP, ATOM, FIL, UNI). This not only suggests that the reliance on VCs may be reduced, but it also may have structural consequences. To date, “show me” stories with high upside but low probability of success have dominated the digital assets landscape, but as VC-backed pipe dreams dissipate, we may see a resurgence of value – those tokens issued by projects and companies that are already having success rather than those that might one day grow into success.    After a whirlwind 2020, we look forward to seeing what 2021 holds.",POSITIVE,BTC | UNI,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | UNI,Jeff Dorman,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/19/what-this-digital-asset-investment-firm-missed-and-capitalized-on-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d5a80ddd26c3235a6dc72e9fd9a2564b40d17a1d-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42405599,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAedWMI,1608380600,The Pandemic Turbocharged Online Privacy Concerns,"In recent years, concerns about digital threats to individual privacy have been growing more acute. From high-profile data breaches to hijacked doorbell cameras, we’ve seen a steady increase in the scale and volume of privacy-related incidents. But 2020, driven by a global pandemic and worldwide protests calling into question the surveillance powers of governments, was a turning point.      In 2021, battles over the future of online privacy – and therefore the nature of the internet itself – will come to head. They will be contested in the spheres of law and programming, and they will center on the two essential components of a robust, resilient privacy solution: end-to-end encryption and decentralization.    This post is part of CoinDesk's 2020 Year in Review – a collection of op-eds, essays and interviews about the year in crypto and beyond. Steven Waterhouse is the CEO and co-founder of Orchid, a privacy tool built on Ethereum designed to let people explore the internet freely.  Privacy and the pandemic    The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic early this year immediately turbocharged concerns around digital privacy. Millions around the world suddenly found themselves working from home, reliant on digital tools like the Zoom video conferencing app.      Mishaps began almost immediately, ranging from the comical to the frightening. For many people, the dangers of the internet became real for the first time. For someone like me who has spent a career focused on issues of digital privacy, these were charged days. At Orchid, we even provided free VPN service to journalists to help ensure they were able to safely report on the unfolding crisis no matter where in the world they might be.    For systems to be private they should be end-to-end encrypted and decentralized.    While millions of individuals were learning firsthand the internet’s privacy pitfalls, governments scrambled to identify ways to track and stop the spread of the virus. Policy recommendations included mass-scale tracking and tracing of people and their whereabouts, and even “immunity passports” for those who had recovered or – in the future – been vaccinated against the disease. I wrote earlier this year arguing that the coronavirus presented a golden, maybe irresistible, opportunity for governments to enhance their powers of surveillance and coercion.    An uncertain future    Discussions around and threats to online privacy lie at the intersection of law and technology. Demand for privacy is surging: People around the world in 2020 flocked to privacy tools such as VPNs and encrypted messaging services. It’s no surprise that tech companies from Apple to Venmo to Telegram increasingly tout “encryption” as a key benefit for their users.      This year saw important developments in privacy law as well. Around the world, regulations aimed at strengthening privacy protections for individuals were adopted, most notably California’s Proposition 24. The law, passed by statewide ballot measure, strengthens provisions in the state’s California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) regulating the data collection practices of online businesses.      See also: California’s Prop. 24 Could Be a ‘Silver Lining’ for Crypto Exchanges Looking to Comply With GDPR      In spite of public sentiment toward strengthening online data protections, there are important counter currents that threaten the technological foundations of privacy altogether. In 2020, governments around the world intensified efforts to hobble end-to-end encryption by requiring technology companies to provide authorities with “back door” keys that would allow them to decipher any content they asked for.    Decentralization plays its part    In 2021, these debates surrounding digital privacy will intensify. And decentralization, in the form of blockchains and the digital assets they enable, must play a key role in supporting end-to-end encrypted privacy solutions.      End-to-end encryption is absolutely essential for true digital privacy. Once an ISP or a web server can see the content of our communications, that information is out there forever, no matter what other safeguards are in place. But systems with strong encryption can still be vulnerable to a single point of failure. If you use a VPN that suffers a leak, or gets hacked or secretly logs your activity, your privacy can evaporate in a second.      That’s why for systems to be private, they should be end-to-end encrypted and decentralized. By distributing processes across many different nodes, they reduce the risk to the user should one, or even several, fail or be compromised. Networks that are end-to-end encrypted but centralized remain subject to the risk that they will be compromised or even shut down in the future.      See also: Cryptocurrencies Have ‘No Way’ to Comply With US Anti-Encryption Bills      In 2021, decentralization’s role in supporting end-to-end encryption will become more important than ever. While end-to-end encryption will remain the sine qua non of digital privacy, decentralization will play a crucial role in ensuring its resilience and making sure that privacy systems are not only effective but resilient.",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Steven Waterhouse,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/12/19/the-pandemic-turbocharged-online-privacy-concerns,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b1b855146ed74f809e6916b6930ab3905c0896a-1420x916.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
