42400300,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIbd,1503959894,$160 Billion: Cryptocurrency Market Sets New All-Time High,"Investment in cryptocurrencies continues to increase.  Spurred by increases in investment, the total value of the more than 800 publicly traded cryptocurrencies and crypto assets pushed past $160 billion for the first time ever, according to data provider CoinMarketCap.  With the move, the figure is now up 1,500 percent from the $10 billion observed at the start of the year.  Notably, the new high was set even as bitcoin, the market's largest asset, continued its recent pattern of sideways trading, hovering in the $4,400-range, or about 1% below its all time high of $4,522.13 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Similar, ether and bitcoin were mostly flat on the day's trading.  At press time, it seemed most of the growth in the top 10 cryptocurrencies was consolidated to two assets, with Ripple's XRP token and monero's XMR token rising 9% and 7.9%, respectively, over the last 24 hours.  On XMR's increase, the asset regained a spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization after some time out of the spotlight.  Elsewhere, investment in litecoin appeared to cool after it set all-time highs earlier in the day's trading. After rising past $60 for the first time since the protocol was introduced in 2011, the token was down nearly 2%.

42400309,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIiW,1503949217,SEC Warns Public Companies Are Using ICOs to Pump Stocks,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission is warning investors about the risk of public stock scams that use cryptocurrencies as a promotional tactic.  Published earlier today, the SEC investor alert primarily focuses on cryptocurrency-themed promotions from publicly traded companies, rather than startups or project teams who aren't listed on an exchange or over-the-counter marketplace. The agency specifically highlights the promotion of initial coin offerings (ICOs), in addition to general cryptocurrency releases, as potential warnings signs for investors.  The SEC said in its alert:  ""Fraudsters often try to use the lure of new and emerging technologies to convince potential victims to invest their money in scams. These frauds include 'pump-and-dump' and market manipulation schemes involving publicly traded companies that claim to provide exposure to these new technologies.""  Indeed, the SEC has ordered stock trading freezes for a number of companies, including three in the past month alone. Whether the agency is pursuing some kind of concerted effort remains to be seen.  As CoinDesk reported late last month, the SEC unveiled the results of its investigation into The DAO, including its determination that tokens sold in conjunction with the failed ethereum-based funding vehicle constituted securities. What's more, the agency indicated that other token sales may fall under this definition as well.  Since that release, other securities regulators, including those in Canada and Singapore, have issued similar statements as well – in effect stating that some tokens are subject to regulations while others may be not.  Commenting on today's release, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research for the nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center, called the SEC's move ""very reasonable and measured,"" framing it as part of the wider process that began in July.  ""This kind of continue in the vein of the SEC taking very reasonable and measure d steps to deal with investor protection issues around ICOs,” he told CoinDesk. ""It's not like a bombshell just dropped and they went after a giant and successful open-source project. Quite the opposite, this is pretty narrow.""  Other commentators see today's release as only the next leg in a longer process.  “We are seeing much more focused interest in digital assets by the SEC, including the recent DAO Report of Investigation and trading suspensions,"" said Perianne Boring, president of the industry trade group Chamber of Digital Commerce. ""The SEC has become an aggressive player in enforcement in the digital currency and token space, particularly in the area of ICOs,"" she said, adding:  ""We anticipate more to follow from the SEC.”  Alert sign image via Shutterstock",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2017/08/28/sec-warns-public-companies-are-using-icos-to-pump-stocks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6a9c8f2049ae51acbbbfd48c0ef15dcc69556b3d-1500x983.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Headquartered at the National University of Science and Technology in Moscow, the centre will form part of a broader digital initiative being undertaken within the Russia government at the behest of Russian president Vladimir Putin. The government offices involved are the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media.  In statements, VEB chief Sergei Gorkov indicated that the research effort would ultimately lead to possible investments in development of the tech – a suggestion that could lead to the development bank throwing its financial weight behind a blockchain project someday.  He said of the centre launch:  ""In September, we will open the first centre focused on blockchain, convergent, and quantum technologies at the National University of Science and Technology (MISIS). We plan to create a group of investment funds with external financing from both Russian and foreign investors.""  VEB has struck an openly enthusiastic tone about blockchain tech, in the past, having announced a plan to work with the Russian Ministry of Health earlier this summer. The announcement coincides with a three-day blockchain event in Tatarstan that began this weekend, at which officials from VEB are in attendance. That event also features ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin as a speaker.

42400312,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJImS,1503939856,Bitcoin Short: ETF Firm Rex Eyes Downside Potential With Fund Filing,"A new bitcoin investment fund launched last week in the US is part of a wider strategy that includes a planned effort to offer institutional investors a way to short the market.  Last week, CoinDesk reported that REX ETF, an investment firm based in Connecticut, had launched a fund that plans to invest primarily in bitcoin futures and other derivatives without actually buying direct exposure to the cryptocurrency. In announcing the move, REX indicated that it would seek to launch multiple investment products built around the tech.  Additional public filings reveal that at least one of those products is already in the pipeline.  According to a filing  from last week, the ""REX Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF"" will be similar in scope – relying on financial derivatives of bitcoin and not the cryptocurrency itself – but with the aim of shorting the market.  When short selling, investors typically borrow an asset or security and sell it in anticipation of a lower buy-in price later, making a profit on the difference.  Here's how the REX ETF filing explains the investment fund's plan:  ""...the Fund will obtain short investment exposure to the price movements of bitcoin through financial instruments that provide short exposure to the price movements of bitcoin, including short positions in and short exposure to futures contracts linked to the price of bitcoin or an index thereof and that are traded or listed in the U.S. (""Bitcoin Futures""). The Fund will be actively managed with respect to the instruments held by the Fund, and the notional value of the Fund's short exposure to bitcoin may vary on each trading day.""  As previously reported, the launch comes amid growing interest in the launch of such products – as well as the hope to capture some of the demand coming from institutional investors.  Options exchanges in the US like CBOE are moving to launch derivatives trades – and others are eyeing the intellectual property that could underlie future offerings as well.

Backing the round are venture capital firms Global Brain, LUN Partners Capital and True Global, according to today's announcement. Based in Singapore and first launched in 2014, Bluzelle is akin to projects like Filecoin or Storj, among others, which use the tech as a means to collectivize and monetize spare storage capacity.  In an interview, CEO Pavel Bains drew on these similarities, and spoke to Bluzelle fitting into a wider array of blockchain-powered technology layers, akin to what Oracle builds on top of the Windows operating system.  ""Different blockchains are complementary systems,"" he told CoinDesk. ""For data storage in a decentralized world we might use ethereum, we might use Hyperledger, or other options as the operating system – and we'll use Bluzelle for the data storage and management.""  The firm has pursued other blockchain initiatives in the past, working on a blockchain-based insurance app for KPMG, as well as assisting in Deloitte's integration of the Ripple distributed payment system.  Looking ahead, the startup is eyeing the launch of an initial coin offering (ICO) sometime in October. The Bluzelle Tokens, in turn, will serve as the basis for the incentive system underlying the community of hardware operators that actually put up their data capacity for rent.

42400313,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJInR,1503932382,Bank of England: DLT Shift Could Lead to New Securities Monopolies,"Researchers for the UK's central bank have argued in a new paper that, if left unregulated, securities settlement services built on distributed ledger tech (DLT) could turn into monopolies.  In a new research paper, entitled ""The economics of distributed ledger technology for securities settlement"", Bank of England staffers Evangelos Benos, Rodney Garratt and Pedro Gurrola-Perez posits that such an outcome is a possibility, even if the tech itself brings positive changes to the overall structure of the securities settlement sector.  The authors of the paper reason that, as with the current settlement industries, DLT-based services have the potential to become ""concentrated among [a] few providers]"". Under this scenario, market participants could become more susceptible to price discrimination or inefficient pricing. Service providers, the authors argue, could wind up ""capturing much of the market surplus"" simply because the industry itself is more naturally susceptible to monopolistic structures.  That said, the research paper does strike a cautiously optimistic tone, positing that the tech could rewrite how the settlement process works for those involved in its day-to-date operation.  The authors wrote:  ""...DLT has the potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs in securities settlement, but the technology is still evolving and it is uncertain at this point what form, if any, a DLT-based solution for securities settlement will ultimately take...""  They go on to state that distributed ledgers could ""potentially allow for a complete disintermediation of the whole post-trade process, from security issuance to settlement, enabling a pure P2P transaction structure.""  Indeed, the Bank of England is one of the most proactive central banks on distributed ledger and blockchain technology, and has previously said that it will build the next version of its official settlement system to be compatible with distributed ledger tech.  Notably, the bank's governor, Mark Carney, said in January that the technology could ""reshape"" the banking industry.

42400298,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIZf,1503927019,Bank of Mexico Governor: Bitcoin More Commodity Than Currency,"The highest-ranking official at Banco de Mexico has stated he believes the central bank is unlikely to classify bitcoin as a currency.  According to local news source El Economista, the bank's governor, Agustín Carstens, said that, since bitcoin is not backed by a government or central bank, the cryptocurrency doesn't meet existing definitions of a currency.  Rather, bitcoin should instead be considered more as a commodity, he went on, since ""there is nothing to ensure its accounting in a financial system.""  Due to its potential for anonymity and use in cybercrime, Carstens also urged that bitcoin should be dealt with as an ""issue of cybersecurity,"" arguing that, although financial innovation should be encouraged, it should be done so in regards to the safety of users.  Making his comments during a lecture at Mexican technical university ITAM, the governor emphasized the role of the authorities in fintech, saying that ""technological development in the financial system cannot be the result of innovation alone"", but must occur in tandem with regulation by the financial authorities.  The country's authorities will soon propose legislation to regulate financial technologies, such as cryptocurrencies, he added.  Financial regulation in Mexico is the remit of the finance ministry, while the central bank is responsible for monetary policy and ensuring the operation of the financial system.  As reported by CoinDesk in 2014, the Bank of Mexico has previously clarified that digital currencies are not legal tender in the country, at the time restricting banks from using bitcoin.

42400311,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAcJIlT,1503921645,Damn Strate: Post-Trade Pioneer Monica Singer Is Going Full-Time Blockchain,"Monica Singer has some unfinished business.  When she joined South Africa's central securities depository (CSD), Strate, in 1998, she set out to do more than just convert its antiquated paper-based securities trading system to a faster, more efficient digital one. Singer wanted to cut out unnecessary middlemen, facilitate peer-to-peer transactions and do it all online. But the technology of the time just wasn't up to the task.  Now, Singer, who has been the CEO of Strate for over 18 years and helped found the organization, thinks blockchain has changed that equation, and she's ready to take action.  On Thursday of last week, she formally resigned her leadership role at the company to dedicate her career to bringing blockchain to industries from finance and insurance to medicine and retail.  Since then, Singer said she's focused on responding to the last of her emails, completing final administrative tasks and taking decades-old colleagues out for bittersweet farewells. After that process is completed on August 31, though, Singer said she will embark ""full time"" on her new role in blockchain.  In her first conversation with the media since her resignation, Singer explained how she believes the tech could help her finally cut out what she describes as ""unnecessary middlemen.""  Singer told CoinDesk:  ""I’m so in love with blockchain, that the only thing I’m doing, all the time, is telling the world, 'Guys, wake up! This is coming, and this is going to change the world.'""  To formally cut ties with her old responsibilities, Singer said she also intends to resign from every advisory board on which she currently sits, save a few non-profits dedicated to serving the people of South Africa.  From there, she plans to relocate from Johannesburg, where Strate and many of South Africa's banks are headquartered, to Cape Town.  Blockchain roadmap  While Singer doesn't yet have any formal plans to launch a new company of her own, or join an existing firm, she does have a two-pronged plan of attack.  Firstly, she's not planning on giving up on CSDs. While she argued that they will ""not have a role to play"" in a blockchain world, she believes that the services CSDs provide will still be needed in this new economy.  ""I promise them that in my search, which I'm going to do full time, I will find a new role for them,"" she said.  Secondly, she intends to leverage a global network of contacts to expand her sphere of influence beyond the financial sector.  ""I love saying to people ... 'Give me a brief description of your industry',"" she said. ""I can quickly tell them in which way that industry will be affected by this new, incredible technology. So, that's what I need to do.""  While her future role is not yet 100 percent clear, some concrete plans are already in place.  Specifically, she's scheduled to speak at the Sibos banking conference in October on blockchain in the cash and securities settlement space. Then, in November, she plans to speak at the World Federation of CSDs in Hong Kong.  Looking ahead, she lists ethereum startup ConsenSys and digital ledger startup Ripple among the ""fintechs"" she's interested in working with as she charts her new course.  ""I was the person who moved South Africa’s financial markets from paper to digital,"" said Singer, concluding:  ""When I discovered blockchain, I thought this is exactly what we need in the world.""

Card Giant China UnionPay Files New Blockchain Patent,"China UnionPay, the payment card giant, hopes to patent a system for connecting a network of ATMs using blockchain technology, public records reveal.  Documents released late last month by the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China details a concept by which a group of ATMs acts as nodes within a blockchain-powered network, sharing transactions through a distributed database in a bid to achieve a higher degree of security and uptime.  According to the patent application, the concept aims to solve a key problem: ""ensuring the security of transactional information"" despite having to rely on a limited amount of data coming from a single point of communication that could be prone to attack or disruption.  As the application explains:  ""According to the present invention, the server can synchronize all the information directly as the monitoring node, facilitate the aggregation of the transaction information, and perform the predetermined processing on the transaction information by using the asymmetric encryption algorithm, thereby ensuring the security of the transaction information.""  Whether China UnionPay is looking to put this intellectual property to commercial use remains to be seen, as the company has to date not commented on this potential use case for the tech. The application, first published in late July, was initially submitted to SIPO in January.  China UnionPay, which operate's the world's largest payment card network, has worked with blockchain in the past, as previously reported by CoinDesk. Last September, the card giant revealed that it was pursuing a consumer loyalty points project in conjunction with IBM.

42379817,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Koyz,1503914410,Third in a Month: SEC Moves to Halt OTC Trading for Bitcoin Firm,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has ordered a temporary freeze on trading for a publicly listed bitcoin exchange company.  On August 24, officials for the securities markets regulator announced a trading suspension for American Security Resources Corp. (ARSC), effective until 11:59 am ET on September 8, 2017.  The company – which has changed hands several times, according to existing SEC filings – declared at the start of this month that it would move to launch a cryptocurrency exchange, moving to rebrand as the Bitcoin Crypto Currency Exchange Corporation.  It was those statements and others issued at the time that appear to have sparked questions from the SEC, according to the August 24 order.

42379810,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8Koov,1503910801,Submarine Sends: IC3's Plan to Clamp Down on ICO Cheats,"Anticipating a sell-out initial coin offering (ICO), a crypto-enthusiast is patiently waiting to send a purchase over the blockchain when the ICO begins.  As soon as it does, he broadcasts the transaction over the network, but it doesn't go through. He tries again. And again. Still nothing.  On Reddit, other users are furious. They lament. Why weren't their transactions being picked up? Project corruption? Bigger whales?  New research suggests the biggest threat to a fair token sale may be miners.  Tasked with organizing the transactions that go into each block, miners, it seems, have found themselves in a powerful position in regards to ICOs – one that could be quite lucrative for them at the expense of users.  Defining the problem  The practice is called ""frontrunning,"" and it's alleged to occur when mining pools detect large volumes of transactions being used for the purchase of new tokens. Rather than treat the transactions as any other, they instead cut the line.  And in ICOs where demand is high, transaction ordering can mean the difference between a successful bid at retail prices, and being stuck with a higher price tag later. That's because if the token sells out while there's still demand, the miners can then resell the tokens on a secondary market at a premium.  It's an ingenious hack, but a tough one to pull off.  Everything has to be just right, the ICO can't sell out in one block, and it can't have too long a time frame for buys, either, like tokens that haven't garnered much interest and so don't sell out at all. The sweet spot: selling out in 20 to 30 blocks.  And that's not all. Not only does the mining pool have to reorganize transactions so its own are in the next block to be found, it would also have to win the block race to verify that block. Because if they didn't, the mining pool that verified the block would be able to see the reorganization and call fraud.  It's risky. But yet, there's evidence, or at least, speculation that it's happened.  In June this year, it was alleged that China-based F2Pool created addresses to purchase tokens from the Status ICO, and that those addresses were the only ones mined in a block published by the pool.  Camouflaged transactions  Widespread or not, the idea that some ICOs not be fair has nonetheless sparked the interest of researchers, and Cornell's Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Contracts (IC3) has come up with a possible solution.  In a blog post released today, the noted blockchain research outfit will outline what it's calling ""submarine sends"" – a potential solution to ICO frontrunning.  While technically dense, Phil Daian, an IC3 researcher who co-authored the paper with Lorenz Breidenbach, Ari Juels and Florian Tramer, explained the process more colloquially: submarine sends obfuscate transactions so they appear like any regular ethereum transaction going to a brand-new address.  Because miners aren't able to see the amount being sent, what contract is being used and what the recipient address is, they'll order the transaction in the block and lock it in. And only then will the specifics of the transaction be made public.  Daian told CoinDesk:  ""Let's say you're on an exchange, and want to put in a market order of a half a bitcoin for the purchase of ether, and some miner puts in their transaction in front of you. They buy ether at a lower price, and then you buy ether at a higher price, and then the miner sells right away and makes a profit.""  And this is exasperated in ICOs that have caps on the amount of tokens being sold, since, after the ICO has closed, ""tokens start trading right away at a higher price, driven up by scarcity,"" according to Daian.  He pointed to the 0x ICO, saying that although it doesn't seem like frontrunning was a problem there, the sought-after tokens sold for about five times their initial price on secondary markets after the ICO ended.  Daian, like many others in the community, don't have much sympathy for miners, who already make thousands per successful block. But like most things in the cryptocurrency world, it's hard to prove abuse.  ""There's some small scale examples where [miner frontrunning] looks pretty probable. But it's always hard to prove anything in a system without real identity,"" Daian said.  Spotting bad actors  Rick Dudley – an IT consultant and CEO of Vulcanize Inc., which provides consultancy and security audits for decentralized applications – seconded Daian's comment with the caveat that it depends how flagrant the miners are when trying to take advantage of their position.  For instance, he described how in some ICO sales, frontrunning is possible to detect by observing the ""mempool"" (the area where transactions sit unconfirmed waiting to be put in blocks). Here, Dudley said, he's observed situations in which transactions that were supposed to go into the next block were skipped over for transactions that seemed to suddenly appear out of thin air.  While the mining pool has plausible deniability (it could be that there was a bug in the system), if this transaction skipping continues to happen, Dudley said it's an obvious warning sign of frontrunning.  During the F2Pool instance, it's speculated that the mining pool developed software, not to reorder transactions, but to reject transactions that were not on their ""whitelist,"" and to only pick up transactions from specific addresses (ones it had created).  According to Daian, users were able to look inside those blocks and see that trend, especially since most of the blocks F2Pool mined were nearly empty.  Software that works off a whitelist, Daian continued, is much easier to build than the software necessary to reorder transactions.  ""There's a large amount of technical knowledge you'd need to have to do this. And most miners are not also programmers,"" he said.  It would take both time and money to create something like this, and because volume is still relatively small, the reward isn't big enough for most miners to saddle the burden, he said.  Daian added:  ""If you wanted to quantify the problem, I wouldn't say it's a high percentage of ICOs that are being affected.""  Bigger problem ahead?  But if miner frontrunning hasn't become a huge problem just yet, many suspect it could become one.  ""There's not enough volume going through the network to warrant a solution, but it's a legitimate threat,"" said Dudley.  But whether it's a pressing issue affecting lots of users might not be at the heart of why this attack is important.  Indeed, the ability for miners (and other actors with other attacks) to game the system could signal immaturity in a market many have touted as a way to disrupt the venture capital industry. And there's interest in finding solutions before the market matures.  Paper co-author Breidenbach seconded that sentiment, saying: ""As volume increases, the important point is that this will happen in the future.""  The IC3 group has already written code aimed to tackle frontrunning, though it's still experimental and not yet ready to be released to the public.  As for why the the researchers decided to outline their solution now, Breidenbach said:  ""From a research perspective, we see this issue and want to propose solutions before it becomes a big problem.""

42379832,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KpCp,1503907227,"Annyeong Bitcoin: South Korea, Canada and a Changing Crypto Market","Cryptocurrencies are a unique financial asset class.  For one, they do not simply live within national borders. They trade frictionlessly around the globe, and, whether you live in America or Armenia, Canada or Cameroon, the process of buying, selling and trading cryptocurrencies is essentially identical.  And yet the exchanges most investors use for cryptocurrency trading are bound by the regulations of the country in which they're domiciled. Moreover, if trade volume in a single country is high enough, it's likely that the market structure of that country's exchanges, and, by extension, that country's regulatory regime, could have a price impact on cryptocurrencies.  Korea rising  Looking back on last week's market action, there's perhaps no better country that illustrates this truth than South Korea, where lawmakers are close to following Japan in becoming the latest to formally carve out rules for bitcoin in national law.  Perhaps in response, Korea's markets are waking up – big time.  Ripple  Last week, investors in Ripple's native XRP token saw their positions nearly double when the price exploded, flirting with a $0.30 price level, a jump in price of roughly 90 percent from the previous week's low.  While the price of XRP was taking off, more than 70 percent of its trade volume was being transacted on South Korean exchanges. In fact, three of the top four exchanges by trade volume were located in South Korea, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  To put that massive South Korean volume share in perspective, on Friday about 7 percent of bitcoin volume was executed on South Korean exchanges, with only one South Korean exchange, Bithumb, ranking in the top 10 for bitcoin volume.  Another way to understand the significance is to compare South Korea's share of the Ripple trade volume to the prior week's aggregate numbers.  During the week of Monday, August 14, as XRP's price remained range-bound between $0.15 and $0.17, its trade volume remained flat, peaking just above $200 million.  But last week, as Ripple was near its high of almost $0.30, the dollar volume shot up to $2.25 billion – more than 10 times the high volume mark of the previous week, and more than 40 times the prior week's low.  Bitcoin cash  Two weeks ago, a similar trend was observed with bitcoin cash, as a significant rise in its price was correlated with a spike in South Korean trade volume.  On August 18, as bitcoin cash flirted with its all-time high, the trade volume was especially dramatic in South Korean won-denominated trading.  On that afternoon, about $1.2 billion of the $2 billion in total bitcoin cash volume, around 56 percent, appeared to be transacted on just three South Korean exchanges – Bithumb, Coinone and Korbit, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  The following day, August 19, bitcoin cash hit a new all-time high of $1,091.97.  In contrast, the same three exchanges, reflected only 6 percent of the total volume in bitcoin during a similar time frame. Using the comparison between the two cryptocurrencies as a baseline, bitcoin cash trading in South Korean won appears over 900 percent higher by volume.  Monero  But if this cause-and-effect relationship wasn't clear yet, just this weekend, the process would again repeat with another cryptocurrency called monero.  Not only did the price of monero set new all-time highs when Korean trading went live, it also saw a massive spike on the announcement that trading would be offered by a local exchange. In fact, it almost doubled overnight on the news Korea's traders would now have an opportunity to buy.  Overall, the value of XMR has tripled since the market first came online, rising to a new high above $140 on Sunday. Given the staggering results, it seems crypto traders would be wise to pay attention to won markets (and regulatory fluctuations) for some time.  Classifications in Canada  But whereas South Korea's trading volume was evidence of growth in its cryptocurrency markets, a news release from Canada's securities regulators provided an example of how they can still shrug off legal guidance.  The release seemed to affirm Canada will take a similar approach to the U.S. by establishing a distinction between so-called 'securities tokens' and 'utility tokens,' as it seeks to determine how to capture the sale of such tools for blockchain project fundraising.  For those who may not have closely followed the SEC report, released late last month, the main takeaway was this: If a cryptocurrency token meets the criteria set forth in U.S. law for what a security is, the SEC will regulate that token like a security.  The impact on the blockchain asset market, in both cases, however, was minimal.  A week from Canada's announcement, the market for blockchain-based assets used in fundraising was nearly $10 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.  Possible conclusions include the fact such a decision may have already been priced in by traders, or the belief that, given the variety of global jurisdictions available, regulatory arbitrage will continue to propel it no matter what happens within one set of borders.  However, it may also be a sign of a lack of maturity in Canada's markets.  Despite having, at one point, as many as three different exchanges set up to serve domestic customers, none of the top 10 exchanges currently offer CAD trading pairs.  Further, its largest exchange, QuadrigaCX ranks 50th in terms of total volume, trading just $2.4 million in the last 24 hours.
