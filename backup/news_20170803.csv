In a new blog post, GDAX general manager Adam White said that, after initially opting to not support the digital asset that powers the controversial fork of the bitcoin blockchain, the exchange has ""examined all of the relevant issues"" and decided to add support.  Created  this week when a group of miners broke away rom the main bitcoin blockchain, proponents of Bitcoin Cash switched to a new, incompatible software that changed the network's rules, creating two distinct transaction chains.  Though no clear target date was disclosed, White said that GDAX would integrate Bitcoin Cash by January 1, 2018 – though he cautioned that this would only take place ""assuming no additional risks emerge during that time.""  He went on to write:  ""Once supported, customers will be able to withdraw bitcoin cash from GDAX. We'll make a determination at a later date whether or not we will also support trading of bitcoin cash. In the meantime, all customer's bitcoin cash will remain safely stored on GDAX.""  The statement comes as some customers have directed their ire toward Coinbase in the wake of the Bitcoin Cash split, though several legal threats have yet to lead to actual court action.  The statement notably only accounts for GDAX, and makes no mention of Coinbase's plans for its wallet service. Coinbase has previously said that it ""will not support the BCC blockchain or digital currency.""  More clarity could be coming, however. A representative for Coinbase told CoinDesk earlier today that it expects to publish additional details sometime next week.

42379670,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUUL,1501790439,Indian Securities Regulator Reveals Plans to Study Blockchain,"India's securities markets watchdog has announced that it will explore blockchain for potential applications to its regulatory oversight processes.  The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) unveiled a broad fintech initiative today, establishing an advisory committee that will research blockchain and other technologies in the areas of asset management, fundraising and post-trade settlement, among others. Shri T.V. Mohandas Pai, the chairman of education service provider Manipal Global and a former board member of Indian IT giant Infosys, will chair the committee.  Perhaps most notably, the Committee on Financial and Regulatory Technologies (CFRT) will examine whether blockchain could be put to use by SEBI itself, though it's not entirely clear at this point which specific applications will be considered.  SEBI said in its release:  ""[The committee will assess] technological solutions for regulatory functions of SEBI viz. information management and data mining, risk management including cyber security, intermediary supervision, consumer protection, etc. through application of new technological solutions like application of distributed ledger technology, big data, data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine Learning etc.""  The committee, according to the statement, will also play a role in creating a more accommodative working environment for companies working on new products and services.  Echoing other securities regulators, the CRFT will draw up plans for a ""regulatory sandbox"" that is aimed at promoting innovative new technologies in the finance space.  The developments also come as India's government moves toward regulating cryptocurrency activities. Recent reports suggest that at least some officials are pushing for a more restrictive stance, though to date, state officials have yet to reveal any concrete proposals or plans.

42379666,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUO3,1501785004,Think Tank Attacks IRS Subpoena in Coinbase Tax Dispute,"Opposition to the IRS effort to obtain user information from cryptocurrency exchange startup Coinbase is growing.  Earlier today, the libertarian think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed an amicus brief in support of Coinbase, sharply criticizing both the scope and nature of the IRS subpoena, which seeks information on Coinbase customers between the years 2013 and 2015.  The IRS effort dates back to last November, when the tax agency pushed to obtain the records with the stated aim of identifying potential tax cheats. After a US judge initially approved the ""John Doe Summons"", Coinbase and, later, several of its customers pushed back. The agency ultimately went to a different judge, seeking enforcement of that summons, though since then Coinbase and an unnamed customers have fought the effort in subsequent filings.  In the brief, the CEI echoed past criticisms of the IRS subpoena as overly broad. The IRS narrowed its initial request last month, trimming it to cover a smaller subset of users. In a recent filing, Coinbase that the new request would impact as many as 14,000 of its customers.  Perhaps more notably, the CEI argued that the court should quash the summons on the grounds that the IRS should be penalized for overreaching in its initial subpoena.  The group wrote:  ""The IRS's subpoena should be quashed in its entirety, not just narrowed. To do otherwise would reward the practice of issuing overbroad subpoenas as a sort of bargaining position that produces better results for the government than coming to court with a well-framed subpoena in the first instance.""  The CEI also argued that, per Coinbase's user agreement, it can only produce user information to authorities when ""compelled"" to do so – and that Coinbase has the right to counter the summons on the grounds that it is flawed.  In a blog post detailing the submission, CEI vice president Jim Harper reiterated this line of reasoning.  ""That means Coinbase is required to resist invalid subpoenas, as it is doing, and it means that the data is not Coinbase's to give to the government based on an invalid subpoena,"" Harper wrote.

42379668,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8KUQZ,1501778709,Arkansas Farming Cooperative Trials Blockchain to Track Chicken Shipments,"A livestock farming cooperative in Arkansas is taking part in a blockchain product tracking trial.  Grass Roots Farmers' Cooperative, in conjunction with San Francisco-based supplier Golden State Meat Company and UK blockchain startup Provenance, are using the tech to track shipments of poultry.  In a blog posthttps://grassrootscoop.com/blockchain-tech-for-total-transparency/, the cooperative detailed its participation in the project, which it said would lead to tools so that customers can ""learn more about the people who helped craft the final product."" Each case of poultry shipped by the cooperative is stamped with a QR code that can then be scanned and traced to a transaction on the test blockchain.  Cody Hopkins, Grass Roots' general manager, wrote:  ""Our hope is that by telling consumer the stories behind how their food was raised – and by verifying them in a peer-to-peer network—we can integrate trust into relationships that may otherwise be fairly transactional.""  The news is the latest indication that this particular blockchain use case – tracking the movements of physical goods through digital updates – is gaining traction. Earlier this week, word emerged that Australia's largest grain exporter is testing the tech for a similar purpose.

Stox, which launched its sale yesterday, has collected roughly 134,000 ETH as of press time, according to data from Etherscan.  The ICO garnered mainstream attention after Mayweather took to Instagram to promote the ICO, stating that – despite being a US citizen and thus blocked from accessing the sale's website – he was ""gonna make a $hit t$n of money on August 2nd on the Stox.com ICO.""  A representative for Mayweather did not immediately respond to questions about his promotion of the ICO or his stated plans to participate.  Though the sale is technically still underway, given its 148,000 ETH cap and two-week timeline, the team behind Stox issued a tweet about an hour ago, announcing that they'd hit their goal of $30 million.  ""Please stop sending ETH,"" the message read, though the team later clarified that the sale remains open until the cap is hit.  Though the total number of contributors isn't listed on its website, the Stox team said that it had received backing from 2,500 contributors as of the first six hours of the sale.

42427677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2oZh,1501768812,Startup Incubator Science Could Raise Up to $100 Million in Planned Token Sale,"A startup incubator based in Santa Monica, California, is launching an initial coin offering (ICO) aimed to raise as much as $100 million to support a new blockchain-focused initiative.  As reported by the Wall Street Journal, Science – best known for its early investment in Dollar Shave Club (which was sold to consumer goods giant Unilever last year for $1 billion) – is launching a new incubation program called Science Blockchain, which will be funded by the ICO. Per the Journal, the incubator is reportedly eyeing a range of between $50 million and $100 million, though Science has not officially confirmed this figure.  Though details such as the start date for the token sale aren't immediately clear, the news is the latest sign that the traditional venture capital world is taking note of the new fundraising model and changing the way in which VCs invest in startups.  VC-funded startups are also looking to token sales seeking new ways of raising cash. Messenger startup Kik, for example, (which has raised more than $120 million in VC funding to date), is preparing to launch an ethereum-based token for a planned ICO as part of a wider plan to create a digital services marketplace.  The ICO model is not without its controversies, however. While proponents say it reduces barriers to capital access, critics argue it can serve to perpetuate scams. Further, the spectre of enforcement of securities regulations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was raised with the issuance of a report on blockchain tokens last week.

42427681,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2odh,1501765255,Tokens Can Be Securities? Even ICO Advisors Agree with the SEC,"Last week's U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission report was a watershed in the history of cryptocurrency.  And for those who missed the finer details, the takeaway was clear: the nascent crypto asset class, while certainly exciting and new, is still subject to U.S. securities laws when they function like securities.  Still, in the wake of the report, there's been a wave of opinions issued on the subject. Lawyers, investors, academics – all have had their say. Less vocal have been some of the sector's more active innovators, but they, too, are joining a broad consensus that the guidance is necessary.  Indeed, despite its embrace of the novel funding method, Beverly Hills-based investment bank and advisory firm Argon Group went so far as to suggest it's been aligning its model against this expectation all along.  Speaking at a conference on the subject, Emma Channing, the group's general counsel and interim CEO, went so far as to laud the SEC for the move.  According to Channing, it's uncommon for the SEC to issue guidance at all.  She told CoinDesk:  ""They are in the enforcement business. This is a very thoughtful opening from SEC, which is clearly very sensitive to the activity in the market and to the confusion in the space. We shouldn't assume this [light touch by regulators] will continue.""  On the substance of the agency's guidance, Channing was blunt: ""If you have ownership rights or an income stream, practically speaking, it's an investment.""  Common sense applies  Of course, for those who have been following the burgeoning sector, this insight might not be surprising.  After all, Argon is best known for advising the venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, which issued a token to accredited investors in April, completing what might have been the first large-scale issuance of a token meant specifically to function as a security.  Allowing investors to participate in the upside of Blockchain Capital's venture fund, the key advantage the tokens provide is allowing investors to have liquidity long before more traditional venture capital shares mature.  If we assume that tokens are an investment, the question naturally arises: When are token-based investing strategies worth pursuing – both for issuers and for potential investors?  Channing's take on this question, from the perspective of the issuer's advisor, is instructive. First, Argon doesn't take on what Channing calls ""two-guys-and-a-piece-of-paper"" ICOs.  For the banking firm to consider a company for an ICO, Channing said, it must have an existing product, at a minimum, and an existing team. They also must have, ideally, revenue and profit.  According to Channing, Argon does not believe ICOs are appropriate for companies raising Series A or Series B financing. In some cases, she said, ICOs are appropriate for Series C and Series D rounds.  For this reason, Argon does not believe that ICOs will be the death of VC funding or incubators.  Common sense rules of raising money still apply, Channing added:  ""We don't encourage our clients to raise more than they actually need. If you don't have the use of proceeds worked out ahead of time, those are the kinds of project that are going to lose money – and you're going to get in deep, deep trouble.""  Exchange regulation  A crucial distinction spelled out in the SEC report is that exchanges that trade securities tokens must be either nationally recognized exchanges or regulated as an ATS, or alternative trading system.  This includes ECNs, like Bloomberg Tradebook or dark pool networks, such as Credit Suisse's Crossfinder and Goldman Sachs's Sigma X.  The SEC also raised other important distinctions.  First, the corporate form that an issuing entity uses is not material to the SEC's view of whether a token is a security; if you establish an entity as a foundation instead of an LLC, for example, you are still subject to U.S. securities laws.  The jurisdiction in which the entity is domiciled is also not relevant. Bottom line, according to Channing, is ""if you sell into the U.S., you get caught by U.S. securities laws.""  ""The law firms have advised that if you only accepted crypto [and not cash] you would be protected,"" she said.  This assertion was also invalidated by the SEC report.  Investor risks  Finally, a surprising implication: The SEC report suggests that U.S. purchasers of ICO tokens may also be subject to liability.  To quote directly:  ""Moreover, those who participate in an unregistered offer and sale of securities not subject to a valid exemption are liable for violating Section 5 ... [T]hose who ha[ve] a necessary role in the transaction are held liable as participants.""  The language used by SEC, to a non-technical eye, does not make clear the context or extent of the potential liability that investors may face. This is even more unclear in the U.S., which is now one of the few jurisdictions to have any insight into how regulators will act in the space.  With regard to U.S. residency, it's quite difficult for issuers to digitally filter out residents of the country. As such, Channing positioned this as a challenge ahead, and a sign that the SEC, while providing guidance, could soon seek to exercise its penchant for enforcement.  Channing concluded:  ""Filtering by IP is not enough. Geofencing is not enough. If you're not taking investor addresses and verifying them, it's not enough.""

To help with the integration, the Gibraltar Stock Exchange (GSE) also announced a strategic partnership with a firm called Cyberhub Fintech, which has become a shareholder in the exchange as part of the deal.  ""The investment signals the Gibraltar Stock Exchange's continued commitment to expand its capital markets network and influence in Asia as well as its ambition to become one of the world's first regulated exchanges to fully integrate use of blockchain into its operational processes from ICO to IPO,"" the GSE said in a statement.

42427676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2oXh,1501758026,State Street to Bitcoin Bull: Blockchain Boss Leaves to Launch Crypto Startup,"Institutional investors have a hard road when it comes to buying large amounts of cryptocurrencies.  The market's shallow, unorganized pools of liquidity mean investors looking to buy more than $20 million-worth of a cryptocurrency often find themselves pulling together investments the old-fashioned way – by cold-calling people they know and putting together the order manually.  But, as global banks and accounting firms show increasing willingness to talk about the potential benefits of investing in cryptocurrencies, ex-State Street executive Hu Liang sees a looming problem: he believes that these large institutions will soon be looking to make massive investments in the asset class.  So, earlier this week, Liang left his position as senior managing director of State Street Bank & Trust's Emerging Technologies Center to meet that demand.  As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the platform, code-named ""Project Omni,"" is being designed to serve as ""the first large-scale institutional infrastructure specifically targeted towards crypto assets.""  ""I’m not building a blockchain application,"" said Liang, who has already gathered a core team of founders, and is currently seeking investment.  He explained:  ""I am building a traditional financial services application that can serve the needs of anybody looking to be involved in crypto assets, whether that's holding it for the long term, whether that's trading it for the short term, whether that's transforming it or using it for a rail for something else.""  Liquidity aggregator  This isn't the first time Liang has embarked on a similar venture. Back in 2007, he joined State Street (now valued at $35.8 billion) when his previous employer, another deep liquidity pool, Currenex, was acquired by the bank for $564 million.  In this latest effort, he hopes to pool the available liquidity of exchanges and other sellers, making purchasing cryptocurrencies easier for the new crop of institutional investors he expects to be attracted to the market in the near future.  Liang envisions the company as an infrastructure platform that will provide both software and hardware designed to integrate with investment institutions' existing order management systems and execution management systems.  In this way, he hopes his clients will no longer have to create ""weird technologies,"" as he described the ad-hoc solutions to make large purchases of cryptocurrencies, or pick up the phone to conduct old-fashioned voice brokering, which he says results in lost time and ""generally increased cost.""  The primary customers of the platform will likely include traditional asset management firms, market makers, institutional speculators and anyone who holds a diversified portfolio.  Instead of reimagining the revenue model of traditional infrastructure providers, Liang expects to charge central transaction fees for his platform's services. In the future, he expects to generate additional income from software services and data analytics tools.  Back to bitcoin  Crucial to Liang's decision to build a startup, he said, was a recent shift he has observed in the requests of large institutional investors.  Instead of solely looking to capitalize on the increased efficiency promised by moving aspects of the financial workflow to a blockchain, Liang said those institutions have begun to increasingly want to capitalize on the crypto assets themselves.  That change, he said, is in large part due to the increased market caps of cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin and ethereum, which are capturing the attention of those looking to diversify their portfolios.  But, more widely, it's initial coin offerings (ICOs) that have ""increased the whole value"" of the crypto-asset class.  ""It almost seems like we’ve gone in a circle,"" Liang said. ""Because we started with bitcoin, we extracted this blockchain thing out of it, we went really far down that road figuring out what it is, then all of a sudden, we’re back to the tail again.""  First-mover advantage  As that interest comes full circle, Liang expects the market for this kind of liquidity aggregation infrastructure to be highly competitive, and soon.  At the moment, there appear to be no formal platforms where investors can easily purchase the large amounts of currency Liang said his potential clients are looking for. Yet, individual counterparties such as Genesis Trading, Cumberland Mining and Circle do appear to be able to handle larger value demands and perhaps the Gemini exchange too, if its daily auctions for bitcoin and ether have large-value sellers.  Going forward, Liang hopes to bolster his founding team by partnering with companies and individuals that could help create those liquidity pools by granting them access to various crypto assets, as well as bringing in software providers to help connect with existing financial infrastructure providers.  He concluded:  ""There’s a huge first-mover advantage on this. But in order to meet the needs we already see from all the different customers, we have to build this thing out quick.""

According to The Australian Financial Review, the group – a grain growers' cooperative – is partnering with Sydney-based startup AgriDigital for the pilot project, which aims at using a blockchain-based system to trace the grain's origin and and document its quality.  This supply chain data, the news source noted, can be displayed to potential buyers in the hope of improving confidence in grain stores and, eventually, to boost sales for Australian grain growers who are looking to expand to more competitive markets in Asia.  ""Anything allowing proof of provenance can create value to Australia,"" CBH Group's chief executive Andy Crane told the publication.  The pilot is slated to commence next week at CBH's oats processor, Blue Lake Milling in South Australia. As a next step, the group said it is likely to expand the pilot to include its $4 billion Western Australia granary if the initial phase proves to be successful.  CBH is just the latest organisation to trial the potential of blockchain in monitoring the movement of goods, and other companies worldwide have moved to launch similar pilots in recent months.

42427664,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyL2oBh,1501750816,Broker-Dealer Renews Call for ICO Rules After SEC Release,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has released new guidance on digital tokens and ICOs – but one industry stakeholder wants the agency to go a step further.  As CoinDesk reported back in May, New York-based broker-dealer Ouisa Capital formally petitioned the SEC to release clear rules for issuing blockchain tokens. At the time, the firm also called for the agency to put together a so-called regulatory ""sandbox,"" or a framework in which companies can test new products in a limited setting under supervision.  The SEC made waves on July 25 when it published the results of an investigation into The DAO, the ethereum-based funding vehicle that collapsed last summer following a code exploit. Investigators determined that the tokens issued and sold in conjunction with the DAO were securities, but opted not to press charges.  Perhaps more notable in that release was the SEC's statement that the offering and sale of digital tokens ""are subject to the requirements of the federal securities law,"" though it noted that the determination of whether a particular token constitutes a security is based on its ""particular facts and circumstances.""  It was a decision that many in the industry weren't surprised to see – and indeed, some observers saw the SEC release as a positive development for the sake of clarity.  Yet for Vince Molinari, the CEO of Ouisa Capital, the release doesn't go far enough.  Molinari said in an interview that, based on his discussions with the agency, the SEC has ""been extraordinarily engaging in this process,"" stating that in his view, that publication represents a kind of ""warning shot heard round the world.""  At the same time, Molinari argued for a more formal process, with draft proposals and subsequent feedback from potential stakeholders.  He told CoinDesk:  ""We need formal rule-making here. You can't leave it to facts and circumstances.""  Molinari went on to state that he thinks the SEC will ultimately move in this direction, adding that Ouisa has also renewed its call for a regulatory sandbox.  ""I believe the SEC will take further steps to clarify this, and I think it's really healthy for the environment, for the investing environment and the token environment, so that it has long-term systemic power,"" he told CoinDesk.
