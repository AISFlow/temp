42427297,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Exh,1484940915,Hong Kong Stock Exchange Considers Blockchain Settlement Upgrades,"The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) is looking to blockchain as it begins work on a next-generation transaction settlement system.  The disclosure came during comments given by SEHK chief executive Charles Li, who spoke during a media luncheon earlier today.  In response to a question about market infrastructure changes, Li said that, in addition to retooling its trading platforms, SEHK is weighing options for upgrading its post-trade systems as well. He mapped out a three-to-four year roadmap during which the exchange would seek to both cut costs and reduce risk across the its operations.  As part of that process, SEHK is considering blockchain for possible use.  Li explained to luncheon attendees:  “In 2016 we started to look at the role new technologies (such as cloud computing and distributed ledger) can play in our future development and this will continue in 2017 when we will determine our NextGen roadmap.”  SEHK has been holding exploratory conversations with exchange operator Nasdaq since as early as October, according to the South China Morning Post.  Hong Kong’s central bank has also been testing the tech, noting in a November white paper that blockchain “carries enormous potential”.

Following his inauguration today – not so much.  On 9th November, prices bounced more than 3% as Trump, the controversial businessman and Republican presidential nominee, secured the votes to clinch the election versus former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. That move came as stock markets worldwide sharply fell as Trump's victory became apparent.  The reaction to Trump's inauguration, by contrast, was far more muted.  Data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows that today’s prices have largely stuck to the same track seen in the past few days, primarily staying within the range in the upper $800s.  Prices hit a low of $882.30 at around 10:15 UTC, hours before Trump’s inauguration. The average price of bitcoin is currently $893.61, BPI figures reveal.  At press time, CNY-denominated markets are up more than 5% from the day’s open, hitting a high of ¥6,175.30. CNY markets are reporting an average price of ¥6,129.19, according to the BPI.

42427291,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Elh,1484926251,EU Watchdog: Blockchain Security Should Be Concern For Finance Firms,"Financial firms need to be mindful of cybersecurity challenges as they look to integrate blockchain, a top IT agency for the European Union said this week.  The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) has published a new report on blockchain tech, which seeks to highlight the security challenges that large businesses might experience in the face of broader blockchain adoption. Key management, data privacy and oversight of smart contracts were some of the major items identified in the report.  It's the first time the agency, founded in 2004, has released a major report on the tech. Last year, ENISA published a glossary page on its official website that offered an overview of blockchain, noting at the time that ""it is too soon to tell whether blockchain will live up to its promise"".  According to the new report, executives at financial firms should give due consideration to security as they weigh applications of the tech.  Udo Helmbrecht, executive director of ENISA, said in a statement:  ""Cybersecurity should be considered as a key element in the blockchain implementation by financial institutions.""  Code review and mechanisms for actually accessing distributed networks should also be at top-of-mind, the report goes on to state, while also highlighting that banks should consider the security challenges of handling digital asset wallets.

42427298,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Ezh,1484917225,Ex-Gemini Lawyer: SEC 'Unlikely' to Approve a Bitcoin ETF,"One of the lawyers who helped craft the application for what would be the first-ever bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is doubtful the SEC will approve such a request any time in the near future.  The critique, courtesy of former Gemini general counsel David Brill, potentially cuts deep, as his old employer's last and final deadline to receive approval for the experimental product is on 11th March.  Though Brill is quick to point out he is a “proponent” of the creation of bitcoin ETFs and pro-bitcoin regulation more broadly, the prognosis does not bode well for its success.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Brill explained that he believes factors such as China's impact on the price of bitcoin make an approval unlikely.  Brill said:  ""It seems unlikely, among all the other reasons, that the commission is going to want to move forward with a product where the major trading is done on an exchanges that may not be following our AML guidelines.""  A career lawyer for 20 years, Brill worked at Thompson Financial from 2003 through 2010, when it acquired Reuters.  Prior to departing Gemini last year, Brill worked as the New York-based exchange's general council, where he said he helped create the legal infrastructure of the exchange and craft a number of responses to amendments to its S1 filing.  Though Brill does believe that that a bitcoin ETF will eventually be allowed to do business on a major stock exchange, he said the SEC will be unlikely to do so while as much as 95% of all bitcoin transactions are carried out in China, according to CoinDesk’s Q3 State of Blockchain report.  That, coupled with the China government’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges and anti-money laundering practices, makes for an even less likely approval, he said.  ""It's more that the overwhelming majority of trading is not being done in the US, and being done in an area where the rules and regulations are not consistent with the rules here,"" said Brill.  Bitcoin banks?  Later today, Brill plans to address the members of the American Bar Association (ABA) at its Derivatives and Futures Law Committee Meeting in Florida.  At the committee meeting, he intends to detail his concerns regarding the future of bitcoin ETFs, as well as the potential impact of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's proposed plans for a federal FinTech charter that might eventually give some bitcoin companies bank status.  Similar to his concerns about the approval of a bitcoin ETF, Brill said that while he'd like to see the charter applied to bitcoin exchanges that meet the requirements, he's skeptical this will come to pass.  ""I would say that eventually it could be open for bitcoin companies,"" he said. ""But right now, there are real issues regarding the scope of the charter and some real disagreements between the states, a number of Democratic Senators, and the OCC.""  Specifically, Brill pointed to opposition from individual US states, some of which allege the OCC has overstepped its power, even if the end goal is to make the US more competitive with other nations.  Earlier this week, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, Maria Vullo, submitted a comment letter to the OCC in opposition to the proposed national bank charter for financial technology companies.  Vullo wrote:  ""The OCC should not use technological advances as an excuse to attempt to usurp state laws that already regulate FinTech activities where they intersect with banking and lending, whether depository or non-depository.""  Furthermore, just a day earlier, senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore), wrote a similar letter in opposition to the charter, citing concerns that it would allow the proliferation of ""predatory alternative financial services providers,"" according to American Banker.  Change is coming  Speaking shortly before Donald Trump’s inauguration as President, Brill said he is cautiously optimistic about a more promising environment for bitcoin companies in the future.  From a strictly local business perspective, he predicted Trump would likely take a pro-bitcoin stance.  However, considering concerns about a possible ""trade war"" with China following Trump’s expected policies, Brill said the predominance of bitcoin trading in the nation could be a hindrance.  In his ABA address today, Brill said he intends to speak to a larger trend of creating a more fertile regulatory environment for bitcoin startups.  He concluded:  ""I want to try to see what approaches might work to make it easier for bitcoin companies to expand across the US. Because right now, it is extremely difficult because every state has something different that they want.""

42427301,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1F1h,1484913610,Bid to Connect Ethereum and Zcash Blockchains Reaches New Milestone,"Work on integrating Zcash's privacy-focused tech with ethereum’s distributed applications platform has reached a new milestone.  According to a blog post by Ethereum Foundation team lead Christian Reitwiessner and Zcash Company engineer Ariel Gabizon, new code has been tested as part of effort to create a means to verify zk-SNARK proofs written in Solidity, ethereum’s smart contract language.  Zk-SNARKS are zero-knowledge proofs that provide a means to shield certain types of data (like who is sending what amount of digital currency), and form a central component of Zcash.  As Reitwiessner and Gabizon wrote:  ""We tested the new code by successfully verifying a real privacy-preserving Zcash transaction on a testnet of the ethereum blockchain. The verification took only 42 milliseconds, which shows that such precompiled contracts can be added, and the gas costs for using them can be made to be quite affordable.""  The idea of using Zcash’s elements to obscure the nature of ethereum transactions has been explored in the past, forming part of what the two organizations call Project Alchemy.  According to Reitwiessner and Gabizon, the effort seeks ""to enable a direct decentralized exchange"" between the two blockchain-based networks.  However, there’s still work to be done. ""Truly achieving the mentioned functionalities – creating anonymous tokens and verifying Zcash transactions on the ethereum blockchain, will require implementing other elements used by Zcash in Solidity,” the pair wrote.

42427288,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1Efh,1484910017,The Industry's Critique of Illinois's Digital Currency Guidance is In,"A planned approach to regulating digital currencies is winning praise from industry participants, public documents reveal.  The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation published its initial guidance in late November as part of a broader push to create a working environment for startups working with the tech (public comments for which the state will be publishing on Monday)  The digital currency guidance notably included language that, if finalized, would apply money transmission rules to companies that exchange digital and government-issued currencies, leaving firms that only deal in digital currency outside of those requirements. Elsewhere, the state said that digital currencies wouldn't be considered 'money' under the state’s Transmitters of Money Act, or TOMA.  Still, published comments reveal that some are questioning elements of the release. That said, the approach being taken by Illinois drew wide support from those who responded to the state’s request for comment.  Peter van Valkenburgh, director of research at the non-profit advocacy firm Coin Center, wrote:  ""This is an extraordinary approach, particularly in light of the increasingly convoluted landscape of state-by-state money transmission licensing and the emergence of premature and mis-calibrated digital currency licensing regimes that can stifle innovation here in the US without offering concomitant benefits in consumer protection.”  Others who submitted comment include the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Illinois-based Fornaro Law, among others.  'Mining' definition questioned  While supportive, some commentators took aim at the guidance depiction of mining, or the process by which new transactions are added to some public blockchains.  Blockchain Consulting Group founder Taylor Gerring wrote that, as currently written, the description that all cryptocurrencies rely on mining as it is carried out on the bitcoin network falls short of the truth.  ""More generally, this process can be seen as 'validation' since the participants ('miners') are working to finalize the information as quickly as possible, which each subsequent validation provides increased assurances the information will not be reverted,"" he wrote.  Conversely, Gerring went on to state that the process by which new coins are created also differs from cryptocurrency to cryptocurrency.  ""Although bitcoin is famous for its limit of 21 million bitcoins released at a rate that halves every approximate four years, it is not a strict requirement that new units of currency are generated this way,"" Gerring explained.  Suggested changes  Other commenters suggested that Illinois think deeper on some of the issues that its guidance raises.  For example, Chamber of Digital Commerce president Perianne Boring wrote that the state should consider relaxing application requirements for Illinois-based startups looking to break into the digital currency space.  Boring wrote:  ""To the extent the Director has the authority to waive portions, if not all, of the application requirements for digital currency companies who are deemed to trigger the licensing requirement in Illinois, such a consideration will prove beneficial to market growth and innovation in a strategic state such as Illinois.""  Philip Fornaro, principal attorney for Illinois legal firm Fornaro Law, suggested that the state consider other solutions for regulating the industry instead of TOMA.  He reasoned that the state, in opting to declare that digital currencies lie outside of the definition of money”, shouldn’t impose money transmission regulations on brokers, for example. While some kind of licensure ought to be required, Fornaro wrote, determinations by agencies like the IRS (which deemed bitcoin to be a kind of property in 2014) should be fully embraced by the state.  ""In our opinion, the IDFPR should spend more time observing this emerging market before concluding that the Illinois Transmitters of Money Act is the most appropriate regulatory framework by which to regulate the use of digital currency,"" Fornaro wrote.

42427275,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyK1B7h,1484906739,Blockstream Makes its Case for Bitcoin-Powered Private Blockchains,"Private and public blockchains, normally siloed both technologically and culturally, could become more intertwined if a new effort by bitcoin startup Blockstream gets off the ground.  The venture-backed firm is best known for iterating on top of the open-source bitcoin protocol with projects such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, the latter of which aims to allow users to send assets back and forth between blockchains 'pegged' to bitcoin.  At the same time, the startup has been working on more enterprise-oriented projects, perhaps biting into the recent buzz and experimentation with private blockchains that typically have a few known participants managing the system.  The latest announcement finds Blockstream expanding on the next steps for a project called Liquid, unveiled in late 2015.  A sidechain that many bitcoin exchanges have been integrating for faster money transfers, the project has been slow to see wider release – at least compared to the initial rosy projections of a Q1 2016 offering.  But though Liquid is still not yet production-ready, on Wednesday Blockstream released its second white paper, opening up the details of Liquid's model to the public and, possibly, signifying a step towards permissioned sidechains seeing wider use.  Once the code is open sourced, companies will have the means to spin up their own versions of the technology.  Of note is one of the more interesting claims in the paper, one that alleges the approach provides a better alternative to other private blockchains, at least for some use cases.  Blockstream's Alexandre Bergeron told CoinDesk:  ""One of the benefits is that the consensus model is pretty straightforward if you compare it to other offerings in the space. It doesn't take much time to understand.""  He added that other consensus models in the space are ""complex"" and ""not well-studied,"" making it ""difficult to predict how they might react to 'adversarial conditions'"".  Other differences  The project's backers say its so-called 'strong federations' could allow financial institutions to pin certain types of private sidechains to the bitcoin blockchain, in part to take advantage of the network’s security and the control that it gives to users.  In conversation with CoinDesk, Bergeron emphasized that this gives participants another option if the federation goes awry.  ""If they don’t feel like participating anymore, users can return to the main chain and be done with it,"" Bergeron said.  Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician for Blockstream, said that the paper constitutes ""a pile of improvements"" over other systems given the company's experimentation with new bitcoin features such as SegWit and confidential transactions, which shield transaction information, on testing sidechains.  A sidechain using confidential transactions would also potentially be more private than the main bitcoin blockchain, as it stands today.  ""They provide commercial privacy with support for transactions where asset types and amounts are opaque while preserving the public verifiability inherent to bitcoin,"" the announcement blog post reads.  That said, Poelstra stressed that a strong federation needs certain conditions to work properly.  The system requires a ""small, well-defined"" set of participants in order to make the guarantees that sidechains do. He described this state as ""Byzantine robust"".  ""As long as the majority of the participants are acting correctly and adhering to the protocol, then we can prove that the system will continue to move forward and the trades will execute,"" he said.  But, rather than having the bitcoin blockchain secure the network, a group of signers is responsible for validating the transaction history, similar to other private blockchain structures. (The paper further explains how participants are incentivized to do ""the right thing"").  As far as how such an arrangement would impact bitcoin, Poelstra explained that the main network remains safe even if such a federation implodes.  ""If there’s anything wrong with bitcoin that would affect the sidechain, but the other direction doesn't apply,"" he said.  Strong federation use cases  So, where might this system be useful?  Bergeron argued that it could provide a more efficient mechanism for prime brokerage, which normally requires a third party to help quickly move, say, $1m.  ""What Liquid does is it replicates this model, but it removes the custodianship aspect. Participants can commit their funds to the system without requiring a third party to hold and operate the movement of funds between each other,"" he explained.  He continued:  ""To me that’s one very clear example of the efficiencies that strong federations bring to the table.""  On the other hand, Poelstra described it in much broader terms, framing the concept as potentially useful for ""any system where there's a small, fixed set of participants who want to work together contractually, but don't fully trust each other"".  He stressed that it offers other properties, again pointing out the privacy guarantees and the way in which participants can ensure others are playing by the rules, so to speak, while at the same time hiding information (perhaps financial) they wish to keep private.  The 'other' sidechains  Though this might seem like a novel direction for sidechains, onlookers might be more excited about Blockstream’s ""other"" idea for the technology: to allow the means to move tokens between public blockchains with different rule sets without having to trust an intermediary.  This was one idea described in the company's first white paper two years ago. But, they might have a ways to go, as not all bitcoin developers are convinced that current sidechain implementations will uphold the security of the main bitcoin network.  Although bitcoin developer Chris Stewart argued on social media that trustless sidechains are actually ready to be deployed (the code has been put through its paces on a test Elements sidechain), he asserts that bitcoin’s current political climate has perhaps stopped it from being implemented.  Whatever the case, the strong federation system seems to be making some headway.  It's not yet production-ready, according to Poelstra, but when it is, the next step is to open source it ""so that anyone will be able to take that code and use it"".  In this light, he said, the team is releasing the paper in a bid to get feedback from academics and developers as the company looks to chart a strong course forward.
