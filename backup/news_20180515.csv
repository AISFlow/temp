42429077,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdTh,1526420167,Social Investing Platform eToro Expanding Crypto Trading to US,"eToro, the social investing platform, is launching a full-fledged cryptocurrency exchange and mobile wallet and expanding into the United States.  Announced Tuesday, the Israel-based company has opened the waiting list for people in the U.S. who want to trade bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, XRP, dash, bitcoin cash, stellar, ethereum classic, NEO, and EOS.  “Consumers all over the world should have access to the tools they need to participate in cryptocurrency markets, regardless of their expertise,” CEO Yoni Assia said in a press release.  Previously, eToro offered crypto trading only on a very limited basis. For example, in 2014 it introduced contracts for difference (CFDs) in which users could bet on the direction of bitcoin's price without actually touching the cryptocurrency.  Then early last year, the company enabled customers to buy or sell XRP, ether and litecoin on its platform, but it did not allow them to deposit or withdraw cryptocurrencies from their accounts, according to eToro's terms and conditions.  Now eToro plans to launch a true cryptocurrency exchange, plus a corresponding mobile wallet, sometime in 2018. The new exchange will have bonus over-the-counter trading options for institutional investors.  Setting eToro apart from other exchanges, top cryptocurrency traders will be able to reap income by making their portfolios transparent on eToro and allowing other traders to copy their trades.  Crypto copycats  The platform, which also offers trading in traditional assets from stocks to commodities, is perhaps best known for its social features. Similar to networks like Facebook or Twitter, eToro users can follow influential traders and topics with customized news feeds.  Guy Hirsch, eToro’s U.S. managing director, told CoinDesk users can directly message traders they copy, adding:  “If the market is bitcoin, then every time there is a mention about bitcoin by some other user you’ll be able to see that in your news feed. You’ll be able to comment on that, share that or like it. Similarly, you can start a conversation about bitcoin, then other people who have bitcoin on their watch list will be able to see your post.”  Every month, the platform pays select traders out of its marketing budget a sum worth roughly two percent of the trades and gains other users copied. Users can choose to “copy” popular traders with just a fraction of their portfolios, adjusting the amount based on how comfortable they feel with the influencers’ risk level.  Once the cryptocurrency offerings launch in the U.S., eToro will invite top cryptocurrency traders to join this program, which so far has 250 traders, each with thousands of followers copying them.  “We have a lot of success stories about people making a good living, or it is their only source of income,” Hirsch said. “That’s their profession, basically, managing their eToro portfolio.”  According to the eToro team, those popular traders earn $500 to $40,000 a month.  A long-time bull  eToro was founded in 2007, a year before bitcoin was conceived. Yet Assia is no stranger to cryptocurrency.  He helped invent bitcoin’s colored coins, second-layer tokens that predated the ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens favored by today's crowdfunded startups.  eToro has raised $162 million since it launched in 2007, including a recent round in March led by China Minsheng Financial, with support from SBI Group, Korea Investment Partners, and the London Stock Exchange Group’s private placement platform.  The platform boasts 10 million users from 140 countries, from China and Russia to Switzerland and the United Kingdom.  Although Hirsch would not give a timeline for when cryptocurrency options will be available in the U.S., he did say eToro will offer cryptocurrency trading in every jurisdiction in the country.  Broadly, eToro plans to build bridges between traditional financial markets and cryptocurrency communities.  Hirsch said he expects all assets – from real estate to metals, commodities, stocks, intellectual property, and brand equity – will be tokenized over the next decade in a way that lends greater liquidity to those markets through exchanges.  He concluded:  “I believe those will come onto the blockchain. And eToro plans to be a leader in propelling that vision into a reality.”  Image of CEO Yoni Assia via eToro",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BCH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2018/05/15/social-investing-platform-etoro-expanding-crypto-trading-to-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3386f2d8914ef4b3ab6d0a8146dda00dc1398367-1500x1200.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42429076,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdRh,1526416800,US Regulators Say They Want to Avoid 'Hindering' Blockchain Innovation,"U.S. regulators are still looking into cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, but don't aim to suppress the industry, according to comments made during a panel at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference in New York.  Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) enforcement director James McDonald, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Enforcement Division Cyber Unit chief Robert Cohen and associate deputy attorney general Sujit Raman participated in a panel discussion on enforcement activities in the space Tuesday. They were joined by Kiran Raj, chief strategy officer at crypto exchange Bittrex, with the panel moderated by attorney Steve Bunnell.  The government representatives, who disclaimed that they only spoke for themselves and not their respective agencies, notably all agreed that they did not want to hinder innovation or interfere unduly with blockchain or the tokens built on the nascent technology.  That said, they all also stated that they had to act against those seeking to defraud or outright steal from participants in the space.  Cohen and McDonald both said their agencies had ""open-door policies"" for those trying to launch token sales, with Cohen explaining:  ""The SEC has been open about meeting with people from the industry, to come in and meet with the staff, to talk about the ideas you have, the new developments, and have a dialogue about the new technology. The commission encourages ways to raise capital, we don’t regulate the technology – we regulate the financial industry and the markets.""  On actually regulating the space, McDonald noted:  ""Our mission is to foster financially sound markets, and we understand as a regulator that requires a certain amount of [flexibility] in our approach. We’re doing it in a way that doesn’t hinder innovation and doesn’t interfere with other regulatory priorities.""  Raman similarly cited a need to protect Americans as the focus for any actions taken by the Department of Justice, saying:  ""The number one priority for the Department of Justice is to keep people safe. One concern we have for the larger virtual currency space is large sums of money are flowing through the market without touching financial institutions … From a national security perspective or an anti-money laundering perspective, that’s something … we have to investigate. As with anything else, it’s a balance but it’s certainly one of our priorities, to know what’s going on.""  When asked about his concerns, Bittrex's Raj pointed to a lack of regulatory clarity surrounding token sales:  ""One of the big pieces of feedback I get … is we need more certainty. One of the main things we get is we hear about fraud … we agree, we don’t want them in the industry. The problem is how do we take guidance and apply it to what you’re doing when it’s so far away from what the fraud people are doing?""  McDonald agreed, saying:  ""LabCFTC is providing their expertise to make sure we end up in the best place possible. We’re careful not to be putting ourselves out there in the same way that the policy divisions would be but the policy divisions are having conversations with market participants.""  However, Cohen said the SEC has released guidance on tokens, saying:  ""The main issue is whether the token or whatever asset you have is a security, and the commission has put out guidance on that. If a firm or person is making a good-faith effort to comply with the law, and one step to that is if they’re talking to regulators, [we’ll work with them].""  For those who do seek to defraud others, Cohen said:  ""It’s clear when people are not making good-faith efforts to comply, and that’s when we step in.""  Read the full rundown on Twitter.

42429082,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdbh,1526413190,Circle Becomes 'Bitcoin Unicorn' with Bitmain-Backed Mega-Round,"The 'bitcoin unicorn' club now has another member.  Announced Tuesday, Circle has closed a $110 million Series E fundraising, a figure that effectively values the startup at nearly $3 billion, according to figures from the company. Led by China-based mining outfit Bitmain, the round includes support from Accel, Blockchain Capital, Breyer, Digital Currency Group, General Catalyst, IDG, Pantera and Tusk Ventures.  With the funding, the company is also revealing an ambitious plan to bolster its products and services by launching a ""US dollar coin,"" or a blockchain native asset that would be both regulated and backed by real government currency, through its affiliate CENTRE project.  In this way, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire framed the round as one that helps it position itself as a true conglomerate of cryptocurrency services, as opposed to just an exchange or payment startup, both characterizations having been given to the company in the past.  Allaire told CoinDesk:  ""A core part of vision is open-protocols that would enable the free movement of value. A real critical piece is there has to be open, interoperable standards for our how fiat money can move over blockchains. That's where fiat stablecoins and payment protocols come into play.""  More than a technical novelty, Allaire positioned the stablecoin project as essential to Circle's maturation and continued expansion, painting it as integral for its mobile payments application, its over-the-counter (OTC) trading business and its exchange service.  The launch also comes at a time when Silicon Valley investors have shown a preference for investments in such products, owing to the massive role stablecoins play in facilitating global cryptocurrency exchange and the perceived issues with today's market leaders.  It's this vision, Allaire said, that made Bitmain, the controversial cryptocurrency mining giant, a natural fit to lead the funding round.  As recently as March, Bitmain co-CEO Jihan Wu had made appearances at major U.S. conferences where he vowed to back high-tech alternatives to central banking.  ""Jihan is a visionary and he is a visionary for changing the global financial order,"" Allaire said. ""They believe in the long-term potential of Circle.""  All told, the funding will also help boost staffing at Circle, which today employs more than 200 employees globally in locations including Boston, San Francisco, Dublin, London, Paris, Madrid, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shenzhen.  A new twist on stablecoins  But while Circle's funding round and valuation are likely to grab a majority of headlines, it's perhaps its launch of a US dollar cryptocurrency initiative with participation from Bitmain that may most impact the crypto market.  As noted by Allaire, the play is a strategic one that finds Circle taking aim at one of the most important elements of the crypto economy.  ""It's a big piece, as we acquired Poloniex and Poloniex was a crypto-only exchange,"" Allaire explained. ""The way people have handled fiat on an exchange like that has been through something like Tether, and we see a lot of weaknesses and challenges with Tether.""  Indeed, Allaire isn't alone, as many commentators have sought to position Tether as a systemic weakness that, through its affiliation with the troubled exchange provider Bitfinex, a company that has struggled with regulatory issues, threatens the integrity of the market.  Yet, it's important to note that Circle will be seeking to take an open approach to its USD-C token, framing it as an open-source project with a more robust governance model.  The vision is that regulated financial institutions, whether they're a crypto exchange or a money transmitter, would be authorized by CENTRE to become issuers of stablecoins, and that many issuers could offer and manage different fiat-backed cryptocurrencies.  ""Circle can be an issuer of US dollar coin, Square could be an issuer. If I got US dollar coins from Circle, I could transmit those to another digital wallet for an issuer,"" he explained.  A foundation for payments  But if all the conversation about exchanges and crypto-plumbing lead to perceptions that Circle is straying from its more consumer-focused products, Allaire was quick to push back.  Rather, Allaire suggested that bolstering the exchange and fiat cryptocurrency ecosystems globally only strengthens products like its original mobile money application, enabling that product to work more effectively at scale in accordance with its original vision.  ""To realize the vision for ubiquitous payments, we need there to be currencies that can be stored, settled and used,"" Allaire continued.  With the funding, the company is also publishing a new white paper on its stablecoin work, as well as an FAQ that will seek to educate others on they can engage in this new market Circle hopes to steward.  Of note in these materials is that all USD-C tokens will be issued on ethereum, a notable detail given the platform's issues in scaling to support its current diversity of users. (The company said more announcements on the project are expected this summer).  Still, the overall message was that this is an effort to bring an opaque offshore market back into the regulated cryptocurrency economy, as Allaire said CENTRE will require members to undergo compliance and balance sheet audits to ensure assets are properly backed.

42429093,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLrdth,1526408405,Blockchain Startup Enigma to Demo 'Secret Contracts' Privacy Tech,"Enigma will conduct the first public demonstration of its privacy-oriented, blockchain-based protocol at CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference on Tuesday.  Former MIT researcher and Enigma co-founder and CEO Guy Zyskind first introduced the technology in 2015, seeking to rebuild the foundational layer of ethereum to address the blockchain's privacy-related shortcomings.  The protocol essentially allows nodes to compute using encrypted fragments of the smart contracts without having to decrypt them, which other blockchains cannot do. Dubbed ""secret contracts,"" it also facilitates ""coin mixing"" – a tactic that obscures the original source of ether used within the protocol.  Likewise, it stands apart from other privacy-guarantee mechanisms like zk-SNARKs in which one party can prove its possession of information to another party without revealing the information or interacting with the other party. Enigma's protocol, on the other hand, uses a trusted execution environment in which the cryptography is relied upon for certainty and neither party has any information on their respective data inputs and outputs.  The company, which plans to launch its test network on June 15, claims that the data privacy furnished by the protocol is crucial for the widespread adoption of decentralized applications (dapps).  In particular, the tech can be utilized for use cases in industries like healthcare and finance that frequently handle sensitive data and must comply with legal measures like the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Co-founder and chief product officer Can Kisagun added in a statement that ""It also solves real-world problems with data sharing, data matching and other important, complex issues facing global organizations.""  Because computations are done off-chain, Enigma argues that the protocol will also enable the use of dapps at a larger scale than current iterations – such as CryptoKitties, for example.  ""With Enigma, decentralized applications will move from novelty to necessity,"" Kisagun claimed.

42380665,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuX5,1526404458,HTC Plans to Ship a Blockchain Phone This Year,"HTC blazed trails in the late 2000s by bringing a smartphone to market based on the Android operating system. Now it wants to do the same with blockchain.  The Taiwanese electronics maker on Tuesday unveiled the Exodus smartphone, which would serve as both a mobile connecting point to the world of decentralized networks and a storage device for those who want to carry their crypto in their pocket.  According to Phil Chen – who previously founded HTC’s Vive virtual reality product line and recently returned to the company to spearhead the Genesis project – the company aims to start distributing the device in short order.  “We're looking to ship by the end of this year,” Chen told CoinDesk.  While HTC isn’t the only company working on a blockchain-dedicated smartphone – Sirin Labs recently raised $157 million in an initial coin offering to build the “Finney” – it’s by far the biggest company of its kind to undertake the effort.  And the way the product has been internally positioned indicates that HTC sees a powerful role for decentralized technologies, particularly for putting the power to control consumers' digital identities firmly in their own hands.  And Raymond Pao, associate vice president of VR new technology for HTC, said that ""will be building the framework and phone that powers the decentralized web.""  ""We believe smartphones will be a critical component for the entire crypto ecosystem. This phone will act as the hub, just like the PC did in the early days of the Internet,"" he told CoinDesk, going on to say:  ""If we look at the industry, there are moving in two directions. One side is 100% centralized so that the platform company knows all the details of the users. The value the platform companies can provide is fully customized service to each single person. The more the user shares to the platform company, the better-customized services the platform companies can provide. On the opposite side, there are the users who care about their privacy more and want to own their information and identification. As the phone is the most personal device we use every day, we want to work on the decentralized eco-system with the users who care most about their privacy.""  Focus on usability  Efforts like this point to a deepening relationship between mobile devices and blockchains.  From the plethora of smartphone-based wallet apps to the ability to send cryptocurrency by way of SMS, it’s a combination that has driven both innovation and, for the unlucky, theft.  But challenges aside, HTC is pursuing what could be the next big thing for smartphone development.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Chen said that the goal was to build a product that would provide a high level of security for digital assets stored in the device, but one that also offers an ease of use other crypto-wallets on the market lack.  In particular, the Genesis is set to include a digital storefront for distributed apps, or dapps, in addition to a built-in wallet. The idea is that this store will be connected to offerings around existing blockchain networks, including ethereum. The phone will also have an API built into it so that developers can build additional apps based on the integrated networks.  Indeed, HTC appears to be betting that the ubiquitous nature of the smartphone – data from Statista indicates that nearly 3 billion people today use smartphones worldwide – is a natural fit for blockchain, especially as it relates to greater control over one’s information.  “We really care about this portable identity and users owning their identity and data, and we believe that the phone is the best place to do that,” Chen explained.  Not going it alone  As a major smartphone maker, one might think that HTC is looking to jump into the market with guns blazing.  But according to Chen, the Taiwanese manufacturer is taking a decidedly different approach, reaching out to projects like ethereum and DFinity as it looks to integrate those protocols into the Genesis phone.  “Right now, we're talking to ethereum, DFinity, and we want to run their clients to optimize for their nodes,” he explained. “We want to be the Switzerland for all protocols, ethereum etc, so the phone can do 20–30 percent of it in terms of verifying. “  “At some point, somebody needs to build a mobile-centric protocol,” he added.  The coming months, Chen went on to say, will see the slow release of additional information about the Genesis, including white papers, specifications and the like.  “We'll also be releasing some more white papers in the July–August time frame that have more of that, can have the phone be a node as opposed to mid-to-high-end servers,” he told CoinDesk.  And in a nod to the crypto community, a forthcoming pre-sale for the phone will only accept bitcoin and ethereum as payment.  “We're going to do a pre-sale, and we'll accept ethereum and bitcoin, for the pre-order,” Chen explained.

Jesse Powell, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, donated $1 million to the nonprofit Coin Center on Monday night at the advocacy organization’s annual gala in New York City. Kraken also pledged to match any donation to Coin Center until the end of the month, up to $1 million.  It was the biggest single donation made to Coin Center, said Neeraj Agrawal, a spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based think tank.  Kraken, based in San Francisco, is no stranger to the regulatory minefield Coin Center strives to defuse and build bridges across.  In April, Kraken was one of 13 exchanges that received an inquiry regarding ""internal controls and safeguards to protect consumer assets"" from former New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman.  Unlike many competitors  , Powell refused to respond, saying his exchange can “dodge this bullet” because it left New York in 2015, spurred by what he called the state’s onerous regulatory approach.  Kraken’s donation won Powell a round of applause. Sporting a baseball cap, the long-haired maverick entrepreneur did not make any remarks, letting the donation speaking for itself.  Satoshi walks into a bar...  Almost as warmly received was the litany of cryptocurrency-themed jokes delivered by Coin Center’s director of research, Peter Van Valkenburgh.  “Fork: really a word that usually isn’t in need of translation for the average person, you may be holding one right now,” Van Valkenburgh told the audience of finely-attired crypto veterans munching on their first course. He added:  “For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, this translates pretty directly to: free coins! And I’d add that, to their tax attorney, this translates to: 'fuck.'”  Jokes aside, the theme of the night was the importance of coming together as a community to curb stifling regulation through transparency and education.  Coin Center director Jerry Brito said a representative from the nonprofit has attended every congressional hearing related to cryptocurrency since 2013.  As several cryptocurrency industry experts said earlier in the day during a panel at Consensus 2018, the current regulatory environment for lawful exchanges could be aptly described as ""a mess.""

42380671,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuc7,1526391621,AWS Moves to Simplify Production-Grade Business Blockchains,"Cloud computing giant Amazon Web Services (AWS) is partnering with the ethereum design studio Consensys to make enterprise blockchains easier and faster to deploy.  Announced Tuesday at Consensus 2018, the two firms' business blockchain cloud service, Kaleido, aims to smooth the onboarding process for enterprise consortium members – a major challenge in the space – while simplifying the operation of private blockchain networks.  ""We have been following ethereum closely as it’s what many of our customers have been exploring, especially for enterprise use cases,"" Matt Yanchyshyn, the global technical lead for AWS' partner program, told CoinDesk.  However, he stressed that AWS is ""protocol-agnostic,"" noting that the company also supports Hyperledger's Sawtooth and R3's Corda platforms.  Indeed, AWS is no stranger to the space, having announced back in 2016 that it would start working with blockchain startups, offering dedicated technical support and infrastructure for the firms involved.  More recently, in April of this year AWS unveiled a new service for launching out-of-the-box blockchain networks for the ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric protocols.  Now, however, the unit of Amazon has aligned itself with one of the most influential organizations in the ethereum community. ""Working with ConsenSys will allow us to further understand customer needs and help accelerate their blockchain efforts,"" Yanchyshyn said.  Those who were around at Ethereum DevCon 1 back in 2015 might be reminded of ConsenSys' first stab at offering ethereum in the cloud, via Microsoft's Azure platform. But Kaleido aims to take the concept further.  Steve Cerveny, the founder of Kaleido, said early blockchain-as-a-service offerings were essentially a set of scripts to enable users to quickly stand up a sandbox environment for blockchains.  “This is great when you are starting out and you are experimenting, but it will only get you so far,"" he said. ""What we are seeing now is enterprises really have an appetite to try to get their projects all the way to production,” which Kaleido can handle.  Enterprise challenges  Stepping back, enterprises looking to participate in some kind of shared blockchain architecture face an array of physical networking and performance challenges around connecting their respective data centers.  In terms of managing participation in a blockchain consortium, one of the most commonly asked questions is how to onboard members. The process can take weeks, but a public cloud can reduce that time dramatically, according to Cerveny.  Then there’s the complexity that goes with advanced cryptography and consensus algorithms, not to mention governance, another big area of concern going forward.  Kaleido’s “shared IT” approach can deal with changes such as defining a new version of a smart contract, for example, said Cerveny.  “It’s about having the right tools and processes in place so that a consortium can set up policies that say 'there need to be so many votes or signatures collected before this contract gets deployed,'” he said.  The AWS-Consensys venture also brings a step closer the goal, increasingly shared by enterprise blockchain professionals, of connecting their private blockchains to the ethereum mainnet.  The platform offers a ""state relay"" between a private chain that a group of enterprises can set up and operate and a public blockchain.  “This allows you to configure a time interval and based upon the time interval, it aggregates together hashes and writes those up to the mainnet, so on the public blockchain,” said Cerveny.  In this way, the public blockchain serves as a ledger of last resort, as it were.  “So you get this permanent data point out on the mainnet that is irrefutable and acts as an objective arbitrator should a disagreement appear on the private chain,”Cerveny said.  Quorum in the cloud  Kaleido allows users to switch between several consensus algorithms and choose between two packages: Geth, which is the most popular client for the ethereum blockchain app platform; and Quorum, the enterprise version of ethereum developed by JPMorgan Chase.  Offering JPMorgan’s Quorum as an alternative package within Kaleido is timely, given that the Wall Street giant is widely known to be considering a spin-out of the project.  According to sources familiar with JPMorgan's thinking, IT management across a wide range of Quorum users was becoming burdensome to the bank. Kaleido seems to be designed to shoulder that task.  “In the enterprise ethereum space, Quorum is a very popular choice. It gives our users the ability to send private transactions between a certain subset of members on a private chain,” Cerveny said. “It was a no-brainer for us to include as an option on the platform.”  Correction: An earlier version of this story attributed quotes from Kaleido founder Steve Cerveny to the wrong executive.

42380681,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuoh,1526391022,Deloitte: 3 out of 4 Big Companies See 'Compelling' Case for Blockchain,"According to a Deloitte survey presented Tuesday at CoinDesk's Consensus event in New York City, 74 percent of large companies across seven countries see a ""compelling business case"" for blockchain technology.  Deloitte – the multinational ""Big Four"" firm that provides tax, auditing and consulting services – conducted the survey in late March and early April. The approximately 1,000 respondents represented companies with annual sales of at least $500 million in the U.S., China, Mexico, the U.K., France, Germany and Canada.  The firms represented a range of industries: financial services was the biggest group at 23 percent, followed by technology, media and telecommunications at 18 percent. Other industries included consumer products and healthcare.  In a statement, the head of Deloitte's U.S. financial services blockchain group, Linda Pawczuk, said the survey showed that ""momentum is shifting from a focus on 'blockchain tourism' and exploring the technology's potential to building practical business applications.""  Around half of the respondents who saw a ""compelling"" case for blockchain – 34 percent of the total – said their companies already have some form of blockchain system in production. An additional 41 percent said they aim to launch a blockchain application within the next year.  The enthusiasm for blockchain was not universally shared, however. Globally, 39 percent said blockchain is ""overhyped,"" with 44 percent of those saying so in the U.S. – up 10 percentage points from 2016.  American companies were generally less gung-ho about investing in blockchain than their counterparts in other countries – particularly China, where zero firms said they would not invest in blockchain within the coming year, compared to 16 percent in the U.S.  Another notable finding that emerged from the survey is the overlap between firms that see a compelling case for blockchain, and firms that think it's overhyped. At least a few respondents said both are true. The explanation likely has something to do with another result: 68 percent of firms globally are afraid of losing competitive advantage if they don't adopt blockchain technology.  As for what firms mean by ""blockchain"" – an occasionally contentious issue at Consensus so far – 52 percent of firms said they're focusing on permissioned models, 44 percent on private models internal to their own companies and 44 percent on public models such as ethereum (they were allowed to select more than one).

42376240,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUWwL5fh,1526390755,Bitcoin Price Eyes Breakout as Trading Range Tightens,"Bitcoin (BTC) is stuck in a narrow $550 range between the key long-term moving averages today, but may be prepping for a breakout, the technical charts suggest.  With the bull/bear bias now unclear, the big problem now is trying to work out in which direction the price will go.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $8,760 on Bitfinex, and is trading between the 50-day moving average (MA) at $8,287 and the 100-day moving average at $8,837.  The sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990 came to halt around the 50-day MA on Saturday. Further, the 50-day MA also acted as strong support on Monday. Meanwhile, on both occasions, the rebound from the 50-day MA ran out of steam around the 100-day MA hurdle.  The rangebound action seen in the last three days has established the 50-day MA as a major support and the 100-day MA as a formidable resistance and the breakout of this zone will likely set the tone for the next big move in BTC.  Daily chart  On Monday, BTC created a doji – a candlestick pattern, which indicates indecision in the marketplace. However, when viewed against the backdrop of the sell-off from the May 5 high of $9,990, the doji signals indecision among the bears (or bearish exhaustion). So, the immediate bearish outlook has been neutralized.  A close today (as per UTC) above the 100-day MA of $8,837 would signal bullish doji reversal and upside break of the trading range. Meanwhile, a close below the 50-day MA of $8,287 would confirm downside break of the trading range and bearish doji continuation pattern, i.e. sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 has resumed.  That said, the odds of the bullish breakout (or bull doji reversal) still appear low, as the bulls face an uphill task as seen in the chart below.  4-hour chart  On the above chart, the falling trendline resistance is seen around $8,810 and is immediately followed by hurdle at $8,910 (expanding channel resistance).  With major moving averages (50, 100 and 200) trending south (bearish), BTC bulls will likely struggle to cut through resistance at $8,900 in a convincing manner.  Note, the bears are about to score another brownie point by pushing the 50-candle MA below the 200-candle MA (bearish crossover).  The 5-day MA and the 10-day MA (seen in the daily chart) are also biased bearish.  View  Another rejection at the descending trendline seen in the 4-hour chart will likely yield a drop to 50-day MA located at $8,287.  That said, only a daily close (as per UTC) below the 50-day MA would signal a revival of the sell-off from the recent high of $9,990 and would allow a deeper drop to $7,787 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the April 1 low to the May 5 high) or even as low as $7,698 (61.8 percent Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the July 2015 low to the December 2017 high).  On the other hand, a convincing move above $8,910 (expanding channel hurdle) would expose resistance lined up at $9,390.

First announced last year, Coinbase Custody is a crypto storage service directed specifically at large financial institutions, as previously reported by CoinDesk. At the time, the exchange said users would have to pay a $100,000 set-up fee and keep a minimum of $10 million in deposits. Further, there is a minimum monthly fee based on the assets stored.  ""We have leveraged our experience safely storing more than $20 billion of cryptocurrency to create Coinbase Custody, the most secure crypto storage solution available,"" the firm said today.  The product is part of suite of institutional products being launched, according to a press release. Coinbase explained why it chose to launch the product in the current environment, saying:  ""The cryptocurrency market is maturing rapidly as more sophisticated institutional participants enter the space. In fact, in the past few months over 100 hedge funds were created that exclusively invest in and trade cryptocurrency. Some of the world’s largest financial institutions have also recently announced their plans to begin trading cryptocurrency.""  These institutions can bring ""new capital, greater awareness and additional infrastructure to the space,"" it said. ""This movement requires institutional grade products and services, something Coinbase has been developing with leading institutions and which we are proud to formally launch today.""  The company also announced that Coinbase Custody would be partnering with a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission-regulated broker-dealer. As a result, the product combines Coinbase's cryptocurrency security experience with third-party auditing and financial reporting validation, thus meeting the requirements of any other SEC-regulated broker dealer.

42380669,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX8yuar,1526364018,Whitfield Diffie Talks Cryptography 'Resurgence' and Blockchain,"""This is very fulfilling because when you thought the subject [of privacy and cryptography] must have run its course, it flares up again.""  Those words, from cryptography legend Whitfield Diffie, perhaps captured the essence of the first day of CoinDesk's Consensus 2018 conference. Diffie famously co-authored a landmark paper in 1976 that laid the foundations for public key cryptography, a key element of modern internet security and of cryptocurrencies.  During a freewheeling, jovial fireside chat with zcash founder Zooko Wilcox, Diffie praised blockchains and cryptocurrencies, saying the technology represents a ""resurgence"" of the work he helped start in the 1970s to empower individuals and strengthen privacy.  The current era, he said, reminds him of the time around 1997, when attendance at cryptographers' conferences suddenly jumped from the hundreds to the thousands.  Diffie remarked:  “These last few years have been another resurgence of cryptographic technology, and blockchain is now a huge refocus on the cryptographic aspects of these things.”  Wilcox echoed that sentiment and credited Satoshi Nakamoto for triggering this renaissance – causing Diffie to joke that they should ""get another chair"" on stage for bitcoin's unknown, pseudonymous creator. Still, Diffie – whose work has focused more on securing communications than financial transactions – similarly gave props to Nakamoto for accomplishing what many before in his field could not.  ""There were a good 10 years when privacy and cryptography were almost embarrassing to talk about in public,"" Wilcox said.  He cited the famous (or infamous) 1999 quote from Sun Microsystems co-founder Scott McNealy, who remarked: ""You have zero privacy anyway, get over it.""  ""In the ensuing 10 years, everyone sort of fell in line on that – until Satoshi,"" Wilcox said.  Diffie echoed that, saying: “For years many people [in cryptography] thought about how to develop money techniques, and nobody succeeded before that.""  That solicited a deadpan response from Wilcox – ""Yeah, I know"" – alluding to his own work in the 1990s at Digicash, a storied but unsuccessful digital currency venture.  'Bulletproof or useless'?  On a related subject, Diffie said he was not worried that the financial fortunes of the cryptocurrency market would compromise its cypherpunk ethos.  ""In some sense, you can't be a revolutionary force without eventually taking over the establishment,"" he said, drawing laughter from the audience. ""So I don't see a conflict between business development and political development.""  In fact, Diffie said that introducing market forces into protocols (as cryptocurrencies do) can be a powerful catalyst for the advancement of privacy-enhancing technology since battle-tested systems are likely to earn higher valuations than vulnerable ones.  ""I like that phrase 'introduce market forces,'"" Diffie said in response to a question from the moderator and CoinDesk research director Nolan Bauerle. ""The market force view of the development of cryptography may be the best single one we have, because so few things depend on this balance ... of offensive techniques and defensive techniques.""  Wilcox agreed in theory, though he cautioned that in the case of cryptocurrencies, market forces don't tend to distinguish between different coins at present.  Cryptocurrency prices tend to go up and down in unison, he said, ""regardless of whether the coin has proven to be bulletproof or useless."" In the long term, though, ""I assume they eventually will because I think the markets do that,"" Wilcox said.  Looking back on the breakthrough he helped bring about decades ago – which is widely hailed for breaking governments' monopoly on cryptography, thereby giving private companies and citizens access to encryption tools – Diffie said it had a similar decentralizing effect compared to today's blockchain projects.  ""If you don't have public-key [cryptography], it's not that you have to know the people you talk to, but you have to be connected to them by an administrative authority,"" he said, adding:  ""That works wonderfully for the U.S. military, it has lots of employees, a million or more and has a key management structure that follows. That just plain won't work for an internet of commerce.""

The new service, announced Tuesday, operates similarly to its existing bitcoin call options with a streamlined user face for investors, according to LedgerX president and chief risk officer Juthica Chou.  Chou explained:  ""We’re seeing more and more demand for people who want to earn some sort of interest off their bitcoin and lending is not exactly natural to people – especially lending where they earn their interest back in bitcoin. So we’re seeing participants come back to trading.""  Essentially, participants place a bet on what bitcoin's price will look like at some point in the future. If the price grows to that level within the time period, the participants recoup their investment. In the event that it doesn't, participants can sell their coins and receive fiat currency from the profit on that sale.  This is ""by far the largest trade that we've seen people coming in to do,"" Chou said. ""I would say that more than half our volume has been in this kind of trade.""  ""The contract that people are entering into here is such that they're selling an upside call option, so probably call it [two times] where bitcoin is now. If bitcoin tanks, they still collect the exact same premium and if bitcoin goes up then they end up selling bitcoin at about [two times],"" she explained.  Chou added that ""overall, I think the volatility is what impacts us ... the more [bitcoin's price] moves, the more fiat [investors] can collect.""  Only eligible contract participants, as defined by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, can trade in these call options, however. Users need to undergo ""the same [know-your-customer] and application process as standard LedgerX"" participants, said Chou.  She concluded:  ""I think given the price action people are going to be more and more interested ... we're very excited, because this is something we've seen a lot of on the LedgerX platform.""
