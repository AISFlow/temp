DOGE’s price bounces from a low of $0.07 on the daily timeframe as the price moves with eyes set on recapturing price above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to display a better price action than in recent times than Bitcoin (BTC) as the price reclaims the support of $0.08 and eyes a further rally to a region of $0.1 if the crypto market remains calm ahead of a monthly close. Despite the relief bounce from Dogecoin (DOGE), the price still trades below the key region of interest that would attract the attention of many buyers. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move leading to much fear about where the market could be headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Survey Suggests Institutional Investors Still Interested In Crypto Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart Despite the uncertainty and turbulence that has affected the price of Dogecoin (DOGE) and the crypto market as a large, many altcoins are struggling for survival, trying to stay afloat as the prices of altcoins continue in a downward price movement. DOGE’s price declined from a region of $0.15 to a region of $0.7 as DOGE lost this key support. The price of DOGE failed to hold above $0.1, leading to price retesting lower price points. The price of DOGE continues to hold above $0.08-$0.07, indicating a good sign for the DOGE army on the weekly chart and other timeframes. If the price of DOGE loses this region of interest, it would mean price going and bears controlling DOGE prices. Weekly resistance for the price of DOGE – $0.1. Weekly support for the price of DOGE – $0.08-$0.07. Price Analysis Of DOGE On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of DOGE remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $0.08 after DOGE saw its price decline from $0.15 to $0.07 as the market continues in its state of uncertainty. DOGE’s price continues to struggle as price aims for more relief bounce from this region. The price of DOGE needs to reclaim and trade above $0.1 for a short-term relief bounce. The $0.1, corresponding to the Fibonacci retracement value of 38.2%, will strongly resist the DOGE price. DOGE prices trade at $0.08 below 50 EMA, acting as resistance for DOGE to trend higher. The price of $0.012 on the daily timeframe for DOGE needs to be reclaimed for bulls to feel safe. Daily resistance for the DOGE price – $0.11. Daily support for the DOGE price – $0.08-$0.07.

42413580,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl9voI,1669307477,"Bitcoin, Ether Needn't Follow Financial Rules, Belgian Regulator Says","Cryptocurrencies without an issuer such as bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) are not securities, Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority said Thursday.  The regulator said it was getting an increasing number of questions about the regulatory treatment of crypto and hoped to address the most frequently occurring gray areas, including when digital assets can be classified as securities.  In jurisdictions such as the U.S., squabbles over when crypto is a security have led to court proceedings, with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying Ripple Labs should have registered its cryptocurrency XRP.  The Belgian rule “is neutral as regards technology,” FSMA added, suggesting that classification as a financial instrument or security shouldn’t depend on whether an asset uses a blockchain or something more traditional.  The rules, which largely mirror those set out in a July consultation, say that transferable instruments with an issuer are likely to constitute a security. That means they must produce an honest prospectus of information for potential investors, and must apply an European Union law known as MiFID, which requires financiers to be clear and to avoid conflicts of interest. But cryptocurrencies like bitcoin don't count as they don't have an issuer.  Even if those rules don’t apply, there are still existing requirements on crypto companies to apply anti-money laundering procedures, the guidance said. A new EU law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA) is also due to take effect in the coming years – and will require new crypto offerings to produce a white paper, comparable to a stock prospectus.

The cryptocurrency suffered amid the FTX’s collapse and the subsequent contagion, but market participants seem more optimistic about potential profits. Related Reading: Data Signals Major Red Flag As Chainlink (LINK) Rises 8% Over Last 7 Days As of this writing, Bitcoin has retraced back to yesterday’s highs. The BTC’s price is trading at $16,500 with sideways movement across the board. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap display similar price action. XRP remains the best-performing asset on the ranking. Bitcoin Sentiment Improves On The Derivatives Sector Data from the Options platform Deribit indicates that the shift in sentiment impacts this sector. The FTX collapse and the uncertainty around other crypto companies, such as Digital Currency Group (DCG) and crypto lender Genesis, kept the market on its toes. The latter company halted the withdrawal requests from its customers, and it’s looking to raise emergency capital to resume operations. According to the rumors that circulated last week, Genesis’s parent company DCG might be affected. The company denied the speculations and reaffirmed its long-term intentions to stay in the industry. As a result, the crypto market bounced as investors’ confidence improved. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve is hinting at a potential pivot. These two elements support the bullish momentum. Deribit noted that bulls took advantage of last week’s downside price action to accumulate Calls (buy orders) on the cheap. Optimistic investors are acquiring calls with strike prices above $17,000, $18,000, and $19,000 into December. In other words, the options market is betting on Bitcoin, trending higher by the end of the year. Deribit noted the following on Implied Volatility (IV), a metric affected by recent events. The metric is returning to normal levels hinting at the market finally absorbing any risk associated with FTX: However, options with close expiration dates (December 2th) might decay in value due to the low trading volume weekend. (…) the news flow reprieve has also allowed implied vol to retrace from a high-tension backwardation a few days ago, to a more normal contango term structure. A Christmas Miracle? In the last 24 hours, the options trading venue noted, bearish investors have been offloading some of their sell (put) contracts. These investors are betting on Bitcoin going lower than $10,000. There is still some bearish activity targeting the end of 2022. However, these investors might be hedging long spot positions and shielding themselves from potential unexpected events. The current state of the crypto market and the possibility of more contagion make this strategy favorable for long-term investors. Additional data provided by Deribit indicates that the sector has almost $5 billion in total Open Interest (OI). The majority of this metric seems positioned to the upside.

Both Argentine and Brazilian offices were affected, CEO Marcelo Cavazzoli said in an interview.  The job losses at Lemon trump those at other Latin crypto companies as they respond to the state of the industry. In May, Buenbit laid off 45% of its staff, some 80 employees, due to what the crypto exchange called the “global overhaul” in the tech industry. Bitso, another exchange, also laid off 80 employees in May.  “We do not know when the venture capital market will recover, and even less so for a company in a hyper growth stage between a Series A and a Series C,” Cavazzoli said.  In July 2021, Lemon raised $16.3 million in a Series A funding round led by British fund Kingsway Capital. The company has extended the round, adding $27.8 million and elevating the total to $44.1 million, Cavazzoli said Thursday.  “That extension gives us the backbone to get through the winter that we see coming at an investment level,” he said. “We're not dependent on more investment for the next few years. If the market recovers sooner, great, but it's not something we'll run after.”  Lemon had planned to deploy almost the entire amount on its expansion in Brazil. Given the current context, its move into the South American country will be “more strategic and niche,” Cavazzoli said. The exchange put plans to expand into Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay by the end of 2022 on the back burner.  On Nov. 3, following CoinDesk’s revelations on the financial links between FTX and Alameda, Lemon withdrew nearly all of the funds it invested in Alameda Research, leaving only a “tiny amount” that FTX Ventures had invested in Lemon in its Series A extension, Cavazzoli said, adding that the exchange does not expect to recoup that money.  Cavazzoli said Lemon released a proof of reserves and a proof of liabilities certified by an auditor and a scribe last week, while on Wednesday it added a live booking test on its app. Coming soon, the executive added, Lemon will introduce a crypto-based proof of liabilities.  In addition, Lemon plans to use only fully decentralized protocols for its earn product, allowing users to choose their preferred protocol for investing their assets, Cavazzoli said.

42388596,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRIwrD,1669305979,Ethereum Developers Agree on What Could Be Included in the Next Upgrade – but Not When,"Ethereum developers decided Thursday to consider eight Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) for inclusion in the network’s upcoming hard fork, called “Shanghai.” The hard fork upgrade will unlock Beacon Chain staked ETH withdrawals, and might include proposals that address issues of scalability and others designed to improve the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  But there is no consensus yet on when that will happen.  Having EIPs “considered for inclusion” (CFI) means that the developers will commit to developing these proposals and will run them through tests on developer networks (devnets). However, there’s no guarantee that all these proposals will make the final cut for inclusion in Shanghai.  Even before the core developers met, they’d determined that Beacon Chain withdrawals, or EIP 4895, was definitely going to be part of the fork. This means that once Ethereum goes through its next upgrade, users that staked ether prior to the Merge by locking them up in the Beacon Chain smart contract will be able to access them, along with any additional accrued rewards.  While developers agreed which EIPs they will focus their efforts on leading up to Shanghai, they didn’t settle on a time frame for the hard fork’s mainnet deployment. The Ethereum Foundation gave a soft timeline for unlocking staked ETH at six to 12 months after the Merge, but earlier last week, the language around that started to change.  By the end of this call, the timeline for Shanghai wasn’t any clearer. Some developers want to expedite Shanghai and include only the ETH withdrawal EIP along with a few other smaller EIPs, sometime in March 2023. Then, a subsequent fork would include another significant scaling upgrade – proto-danksharding – and would ship sometime during the fall of 2023.  Other developers want a bigger, comprehensive Shanghai upgrade to happen that would include both major upgrades at that second, later time.  For now, EIP 4844, also known as proto-danksharding, is in the CFI package. EIP 4844 is a significant first step the protocol would take toward making the network more scalable through sharding, a method that splits up the network into “shards” as a way to increase its capacity and bring down gas fees.  Read more: Anxious Ethereum Stakers Question When They’ll Be Able to Access Funds  Other EIPs  The implementation of the EVM Object Format (EOF) made it into the batch, which is a collection of EIPs that essentially upgrade the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the environment where Ethereum is able to deploy smart contracts. Most of the changes are focused on making the smart contract execution safer, by verifying that certain conditions are met. The EIPs that will upgrade the Ethereum Virtual Machine are EIP 3540, EIP 3670, EIP 4200, EIP 4570, EIP 5450.  The last proposal that is being considered for inclusion is EIP 2537, which would see the addition of ""BLS precompile."" With this proposal, Ethereum could create more secure cryptographic proofs,and allow for better interoperability with the Beacon Chain.  Last month, developers introduced the Shandong testnet, where they can explore and resolve any bugs related to some of these EIPs.

Bitcoin aSOPR Plummets To Lows Not Observed Since Almost 4 Years Ago As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, the current capitulation is deeper than during both the 2015 bear and the COVID crash. The “Spent Output Profit Ratio” (or the SOPR in short) is an indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors are selling at a loss or at a profit right now. When the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means the overall market is realizing some amount of profit currently. On the other hand, the indicator having values below the threshold implies the average holder is selling at a loss at the moment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Closing In On This Bullish Crossover, Relief Finally Ahead? Naturally, the SOPR being exactly equal to 1 suggests the investors as a whole are just breaking even right now. A modified version of this metric is the “Adjusted SOPR” (aSOPR), which doesn’t take into account any selling of coins that was done within 1 hour of the purchase of said coins. By doing so, the indicator filters any noise from the data that wouldn’t have had any significant consequences on the market. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR since the year 2014: The value of the metric seems to have seen a heavy drawdown in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As you can see in the above graph, the Bitcoin aSOPR has observed a rapid downwards trajectory below the 1-level recently. This means that BTC investors have been selling their coins at huge losses. The indicator’s value is now the lowest it has been since the December of 2018, when the bear market of the previous cycle saw its bottom. Related Reading: Crypto Market Back To High Correlation As All Indexes Closely Follow Bitcoin These current levels of the metric are also lower than they were during both the 2015 bear market bottom as well as the COVID black swan crash. Plummets in the aSOPR like the one now indicate that there is widespread capitulation going in the Bitcoin market. Such deep loss realizations have historically lead to the formation of lows in the price as they result in a shift in coins from weak hands to strong hands. Since the indicator is currently at historical lows, it’s possible the market is approaching a bottom for this cycle. However, it’s worth noting that the 2018 bottom saw even deeper values than now, so it’s uncertain whether the current cycle will also see similar lows or not, before the true bottom is in.

The rules were proposed as amendments to the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency bill, which includes reforms that can help authorities combat local crime.  The same lawmakers in the House of Commons, the Parliament's lower house, had already voted in favor of amendments that would give powers to local enforcement to seize, freeze and recover crypto tied to crime. At the second reading of the bill on Oct. 13, they called to mirror these measures in the country’s existing counter-terrorism legislation as well.  “This addresses a gap in current counterterrorism legislation,” Tom Tugendhat, the minister of state responsible for crime and terrorism regulation, said during Tuesday’s line-by-line reading of the bill. Existing counter-terrorism legislation only covers forfeiture of cash, assets and money in bank accounts, a government factsheet said.  Tugendhat added that the counterterrorism legislation will “importantly mitigate the risk posed by those that cannot be prosecuted under the criminal system, but use their proceeds stored as crypto assets to perpetrate further criminality.”  Some other proposed amendments that could have required the country’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) as well as British overseas territories to publish reports on their capacity to regulate crypto were withdrawn from consideration during Thursday’s reading of the bill.  The crime bill will continue to be scrutinized in Parliament before it is passed into law.

ETH’s price declined from a region of $1,450 to a region of $1,300 as ETH lost this key support. The price of ETH failed to hold above $1,300, leading to price retesting lower price points. The price of ETH continues to hold above $1,000, indicating a good sign for bulls on the weekly chart and other timeframes.

ETH’s price continues to struggle as price aims for more relief bounce from this region. The price of ETH needs to reclaim and trade above $1,300 for a short-term relief bounce. The $1,250, corresponds to the Fibonacci retracement value of 38.8%, acting as a strong resistance to the ETH price.

42394095,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXWUT,1669297500,Crypto Self-Custodying Offers Protection Amid FTX Exchange Fallout,"The last few weeks have been among the craziest that the crypto markets have ever seen. The once-trusted exchange FTX (and all the FTX associated companies), led by founder Sam Bankman-Fried, has filed bankruptcy after the exchange was discovered to be insolvent.  Many crypto exchanges have failed in the past, losing client funds and causing many people to lose the money they had on the exchange. Crypto exchanges failing, unfortunately, is not an uncommon event in crypto, but the scale of fraud and mismanagement with FTX is unprecedented. These recent events have caused many in traditional finance to lose faith in the future of crypto, put tremendous downward pressure on crypto prices and lead many to call for further regulation in the crypto markets.  For the crypto investor, it is important to note these failures and astronomical losses are due to fraud, mismanagement of client funds and incompetence – not the failure of the software or blockchains themselves. As the fallout from these corporate failures continues, it is important for advisors to understand best practices for themselves and their clients who continue to invest in cryptocurrencies.  You're reading Crypto for Advisors, a weekly look at digital assets and the future of finance for financial advisors. Subscribe here to receive the mailing every Thursday.  Not your keys, not your coins  There’s a popular saying in crypto, “Not your keys, not your coins.” Cryptocurrency is a bearer asset. Meaning, the person or entity who controls the private keys to a crypto wallet essentially owns the coins held in that wallet.  By contrast, when a client decides to custody assets with an exchange or third party, they are trusting that party to properly secure the private keys to their holdings. Many exchanges have, unfortunately, mismanaged client assets, either by not protecting the private keys and creating an opportunity for a malicious actor to steal the funds or by blatantly misusing client deposits for their own purposes.  The safest way for anyone to hold cryptocurrency is in a wallet that they control. This can be done with a hardware wallet, such as a ledger, a paper wallet or in their own software wallet. This is called “self-custody” of assets. As long as the user does not share the private keys with anyone, no one can steal or misuse the assets without accessing the private keys. It is important to note that the cryptographic foundation that cryptocurrencies use is nearly impossible to hack, creating tremendous security for assets held in a private wallet.  For many investors, this creates an additional level of complexity when investing in cryptocurrency. There’s a certain level of technological knowledge required to use the self-custody method of storing crypto. However, in the spirit of complete security, it is worth learning how to do this.  Advisors should consider educating their clients on this method. If done correctly, it will prevent client funds from being stolen or misused by a third party.  Read more: Multisignature Wallets Can Keep Your Coins Safer (If You Use Them Right)  Regulated custodians and exchanges  Not all crypto exchanges are held to the same standard. Many exchanges do hold themselves to the highest standard of protecting client deposits. Certain exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini are governed by strict regulations and are not allowed to mix client assets without user permission.  Some exchanges publish audited financials and prove that they hold client assets 1:1. They often publish reports showing “proof of reserves,” which essentially prove their solvency. This means the exchange holds all client deposits in a secure wallet and that user deposits can be withdrawn at client discretion. The exchange or custodian does not mix client assets with corporate assets or use client deposits for their own trading or market making.  While this is one measure of security better than a lot of offshore exchanges, the exchange is still holding private keys to control and own the crypto. When users elect to hold deposits with a third party, they are essentially trusting the third party to properly secure the private keys to their coins.  While using a regulated custodian and exchange is easier and more convenient than self-custody of assets, it is not as secure. Many exchanges have an impeccable track record of protecting client assets, and thus far have proven to be trustworthy. It is important to know that anytime custody is outsourced, the investor is trusting that the third party will properly hold and use client assets.  Read more: What Are 'Fully Backed' Reserves?  CeFi is not DeFi  Many “crypto banks” including Celsius Network and Voyager Digital have filed for bankruptcy in 2022. These crypto banks offered a yield-like service where users could hold crypto with the company and generate yield on assets. These companies would lend out user deposits to borrowers (many of whom were hedge funds and institutional investors), passing on the interest charged to depositors, in a bank-like fashion.  These centralized finance (CeFi) companies were not regulated like banks, and unfortunately their lending standards and practices were not adequate. Sparked by the crypto sell-off that started in the summer of 2022, many of these CeFi businesses were over leveraged and eventually lost customer funds. CeFi companies are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and their failures will likely result in a total loss of customer funds.  While we’ve seen these CeFi companies fail, it is important to note that many of the large decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols are still fully operational and are continuing to work as designed. Interacting with a DeFi protocol is more involved than using a CeFi platform. DeFi still offers investors the ability to generate yield on their crypto positions without trusting a third party to properly manage asset security. It is important to note that many DeFi protocols are still considered risky investments and must be properly understood and analyzed before use.  Read more: CeFi Broke. But DeFi Is Not Without Blame  While the last few weeks have been difficult for many in the crypto space, it is important to note that these frauds and catastrophes are due to human and corporate failures, not a failure of the technology that powers cryptocurrencies. Blockchains including Bitcoin and Ethereum are still fully operational and secure, and they offer opportunities for those that believe in the future disruption the technology offers.  It is important for all investors to understand the risk they take when they outsource custody and it is worth learning how to self-custody assets and interact directly with DeFi protocols in order to protect their crypto investments.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Jackson Wood,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/24/self-custody-of-crypto-offers-protection-amid-ftx-exchange-fallout,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e53be5fe7a86423e2b7b6c3093f1fcc9a16437ec-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Built on Ethereum, Liquity Protocol has been battle-tested since its debut in early 2021, and continues to chug along, having withstood multiple periods of market volatility since its launch. Taking a look at how Liquity Protocol's foundational ethos of enabling interest-free loans uniquely positions it to cater to a far-reaching market that extends well beyond the existing DeFi userbase. “Money is the one thing competition would not make cheap, because its attractiveness rests on it preserving its ‘dearness.’” - F.A. Hayek, ""Denationalisation of Money,"" Third Edition, 1990, p. 94 As 2022 winds down, the crypto market as a whole faces a sobering reality check. A number of DeFi projects that were touted as decentralized and robust during the 2021 bull market have, in fact, proven to be the complete opposite as the bear market has taken its toll. Among other reasons, many DeFi protocols have been crippled by faulty economic designs, unthorough smart contract development, and the shortcomings of DAOs . All of this has been especially true in the competitive stablecoin space, where the collapse of projects like Terra , once valued in the tens of billions of dollars, has reinforced the need for more resilient stablecoin projects that are truly committed to first principles. In this blog post, I will focus on Liquity Protocol ( LQTY-USD ), and explain why I personally believe its foundational ethos of enabling interest-free loans uniquely positions it to cater to a far-reaching market that extends well beyond the existing DeFi userbase. Rise and Shine When it comes to stablecoin design innovations, Liquity Protocol is a gem in a sea of imitations . Built on Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), it has been battle-tested since its debut in early 2021, and continues to chug along, having withstood multiple periods of market volatility since its launch. Being immutable and governance-free, there is no human interference possible with the protocol, and it was designed this way by the Liquity team from its inception. In the flight to safety that many DeFi users have embarked upon during 2022’s crypto bear market, by shifting away from both pseudo-decentralized stablecoins and questionable centralized stablecoins, LUSD-USD has understandably upheld a resilience premium above its $1 peg as a result. The outsized demand for LUSD versus other stablecoins it trades against reflects the growing confidence users have in Liquity Protocol as reliable DeFi infrastructure , as well as LUSD’s value proposition as a censorship-resistant and transparent stablecoin entirely backed by ETH on-chain. “Liquity’s smart contracts will be code for ever engrained in the consensus-approved global status of the Ethereum machine... Liquity, in other words, has created (good) infrastructure...” - Luca Prosperi, Liquity + a Glimpse of (My) Future, Dirt Roads Blog, 10/13/22 Amidst the uncertainty plaguing the crypto market at large, LUSD is experiencing a noteworthy resurgence of growth, as the number of troves representing active and distinct LUSD borrowers marches forward to perhaps soon reclaim its prior highs: Dune Analytics This “rise and shine” of Liquity Protocol’s usage is a well-deserved accomplishment for its founding team, who continue to innovate and have had incredible success with their recent launch of Chicken Bonds , a novel approach to advancing Protocol-Owned Liquidity across DeFi - beginning with LUSD. Broad Appeal of Zero-Interest Loans When users borrow LUSD against their ETH, it’s interest-free . Although there is a one-time borrowing fee upon drawing LUSD from a trove that’s typically around 0.5%, there are no ongoing interest charges being paid by LUSD borrowers to Liquity Protocol itself. This begs the question: is there an opportunity for LUSD to be more widely adopted in parts of the world where interest on loans is generally frowned upon for cultural and/or religious reasons, such as is the case in predominantly Muslim regions across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), as well as parts of Asia, for example? Let’s delve deeper. The field of Islamic finance largely operates on Profit and Loss Sharing (PLS) arrangements, since interest on loans is generally forbidden based on prevailing interpretations of the Shariah, which refers to the overarching values of the Muslim tradition. As is to be expected, opinions on this subject do vary, and contemporary Islamic thinkers, such as the late Dr. Muhammad Shahrur , have considered it more holistically from the standpoint of the burden on the borrower and other factors referenced in The Quran. For the purposes of this blog post though, I’ll consider this topic from the normative position. “Hence, fiscal transactions in a given society move, by responding to the economic and social needs, between the two extremes of a) payments of taxes and charity money to b) giving loans with interest, while a middle position is reached if c) interest-free loans are provided.” - Dr. Muhammad Shahrur, ""The Qur'an, Morality and Critical Reason,"" pg. 209 For example, let us consider the case of someone looking to take out a loan to purchase a home. When taking out an Islamic mortgage , under a PLS arrangement the borrower would not pay interest on the loan, and the bank would instead buy the property upfront on their behalf. The bank may then mark up the value of the home to a defined level and the borrower would then pay the bank back in installments, such that their ownership share rises over time until the home is fully theirs. Connecting the Dots Although I am not in any sense an expert on Islamic finance, one can generally recognize from reading various writings on the topic that there is no prohibition on capital providers to earn a profit, as long as they are assuming risks in their attempts to do so. On the question of risks, smart contract risk is an immanent feature of DeFi. Even with Liquity Protocol, despite its demonstrated resilience thus far, this reality nevertheless exists in the backdrop, and users should be mindful of it. Also, Liquity Protocol and its borrowers collectively assume a risk from under collateralized troves, because if the Total Collateral Ratio in the system falls below 150%, Recovery Mode kicks in. Islamic financing is generally also asset-backed, and the assets are recognized as having intrinsic value. In the case of Liquity Protocol, LUSD can only be borrowed against ETH as collateral, which is the base asset and utility token of the Ethereum network. An opinion paper published in 2019 by Amanie Global Islamic Finance Advisors offers commentary on ETH and Ethereum from the standpoint of their compliance with the Shariah, following exploratory research on the subject spearheaded by Virgil Griffith of The Ethereum Foundation at the time. “The right to make and carry out contracts is fundamental to liberty and is protected by the Shariah... With the advent of blockchain technology nowadays, the potential of [the] Ethereum network to develop smart contract[s] and applications is endless...It is important to analyse each smart contract or application on a case to case basis because different permutations may exist and the prospect of real-case applications using smart contract[s] is enormous.” - Amanie Advisors and The Ethereum Foundation, Shariah White Paper on Ether, April 2019, pg. 30 - 31 With LUSD, users are utilizing their ETH to borrow the stablecoin for their own usage; thus, there is no counterparty as a capital provider involved in the transaction. Liquity Protocol itself issues the LUSD to borrowers in accordance with its unalterable smart contract’s terms. Institutions may also help facilitate this process for their clients; this is already being done by asset managers like Wave Financial , for example, whereby they have helped their users borrow LUSD against their ETH to purchase homes. While a borrowing fee is applied by Liquity Protocol, this fee appears to be no different than, for example, the upfront fees vis-a-vis closing costs that are applied in the case of a borrower taking out a Shariah-compliant mortgage. And because Liquity Protocol offers an in-built use case for LUSD via its Stability Pool , LUSD’s inherent utility in this regard enables it to be used by borrowers to uphold the protocol’s ability to cover liquidations of under-collateralized troves in the event that ETH’s price drops. In a sense, all of this may be viewed as a mutually beneficial system akin to the PLS dynamic underlying Islamic finance, since redistribution of collateral and debt from liquidated troves to open and remaining troves may be triggered if there is not enough LUSD in the Stability Pool to cover liquidations. Furthermore, for troves that are liquidated, while the respective borrowers will lose the ETH that they put up as collateral, their LUSD debt is nevertheless forgiven by Liquity Protocol, so there is no additional burden of payment expected of them thereafter. The onus is thus on the borrower to ensure their trove is sufficiently collateralized per their individual risk tolerance and Liquity’s terms, and the protocol’s documentation emphasizes this in advance. Conclusion While the value proposition of crypto may increasingly be in question as the bear market persists and 2023 approaches, there still remains an ongoing curiosity among global audiences for this technology and its long-term potential. In the Muslim world, crypto-related startups have seen an uptick, and the debate around what is and isn’t permissible in the context of cultural and religious norms will likely persist as this nascent asset class evolves over time and the adoption of regulations offers more clarity. In the midst of this debate, I personally view Liquity Protocol to be worthwhile for Islamic financial institutions across MENA, Asia, and beyond to consider more closely as a decentralized and interest-free stablecoin application, particularly as they explore how they may be able to participate in DeFi on Ethereum and enable users to more actively engage and innovate in the space. Platforms like DeFi Llama have recently created Halal dashboards consisting of DeFi yield opportunities which they have assessed to be compliant with the Shariah. This reflects the growing need for specialists in Islamic finance to apply their understanding of the subject to DeFi, such that Muslim users can better navigate the space in accordance to their individual beliefs. Followers of other religious traditions who may share similar beliefs could also find such guidance as helpful. Considering their commendable and established track record, I look forward to seeing what the team behind Liquity Protocol has to offer toward advancing the development of stablecoins and other ideas in the years to come , and I hope that their products will ultimately cater to a wider audience of new users worldwide who are seeking to participate in the future of DeFi on Ethereum.

Remarkably, the trading volume of LINK has dropped 20% in the last 24 hours to just $389 million. Chainlink was trading at $6.66 at press time, showing a restrained bounce from the bottom of a channel that LINK has been in since early May. The lower bound of the channel is at $5.35, while key resistance for the LINK price is currently at $9.52. At the current price, LINK is hovering just below the 50-, 100-, and 200-day simple moving averages (SMAs). With an RSI of 49.5 in the 1-day chart, LINK is in neutral territory. However, the bounce of the last three days should be taken with a grain of salt. On-chain data from Santiment shows that there has been a significant increase in exchange inflows following the recent price surge. Nearly 15 million LINK were transferred to known crypto exchange wallets in the last 24 hours. In the 1-week chart LINK / BTC, the token is in a crucial moment: will LINK be able to break through the critical trendline resistance or will it be the fourth rejection in the last 13 months. As one analyst noted, this could be a “make it or break it” type moment for Chainlink. Fundamental Remains Strong For Chainlink (LINK) As Chainlink faces a pivotal moment, the fundamentals seem stronger than ever. In about two weeks, Chainlink will launch its staking feature. Starting December 06 at 12pm ET, LINK owners and node operators will be able to earn rewards to increase the security of decentralized oracle services.

Despite the relief for the price of Bitcoin (BTC), the price still trades below its previous all-time high support of $18,000, which is a bit problematic considering this region now serves as resistance for a major rally. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move leading to much fear about where the market could be headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Recovery Just Getting Started or It’s Bull Trap? Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The price of BTC suffered a decline in price to a region of $15,500, with many expecting the price to dump further to a region of $14,000 to $12,000 when the price bounced off from this region after forming a bullish pin bar as buyers pushed the price higher to a region of $16,500. BTC’s price needs to break above $18,500 for more signs of relief as this region has become key for better price action to a high of $19,500. Weekly resistance for the price of BTC – $18,500. Weekly support for the price of BTC – $15,500. Price Analysis Of BTC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BTC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $16,500 after a decline to a region of $15,500 due to the FTX fiasco. If the price of BTC breaks above $17,500, we could see more rallies for BTC price; a break below a region of $16,000 would be a bear trap as the price could go lower. The price of BTC trades below 50 and 200 EMA acting as resistance for the price of BTC to trend higher. The price of $18,500 and $23,500 corresponds to the price of 50 and 200 EMA that needs to be reclaimed for bulls to be safe from further downtrend by bears. Daily resistance for the BTC price – $17,500. Daily support for the BTC price – $16,500-$15,500.

There’s hope for Polkadot, and here’s a quick article at how the crypto has been faring: The DOT’s price went up because of some major changes on the chain. However, according to the indicators, the negative outlook remains intact. Based on a recent tweet, the integrations have not only enabled liquid staking for GLMR and MOVR tokens, but they have also caused a dramatic increase in developer engagement within the ecosystem.

Optimism Lingers For DOT While there is little doubt that ecosystem trends are encouraging, multiple signs suggest that investors may be getting carried away. We may deduce that the current price action is not a solid rally for DOT from the fact that MFI numbers are falling. 1/3 An exciting integration in the Dotsama ecosystem! 🎉@bifrost_finance provides something unique for @MoonbeamNetwork and @MoonriverNW parachains! 🚀 The Liquid Staking for $GLMR and $MOVR Tokens. 🪙 Watch the video to learn more: ⬇️https://t.co/PNDCVBWJ1f pic.twitter.com/Hr3Zk6tyX1 — Polkadot Ecosystem PromoTeam (@PromoTeamPD) November 22, 2022 The token was previously rejected at $5.43, which was the price level breached by bears in the preceding days.

Polkadot Price Forecast Surprisingly optimistic ecosystem trends do not necessarily convert into real-world benefits. This is the case for DOT since technical indicators do not confirm the recent story of sunshine and rainbows. Investors and traders should exercise caution with DOT.

Bybit will offer up to $10 million to existing and new market makers on its platform, as well as dedicated account managers, it said in an emailed statement.  Bybit, the 35th largest exchange by trading volume according to CoinMarketCap, joins Binance, the largest, in trying to turn the industry tumult of the past few weeks into an opportunity. The crypto market has lost two-thirds of its value in a year and has been roiled by the collapse of large market participants.  Earlier this month crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy, triggering a domino effect across the already-troubled industry, prompting other firms to warn of worsening liquidity crunches. Binance's CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said in an interview with Bloomberg Thursday that the company is targeting $1 billion for a recovery fund to buy distressed crypto assets.  “We are all in this together, and it’s up to everyone to do what they can to support our industry and this is one way we are helping to give back,” Bybit CEO and co-founder Ben Zhou said in the statement.

That's the message from the derivatives market, which shows no signs of a letup in demand for puts, or bearish bets, tied to bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) in the wake of the dovish Fed minutes released Wednesday.  The persistent put bias indicates the market is squarely focused on contagion sparked by the downfall of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX, formerly one the world's largest crypto trading platforms by volume, and is unlikely to find a bottom solely on the back of improving macro conditions.  ""Crypto is still very much event risk driven, reacting to news/rumors about the health of major crypto lender Genesis,"" Dick Lo, the founder and CEO of quant-driven trading firm TDX Strategies, said.  The crypto market, roiled by the Fed's aggressive liquidity tightening, has long been waiting for the central bank to signal a shift away from rapid-fire interest rate hikes. The market got what it wanted Wednesday.  ""A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of [interest rate] increase would likely soon be appropriate,"" the minutes said.  The minutes also hinted at a lack of support for Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting “higher rates for longer"" statement, sending the U.S. dollar and Treasury yields lower and stocks higher.  Yet, bitcoin and ether put-call skews, which measure the cost of bullish calls relative to bearish puts, remain entrenched in negative territory, implying a bias for puts.  Both short-term and long-term skews have barely bounced in favor of calls since the release of the Fed minutes.  ""Clients are not selling their holdings, but want to hedge the downside,"" Lo said.  South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant said, ""The ongoing financial problems of Genesis Trading, which needs [$0.5 billion to $1.0 billion] from outside investors to stay in business, keep pushing the price of bitcoin down.""  Genesis, one of the many firms exposed to FTX, has hired a restructuring adviser after halting withdrawals. FTX filed for bankruptcy protection on Nov. 11. Genesis is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk.  Bitcoin traded near $16,580 at press time, having failed to establish a foothold above the $17,000 mark early Thursday.  According to some chart analysts, the largest cryptocurrency by market value is headed toward $13,000.  ""Recent volatility in the cryptocurrency market has generated a long-term breakdown in bitcoin below key support near $18.3K, increasing downside risk to support from the 2019 high (~$13.9K) over the coming months,"" Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies, said in a note to clients.

4718977,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509934,1669285433,Dump Incoming? Rogue BTC-e Sends $165 Million In Bitcoin To Personal Wallets And Exchanges,"After a year of near dormancy, Bitcoin funds of the rogue exchange BTC-e are on the move again. Chainalysis, an American blockchain analysis firm headquartered in New York City, is reporting that 10,000 BTC, worth about $165 million, have been transferred. The destination of the transactions are personal wallets, exchange deposit addresses and other services. Remarkably, the transfer is the largest withdrawal since April 2018. BTC-e was a crypto exchange that was founded in July 2011 and shut down in 2017 as a result of a joint investigation by the U.S. Secret Service and the FBI. According to the allegations, BTC-e was instrumental in laundering money for ransomware attacks. As NewsBTC reported, security researchers estimated that BTC-e was responsible for 95% of all ransomware payments and their conversion into fiat currencies. Related Reading: Top 3 Altcoins Performers For The Week – LTC, CRV, ZEC Russian citizen and co-founder of BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik, was also allegedly involved in the theft of 530,000 of the more than 800,000 Bitcoin stolen from Mt. Gox. After serving two years in prison in France, Vinnik was extradited to the U.S. in August. As Chainalysis notes, BTC-e still held a significant amount of Bitcoin at the time of its shutdown in 2017. In April 2018, BTC-e moved more than 30,000 Bitcoin from its service wallet. About $50 million of that went to the now-sanctioned OTC counter Suex. BTC-e Fraudster About To Dump Their Bitcoin? Since then, the fraudulent exchange’s masterminds had been relatively quiet. Only in October 2021, BTC-e sent over 100 Bitcoin worth more than $6 million to personal wallets and eventually to several exchanges “that service Russia and other Eastern European countries,” according to Chainalysis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction: Recovery Just Getting Started or It’s Bull Trap? Yesterday’s transaction appears to be the tip of the iceberg and a longer-planned move. The fraudsters of BTC-e began withdrawing cryptocurrencies as early as a month ago. On Oct. 26, both BTC-e and its successor exchange WEX sent small amounts of Bitcoin to Webmoney, a Russian electronic payment service. Then, on November 11, BTC-e conducted a test by indirectly transferring 100 Bitcoin to an exchange. After seemingly being successful, BTC-e pulled of yesterdays big move. Chainalysis concluded that approximately 9,950 Bitcoin are remaining in personal wallets of the fraudsters, “while the rest was moved through a series of intermediaries to four deposit addresses at two large exchanges. In the case of Exchange 1, depicted above, our analysis suggests a Russian exchange may have served as an intermediary to launder this BTC-e money”. CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju confirmed that the BTC originate from the criminals linked to the 2014 Mt. Gox hack. “They sent 65 BTC to Hitbtc a few hours ago, so it’s not a gov auction or anything,” he said. Ju urged the exchange to suspend the account due to suspicious activity. 7-year-old 10,000 $BTC moved today. No surprise, it's from criminals, like most of the old Bitcoins.

Sam Bankman-Fried's collapsed crypto enterprise, under new leadership, has kicked off insolvency proceedings in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Shortly after the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on Nov. 11, court-appointed liquidators in the Bahamas filed another chapter 15 suit for cross-border insolvency proceedings in a New York court.  FTX, in a consequent court filing, asked the court to allow the chapter 15 filing to be transferred to Delaware so that all proceedings could take place in one venue. In the same filing, FTX accused the Bahamian government of directing unauthorized access to FTX's systems in order to withdraw assets after the firm had filed for bankruptcy.  The Securities Commission announced afterwards that it had ordered the contents of FTX's crypto wallets to be transferred to government-controlled wallets for safekeeping.  On Tuesday, during the first court hearing for the chapter 11 proceedings, FTX's lawyers said they had reached an agreement with the Bahamian liquidators to transfer their New York case to Delaware. While announcing the agreement, James Bromley, a partner in Sullivan & Cromwell’s Finance and Restructuring Group, said FTX had evidence showing that ""there have been movement of assets out of the debtors' estates to the Bahamas.""  The Commission's statement comes after the hearing, and said it was ""concerning"" that FTX ""chose to rely on the statements of individuals they have (in other filings) characterized as unreliable sources of information and potentially 'seriously compromised.'”  Statements made by other FTX officials about the exchange suffering ""significant thefts"" and reports that their systems were compromised ""reinforces the wisdom of the Commission’s prompt action to secure these digital assets.""

4716527,https://newsbtc.com/?p=509928,1669280034,"Top 3 Altcoins Performers For The Week – LTC, CRV, ZEC","The crypto market keeps getting touchy and challenging for most crypto traders and investors, with the market being hit virtually every week with bad news that sends the price of most altcoins to their weekly lows. Recently, the price action displayed by many altcoins has been problematic as many altcoins battle for survival. The Domino effect of the FTX saga and other huge investors involved has left the market at a standstill as the market is yet to make a major move after previous weeks. Here are the top 3 altcoins that have performed better during the week. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Solana Price Prediction: Why Upsides Could Be Limited in SOL Litecoin (LTC) Price Analysis On The Daily Chart Most crypto traders and investors have had a rough few days, with many concerned about where the market is headed after so much turbulence in the crypto space. Many altcoins have struggled to show strength, losing key support in a bid to survive. The current market uncertainty has caused traders and investors to be hesitant to purchase altcoins, as there is no guarantee that they will rise in value any time soon. LTC has shown itself as a stand-up performer over the past few weeks and days. The price of LTC on the daily chart has shown bullish strength despite the market uncertainty that has affected major crypto projects that have continued to build in this bear market, and more FUD (fear of uncertainty and doubt) persists. LTC saw its price traded in a region of $60 on the daily chart. Still, the price bounced off this region as LTC’s price rallied to a high of $80 before facing a minor resistance to trend higher. If the price of LTC holds above $75, we could see more rally to a region of $90. Top 3 Altcoins – Price Analysis Of Curve DAO (CRV) On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of CRV remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $0.65 support after the price bounced off from its daily low of $0.4. CRV’s price trades at $0.7 below its 50 and 200 EMA, acting as resistance for the price of CRV. The price of $0.77 and $1.2 corresponds to the prices at these levels, acting as resistance. If the price of CRV breaks and holds above $0.8, we could see more rallies for the CRV price to a region of $1.2, where the price could face resistance to trend higher. Price Analysis Of Zcash (ZEC) On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of ZEC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $40 support after the price bounced off from its daily low of $30. ZEC’s price trades at $42 below its 50 and 200 EMA, acting as resistance for the price of ZEC. The price of $49 and $70 corresponds to the prices at these levels, acting as resistance. The price of ZEC needs to break this region for more signs of relief.

The fallout of FTX's bankruptcy has been felt deeply across the entire industry, leading to other companies like lender BlockFi reportedly preparing for bankruptcy.

SOL price is now recovering, but upsides might be limited above $15 and $17. Sol price traded as low as $10.92 before it recovered a few points against the US Dollar. The price is now trading below $15 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $12.45 on the 4-hours chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could face a strong selling interest near $15 and $17 in the coming days. Solana Price Starts Short-Term Recovery This month, solana price saw a strong downward move below the $30 level. There was a strong move below the $25 and $20 support levels. Sol price even dumped below the $15 level. Finally, it found support near $11 and traded as low as $10.92.

Besides, there was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance near $12.45 on the 4-hours chart of the SOL/USD pair. However, the pair is still trading below $15 and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours). On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $15 level and the 100 simple moving average (4-hours).

Source: SOLUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $17 zone might send the price towards the $20 level in the near term. Any more gains might send the price towards the $25 level. Fresh Decline in SOL? If SOL fails to clear the $15 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. An initial support on the downside is near the $13.00 level. The first major support is near the $12 level. The next major support is near the $11 level or the recent low. If there is a downside break below the $11 support, the bears might even push the price below $10.

The revelation comes days after decentralized crypto exchange (DEX) Uniswap made a similar update to its privacy policy, as reported.  ConsenSys said it collects some data related to user identification, such as contact details, profile information along with some other user data.  The firm added that when using Infura, which is the default remote procedure call (RPC) provider, on digital wallet MetaMask, Infura will collect the user's IP address and Ethereum wallet address for transactions. RPC is a protocol for requesting data and information from a program running on a third-party computer server.  If a user switches to a different RPC on MetaMask the financial data will not be collected. Blockchain tool developer Infura and the digital wallet MetaMask are both products that are offered by ConsenSys.

ETH is now approaching a major hurdle near $1,230 and $1,250. Ethereum started an upside correction above the $1,120 and $1,150 resistance levels. The price is now trading above $1,150 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could rise further towards $1,230, but the bears might take a strong stand. Ethereum Price Faces Hurdle Ethereum price formed a base above the $1,070 level and started a recovery wave, similar to bitcoin. ETH slowly moved higher and was able to clear the $1,150 resistance zone. The bulls pushed the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1,231 swing high to $1,073 low. Ether price is now trading above $1,150 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support near $1,190 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the $1,230 level and the $1,250 zone. To start a real recovery wave and gain bullish momentum, the price must settle above $1,250.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: A day before the U.S. Thanksgiving weekend, bitcoin was trading up more than 2%.  Insights: The CEO ofcrypto lending and borrowing platform Hexn.io, believes recent crypto debacles will leave the industry stronger.  Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 837.24 +21.0 ▲ 2.6% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,568 +394.6 ▲ 2.4% Ethereum (ETH) $1,183 +49.5 ▲ 4.4% S&P 500 daily close  4,027.26 +23.7 ▲ 0.6% Gold  $1,752 +15.0 ▲ 0.9% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.71% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price. Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  FOMC Minutes Buoy Crypto Investors  By James Rubin  Bitcoin started celebrating the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend a little early, rising 2.4% as investors savored the latest encouraging signs that the U.S. Federal Reserve would soon be ratcheting back its monetary hawkishness.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,560. With a couple of minor glitches, BTC has remained steadfast over $16,000 even as the fallout from crypto exchange FTX's collapse has widened.  Ether was recently changing hands at $1,183, up 4.4% from Tuesday, same time. Most other major cryptos were recently in the green with LINK and UNI rising more than 5% and 3%, respectively. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, jumped more than 2%.  Crypto prices dovetailed with equity markets, which closed higher Wednesday after minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) revealed that bank officials might be receptive to slowing interest rate increases from their recent diet of 75 basis point hikes. The tech-focused Nasdaq climbed about 1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each rose a few fractions of a percentage point.  Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at strategy and research group Fairlead Strategies, told CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program that bitcoin's price increases came amid ""signs"" of ""short-term downside exhaustion.""  ""Those are measurable for us, not just a feeling,"" Stockton said. ""These are from some indicators we use on the technical front, and on the daily and weekly charts of bitcoin, we have counter trend signals that suggest we'll see stabilization, not a big relief rally, but stabilization for another few weeks.""  Insights  A CEO Sees Pluses in Cryptos Recent Ruins  By Shaurya Malwa and James Rubin  The collapse of crypto exchange FTX and widening fallout have raised fundamental questions about the future of the crypto industry.  Can users trust any projects to protect their assets? How low will prices sink?  Yet, Sergei Ivano, CEO at crypto lending and borrowing platform Hexn.io, believes the crisis will leave the industry stronger by weeding out weaker companies, encouraging others to be more transparent and fostering stronger regulatory efforts.  “Recent events connected to FTX and Alameda Research (FTX’s research and trading arm) are positive for the whole industry because they have triggered deleverage,” Ivano said. “All weak and unprofitable businesses that have grown during (the) bullish phase of 2020-2021 will face problems if they don’t understand risk-management and principles of dealing in a bearish market.”  Ivano noted that markets are weak and that institutions are facing significant outflows. “On-chain metrics reveals that large and old addresses in Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to grow,” he said.  “Customers don't trust centralized entities, choosing [decentralized finance] protocols instead and withdrawing their funds from centralized markets,” he added, but said this situation will change in the next several months,” when the current stressful period ends.  He believes that the slapdash business practices and accounting procedures that enabled not only FTX’s implosion (and Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection filing but other debacles over the past six months, including the crumbling of the Terra ecosystem and Chapter 15 bankruptcy filing by crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, will spur “more strict regulation.”  “Regulators will require more information about the structure of balances of centralized exchanges and platforms,” Ivano said.  Yet, he also paused over some companies current efforts to share information about their reserves. “Leaders of industry are trying to publish proof of reserves of their companies, but these proofs are funny because this information is useless without knowledge about obligations of companies,” he said. “Proper way to implement such report is to publish reserves and obligations in the same time.”  Important events  5:00 p.m. HKT/SGT(9:00 UTC) Germany's IFO - Business Climate (Nov)  5:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(21:45 UTC) New Zealand Retail Sales (QoQ)  CoinDesk TV  In case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of ""First Mover"" on CoinDesk TV:  Sam Bankman-Fried's Mea Culpa; Kraken Incoming CEO on Crypto's Future  FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried ""froze up in the face of pressure"" as his company collapsed, he wrote in a new letter sent to employees of the company he once helmed.

4701835,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4560272-comparing-performance-chinese-us-crypto-ecommerce-internet-companies?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,1669248925,"Comparing Performance Of Chinese And U.S. Crypto, eCommerce, And Internet Companies","Summary Brokers have started recommending purchases of Chinese stocks. Comparing the performance of U.S. and Chinese stocks tells an important story. Other factors affecting Chinese stocks can alter your decision. In light of the recent recommendations to reenter the Chinese stock market, I thought it would be useful to compare the performance and risk of the comparable U.S. stocks. On November 20, Bloomberg reported that “China will reopen from its Covid Zero lockdowns gradually and its property sector will recover slowly with policy support, helping propel the country’s benchmark stock index by 13% in the next 12 months, according to Hao Hong, chief economist at GROW Investment Group.” There are three areas of interest, eCommerce, Internet and Search, and cryptocurrencies. Let’s take a brief look at each. (Please note that Chinese stocks listed on U.S. Exchanges are ADRs and therefore carry higher risk and do not provide voting rights to shareholders.) eCommerce In the U.S. we have Amazon (AMZN). In China they have Baidu ( BIDU ), JD.com ( JD ), and Alibaba ( BABA ) (BABAF), all big, viable companies. Even conservative traders and retirement funds are likely to hold these stocks. As for performance over the past 5 years, all have suffered a global economic downtrun. Figure 1 shows the price history adjusted to 100 on January 1, 2017. JD tracks AMZN the closest, while BIDU and BABA have declined the most. Only AMZN seems to be holding above the S&P performance for the 5-year period. Source: CSI and Yahoo data Figure 1. eCommerce stocks price history. In terms of volatility, Chinese stocks are 2 to 3 times more volatile than AMZN (Figure 2). It is important to size Chinese stock positions much smaller (1/2 to 1/3) than U.S. stocks in order to get the best diversification. Source: CSI data Figure 2. Volatility of eCommerce stocks. Internet The two most actively traded internet stocks are Google (GOOG) ( GOOGL ) and Tencent ( TCEHY ). As you can see in Figure 3, Google has had a smoother path and a better return than Tencent. When we compare the volatility (Figure 4), Google shows 24% and Tencent 37%. Overall, Chinese stocks are more volatile than their U.S. equivalents. Source: CSI and Yahoo data Figure 3. Internet stocks price history. Source: CSI and Yahoo data Figure 4. Internet stocks volatility. Crypto For cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is the biggest player in the world. Ethereum (ETH-USD) is said to offer more commercial applications, but it tracks similarly to Bitcoin, as seen in Figure 5. Prices have been set to 100 as of January 1, 2018. Source: CSI data Figure 5. Crypto price history. The major Asian crypto markets are Tamadoge (Japan) and Tether (USDT-USD) (the biggest after Bitcoin in Asia), but they have a remarkably short price history, so they have been omitted. We can compare Binance (BNB-USD) with Coinbase ( COIN ), two popular crypto “exchanges.” In Figure 6 we see that BNB has held up better than COIN but has considerable volatility. Source: CSI and Yahoo data Figure 6. Crypto exchanges Binance and Coin. Volatility One of the biggest issues with crypto is its volatility. In Figure 7 we compare the volatility of BTC and ETH against the S&P ETF (SPY). Over the past 5 years, SPY has had an average 20-day volatility of 14.6% while BTC and ETH have been 55% and 74% respectively. The volatility of the exchanges (Figure 8) shows Binance has been 77% versus COIN at 22%. Even with COIN heading towards zero, its volatility is very low. Source: CSI data Figure 7. Crypto volatility. Source: CSI and Yahoo data Figure 8. Crypto Exchange volatility. The volatility tells us that we need to trade 1/5 of our normal size in BTC or ETH and even less in BNB. It is important that all positions have equal volatility. But the frequent, large spike present a different problem, which we will discuss next. That Was the Good News For most of the comparisons, U.S. stocks outperformed Chinese, and with lower volatility. Often must lower. We also can see that Chinese stocks have more volatility spikes than U.S. stocks. That brings us to the underlying issues trading Chinese stocks: Much like OPEC, the Chinese government makes surprise announcements about their economy and policy changes. We have no advance notice. The Chinese policy on COVID-19 has been severe and filled with surprises. They will lockdown a city of 1 million if one person tests positive. On November 3, 2022 they locked down Zhengshou , home of the largest iPhone factory. The U.S. has restricted imports of Chinese semiconductors. It has restricted exports of some technology. This has had a negative effect on Chinese stocks. Due to government policy, one-half the foreign companies in Hong Kong are looking to relocate . Even more important, the Chinese have never agreed to allow the New York Stock Exchange to audit its company’s books. We have no idea if any of the data is correct. When combined with unexpected policy announcements, which drives up volatility, not being able to have confidence in earnings or capitalization seems to be even a bigger problem. We can measure volatility but have no clue if any of the other numbers are true. How to Handle Broker Recommendations Some brokers are recommending buying Chinese stocks now that the government has changed the rule on housing and China is easing COVID-19 restrictions. That may turn out to be a good recommendation, but the risks are high. If you participate, it should be with a very small position and an eye on another change in Chinese policy.
