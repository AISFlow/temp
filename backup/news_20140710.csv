42425867,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgl5h,1405030206,Argentinian Money Regulator Mandates Reporting on Bitcoin Activity,"Argentina's Unidad de Información Financiera (UIF) has ordered financial services companies within the country to report all transactions involving digital currency.  The UIF document, which outlines amendments to previous regulations, cites the threat of money laundering and criminal financing. It suggests that the UIF will act as a conduit for information enabling greater oversight of bitcoin and other ""virtual coins"". The UIF is Argentina's chief anti-money laundering agency.  The announcement, dated 4th July, comes more than a month after Argentina's central bank issued a warning to businesses seeking to use digital currencies. In that release, the BCRA cautioned that ""there is no consensus on the nature of these assets"". Other financial regulators in Latin America have adopted similar stances.  A translation of the UIF resolution reads:  ""Virtual currencies are often traded remotely online. The movement of assets, and that entities from different countries can participate in the same jurisdictions that do not have controls to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism, make it difficult for regulated entities to detect suspicious transactions.""  Financial institutions in Argentina are required to file monthly digital currency reports with the UIF. The purpose, the agency said, is to prevent criminal funds from moving outside of the country's regulatory framework.  Digital currency vs electric money  As outlined in the document, the UIF draws a distinction between digital currency and electric money. The latter, the document reads, is meant to represent fiat currencies in an online format whereas bitcoin and other digital currencies fall outside of that definition.  Whereas electric monies are considered well-regulated, Argentina's money regulators suggest that digital currencies risk promoting financial fraud or criminal funding. The amendments serve to push companies in the Argentine financial system to track and catalog transactions made using digital currencies.  ""The regulated entities...must pay particular attention to the risk involving transactions with virtual currencies and establish enhanced monitoring on these operations.""  The rules take effect in August, according to the document.  Sign of regulatory tightening  At least one member of Argentina's bitcoin communiy sees the UIF action as bad sign for bitcoin.  Carlos Guberman, a researcher at the Universidad Argentina de la Empresa who specializes in digital currencies, told CoinDesk that the move reflects the continued restrictive nature of national money regulators in regards to digital currency.  He said:  ""I think the decision of Argentinean authorities regarding virtual currency reports as suspicious of money laundering are a bad thing. It is somehow weird that at the very same time that there is in place a law for exteriorizing dollar holding of Argentinians, the UIF comes out with a measure like this that is clearly penalizing virtual currencies.""  Guberman added that he believes many bitcoin transactions currently take place in dark pools and off-the-grid markets. As a result, he doesn't foresee these regulations having an impact on those activities in the near future.  Tough environment for bitcoin  The UIF oversight order is yet another development from a Latin American financial or monetary regulator that cites the threat of money laundering, criminal activity and terrorist financing in relation to digital currency.  In June, Bolivia's central bank, El Banco Central de Bolivia, announced that it was instituting a ban on bitcoin. At the time, it cited risks to investors and consumers when it deemed the use of the digital currency illegal.  Colombia's central bank said in April that bitcoin is not a legal currency, adding that it was conducting research into the kinds of dangers cited by the UIF and other government agencies around the globe. However, Colombia has stopped short of declaring bitcoin illegal.  Despite these regulatory challenges, bitcoin businesses in Latin America continue to grow and develop.  Earlier this month, Uruguay-headquartered bitcoin startup Moneero opened its debut wallet service to beta testers after operating under the radar. As well, the region's first Ripple gateway opened in June, bringing the payment network to seven local markets including Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico.

42425887,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglZh,1405022735,CoinSummit Day One: Capital Ventures and Wall Street's Stance,"CoinSummit kicked off at the East Wintergarden in London's financial district, Canary Wharf, today. The bitcoin confab is pitched as the place for serious players in the emerging cryptocurrency economy to talk shop.  The space, a large, split-level glass vault, provided a suitably transparent backdrop to an event largely dedicated to conversation about transparency and other pertinent issues.  The first half of the two-day event featured 10 panels and keynotes, plus a slot for startups to pitch the assembled investors, media and fellow entrepreneurs.  Roger Ver  The man dubbed 'bitcoin Jesus' kicked off the conference with his keynote speech 'The Future Is Ours' – an appropriately grand title. Ver began by asking the crowd who among them were ""bitcurious"", or who wanted to learn more about bitcoin.  His talk skimmed through the highlights of bitcoin's explosive growth from the time he became involved in it three and a half years ago, imploring them at the end to tell friends and family about bitcoin's benefits.  Part evangelical sermon and part travelogue, Ver spoke of his regular presence at conferences worldwide to spread the good word about bitcoin. Most recently he was en route to London from Hong Kong, via New Jersey. 20 hours of traveling demanded a restful night. What better way is there to book a room than through Expedia.com, and paying with bitcoin? He said:  ""Not only is bitcoin a fair money system, it's also a hell of a lot easier to pull out your smartphone and hit 'send' when you're jetlagged rather than pulling out your credit card and typing all those numbers.""  VC involvement  Venture capital involvement in bitcoin was high up on the schedule, following Ver and Garrick Hilleman's presentation of the highlights of CoinDesk's State of Bitcoin Q2 report.  On the panel were Barend van den Brande of Hummingbird Ventures; Jan Hammer, who led Index Ventures' investment in BitPay; Founders Fund's Geoff Lewis and Steve Waterhouse of bitcoin hedge fund Pantera Capital.  Lewis was probably the most outspoken member on the panel. Having been bullish on bitcoin's development this year, he likened the activity in the startup scene to the rise of Web 2.0 and its massive social networks:  ""It's like how merchants were trying to figure out social in 2006, 2007. It's on everyone's mind. When I talk to people at large companies, they're trying to figure out the strategy. They're not doing much yet, but they're trying to figure it out. This will be a watershed year, and it has to be a watershed year to keep things moving forward, for widespread merchant acceptance.""  Van der Brande highlighted the difference in attitudes toward bitcoin investment in Europe. ""We're outside our comfort zone now,"" he said. ""There are lots of moving parts [with bitcoin ventures]. It's fashionable but most of the VC community in Europe is more in 'listening' mode rather than going out and taking big bets.""  Hammer underlined the different rates of growth between merchant and consumer adoption. He said firms in the bitcoin space should focus on the latter because efforts to sign merchants up have created an imbalance.  ""We're seeing a lot of catch-up on merchant services; a lot of developer and infrastructure type of companies,"" he said. ""We need more great consumer applications. The merchant side has advanced ahead of consumer adoption.""  Swarm CEO Joel Dietz asked the panel what value venture capitalists added to portfolio companies, considering the existence crowd-funding options now available. Swarm itself raised crowdfunding for its 'crypto-equity' concept. Lewis responded:  ""VCs tend to overstate their value-add. Entrepreneurs should assume that the VC's primary value is writing the cheque.""  Crypto-Wall Street  The big question on market-watchers' minds is when the financial bigwigs of Wall Street will participate in the cryptocurrency economy.  So far, funds like Pantera Capital have been the exception rather than the norm. Discussing the topic were Chad Cascarilla of Liberty City Ventures – who was recently appointed chief executive of bitcoin exchange itBit – and the Bay Hill Capital trader Alec Petro. Michael Terpin of marketing firm Social Radius moderated.  Terpin began by addressing the question of bitcoin and Wall Street, asking the panel to rate the US financial center's attitude on a scale from one to 10.  Cascarilla gave it a 3.5, arguing that in spite of Wall Street's nascent interest in digital currency technology, the practical difficulties involving the integration of bitcoin, banking and other financial services complicate their involvement.  ""Custody of bitcoins yourself is a significant pain point. You can't just fire and forget. If you could, we would be talking about Wall Street at 7 or 8 or even 9,"" he said.  Terpin asked if institutions like sovereign wealth funds and family offices would become involved in bitcoin investing. Petro, whose firm is a market maker for bitcoin options, said he had speculated that a sovereign wealth fund would have emerged as the winner of the US Marshals Silk Road auction:  ""I was betting it was a sovereign wealth fund. I know of some funds that are looking. For a sovereign wealth fund, [that amount of bitcoin] is a drop in the bucket.""  Financial services  The panel on integrating bitcoin with the financial services industry featured Matthias Kroner of Fidor Bank; Tim Parsa, chief executive of BitReserve; and Avish Bhama of Vaurum, for whom Tim Draper famously purchased the Silk Road bitcoins to help provide liquidity.  For Kroner, bitcoin is just part of the overall picture of financial education. In his view, people aren't talking about their money enough. After several World Cup jokes, he said:  ""Whoever is talking about bitcoin is extremely educated [about financial matters]. They are not afraid of volatility, unlike the ones who are not in bitcoin. If I don't eat meat, why should I bother about any sort of cow disease?""  On whether bitcoin would become a national currency in the United States, Parsa was sceptical.  ""I'm an American,"" he said. ""We couldn't even get the metric system to be adopted in the United States. So no, it's never going to be adopted as currency.""  Parsa also attacked the ideologically-driven boosters of bitcoin, saying that they were being ""religious"" about the cryptocurrency. He likened bitcoin boosters to the promoters of esperanto, a language that was designed to be used globally, but which never really gained popularity:  ""When people get religious about things, it's hard to respond without hurting anyone's feelings or getting people upset [...] Money is like the air we breathe, it's the language we speak. I don't speak esperanto, but it was a language that people wanted to introduce that was incredibly easy and fast for everybody, but the problem was, people already had a language.""  Price predictions  Here's a quick selection of where today's speakers and panelists see the price of bitcoin going:  Steve Waterhouse: ""Strong indications that the price is going up.""  Jan Hammer: ""Not in the business of predicting foreign exchange prices.""  Geoff Lewis: $2,000 sometime in 2014.  Chad Cascarillo: $1,850 by end of 2014; $18,500 by 2017.  Alec Petro: $1,200 by end of 2014, $3,000 by 2017.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SPONSORED | TRADING,Joon Ian Wong,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/10/coinsummit-day-one-capital-ventures-and-wall-streets-stance,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd17e18e9112f86dcedec3313d7dff4b7275b820-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425870,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgl9h,1405009891,Bitcoin Opportunity Corp Invests $250k in Swedish Exchange Safello,"Swedish bitcoin exchange Safello has received $250,000 in new funding from the Bitcoin Opportunity Corp (BOC).  Safello  made the announcement at the CoinSummit conference in London today. Notably, the financing is the BOC's largest investment outside of the US yet.  The new funds are anticipated to allow the Stockholm-based company to increase its marketing efforts across Europe and roll out new products and features faster. As a result, the BOC's chief executive and founder, Barry Silbert, expects to see Safello’s customer and transaction volume growth accelerate, he said in an interview with CoinDesk.  The Bitcoin Opportunity Corp backs almost 30 companies, including industry leaders such as BitPay, Coinbase, Ripple Labs, Circle, Xapo and BitPesa.  “As bitcoin awareness continues to increase throughout Europe,” Silbert said, “a growing number of consumers, merchants and investors are looking for ways to buy, hold and use bitcoin. Safello’s business model aligns perfectly with this trend.”  Prime position  The exchange launched last August and has since established its credibility in the European bitcoin market. To date, it has made direct payments available to users through 86 banks across 11 countries.  Safello’s chief executive and co-founder, Frank Schuil, told CoinDesk that the company plans to continue following its existing roadmap, tipping his hat to its favorable geographic and strategic position within its network of “topnotch investors, advisors and partners”.  He said:  “From day one, Safello set out to be more than just an exchange. We like to see our existing product as Safello Phase I whereas the funding and revenues are put to use to develop Safello Phase II.”  Specifically, the company wants to expand its existing exchange with more payment methods into more regions, while continuing to focus on building products and features people love, he said.  In February, Safello secured $600,000 in a seed round led by bitcoin evangelist Erik Voorhees that also included angel investor Roger Ver and Blockchain CEO Nicolas Cary among others.  The European landscape  For all of Safello’s advantages, Schuil doesn’t dismiss the point that the development of bitcoin and digital currency startups in Europe is restricted by a lack of funding:  “US companies rake in decent sums of money akin to the market potential of cryptocurrencies, whereas European startups hardly get to see the light of day. That puts them at a disadvantage in the global game we play.”  Still, the regulatory divide between European countries allows bitcoin companies like Safello to flourish, he said.  In the past month alone, regulators from Italy, Estonia, Switzerland, Russia and Poland have taken measures intended to change their attitudes and approaches toward digital currencies. Whether positive or negative, discourse at the governmental level still goes some way towards furthering bitcoin education and awareness.  Schuil raised the topic of the European Banking Authority, which last week warned financial institutions to keep clear of digital currencies until the industry is regulated.  “In reality,” he said, “they are putting innovation budgets in place to build their own crypto banks. That's an exciting development and hard to imagine even six months ago.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET,Tanaya Macheel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/10/bitcoin-opportunity-corp-invests-250k-in-swedish-exchange-safello,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a51fb28c466d756cbbd9baf289774699480d429e-1260x678.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425869,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIgl7h,1405006056,"Netagio Launches Exchange for Gold, Sterling and Bitcoin Traders","Bitcoin storage firm Netagio has today launched an exchange that allows users to trade bitcoin, pounds sterling and gold.  The exchange offers users three order-books, allowing trades between bitcoin and gold, bitcoin and sterling, and gold and sterling.  ""[Investors] want to take advantage of the opportunities available from being able to trade between the asset classes on a single continuous exchange, any time of day or night,"" said Netagio's chief executive Simon Hamblin, speaking on the sidelines of the CoinSummit conference in London's financial district, Canary Wharf.  Quicker transfers  Netagio, which is based on the Isle of Man, a British crown dependancy, is able to take deposits and send withdrawals through British banks. This makes transactions quicker and cheaper for users because of the absence of international wire transfer fees, Hamblin said.  He added:  ""If you send us funds, they will appear in your account pretty much the same day. If you send out [a withdrawal], it will be credited within one working day as well.""  Netagio began life as a bitcoin storage firm. Its cold-storage services, which were launched about a year ago, allow users to store their coins offline, across multiple locations. Hamblin said the firm has ""thousands"" of customers, and he expects this number to continue growing exponentially, though he wouldn't provide specifics.  However, Netagio's cold-storage business was just a precursor to Hamblin's plan to start a British exchange. This plan was initially impeded by Netagio's inability to find a British bank willing to take it on.  ""From talking to a lot of banks over the last year, it's not worth going to the large high-street banks. The smaller banks, like Fidor Bank for example, are much more innovative in their approach. They are much more willing to listen to what you're trying to do,"" Hamblin said.  British banking facilities  Netagio is now able to use British banking facilities for its exchange, thanks to its relationship with payment processor Capital International Group, which is also based on the Isle of Man.  Customers who deposit funds with Netagio actually send the funds to a bank account controlled by the payment processor. Capital uses a network of banks, so Netagio users will be depositing funds into different banks at different times.  Hamblin said:  ""Payment processors are more willing to [work with bitcoin businesses]; they see the gap in the market. They're leveraging their strong banking relationships to make this happen for everyone.""  The British banks' reticence to deal with bitcoin businesses – with many exchanges struggling to open bank accounts that can accept customer deposits – is seriously restricting the sector's growth in the UK, Hamblin said. CoinDesk has reported on the difficulties exchanges have encountered when obtaining accounts with British banks in the past.  ""From a banking perspective, it's still as difficult as it was [a year ago], which is why we haven't seen an explosion in bitcoin businesses in the UK. You just can't get a banking relationship,"" he said.  Lobbying UK authorities  Netagio is also bolstered by its location on the Isle of Man. The island is seeking to fashion itself into a choice jurisdiction for bitcoin businesses via favourable policies and a new startup incubator.  Hamblin said his firm is a member of the UK Digital Currency Association, and that it would continue to support lobbying efforts by the association to obtain guidance from British banks and the Financial Conduct Authority on what they expect to see from a bitcoin business before dealing with one.  ""We are trying to get guidance from banks, from the FCA [...] so that [bitcoin busineses] are not being approached [with regulatory issues] from all angles.""  Netagio was spun out of GoldMoney Group, which provides gold storage services and was established in 1991. Its bitcoin cold storage business competes with similar services offered in the UK, including Elliptic.  The company's new offering puts it in competition with Coinfloor, a London-based exchange that recently made a high-profile hire by appointing a former managing director at Credit Suisse and head of metals at Goldman Sachs as its executive chairman.

42425877,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglNh,1404997841,Government-Backed Bitcoin Industry Association to Launch in Japan,"Japan has formed a new advocacy group for bitcoin businesses and, notably, it has the explicit backing of the nation's government.  The Japan Authority of Digital Asset (JADA) will be a bitcoin business-only group intended to establish standards and codes of conduct for its members.  Brainchild of Japanese member of parliament Mineyuki Fukuda (from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party) and his IT Committee, the organisation was formed after consultation with members of bitcoin's business community.  The latter included digital currency exchange Kraken, which the IT Committee invited to play a key role in setting up JADA after a number of meetings.  Japan's government has stated officially it does not intend to legislate for regulation of bitcoin, instead preferring to allow the nascent technology to flourish and determine its own way by regulating itself. To that end, JADA will propose guidelines and ""softly monitor"" its members, with no legislation required.  In effect, the government seems to want to demonstrate that progress is being made, despite its hands-off approach to regulation, after bitcoin's recent notoriety surrounding the collapse of Mt. Gox.  JADA is still in its formative stages, brainstorming policy and gathering members from the bitcoin community. It will launch formally next month.  Best practice  This 'self-policing' method of getting bitcoin businesses to behave might serve as a model for other countries who are struggling to determine how digital currency activity could fit into existing or new legal frameworks. It allows the new technology to flourish in an open legal environment, while still maintaining checks and standards.  What makes JADA unique (perhaps globally, at present), is the fact it operates with the full endorsement and support of the national government, while remaining an independent body.  Advocate in government  Fukuda has been a key proponent of bitcoin development in Japan, regularly meeting with members of the community and showing a personal interest in the underlying technology.  JADA and the government's IT Committee have consulted with Japan's Financial Services Authority (FSA) and consequently JADA is to be the official liaison between the business community and government departments overseeing finance, tax, consumer affairs and the police.  JADA is currently talking to bitcoin businesses in Japan, including ATM companies and exchanges, and working on membership policies. Consumer awareness, not just of bitcoin itself but also of responsibilities and risks surrounding it, is also a priority.  Media image  Ayako Miyaguchi  , Japan VP of Operations for Payward Inc. (Kraken's parent company) said she is impressed at the improvement in bitcoin's image in her home country, particularly in the media:  ""The media still might not fully understand how much of a big deal this is – it's still learning, but definitely getting better.""  A documentary broadcast last week by Japanese national broadcaster NHK was ""not bad"", Miyaguchi said. The crew had spent roughly two weeks in San Francisco interviewing bitcoin businesses, including Kraken, about the challenges they face, including interaction with banks and governments.  This follows an earlier, more negative NHK documentary broadcast in February that dedicated 15 minutes to an introduction to bitcoin, followed by 15 minutes on Silk Road, the online drugs marketplace.  Miyaguchi said that while bitcoin's media image in Japan may have started out negative, thanks to Silk Road and Mt. Gox, it also led to 90% of Japanese becoming aware of bitcoin.  ""In Japan, the negative often turns out positive"", she said, referring to years of stories disparaging the non-Japanese attributes of Facebook and iPhones before they eventually became market leaders in the country.  Additionally, banks once thought putting ATMs in convenience stores was a risky proposition, she added, and now they practically beg to place their machines there.  Establishing trust  While JADA couldn't monitor 100% of bitcoin businesses' actions, Miyaguchi said the same was true of regular businesses regulated by government legislation.  JADA would offer resources, advice and information on best practices, in order to prevent something like Mt. Gox occuring again.  ""There's a lot we can do to avoid that kind of situation,"" Miyaguchi said.  Bitcoin would never become popular in Japan without the endorsement of those in power, she added. In Japan, trust and relationships are considered the most important aspect of business, so progress is usually slow. Once that trust is established, though, acceptance can be swift.  Some in the country have said that Japan doesn't need bitcoin, that its existing e-cash methods work well and people still prefer paper cash over credit cards, which are usually paid off in full each month.  ""Japan doesn't always need a practical reason for something to become wildly popular,"" said Miyaguchi. ""People lined up for six hours outside Krispy Kreme when they opened here... Were they any better than the donuts people could get at other places? Not really.""",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Jon Southurst,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/10/government-backed-bitcoin-industry-association-to-launch-in-japan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eda828c3c153cddfd53e164acfa3d0472b35262-1260x837.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425872,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglDh,1404992783,First Regulated Bitcoin Investment Fund to Launch on Island of Jersey,"The island of Jersey has approved the launch of a bitcoin investment fund, which the government claims will be the first such fund to be regulated.  Called the Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), the fund received regulatory approval from the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) earlier this week. The fund, set up by Global Advisors Jersey Limited (GAJL), is set to launch on the 1st August.  The Island of Jersey is the largest of the Channel Islands and is a self-governing British Crown dependency. Due to its liberal tax policies the island developed into a tax haven during the 20th century.  As a consequence, the island’s economy is based largely on financial services, although in recent years it has started attracting e-commerce companies and now has a bitcoin advocacy group that is campaigning to turn it into a 'bitcoin isle'.  Business-friendly jurisdiction  The island’s assistant chief minister in charge of financial services, Senator Philip Ozouf, welcomed GABI's regulatory approval and imminent launch, saying Jersey is pleased to be paving the way toward regulated bitcoin funds.  “Fintech, which broadly defines the emerging digital industry in finance, is a sector that I believe holds significant opportunities for Jersey,” said Ozouf.  He emphasized that the government will “offer its full support” for innovative measures undertaken by the industry and the island’s regulator, adding:  “We are working closely with the Commission, industry and Digital Jersey to help develop the Island as a natural hub for fintech business. We are committed to maximising the benefits and opportunities of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin in a well-regulated environment.”  Positive industry reaction  Daniel Masters, Director of GAJL, said Jersey prides itself on being among the top-tier jurisdictions when it comes to compliance, which is why the firm chose to base its bitcoin fund in Jersey.  Masters stressed that GAJL is in a good position to manage the fund:  “Global Advisors is thrilled to be able to bring a robust bitcoin fund product to the market. Our long experience in commodities means we are well placed to manage volatility and performance risks in this fast growing and opportunistic asset class.”  GAJL says leading bitcoin service providers are on board, including Netagio and Elliptic, along with reputable legal advisors and fund administrators.  Elliptic told CoinDesk that it will be providing bitcoin custody services to GABI through its insured storage product, Elliptic Vault.  Dr Tom Robinson, COO and co-founder of Elliptic, said:  “We are pleased to be working with the team at GABI, and look forward to helping other businesses and financial institutions to integrate this burgeoning asset class into their existing processes. This new fund is a significant move forwards for digital currencies: demonstrating that regulators are willing to engage with the technology, and further legitimising it.”  Local tech hub Digital Jersey welcomed the news, saying that it will continue to support several business initiatives looking at ways of using cryptocurrencies in the island, including retail outlets and a potential cryptocurrency exchange.  Paul Masterton, Chairman of Digital Jersey believes the decision could attract global interest:  “The news of this regulated bitcoin fund is extremely positive for Jersey, positioning the island for future opportunities and demonstrating how local businesses can combine the advantages of our well-regulated finance industry with innovative technology. While GABI is a regulated expert fund and not yet a general consumer product, the chance to engage with bitcoin in secure environment will be of global interest.”  Regulation and tax implications  While Jersey is widely seen as a tax haven, this does not mean it closes a blind eye to AML and compliance standards. On the contrary, the jurisdiction has a very robust regulatory framework designed to attract potential investors.  The government says it is committed to introducing an “appropriate and proportionate” AML regime in the field of digital currencies too. The government believes, though, that in-depth analysis of the risks posed by cryptocurrency must be carried out before the new AML regime can be introduced.  In terms of tax implications, the island’s Comptroller of Taxes insists all transactions involving cryptocurrencies must be reflected in accounts and they will be taxable under Jersey income tax provisions relating to foreign exchange. The general sales tax due must be calculated using the sterling value of the cryptocurrency at the time it takes place.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Nermin Hajdarbegovic,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/10/first-regulated-bitcoin-investment-fund-to-launch-on-island-of-jersey,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f22daa338603d0379d13a14cd327258b0b48934e-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In April we announced that CoinDesk would be publishing State of Bitcoin updates on a quarterly basis. Given the positive response we have received since 2014’s first report, we are pleased to release our latest update.  This State of Bitcoin Q2 report focuses on data and events in the second quarter of 2014 through to the present day. Here are some of the highlights.  2014 Q2 report highlights  Bitcoin’s price continues to be a key focus.  Some people, including Stanford Professor Susan Athey, have argued that there has been too much emphasis placed on bitcoin’s price. However, looking at the top 10 most read stories on CoinDesk during the second quarter, we see four are about bitcoin price action (Slide 5).            Another top-10 story regarding Mark T Williams' failed prediction of a bitcoin price collapse in Q2 is also arguably price-related. In short, there continues to be very high interest in bitcoin’s price.  Bitcoin’s price bounces back 39%  One of the reasons bitcoin’s price was such a big topic in Q2 is because it witnessed a significant recovery, rising 39.4% during the second quarter.  A number of factors explain bitcoin’s price rebound in the second quarter, including what appears to be a stabilizing regulatory situation in China as well as continued interest in bitcoin by large, well-established brands such as DISH, Expedia, and Apple (Slide 7).            It’s important to note that bitcoin’s price at the end of Q2 is still 15% below where it started in 2014 and 33% below its 2014 high on 6th January, when it reached $951.39 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  VC investments in bitcoin up 28%  While Q1 was very positive for bitcoin in terms of venture capital (with $57m invested), the second quarter saw $73m invested – a 28% increase over Q1 (Slide 17).  If we include the early Q3 2014 VC investments we’ve seen (notably Xapo’s recent $20m round), a total of $240m has been invested in bitcoin startups since 2012, and $150m (63%) has come in 2014 YTD alone.  VC investment forecast increased by 42%  One of the more widely discussed elements of the Q1 State of Bitcoin report was our comparison of investment in early Internet and early bitcoin startups.  VCs such as Marc Andreessen have compared bitcoin’s overall potential, as well as its current stage of development, to the Internet circa 1993. Our comparison was meant to assess whether VCs are backing up their lofty bitcoin statements with their wallets.  Notwithstanding a number of methodological issues which we discussed previously with making this comparison – including inflation and changes over time in the cost of launching a startup – we feel the comparison is still interesting and useful.  In April we were projecting a total of $200m invested in bitcoin startups for 2014. While close, this figure still trailed 1995 early-stage Internet investment by a significant margin. However, based on recent investments, including the aforementioned $20m Xapo round, we are now projecting a total of $284.5m to be invested in bitcoin startups this year.  This figure would comfortably exceed the $250m invested in first sequence Internet startups in 1995 (Slide 18).  The 2014 run rate for publicly-disclosed VC investment in bitcoin startups would also be over 3 times more than the total investment VCs made in bitcoin startups in 2013.  In short, the ‘wall of money’ flowing towards cryptocurrency startups continues to grow and will continue to have a positive impact on the industry’s prospects.  8 million wallets, 100,000 merchants in 2014  We have been working on expanding our database of key bitcoin data so that we can more closely monitor bitcoin’s progress and make forecasts on key adoption metrics, such as wallet use and merchant acceptance.  So that you can have a quick, one-page dashboard that measures bitcoin's progress, we are introducing our Key Bitcoin Adoption Metrics (Slide 42).  For the first time, we are also making year-end forecasts for the total number of bitcoin wallets (Slide 28) and the total number of bitcoin-accepting businesses (Slide 30).  Why not come back in two quarters to see how we’ve done with these forecasts?  In the meantime, we hope you enjoy the State of Bitcoin Q2 2014 report and CoinDesk's other Research Reports.

42425874,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglFh,1404981412,Coinfloor Boosts Team With Ex-Goldman Sachs Exec,"UK-based bitcoin exchange Coinfloor has appointed a former managing director from both Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse as its executive chairman today.  The new hiring, Adam Knight, has served as a managing director of the investment banking division of Credit Suisse and as global head of metals within the commodities group at Goldman Sachs.  The exchange's co-founder and CEO Mark Lamb said:  ""We are extremely pleased to welcome Adam Knight as our executive chairman. His experience in growing and managing massive commodities markets and expertise of regulatory compliance, risk and governance procedures will be invaluable in establishing Coinfloor as the most trusted bitcoin exchange in the world.""  Coinfloor says the new hire is part of its commitment to create a ""the world's first trustworthy and fully compliant bitcoin exchange"".  Watching bitcoin  Knight told CoinDesk that he had been tracking bitcoin's progress for a year or so and had been impressed with how robust it had proved over ""significant shocks"", including the Mt. Gox affair. He added:  ""Having been severely tested and yet continue to grow, I decided to start allocating a proportion of my savings to bitcoin and began looking for bitcoin infrastructure companies to invest in.""  Knight's career trading commodity markets has provided him with a good understanding of the exchange, clearing house and storage models, he said. Consequently, he wanted to find a team building a platform in this area ""with the right skills and approach to build a robust global bitcoin financial services business.""  This search led him to Coinfloor, which he said is ""building a bitcoin exchange and storage company that will become a leader in the sector [...] because [it is] focused on the key principles of trust, security and transparency.""  Industry trend  Coinfloor's appointment is the latest in a series of senior hirings in the cryptocurrency space, as maturing bitcoin startups seek to boost confidence in their companies and bring valuable experience on board from finance or tech sector giants.  In June, BitPay hired ex-Visa executive Tim Byun as its chief compliance officer. In May, both CoinBase and itBit hired senior staff from the likes of Facebook, PayPal and Amazon.  Coinfloor also made headlines last month after announcing it would accept domestic deposits via local bank transfer to accelerate its UK payments services.  Currently, the UK has limited options for bitcoin exchanges that provide fiat payment options other than relatively expensive foreign transfers, so Coinfloor is competitively positioned.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Daniel Palmer,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/10/coinfloor-boosts-team-with-ex-goldman-sachs-exec,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/43e45074f6a0ccc22a760b368b272d61698ace86-1260x1016.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42425878,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIglRh,1404955517,Pantera Launches BitIndex to Track Bitcoin,"Pantera Capital, an investment fund that focuses on bitcoin, has announced an index it says will allow investors to track the cryptocurrency over a medium-term timeframe.  Dubbed the BitIndex, it takes into account seven different factors that Pantera believes accurately charts bitcoin's overall progress.  What’s interesting is Pantera Capital is not including price in the BitIndex, instead tracking other data sources that it believes lends to bitcoin’s technological progression.  In the fund’s monthly report for June, Pantera stated:  “While some other indices also offer guidance (such as trade in USD), we chose not to include them because of unreliable data, limited availability, or other statistical problems.”  Components of index  The seven measures that the BitIndex includes, in order of importance, is as follows:    Developer interest on GitHub.  Merchant adoption as a measure of consumer adoption.  Wikipedia views measuring bitcoin education.  Hashrate by logarithmic scale corresponding to orders of magnitude.  Google searches captured by the number of times “bitcoin” appears.  User adoption as measured by wallets.  Transaction volume on the bitcoin network.    Pantera's letter does not indicate how it calculates the merchant adoption metric, although statistics for hashrate, user adoption by wallets and transaction volume are publicly available from a number of different data sources.  Information from websites such as GitHub for developer interest, as well as Wikipedia and Google to identify mainstream interest and popularity, is also readily available.  While it appears the BitIndex closely followed pricing movements in the latter half of last year, measurements the fund uses show that, despite negative news events like Mt. Gox and the US Marshals' BTC auction, bitcoin is on an uptrend.  Always about price  BitIndex offers a different look at technological aspects of bitcoin rather than infatuation with the cryptocurrency’s valuation.  In fact, the firm says that it is value distortions that influenced the creation of BitIndex, specifying, ""price manipulation at Mt. Gox and/or the Chinese and in the first quarter of 2014 due to the collapse of Mt. Gox"", as problems defining bitcoin's true worth.  There is a lot of interest in bitcoin's value, and the vast number of exchanges with different prices has created a need for composite pricing information.  CoinDesk has its Bitcoin Price Index and the Winklevoss twins, who are major investors in bitcoin and are trying to launch an ETF for the cryptocurrency, also have the creatively named Winkdex.  However, Pantera states unequivocally in its letter that the BitIndex gives people a longer-range view of bitcoin than what price indexes offer:  ""Pantera has developed the BitIndex to inform our views on bitcoin. It is not a tool to forecast bitcoin’s price. This index is designed to assist us in forming our views on what may happen to bitcoin in the medium term.""  Focus on investing  While the BitIndex may provide a glimpse into where bitcoin is going, it is questionable whether it offers insight into the bitcoin economy's adoption rate as a store of value – seemingly something Pantera's investment clients would be wanting the firm to do.  “The index looks at the interest level across a couple key populations: general public, users, developers, and merchants, and should be a pretty accurate judge of the overall growth of bitcoin"", said Andy Beal, a lawyer with Crowley Strategy that advises bitcoin startups.  He added, however:  ""The only group that was not included that can really affect growth is investors.""  Pantera  is backed by Fortress Investment Group, Ribbit Capital and Benchmark Partners. Its focus on bitcoin began in 2013, and the firm invests directly in BTC as well as funds startups that operate within the industry.  Bloomberg's company overview information indicates that, prior to concentrating on bitcoin, Pantera Capital previously invested in public equity, fixed income, currency and commodity markets.
