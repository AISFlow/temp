CoinFLEX's issuance of $47 million in tokens comes after a certain individual’s account went into negative equity during recent market volatility. The issuance will begin tomorrow and likely run until July 1, CoinFLEX wrote in a white paper Monday.  ""In normal circumstances, we would auto-liquidate a position that runs low on equity at prices that are prior to the zero-equity price,"" the company wrote.  CoinFLEX described the customer as ""high integrity"" individual with liquidity issues tied to the recent crash in crypto and noncrypto markets who has ""significant shareholdings in several unicorn private companies and a large portfolio.""  CoinFLEX said the issuance includes a 20% annual percentage rate (APR) accrued and paid daily in rvUSD.  ""We have been speaking to potential large buyers and believe there is significant interest in the terms presented,"" CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb said in a blog post.  CoinFLEX expects to resume withdrawals June 30, but is still subject to receiving funds pursuant to the rvUSD issuance.  When asked of a potential bank run on Bloomberg TV Monday evening, CEO Mark Lamb said he’s unconcerned this scenario would occur as customers can withdraw their funds once the new token fundraise is complete. Lamb also said CoinFLEX plans to boost transparency for future positions, notional value of accounts, margin, and will use an external auditing firm to do so.

As network activity had grown, so had the transaction volumes. The effects continue to linger even into the bear market, although fluctuations between low and high are now more common in the space. Presently, transaction volumes have fallen sharply and ETH fees have now plummeted to monthly lows. Ethereum Transactions At $0.5 Ethereum transaction fees have declined to one of their lowest points this year.

Dylan and Ian Macalinao, who are best known for creating stablecoin swapping protocol Saber, are rebranding their developer collective, Ship Capital. Protagonist, as the fund is now known, has raised at least $33 million, according to its website and regulatory documents.  The Saber brothers’ new push means two prolific Solana ecosystem contributors will now officially split their time between building crypto projects and investing in them.  That sparked some concern among the space’s more entrenched VCs; multiple told CoinDesk that doing both efforts well requires “focus” that’s hard to find.  ""I don't think it inspires confidence that they're committed to the protocol, but it is commonly accepted, with lots of prominent examples,"" a third VC said, naming Robert Leshner and Tarun Chitra’s Robot Ventures as one.  Protagonist lists four people with the title “co-founder and GP” – brothers Dylan and Ian, plus fintech company Pipe’s CEO, Henry Hurst, and George Bousis, a self-described angel investor. Corporate attorney Sevan Avakian is Protagonist’s general counsel and partner, and Jiani Chen is an investment partner, the website said Sunday. Monday night it had dropped the ""General Partner"" descriptions for the brothers, Hurst and Bousis.  “Protagonist is building and investing in future-defining crypto companies and protocols,” the website said. It has so far deployed into layer 1 blockchain contender Aptos, a programmable non-fungible token (NFT) startup called Cardinal, the neobank Cogni and decentralized finance platform Delta One.  The rebranding of Ship Capital (regulatory documents capture the name change) reflects its shift from a GitHub contributor collaborative into a bonafide venture capital firm.  That pivot has not come naturally: both brothers have publicly stated their “group of friends” who coded was simply that.  “It’s not a VC, and we as an entity have never made any investments, nor do we plan to any time soon,” Ian tweeted last November. Two months prior, Dylan had said much the same.  Corporate records indicate “any time soon” was not long at all. “Ship Capital Labs US, LP” registered in Delaware in late January 2022; it recognized its name change to “Protagonist US LP” in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on May 23.

42421521,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYN3,1656362691,Ms. Crypto Goes to Washington,"Crypto clearly is going mainstream. The drama of the recent bust cycle in the recurring boom-and-bust in crypto prices provided a dramatic backdrop to the introduction of the Lummis-Gillibrand Responsible Financial Innovation Act, laying out a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrency.  Its introduction received extensive fanfare in the media.  Adelle Nazarian is the CEO of the American Blockchain PAC, which protects innovation in blockchain and digital assets in the U.S. and opposes legislation that limits the growth of crypto assets.  Todd August White is Managing Partner of Rulon & White Governance Strategies and the founder of the American Blockchain PAC.  Don’t worry, this column won’t go too deep into the weeds. For specifics, see the official section by section overview and commentary by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) at Medium.  At the risk of being slightly impolitic, this legislation signals the mainstreaming of crypto. But it won’t be enacted this year.  Virtually all political junkies believe that the congressional deck is going to be thoroughly shuffled this coming November. Therefore, the bill’s longer-term prospects are also in question.  Additionally, this legislation – while technically bipartisan – was introduced with just two sponsors. Neither dominates even one of the four committees of jurisdiction (agriculture, on which Sen. Gillibrand serves; banking, on which Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) serves; intelligence; and finance) which it will have to navigate to get to the floor.  Much less, there is no sign of its commanding a 60-vote majority to carry it over the formidable filibuster hurdle. Even gaining a simple majority is no mulligan. The left is already saying that it does not regulate hard enough. The Center for American Progress critiqued it as, “The status quo would be better than this bill.”  Read More: Yellen Call for 'Responsible' Crypto Innovation Is Right  Meanwhile, most Republicans will likely see it as regulating too much. Even if Senate passage is secured, Republican House passage and a Biden signature are not to be taken for granted.  The cryptoscenti are grateful for finally having something bipartisan with which to work. Many advocacy groups wish to stay in the sponsors’ good graces. Thus, most crypto advocates are too political to inventory the many hurdles. That said, let’s code switch here.  This legislation does represent an authentic rite of passage: Ms. Crypto goes to Washington!  In theory, a great leap forward for cryptocurrency! That said, as America’s greatest yogi, Yogi Berra, taught us, “In theory there is no difference between theory and practice but in practice there is.”  There are a lot of crucial details to be dealt with, in practice.  Unlikely passage  Let’s celebrate how the legislation’s debut included a marquee appearance by both Senate sponsors at Washington Post Live's “The Evolution of Money: Cryptocurrency Regulation.” That policypalooza also featured the Rostin Behnam, chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC); Dante Disparte, chief strategy officer and head of global policy at Circle; and Tomicah Tillemann, global chief policy officer at Haun Ventures.  Disparte and Tillemann nicely summed up the general consensus in the room and in the media: The bill is unlikely to be enacted in the 117th Congress. Yet, they legitimately applauded it as a first step toward a comprehensive regulatory structure to protect the public without stifling the sector.  With a great deal of important matters still to be ironed out.  How great a deal? As capitalism’s inventor, Adam Smith, responded after the surrender of British Gen. Burgoyne at Saratoga, the turning point in the American Revolution, “There’s a great deal of ruin in a nation.”  The foundational premise of Lummis-Gillibrand seems to be to sort blockchain assets into two categories. The largest, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), are to be treated as virtual commodities, regulated by the CFTC. Parallel to that, are thousands – the vast majority, of smaller cryptocurrencies – to be sorted out pursuant to a codified “Howey Test” and, mostly, treated as securities to be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The Senators were emphatic about how extensively they consulted with the SEC and the CFTC in drafting the legislation. What is unclear is how the associated compliance costs, which can easily be prohibitive to early-stage startups, were quantified or are to be constrained.  Chair Gary Gensler’s SEC has taken an aggressive regulatory posture. It does not have a history as an easygoing regulator. The proposed legislation also would take the U.S. out of the algorithmic stablecoin race forever. This, presumably, is in reaction to Terra's $40 billion LUNA debacle.  Yet, it overlooks the success (to date) of Frax.finance. Is there a baby being thrown out with the bathwater?  The biggest handicap which Lummis-Gillibrand appears to face (assuming a regulation-skeptical Republican resurgence) is less in its details, however significant, but more so in its fundamentally regulatory-heavy posture.  The Big Reveals at the presentation were of the senators’ greater coziness with the regulators than with the innovators. These were presented in impromptu statements by Sens. Lummis and Gillibrand at The Post event.  Most concerning was an unscripted comment by Sen. Gillibrand calling not only for prospective regulation of Web3 (the category into which crypto presumably falls) but a push for retroactive regulation of the web itself (especially Web 2.0, presumably meaning social media). Sen. Gillibrand in her own words:  ""If we get Web3 right, we can then maybe go back and look at Web 2.0 and say what would a data protection agency look like, to begin to look at that.”  Wait. What?  Despite its flaws, the worldwide web, including social media, has proven one of the great technology success stories in history; a multitrillion-dollar contribution to the U.S. economy and to America’s dominance of the commanding heights of tech.  Read More: SEC Chair Gensler Suggests Lummis-Gillibrand Bill May ‘Undermine’ Market Protections  Sen. Gillibrand thus casually revealed an extreme regulatory agenda: a promise to extensively regulate the web, Web3 and retroactively Web 2.0. This is unlikely to climb the wall of attracting 10 Republicans to afford passage through the Senate.  Big Reg will probably run into headwinds from a House that will likely be controlled by anti-regulation Republicans after the 2022 midterms. This does not bode well for prospects of passage.  As for the Bitcoin-friendly (but not so much crypto-friendly) and somewhat more conservative Sen. Lummis, her own admissions at the debut of her signature crypto legislation give pause. Washington Post reporter Tory Newmyer asked about the major entry of crypto into the lobbying and advocacy process in the capital, noting the $5 million the industry had invested in the former.  “How is that making a difference on the Hill?” Newmyer asked.  To which Sen. Lummis replied:  “Oh, I don't know because I had no idea that was happening …”  Wait. What?  The co-sponsor of an ambitious piece of comprehensive legislation candidly confesses that she was unaware of the industry’s engagement. By their own frank admission, the Senate co-sponsors spent a great deal more time talking to the federal regulators than to the regulated. That does not bode well for the prospects of passage.  To paraphrase French Gen. Bosquet's comment on the Charge of the Light Brigade: “C’est magnifique, mais c’est pas les politiques, c’est de la folie.”  Bitcoin has not decoupled  And when asked why bitcoin (of which Sen. Lummis is a HODLer) has not seen its price act as a hedge against inflation, losing more than half its dollar value while inflation approaches double digits, Sen. Lummis responded: “Well, that's a great question. I would have expected it to decouple from the stock market. It has not done that.”  Wait. What?  The co-sponsor of an ambitious piece of comprehensive legislation candidly confesses that the market is not supporting a fundamental predicate of her proposed regulatory structure?  That does not bode well for the prospects of passage.  Economist Friedrich Hayek devoted his Nobel Prize in economics acceptance speech to an indictment of what he called “scientism,” in which the economics profession adopted the form, but not the substance, of science. Hayek: “It is often difficult enough for the expert, and certainly in many instances impossible for the layman, to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate claims advanced in the name of science.”  Classical liberals – like those of us here at the American Blockchain PAC – enthusiastically embrace the essential role of the rule of law. It’s libertarian doctrine!  That said, we are far more optimistic about the power of organic market forces, under the rule of law, to facilitate equitable prosperity while protecting the public from force, fraud or coercion than we are about ambitious regulatory structures. Especially regulatory structures that have gone off the rails even before the train has left the legislative station.  In the words of the chairman of our advisory board, blockchain inventor Dr. W. Scott Stornetta, “Let freedom ring!”  Tipping our hat to Jimmy Stewart, we applaud the debut of “Ms. Crypto Goes to Washington,” produced and directed by Cynthia Lummis and Kristen Gillibrand. Brava!  Next let’s take to heart the words of its protagonist, Sen. Jefferson Smith:  “Get up there with the lady that’s up on top of this Capitol dome, that lady that stands for liberty.”  Lummis-Gillibrand signals the mainstreaming of crypto. It is historic.  Now, let’s just invite in Lady Freedom – “the lady that’s up on top of this Capitol dome” – to achieve blockbuster status.

42423017,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zo1h,1656362146,Market Wrap: Recession Fears Halt Crypto Bounce,"Hi, I'm Krisztian Sandor, here to take you through the day's crypto market highlights and news.  Bitcoin (BTC) traded at about $20,800 Monday afternoon, paring some of its gains from last week.  The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is holding ground above the key $20,000 level, but analysts aren't optimistic about the prospects for a sustained rally, Jimmy He reported today.  EToro’s crypto analyst Simon Peters said that crypto has suffered from the same toxic mix of poor company earnings, inflation and central bank rate hikes that have hurt stocks and other assets this year. Crypto prices have correlated increasingly to equity indexes, particularly those with a heavy technology component. Oanda senior market analyst Craig Erlam said that fizzling bitcoin rallies reflect an overall downbeat sentiments about riskier assets.  On Monday, however, panic over troubled crypto lender Celsius Network and insolvent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital seemed to ease. Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, told CoinDesk that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index is easing.  Greenberg said that he was ""watching the 200-week SMA (simple moving average) at $22,650 as the key price we need to regain and hold to see a return to higher trading ranges across the crypto sector.”  Most other cryptocurrencies slid on Monday. Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, was recently changing hands at just below $1,200, down 2.3% during the last 24 hours. Polygon’s MATIC token, which was one of last week's biggest gainers, led the declines among altcoins, falling 9.8%.  In traditional markets, the fear of a recession curbed the optimism that fueled last week’s bounce, as bearish sentiment among investors increased 11.4 percentage points to 58.3%, while bullish sentiment dropped to 19.4%, according to the AAII short-term investor optimism survey that market research firm Macro Hive cited in a note.  The S&P 500 traded fell 0.3%, and the Nasdaq index was down 0.8%.  Industrial metals such as copper and tin are on track to have their worst quarter since the financial crisis in 2008, Bloomberg reported, underscoring the looming prospect of a recession.  “We are in a bear market, and it is a bear that will probably keep growling,"" Bilal Hafeez, CEO and research head at Macro Hive, wrote in a newsletter.

Grayscale Lines Up Jane Street and Virtu as 'Authorized Participants' if GBTC Converts to ETF  By Michael Bellusci  Grayscale Investments said Monday it would work with market-making heavyweights Jane Street and Virtu Financial as authorized participants should its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) gain Securities and Exchange Commission approval to be converted into an ETF.  ""Authorized participants"" are specialized traders who can create and redeem shares of an ETF.  A decision on Grayscale's ETF application is due on or before July 6, and the heavy betting is that the SEC will deny the proposal. Nevertheless, CEO Michael Sonnenshein reiterated his company's ""unequivocal"" commitment to converting GBTC from a trust to a spot ETF.  The owner of the $13.5 billion Grayscale Bitcoin Trust awaits an imminent decision from the SEC on its spot Bitcoin ETF proposal. GBTC trades at a nearly 30% discount to net asset value – an amount that would be quickly erased were the trust to become an ETF.

42423021,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1zo9h,1656361762,Solana’s Biggest DeFi Lender Almost Got Rekt. Then Binance Stepped In,"What happens when there’s a multimillion-dollar margin call and no one picks up the phone?  That eerie prospect threatened to become a nightmarish reality last week for Solend, Solana’s second-biggest decentralized finance (DeFi) outpost. Its single-largest user – a wallet with $107 million in USDC borrowed against $170 million in SOL collateral – was on the verge of liquidation and completely MIA.  Developers tried Reddit posts, on-chain messages, even Twitter memes, hoping to alert the anonymous account of its impending fate. The whale account needed to either pony up more collateral or reduce its position to ward off a catastrophic on-chain liquidation that, project leads said, could crash Solend – and maybe even Solana.  The frantic rush to save Solend exploded into a governance and power controversy that elicited accusations of DeFi hypocrisy on Crypto Twitter and beyond.  Ultimately, it was CeFi giant Binance who woke the whale, Solend’s pseudonymous co-founder Rooter told CoinDesk. The world’s largest crypto exchange delivered a message to the account on Rooter’s behalf.  “I’m sorry that this issue has caused concern in the Solana community and with the Solana team,” the user emailed Rooter on June 21, according to screenshots shared with CoinDesk. “There’s no hard feelings about the recent governance proposal.”  Read more: DeFi Protocol Solend Passes Governance Vote to Reverse ‘Emergency Powers’  After establishing contact, the whale began redistributing its Solend bets into other Solana DeFi outposts like Mango Markets – ending the most acute crisis without a single cascading liquidation. The price of SOL has recovered enough to quiet all the chaos – despite the heavy dose of momentary schadenfreude.  Messy cocktail  Solend’s liquidation debacle came as the turbulent crypto markets rattled DeFi protocols of all stripes, pushing purportedly decentralized governing bodies to make tough decisions that affect protocol users in lasting ways.  That can make for a messy cocktail. In “decentralized finance,” programmatic smart contract code – devoid of the human biases that might, say, prompt a banker to refuse a loan to a minority group – is meant to be the immutable law of the land.  Of course, reality is more complicated.  Solend’s crisis emerged because its protocol had set no limits on how big a borrower could be. That result: A single whale accounted for the vast majority of Solend’s SOL collateral and USDC loans. That collateral was at risk of liquidation if the price of SOL fell too low.  Solend’s smart contracts automatically send liquidation sell orders to DEXs when user collateral falls too low. They’re pure, programmatic. They don’t holistically check to see if a trade will crash the markets, or worse, the chain.  Zero day  While billions of dollars in SOL trade hands every day, most of that action happens on centralized exchanges, not over the much more thinly traded DEXs, where DeFi cousin Solend routes its trades. DEXs don’t have enough liquidity to soak up the whale’s dump, meaning SOL’s price would crash – perhaps 60% or 80% – until buyers arbitraged it back up.  That itself was a problem, Rooter said: “It’s such a crazy art arbitrage opportunity and liquidation opportunity that bots would just flock.” That type of activity has crashed the entire Solana blockchain in the past.  Solend was sure to take the brunt of the pain. It would be left with bad debt, a depleted treasury, and a disenchanted user base. “It’s basically over for us and our users will lose a ton of money,” Rooter said, explaining what would happen if the smart contracts did what they were designed to do.  “We really have to do something now,” he said, recalling the outreach effort.  One missed call  Bankers in traditional finance can address a comparable snafu with a “margin call” to clients whereby they lay out the stakes and explain the need for more collateral to secure a loan. After all, they know their counterparties’ identities; the borrower is a phone call or email away. That’s not the case with pseudonymous DeFi (though a handful of startups are working on inter-wallet messaging solutions, none of which Solend used).  Unable to broadcast their message privately, Rooter took the plea for the whale’s attention public on Twitter. This spooked users into pulling their money from Solend en masse, emptying the vaults much as would happen in a bank run. Rooter admits the tweets backfired.  “It kind of exacerbated our problems because then not only were we dealing with a risk that something might happen, but we’re dealing with an immediate problem that people’s funds were frozen.”  Their solution was a controversial proposal to grant Solend Labs “emergency powers” over the whale’s collateral. Once in control, the caretaker company would “gracefully” liquidate the whale via off-chain, over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks and in effect sidestep the market zero day. It would turn the USDC back over to the whale, resolve the crisis and right the markets.  That said, it would overrule the smart contracts designed to be in control.  And that’s where the optics became painful.  Governance  Many DeFi protocols put code changes up to the community. Their token holders get to vote on new listings, rate hikes, partnerships, that sort of thing. The bigger the user’s token trove, the weightier its opinion. It’s an imperfect system for managing purportedly decentralized systems, albeit a popular one.  Solend hadn’t ever held a DAO vote before. But Rooter said it needed to put the controversial solution before the community. On June 19, it proposed SLND1, the “emergency powers” package. Six hours later, the vote passed by 97.5% with just enough participation to meet the 1% quorum.  Read more: Solana DeFi Platform Votes to Control Whale Account in Bid to Avoid Liquidation 'Chaos'  Beneath SLND1’s apparent landslide was a less savory picture: a single wallet with 1.01% of the turnout tokens (a ballot whale, if you will) made the difference. Without its participation, SLND1 would have failed to reach quorum and flopped on the technical. It only passed in the affirmative because it voted in the affirmative.  Rooter said Solend’s team asked the ballot whale to vote after fretting over SLND1 low turnout. He said they did not ask the whale, who is active on Discord to vote yes or no, only that they participate. The ballot whale obliged.  “Users of the protocol have generally been very supportive. And then the critics tend to be like people on Twitter who have no stake or no deposits,” Rooter said.  SLND1’s critics were so loud and the media coverage so fierce that Rooter and the team proposed a new vote, SLND2, that would invalidate the first. It, too, passed after the ballot whale stepped in.  “The whale, again, basically swayed the whole vote,” Rooter said.  After a lot of hemming and hawing – the whale didn’t want to act just to appease “Crypto Twitter’s armchair experts,” Rooter said – as well as tech hiccups, the ballot whale voted yes with 14 seconds to spare.  A final, June 21 vote on SLND3 saw the community approve what is effectively a new borrower ceiling at $50 million. This too was designed to mitigate whale risk. (It also passed with the ballot whale’s critical “yes” vote).  By this point Rooter’s parallel outreach effort had finally yielded fruit: Binance had gotten the borrower whale’s attention, and they were in contact via email. Over the next couple of days, the situation slowly resolved.  Binance declined to comment on the Solend situation.  A spokesperson at the exchange confirmed it has been an intermediary between project teams and account holders in the past. The spokesperson said Binance never shares information without its users permission.  The recovery  There’s plenty of repetitional damage. Observers from Solana’s VC community told CoinDesk they feared Solend had suffered an insurmountable setback with its series of governance votes.  It is “inertia versus terrible governance decisions,” said one researcher on Monday. He wasn’t sure which force would win.  Solend’s total value locked (TVL) has dropped 10% over the last week and nearly 60% in a month while second-tier Solana DeFi lenders such as Larix, Hubble and Oxygen have fared far better. Mango Markets has gotten the lion’s share of the whale redistribution.  Speaking to CoinDesk last Friday, Rooter struck a hopeful tone. By then, Solend had steered through the crisis without suffering a catastrophic liquidation.  “I think this sentiment is kind of improving. I mean, the PR blowback has also blown over at this point. Solend lost a bunch of TVL. But, you know, people can use it now,” Rooter said.  Solend remains the second-biggest DeFi project on Solana.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | BNB,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/06/27/solanas-biggest-defi-lender-almost-got-rekt-then-binance-stepped-in,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3890b507028984661a73dc21302319db53b9c687-2000x1357.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Before seeing what the Bitcoin Mayer Multiple does, it&apos;s best to look at a basic explanation of a &apos;moving average&apos; first. A moving average (or MA in short) is an analytical tool that averages out the value of any quantity over a specific period of time. As its name implies, it moves forward along with the quantity, and changes its value accordingly. An MA can be taken over any timespan, whether that be 100 days, 72 hours, or even10 seconds. Related Reading | Why Pain May Not Be Over For Bitcoin Holders Just Yet The bigger MAs are usually quite useful for long-term analysis as they smooth out any irrelevant short-term fluctuations. One popular moving average for Bitcoin is the 200-day MA, which has historically indicated a bear market whenever the price has went below it, and a bull market whenever the price has crossed over it. Now, what the Mayer Multiple does is measure how much the price of the crypto has deviated from this 200-day MA.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at $20,737, down 3% over the past 24 hours.  Oanda Senior Market Analyst Craig Erlam said that fizzling bitcoin rallies likely reflect downbeat sentiments in the current market, which have curbed upside momentum due to higher interest rates and widespread risk aversion.  “Traders are clearly taking a very conservative view of the space and that may not change any time soon,” Erlam said.  Simon Peters, a crypto-market analyst with eToro, said that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy – including interest rate hikes amid rising inflation – can also affect crypto markets.  “Whether further raising of rates is priced into markets or whether it continues to affect valuations remains to be seen,” Peters said. “Increasing recession risks, poor earnings and forward guidance from companies could further affect stock market prices. Given the recent correlations, crypto prices could also be affected.”  Ether (ETH) was down 3.6% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1,187.

""Authorized participants"" are specialized traders that can create and redeem shares of an ETF.  A decision on Grayscale's ETF application is due on or before July 6, and the heavy betting is that the SEC will deny the proposal. Nevertheless, CEO Michael Sonnenshein this morning reiterated his company's ""unequivocal"" commitment to converting GBTC from a trust to a spot ETF.  Additionally, Grayscale earlier this month hired high-powered attorney and former Obama administration official Donald B. Verrilli to assist in those efforts, and has made little secret of its intent to take the SEC to court should the agency deny the ETF application.  GBTC currently trades at nearly a 30% discount to net asset value – an amount that would be quickly erased were the trust to become an ETF.  Bloomberg first reported the authorized-participants news, with Grayscale's VP of communications, Jennifer Rosenthal confirming the details to CoinDesk.  Virtu Financial earlier this month said it sees a market-making opportunity in crypto as demand for the asset class grows. It's working with Citadel Securities on creating a crypto marketplace.

In a bullish breakout, LSK may rally to retest June 2022 highs in a continuation pattern, building on recent gains. Past Performance of Lisk Currently, the Lisk crypto prices are solid, adding double digits against the USDT. Clearly, from the daily chart, the coin also trades above the middle BB and is back within a $0.80 trade range. Considering the expansion of LSK coin prices on June 27, traders may look for bullish entries in subsequent sessions. Lisk Technical Analysis The path of least resistance is northwards, as per the LSK token crypto formation in the daily chart. Even though the long upper wick points to liquidation and rejection of higher highs in lower time frames, there are bullish signals. Accordingly, risk-on, optimistic traders may search for loading opportunities on every correction lower with targets at $1.45. This preview is valid because of the ultra-high trading volumes propelling Lisk coin prices today. Therefore, with the LSK token holding above the middle BB and $1, buyers have the upper hand. What to Expect from LSK? Per the LSK technical analysis in the daily chart, buyers are confident. Since the Lisk token is above the middle BB and $1, there is a chance for the coin to retest June 2022 highs.The post Lisk Technical Analysis: LSK Buyers Targeting $1.45 appeared first on Cryptoknowmics-Crypto News and Media Platform.",POSITIVE,USDT,ICO | MARKET | TRADING | USDT,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/lisk-technical-analysis-lsk-buyers-targeting-1-45/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=lisk-technical-analysis-lsk-buyers-targeting-1-45,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

The platform has already been experimenting with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Web3 experiences, and it is now looking to find ways to create content and distribute it on Fox’s platform, all while taking baby steps, according to the company’s CEO.  “We believe we can leverage the Fox platform to teach people what it means [for] them to value a digital good [and] the value of an NFT,” Blockchain Creative Labs CEO Scott Greenberg said during an interview with CoinDesk at NFT.NYC.  The Web3 native platform launched with a tie-in with the Fox prime-time series “The Masked Singer,” releasing NFT packs via the MaskVerse, which lets users purchase collectibles using a credit card or crypto.  Read more: ‘We’re Poor Again, but We’re Still Here’: Why NFT.NYC Won’t Die  Those efforts were followed by IRL experiences at music festivals like South by Southwest.  In June of last year, Fox tapped Greenberg, who was then the CEO of animation studios Bento Box Entertainment, to lead the network's efforts to develop “Krapopolis,” an animated series that would live entirely on the blockchain.  The partnership also marked Fox’s commitment to NFTs, placing $100 million behind the project. “Krapopolis,” derived from “Rick and Morty,” will air next fall on Hulu, Greenberg said.  NFT holders of “Krapopolis” will have gated access to videos and be able to view behind-the-scenes archives as well as potentially get a chance to view early episodes and early shopping at exclusive merchandise stores.  Read more: Fox TV Puts $100M Behind Its NFT-Driven Blockchain Experiment  This, however, isn’t the platform’s first venture into Web3. In October of last year, shortly after its MaskVerse launch, it inked a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) to launch a WWE NFT marketplace that would cater to licensed WWE tokens, including collectibles.  Now, nearly eight months later, Greenberg told CoinDesk it would be launching Moonsault, which will include flips, or classic moments, for the WWE community, on the WWE marketplace.  On July 1, the creative lab is planning to launch another NFT and WWE adjacent event centered around “Money in the Bank,” but details remain unclear.  Moreover, earlier this year, the studio launched a player's token in a partnership with the U.S. Football League. On June 24, the lab debuted a “team token.” Users who participate have the opportunity to buy tokens that are released by the players.  “The great thing about these tokens is the majority of the revenue goes to the players,” Greenberg said. “Over 50% will go to the player'' while Fox will receive less than 50%.  When asked whether people are ready to interact with Web3, Greenberg notes that it is ""inevitable"" and points to people ages 18 to 34 as an example of the next generation of users who will lead that shift.  Still, Greenberg adds that there is a lot of fear and misunderstanding, and the platform’s efforts are meant to ease some of that gray area. “What we want to do is be the adult in the room,” he said.  He added that the platform’s projects are meant to show consumers the value and protection that NFTs and Web3 can provide. The wide range of projects will live on multiple blockchains, Greenberg added, including Eluvio as well as layer 2 solutions like Polygon that live on the Ethereum blockchain.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | FIAT | MATIC,Fran Velasquez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/27/web3-adoption-is-inevitable-blockchain-creative-labs-ceo-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/518fe8f1ed2ed8967291e795c568868f84c14ab6-1270x654.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423010,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy1znjh,1656346771,"Recent Crypto 'Bloodbath' Is Not Necessarily Bad, Regulators Say","Crypto executives and regulators don’t often see eye to eye, but they seem to agree that the recent crypto market turmoil could prove to be positive for the industry by helping filter out unsustainable projects and bad actors.  At least that was the prevailing consensus at the inaugural Point Zero Forum, an invite-only meeting of investors and policymakers that took place in Zurich last week.  Crypto’s total market capitalization is about $1 trillion, down from an October high of $2.7 trillion, according to CoinGecko data.  “There’s a bloodbath going on,” Ravi Menon, managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, said at a panel on the future of financial services on Wednesday, referring to the billions of dollars – and companies – leaving the market.  The collapse of the once $18 billion algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) in May sent shock waves through the industry. Since then, hedge fund Three Arrows Capital revealed it had suffered heavy losses while multibillion-dollar crypto lender Celsius Network froze withdrawals.  Prominent crypto firms around the world, including U.S.-based Coinbase and Gemini as well as Europe’s Bitpanda, have slashed hiring.  Menon says the exodus could help weed out bad actors.  “This is not necessarily bad,” Menon said. “For a regulator, a central bank, it’s a great opportunity to separate the wheat from the chaff.”  Read more: How Crypto Lender Celsius Overheated  Also on the panel, Jon Cunliffe, a deputy governor at the Bank of England, likened the market crash to the dot-com bubble, where excessive speculation led to U.S. tech stock valuations ballooning in the 1990s before the bubble burst in 2000.  “A lot of companies went, but the technology didn't go away, and it came back 10 years later,” Cunliffe said, pointing to survivors such as Amazon. “So whatever happens over the next few months to crypto assets that people trade, I expect crypto technology and finance to continue.”  Fast-tracking regulations  The recent market meltdown underlines the growing urgency for establishing regulations for the industry.  On June 7, U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced a wide-ranging bill that would govern crypto-asset service providers and includes detailed disclosure requirements for stablecoin issuers in light of Terra’s downfall.  The European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) bill, which also lays out requirements for stablecoin issuers, is moving ahead in the legislative process and the U.K. announced in April that it was planning to introduce a regulatory package for crypto and to regulate stablecoins under existing payments legislation.  Crypto firms and regulators need to put the effort into make the industry more sustainable, Agustín Carstens, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, a central bank-owned financial institution, said during the conference in Zurich.  “The degree of leverage in many of these transactions is completely abnormal,” Carstens said during a panel on the future of financial services. “You cannot defy gravity. You are running an extremely risky operation. If something goes a little bit wrong, the possibility of crashing is very high.”  Read more: Why the Crypto Crash Will Accelerate Regulatory Action  ‘I welcome this downturn’  Several crypto heavyweights in attendance said the market crash was a welcome correction.  “I welcome this downturn,” Kris Marszalek, CEO of digital assets exchange Crypto.com, said during a panel on the future of crypto. “This is the time to demonstrate how the real [companies in crypto] can continue building [and] be the steady hand, the calming voice, during volatile times and just deliver real value.”  Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of fintech Ripple Labs, said that the downturn could weed out tokens that have no utility: “I think the vast majority of tokens will go away over a period of time, because I can't figure out the utility … Dogecoin is a clear example of [something that was] never designed with utility, the founders have left the project [and] it moves based upon the tweets of Elon Musk.”  During his panel, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, suggested that crypto entrepreneurs need to have a clear business model.  “If you're only getting users because you're using incentives to attract users, that's not a real business model. Eventually, you're going to run out of money and you will crash,"" Zhao said during a panel on Wednesday on weathering the storm and the next phase of growth.  The industry will take a long time to recover but “the worst part is probably over,” Zhao said.  Read more: Crypto Winter Is Here.

The problem is centralized finance, or CeFi, cosplaying as DeFi, they said, and there are no issues with DeFi proper. However, the idea that “this time will be different” and that financial actors would all act sensibly once DeFi “wins” is the deluded logic of the addict.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The reality is it will happen again because the political endgame in Ethereum, home of DeFi, remains ambiguous. Ethereum has a technical endgame – an open, transparent world computer – but nobody knows what Ethereum is for. The point, the rationale, why we are here. A big question mark.  Compare the situation to Bitcoin where the political endgame can be summarized in one word: hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin’s goal is to transition from a fiat monetary system to a Bitcoin standard.  See also: Ethereum's Political Philosophy Explained | Paul Dylan-Ennis  What is the equivalent one-word term in Ethereum? To find it, it is important to understand the contemporary Ethereum political landscape. The spectrum contains the following:  Cypherpunk: Ethereum is rooted in an earlier tradition of privacy and tech advocacy, which thought coders should use encryption and computing to build neutral infrastructure others can imbue with meaning. Ethereum’s politics is its apolitical stance, a position sometimes called algorithmic authority, and the only focus is to create open source tools that requires little human mediation. Associated with the Ethereum “core” developers.  Experimental liberalism: Ethereum’s combination of experimental governance (e.g., soulbound tokens) and market-making (e.g. Quadratic Voting) can generate new liberal democratic political innovations. This position is associated with the network’s founder Vitalik Buterin and Microsoft’s Glen Weyl.  Solarpunk: The social coordination enabled by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) can create positive externalities on wider society, with a warm ambient humanism embedded in its aesthetics. Gitcoin’s Kevin Owocki and Scott Moore and DoinGud’s Manu Alzuru are examples here.  Lunarpunk: The privacy enhancements afforded by zero-knowledge proof variations on Ethereum-native technologies (DAOs, DeFi, NFTs) are necessary to protect crypto culture against contemporary surveillance capitalism, typically taking an agorist, or left libertarian stance politically. This philosophical movement is associated with DarkFi’s Rachel-Rose O’Leary and Amir Taaki.  Degens: Ethereum is a platform for the construction of financial instruments with highly speculative characteristics and the only goal of its users is to accumulate wealth, possibly even in amoral ways. Essentially a form of market nihilism.  Is there some common thread running through these positions that would correspond to Bitcoin’s compact hyperbitcoinization?  Let’s exclude the market nihilists since their view is short term and with no real interest in what Ethereum is long term.  Across the spectrum, Ethereum’s goal is to transition from a deteriorating inherited financial system built on unsustainable practices. But also from the internal variations on these practices found in degen culture and their enablers, venture capital firms and hedge funds.  My contention is these diffuse points on the Ethereum political spectrum could be rolled into one overarching answer to the question, “What is Ethereum for, anyway?”  Without an answer to the question, suspicions invariably arise that the answer is: to pump ether, to generate yield, to flip NFTs, etc.  See also: Crypto: The Gift That Keeps On Giving (to Charity) | Opinion  This does not mean we need to collapse the diversity of views under one, cohesive meta position, but only that it would be helpful to have an answer that we could all roughly agree on, rough consensus and running code.  Seeking consensus across the spectrum, the political endgame of Ethereum can be summarized in one word: hyperregenization.  Regenerative economics rather than illusory limitless growth: Ethereum offers retroactive and proactive public goods funding through the Quadratic Funding (QF) mechanism. It contains the potential to expand the cypherpunk mechanism of neutral public goods beyond Ethereum and Web3, into the traditional political world, as the solarpunks suggests with their focus on positive externalities. Ethereum could then become a minarchist alternative to state provisioning built along liberal and humanist principles.  Regenerative citizenship rather than soulless individualistic speculation: Ethereum could reward good citizenship through retroactive airdrops, such as participation in Gitcoin rounds, governance voting, testnets and community channels. The activities of the citizens of experimental liberalism could be captured in soulbound tokens that grow over time, and we could ensure the privacy-oriented mindset of the lunarpunks enables citizens to “selectively reveal” themselves (or not reveal themselves at all). Secure social or community recovery methods will need to be established for this to flourish.  Regenerative decentralization rather than centralization atrophy: Ethereum is an information commons or common knowledge pool. Transparency allows us to recognize, albeit not without its challenges, when centralized clusters are emerging. Recent efforts to re-decentralize client diversity and current efforts to re-decentralize staking reveal the cultural instincts to disrupt centralization atrophy are intact. This will require a “night watchman” mentality on the part of the cypherpunk developer culture.  What is Ethereum for? To bring about ever more hyperregenization.

42393958,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwaA7,1656343487,Introducing Future of Work Week,"Since graduating from the University of Michigan in 2021, Chase Chapman hasn’t taken the traditional employment route. Instead of going into a corporate or nonprofit job, she’s been a member of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – including Index, Forefront, RabbitHole and Orca – and invested in several Web3 side projects.  To Chapman, traditional employment is dead. In the future, we won’t look to single companies to provide long-term jobs with predictability; we’ll work across multiple organizations, including DAOs, simultaneously. We’ll find professional and personal growth where we can, prizing autonomy and ownership.  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week  “We used to think that our jobs were these things that should give us fulfillment professionally and completely,” Chapman tells Jessica Klein in an interview for CoinDesk’s Future of Work Week. Now “you have a much more fluid way of thinking about what it means to do different types of work and engage across several different organizations.”  Chapman is part of a new breed of worker making a living from crypto networks formed around protocols and governed by DAOs. There are now more than 4,800 DAOs, according to DeepDAO.io. Collectively, they hold $8.3 billion in value (it was more a few weeks ago) and, lest it need to be said, they often make usable products and services.  Once derided as unworkable and liable to hacks (“The DAO Hack” lost about $60 million in 2016), DAOs are now seen by many as the future of work.  Read More: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto  The Harvard Business Review published a persuasive case in April (“How DAOs Could Change the Way We Work”) while the World Economic Forum said in June that DAOs could replace traditional businesses. Ben Schecter, the operations lead for RabbitHole, predicts that most of us won’t work for companies in the future. “People will earn income in nontraditional ways by taking actions such as playing games, learning new skills, creating art, or curating content,” he writes in an article for Andreessen Horowitz site Future. “The traditional way to make money was ‘work-to-earn,’ but the future of income is ‘x-to-earn’ – play to earn, learn to earn, create to learn…” (RabbitHole pays people to learn about new Web3 technologies.)  Schecter argues that DAOs are better than traditional companies at orchestrating projects with many insiders and outsiders (like contractors and freelancers). They provide better alignment between organizational goals and individual benefits and offer transparency and sense of purpose. “The openness of these crypto economies will allow people to participate in several DAOs and crypto networks, mixing and matching different income streams and ownership returns,” he said.  Of course, traditional 9-5 employment, which reached its zenith in the post-war era, has been under threat for years. Automation, outsourcing and offshoring reduced the number of employees companies needed, pushing out workers to contracting, freelancing and temp work. Then came gig work like Uber and the pandemic, which normalized working for oneself at home. About a third of the U.S. workforce, or 51 million people, is now in some kind of “nontraditional employment.” Last year, the number of nontraditional workers jumped 34% from 2020, according to data from MBO Partners.  And each version of the internet brings new ways of working. Web1 allowed us to work from anywhere. Web2 empowered entrepreneurs via social media (even if the returns often rebounded to the platforms). And now Web3 is creating ways for people who don’t know one another to collaborate on open-source projects and distribute the collective returns equitably.  Read more: Inside the Crypto Jobs Boom  DAOs still have to prove themselves as bedrocks of the new economy. But the pace at which they’ve been attracting talent, capital and innovation energy is encouraging. “Mainstream proliferation could happen sooner rather than later,” writes Steve Glaveski – the author of “Time Rich: Do Your Best Work, Live Your Best Life” – in the Harvard Business Review. “At its core, Web3 promises more fulfilling and outcomes-focused work, with a fairer distribution of ownership and rewards – and that is a future worth building.”  For our Future of Work Week, CoinDesk is rolling out a series of features and op-eds looking at the crypto jobs market and how ideas like DAOs will affect how we get stuff done.

42423042,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241bh,1656343072,"NFT, Private Wallet Fates Hang on EU Crypto Talks This Week","European Union (EU) negotiators meet this week for a last-ditch attempt to hammer out anti-money-laundering rules and a new authorization regime for crypto service providers.  Meetings on Wednesday and Thursday could determine the bloc’s crypto legal framework for years to come – but major questions still hang over the treatment of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), the energy impact of Bitcoin and the private use of unhosted wallets.  First will come talks on a controversial transfer-of-funds law, which would require wallet providers to identify the participants in crypto transactions. On June 29, EU officials gather to hammer out final details of those plans at a closed-door meeting.  On March 31, the European Parliament voted for wide-ranging privacy curbs, intended to stop digital assets from being used for drugs, child pornography and terrorism – something the industry warned could curb innovation.  Nonetheless, the round of talks set to be held Wednesday will be the last one, three sources involved in negotiations have told CoinDesk. That implies a belief that the remaining differences over the legislation can be settled between national governments who sit in the EU Council and lawmakers from the European Parliament; both groups must agree on a legal draft.  Read more: Crypto Privacy Positions Harden Ahead of Crunch EU Vote  Chief among the issues, and last to be agreed, is how to treat transfers made to and from “unhosted wallets” – private means of storing crypto assets that aren’t managed by a regulated service provider.  Proponents say the final text will still uphold the principle of verifying customer identity, but concede that it won’t always be possible. Remaining discussions could focus on such details as the exact monetary threshold that would trigger reporting and whether it needs to reveal the details of both participants to a transaction or just one.  Landmark  Talks on the related law known as the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA), continue the subsequent day, June 30.  MiCA is the EU’s landmark crypto assets law, making issuers register, prepare white papers of information for prospective investors and keep sufficient reserves for large-scale stablecoins. It’s been broadly welcomed by the industry because it would mean crypto firms can easily access the bloc’s large internal market of 450 million consumers.  The French government is hopeful the Thursday meeting could also be the last, it said in an internal paper seen by CoinDesk. It’s certainly the last chance for France to claim credit for finalizing the law – since, on July 1, it cedes the chair of the council to Czechia.  One key question is whether the scope should extend from coin offerings to cover non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which were left out of the original 2020 MiCA draft. Since then, the popularity of assets like Bored Apes has risen, and so have scams such as wash trades and pump and dump schemes in which traders manipulate prices to make a quick profit. That kind of abusive behavior, already outlawed on traditional finance markets, is now drawing regulators’ attention.  Read more: NFT Issuers Could Have to Centralize and Register Under EU's MiCA Rules, France Warns  Officials such as the European Commission’s Peter Kerstens have acknowledged that it would be “silly” to make NFT issuers publish a white paper for every single token – but suggested that those providing NFT wallets or brokerage are similar to service providers for bitcoin, hence should be brought under the legislation.  Broad Apes  Even without the white paper requirements, a broader law could mean NFT marketplaces like OpenSea would need to be authorized – something being pushed for in particular by lawmakers at the European Parliament.  The French paper suggests governments are still considering a general requirement for NFT service providers to register. There could be exemptions for artists who offer wallet services for their own creations, and for markets with low volume – which would mean excluding auction houses that only rarely trade NFTs, or gaming platforms for low-value items.  Even so, the prospect of including NFTs is causing consternation in the industry.  “I would call this a crisis,” said Florian Glatz, president of the German Blockchain Association, at a Twitter space Wednesday. “There is no good outcome.”  Marina Markezic, a colleague of Glatz’s at advocacy group the European Crypto Initiative (Euci), agrees NFT markets need extra rules to prevent insider trading. “Of course we agree that there have been pump and dumps, and bad things happen within the NFT space,” she said.  But, she added, merely copying and pasting financial-market rules designed for fungible assets into the innovative NFT space “is really wrong.”  One share in, say, Tesla is like any other, but each NFT is potentially unique, and the markets they’re traded on are possibly decentralized. So it’s not clear how you’d apply, for example, requirements for securities brokers to find the best deal for their clients, or curbs on offering financial advice. Counting NFTs as financial assets would also unfairly separate them from off-line equivalents like physical artworks, Euci members argue.  “We could consider a specific dedicated regulation” for some NFTs, Euci’s Simon Polrot said, but that would need to come after MiCA, and differentiate tokens linked to crypto banks from those representing physical objects. “It doesn’t make sense to put all these things in the same basket.”  Bitcoin ban?  A further MiCA issue concerns the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. Lawmakers previously proposed measures to curb carbon emissions, which the industry warned could amount to a bitcoin ban – while the European Central Bank’s Fabio Panetta has suggested an extra tax on energy-intensive mining methods such as proof-of-work (PoW).  The risk of such heavy-handed requirements seems to have receded, and the final text is likely to merely enhance transparency, two sources briefed on the talks have told CoinDesk.

42423028,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241Bh,1656342000,Azuro Raises $4M for ‘Decentralized Sportsbook Protocol’,"Azuro, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) building a protocol for blockchain-based betting, announced Monday it has raised a $4 million funding round.  Hypersphere, Gnosis, Merit Circle, Quiet Capital and Formless Capital were all participants in the round.  The ultimate goal of the project is to replace traditional bookmakers like sportsbooks, which are often perceived as predatory and profit motivated, to disrupt the $200 billion betting industry.  The protocol taps prediction markets, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), DAO governance and liquidity pools on its back end in a bid to minimize the associated costs of the betting process for users. The project lives in the Gnosis Chain and went live on its mainnet earlier in June.  “The problem is incentive misalignment,” Rossen Yordanov, a core contributor to the project, said in a press release. “Profits are zero-sum so many betting companies go to great lengths to create unfair and opaque environments for the players.”  The funding brings the project’s total fundraising to $7.5 million, with AllianceDAO, Arrington Capital, Ethereal Ventures and Delphi Digital having led its $3.5 million raise in January.  The blockchain-based betting industry has remained fledgling despite its promising foundation, with no clear front-runner having emerged. Legal implications, as always, continue to loom over the sector’s mainstream adoption, though insiders of the industry are optimistic about its future legality.  Read more: Wanna Bet?

Not a straight funding round, GEM's $200 million is described as a ""capital commitment,"" which is milestone-based and performance-related as a means of ensuring the funding is optimized fully, Unizen announced on Monday.  The funds will be used to improve Unizen's systems, grow its team, market its products and accelerate its in-house aggregation system, which is designed to find the most efficient trade routes across different centralized and decentralized crypto exchanges, such as Binance, Uniswap and PancakeSwap.

42394045,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bucjjz,1656341791,Chase Chapman on DAOs and Professional Polyamory,"“People always talk about DAOs enabling polyamorous work,” says Chase Chapman, a member of the core team and DAO of Orca Protocol, which offers a method DAOs can use to create and manage working units – appropriately termed “pods” – through on-chain governance.  Chapman’s work extends well beyond her pod, enabling her to practice professional polyamory with multiple organizations and skillsets. “That isn't taboo or problematic,” she explains. “It just means that you have a much more fluid way of thinking about what it means to do different types of work and engage across several different organizations.”  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week  Polyamorous work via DAOs is not an idea Chapman coined – she recalls seeing it in a tweet by @rafathebuilder. But it makes sense in the modern world, where more and more people are turning to non-monogamous relationships in their personal lives, acknowledging that it can take more than one person to meet another’s full set of needs. Why not take this attitude from the bedroom to the workplace?  “We used to think that our jobs were these things that should give us fulfillment professionally and completely,” Chapman says. “That’s very much the monogamy model.” For members of Gen Z like Chapman, that model’s grown outdated, particularly in the flexible world of online work and within the fluid organizational structure of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) in Web3.  Chapman’s embraced this polyamorous style of professionalism throughout her still nascent career in the blockchain industry. Having graduated from the University of Michigan in 2021, she got involved with multiple governance projects straight out the undergraduate gate, joining DAOs including Index, Forefront, and RabbitHole. While still in college, she co-founded a developer tooling company, Decentology, and currently hosts the podcast “On the Other Side.” She also does some advising work and occasionally invests in other Web3 companies.  “There's a lot of value in talent that doesn't want to be held down by one organization,” she says, describing some friends in Web3 who feel that committing to one company “limits what they can do in the space.” DAOs and the modern way of work let Chapman and her colleagues explore and “play around” in ways that wouldn’t be possible if they were tied to a traditional company.  Of course, all that job juggling can be stressful. When she was a member of four different DAOs post-college, it got to be a bit much. But the experience taught her some important lessons about how to communicate her capabilities – with herself and others. “When you have a lot of income streams like that, you have to be even more clear with yourself and with whoever you're working with about the exact things you're providing,” she says.  Read More: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto  These days, Chapman has narrowed her workload a bit, spending the bulk of her time on Orca. That doesn’t mean she’s gone monogamous. She still puts out regular podcast episodes, posts prolifically on Twitter, invests, and advises. Even within Orca Protocol, her roles are varied. Chapman is both a member of the core team of Sonar Labs, the centralized company behind Orca, and of Orca’s DAO. With the core team, she primarily focuses on communications, producing educational materials about the company’s main product, used mainly by other DAOs. She also “supports information flow” between Sonar Labs and the DAO.  “I would identify myself as more part of the core team than the DAO,” Chapman explains. She belongs to an entity called the “source pod” that’s made up of both core team and DAO members, through which she helps “steward” the DAO’s activities – like resource allocation planning for the third quarter of 2022.  Straddling a company and its surrounding community makes for a lot of meetings and modes of communication. Chapman uses Discord, Trello boards, and group calls to organize with both entities. The core team does three standup meetings per week, leaving two days for them to focus on content. She checks in with the DAO-centered community about once a day.  These online interactions are crucial for any decentralized company and, obviously, DAO. While the Orca team is largely U.S.-based, Chapman says, she’s not exactly sure where all the DAO members live – “a lot don’t share where they’re based.”  However, some are in New York City, where Chapman relocated to from Michigan in January to sit closer to the center of the U.S.’s crypto universe (she couldn’t quite see herself in Miami). She attends monthly dinners with the other DAO members who live near her, and has also attended some retreats for the DAO in other locations. “I think more DAOs should be doing retreats in general,” she says, stressing the importance of sharing physical space with colleagues who operate primarily in virtual arenas.  “I actually think office space is going to be relatively popular for DAO contributors,” Chapman adds, “especially because, when you think about what it means to have inner DAO connections and loose ties to a bunch of different people…office spaces happen to be a really good way to create those bonds.”  Some DAOs have already gone IRL. In New York, for example, Chapman points out how EmpireDAO rented “a bunch of offices where the Supreme building is…and I know a few other projects that are also thinking a lot about IRL.”  In the meantime, Chapman and her colleagues get to know each other through more creative means. “We’re doing this thing where once a week, two random people from our community are picked to just chat with each other,” she says. This helps the team get closer, even though some members remain anonymous. “If you create space for vulnerability, that often doesn't require knowing everything about where someone lives, if they're married, and all these things. Instead, people feel like they can share how they're feeling – if they're feeling stuck, or if something’s been bothering them lately. You can form pretty strong bonds.”  Read more: 'We're Freaking DAOing It': The People Who Think DAOs Are the Future of Work  Though Chapman’s committed to DAOs and what they can accomplish, she sees some flaws with their operations. “We often hold ‘decentralization’ as this gold standard. I think the problem is that when we think about decentralization, what comes to mind are protocols like Bitcoin or Ethereum,” she says. “The way decentralization looks at a protocol level, it's probably not feasible for human beings.” For Chapman, a human approach to decentralization means honoring people’s specialties – not creating a flat structure where everyone’s work and ideas are weighted equally, but delegating appropriately based on skillsets.  After all, Chapman’s driving question in Web3 has always been, “How do we make this stuff human?” For DAOs, one of those ways would be to rethink governance tokens as compensation for DAO members, which she believes fosters inequity. “Either people have to dump them in order to earn income,” she says, or those who have enough money to hold onto their governance tokens end up with all the decision-making power. Fiat wealth still translates to power, and that’s a problem in an ecosystem meant to move beyond fiat.  To right this imbalance, Chapman thinks many DAOs will embrace compensation via stablecoins going forward. She also foresees the types of working groups that have come up in DAOs becoming floating entities, forming small squads (or, you know, pods) that function well as a team and can move from one DAO to another to flexibly provide support as they desire.  Ultimately, Chapman plans to stick with DAO work to help keep Web3 human. “There is a level of humility among people that work in DAOs who are building that type of culture correctly, which is that anyone can come up with a great idea and anyone can execute on it,” she says. “I really, really value that and probably wouldn't want to go back.”  More from CoinDesk’s Future of Work Week  The Crypto Jobs Boom  It may be a bear market, but there are still plenty of jobs to be had at crypto companies.

I’m Lyllah Ledesma, here to take you through the latest in crypto markets, news and insights.  Price point: Bitcoin is trading slightly down on the day, but is holding $21,000.  Market Moves: Data from CoinShares shows a record high of bitcoin net outflows last week.  Price point  Bitcoin (BTC) is slightly down on the day after a steady weekend of trading in a range of $20,000 to $21,800. This comes as the cryptocurrency has struggled to stabilize over the last few weeks, dropping to a low of $18,001 on June 18.  Bitcoin, is up 3.8% over the last seven days, but is down about 27% over the last month.  “BTC is showing some decent support, but it’s a bit too early to get excited for any continued upside,” said Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack Funds.  Dibb expects the price will continue to follow macro trends, which have seen a nice bounce over the last week. “Any additional news around contagion and lender insolvency will likely lead to a swift sell-off,” he said.  In recent weeks, digital asset markets have been weighed down by reports of financial difficulties at crypto lenders, including Celsius Network, BlockFi and Voyager Digital, and at hedge fund Three Arrows Capital.  If additional crypto lenders ""come out with unhealthy balance sheets, we may see further liquidation of assets across the board,” Dibb said.  “It’s hard to tell right now which lenders and exchanges are safe.” Dibb added. BlockFi announced last week that it has secured a $250 million revolving credit facility from crypto exchange FTX.     Market moves  Digital asset investment products saw a record of $423 million in net outflows last week, which is the largest of all time, according to data from CoinShares.  The outflows were solely focused on bitcoin, which saw net outflows for the week of $453 million. That erased almost all inflows year to date and left total bitcoin assets under management at $24.5 billion, the lowest point since the beginning of 2021.  Short bitcoin funds – set up to bet on price declines – saw net inflows of $15 million. CoinShares cited the launch of the first U.S.-based short exchange-traded fund last week.  Ethereum saw net inflows of $11 million, ending a streak of 11 consecutive weeks of net outflows.  According to this week's report, outflows were consistent with CoinDesk's reporting last week  Latest headlines  Morgan Stanley: GPU Demand Likely to Slow if Ethereum Moves to Proof-of-Stake Moving to PoS will also not solve Ethereum’s scaling problems, the report said.

Our May forecast for the price fall to the range of $0.00000720 has fully worked. After consuming the two previous weekly candles in just one week, buyers showed readiness for a global reversal in the SHIB market. Interestingly, the local fall of BTC price no longer affects altcoins as catastrophically as during May and early June. This suggests that the bulk of investors have been pushed out of the market and it is time to start a new trend - a growth trend. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/r4YoVTpq/ However, in our opinion, you can confidently buy SHIB in two cases. The first signal to buy is a break of the liquidity range $0.0000113-$0.000013 up. In this range, buyers managed to slow down the fall of SHIB for 4 weeks. Breaking up and fixing above this range will open the way for buyers to the target of $0.0000215. So far, this is the final target that buyers can achieve without deep correction and testing for strength. In the event that buyers fail to control the range of $0.0000113-$0.000013 by the current local attack, we will expect the SHIB price near $0.00000850. At this point, there will be a good chance to enter the market of investors who &apos;slept&apos; an aggressive price rebound.

The downgrade was due to the continued fall in crypto prices and the ensuing fall in industry activity levels, Goldman said. Coinbase shares dropped 5.7% to $59.40 in pre-market trading.  In the same report, the Wall Street giant upgraded Robinhood Markets (HOOD) to “neutral” from “sell” with a $9.50 price target. Robinhood shares rose 2.6% to $8.21 in pre-market trading.  Current digital asset levels and trading volumes imply “further degradation” in Coinbase’s revenue base, which Goldman sees falling around 61% year-on-year in 2022, and about 73% in the back half of the year.  While Coinbase, which is helmed by CEO Brian Armstrong, recently announced a notable restructuring, which involved laying off 18% of its workforce, the bank says further cuts are needed.  Coinbase will need to make substantial reductions to its cost base to “stem the resulting cash burn” as retail trading activity slows down, the note said, adding that the company faces a difficult choice between shareholder dilution and significant reductions in “effective employee compensation,” which may have a negative impact on talent retention.  Goldman is more bearish on the competitive environment and the outlook for fee rate compression given the announced merging of Coinbase and Coinbase Pro platforms, which has the potential to reduce the switching costs and make lower pricing more available to users.  With Coinbase trading with a market cap of around $11.5 billion relative to its almost $3.8 billion net cash position as of the first quarter 2022, the bank sees limited valuation support as higher revenues in the short term would require higher cryptocurrency prices and volatility, and it forecasts breakeven to negative adjusted EBITDA over the next several years.

Even though the city was shut down, I spent the day trying to ensure everyone got paid. That meant typing up wire letters, printing them out, walking to the CFOs office for signatures, faxing them to the bank and then waiting for the bank to call and confirm the amounts.  Even back then, the system was obviously broken – a company should be able to pay its people without requiring its accounting staff to go to such extremes.  Megan Knab is the co-founder and CEO of Franklin, a new crypto-native payroll company. This article is part of ""Future of Work Week.""  In the 10 years since, so much of our daily workplace technology has transformed, and yet the most basic pieces of payments infrastructure have not kept pace. Cloud computing has largely beat on-premises software. Zoom is now an essential tool for most businesses and workers. The Great Resignation means workers are empowered to dictate their daily habits, including remote work and time off.  The U.S. payroll industry is a $62 billion behemoth, according to IBISWorld, and fit to be disrupted by the emergent and powerful tools enabled by blockchain.  Payroll today is built on top of traditional banking rails, meaning it is rife with inefficiencies, barriers to entry and high cost. An entire ecosystem of payday lenders, overdraft fees and expensive check cashiers has emerged to “support” the payroll industry. These intermediaries cost Americans upwards of $15 billion annually.  See also: It Can't Be 'Decentralization or Bust' | Opinion  Unlike other areas of fintech, payroll innovation has been largely limited to risk shifting. Some payroll companies simply float cash to their corporate customers, facilitating the feeling of “instant” payroll while actually not addressing any of the underlying inefficiencies. While there has been experimentation with prepaid debit cards, mobile payments and digital wallets, there are additional ways companies ought to employ to ease the accessibility of workers’ paychecks.  One of the core building blocks of the future of work must be a digitally native, significantly cheaper payroll infrastructure. It should allow for the meshing of digitally native payment features and legacy medical benefits, retirement accounts and tax requirements.  The new payments stack of Web3 offers the ability to instantly settle transactions – potentially cutting lending costs down almost to zero. A crypto-native stack also has crypto-native innovations:  Streaming payments so that workers are accruing their earnings in real time.  Faster, cheaper cross-border payments.  Ease of integration with investment and benefits products.  This oft-overlooked part of fintech, payroll, is one of the fundamental building blocks for the health and wealth of society. In the United States and Canada, we have payroll-based insurance models meaning that healthcare for many is dependent upon employment. Payroll infrastructure and data was an integral part of facilitating COVID stimulus payments.  See also: Not Everyone Can Afford to Be Satoshi | Opinion  It is the mechanism by which our government collects tax revenue, a part of how our justice system levies fines and one of the key motivating factors in workforces. Economists and analysts look to firms like ADP for early data on payroll trends in advance of jobs reports to gauge economic health.  The Web3 industry has been innovating for years on payments and other kinds of wealth creation products. All of that creativity and talent could be lost if the most basic and fundamental business operating activities are not reformed.  While the accounting office of today may not always be as bad as sending faxes during a natural disaster, technological innovation has been tepid.

42421525,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoYP7,1656333624,You’re Hiring Wrong: Do It More Like Web3,"PSA to traditional hiring managers: You’re doing it wrong.  Over the last two years, a movement has emerged in Web3 that is turning the status quo talent acquisition process on its head – and creating a more constructive method for attracting and retaining talent.  Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have paved the way for this paradigm shift, offering an inverse approach to the current process that many professionals have experienced on their journey to employment.  Avi Meyers is the director of governance and partnerships at Flipside Crypto, a blockchain analytics firm. This article is part of CoinDesk’s Future of Work Week.  Most businesses hire by inclusion via exclusion. They interview a bunch of candidates in a formal setting, exclude most of them and include the winners.  DAOs actualize the opposite: exclusion via inclusion – create an open environment, incentivize behaviors, reward top contributors.  While simultaneously building teams for Flipside Crypto and MetricsDAO, I became aware of the stark differences between these two methods – but also the merits of each.  See also: Pussy Riot, Political Action and the Future of DAOs | Opinion  And by reflecting on my own experiences, I’ve been able to identify a few easy steps that hiring managers can take to blend the best of both worlds. To explain, let’s first travel back to 2009.  Traditional Hiring: Inclusion via exclusion  Like many college graduates looking for employment during the Great Recession, I began frequenting job fairs in the Boston area. On one fateful evening, I wandered into a dreary downtown hotel for a financial technology job fair.  Going in I had zero expectations, and maybe that’s why two weeks and 10 grueling interviews later, I got my first job offer.  My skill set definitely did not fit the role. The interview process was generic and the firm’s approach to hiring was narrowed to a few select schools with candidates of a certain pedigree. This meant the company was forcing a target persona onto candidates who were then forced to fit the mold. The recruiters weren’t much interested in exploring an individual’s diverse talents.  Unfortunately, my experience in the hiring process is quite common and causes a lot of young hopefuls to land jobs where they don’t belong. It’s not the people who are the problem, it’s the foundational process:  Inclusion via exclusion.  That is the way traditional companies find talent: exclude most, include the winners.  They evaluate on a finite set of criteria, assess abilities through a formal and confining process, and develop a set of assumptions about the candidate based on collective feedback from the hiring team.  Sure, it works, but could it be better? Of course it can.  Web3 Hiring: Exclusion via inclusion  So what does better look like? First, some perspective.  In 2018, I made the leap full time into what is now called Web3, joining Flipside Crypto. Our business model took off at the intersection of data analytics and Web3 community growth, and after fostering a community of over 12,000 data analysts, we began contributing to and incubating DAOs as part of our core objectives.  MetricsDAO was the first one we bootstrapped. Incubating it meant rolling up our sleeves, building teams (referred to as pods), and growing a brand new type of organization from zero to one. The amazing thing about DAOs is how porous and fluid they are. Contributors come and go as they please, following their passions and delivering meaningful work to the organization when they feel like it.  Read More: What Is Web 3 and Why Is Everyone Talking About It?  As DAOs scale, the team must produce incentives to keep core contributors involved. These incentives come in the form of compensation (monetary or otherwise), privileges (like gated access) and leadership opportunities. In other words, through a free-flowing, inclusive model, talent is identified and rises to the top.  In this sense, DAOs are creating a talent pipeline and selection process opposite that of traditional businesses. It is more open, exploratory, creative, and natural. It is:  Exclusion via inclusion.  And yet, DAOs are beginning to integrate certain aspects of the traditional hiring process. For example, infrastructure providers, such as Wonderverse, Drepute and GitPOAP, are competing to build tools that could be used as Web3 “resumes,” where DAO contributors can track their contributions and experiences. Unlike traditional resumes, which require the hiring manager to trust what’s written on the paper (or verify it themselves), the new versions will display non-fungible or proof-of-attendance protocol tokens (NFTs or POAPs) attesting to past work and verifiable on-chain. This model also consolidates inherently diffuse DAO work into a single attributable form, making it easier for DAO leaders to assess a contributor's relevant experience. New builders emerge in this field daily.  See also: DAOs and the Coming InDAOstrial Revolution | Opinion  On the other hand, traditional businesses have yet to adopt any strategies of the DAO talent acquisition funnel in a meaningful way – much to their own detriment. By integrating a more open, fluid model, traditional companies would find it easier to attract the right talent for open roles by allowing candidates to explore more freely, and ultimately end up with a more passionate and engaged workforce.  With that in mind, here are three easy steps that hiring managers can follow today to become more like Web3:  Shift your mindset: Instead of a gated community, think of your entry-level talent pool as a community garden where anyone can come and contribute.  Build it, and they will come: Implement programs (of course they should have adequate guardrails) that create a safe space for this type of open talent acquisition to flourish.  Stay vigilant: Many of these practices are experimental and will require constant iteration. Stay on it, the juice is worth the squeeze.  In the end, if you’re going to have to exclude people, at least do it by including them first.

42393961,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brwaUd,1656333520,The Crypto Jobs Boom,"Cryptocurrency prices are crashing. The markets are bleeding. Firms are laying off workers. Crypto exchange Coinbase even rescinded accepted job offers, blindsiding would-be employees. But the crypto job market is … still going strong?  Kind of.  Even three weeks ago, before the price of bitcoin tumbled below $30,000, Michael Shlayen, founder of BlockchainHeadhunter, said that “overall, there is a slowdown.” He found that “some companies are putting a freeze on hiring.” Then bitcoin crashed below $20,000. On June 23, Shlayen updated his assessment, saying that “hiring slowed down even further and the job market has continued to cool off.”  This interview is part of CoinDesk's Future of Work Week.  But that doesn’t mean it’s all doom and gloom. Even after the price crash, Shlayen said that “there are still some companies with healthy treasuries and lengthy runways who are continuing to hire ambitiously.”  Other crypto recruiters and headhunters are seeing the same thing – or are even more optimistic. Three weeks ago, Daniel Adler, founder of Cryptocurrency Jobs, acknowledged that he was seeing a bit of a slowdown, but even after bitcoin plunged below $18,000, he updated his take to say that not much has changed, noting that “if anything, it seems things are stabilizing.”  “Teams have had time to adjust to market conditions and the macro environment, and so are able to make more informed decisions,” he said June 21. He predicted that the Cryptocurrency Jobs will have more listings at the end of the month than it did at the beginning. (Are you reading this, Polymarket users?)  Emily Landon, another crypto recruiter, said she found that “a lot of our projects have put things on hold until they can see what’s going on in the bear market.” But even after the slump in prices, Landon said that “we are getting great new business,” meaning new clients and new job openings.  Adler said that while he’s seeing a slowdown, that could also be the result of macro forces outside the blockchain industry.  Read More: What You Need to Know and Do to Get a Job in Crypto  “Crypto is not immune from what’s happening in the world,” Adler said, citing the war in Ukraine, rising inflation and concerns about a global recession. “That’s affecting crypto as well.” He said that some companies have instituted hiring freezes. Plenty are “still building, and it’s business as usual.”  What counts as “business as usual?” To put the recent cooldown in perspective, it helps to look more broadly at the last 18 months of the crypto job market.  The call of the wild  “The last year and a half has been completely crazy,” said Shlayen, who said he placed more candidates in the past 18 months than in the prior four years combined. For much of that time, he witnessed “a shift of professionals moving into the crypto space.”  Just a few of the high-profile jumps from the “old world” into crypto: Sherice Torres, the former chief marketing officer of Meta Platforms, Facebook’s parent company, is now the CMO of payments company Circle. Brian Roberts hopped from Lyft, where he was the chief financial officer, to NFT (non-fungible token) marketplace OpenSea, where he holds the same position. Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital fund heavily investing in crypto, scooped up a glittering roster of all-star talent, including Bill Hinman (former director at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), Brent McIntosh (former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs) and Tomicah Tillemann (a policy wonk who used to be an adviser to President Biden) – not exactly crypto bros.  Read More: How to Get a Job in Crypto  While it’s tough to quantify the precise size of the shift, a study from LinkedIn found that “crypto-related job postings skyrocketed last year” and “grew 395% in the U.S. from 2020 to 2021, outpacing the wider tech industry, which saw a 98% increase.”  Lawyers became crypto lawyers. Marketers became crypto marketers. And, um, writers have become crypto writers.  “It’s hiring across all roles, and it’s not just engineering.” Adler said, adding that it was the “strongest market I’ve ever seen.” He said that because so many crypto companies are well-funded and looking to expand, they had roles for “marketing, operations, legal, finance, treasury, content – you name it.”  So why are droves of workers making the jump to crypto? The first reason is obvious. Jenna Pilgrim, principal at Mayflower Strategic, another crypto headhunting firm, said that starting salaries are “pretty comparable” to jobs at Silicon Valley and “much higher” than jobs in financial services, with executives getting paid in the range of $250,000 to $400,000.  And that’s just the base salary. Crypto jobs often come with a trove of tokens, said Shlayen, and those can be lucrative. “If the project succeeds, [total compensation] can be much higher than the actual salary. I’ve seen some crazy packages.” For example, Shlayen said that some of the jobs he has booked for clients – and not even at the executive level – have included $10,000 worth of tokens, and then those tokens “100Xed.” So that twentysomething engineer became a millionaire. At least, until a few weeks ago.  But money is only part of the lure.  “When you look at the space, crypto is more optimistic and mission-driven,” Adler said. He has found that crypto job-seekers truly care about the community and the memes and the GMs and the WAGMIs.  Whether these good vibes survive the price meltdown, of course, remains an open question, although Landon said that as recently as June 22, some companies are “still growing and building.” Others are drawn to the transparency of Web3, with a wealth of data auditable by anyone on public ledgers.  By contrast, when you work at traditional Web2 companies, it can be frustrating to be kept in the dark on the actual metrics of a site’s performance. Are we really hitting our goals? Is senior leadership telling us the truth? “But in a Web3 space,” Adler said. “You can look at a dashboard to see how many users are using the protocol.”  Then there’s the fact that crypto jobs – even if the money is the same – just strike many as more interesting than traditional roles.  “You can’t disregard the intellectual curiosity,” Adler said. Many of the job seekers, he said, are genuinely drawn to the sector’s wide-ranging mix of economics, psychology, law, geopolitics, philosophy and the overall question of “how do you build systems that actually work?” In other words, they are drawn to the same things that get people to read (or write) about crypto.  All ages and walks of life are seeking crypto jobs  For the bulk of this hiring frenzy, it has not just been the twentysomething crypto bros who are riveted by these questions.  “It’s a mix of all ages,” Landon said. At the job market’s peak, she was gaining 1,000 new LinkedIn followers each week and 50 new connection requests per day. A 72-year-old woman reached out to Landon for a crypto admin position, telling her that, “My son says it’s the future, and I believe him.”  At the other end of the spectrum, Landon works with 16-year-olds still in high school, and said that ‘they’re accepting job offers instead of going to college.”  And in many cases, no crypto experience is required. “A growing number of professionals are coming from other industries and looking to get into the Web3 world,” Shlayen said.  Adler’s inbox is often packed with direct messages from candidates with traditional jobs who are “crypto curious” and now want to work on it full time. He said this ranges from the chief of staff at a large bank to medical practitioners to blue-collar construction workers, and that is a point “I want to hammer home – it’s everyone,” he said.  Read More: Coinbase Lays Off Around 1,100 Employees  As for the recent crash in prices, and the looming fears of a crypto winter? Adler has been connecting crypto candidates with crypto companies since 2017, and he said that even now – after the Celsius Network meltdown, with the drop in prices – it doesn’t feel like the crypto winter of 2018 and 2019.  Adler said that from what he sees from a qualitative perspective, “Teams are building, talent still wants to make the transition into crypto, and there's plenty of funding,” he said.  Maybe the industry has matured. Maybe there’s just more funding. Maybe company and project treasuries have wisely diversified their assets into fiat, cushioning the crash and giving them more runway.  Maybe. Or maybe we’ll all soon be flipping burgers at McDonald’s.

Sellers did not respond to the aggressive weekly candle of buyers from 13 January and were satisfied with stopping the price near the important level of $11.27.

It is due to the retention of this mark (although there were false breakdowns) that buyers were able to organize the final growth impulse to the mark of $59.27. Source: https://www.tradingview.com/x/FiHQxAxA/ However, the HNT price was expected to rebound from $11.27 to at least $7.5. Such a local fall wave would test the strength of buyers and show the actual number of active sellers who believe in the continuation of the fall. While the HNT price is below $11.27, the correction scenario is relevant. To do this, sellers need another week or two to keep the mark, not allowing it to be fixed higher on the weekly timeframe.

42423033,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy241Jh,1656330040,"Crypto Hedge Funds, Traders Short Tether After UST’s Implosion: Report","Crypto-focused hedge funds are increasingly shorting U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin tether (USDT) amid a bleak market outlook nearly a month after the implosion of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin, the Wall Street Journal said in a report on Monday.  “There has been a real spike in the interest from traditional hedge funds who are taking a look at tether and looking to short it,” Leon Marshall, head of institutional sales at Genesis Global Trading, said in a statement. Marshall added the positions were worth at least “hundreds of millions” of dollars.  Genesis and CoinDesk are independent subsidiaries of Digital Currency Group.  Genesis said short positions increased after the multibillion-dollar implosion of UST. Prices of the algorithmically controlled stablecoin plunged to a few pennies in late May, causing contagion risks that affected prominent crypto lenders and trading funds.  Some funds are shorting USDT as a bet against the broader economy as the U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates to curb 40-year-high inflation. Others are concerned about the quality of the assets backing tether, according to the Journal's report.  Stablecoins like tether are backed by fiat currencies and equivalent asset investments such as commercial paper, bank deposits, bonds, gold and cryptocurrencies, according to issuer Tether Global.  The stablecoin market has taken a hit since UST’s implosion in May with investors redeeming huge amounts of USDT. In mid-June, investors pulled $1.7 billion from tether in one week, as reported.  Tether’s market capitalization has fallen by over $20 billion since mid-May, CoinGecko data shows.  Funds like Fir Tree Partners and Viceroy Research have previously bet against tether, citing the opacity about the asset’s actual backing and the lack of audited reserves.  Tether officials, however, have denied such risks exist. In June, Tether said rumors of its portfolio being “85% backed by Chinese or Asian commercial paper” were “completely false” and likely perpetrated by those looking to generate “additional profits from an already stressed market.  In April, a Tether spokesperson told MarketWatch that short sellers seem to be involved in a “clever scheme to raise capital from those less knowledgeable, by leveraging on disinformation with the end goal of collecting a management fee.”",NEGATIVE,USDT,BUSINESS | FIAT | LUNA | MARKET | USDT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/06/27/crypto-hedge-funds-traders-short-tether-after-usts-implosion-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b851f57ab0630433d13b4b9966bcbf278e2b8733-3791x2843.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42423025,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOy2415h,1656327856,Morgan Stanley: GPU Demand Likely to Slow if Ethereum Moves to Proof-of-Stake,"If Ethereum moves to a proof-of-stake (PoS) method of maintaining its network, as planned, it will remove the need for miners, slow demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and dramatically reduce energy requirements, Morgan Stanley said in a report Monday.  Ethereum developers are hoping that the Merge will happen by September and potentially as early as August, but given previous delays, it wouldn't be surprising if the move from proof-of-work were pushed out to early next year, the report said.  Crypto mining has had a massive impact on the gaming graphics market in the past 18 months, the bank said, driving an estimated 14% of revenue in 2021, while at the same time “substantially contributing to a major graphic shortage, which boosted overall mix and pricing.”  GPU demand should slow, but chip maker Nvidia is less exposed to cryptocurrency mining demand than it was in 2017-19, the note said.  In addition, demand from crypto mining, which contributed to a shortage of graphics cards, started winding down in the first half of the year, the bank noted.  Both Nvidia and AMD, another chip maker, have argued that they have minimized the downside scenarios from crypto, but Morgan Stanley foresees a correction lower in gaming GPU in the first quarter of next year, because in part of lower demand due to a reduction in working from home, cryptocurrency migration to PoS and “tough sequential comps after channel inventory rebuild in 2022.""  Ethereum miners will most likely sell their used GPU equipment after the Merge because it's not profitable for all of those computers to mine other cryptocurrencies, the bank said, adding that net ether (ETH) supply is expected to fall after the Merge, and may even turn contractionary, and so it is unlikely that all the miners become stakers.

In the blockchain world, the gas fee is a fee that users have to pay to the blockchain network for each transaction. For example, when a user makes a transfer on Ethereum, miners must package his transaction and put it on the blockchain to complete the transaction. This process consumes the computing resources of the blockchain, and the fee paid to miners is called the gas fee.

Today, we will illustrate the significance of the gas economy from the perspectives of performance and value capture. Performance - The frequent network congestion of Solana In early May, Solana&apos;s mainnet lost consensus, and block generation was suspended for 7 hours. The mainnet was down due to the NFT minting of a new NFT project. Users turned to bots for sending transactions as much as possible to increase their success rate of minting. This led to 6 million transactions per second on the Solana mainnet, which jammed the network. Moreover, as Solana transmits consensus messages as a special transaction message between validators, the heavily congested network also disabled the normal transmission of consensus messages, eventually leading to the loss of consensus.

With the rise of bitcoin use, El Salvador became the first country to legalize bitcoin as a legal tender. El Salvador&apos;s choice created a domino effect with many other countries considering the move. However, in order to do so, it is vital that the administrations understand the economic impact of legalizing Bitcoin. Thus, we should explore the economic results of identifying bitcoin as a legal tender in a country. Promote Financial Independence Bitcoin legalization is an effective way of providing an alternative currency for use in a given country. As with most countries contemplating the move, a potential economic impact of legalizing Bitcoin would be the direct solution to the use of weak or foreign currencies. Bitcoin, being decentralized in nature, is beyond the control of the country in question. Thus, while using such currencies, countries are limited with regard to monetary policy and decision-making. As evident in the case of El Salvador, the country&apos;s reliance on the US dollar created limited financial control for the country&apos;s financial sector. However, with the use of bitcoin, the country became better positioned to determine its financial position and adjust it accordingly. This change has enabled the country to create and enforce policies that wil...",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptoknowmics,https://www.cryptoknowmics.com/news/economic-impact-of-legalizing-bitcoin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=economic-impact-of-legalizing-bitcoin,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptoknowmics.png

However, not all cryptocurrencies are created equal. That&apos;s because different cryptocurrencies have different strengths and weaknesses. As a volatile asset, cryptos have been associated with increased risk to users. One of the most important factors that determine a cryptocurrency&apos;s price is its supply and demand.

The networks&apos; hash rate is subject to fluctuations that stabilize and have minimal effects in the long term.
