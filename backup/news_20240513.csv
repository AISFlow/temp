27756168,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607713,1715641217,Gaming The System: Pundit Reveals Why XRP Price Will Reach $33,"A crypto analyst has predicted a substantial bullish surge for the the XRP price in the future. According to the analyst, XRP is gearing up for a substantial increase to $33.5 from an initial price of $0.50. He expects the price of the cryptocurrency to explode by 6600% in this current market cycle. Analyst Forecasts Exponential Rise In XRP Price In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst identified as ‘Egrag Crypto,’ revealed a series of bullish price targets for XRP in the near future. The analyst focused his predictions on a technical analysis called “the Line of Hestia.” Related Reading: US Mega Banks JP Morgan And Wells Fargo Unveil Bitcoin Exposure As BTC Drops To $60,000 Egrag Crypto’s latest findings suggest that XRP could rise to $33.5 if it touches the Line of Hestia, a technical indicator featuring an ascending trend line which signals a potential upsurge for the price of a cryptocurrency. According to the analyst, “Historical data indicates that every time the XRP price touches the “Line of Hestia,” it experiences significant price pumps.” This implies that there may be a correlation between XRP’s bullish price movements and the ascending trend line. Egrag Crypto also revealed that following this historical pattern, XRP has witnessed pumps ranging from 6600%,1444%, 100%, 80%, and 171%. Given the established trend, Egrag Crypto predicts XRP’s ascent to new all-time highs. He calculated the average percentage increase of XRP’s price each time it touched the Line of Hestia, dividing the sum by the total number of occurrences, which is five. Using this data, the crypto analyst estimates that if XRP were to experience a 6600% increase, its future price would be $33.50. Similarly, he calculated new prices for XRP based on the previous percentages. It’s important to note that the price of XRP, at the time of writing, is trading at $0.5. The cryptocurrency has been recording considerable declines over the past year, consolidating around the $0.5 price mark for months. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP has also recorded a 7.35% decrease over the past seven days and a 0.08% decline in the last 24 hours. Although Egrag Crypto has remained optimistic about XRP’s future price, other crypto community members have expressed skepticism over the analyst’s ambitious forecast. A few community members have denied the prediction, emphasizing that the cryptocurrency’s surge to $33.5 during this cycle was highly unlikely. Possible Price Correction Ahead Of Projected Surge In one of his most recent X posts, Egrag Crypto disclosed that XRP could witness a major price correction before experiencing a significant rally. The analyst has urged crypto investors to remain cautious of the cryptocurrency unless the XRP/BTC ratio closes above the $0.00010 threshold. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Buy The Dip Sentiment Erodes Amid Drop Toward $60,000 Egrag Crypto anticipates a potential 45% decline for XRP/BTC, emphasizing that this substantial price drop could indicate a bottom between $0.0000055 and $0.0000077. However, he also disclosed that overcoming resistance at $0.00001 would be crucial for a rebound in XRP.

27754963,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607850,1715639409,"Aptos Posts Triple-Digit Gains In Key Metrics, Yet APT Price Struggles At $8.40","According to a report by Messari, Layer 1 (L1) blockchain Aptos experienced substantial gains in key metrics during the first quarter (Q1) of the year. The growth was driven by the surge in Bitcoin prices to new record highs and increased capital inflow in the market. However, Aptos’ native token, APT, has struggled with price performance, recording modest gains compared to other top cryptocurrencies. Aptos Network Activity Surges The report highlighted that Aptos’ circulating market cap increased 127% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) to $6.6 billion. This growth outpaced other projects with similar market caps, improving market cap rank from 33 to 22. Despite this growth, APT’s price experienced a more modest increase of 76% QoQ. Aptos revenue, which encompasses all fees collected by the protocol, grew by 37% to $475,000. However, when denominated in APT, the revenue decreased by 10%. All revenue generated by Aptos is burned, but these burned tokens have not significantly reduced inflation. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Run Over? Analyst Anticipates Further Upside APT inflation started at a 7% annualized rate and is set to decrease by 1.5% each year until it reaches 3.5%. By mid-October, the inflation rate had reduced to just under 6.9%. Additionally, there was inflationary pressure from the genesis supply unlocks, with almost 31% of the genesis supply distributed by the end of Q1. Looking at network activity, Aptos witnessed a significant increase in transactions and active addresses in Q1. Average daily transactions and addresses saw 66% and 97% QoQ growth rates, respectively. Despite the increased transaction activity, the average transaction fee decreased by 45% QoQ to 0.0006 APT ($0.007). Furthermore, average daily new addresses grew by 91% QoQ to 44,000, and the weighted average one-month retention rate increased by 82% QoQ to 14%. APT Staked Tokens Decrease 5% Regarding staking, APT staked decreased by 5% to 861 million tokens. However, when denominated in USD, the staked market cap grew by 68% QoQ, surpassing $14 billion. As seen in the chart above, Aptos also experienced growth in its decentralized finance (DeFi) total value locked (TVL), which increased by 376% QoQ to $573 million. According to Messari, this increase was not solely due to APT price appreciation; TVL also grew by 170% QoQ in APT terms. Additionally, Aptos’s stablecoin market cap nearly doubled QoQ, reaching $97 million. APT Struggles To Break $8.80 Resistance Despite these positive developments, APT’s price performance has faced challenges. The native token has declined over 16% in the past month, resulting in a modest 2.7% surge year-to-date. This contrasts with the double or triple-digit gains seen by other top cryptocurrencies. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Injective (INJ) Breakout: $50 Price Range On The Horizon Currently trading at $8.46, APT has struggled to surpass its nearest resistance wall at $8.80, leading to a consolidation phase between $8.20 and $8.70 over the past month.

Juliano will transition to the roles of Chairman and President, with Ivo Crnkovic-Rubsamen set to take over as CEO. Related Reading: dYdX Founder Skeptical Of Current Bull Run, Cites Low Participation Juliano Reflects On His Tenure And The Evolution Of dYdX Juliano’s tenure as CEO saw dYdX grow into a prominent player in the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, especially in derivatives trading. Reflecting on his journey since the dYdX whitepaper in 2017, Juliano shared in the announcement that moments of “overwhelming” pressure made him consider stepping aside. Juliano noted: For my own part in this journey, I too have come far. I feel as though I’ve been gifted (and endured) a lifetime’s worth of adventure and growth since solo founding dYdX at 24. Chris Dixon once told me “founding is an emotional challenge disguised as an intellectual one”. I have now lived this, and know it to be true. dYdX has given me the rollercoaster of intense experiences from ibar, to excitement, to elation, to desolation. There have been times, many of them, when l’ve felt so overwhelmed I wanted to leave. Notably, Juliano’s decision to change roles, as highlighted in the announcement, comes from a place of “personal satisfaction” and the “realization” that while he is irreplaceable as the founder, the role of CEO can be handed over to someone else.

Juliano expressed confidence in Crnkovic-Rubsamen’s ability to lead, noting that he has been “progressively” stepping back over the past two years, preparing for this transition. Juliano will continue influencing “major decisions” and strategy at dYdX, working closely with the new CEO to oversee day-to-day operations. He emphasized that dYdX’s mission is far from complete, pointing to the growing importance of DeFi and derivatives in the crypto landscape, noting: dYdX is not finished. Not even close. The opportunity is bigger than ever now. It’s becoming incredibly obvious that DeFi will be the dominant way crypto is used, and derivatives will pily a large part in that. Following the announcement of Juliano’s step-down, the price of the dYdX’s token experienced a decline, dropping by approximately 1.2% in the past 24 hours to a trading price of $2.01, with a 24-hour low of $1.94. This downturn contrasts with the general recovery in the crypto market, highlighted by a 2.8% increase in Bitcoin over the same period.

The order to shut it down said it's using foreign-source technology that poses national-security concerns.  President Joe Biden ordered a cryptocurrency mining facility near Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming to halt operations on Monday, calling it a threat to national security.  The White House order said the British Virgin Islands company behind MineOne, which is majority owned by Chinese nationals, must remove all the improvements and mining equipment on the property located within a mile of the military facility in Cheyenne – a base that houses Minuteman III nuclear missiles.  The company, which bought the property in 2022, was accused of acquiring the land and starting work there without filing with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), and a tip started an investigation into that acquisition, according to the White House.  The order, which also authorized the U.S. attorney general to ""take any steps necessary"" to enforce it, cited the ""presence of specialized equipment on the property used to conduct cryptocurrency mining operations, some of which is foreign-sourced and presents significant national security concerns,"" according to a related statement from the Department of the Treasury.  The move ""highlights the critical gatekeeper role that CFIUS serves to ensure that foreign investment does not undermine our national security, particularly as it relates to transactions that present risk to sensitive U.S. military installations as well as those involving specialized equipment and technologies,” Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen said in a statement.

But amid this consolidation and even fear of more losses, one analyst has shared data suggesting that long-term holders are accumulating at spot rates. Are We Back To 2021? Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Accumulating In a post on X, the analyst noted that this re-accumulating pace is picking up momentum, mirroring a welcomed trend that preceded the impressive 2021 bull run. Therefore, if long-term holders, or HODLers, accumulate, the probability of BTC rallying in the sessions ahead is elevated. Thus far, BTC has been trending above $60,000, up 10% from the May 2024 lows. For clarity, the data shared by the analyst uses Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to classify long-term and short-term holders. Analyzing the age of UTXOs makes it easier to gauge the behavior of different investor groups. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Injective (INJ) Breakout: $50 Price Range On The Horizon Usually, UTXOs older than 155 days have “diamond hands” or long-term holders. Meanwhile, those who hold BTC for less than 155 days are short-term holders or often classified as “weak” hands. They are usually traders or speculators interested in riding on price volatility, like in the first half of Q1 2024. When long-term holders stopped distributing BTC in 2021, prices rose sharply. By November 2021, the coin had peaked at around $70,000, lifting prices by nearly 1,500% from 2020 lows. It is unclear if BTC is ready for another 15X surge from spot rates, a move that would propel it to over $700,000. BTC Has Strong Support At $60,000, Analyst Urges Patience While the on-chain data paints a bullish picture, some analysts advocate caution. Taking to X, one analyst notes that Bitcoin has strong support at around the psychological $60,000 mark. The coin could stabilize if bulls soak in selling pressure and reject attempts for lower lows. However, if prices dump below $60,000, triggered by a news event, BTC may fall to as low as the $52,000 to $55,000 zone. Despite the potential for short-term volatility, the analyst encourages investors to maintain a long-term perspective. Accumulating Bitcoin at these levels and exercising patience could be a winning strategy, the analyst says. Related Reading: DOGE Price Prediction – Can Dogecoin Bulls Overcome This Hurdle? This preview would be especially true now that on-chain data shows that long-term holders are accumulating. Before then, traders should watch price action. The coin is moving sideways, finding rejection at $66,000. Even though prices are lower, the last day’s series of higher highs is encouraging and might spark demand.

42408254,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBnaT,1715632062,"Why, for Some, Crypto Is the Defining Political Issue of Our Times","With all due respect to Molly Jane Zuckerman and Jeff Albus, the co-authors of a recent Blockworks column discounting the idea of voting for pro-crypto politicians in the upcoming election in the U.S., voting your conscience is a good thing. Despite the headline (“Only a fool would vote on crypto alone”), the piece was fairly measured – but it certainly struck a nerve.  Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates. This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  “Voting for a candidate you would not otherwise support, simply because they favor the deregulation of a sector in which you hold a profit motive, is a compromise that you should not make,” editors Zuckerman and Albus wrote. They certainly aren’t the first to express this sentiment. Fortune editor Jeff John Roberts has argued that crypto’s increasing alignment with Trump supporters like Sen. Tom Emmer is a bad deal.  While all these folks are right to some extent that political support for crypto is often more about peoples’ bags rather than a moral crusade, it is undeniable that crypto is an increasingly relevant political issue. And for some, it is the defining issue of our times. Crypto isn’t just an investment opportunity, it’s a movement, a philosophy and a way of life – and there are true believers.  Zuckerman and Albus’ issue is nominally about crypto becoming a “single-issue vote,” whether cast in favor of Democrat or Republican candidates – but in reality, the whole conversation they tapped into is really about whether to vote for Trump. For some crypto supporters, the issue is existential; another four years of Biden means more wanton regulation by enforcement, more gridlock preventing actual crypto legislation and more anti-crypto rhetoric coming from the highest political office.  During President Biden’s reign, U.S. legislators and regulators have become increasingly hostile to crypto, and their actions are undeniably having an outsized impact on the direction of an entire global industry. Just last week, for instance, re-staking platform EigenLayer, called one of the most important blockchain innovations since the launch of Ethereum a decade ago, was heavily criticized for designing a highly restrictive airdrop. But, under the current regulatory regime, it was essentially EigenLayer’s only move unless it wanted to invite a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit.  It is true that crypto has bipartisan support, however it is clear (and frankly has been for years) that crypto gets more love from Republicans. Politico reports that a critical vote – “the first time a full chamber of Congress has taken up a big crypto policy bill” – is essentially dead on arrival with a Democrat controlled House and Senate. Meanwhile, the most vocal supporters of crypto in office today are Republicans, figures like Sens. Emmer and Cynthia Lummis.  So can you really blame people like Ryan Selkis, Mike Dudas or Mark Cuban for thinking if they want decent crypto policy in the U.S., the industry has to align itself with Republicans?  Critics might be right in saying that former President Donald Trump, who gave a ringing endorsement of crypto at a Mar-a-Lago dinner last week, only recently took a shine to crypto because he’s made millions selling NFTs or because it’s another way for him to paint President Biden as out of touch. But these moments count. At a time when the entire U.S. crypto industry feels like it’s under assault by the government, it is likely a welcome feeling knowing someone with as much influence as Trump is willing to speak out in support.  See also: Will Biden Get the Final Say Over a Controversial Crypto Rule? | Opinion  I understand that many people think crypto’s vote being cast for Trump is like drinking from a poisoned chalice. After all, when in office, Trump’s cabinet tried (and failed) to push through emergency rules that would have banned “self-hosted wallets,” i.e. exactly what makes crypto a viable technology in the first place. There is no guarantee that if reelected Trump would actually be any more favorable to crypto than Biden is currently; and it seems highly unlikely that either candidate fully understands or appreciates why crypto is technologically potent.  I understand that, ideally, voters should care more about things like abortion, environmental and immigration policy than crypto. (Most probably do.) I understand Zuckerman and Albus’ distaste for Trump, his sexual assault charges, alleged fraud and election denialism. I understand why, optically, crypto casting itself as conservative is a dubious proposition, an expedient way to get 40+% of the population to turn their minds against it, as Laura Shin astutely pointed out.  See also: Crypto Is an Election Issue This Year. Is That a Good Thing? | Opinion  But I also understand why figures like Selkis are championing crypto into a political cause. Actually, they are simply noticing that crypto already was a partisan issue and acting in accordance. It’s common to hear that because blockchains strive to be “credibly neutral” that the industry itself is apolitical, but that simply isn't true. Crypto is a check on the government; it is and always has been a political project. As I wrote in 2021:  “If Bitcoin solved the climate crisis, it would be through successful, freer markets – not progressive planning. If Bitcoin expands access to basic financial services, it could never solve economic inequality – you cannot redistribute early Bitcoiners’ massive holdings without destroying the system’s technologically protected property rights. If Bitcoin prevents war by diminishing the power of the state, it will also dismantle the progressive welfare state.”  To be clear: I’m not arguing for anyone to vote in any particular way. Frankly, I agree that ideally crypto wouldn’t be an election issue. I wish it weren’t politicized. But crypto exists in the context of all other issues, and is currently being affected by politics. And it’s perfectly natural that people who think about and use crypto everyday would elevate it as the most important issue – especially considering that it’s not only a philosophy but an investment.  It is unclear why anyone would suggest people vote against their interests. For some, crypto is a microcosm of all else that’s important – because in the end, it’s all about letting people determine for themselves what to value.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION | AIRDROP,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2024/05/13/why-for-some-crypto-is-the-defining-political-issue-of-our-times,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/92d3d95b3369430e3beda9c3b448a2cbc56184f4-2048x1151.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The analyst is known to have called the crypto token’s previous high correctly, which is one reason his latest prediction is worth keeping an eye on. Solana Could Rise To As High As $453 Marks mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that despite its recent pullback, Solana’s price may be getting ready for another price rally. He noted that a move of over 54% may already be in the pipeline and that such a price move could open up room for another run of over 93%, which would send Solana to $453. Related Reading: Cardano Ready For 15x Move, Crypto Analyst Reveals The Major Drivers Source: X Marks predicted last year that Solana would climb above $200, which it eventually did this year, peaking at a year-to-date (YTD) high of $202. Although the crypto token has dropped significantly from that price level, Marks’ recent prediction confirms that Solana’s run isn’t done yet and will still surpass its current all-time high (ATH) of $260. Solana rising to $453 looks more feasible considering that crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have predicted that the crypto token could rise above $500 by year-end. Crypto analyst Hansolar also predicted that Solana could climb to $600 in this market cycle. Meanwhile, Crypto YouTuber Jake Gagain predicted that Solana will rise to $750, although he mentioned that it will likely happen in 2025. SOL Could Become The Third-Largest Crypto Token Solana’s rise to as high as $500 could lead to the crypto token becoming the third largest crypto asset by market cap, only behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. This is possible, as a rise to $500 is almost double Solana’s current ATH. Crypto analyst Chris O also previously predicted that this would likely happen as he predicted Solana and ADA would battle for the position. Meanwhile, asset manager Franklin Templeton also sounded confident in Solana’s potential to become the third-largest cryptocurrency. In a recent analysis, the asset manager highlighted the factors that could lead to this development. One is Solana’s technology, which they think will be perfect for the sectors that will drive the next wave of crypto adoption. Related Reading: US Mega Banks JP Morgan And Wells Fargo Unveil Bitcoin Exposure As BTC Drops To $60,000 Franklin Templeton also alluded to the upcoming airdrops on the Solana network, which could bring more liquidity into the ecosystem and possibly cause a surge in Solana’s price, just like when the Jito and Pyth airdrops occurred. The asset manager also noted that meme coin activity on the network isn’t slowing, which could contribute to Solana’s rise to becoming the third-largest cryptocurrency. Solana has become the foremost network for trading meme coins, which has led to an influx of new investors into the ecosystem. Therefore, a sustained network expansion will likely reflect positively on Solana’s price sooner or later. At the time of writing, Solana is trading at around $144, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

One of FalconX’s portfolio companies, FalconX Bravo, has been registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer since last August, according to the Monday settlement agreement.  The way in which FalconX conducted business for its institutional clients meant that accurate know-your-customer (KYC) information was often not provided to the crypto exchanges FalconX was trading with.  However, after the CFTC filed suit against Binance its former CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao for similar offenses in March 2023, FalconX voluntarily “changed and enhanced its approach to collecting customer-identifying information” – including requiring customers to identify the location of the assets’ ultimate beneficial owners, the location of their corporate headquarters, and the location of employees controlling the investor’s Edge account.  After these new, stricter KYC requirements were put in place, FalconX told the CFTC that Edge lost half of its customers.  In its settlement agreement, the CFTC said that FalconX’s remediation efforts – as well as its “substantial cooperation” with the investigation – resulted in a lower penalty than could have otherwise been imposed.  FalconX must pay $1,179,008 in disgorgement and a $589,504 civil penalty, and must cease and desist from acting as an unregistered FCM.

Investors pulled nearly $40 million out of the six spot bitcoin and ether ETFs on the first day of the week.  The Hong Kong-listed spot bitcoin and ether exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw heavy outflows on Monday following bitcoin’s drop below $61,000 on Friday.  The spot bitcoin ETFs from issuers ChinaAMC, Harvest Global, as well as Bosera and Hashkey, saw a combined $32.7 million outflows on Monday, according to data from Farside Investors. This number is significantly higher than previous outflows, which hovered around the $6 million mark.  Monday marked the first time that all six crypto ETFs, including both bitcoin {{BTC}} and Ether {{ETH}}, reported negative flows since their launch on May 2. Harvest Global had previously not yet seen outflows for its spot bitcoin fund.  The spot ether ETFs saw $6.6 million in outflows which is also significantly higher than past numbers.  After eight days of trading, investors pulled roughly $13 million out of the six ETFs, a disappointing result for the Asia-based ETFs when compared to the initial excitement phase around its U.S.-listed counterparts.  Many industry enthusiasts have pointed out that the overall Hong Kong-based ETF market is relatively small, with about $50 billion in assets. In comparison, the ETF market in the U.S. is estimated at approximately $9 trillion in assets under management.

27747721,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607862,1715628421,GameStop Stock And Wolverine Memecoins Explode As Roaring Kitty Returns To The Spotlight,"GameStop, the video game retailer that took Wall Street by storm in 2021, has once again become the talk of the town as its share price surges 100%. Fueling this rally is the return of the influential social media figure Keith Gill’s “Roaring Kitty.” After a long hiatus, Roaring Kitty’s recent activity on social platforms, including an image and video, has ignited excitement among investors and triggered a renewed frenzy for GameStop’s meme stock and the emerging world of memecoins. GameStop Memestock Frenzy The meme-stock phenomenon gained widespread attention in 2021 when cash-rich investors pumped up the stock market and bet against short-selling hedge funds. Keith Gill’s “TheRoaringKitty” account and the subreddit “WallStreetBets” played a pivotal role in the meme stock frenzy, driving stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment to surge over 1,000% by the end of the same year. While some early investors reaped rich returns, hedge funds such as Gabe Plotkin’s Melvin Capital Management suffered significant losses, leading to closures. Related Reading: Investment Firm Makes Bitcoin Its Strategic Reserve – Impact On Price According to Bloomberg, short sellers betting against GameStop initially enjoyed gains in the year’s first four months. Still, the volatile nature of meme stocks quickly erased those paper gains. Per the report, “skeptics” were up an estimated $400 million from January to April before slipping into the red by Monday morning. The percentage of GameStop shares sold short relative to those available for trading has remained at approximately 24%, a relatively high level for a typical company but significantly lower than the 140% levels witnessed during the 2021 mania. As GameStop’s shares gained momentum, the cost to bet against the company increased. Recent data from S3 indicates borrowing costs exceeding a 10% annual financing fee range. Roaring Kitty’s Ripple Effect Roaring Kitty’s influence extended beyond GameStop, as Wolverine-themed memecoins flooded various blockchains. In response to a social media post featuring a video of Marvel superhero Wolverine, more than 30 new tokens were launched on platforms like Ethereum and Solana, as data by Dextools shows. Notably, the newly minted “Roaring Wolverine” token on the Ethereum blockchain experienced an astonishing 80% surge within hours of its release. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Analyst Reveals Key Price Levels To Watch Furthermore, the memecoin market has witnessed a notable resurgence, with tokens such as Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), Pepe (PEPE), Dogwifhat (WIF), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Bonk Inu (BONK) recording significant gains, according to CoinGecko data. For instance, PEPE, the market leader, surged by 15% in the past 24 hours, complementing its 20% uptrend over the previous week. It reached a new high of $0.00001077 during early Monday trading. Ultimately, GameStop’s meme stock resurgence, fueled by the return of Roaring Kitty, inflicted substantial losses on short sellers of the meme stock on Monday. The impact of Roaring Kitty’s social media presence has extended to the memecoin market, with several Wolverine-themed tokens experiencing significant surges.

27746714,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607739,1715626844,Investment Firm Makes Bitcoin Its Strategic Reserve – Impact On Price,"Early-stage investment firm Metaplanet announced on Monday that it’s adopting Bitcoin (BTC) as its sole “strategic treasury reserve asset.” This audacious decision signals a growing confidence in the controversial cryptocurrency as a legitimate store of value and hedge against traditional economic woes. Related Reading: CEO Drops Bombshell: Trump Campaign Eyes Crypto-Friendly Policies Yen Under Pressure, Bitcoin On The Rise Metaplanet’s decision comes amidst a backdrop of sustained economic pressures in Japan. A weakening yen, coupled with high government debt levels and persistently low-interest rates, seems to have pushed the firm to seek alternative havens for its reserves. Bitcoin, with its finite supply and decentralized nature, appears to be their answer. ‘Bitcoin-First, Bitcoin-Only’ Approach In a clear statement of intent, Metaplanet outlined its new “Bitcoin-first, Bitcoin-only approach” to treasury management. The company plans to strategically convert its existing yen liabilities and future share issuances into BTC, effectively accumulating more of the digital asset over time. This strategy echoes the recent moves of US-based MicroStrategy, which has become a major institutional holder of Bitcoin. A screenshot of Metaplanet's press release. Believing In The ‘Absolutely Scarce’ Asset Metaplanet’s press release paints a glowing picture of the top crypto asset’s potential. They view it as “fundamentally superior” to traditional currencies and other investment options, highlighting its scarcity and lack of a central issuer. They are impressed by Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, emphasizing how it creates a progressively higher cost of production for the remaining coins yet to be mined. This, they argue, stands in stark contrast to traditional commodities whose supply can be readily increased. Bitcoin is now trading at $62.896. Chart: TradingView Following The Footsteps Of A Corporate Bitcoin Believer There are clear parallels between Metaplanet’s strategy and that of MicroStrategy. The US firm has aggressively amassed Bitcoin, currently holding over 1% of the entire circulating supply. Metaplanet, though smaller, has reportedly acquired over 117 BTC since April, signaling their commitment to replicating this strategy. While Metaplanet’s decision reflects a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, it also carries significant risks. Bitcoin’s price remains highly volatile, with the potential for substantial losses if the market takes a downturn. Additionally, the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies is still evolving, and future regulations could negatively impact Bitcoin’s viability as a reserve asset. Related Reading: Analyst Predicts Injective (INJ) Breakout: $50 Price Range On The Horizon A Digital Canary In The Coal Mine? Metaplanet’s bold move serves as a fascinating case study. Their all-in bet on Bitcoin raises questions about the future of traditional reserve assets and the potential for wider adoption of cryptocurrencies by institutional investors. Impact On Bitcoin Price The company’s investment, while significant for a single firm, represents a relatively small portion of the total Bitcoin market capitalization. However, the news itself could generate positive sentiment and short-term price increases, especially if it entices other institutional investors to follow suit. Conversely, if Metaplanet’s strategy backfires and they are forced to sell their Bitcoin holdings at a loss, it could trigger a broader sell-off and price decline. Ultimately, the long-term impact will depend on how this bold move by Metaplanet plays out, alongside broader market forces and evolving regulations.

42408262,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBnr0,1715626673,Cautious Bitcoin Bounce to Face Inflation Data Hurdles Later This Week,"The spot ETF catalyst for bitcoin has faded, putting added import on macro factors  Inflation data coming Tuesday and Wednesday is likely to set at least the short-term tone for the market.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} has managed a modest rally over the past 72 hours after an ugly close to last week, but three major economic reports later this week are among the factors that will likely set off more volatility.  At press time, the world's largest crypto was trading at $62,700, up 2% over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data, and ahead 4% from Friday's low. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index was higher by 1.25% over the past 24 hours.  With spot bitcoin ETF buying slowing to a near halt and even going net negative on some days, macro catalysts have taken on greater importance of late. That was evident Friday morning U.S. hours when an unexpected rise in consumer inflation expectations combined with hawkish remarks from Dallas Fed President Lori Logan to send bitcoin tumbling $3,000 in minutes from the $63,300 level.  Inflation data on the docket  The next negative or positive catalysts are likely to come from U.S. inflation reports, namely the Producer Price Index (PPI) set for release on Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) 24 hours later.  Of the two, the CPI report is of more import and economists are forecasting that gauge to have risen 0.4% in April, in line with the March advance. The annual pace of headline CPI is seen slowing to 3.4% from 3.5% in March. The so-called core CPI – which strips out food and energy costs – is expected to rise 0.3% in April versus 0.4% in March, with the annual pace falling to 3.6% from 3.8%.  It's stubbornly high inflation which has thrown a wrench into market expectations for a series of Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024. To date, there have been exactly zero rate cuts and markets are now pricing in an 11% chance the Fed sits on its hands for the remainder of the year, according to CME FedWatch. Another fast inflation report might not just have traders abandoning hope of any easier monetary policy in 2024, but could have them begin to price in odds of the Fed's next move being an increase in benchmark rates.  Other data and Powell speaks  Wednesday will also bring the U.S. government's retail sales report for April, which shouldn't be overlooked as an important data point. Alongside high inflation, the U.S. economy has shown little sign that it's in need of lower rates. Though there's been a modest slowdown of late, employment gains continue to impress each month and the retail sales numbers show healthy consumer spending.  Economist forecasts are for retail sales to have grown 0.4% in April versus 0.7% in March. Ex-auto and gas, retail sales in April are seen rising just 0.1% versus 1.0% in March.  Investors will also get to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who at 10 a.m. ET on Tuesday is scheduled to take part in a moderated discussion with Dutch central bank Governor Klaas Knot at the annual general meeting of the Foreign Bankers' Association in Amsterdam. Powell earlier in May brushed off ideas that the U.S. economy risked falling into ""stagflation"" - a term made famous during the 1970s that signifies slow or negative economic growth combined with speedy inflation.  ""I see no 'stag' nor 'flation,"" said Powell at a press conference on May 1.

27744319,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607734,1715623258,Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Analyst Reveals Key Price Levels To Watch,"In his latest technical analysis, veteran crypto analyst Christopher Inks offers a detailed look at the current Bitcoin market structure through a comprehensive chart analysis. The chart, recently shared on X, shows Bitcoin’s price movements alongside several key technical indicators and levels that could signal a potential reversal from its bearish trend. The analyst illustrates Bitcoin’s price action with daily candlesticks over the past few months, pinpointing significant support (S1, S2) and resistance (R1, R2) levels. As of press time, Bitcoin traded at around the $63,000 mark, encapsulated by two descending trend lines which represent a bearish market structure. The Bottom Signal For Bitcoin “We still want to see a breakout above the noted level to signal a break in the bearish market structure that began at the ATH,” Inks stated. This level is of paramount importance because it serves as a junction of multiple technical elements: the daily pivot point, the upper descending green resistance line, and the two-month range equilibrium. Related Reading: Bitcoin On-Chain Activity Nearing Historic Lows – What This Means For BTC Price According to Inks, “an impulsive breakout and close above the daily pivot/descending green resistance/2-month range EQ confluence area will signal that the low is likely in.” This suggests that overcoming this barrier could herald the end of the bearish market structure that commenced from the all-time high. If this resistance breaks, the next major resistance is located at $65,541. Afterwards, $68,000 could be on the cards. “Breaking above this level breaks the bearish market structure from March 13th,” according to Inks. Then, R1 at $69,000 and R2 at around $78,000 could be the next targets. On the downside, the most crucial support is at $56,522. It represents the lower boundary that Bitcoin needs to maintain to prevent a new low, which would exacerbate the bearish sentiment. Related Reading: US Mega Banks JP Morgan And Wells Fargo Unveil Bitcoin Exposure As BTC Drops To $60,000 Inks articulates the importance of this support, noting, “If we can print a higher low now, which would require a breakout above the $65.541 level without printing a new low below $56,522, then that would really add support for the idea that the bottom is in and a new ATH is incoming.” This statement underlines the necessity for Bitcoin to hold above this support to avoid further declines and stabilize within its current range. If BTC breaks below the pivotal support, the price could be headed below $56,000 (S1) and $50,90 (S2). Notably, the analysis is supported by a variety of technical indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), hovering around the neutral 50 mark, suggests a balancing act between bullish and bearish forces. The RSI’s position indicates that the market is neither overbought nor oversold, leaving room for potential upward movement if bullish signals strengthen. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) currently shows that the MACD line is below the signal line, a traditional bearish sign. However, the proximity of these lines also hints at a possible upcoming bullish crossover, should the momentum shift. The Stochastic RSI also indicates potential for movement in either direction but is particularly useful for identifying when Bitcoin might be entering overbought or oversold territories, which are critical for predicting short-term price reversals. Inks also commented on the market’s dynamics, stating, “The positives of the range are that supply has continued to decrease throughout the bearish market structure.” This observation suggests that diminishing supply, paired with maintaining key support levels, could help stabilize and potentially increase Bitcoin’s price. At press time, BTC traded at $62,902.

The letter argues that services such as Tornado Cash aren't money transmitters, and it says that earlier Treasury Department views on transmitters bear this out.  A bipartisan pair of U.S. senators is questioning Attorney General Merrick Garland about the ""unprecedented interpretation"" of law the Department of Justice (DOJ) is using to pursue cryptocurrency software services as unlicensed money-transmitting businesses.  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) sent a letter to Garland questioning the approach against such firms as Samourai Wallet and Tornado Cash, highlighting that the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has previously held that non-custodial crypto services shouldn't be treated as money transmitters.  ""I’m concerned the DOJ’s interpretation would treat software developers as criminals for merely writing and publishing code used by others – a dangerous precedent that contradicts decades of settled law and raises serious First Amendment concerns,"" Wyden said in a statement on Monday.  Samourai was the most recent crypto privacy business pursued by federal prosecutors last month. The lawmakers' letter, dated May 9, argued that ""subjecting developers of non-custodial crypto asset software to potential criminal liability as unregistered money transmitters contravenes the well-established interpretation of this provision.""  The DOJ also argued in a court filing that FinCEN's guidance addressing crypto mixers didn't address the idea of ""control,"" a stance that the senators' letter took issue with. In its filing from last month, the DOJ said anything that facilitates the transfer of funds would meet the legal definition of a ""money transmitter,"" likening the wallet to a USB cable that transfers data or a frying pan that transfers heat.  The lawmakers' letter said the rule does actually require the service to take control of the funds to be treated as a transmitter.

However, crypto investors are no longer ignoring these altcoins and have begun to call out the opportunities in these cryptocurrencies. Theta Network Is Looking At A Breakout Crypto analyst CobraVanguard has called out an interesting formation in the THETA chart that suggests that a massive breakout might be on the horizon. In the analysis which was posted on the TradingView website, the analyst points out that a bull flag is currently being formed. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In? Buy The Dip Sentiment Erodes Amid Drop Toward $60,000 This bull flag pattern started with the most recent decline below the $2 price level after a period of brief dips and recoveries. Interestingly, since this bull flag pattern is still only forming, it does not mean that the breakout will happen immediately. CobraVanguard’s chart shows that there will be more uncertain movements in the THETA price, coupled with the possibility of the price actually falling below $1.9. At the same time, the crypto analyst points out that the price is currently bouncing from the middle line around $1.99. Source: Tradingview.com However, once the formation is complete, then the breakout can happen. The upper end of the target presented by CobraVanguard shows that the THETA price can rise as high as $3.7. This would mean an almost 100% increase in price from its current level. Holding Up Well Amid Uncertainty 2024 has been a rather eventful year for Theta Network. The network’s native token, THETA, had begun the year trending below $1. However, within the month of March alone, it saw an over 250% increase, going from $1.1 to over $3.7 before correcting back downward. Since then, the THETA price has lost around 40% of its value. But this is only due to the negative headwinds that can be attributed to the decline in the Bitcoin price. The altcoin has moved upward in the market since then, rising over a $2 billion market cap to become the 51st-largest cryptocurrency in the space. Related Reading: Ex-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Says Bitcoin Will Reach $1 Million, Here’s When Amid the broader market downturn, THETA is still seeing positive metrics, especially when it comes to its volume.

At the time of writing, the THETA price is seeing small daily gains of 1.47% to trade at $2.02. However, on the weekly and monthly timeframes, the altcoin has performed poorly, dropping 13.73% and 12.97%, respectively.

42408270,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBo4E,1715618213,"‘We're Doing it, We Believe in it’: The Sandbox’s Nicola Sebastiani on Bringing Gaming to the Metaverse","Since at least 2021, you could trace the arc of crypto by following the word “metaverse.” It was once filled with buzz and hype and potential to be The Next Big Thing — even Facebook changed its name to Meta — and then lost its luster during Crypto Winter, as prices plunged and excitement cooled.  But look closer. It’s now a cliche that many in the Web3 space “kept building” during the bear market, but it’s a cliche that has the ring of truth. And people kept building in the metaverse. “It’s thriving,” says Nicola Sebastiani, Chief Content Officer of The Sandbox. He calls this the “Year of the Creators,” as 280,000 Sandbox users are actively creating games and experiences.  Nicola Sebastiani is a speaker at this year’s Consensus festival, in Austin, Texas, May 29-31.  A big focus of The Sandbox is user-generated content, and another is partnerships with blue chip IP. The Sandbox now has 484 partnerships that range from The Walking Dead to Care Bears to Snoop Dogg to a splashy new deal with “The Voice.”  In the run-up to Consensus, Sebastiani shares what users can soon expect from The Sandbox, his predictions for the future of the metaverse, and why he shrugs off the ups and downs of the hype cycle, as “We're doing it, we believe in it. It's what we stand for.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Bring us up to speed on what’s happening in The Sandbox. How many users do you have? What are people doing in the world?  Nicola Sebastiani: So, the current environment is great. The Sandbox has had about 5.8 million, almost 6 million accounts created. This year, for us, is the Year of the Creators. And that is really the focus for the company.  About 280,000 users have experimented and used our Game Maker tool, which is the engine that creators use for experiences, and our VoxEdit tool, which is the engine that users use to create assets. [Note: For a much deeper dive into these tools, you can check out my profile of The Sandbox from 2021.]  We ran a variety of initiatives for creators, where they can find new ways to create new experiences and win Sand and other rewards like Land. Often those experiences are tied to IP like Avenged Sevenfold or Care Bears or Gordon Ramsay. And we continue to host a variety of events based on music or specific franchises, like the Smurfs. There’s a big focus on user-generated content.  What are some of your favorite experiences or games being built?  Recently we ran this Game Jam themed around cooking, and “Hell's Kitchen.” It was amazing to see a cooking simulators game built with such ingenuity. And there are incredible UGC [User Generated Content] studios around the world, such as VauxMachina Studios in Southeast Asia, that are really pushing the boundaries in terms of what can be made with no-coding. I like what our own proprietary studios are capable of making with some of our biggest franchises. Like Snoop Dogg experiences, and a lot that we do in music — We worked with Perry Seleton, Steve Aoki, and several other DJs.  You can find literally something for every flavor. You can go in and explore a museum. And you don’t even really need to play; you can just explore and lose yourself in the metaverse.  You said that this is the Year of the Creators. What’s the next chapter for The Sandbox? What can people look forward to?  Well, I think there's a lot coming up this year. It's not going to be just about creators. And, in fact, towards the second part of the year, we will have a couple of very meaningful moments dedicated to the player, the user. Although we're not ready to announce the details, I think people have been eagerly waiting for those.  There's a continuous advancement in our Game Maker and the new features it can bring, and how it can make experiences stronger and stronger. And over the next, I'd say, a couple of months, we're going to keep announcing partnerships because we’re lucky to have a lot of established brands and IP wanting to work with us.  You have literally hundreds of partnerships. What’s one you’re especially excited about?  Well, today we announced our partnership with ""The Voice."" That's something that our production teams have been hard at work on. We did an experience where you essentially go through the journey of ""The Voice"" with judges, with deciding your style, deciding the winner, and all that. I encourage you to test that.  I’m sure you know better than anyone that the word “metaverse” has had something of a roller-coaster in the past three years. First there was lots of hype, then it cooled off during crypto winter, and for some the word became almost a punchline. How have you and The Sandbox navigated all that, and how has this change in reputation impacted you?  I think the metaverse remains the vision behind the company, the foundation behind why we're doing what we're doing, first and foremost for our founders. And that cascades down into everybody at the company. So, we see it as a long-term goal. We see it as a group of companies of today and of tomorrow that are building together.  Yes, the metaverse buzz diminished for the public. However, in the broader gaming aspect, we really entered the world of user-generated content with some of the biggest gaming platforms, including, for example, Fortnite. We're doing it, we believe in it. It's what we stand for. And it is probably one of the biggest trends in interactive media today.  Give us a prediction for what the metaverse will be like in five years.  [Laughs.] In five years, you’ll check in on me about the prediction?  No no no, you’re off the hook! The Prediction Police won’t come after you.  Okay, no worries. I think it will be multi-platform and will include a strong AR and VR element as well. Interoperability of avatars. Purchases. And most features will be done in a seamless way with other metaverses from partner companies. I think it will have an even stronger economic impact on creators, where people will be learning guitar on it, or teaching languages. Or who knows, even doing corporate jobs.  It will have a strong virtual tourism side, where if you want to learn about the museum, or a financial institution, or a cultural event, you can go in interactively. And the beauty is that it’s going to be extremely decentralized. A lot of this will be owned by users all around the world, and not by the Sandbox. So much of the innovation will happen from that.  Love it. What are you most looking forward to at Consensus?  Many of the panels. I’m blown away by the quality of the speakers that are there. In fact, I wonder what I'm doing there compared to them.  I think you’re in the right place.

Crypto goes 24/7 without any circuit breakers, unlike the stock market.  GameStop (GME) is yet again the stock of the day, soaring Monday due to support from traders gripped by meme-stock fever.  But it was a stilted rally, halted repeated by the U.S. stock market's famous – or infamous, depending on one's perspective – system of ""circuit breakers"" designed to prevent prices from getting out of control.  And that has enthusiasts of cryptocurrencies, where markets go 24/7 with no circuit breakers (except for the occasional exchange malfunction), laughing.  The U.S. stock market got circuit breakers in stages following the harrowing crash of October 1987, initially set up as a brief whole-market shutdown in case of a rapid collapse and then later, following the so-called flash crash of May 2010, more tailored toward restraining individual stocks.  These are government-mandated things. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is credited with inventing the marketwide one after the 1987 crash. ""The circuit breaker that I invented restores calm,"" he told a CoinDesk reporter at a prior job.  Yet there are criticisms. If markets plunge but they're frozen, traders can't immediately swoop in and buy, driving prices back up. After Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} plunged to 10 cents from $317.81 in less than a second back in June 2017, Coinbase said it was considering introducing circuit breakers. It never did. Within 10 seconds, it was back above $300, an executive said at the time in an interview with Bloomberg.

Analyst Anticipates Further Upside,"In the midst of recent market turbulence and widespread speculation about the future of Bitcoin, cryptocurrency analyst and trader, Crypto Jelle has offered an optimistic outlook for BTC, affirming that the crypto asset’s bull run is far from over, indicating its potential to rally even further in the upcoming months. The Strength Of Bitcoin Is Underestimated Crypto Jelle’s analysis delves into Bitcoin’s current consolidation and the significance of the level. Following the recently concluded fourth Bitcoin Halving event, many people expect BTC to display immense price movement on the upside. However, the coin has not fully lived up to the expectations of several community members and crypto enthusiasts due to its present price consolidation. According to the Crypto Jelle, these people are actually underestimating how strong Bitcoin has proven to be thus far in this cycle. Jelle pointed out that the Halving event was only a few weeks ago, and BTC has been consolidating around the prior cycle’s all-time highs for several months now, suggesting a noteworthy development in comparison to past trends. As a result, the analyst believes the Bitcoin bull run is not over yet, predicting prices to reach a 6-digit level in the foreseeable future. The post read: People underappreciate the strength Bitcoin has shown so far this cycle. The halving event happened mere weeks ago, and yet we’ve been consolidating around the previous cycle ATHs for months. This run is not over. Bring on 6-figure BTC. Addressing the recent price corrections, Jelle claims pullbacks in the bull market are essential in order to rid the markets of enthusiasm and greed. Following weeks of Bitcoin gradually declining, particularly by 23%, market optimism has subsided, and it is now seen as audacious to be bullish. Related Reading: Timing The Breakout: When Will Bitcoin Escape The Post-Halving Consolidation? Thus, Crypto Jelle underscores that the potential of this market to surge higher lies within the crypto community members’ confidence in the market amidst troubling times like this. The crypto analyst highlighted that Bitcoin is still trading within a 7-year-old channel. Should this post-Halving consolidation mirror past trends, the expert is confident that the best is still to come, predicting a break out from the 7-year-long channel could send BTC to the $100,000 price level. BTC Price Action Looking Good Crypto Jelle has also identified some indicators that show BTC’s price action today is looking good. Drawing attention to the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Jelle pointed out a bullish MACD cross below the zero line, marking the first higher low in a longer time. Due to this, Bitcoin’s price looks promising as it is almost done with its full reset. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin’s Post-Halving Rally Is Certain, Analyst Explains Also, looking at the 21-week EMA, the crypto asset has pulled back into the key support level at $62,408. Jelle, on the other hand, does not consider this development as one to be worried about, urging investors to stick to their Bitcoin investment. Presently, Bitcoin is demonstrating a bullish momentum, rising from around $60,790 to about $63,100. At the time of writing, BTC has increased by over 2% in the past day, trading at $62,570. Its market cap has also risen by 2.41%, while its trading volume is up by 69% in the last 24 hours.

The digital yuan is fraught with privacy concerns as it incorporates elements of blockchain technology so transactions are all theoretically traceable.  China's digital yuan, also known as e-CNY, is failing to catch on during a trial in which state employees receive their salary in the central bank digital currency (CBDC), according to a report by the South China Morning Post (SCMP).  Most of the early recipients immediately transfer the digital yuan balances to their bank accounts to spend as cash, the SCMP reported.  “I prefer not to keep the money in the e-CNY app, because there’s no interest if I leave it there,” Sammy Lin, one participant in the pilot, said. “There are also not so many places, online or offline, where I can use the e-yuan.”  Almost all developed countries are at least exploring the development of a CBDC as a digital complement to cash, with China the most advanced. The e-CNY has been undergoing trials across China since 2019, though there is no timeline for a national launch.  The CBDC is also fraught with privacy concerns as it incorporates elements of blockchain technology so transactions are all theoretically traceable.  That means consumers prefer to use online payment tools such as Alipay and WeChat Pay. Paying in physical cash also remains an option, though this is far less prevalent.

42408252,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBnXA,1715612115,Bitcoin Miner Marathon In Talks With Kenya to Help With Its Green Energy Ambitions,"Kenya has been consulting with bitcoin mining company Marathon Digital Holdings to hear its thoughts on energy and its crypto regime.  The African nation depends on renewable energy, which is seasonal and capital-intensive.  Marathon Digital (MARA), one of the largest bitcoin mining companies, has held talks with Kenya to help manage the country's renewable energy through mining and develop its crypto regime.  ""We've been working closely with the Kenyan government on how to optimize and monetize renewable energy assets,"" Jayson Browder, vice president of government affairs at MARA, told CoinDesk in an interview. Kenya's President William Ruto recently met up with the Marathon's team during an American Chamber of Commerce event hosted in Kenya.  Renewable energy was the source of over 80% of Kenya's electricity, according to 2022 data, and President Ruto said he plans to make this 100% by 2030. Kenya is close to being like other countries such as Congo and Uganda, which rely almost 100% on renewable energy, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.  Kenya's primary renewable power source is geothermal energy from the earth's crust, as well as wind and solar. Though geothermal energy is constant and not impacted by seasonality, other renewable energies can pose a problem for Kenya's power supply.  Enter Marathon, which believes that its technology can help solve this power management problem for Kenya.  One of the main hurdles of renewable energy is that electricity is only produced when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing, causing consistency and storage problems for the user. To make the most efficient use of these forms of energy, the power either needs to be stored or wasted, creating a need for a power management system to balance the grid.  Companies like Marathon can set up their bitcoin mining operations to act like a power management system, consuming the excess energy generated from these renewable sources. Miners can also shut down their operations to reduce usage so that other customers can continue to get their power without interruption, which helps balance the grid.  Since bitcoin mining operations can be very mobile, companies are able to set up sites wherever they are needed to help balance the power grid.  ""The technology is modular, we can co-locate these really anywhere, and if they're an intermittent source, like wind or solar, we're able to turn off our machines when the grid needs it, so we can balance the grid,"" Browder said.  The company also started a similar project in Paraguay last year involving a 100% renewable-powered bitcoin mining project. The project meant that MARA could co-locate mining sites by the power sources producing excess energy and monetize them.  ""So, the technology we bring to bear can help to monetize and optimize some of these energy assets,"" Browder said.  The Kenyan government did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comments on the story.  A crypto regime  The conversation between Marathon and Kenya may have started with renewable energy solutions, but it ended with the country's president asking for the company's thoughts on a crypto regime, according to Bowder.  Nations around the world are trying to build out their crypto regimes. Western countries like Europe and the U.K. have released new laws to help regulate this nascent technology, while African nations like South Africa have recently started licensing crypto firms.  ""The Kenyan government wants to be leaders in the technology and innovation space. Investing internally and bringing in leading companies to support this growth,"" Browder said in a statement. ""This includes building the right regulatory framework around digital assets to include a potential development of a cryptocurrency exchange (government or private sector).""  The purpose of the regulatory framework and crypto exchange would be to enable the Kenyan government to regulate both the trading and selling of crypto assets within its borders.

42408271,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gaBoKl,1715609453,"Trump and Biden Tied on Polymarket, Diverging From Polls","This week in prediction markets:  Polymarket is giving both Donald Trump and Joe Biden a 45% chance of winning the U.S. presidency – with former first lady Michelle Obama at 5% and wild card Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at 3%.  Bettors aren't decided on who is going to control the House and the Senate.  The Polymarket election contract for the U.S. general is giving a split decision on the chances of former President Trump and incumbent President Joe Biden getting elected, which puts it at odds with polls.  Currently, ""yes"" shares for Trump and Biden are both trading at 45 cents, indicating the market gives each candidate a 45% chance of winning. A share pays out $1 if the prediction turns out correct, and zilch if it doesn't.  Traders on the crypto-based prediction market have wagered a record-breaking $124.43 million on the election; of that, $28.25 million has been bet on or against the two leading candidates. Michelle Obama, wife of former President Barack Obama, is trading at 5%, while independent Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is at 3%.  This tie appears to come at Trump's expense, as the presence of longshot third-party contenders has helped Biden. Market data shows he's down one point in the last month while Biden is up three points.  With this tie, prediction markets are breaking away from national polls, which they had been tracking closely for a period (but not always), that give Trump campaign an edge over Biden.  Polls averaged by 538 show that Trump has a 0.7 percentage point lead over Biden – and Kennedy is coming in at 10% – whereas 270toWin gives Trump a 0.9 point margin.  At the same time, there's a wide range of leads that pollsters are giving Trump. Some, like polls conducted by Harris in association with Harvard, give Trump a seven-point lead (in a five-way race with Biden, RFK, and two outlier candidates). A late April poll from CNN gives Trump a nine-point lead. Others, like TIPP Insights, give Biden a slight lead. YouGov's poll for The Economist agrees with Polymarket on the tie.  The big change in the last few weeks has been a notable inflow of money into the Biden election contract – which has given the incumbent's odds a boost.  Months ago, when the contract was in its infancy, Trump led by a commanding margin: 53% compared to Biden's 33%, which was completely out of alignment with national polling. At the same time, more money was bet on or against Trump than Biden: $6.46 million to $4.6 million.  Read more: Trump MAGA Meme Coins Are the First Experiment in 'PoliFi'  Perhaps the numbers will even out as the pool of participants becomes more inclusive.  On PredictIt, the popular U.S. election market platform, traders favor Biden, with 50% odds, over Trump at 48%. Unlike Polymarket, which was banished from the U.S. under a regulatory settlement, PredictIt takes bets from Americans (for now, at least – last week the Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed to ban election contracts).  Then again, Polymarket's nine-figure volume on the presidential election dwarfs PredictIt's, which totals 13.9 million shares, meaning the dollar volume is less than $14 million.  Balance of power  On Nov. 5, voters aren't just going to elect a President, but also vote for their local Congressman and Senator, with all 435 House seats up for election and 33 Senate seats being contested.  Officially, the U.S. is a bicameral system, with the two legislative bodies working to craft bills that are sent to the president for signature. But the reality is the balance of power is a three-part affair, with the president able to reject what's sent to him, or bills dying from between the House and the Senate, or being substantially modified in the process.  Hence, the balance of power is key, and Polymarket bettors are sure that the Republicans will control the Senate, as two different contracts asking the same question are coming to similar conclusions.  In the first, which asks bettors about the balance of power post-2024 election, bettors are saying cumulatively between various options that they are approximately 77% sure Republicans will take the Senate.  A similar contract asks about Senate control specifically after the election, which gives Democrats a 27% chance and Republicans a 74% chance, slightly underplaying the odds of the other contract.  These two Senate-related contracts don't have a significant amount of money in them yet, so a more clear picture might emerge after they bulk up their treasuries. Regardless, with some pollsters reporting tight races and the possibility of ticket splitting it will be interesting to see how prediction markets shape up as election day gets closer.",NEUTRAL,없음,COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/13/trump-and-biden-tied-on-polymarket-diverging-from-polls,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/640400cf5824bb0adcc6c738e8e32f34e9ad1b58-1920x1349.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418246,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1Sv,1715609333,AI Agents Will Drive the Next Wave of Crypto Adoption,"In the 2000s, we stopped going into bank branches and started banking online. In 10 years time, do you think we will still be managing our finances this way?  I predict today’s online financial tools will soon look archaic as we increasingly manage our finances via agents - intelligent bots that conduct financial operations on our behalf.  Luke Saunders is a Partner at Delphi Ventures and CTO at Delphi Labs.  That may sound far-fetched, but agents are already here. A liquidation bot is an agent. An arbitrage bot is an agent. The person who created it can chill on their sofa while the agent runs in the background making them money. They are niche but there are thousands of such things performing on-chain actions today on behalf of others.  Bots/agents are not people. The world of aesthetically pleasing apps with nice buttons to click does not work for them. TradFi provides APIs, but these are often half baked, closed-source, with limited documentation and inconsistent with each other. It’s very difficult for an agent (or anyone honestly) to figure out how to use them.  As I wrote in a recent post on X, while crypto UX is cumbersome for humans, its transparent, open-source, and programmable nature is absolutely perfect for agents. Code is a first class citizen here. Everything an agent needs to figure out how to achieve a goal — the source code and the data — is public. Half-baked TradFi APIs can't compete with this. The best agents will be built on the best platform and there is no better platform than crypto.  How we get there  This isn’t our reality yet, but there is a path to get us there. Let’s jump back to the agents that exist today and explore how we get from here to there.  The agents mentioned earlier (liquidation bots, etc) meet the definition of an agent, being autonomous software entities, but they are still very basic. They are usually coded specifically for a single, narrow task and without any ChatGPT-like interface to receive instructions and deliver feedback.  Big firms like Jump and GSR are able to build more complex systems able to autonomously move money around and handle problems to some extent. But these companies have a lot of money and big teams of devs. It’s not so feasible for the little guy.  Crypto sometimes feels like a solution searching for a problem, but maybe it just happens to be the perfect financial system for the machines  Technology always progresses to lower the barrier, though. What previously took a computer the size of a house and a team of scientists is later achievable by a teenager and a phone.  As AI becomes more prevalent, the nuts and bolts of which smart contract functions to call, or comprehending the data within the contract’s state, can be abstracted away. This leaves the creator/owner able to give much higher level instructions while the agent figures out how to execute them.  We can see today that LLMs like GPT-4 are already capable of understanding the intent behind a user’s message, and reason intelligently about how to respond, while at the same time having read all of the text on the internet to inform its answer. So it’s not a big leap to imagine a text-based interface to an agent that has read all relevant crypto media, ingested and understood all the data from all the blockchains, AND has the ability to execute actions on-chain.  Think about what people in crypto are spending all their time doing today:  The airdrop hunter who is spending all day finding promising new projects which seem like they might do an airdrop, guessing which actions might be rewarded and then doing them. An agent can do all that.  The meme hunter who is following some internal algo for finding new meme-coins with signs of cultish community, then buying them, then selling when interest seems to wane. An agent can do all that.  But more importantly consider how the new AI agent interface paradigm simplifies the basics of finance:  You: “I have 100,000 USDC. Get me the best low risk yield you can find. I need instant access to it so don’t lock it up for more than a week.”  Agent: “No problem. I recommend an initial distribution of 50% in Aave, 20% in Ethena, 20% in X and 10% in Y. I will monitor rates and watch for changes in their risk levels, rebalancing as necessary.”  You: “Sounds good, do it.”  People wonder how MetaMask will ever get unseated, or how frontends can be decentralized. Perhaps the answer is in the future we don’t need frontends anyway, and MetaMask will be replaced by your in-agent wallet.  TradFi agents will exist, but agents built on crypto will be better. And that’s why this is important: if agents become more and more common as I expect they will, and crypto agents offer a better experience for users, then this drives more and more users, activity and value on-chain.

Tarun Chitra, the founder of the risk management, economic research and software optimization organization Gauntlet, is just one shining example. In a conversation with Chitra, this comes through. It seems there is no corner of crypto he hasn’t examined.  Chitra, who often takes his time to pause before answering questions, will be speaking at Consensus 2024, May 29-31, in Austin, Texas.  CoinDesk caught up with the bona fide DeFi celebrity known for his colorful style (hair, glasses and clothes) to talk about new financial primitives in crypto, artificial wombs and why he appreciates hecklers.  This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.  I thought maybe we could start off with a quick round of overrated/underrated. You could skip any of them or clarify your statements if you prefer.  Sure.  Life extension?  I have a very rough classification in my head of, like, passive versus active life extension. Passive is: I become healthier by eating better and maybe I take some supplements. Active is: I get all sorts of esoteric experimental therapies and, like, injections. You know what I mean, one involves surgeries and the other a simpler change in habits.  I was thinking more of the former.  Probably overrated. I think the latter is rated correctly.  Yeah. Healthy living is good.  But that's why I wanted to separate those.  Artificial wombs?  I actually think fairly rated. Maybe slightly underrated, actually. But not super underrated. I feel like they're getting a lot of hype.  CLOBs [central limit order book exchanges].  Overrated.  Could you say why?  I think we had the era of CLOBs as the only thing that worked. Then AMMs took off and CLOBs were like crap. And then in the perpetuals and low-latency blockchain worlds everyone was like “CLOBs are better, CLOBs are better.” Not that we have seen a lot of people necessarily going back to CLOBs, but I feel like the tide has shifted right now. People are constantly sh*ting on AMMs. So that's fine. But it feels like there's always this cyclic thing between the two.  See also: What Is an Automated Market Maker?  Dutch auctions?  One shot Dutch auctions are overrated. Multi-shot Dutch auctions are underrated.  Omnichains?  Can you define what you mean by omnichain for this context?  Honestly, not so much. It's just a term that I’ve seen pop up a lot recently, and I can’t tell what they are.  Yeah, well, I have found it to be more of a marketing term than anything real, to be totally honest. So overrated, it feels like it's not a real thing. It doesn't refer to a single technical thing that I could write down equations for and tell you like, “this is a guarantee you're getting from this.”  That was the impression that I got as well. This is maybe a mean one, but Aave.  Decline to answer.  Who are your intellectual heroes?  Paul Dirac. John von Neumann. I’m trying to think of a more recent one. The boring one is like the Terence Taos of the world. Is there someone who's not as famous? … Yeah, stick with those. Those are those well known enough, I feel like the other ones are way too niche.  Fair enough. You wrote about DAO governance in 2021. I was wondering if you think we've learned anything since then? if DAO governance has at all improved in the intervening years?  I think there's kind of this thing where the actual governance processes for a lot of DAO either worsened or improved. Either due to sclerosis or due to centralized takeover or whatever, there's lots of reasons for one or the other. I don't think there have been many new mechanisms that people have focused on because you don't get rewarded for improving a DAO mechanism.  See also: DAOs Beware: Neo-Imperialism Is on the Rise  With Compound, I feel like because of the way they launched, they actually got rewarded as a team for improving DAO mechanisms when they decentralized governance in 2020. But since then everyone who has innovated on governance has been generally outside of DeFi. And those haven't made it.  There's still a lot of mechanistic innovation that hasn't been done. And part of the reason that hasn't been done is it's underfunded relative to other things, right? Like you can raise much more money for making another robot than you could ever raise for a new governance system.  When is it appropriate for crypto to embrace financial nihilism? As in, lean into it?  Good question. Feels like we are currently leaning in. So I don't know if that's an answer to when it is appropriate – but hasn't it already happened? The problem for me is that financial nihilism is a real consumer application. Most other things considered crypto for consumers, people are like, it’s a scam, or a lie, or it doesn’t really need crypto at all it’d work fine as Web2 to me – I can go down the list.  Financial nihilism is a real consumer product. Like there's no there's no way around it. It's hard to get around the fact that they've found a way to make Binance more fun to someone who doesn't like looking at candles – and I think that's why Pump.fun exists. People love it because it's the same thing but it doesn't feel like it and that's a good consumer application.  This will disappoint all the people who raise millions of dollars to do consumer crypto, but it's just what it is.  Do you think Farcaster will ever fully supplant Crypto Twitter and would it be a loss to Farcaster if CT was recreated in full on Farcaster?  Farcaster is like where the refugees of the WAGMI [we are all gonna make it] movement of 2021 went. It was all people who really were genuine in the beginning about being part of the cult of toxic positivity. I feel like the ones who were earnest about it went and made Farcaster. I just don't feel the trader-type people are ever going to perfectly intermesh, so it doesn't seem possible to fully re-create the “degen side.” Farcaster is so much more wholesome.  Do you see any interesting financial primitives emerging that you think will become more and more important?  I mean, in general, I think re-staking comes under that. But things that let you not know what network you're on, but give you the same security guarantees of that network; re-staking is one version of that, aggregation stuff that people are doing and ZK-land is one version of that. I think that's the key to making the UX of the multi-chain world feel anywhere near as good as something like Solana.  There are concerns that there's already too much ETH staked or will soon be too much ETH staked. Do you buy into that argument? Is there an appropriate amount?  That honestly depends. I don't think there's a static, fixed quantity that will always forever be the right amount. It depends on usage. If it turns out there's a lot of usage of ETH in applications on-chain or in centralized exchanges, then it's kind of bad to have a lot of ETH staked because then there's no liquidity and you could run into a supply crunch.  On the other hand, if there is too little ETH staked, then yeah, of course, different types of attacks are possible. The biggest problem in some ways with proof-of-stake is that it’s easy to calculate the dollar-value of an attack. I can always just take 1/3 times the amount staked and figure out how expensive it is to attack.  See also: The Investor's Definitive Guide to Proof-of-Work  With proof-of-work, because people can join and leave, it takes a while to figure out how expensive an attack is and you can't figure it out quite as precisely. So the lower bound for proof-of-work is actually harder to estimate, and it’s actually harder to attack in some ways.  So I think it's always gonna be dynamic. Some new technologies will help reduce how much you have to have staked – that's the point of ZK and advanced cryptography, but it will never be constant. It really just depends on how much applications want to use, and if applications are using ether a lot.  How many pairs of glasses do you own?  Probably like 10.  And lastly, is there anything in particular that you're looking forward to at Consensus?  Doing another live podcast.  I was there last time. It was good!  Yeah, the live podcasts are fun. Especially if you get like an audience heckler.  I’ll try to think of something clever to heckle.

42418256,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1bB,1715608270,"No, Hong Kong's Crypto ETFs Aren't Available in Mainland China","The HKEX confirms that crypto ETFs aren't available to mainland China investors, despite persistent rumors otherwise  Hong Kong's crypto ETFs, because of their unique in-kind redemption model, would offer a means to bypass mainland China's capital controls  As the listing date for Hong Kong's crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) got closer, the rumors went into overdrive that they would be available to mainland Chinese traders via the Stock Connect, which allows mainland trading of Hong Kong equities.  And then the ETFs launched, and they still aren't available. But the rumor won't cease. The reality is that, while crypto is still available to mainland Chinese traders in limited amounts, having an ETF available with in-kind redemptions would open the floodgates of liquidity, posing a threat to Chinese capital controls.  Adding some fuel to the fire was a piece in the SCMP that said these ETFs would be available to mainland traders who have Hong Kong residency and brokerage accounts. That’s certainly true, but there’s a massive caveat: it's like saying that mainland Chinese with U.S. residency can open an American brokerage account and trade New York-listed stocks. This doesn't mean that they are available in mainland China, as the trading, by mainlanders with Hong Kong residency, is done in Hong Kong.  For this part, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (HKEX) confirmed that they are unavailable in mainland China when CoinDesk asked for a comment.  Controlling the Yuan  So why is this all a big deal?  Allowing mainland Chinese to trade these crypto ETFs would fly in the face of Beijing's monetary policy of controlling the ascent and descent of the Yuan (RMB), particularly as Hong Kong authorities allow for in-kind creation and redemptions thanks to the partnerships between ETF issuers and licensed crypto exchanges in the city, which the U.S. SEC prohibits.  China's capital controls are designed to regulate the inflow and outflow of money, preventing excessive currency fluctuations and capital flight, and maintaining the stability and value of the Yuan.  This controlled ascent and descent of the Yuan, which these capital controls allow for, gets China labeled a currency manipulator. Still, it remains a central part of its economic policy as its exports can remain competitively priced in global markets.  Allowing a trader to purchase shares of a crypto ETF in Yuan via a local brokerage account, and then sell it for crypto, would create a very effective means of bypassing capital controls. Stablecoins already provide a very effective gray market for this, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in China that need dollar liquidity to pay their international supply chain.  Remember, that there's no outright ban on crypto in China, only one on exchanges and using local payment rails for crypto transactions. Binance and OKX openly advertise USDT-Yuan markets on their peer-to-peer platforms facilitated by WeChat Pay.  However, the liquidity offered in these markets is small, and most max out at 10-12,000 RMB ($1400-$1600), which is why it's tolerated.  The ability to do this via brokerage accounts would institutionalize the capital flight, adding a significant number of zeros behind the amounts being converted to crypto to leave the country.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/13/no-hong-kongs-crypto-etfs-arent-available-in-mainland-china,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/366e2fd0b229bc7c378fa6fd24e6ca7120e89baf-4896x3264.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Users interpreted the post as a sign to focus on certain stocks.  Gill’s cult following contributed to the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021. GME rose over 44% in GME pre-market trading, while AMC Entertainment Holdings jumped as much as 12%  A single picture on Monday sparked rallies across some cat-themed meme coins and Gamestop stock (NYSE: GME) as market cults heralded the apparent return of TheRoaringKitty, the X profile of retail trader Keith Gill, who made his first post since late 2021.  Gill posted a meme that refers to a period of “locking in,” a colloquial term for a period of intense focus or concentration. Users on X and Reddit largely seemed to consider the image as a sign to lock into trading markets.  Stocks related to Gill and other “meme stocks,” surged. GME prices were up as high as 44% in pre-market trading, and surged as high as 100% on market open before trading was halted. Cinema chain AMC Entertainment Holdings (NYSE: AMC) was up 12% in pre-market, rising to as much as 30% after open.  An unaffiliated GameStop meme coin on the Solana blockchain surged more than 550%, DEXTools data shows, while an AMC token jumped 1,200%. Some microcap cat-themed meme coins such as kitty (KITTY) rose thousands of percent, while larger tokens popcat (POPCAT) and mog (MOG) rose over 15%. Larger-cap meme coins {{DOGE}} and {{SHIB}} were higher by 5% and 7%, respectively.  Data shows that opportunistic developers issued a slew of tokens referring to Gill, TheRoaringKitty, GameStop, and “stonks” – a meme term for stocks—in the past 24 hours.  Who is Roaring Kitty?  Gill’s analysis of the video game retailer GameStop on Reddit, starting in 2019 and gaining traction during the COVID pandemic, created a viral phenomenon at the time. It was largely cited as a driving factor in the GameStop short squeeze of January 2021 as several small-time traders banded together and purchased options and leveraged shares of the company.  The stock rose from $4 to over $120 in a month and, at its peak, was up thousands of percent from its lifetime low of 64 cents in April 2020.  Gill’s initial $53,000 investment was worth nearly $50 million at its peak, emerging as a rags-to-riches story of a lone trader making a fortune from his bedroom by betting against hedge funds.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Bitcoin (BTC) rose during the European morning on Monday, peaking at around $63,200, before retreating below $62,800. BTC may be again trying to rally above $64,000, of which there have been numerous instances this month, all of which have been sold off. This behavior, along with transaction numbers plummeting, points toward a consolidation in the market and the possibility of bitcoin being range-bound for the time being. At the time of writing, bitcoin is 2.34% higher in the last 24 hours at $62,543. The CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), which measures the broader digital market, has added 1.1%, with the likes of ETH and SOL showing more modest gains, trading just below $3,000 and $150 respectively.  Bitcoin's price action since it attained new all-time highs in March has been characterized by lower lows and lower highs as a shift toward selling has taken hold in the market thanks to long- and short-term holders alike being in profit. “A failure below $60K could trigger something of a panic sell-off,"" FxPro trader Alex Kuptsikevich told CoinDesk in a note. ""The positive scenario, in our opinion, will become the main one with a rise above $65K, fixing the price at the 50-day moving average and the reversal area in early May."" He added that downward pressure is likely related to asset sell-offs by miners and concerns over tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies.  Japanese investment and consulting firm Metaplanet has adopted bitcoin as a reserve asset to hedge against the country's debt burden and yen volatility. Metaplanet has acquired 117.7 BTC ($7.35 million) since April, imitating the strategy of MicroStrategy in the U.S. The ratio between Japan's gross debt and GDP currently exceeds 254%, the highest in the advanced world, according to data tracked by the IMF. For comparison, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio has exceeded 123%. The yen has depreciated by 50% against the U.S. dollar since early 2021. ""As the yen continues to weaken, Bitcoin offers a non-sovereign store of value that has, and may continue, to appreciate against traditional fiat currencies,"" Metaplanet said.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the percentage change in the U.S. M2 from a year ago.  M2 measures the money supply, including cash, checking deposits and other deposits readily convertible to cash.  The M2 growth rate flipped positive in April, a positive sign for risk assets.  ""Simple rule ... liquidity leads risk assets,"" James Thorne, chief market strategist at Wellington-Altus Private Wealth, said.

42418248,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1Tx,1715601464,Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Slumped Last Week in Biggest Decline Since Crypto Winter: Bernstein,"Bitcoin mining difficulty fell about 6% last week, the report said.  The broker noted that bitcoin miners with the lowest costs have increased market share since the halving.  Bernstein said a pause in the bitcoin rally is good for lower cost miners as hashrates remain capped.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} mining difficulty fell around 6% last week in the most significant decline since the crypto winter of December 2022, and this is a positive development for some of the miners, broker Bernstein said in a research report on Monday.  The broker noted that with lower bitcoin prices and an almost doubling of costs since the halving, higher cost mining equipment has shut down, resulting in a drop in hashrate.  “With the decrease in hashrate, market share of our 3 covered miners has gone up after halving by almost 20 basis points (bps),” analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra wrote, adding that “we expect the top 3 listed bitcoin miners to continue to consolidate market share via organic and M&A led expansion.”  Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power that is being used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain.  The leading bitcoin miners, Riot Platforms (RIOT) and CleanSpark (CLSK), have the lowest cost of production with strong balance sheets and cash positions, the report said.  “A temporary pause in bitcoin price is actually good for the incumbent lower cost bitcoin miners, as hashrates remain capped and strong miners can execute on their aggressive capex and M&A plans to grow market share,” the authors wrote.  “And finally, when bitcoin price momentum picks up, miners can harvest high dollar revenues over higher production,” the report added.  The broker doesn’t predict a major drawdown in the bitcoin price, expecting the cryptocurrency to remain range-bound and to break out to the upside once spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) see allocations from registered investment advisors (RIAs), wealth platforms and other institutional funds.  Bernstein has an outperform rating on CleanSpark and Riot Platforms and a market-perform rating on Marathon Digital (MARA).

27729003,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607716,1715599836,"Analyst Points Out Level To Beat If Bitcoin Is To Reach $76,000","Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has highlighted what needs to happen for Bitcoin to climb to $76,000. If that doesn’t happen, he noted that the flagship crypto risks dropping significantly to levels not seen since the start of the year. How Bitcoin Could Rise To $76,000 Martinez mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) post that Bitcoin will likely rise to $76,610 if it can reclaim $64,290 as support. However, if it fails to climb above $64,290, the crypto analyst added that Bitcoin might retest support at $51,970. Martinez drew this conclusion based on MVRV (Market Value To Realized Value) extreme deviation pricing bands, which showed $51,970 as the all-time mean. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1? Bitcoin has recently maintained a tepid price movement and isn’t showing any sign that it can reclaim $64,290 as support for now. Instead, the flagship crypto looks likelier to retest the $51,970 price level, seeing as it is looking to break down below $60,000. However, despite Bitcoin looking to have a bearish outlook, crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto maintains that Bitcoin’s price action is bearish. In an X (formerly Twitter) post, he mentioned that BTC is having a “simple retest to weary the impatient trader.” “Nothing bearish as bears seem to amplify it,” he added. The analyst had previously predicted that Bitcoin could climb to $73,000 once it clears the $67,000 price level. BTC May Soon Resume Its Upward Trajectory Meanwhile, crypto analyst Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin may soon be out of the clear, revealing that the Post-halving “Danger Zone” officially ends on May 13. The analyst had previously explained that this Danger Zone is the downside wick that Bitcoin experienced approximately 21 days after the Halving in 2016. In another X post, the analyst revealed that Bitcoin had repeated the “2016 history perfectly, offering a downside wick below the bottom of its current Re-Accumulation range within a three-week window after the halving.” Therefore, with this retracement out of the way, the flagship crypto looks primed for an upward trend. Related Reading: Cardano Ready For 15x Move, Crypto Analyst Reveals The Major Drivers However, this move might not happen so soon since Rekt Capital mentioned the Reaccumulation period, which usually occurs after the Bitcoin halving. The crypto analyst noted that this period usually lasts up to five months. He added that this time could be different since this re-accumulation would develop around a new all-time high (ATH) area. While it is uncertain when this price rally might come, Rekt Capital suggested that Bitcoin might not drop below the $60,000 price level again. He claimed that a weekly close above $60,600 for Bitcoin “would continue to solidify this price level as a base of the Re-Accumulation Range. At the time of writing, BTC is trading at around $61,100, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

After periods when 94% of both long—and short-term holders were in profit, there has been a shift towards selling, leading to significant drawdowns in the following four to six months. The current cycle could follow a similar pattern if institutional demand and macroeconomic conditions weaken.  Bitcoin {{BTC}} could see a panic sell-off if it closes under the $60,000 level in the coming days, according to FxPro trader Alex Kuptsikevich. Crypto traders are targeting a break above $65,000 before sentiment can be deemed bullish.  BTC briefly jumped to over $63,000 in European morning hours on Monday, jolting alternative and major tokens. Ether (ETH), Solana’s SOL and dogecoin (DOGE) 3% in the past 24 hours, with most gains coming after BTC’s rise.  TON, the token of the Tonchain blockchain closely related to the messaging service Telegram, rose 7%, leading the jump among majors.  The CoinDesk 20 (CD20), a broad-based liquid index of the biggest tokens minus stablecoins, was up 2.24%.  BTC has largely remained range-bound between $60,000 and $70,000 since March, with the highly-anticipated halving event in April turning out to be a sell-the-news play amid a general lack of market catalysts. Inflows from exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have waned in the past few weeks, as reported, adding to a bearish sentiment.  Alex Kuptsikevich said in a Monday note to CoinDesk that price action has been characterized by a sequence of lower lows and lower highs, marking a sign of investors selling into strength on price rallies.  “There is pressure likely related to asset sell-offs by miners and fears of tighter regulation of cryptocurrencies,” Kuptsikevich said, referring to the drop in mining difficulty after April’s halving.  “A failure below $60K could trigger something of a panic sell-off. The positive scenario, in our opinion, will become the main one with a rise above $65K, fixing the price at the 50-day moving average and the reversal area in early May,” he added.  Mining difficulty measures how difficult it is for miners to solve mathematical puzzles that accept and confirm transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain. The increase in resources required to solve these puzzles strains miners' businesses, making them unprofitable and resulting in fewer miners.  Short-term holders may influence drawdowns  Elsewhere, analysts at crypto investment firm Ryze Labs said in a weekly note that the behavior of short-term bitcoin holders—or those who hold the tokens for less than 155 days—could largely influence markets in the coming months.  Ryze Labs said there have been three instances in which 94% of both long—and short-term Bitcoin holders were in profit: from mid-November 2017 to mid-April 2017, mid-February to mid-April 2021, and most recently, from the end of February 2024 to the beginning of April.  The peak values of Bitcoin held by short-term investors were $117.8 billion in 2017 and $289.9 billion in 2021. During these times, long-term holders and miners sold Bitcoin to short-term holders, who held it for less than 155 days.  However, following these peaks, short-term holder losses increased rapidly, leading to a cycle inversion in which short-term sellers sold to long-term holders. The team observed that this shift has historically resulted in significant bitcoin price drawdowns in the following four to six months.  “In the most recent cycle, short-term holders had Bitcoin valued at $218.9 billion. While most were initially in profit, they started to sell actively. About one month after this period, the maximum price drawdown from the period's high is approximately -6%,” the analysts said.  “The current cycle may differ from previous ones due to institutional demand supported by improving macroeconomic conditions. However, if these supportive factors weaken, a Bitcoin price drawdown similar to past cycles could occur,” they added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/13/bitcoin-below-60k-could-trigger-panic-selling-crypto-analyst-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6cc3531d6c71139681babbdc23959950c5081984-5045x2838.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42418267,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcTd1kT,1715597337,Stablecoin Expansion Stalls Ahead of U.S. Inflation Data,"The expansion of the top three stablecoins, USDT, USDC and DAI, a powder keg used to fund token purchases, has stalled since the bitcoin halving.  A potential soft U.S. CPI print on Wednesday may revive inflows into the market.  China's plan to step up fiscal support to the economy may bode well for risk assets.  The expansion of stablecoins, or the dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies, which played a crucial role in the crypto bull market of the first quarter, has halted since the Bitcoin blockchain implemented the supposedly bullish mining reward halving on April 20.  The combined market value of the top three stablecoins, namely tether (USDT), USDC, and DAI (DAI), which dominate the stablecoin market with a share of over 90%, has been fluctuating between $149 billion and $150 billion for the past three weeks.  The consolidation comes after several weeks of an uptrend and may have bearish implications for the market, according to 10x Research.  ""Since the halving, we have seen nearly zero growth in stablecoin inflows, and bitcoin futures leverage has been dramatically reduced. Contrary to the bullish tweets about a post-halving rally, crypto users have voted with their money by withdrawing or pausing inflows,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research, said in a note to clients Monday.  Thielen added that bitcoin {{BTC}} could correct to $55,000 or lower in the coming weeks, and ether {{ETH}}, the world's second-largest token, could drop to $2,500.  Traders widely used stablecoins to fund cryptocurrency purchases and derivatives trading. Hence, the expansion of their supplies is said to represent an increase in inflows into the market, a bullish development, and vice versa.  The combined market cap of the three stablecoins increased over 23% to nearly $149 billion in four months leading up to the halving. Market leader bitcoin's price rose by over 50% to $65,000 during that time, with the total crypto market capitalization increasing by 50% to $3.2 trillion.  The stall in stablecoin expansion coincides with a marked slowdown in inflows into the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  The chart by Coinglass shows daily flows into the ETFs have slowed notably in the weeks on either side of the fourth halving, taking the wind out of the bitcoin bull run. Since halving, the cryptocurrency has largely traded lackluster between $60,000 and $65,000.  U.S. CPI and China stimulus may offer support  Some observers expect a potential softer-than-expected U.S. consumer price index (CPI) print on Wednesday to lift bitcoin above $65,000.  ""Wednesday’s CPI will be key to see if we can break above the $65,000 and make progress back towards the year highs, in line with equities. The lack of leverage suggests the market is under positioned for a move higher and has been forced to chase this bounce this morning,"" the founders of newsletter service LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk.  According to Bloomberg, the consensus is for the data to show the cost of living likely increased 3.4% over the year in April, a moderation from March's 3.5%. The core CPI, which strips out the volatile food and energy component, rose 3.6% year-on-year, down from March's 3.8%.  A renewed slowdown in inflation will likely raise hopes for Fed rate cuts this year, spurring inflows into risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.  China's plans to inject liquidity into the system could help as well. According to Bloomberg, the world's second-largest economy aims to sell one trillion yuan of debt through December, the fourth such issuance in the past 26 years.  ""Bitcoin bounced to $63,000 early today probably because China is about to flood the market with liquidity in a ""QE with Chinese characteristics,"" the founders at the LondonCryptoClub said.  ""This morning, China fired the starting gun to issue RMB 1trn ($140bn) in long-dated bonds to help stimulate the economy. The PBOC has also hinted under instruction from Xi that they will purchase these bonds in the secondary market. China is about to inject a wave of liquidity into markets,"" the founders added.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/05/13/stablecoin-expansion-stalls-ahead-of-us-inflation-data,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8858d0cac12cc13fd36e66cafeeb763ec6246aaf-2710x1214.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The Singapore-headquartered company is now functioning with regulators' blessings in the Middle East and India as well as its home base.  Liminal, a Singapore-headquartered provider of custody services, won regulatory approval in Abu Dhabi as its expansion outside its home base takes another step forward, its representatives told CoinDesk in an interview Monday.  The firm's First Answer Middle East subsidiary received the Financial Services Permission (FSP) from the Abu Dhabi Global Market's (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) on Thursday, allowing it to provide custody in the region. It was granted in-principal approval last year.  In the past few weeks, Liminal has seen a series of regulatory positives in the Asian Pacific (APAC) and Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Late last month, its Dubai entity, First Answer Custody FZE, secured initial approval from the emirate's Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (VARA). Liminal's Indian subsidy, First Answer India Technologies, is also registered as a reporting entity.  ""We initiated a strategic drive two years ago to secure regulatory licenses in key markets across APAC and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa), strategically positioning ourselves to cater to institutional clients,"" said Manan Vora, senior vice president of strategy and business operations. ""Our strategic vision is to expand from our present technology presence in Europe and Taiwan to pushing for regulatory victories there. In Indonesia, we are already working as a technology provider for the nation's sovereign digital asset exchange.""  Last week, an official of India's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) told CoinDesk that Liminal's unit in the country had been registered as a reporting entity. That makes it the first digital asset custodian registered with the FIU, company representatives said. In November, the nation's premier investigating police agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), appointed Liminal to manage seized digital assets.  Liminal has also been active at home. When Singapore introduced new licensing requirements for custody solutions providers in April, Liminal was already providing custody solutions and was thus grandfathered into the new guidelines. That arrangement lasts for six months. Liminal has notified the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) that it has begun the process of applying for a license.

The price is trading below the $0.1450 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1430 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price must settle above $0.1450 to move into a positive zone and start a fresh surge. Dogecoin Price Extends Losses After a close below $0.150, Dogecoin price extended losses and moved into a short-term bearish zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a drop below the $0.1450 support zone. A low was formed at $0.1358 and DOGE is attempting a recovery wave. There was a minor increase above the $0.1420 resistance level. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1538 swing high to the $0.1358 low. Dogecoin is still below the $0.1450 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.1430 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.1430 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The next major resistance is near the $0.1450 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). It coincides with the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1538 swing high to the $0.1358 low. Source: DOGEUSD on TradingView.com A close above the $0.1450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1535 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1620 level. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.1450 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.140 level. The next major support is near the $0.1360 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.1360 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1200 level.

27724992,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=607681,1715587839,XRP To Hit Zero Against BTC? Veteran Trader Cites ‘Pure Classical Charting’,"In a recent analysis shared via X, Peter Brandt, regarded as one of the leading experts globally in applying classical charting techniques to trading futures, foreign exchange, and crypto markets, suggested that the XRP to Bitcoin (XRP/BTC) exchange rate could potentially hit zero. Brandt’s analysis applies traditional techniques inspired by pioneers such as Schabacker, Edwards, and Magee to forecast this drastic trend. Brandt stated, “From a pure classical charting point of view (that is, Schabacker, Edwards, Magee) this chart looks like it is headed toward Zero. XRPBTC” Why Brandt Thinks XRP Is Going To Zero Vs. BTC The chart indicates a troubling trajectory for XRP when priced in Bitcoin, with key support levels being consistently tested over time. The weekly chart showcases a series of peaks and troughs with notable highs in 2017 and a sharp decline from 2018 onwards. Related Reading: XRP On A Sinking Ship? Why Altcoin’s Price Continues To Plunge Recently, the XRP/BTC ratio has been hovering around a crucial support line, illustrated by a dashed horizontal line on the chart. Notably, the chart shows XRP/BTC experiencing significant volatility over the years. After reaching highs in 2017 at 0.00025 BTC, it has been on a general downtrend, especially notable after September 2018. “XRPPBTC has lost 70% of its value since the Nov 2017 post,” Brandt commented. A critical historical support level for the digital asset is highlighted by Brandt at around 0.000007 BTC (black line), which the market is currently testing. The continuation of the bearish trend might break this support. Moreover, two moving averages are depicted on the chart. The 8-week SMA (Simple Moving Average) is currently at 0.00000838 BTC, while the 18-week SMA stands at 0.00000990 BTC, indicating bearish momentum as the price is below both averages. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Can Break Out From Falling Pennant, But Can It Reach $1? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the chart, with a 14-week period, is at 28.80, which is near the oversold territory. This might usually suggest a potential for price recovery, yet the persistent bearish sentiment depicted suggests caution. Peter Brandt’s assertion that the XRP/BTC ratio could be “headed toward Zero” comes from observing the continued failure of the price to rebound from key support levels and the downtrend remaining intact without signs of reversal. His commentary reflects a stark outlook for XRP when compared against Bitcoin, emphasizing the importance of these technical levels in predicting future movements. In a follow-up post on X, Brandt doubled down on this claim, stating, “It is actually fun poking a stick at XRP_aholics. My comparison is to BTC, not USD, so here is what I don’t understand. How can XRP bulls be so insistent in that XRP is near ATLs vs BTC, and, in fact, has only closed higher than present levels in 6 of the last 126 months?” At press time, XRP traded at $0.49845.

At over 250%, Japan's debt-to-GDP ratio is the highest among advanced countries, according to the IMF.  Tokyo-listed Metaplanet has adopted bitcoin {{BTC}} as a strategic reserve asset as a hedge against Japan's debt burden and the resulting volatility in the yen.  ""Metaplanet has adopted bitcoin as its strategic reserve asset. The move is a direct response to sustained economic pressures in Japan, notably high government debt levels, prolonged periods of negative real interest rates, and the consequently weak yen,"" the company said in the press release on Monday.  Since April, Metaplanet has acquired 117.7 BTC ($7.19 million), following the strategy pursued by U.S.-listed MicroStrategy (MSTR), which has acquired several billion dollars worth of bitcoin, per Bitcointreasuries.net. Metaplanet, an early-stage investment firm, has moved away from any involvement in Web3 and is now only focused on bitcoin alongside exposure to commercial real estate.  The move stands out because it comes at a time when Japan's fiscal crisis is said to be playing out in the currency market. Crypto propounders have long hailed bitcoin as a hedge against fiscal and monetary imprudence.  The ratio between Japan's gross debt and gross domestic product (GDP) currently exceeds 254%, the highest in the advanced world, according to data tracked by the International Monetary Fund. The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio has exceeded 123%.  The relatively higher debt has kept the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from raising interest rates in lockstep with the Federal Reserve (Fed) and other major central banks. Higher interest rates raise the cost of servicing debt, further complicating the fiscal issues.  While the Fed has lifted rates above 5% since early 2022, the benchmark borrowing cost in Japan remains near zero. As such, the yen, one of the top five global reserve currencies, has depreciated sharply. Interest rate differentials heavily impact fiat currency exchange rates.  Data from the charting platform TradingView show that the Japanese yen has depreciated by 50% against the U.S. dollar since early 2021. The yen recently slipped past 155 per U.S. dollar, reaching a 34-year low. The sell-off reportedly saw BOJ sell dollars to put a floor under the yen in a classic currency market intervention.  ""As the yen continues to weaken, Bitcoin offers a non-sovereign store of value that has, and may continue, to appreciate against traditional fiat currencies,"" Metaplanet said, adding that BOJ's strategy of keeping rates low while intervening in the FX markets represents an ""unsustainable monetary paradox.""  The company plans to hold bitcoin for the long term to ensure minimally realized taxable gains and to acquire more bitcoin by issuing long-dated yen liabilities when the opportunity arises.
