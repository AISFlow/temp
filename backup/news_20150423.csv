42426338,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMblh,1429826124,Bitcoin Exchange ItBit Seeks Bank License With Ex-FDIC Chair,"UPDATE (24th April 20:35 BST): This piece has been updated with additional information regarding itBit’s application filing.      ItBit  has filed an application for a state banking license in New York.  In statements to CoinDesk, New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) spokesman Matthew Anderson confirmed the filing.  ItBit may be approved within the next few weeks, according to a report by Reuters, citing individuals with knowledge of the process.  Notably, the banking license application reportedly names several well-known political and financial figures in the US, including former Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC) chair Sheila Bair and former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley.  According to filing notices published by the NYDFS, itBit began the process of acquiring a state banking license in early February.  Bair served as chairperson for the FDIC under President George W Bush, the federal agency that oversees deposit accounts and deposit insurance coverage guidelines.  Bair and Bradley, along with ItBit CEO Charles Cascarilla, Liberty City Ventures founding partner Emil Woods and former Financial Accounting Standards Board director Robert Herz, are said to be listed as organizers on the state banking license application.  A spokesperson for itBit told CoinDesk that the company does not comment ""on rumors [or] speculation"". Further, she stated that ItBit did not confirm to Reuters that it had filed for a banking license.

42426341,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbvh,1429824793,Barclays Data Officer Praises Blockchain Tech at SWIFT Forum,"Blockchain technology is “transformative”, according to Usama Fayyad, chief data officer at Barclays.  Speaking at SWIFT Business Forum London, Fayyad explained that he believes bitcoin is interesting, but argued that it may not remain the most compelling use case in the future.  “Underneath [bitcoin] lies the technology of the blockchain and I think that will be transformative,” he added.  Fayyad took part in a panel discussion titled Harnessing disruptive technology in wholesale financial services, which featured Craig Donaldson, CEO of Metro Bank; Gottfried Leibbrandt, CEO of SWIFT; Christophe Chazot, group head of innovation at HSBC; and Daniel Marovitz, president of Earthport’s European division.  Fayyad expressed interest in the idea of a distributed and secure ledger that can facilitate the exchange of contracts and information while providing the equivalent to a digital signature. He believes the integration of such technology with traditional banking infrastructure “will happen”.  Building bridges  Marovitz echoed Fayyad’s views and explained that Earthport, which provides white-label cross-border payments services to banks, is working to figure out how exactly the distributed ledger concept can be used to improve his company’s operations.  Earthport is already working with Ripple Labs to use its distributed consensus protocol for cross-border payments.  He added:  “I think it is a very big deal and very serious and it will have transformative effects – exactly how and exactly when, I think we’re all wrestling with.”  Marovitz suggested that the main issue is finding a way to merge the compliance processes that exist in traditional banking infrastructure with this new technology.  “When we’ve built those those bridges, I think incredible things will happen,” he said.  Marovitz went on to state that the blockchain is a “major source of interest for us and major location of [our] investment and energy”.  Donaldson, CEO of Metro Bank, said he has talked with bitcoin companies and agrees with Marovitz that the current struggle seems to be fitting this new technology with the current expectations surrounding financial compliance rules.  “I think the technology is massively interesting, [but] the ability for those organisations to flourish is somewhat hampered at the moment and will continue to be,” he added.  Part of the puzzle  HSBC innovation chief Chazot stressed that, while the blockchain could indeed be useful within the traditional banking sphere, it is merely one part of the concept of a distributed database.  He suggested there are plenty of other technologies that are worth exploring, and that blockchain technology may be useful for some applications, but not for everything.  “The danger is people ... will try to apply blockchain [technology] to everything, [but] you can’t apply one solution to everything,” he concluded.  Chazot’s views mirror those of Mariano Belinky, managing director at Santander InnoVentures, who said in an interview that he doesn’t believe bitcoin is capable of eliminating all industry problems.  ""Think of bitcoin as a hammer. If you are going to have people walking around with hammers to treat everything as a nail, that's a problem because you are going to break a lot of things,” he told CoinDesk.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Emily Spaven,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/23/barclays-data-officer-praises-blockchain-tech-at-swift-forum,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9bf0f6de447946aa4e4ca3741ba6599ef4f73ddf-1500x1070.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426333,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbfh,1429821359,Lamassu Plans Added Cost for Bitcoin ATM Operators,"Lamassu has announced it will begin charging monthly subscription fees to pay for tech support and software upgrades.  While the service is not mandatory, Lamassu said that it will no longer offer free support to customers after the start date.  The actual fees required depend on the number of machines owned by an operator. For those who own between one and four machines, the monthly cost will be $100 per unit while charges for those who own between five and nine machines will be $90 per unit. Operators who run more than 10 ATMs will pay $80 per unit.  In interview, Lamassu CEO and co-founder Zach Harvey characterized the existing support framework as unsustainable, indicating that such a move has been in the works for some time.  Harvey told CoinDesk:  “Up until this point, we were just giving out support for free, and it’s something that’s just not sustainable. We can’t give full support for free, and it was something that was never included in the price of the machine.”  Harvey stressed that the company did not want to pursue an approach by which a percentage of transaction fees or profits would be taken out for support. According to the company, operators will still be able to access the Lamassu support desk for information, and that existing warranties will remain in place.  The move follows an operational shift at the company, during which time Lamassu reduced the size of its team and cut travel and conference expenses. The changes, according to Harvey, took place last year and were necessary in order to eliminate what had become consistent cash flow problems.  Shift to paid support model  An email sent to operators outlined the parameters of the support subscription plan, stating that a formal service level agreement will be put in place when the service goes live in June.  Harvey explained that operators will have the option to pay the fees in bitcoin, but said that the Lamassu team is still developing how that will work operationally.  He told CoinDesk that Lamassu had been looking to begin charging for technical support for some time, but held off as the ATM software was being developed and improved upon. The company, he said, was also establishing how much its support services would cost it in the long-term.  “It was just a matter of when we thought we could implement it, and we’re at the point now where we have a pretty good idea of what the support entails, and a good idea of what it will cost,” he said.  Mixed response  Harvey suggested that operator sentiment toward the support fee structure was divided, with larger-scale operators generally in favor of the change while less business-focused operators are “not as happy about it”.  “It’s kind of what we expected,” Harvey said of the response.  He added that resources will still be available for operators that opt out of the support subscription.  However, he stated that “there’s no way we can offer free lifetime support for everyone” owing to the long-term costs, adding that he does not believe Lamassu had previously committed to doing so.  Tightening the belt  According to Harvey, Lamassu previously moved to reduce its internal headcount last year, which included firing several freelancers that were working for the company.  When asked why the company decided to consolidate, Harvey said that the company was seeing month-over-month losses, explaining:  ""We were spending more money than was coming in. Which is fine for a short period of time, but when it happened for four-to-five months we had to pull back before it ate up our prior profits.""  Since then, he explained, the company has seen improving financials as of the last quarter of 2014.  ""We all work harder now, but we're also a healthier business,"" he added.

42426349,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMc9h,1429813811,FinTech's Slow Embrace of Bitcoin on Display at Draper University Event,"Held on 20th April at Draper University's San Mateo headquarters, the FinTech Connection Forum succeeded at illustrating how bitcoin may be best considered a niche subject of curiosity in the wider financial world.  Featuring speakers as diverse as Citi Ventures' Arvind Purushotham and CBW Bank's Suresh Ramamurthi, the FinTech Connection provided a day-long forum for discussions on the broader opportunity that could be unlocked by disrupting the financial industry, noting at times how bitcoin and blockchain technology could play a part in this societal shift.  Perhaps the most enthusiastic about the technology was Tim Draper himself, who participates in the industry as one of its most active evangelists and investors, having invested in more than 20 companies and purchased nearly 30,000 BTC at auction.  In his opening speech, Draper was effusive in his praise for bitcoin the digital currency as well as its underlying distributed ledger, the blockchain, noting the ability to change how money moves and contracts are formed.  Draper told the audience:  ""There are some laggard industries that are really big and one of them is finance. Finance could easily be as transformed as the music industry when Napster came. I think it's these companies and others that are going to make that happen.""  Draper went on to inform the audience he had recently completed six all-bitcoin funding rounds for startups including BlinkTrade, ChainPerks, MeGO, Leetcoin, Plus Go and SFX.io.  ""We funded each one with bitcoin or stock and that transaction is going into the blockchain,"" he added.  Elsewhere, the subject of cryptocurrency appeared, albeit briefly, in talks given by Foundation Capital general partner Charles Moldow and CBW's Ramamurthi.  Bitcoin tsunami  The task of presenting a more concentrated conversation on the challenges and opportunities in the digital currency industry fell to Boost VC CEO Adam Draper, BlockCypher CEO Catheryne Nicholson and Yanni Giannaros, COO of SnapCard.  Together, the group presented a somewhat unorganized overview of developments in the bitcoin industry, sometimes struggling to impart the many intricacies of the nuanced topic to an audience comprised of members perhaps hearing about the subject in detail for the first time.  In the face of the challenge, Draper did his best to keep the subject light, with the former talking about his preference for referring to the coming change in the financial system as one that will amount to a ""bitcoin tsunami"".  ""I'm seeing all the smartest minds I know working on bitcoin companies. All that brain power is going somewhere. I don't know when that hits the surface, and I don't know when that hits, but it will be an explosion,"" he said.  The conversation did successfully identify some of the challenges facing the ecosystem, such as the lack of specific use cases for the technology, the elaborate consensus process by which changes are made to bitcoin's core protocol and its issues competing against traditional payment methods in the developed world.  ""What does bitcoin do better than cash? Sending money across borders, microtransactions, being able to send small amounts of money, and a store of value,"" Draper said. ""You don't want to think about the US.""  In contrast, the panel was more confident of bitcoin's ability to excel for machine-to-machine payments and in the developing world, areas where users may be willing to overcome the interface complexities of today.  ""Explaining TCP/IP is difficult, but showing that you can send a message to anyone in the world is easy,"" Draper concluded.  Communication disconnect  Overall, the panel succeeded at sparking debate, with reactions to its content proving varied.  Entrepreneur in residence at Draper University Ed Kaim suggested that bitcoin still faces a consumer adoption issue, as evidenced by the virtual currency panel, making the case that such an argument helped frame the topic realistically for attendees.  ""Events like this validate the fair points that need to be considered when you're looking to venture into this industry,"" Kaim said. ""I think you have a good perspective on this on what can be done legally and how to face consumers.""  Elsewhere, LibraTax interim CFO Melissa Craig suggested that the event was evidence of how innovators in Silicon Valley are struggling to communicate their message of innovation to the wider financial world.  Craig hinted at a cultural divide between the established financial epicenters on the East Coast and areas like Silicon Valley, a division that is affecting the industry more broadly.  ""Accelerators bring together financial institutions and innovators in financial technology, these two groups are talking past each other. The innovators from Silicon Valley have so much to offer, but banks do have licenses, which startups don't have. They are still trusted holders of people's money,"" she said, adding:  ""They have a couple things going for them that technology and enthusiasm are not going to overcome in the short term.  Middle America's challenge  This need for bitcoin to form an underlying portion of a new financial system was expressed in Ramamurthi's talk, which humorously detailed his personal journey from being an Indian immigrant to purchasing a rural Kansas bank. CBW inked a deal last fall with Ripple Labs to use its distributed payments protocol .  ""Buying a bank is not fun,"" Ramamurthi said, a point he stressed by detailing the government oversight and technological inefficiencies that slowed his progress at bringing the bank into the 21st century.  ""We launched mobile check deposit, none of the customers cared. They wanted to come to the bank and gossip about who ran off with who. Most banks can't get an API, it's not possible,"" he quipped.  The problem with banking, he stressed, is one of plumbing. He suggested that banks need real-time analytics engines based on technology that can scale, a transition in which he expects cryptocurrency to play an integral role.  ""The most basic unit of a smartphone account is a bitcoin wallet,"" he said, pointing to a slide that detailed the ""complex animal"" that banking could become if built on its strong foundation.  While intriguing, Ramamurthi was unfortunately unable to elaborate much on the point, as his talk quickly ended due to time constraints.  Entrepreneurs on the fence  Though Ramamurthi sees promise in blockchain technologies, other FinTech entrepreneurs seemed the most hesitant to embrace bitcoin.  Attendee and software engineer Vincent Phillips reported that he is in the process of launching a FinTech company, but that bitcoin is unlikely to play a role in its development today due to what he perceived as its inability to solve pressing problems.  ""Someday perhaps bitcoin will play a role, but I probably wouldn't spent a lot of time on it. I don't think it could be exploited in the way we need to today, but it's further along than I thought,"" he commented.  Justin Abbott Chalew, CTO of Breeze, a startup creating an RFID payments solution for gas purchases, echoed similar concerns. Though he reported being interested in seeing developments, he said that it's unlikely consumers would pay for gas with bitcoin.  ""The argument is for the rails, but on my side, consumers buy gas and consumers are paying for it. They have credit cards, checking accounts, there's no way we could accept bitcoin,"" he said, adding that Breeze uses ACH payments to keep its costs low.  Paul Spiller, COO at investment app Acorns, called bitcoin ""as interesting and intriguing as it was a year ago"".  Spiller went on to note the difficulty he saw in explaining what he believes is a solution for the developing world to an audience of FinTech VCs, stating:  ""If you're in a room full of VCs here, it's not top of mind, it's not solving a pain point they have.""

42426370,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbph,1429796024,Santander InnoVentures Chief on Blockchain Tech's 'Bigger Picture',"Financial innovation is the topic of the hour, so it is hardly surprising that banks are being increasingly judged on their capability – and willingness – to implement change.      Mariano Belinky, managing director at Santander InnoVentures, the megabank's venture capital fund, is familiar with this desire to innovate from within.      But what about innovations, like bitcoin, that take place beyond bank walls? Speaking on a panel at Finextra's FutureMoney conference, Belinky described how his industry could be ""transformed"" by distributed ledgers like the blockchain.    The bigger picture    Speaking to CoinDesk, the VC expanded on his perceptions of cryptocurrency technology and why, in his opinion, consumer adoption doesn't matter just yet.      Though some in the bitcoin space may be watching the currency's growing transaction volume impatiently, Belinky warned against measuring bitcoin's worth solely on its popularity as a currency.      ""We shouldn't be focused on the adoption of a digital currency. The underlying technology is a powerful one and I think that we will see adoption of that technology much sooner.""            It's about looking at the bigger picture, Belinky added. For him, it's important to explore blockchains and competing technologies to find real-world applications.  ""If some of those applications require bitcoin, I am sure that we will end up using bitcoin. But we are not going to use bitcoin for the sake of doing so,"" he said  Despite his initial enthusiasm, Belinky also echoed a sentiment now common across traditional financial institutions. That is, bitcoin may have some good applications but it isn't a panacea capable of eliminating all industry problems. In fact, it might be too destructive for its own good.  He noted:    ""Think of bitcoin as a hammer. If you are going to have people walking around with hammers to treat everything as a nail, that's a problem because you are going to break a lot of things.""    Increasing investment in crypto  Santander is not the only Spanish bank exploring the potential of bitcoin and the wider blockchain ecosystem. Madrid-based Bankinter invested in Coinffeine, a Spanish bitcoin exchange, in November last year.  At the time, the bank said its investment, made through the Bankinter Innovation Foundation, was one of the first in the bitcoin space.  Belinky's comments also come amid additional interest and investment from other corporations outside the crypto sector.  Orange Silicon Valley, the San Francisco division of the telecommunications giant announced plans to invest up to $20,000 in blockchain startups earlier this month.  Solutions for real problems  According to its website, Santander's $100m fund, headed by Belinky, is an attempt to get closer to the ""wave of disruptive innovation in the FinTech space"".  The initiative, which provides funding and mentoring, currently has two mobile payments and one software startup in its portfolio.  When asked what it would take for Santander to support a crypto startup, Belinky said:    ""It would take us identifying a crypto startup that solves a real problem for our customers. We don't have very many customers that are trying to figure out a way to hold their bitcoin.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Yessi Bello Perez,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/04/23/santander-innoventures-chief-on-blockchain-techs-bigger-picture,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8a1d70b0e12004052fdefe6a6f42b51e1f74f190-1496x937.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42426335,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJMbhh,1429789420,Spanish Bitcoin Community Celebrates Bitcoin's VAT Exemption,"Spain's bitcoin community is celebrating following confirmation that the cryptocurrency is exempt from Value Added Tax (VAT) in the country.  Bitcoin had always been exempt from VAT, but a spokesperson from Spain's tax office, Ministerio de Hacienda, told CoinDesk the decision had been clarified following a question from a bitcoin aficionado.  The confirmation is based on the interpretation of EU VAT Directive 2006/112/CE, which recognises bitcoin as ""financial service"".  Both bitcoin startups and legal experts in Spain are praising the administration's decision, which provides clarity in an otherwise uncertain regulatory climate.  Pablo Fernández Burgueño, an expert in e-commerce law and the co-founder of Abanlex, said the exemption seemed ""logical"". He told CoinDesk:  ""Bitcoin is mostly being used as a speculative tool, only a minority are using it as a payment form, because of this the tax office would find it impossible to levy VAT for every bitcoin transaction.""  Daniel Diez, business development manager at bitcoin-to-cash service Bit2Me, added that bitcoin startups would now be able to plan their financial strategy more effectively. He said:  ""It is great news for [bitcoin] companies because previously, the legal uncertainty around the subject was very high and it could lead to financial planning errors. We hope to see institutions giving more positive [bitcoin related] news that facilitates bitcoin's adoption.""  With Spanish banks BBVA and Bankinter now investing in bitcoin companies, Alberto Gómez Toribio, CEO and co-founder of Coinffeine, said the country was ""one of the best places in the world"" for crypto-entrepreneurs.  Like others, he praised the Spanish government's ability to understand the challenges being faced by companies in the bitcoin space.  ""The country's public institutions are aware that in order to stimulate the bitcoin sector, flexibility and being open to discussion with experts in the field is important. They [public institutions] are doing a very good job.""  Ramifications of the exemption  According to Fernández, startups can now create business plans with more transparency, fully aware of what kind of taxes they are expected to pay, how much profit they can generate and how to trade in bitcoin.  ""The government's decision will actively boost the Spanish bitcoin market,"" he added.  The lawyer also noted other ramifications of the long-awaited confirmation.  As Spanish citizens are subject to Spanish law, those purchasing the digital currency from companies in Poland or Estonia – the latter levies a 20% tax on those trading bitcoins as a service and the former imposed a 23% VAT on bitcoin mining profits – would still be exempt from paying VAT.  ""Those who have previously paid VAT for bitcoin purchases can now refer to Hacienda (the Tax Office) to request a refund,"" Fernández added.  The application of VAT to bitcoin services has proved somewhat of a grey area in the European Union.  Notably, the tax office's definition of bitcoin as a ""financial service, linked to payment methods which enable the transfer of money"" and the assumption that bitcoin transfers are considered to be ""special risk"" activities, means that all Spanish companies operating with the digital currency will have to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules.
