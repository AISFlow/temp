However, an upcoming token unlock event could put an end to the alt coin’s bullish trend given the amount of tokens involved. $21.7 Million In AXS Set To Be Unlock The upcoming Axie Infinity (AXS) token unlock event is the most notable unlock happening this week. Out of the total $27.4 million in tokens set to be unlocked across the space today, AXS unlocks make up the vast majority. Related Reading: Bearish Signal: BNB Open Interest Skyrockets To New Highs According to the token tracking website Token Unlocks, a total of 3.43 million tokens are set to be unlocked in four days on July 22. Going by the current price of AXS tokens at the time of this writing, this translates to $21.55 million in tokens. $21.55 million in AXS tokens set to be unlocked | Source: Token Unlocks This next unlock will see another 2.96% of the total 270 million supply being sent back into circulation. However, unlike its last token unlock held on April 23, the entirety of this token unlock is going toward staking rewards for users of the platform. Will This Affect The Axie Infinity Token Price? The Axie Infinity (AXS) token unlock will no doubt put bearish pressure on the price of the digital asset. This is because the unlock will increase the circulating supply amid declining demand in the market. As such, AXS’s price could see a decline from July 22. However, it is important to note that as these tokens are only going toward staking, they will likely not hit the market at the same time. Such staggered introduction into the market could mitigate selling pressure, giving the buyers time to garner enough demand to offset the new supply. AXS price at $6.24 | Source: AXSUSD on TradingView.com This is possible though as long as the general crypto market does not succumb to the bear pressure current mounting. If Bitcoin is able to recover above $31,000 once more, then coins like AXS will benefit as market sentiment recovers.

The native token of the Ripple payment system was the best performer among the top 25 crypto assets over the last 24 hours, gaining 3.6%. XRP retook its place as the fourth largest digital asset by market value, toppling the embattled exchange giant Binance’s BNB token.  Bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest crypto assets by market capitalization, are now each lower than their levels from last Thursday, both stuck below their psychologically important price levels at $30,000 and $1,900.  Read more: Are Bitcoin Miner Sales Preventing Breakout to Higher Prices?  “The Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit did not generate a broader lasting rally in crypto,” David Lawant, head of research at institutional crypto exchange FalconX.  Though it’s given back some of last Thursday's gains, XRP was still up roughly 60% since the ruling. The CoinDesk Crypto Market Index (CMI), which tracks the performance of the broader digital asset market, meanwhile, gave up all of its Thursday advance, declining 0.5% over the same period.  Top altcoins such as Polygon’s MATIC, Solana’s SOL and Cardano’s ADA, which enjoyed sizable rallies last Thursday, completely reversed to the levels where they traded prior to the XRP ruling. MATIC and SOL are now down 5% over the week, while ADA dropped 2%.  While the rush to purchase XRP could well be mostly behind us, Lawant said, digital asset funds adding the token to their holdings could represent some buying pressure boosting its price.  “Index funds are one potential source of additional institutional flow I’m still watching,” he said.  “XRP has a market capitalization of more than 3.5x of ADA and SOL, typically the largest constituents outside of BTC and ETH, with a weight of little over 1%,” said Lawant. “If XRP is included in the underlying indexes, the asset could represent 4-5% of the composition of the top broad crypto indexes.”",POSITIVE,ADA | BTC | XRP,ADA | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/18/xrps-60-weekly-gain-defies-broader-crypto-slump-as-bitcoin-stalls-below-30k,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/87a579b0062407bb75394b94b81ddd71fffd3f60-2400x1256.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410170,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUF4A,1689712089,"If DeFi Wants to Grow, It Has to Embrace Real-World Assets","With greater than $44 billion in total value locked, there’s no denying decentralized finance (DeFi) has been a big hit among cryptocurrency investors, providing an innovative new way for them to grow their wealth.  The reason for DeFi’s success in crypto is it advantages everyone involved. Crypto holders get a way to earn passive income on their assets through mechanisms such as yield farming, while borrowers can obtain loans in seconds, with advantageous terms no traditional financial institution can match.  DeFi is big in the crypto world. But, if we look at the overall financial industry, it remains a tiny, almost minuscule niche market, albeit one with potential. DeFi is still taking its first baby steps, but, if it’s to stand tall on its own two feet, it desperately needs a way to connect with the traditional financial ecosystem, where it can tap into real businesses and institutional investors.  Enrico Rubboli is the CEO of Mintlayer, a layer 2 solution that allows users to build a decentralized finance ecosystem on the Bitcoin blockchain, opening Bitcoin to DeFi, smart contracts, atomic swaps, NFTs, apps and more.  The issue is that DeFi is plagued by crippling problems that cannot be solved by internal means. One of the biggest restrictions with DeFi is the requirement that borrowers must over-collateralize their loans to account for price volatility. Most DeFi protocols require collateralization above the value of the loan (stablecoin issuer MakerDAO, for example). If someone wants to borrow $1,000, they must put down $1,500. Should the value of that collateral fall below $1,500, they will be hit with a liquidation penalty.  This over-collateralization requirement presents a big risk to borrowers and seriously hinders accessibility. If DeFi is to live up to its promise of making financial services more accessible, it needs to find a way to cater to the millions of businesses globally that struggle to obtain funding elsewhere. At present, most businesses can’t use DeFi as a source of funding, because they’re not allowed to use anything but crypto as collateral.  Also holding back DeFi is the issue of incentivization, which is directly linked to the available liquidity in protocols. When DeFi hit an all-time total value locked (TVL) of $236 billion in November 2021, everyone was happy. Then, along came crypto winter, and by mid-2022 the TVL in DeFi had collapsed to just $40 billion, with the value of most DeFi tokens dropping by 80%-90%. This caused catastrophic damage to DeFi’s incentive system, as lenders are rewarded with yield based on the amount they deposit, paid out in DeFi tokens that were suddenly worth much less.  Fixing DeFi with TradFi  DeFi protocols can become much more relevant by integrating with real-world assets, or tokenized versions of financial instruments such as bonds, equities and debt, and physical assets such as gold, real estate and art. Doing this would introduce more stable assets into DeFi, making users’ investments safer and protocols more accessible.  Tokenization refers to the process of creating digital representations of real-world assets that can be hosted on a public blockchain. This enables assets to be traded transparently and without intermediaries, making transactions faster and more efficient, with lower costs.  DeFi protocols have already proven their worth in the digital asset markets and their efficiency is so compelling that traditional financial institutions are studying their potential. While there is still some opposition to the idea of automated and decentralized asset trading, due to its association with a crypto market that’s often perceived to be lawless and volatile, there’s a growing consensus that traditional finance can no longer ignore the potential benefits blockchain can provide.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - Tokenize Everything: Institutions Bet That Crypto’s Future Lies in the Real World  That explains why we’ve seen several reputable institutions dipping their toes into DeFi. Earlier this year, BlackRock applied to the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) for permission to set up a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Some analysts believe that its application has a good chance of being approved, and it has been followed by a wave of similar applications from the likes of Fidelity, Invesco, Wisdom Tree and Valkyrie, which all applied for their own bitcoin ETFs in June.  Other signs of the growing institutional appetite for DeFi include Banco Santander educating its users about digital assets, and the launch of the EDX Exchange, which is backed by financial powerhouses such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Citadel Securities.  Real-world assets in DeFi  DeFi is an alluring concept for traditional financial institutions because it can be a superior alternative to traditional financial systems. The tokenization of traditional stocks, commodities, government bonds and even things like art and real estate will enable more seamless transactions with far greater transparency than existing mechanisms.  At present, such markets rely on intermediaries such as stock brokers, who invariably take a small cut from any transaction. DeFi eliminates these intermediaries through its use of smart contracts, which are automated, coded agreements that can execute automatically when certain conditions are met. They process transactions faster, with reduced administrative and operational costs, and they’re more transparent as everything is recorded on a publicly viewable blockchain for everybody to see. So they increase trust and accountability in the process too.  Moreover, the DeFi protocols themselves benefit from offering assets with a level of stability that they could previously only dream of. Real-world assets are far stabler than most DeFi tokens, and the reduced volatility will drastically reduce the number of liquidations. Moreover, these real-world assets can be used as an alternative form of collateral, enabling many kinds of businesses to access DeFi for the first time. For instance, businesses could tokenize its outstanding invoices to obtain short-term credit.  By tokenizing real-world assets, investors can also take advantage of services unique to DeFi, such as “staking” and yield farming.  Fractional ownership is another unique benefit that will transform accessibility in existing markets. It will enable assets such as real estate and art to be split among multiple owners. A property or picture represented by tokens becomes divisible, transferable and instantly tradeable across decentralized platforms. In this way, DeFi protocols can be incredibly disruptive, offering greater inclusion.  Though there may be some pushback from hardcore crypto enthusiasts who are ideologically opposed to integration with fiat and traditional financial markets, many can likely be brought onside. As TradFi becomes more closely entwined with DeFi, real-world assets will act as a gateway to the wider digital asset ecosystem. As institutional investors become more comfortable with decentralized assets, they’ll start looking at tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum more closely.  DeFi and TradFi are better together  The DeFi market has been stuck in a rut for close to two years following the onset of crypto winter, while traditional financial markets have continued to grow even amid the wider global economic uncertainty.  Left alone, DeFi is unlikely to ever shake off the volatility that plagues the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem, and investors will just have to endure the never-ending bull and bear market cycles for years to come. However, if DeFi opens up to real-world assets, it too can benefit from the consistent, long-term growth that’s associated with traditional financial markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,Enrico Rubboli,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/18/if-defi-wants-to-grow-it-has-to-embrace-real-world-assets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6586d7e21e6bc1415403282a820bec2ff90e77ad-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The executive was convicted for failing to submit the required documents to Turkey’s tax board. Related Reading: This Under-The-Radar Coin Just Beat The Top 100 Cryptocurrencies With 120% Explosion Thodex, which was once a prominent crypto exchange in Turkey, experienced an abrupt closure, leading its CEO, Farouk Fatih Özer, to flee to Albania. However, after an Interpol Red Notice was issued, Özer was deported back to Turkey to be held accountable for the approximately $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies belonging to investors. Özer, along with 21 other defendants, is embroiled in a protracted court case facing charges of alleged fraud, money laundering, and operating a criminal network through Thodex. Throughout the trial, Özer vehemently denied any wrongdoing and asserted that he was not the official representative of Thodex at the time, which made him unable to produce the requested books. Former CEO Of Thodex Claims To Have Been “Framed” In addition to the aforementioned charges, Özer is also facing accusations of defrauding Thodex investors and is currently awaiting a hearing to address these claims. Despite the allegations, the entrepreneur maintains his innocence and asserts that the defendants have framed him. During Özer’s first court appearance in June, he denied all charges and claimed to have been framed. He stated, “I started my company and my company was hacked,” addressing the court. The legal proceedings against Özer commenced after his failure to adhere to a notification issued on October 30, 2021. The notification requested the submission of documents pertaining to his business. Despite the notification, Özer did not provide the best requested documents within the designated legal timeframe. Özer’s claim that a trustee had been assigned to oversee the company in his absence, he was unable to produce the required documents to the Tax Inspection Board. As a result, he was convicted. Initially, the prosecutor in Özer’s case requested a five-year prison sentence on charges of “smuggling” under the Tax Procedure Law. However, the court initially sentenced the crypto entrepreneur to one year and six months of imprisonment. It was subsequently reduced to seven months and 15 days. The reduction in sentences can be attributed to various factors. These included Özer’s social relations, as well as his overall behaviour and conduct throughout the trial.

15037654,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/oasis-network-launches-sapphire-privacy-blockchain-rose,1689707700,Oasis Network Launches Sapphire Privacy Blockchain $ROSE,"Oasis Network, developers of privacy-centric blockchain products, has announced the launch of Sapphire, a privacy-focused Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible blockchain. The chain makes use of Oasis's privacy layer, and aims to offer a more secure platform for existing decentralized apps across EVM networks, eliminating the need for cross-chain swaps. Sapphire: A New Dawn for Web3 Development Sapphire represents an exciting development for privacy-focused Web3 development. With its unique privacy-first features, it is set to significantly enhance the security of dApps on any EVM network. Oasis Foundation Director Jernej Kos explained how the Oasis Privacy Layer (OPL) and Sapphire work in harmony to bolster the functionality of DApps. Specifically, he outlined how DApps can incorporate various features of Sapphire without migrating to the Oasis blockchain. ""Being fully EVM-compatible means that developers can build private smart contracts in an environment that they are already familiar with,"" Kos stated. Sapphire's full compatibility with EVM environments also bolsters cross-chain Web3 development, providing a confidential voting mechanism for decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) smart contracts, for instance. The outcome of such confidential voting can then be conveyed to the core DAO contract on a different chain. Unlocking the Power of Privacy The majority of DApps built on the Oasis blockchain are privacy-centric, and this trend is reflected in the tools and platforms developed within the Oasis ecosystem. Sapphire's release is expected to drive the development of privacy-enabled blockchain games, confidential decentralized exchanges, private voting systems, sealed-bid auctions, and key management tools, among other applications. Sapphire employs Oasis' proprietary privacy technology that relies on a secure computing technology known as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which serves as a secure enclave for smart contract execution. During execution, encrypted data is fed into the Secure Enclave alongside the smart contract, where it's decrypted and processed. The data is then re-encrypted before it leaves the Secure Enclave, ensuring that user data remains confidential and isn't disclosed to node operators or application developers. A Gateway to Familiarity and Interoperability Sapphire offers a familiar environment for blockchain developers due to its EVM compatibility. User-facing tools like the Web3 gateway, wallets, and block explorers are already familiar to many, and developers will recognize tools such as Solidity/Vyper, Hardhat/Truffle, and Web3.js/Ethers. Developers can port their DApps to Sapphire within minutes and start using its privacy technology and built-in functions such as Random Number Generation (RNG), signing, and encryption. The launch of Sapphire on testnet marks an important milestone in Oasis's roadmap. Oasis has already planned a mainnet deployment for later this year and is encouraging developers to utilize the testnet to familiarize themselves with Sapphire's capabilities. In an effort to cultivate a vibrant developer community around Sapphire, Oasis plans to host its first Sapphire Hackathon in September.

42410165,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUEnd,1689704561,"Ben McKenzie, the Hollywood Hypocrite Crypto Critic","Ben McKenzie, the former teen heartthrob who starred in “The O.C."" and ""Gotham,” jokingly refers to his somewhat recent career pivot as going from a “mid-level celebrity” to part-time crypto critic. A few years ago, at a time when many of McKenzie’s actor peers were shilling things like EthereumMAX and FTX, he started building a brand as a blockchain scold by going after what he called the “Hollywoodization of crypto.”  The actor’s latest performance reached its apogee today, with the publication of a long-awaited anti-crypto book called “Easy Money,” co-written by freelance journalist Jacob Silverman. The two started working together during the height of the pandemic, when acting work was hard to come by. In their first co-written article, published by Slate in 2021, the duo chastise actors Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather and Tom Brady, among others who were all paid crypto endorsers. (Kardashian and Mayweather were later fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.)  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  It’s hard to call McKenzie’s commentary grandstanding, considering so much of what he says about the industry is at least rooted in partial truth. But he does have a habit of making massive, totalizing claims like crypto “represents the largest Ponzi scheme in history” and calling the entire industry a fraud. A graduate 20-odd years ago from the University of Virginia with a degree in economics, McKenzie also wanders out into the realm of economic history, and is comfortable enough saying “private money” itself has failed.  You might think such a scold would steer well clear of the thing he’s criticizing. But in McKenzie’s case, he was all-in for a time.  In a recent Guardian profile, the actor disclosed he lost as much as $250,000 trying to short the market. Allegedly he got the timing wrong. The article doesn’t share many details, so we can only speculate but this wager could undercut much of what McKenzie has been saying over the years. In other words, the self-declared paid liar is also a hypocrite.  Betting crypto will collapse is one thing, but betting the industry will collapse without disclosing you stand to profit from it is a whole other game. In fact, it’s essentially the same type of arrangement McKenzie often criticized others for. Kim Kardashian settled with the SEC for failing to say she was paid to promote EthereumMAX, an altcoin built to trade on Ethereum's better standing. Although it’s unknown when his bet was open, McKenzie was a frequent guest on CNBC, Bloomberg and other daytime finance news programs yapping away about the industry’s evils.  See also: NFTs, Celebrities and Perverse Deal-Making | Opinion  In the grand scheme, this basically changes nothing. Crypto’s supporters get to point and mock and speculate whether McKenzie broke the law, and the rest of the world will largely continue to ignore blockchain or look at it disapprovingly. I’m still going to read “Easy Money,” or at least the parts featuring pre-collapse Sam Bankman-Fried and Celsius’ Alex Mashinsky. And McKenzie will continue to walk around as a moral crusader, whose best lines are probably built on other people’s research.  McKenzie often says things like crypto’s allure is rooted in the idea that “we all agree…our current financial system is deeply flawed.” People project any number of desires and hopes on crypto making a better future, by tearing down the establishment or building “sovereign individuals” up. For McKenzie, the whole thing is a charade. But, again, McKenzie is guilty of doing what he criticizes so heatedly: oversimplifying the story because he has something for sale.  It is truly problematic when people treat blockchain as a solution for everything. It is an issue that people hire celebrities to hype scams. It is morally reprehensible when some people convince others to put more than they can afford to lose even in stable projects like bitcoin. But to ignore all of crypto’s actual advancements and benefits is also a mistake. There has to be a way of pointing out that blockchain has become a hotbed of scams, without calling the whole industry a fraud.  See also: Crypto Gets Critical, With Bennett Tomlin (Podcast)  It’s a plain matter of fact that crypto has benefited people in dire straits. It may not be the perfect inflation hedge, but bitcoin has helped people protect their savings in war zones and escape repressive regimes. It’s kept controversial, but useful websites, alive for years. It’s helped fund protests and dissidents and parties. Stablecoins are increasingly found to be better for remittances and to get charitable funding to high-risk areas. People have found communities in Web3, and artists a new medium to express themselves with NFTs. Blockchain has added to the body of knowledge in cryptography, and may have a role to play addressing climate change and making governments more accountable.  McKenzie may have the resources to bet against crypto (his “expensive lesson”), but others do not. Crypto is a powerful tool in niche applications. Is it an issue when the industry is captured by delusions of grandeur about “mass adoption?” Yes. But Mr. Hollywood isn’t trying to address that. He’s not drawing notice to crypto’s flaws or workable solutions, he’s rebooting a brand using the attention of a continuously problematic industry.",NEGATIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | REGULATION,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/07/18/ben-mckenzie-the-hollywood-hypocrite-crypto-critic,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a103187c06cc4338ea2e2114e9f70dfaa4aea667-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42410173,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUFE5,1689704398,Are Bitcoin Miner Sales Preventing Breakout to Higher Prices?,"Bitcoin miners appear to be rebalancing each time prices rise above $30,000.  Bitcoin prices slipped beneath the lower range of their Bollinger Bands.  The price of bitcoin (BTC) has more than reversed last week’s rally, returning to the low end of its recent range near $29,700 on sluggish volume.  Recent market action has been notable for quick price reversals anytime bitcoin appears poised for a sustained breakout above the $31,000 level. One explanation might be sales by bitcoin miners on price rallies, a possible sign that they are in need of capital, are bearish on BTC short term, or a combination of the two. There are also two technical indicators to explore.  Have bitcoin miners turned bearish?  As bitcoin prices have pushed past $30,000 for most of this month, bitcoin miners have been decreasing their overall net position. According to on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the 30 day change of supply in miner addresses has been negative for 20 consecutive days.  This marks a distinction from the time period between April 10 and June 27, when the industry’s net position was positive for all days but one.  Does the change indicate a shift in sentiment or simply a need for cash-strapped miners to sell into strength to fund operations? The answer is likely a combination of the two.  Given BTC’s 80% gain year to date, it’s not unreasonable to expect that bitcoin miners would be apt to take some profits off of the table. Overall trading volume, however, has not been strong enough to indicate their mass exodus from the asset.  Additionally, miners' overall bitcoin balances are currently 1.83 million coins versus 1.82 million on January 1, implying that recent activity may simply be a rebalancing of their overall position rather than a commentary on price level.  Bitcoin has breached the lower range of its Bollinger Bands  Bollinger Bands are a technical indicator which tracks an asset’s 20 day moving average against price levels two standard deviations above and below that average. As prices are expected to stay within two standard deviations of its average 95% of the time, breaches above or below are statistically significant events.  A recent bullish example occurred on June 14, with prices moving sharply higher shortly following an upside breach.  Action today is potentially bearish, with the current price of $29,750 being a minor downside breach of the $29,800 low end of the Bollinger Band range.  Significant price agreement exists at the $30,000 level  Absent a new catalyst, BTC prices seemed poised to continue resting near the $30,000 level. Bitcoin’s volume at price profile shows substantial activity at $30,500 since May. These high activity levels by price point are often called “high volume nodes,” indicating significant price agreement between traders and thus often signaling areas where prices stabilize.

MNT, which pays for gas fees on the Mantle network and grants token holders governance power, currently sits at 52 cents, after debuting at 48 cents on Monday, according to data from CoinGecko.  ARB and OP — the native tokens for rival layer 2 Ethereum scaling solutions Arbitrum and Optimism, respectively — have both declined over the past 24 hours, CryptoWatch data shows. While Mantle is a layer 2 blockchain like Optimism and Arbitrum, Mantle “sets itself apart by incorporating EigenLayer’s EigenDA, resulting in a distinctive three-layer modular blockchain structure,” Nansen research analyst Sandra Leow wrote in a report.  “Ethereum handles the settlement and consensus layer in this structure, EigenDA ensures data availability, and Mantle Network serves as the execution layer,” Leow noted.  On May 19, BitDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization with the largest treasury in the crypto space, rebranded itself as Mantle and voted to convert its BIT token to MNT tokens, applying a “One brand, One token” principle.  According to a blog post, exchanges Bybit, MEXC and Huobi are supporting the token migration. Per Etherscan, Bybit is the third largest holder of MNT, with more than 15% of the total supply. Moreover, sister companies Jump Capital and Jump Trading have together accumulated more than $5.3 million MNT tokens, after several wallets converted BIT to MNT in multiple transactions, data from blockchain analytics platform Nansen shows.  A Jump Trading representative did not immediately respond to a request to comment from CoinDesk for this story.

Moreover, Wood’s confidence aligns with other experts who believe that this ruling could have significant implications for Coinbase and its ongoing legal battles with regulatory authorities. Ripple Court Ruling: A Boost for Crypto Exchanges and Coinbase The recent court ruling in favor of Ripple against the SEC has sparked reactions within the crypto industry. Cathie Wood, along with several industry pundits, has lauded the ruling, recognizing its potential positive impact on Coinbase and other exchanges. Related Reading: 29% Of Bitcoin’s Circulating Supply Is Now Presumed Lost Forever The court found that XRP tokens sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges were not securities, setting a precedent that could favor Coinbase and Binance in their legal disputes with the SEC. Wood, in a video posted on Bloomberg’s Twitter handle, emphasized that despite receiving a Wells notice in March and facing a lawsuit from the SEC in June, Coinbase’s share price demonstrated resilience, suggesting the robustness of its stock value. The CEO’s bullish comments come after ARK Investment Management recently sold a significant number of Coinbase shares, with three of its ETFs cashing in on the exchange’s rally. Despite these sales, Wood’s bullish outlook on Coinbase remains unshaken. COIN price sitting at $106.75 | Source: Coinbase Global, Inc. on TradingView.com The cryptocurrency exchange’s share price, which started the year at $33.60, has surged over 184%, reaching $105.55 at the time of publication. However, while industry players increasingly express optimism toward Coinbase, analysts from Berenberg Capital Markets caution that various regulatory challenges for crypto exchanges are yet to be fully resolved. Regulatory Concerns Linger Despite Coinbase’s Resilience Despite Coinbase’s strong performance and Wood’s optimism, regulatory uncertainties persist within the crypto exchange sector. Berenberg Capital Markets analysts highlight unresolved aspects of crypto exchange regulation, including concerns about Coinbase Earn, a product that offers yield on crypto staking. The comments made by Judge Analisa Torres raise questions about the potential classification of Coinbase Earn as a security, signaling the need for further clarity in this area. Related Reading: USDC Market Cap Drops As Redemptions Climb To $1.4 Billion Nevertheless, Wood’s continued bullish stance on Coinbase following the Ripple court ruling reflects her confidence in the exchange’s ability to navigate regulatory challenges successfully. It is also crucial to acknowledge that the evolving regulatory landscape and ongoing legal battles with the SEC require careful monitoring. Achieving clarity and resolution in crypto exchange regulation remains essential to ensure the long-term stability and growth of the industry.

15035642,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/chainlink-debuts-ccip-across-multiple-mainnets-link,1689703200,Chainlink Debuts CCIP Across Multiple Mainnets $LINK,"Chainlink has launched its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) for early adopters, with a full roll-out soon to follow. The protocol is designed to serve and facilitate cross-chain transactions across a number of blockchains currently operating from within and alongside the Ethereum and EVM ecosystems. Notably, this innovative protocol is now live on several major blockchain platforms, namely Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. The integration of this service has already stimulated the market, evidenced by the near 10% uptick in the price of Chainlink's native token, LINK, which soared to a high of $7.30 in the wake of the announcement. Boosting Blockchain Connectivity with CCIP Earlier this week, Chainlink's official blog post unveiled the CCIP's early access availability on multiple blockchain platforms. This development not only enhances the potential for interconnectivity among various blockchain ecosystems but also empowers developers by providing a robust platform to create custom cross-chain solutions. A key advantage that the CCIP brings to the table is its ""Simplified Token Transfers"" feature. This functionality empowers protocols to expedite the process of sending tokens across chains, all under the assurance of audited token pool contracts. This cross-chain protocol is a collaborative undertaking involving Swift, the esteemed global financial messaging network. The CCIP leverages Swift's advanced messaging infrastructure, facilitating seamless token transfers across an array of public and private blockchains. Key Elements of The Protocol The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has been designed to cater to developers' needs by providing them with flexible tools to create custom cross-chain solutions. An example of this is its Arbitrary Messaging feature, which opens up the possibility for unique cross-chain applications. Additionally, Simplified Token Transfers, which utilize audited token pool contracts, streamline the process of moving tokens across chains. This feature saves development time by eliminating the need for writing custom code. A key element of CCIP's implementation strategy is its collaboration with established financial messaging network Swift (stylized in some cases as SWIFT), along with several financial institutions. This collaboration focuses on utilizing existing messaging infrastructures to facilitate token transfers across diverse blockchain environments. By enabling traditional finance to connect with decentralized networks, this innovative approach lays a foundation for a new phase of collaborative advancement between these two sectors. The integration of CCIP into multiple major blockchains marks a significant stride in improving blockchain interoperability, fostering greater connectivity, and utility in decentralized networks. Chainlink is also partnered with Coinbase Cloud, which is designated as a node operator. Chainlink's co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, pointed out that the CCIP serves in such a way that it [functions to]: ""connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts."" Nazarov further emphasized that such a technological advancement would be vital in shaping and sustaining a society powered by blockchain. Various prominent financial institutions and enterprises, including the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Euroclear, and Lloyds Banking Group, are currently exploring the possibilities and benefits presented by the CCIP.

Armstrong has voiced his concerns about the lack of clear rules around the cryptocurrency space. In May, he said his U.S.-based company will always have a presence in the country, even though ""the U.S. is a little bit behind right now” in terms of crypto regulation. At the meeting, Armstrong will discuss digital-asset legislation, among other related issues like tax, national security, privacy and climate, with members of the New Democrat Coalition, a caucus made up of almost 100 Democrats who take a pro-business stance, Bloomberg reported Monday, citing Democratic aides familiar with the plans. The news comes a month after the SEC sued Coinbase ( COIN ) for allegedly operating as an unregistered securities broker. But Coinbase denies the regulator's claims. ""Instead of publishing a clear rule book, the SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach that is harming America,"" Armstrong wrote in a Twitter post on the same day his company got sued. ""So if we need to avail ourselves of the courts to get clarity, so be it."" Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has also come under heightened regulatory scrutiny.

Among the early adopters of this service is Sushi, a decentralized exchange (DEX), aiming to use the ITS to foster seamless interactions of its native SUSHI token across multiple blockchain networks. Driving Cross-Chain Integration with ITS Axelar’s ITS primarily focuses on the interoperability of ERC-20 tokens across all EVM-compatible ecosystems. These tokens are generated on a 1:1 ratio and are managed through Axelar’s native computing environment, the Axelar Virtual Machine. The newly revealed service is set to provide a muchj-needed boost to the ease of token interaction across Ethereum-compatible chains. Decentralized exchange Sushi is set to be one of the first adopters of the “interchain tokens” provided through this service. Sushi's team plans to use the ITS to facilitate seamless interaction of its native SUSHI token across multiple chains. Initial deployment will ensure interoperability of SUSHI across Arbitrum, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon. This move will enable SushiSwap, Sushi's decentralized exchange, to manage its multichain deployments more efficiently via the Axelar network. Jared Grey, Sushi’s head chef, emphasized the utility of this service, stating: ""Axelar’s Interchain Token Service unlocks a more seamless, interchain experience for Sushi users."" Tackling Security and Compatibility Challenges The traditional approach to facilitating cross-chain transfers for Web3 applications generally relied on bridged token versions. These bridged versions could be exposed to inherent security risks and compatibility issues. Axelar’s interoperability solution, according to co-founder Sergey Gorbunov, addresses these challenges. Gorbunov noted that Axelar's innovative approach utilizes specialized smarlt contracts and a software development kit, which enables developers to manage interchain tokens more efficiently. Notably, Gorbunov says that the bridged versions of tokens, similar to SUSHI, currently lack fungibility and carry a bridge risk. In contrast, Interchain Tokens represent a ""true"" cross-chain interoperability merged with security and simplicity. The news comes after Axelar's announcement following its partnership with Chainlink's cross-chain interoperability protocol. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

15033340,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543091,1689697823,"Litecoin Whales Deposit Big To Exchanges, Bearish Sign?","Data shows that Litecoin whales have deposited a large amount of the asset to exchanges during the past day, a sign that may be bearish for LTC. Litecoin Whales Have Made Significant Exchange Inflows In 24 Hours According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, several large transfers have taken place on the LTC blockchain during the past day. In total, there have been four such transactions, with the largest of them involving the movement of 500,000 LTC (around $46 million at the time the transfer went through). While the other three interestingly all saw the same number of tokens moving on the network: 78,760 LTC (the USD price fluctuated between each of these transactions, but on average, the stacks were worth $7.2 million at the time of movement). As all these transactions are so large, it’s possible that whale entities were behind them. The whales are generally influential beings in the market, as they hold very large amounts in their wallets. Thus, their movements are usually something to look out for, as they may precede volatility in the price. Naturally, how the price may be influenced by these humongous investors’ transfers depends on what exactly they wanted to achieve with said transactions. Here are some additional details regarding the largest of today’s transfers, which may help shed some light on the context surrounding it: Looks like this LTC transfer required a negligible fee to go through | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sending address in the case of this Litecoin transfer was an unknown wallet, meaning that it was unattached to any known centralized platform. Such addresses are usually investors’ personal wallets. The receiving address, on the other hand, was connected to a centralized platform: the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Transfers like this where coins move from self-custodial wallets to exchanges are called “exchange inflows.” Usually, one of the major reasons why holders may deposit their coins to exchanges is for selling-related purposes, so exchange inflows can have bearish effects on the price. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Selling Again, Will Price Crash Again? It’s possible that the whale here also made this deposit with a similar intention. Naturally, if it’s truly the case, the price could feel visible negative effects from it, considering the scale of the transaction. As for the other three transactions that were all of the exact same scale, two of these transfers were inflows similar to this one, while the remaining one was an outflow. Two of these transfers (both inflows) shared the same sending and receiving addresses, making it likely that the same whale might have been behind the deposits. The outflow’s receiving address doesn’t match any of the transactions from today, so it’s unknown if it’s related to them. However, it involves the exact same number of coins as the two inflows, so it raises suspicion that the same whale entity may have been behind it after all. Related Reading: Stablecoin Exchange Deposits Remain Low, What Does It Mean For Bitcoin? In any case, one reality continues to stand: there were total net inflows of $53.2 million in the last 24 hours, which can act as a source of significant selling pressure in the market for the cryptocurrency.

42410175,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUFRJ,1689695102,Unpacking the Latest Lummis-Gillibrand Bill Draft,"U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand have developed a second draft of their comprehensive crypto regulation bill. Chances are slim that it will, as a single bill, advance to becoming a law, but it may still drive a broader conversation within Congress on what sort of provisions smaller pieces of legislation should include.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Round 2  The narrative  The bill introduced last week by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kristen Gillibrand builds on a first draft introduced a year ago.  Why it matters  While regulators are continuing to try and determine how crypto assets might fall within their various jurisdictions, Congress continues to look at the broader question of whether and what types of new laws might be needed.  Breaking it down  U.S. Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) unveiled a second version of their crypto bill last week, creating a definition for decentralized finance and addressing issues ranging from anti-money laundering provisions to custody rules. The bill also grants the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) clearer authority over crypto issuers, giving the Securities and Exchange Commission a defined, but arguably more limited role than it enjoys at present.  It’s not clear to me whether this version of the bill has any greater chance at becoming a law than last year’s version. But it doesn’t have to become a law to be a success. This is a comprehensive bill – if other lawmakers decide to borrow parts, or at least look at parts while they consider their own legislation, this bill could still drive the conversation in D.C., such as it is.  Of course, the biggest hurdle the lawmakers face is their fellow lawmakers: Congress as a whole has shown not much appetite for passing any crypto-specific legislation into law in the current climate, though bills continue to be introduced.  The House Financial Services Committee may be the closest to moving any legislation, with markups anticipated on the stablecoin and market-structure bills currently introduced to that body.  The bill itself addresses a wide swath of the crypto industry’s biggest questions. Perhaps the most important details are defined in sections 4 and 5. Section 4 – titled “responsible commodities regulation” in a section-by-section fact sheet – defines the terms “crypto asset” and “crypto asset exchange” under commodities law, enshrining CFTC authority over crypto spot markets.  This is a key ask by that regulator, and echoes a goal of last year’s version of the bill. One criticism of the first draft came from SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who cautioned that it might “undermine” other rules overseeing securities markets. The lawmakers say they incorporated SEC feedback into this new version, creating another definition for crypto assets which are not securities despite not being decentralized and which depend on “entrepreneurial and managerial efforts that determine” their value. The SEC can challenge whether any given asset is indeed not a security.  Other important provisions include a de minimus tax exemption of up to $200 for payments. This is another major issue for the industry: Right now, every type of transaction faces a capital gains/loss tax, regardless of the amount transacted. Someone buying a cup of coffee for $2.50 would face the same type of tax liability as someone who transacts with thousands of dollars’ worth of crypto.  Beyond the actual literal cost, the tax rules currently in place also require all U.S. persons to keep track of each transaction for when they file their tax returns, an issue for both individual users and the IRS. This type of provision would address these concerns.  Some of these provisions echo bills or regulatory issues we’ve seen before: there are definitions for stablecoins, algorithmic stablecoins, anti-money laundering rules, the definition of a “broker” for tax purposes and settlement finality.  Regardless of its chances of becoming law, this bill should likely generate some discussion. If you have any thoughts the various provisions – whether you think something needs clarity, is unnecessary, will help the industry immensely, etc. – reply to this email and you may see your comment in next week’s edition of the newsletter.

The clock starts ticking this week for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision on whether to approve or reject six applications – including BlackRock's – to list a spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

Initially, this sets a deadline of 45 days, but that can be extended to as long as 240 days.  The register is the daily gazette of the U.S. government and contains executive orders, federal agency regulations, proposed agency rules and other documents that, by law, have to published.  While there is no guarantee the SEC will approve any of the applications, the filing by industry giant BlackRock has fueled speculation that permission is more likely.

The digital asset, following a significant legal win last week, now claims 21% of all cryptocurrency trade volume over the last week. This achievement is just one of many in Ripple’s recent journey in the spotlight. Ripple’s presence in the news lately owes to a landmark court decision in its favor. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had initially taken legal action against the firm, accusing it of selling unregistered securities. However, a federal judge in New York has recently declared that XRP is only security when sold directly to institutional investors under specific written contracts. And when the token was sold to retail investors on crypto exchanges, it is not deemed a security. This verdict led to major cryptocurrency exchanges relisting XRP, causing a subsequent surge in demand and trading volume. Related Reading: XRP Holdings On Bitrue Exchange Surges By 300% Ripple Through The Market Last week’s court decision catalyzed a rally for XRP, as its price experienced an approximate 65% increase.

Yet, this has not seemed to have put a damper on the market sentiment for XRP. The recent spike in weekly trading volume highlights the increased interest and activity surrounding the token. Over the past 7 days, XRP has seen a surge of 59.4% in both its market cap and price. XRP market capitalization has spiked from a cap low of $25 billion earlier last week to as high as over $39 billion as of today. In addition, the asset’s price has also moved from as low as $0.47 earlier last week to trade above the $0.74 mark at the time of writing. The token’s present value translates to an increase of nearly 3% for the digital asset in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin’s Stumble Bitcoin, on the other hand, appears to have hit a stumbling block. Despite multiple attempts, Bitcoin has struggled to push past the $30,000 mark. Although Bitcoin remains a leading actor in the cryptocurrency market, XRP’s recent surge in weekly trading volume has momentarily eclipsed Bitcoin’s longstanding volume dominance.

42410186,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMdg,1689693814,Messaging Platform Telegram Has Issued $270M in Bonds to Fund Growth,"Messaging platform Telegram issued $270 million in bonds this week to fund its growth until ""we reach the break-even point,"" CEO Pavel Durov announced Tuesday.  The platform is not yet profitable and has rising expenses due to its ""massive growth,"" Durov said: it's onboarding 2.5 million new users a day and earlier this year hit 800 million monthly active users.  ""I personally bought about a quarter of the new Telegram bonds, investing tens of millions into Telegram's growth. This comes in addition to the hundreds of millions I spent over the last 10 years to keep Telegram operational,"" Durov said.  The alternative messaging platform has long been a favorite among crypto enthusiasts. That's partly attributable to the company's defunct efforts to launch its own crypto token, GRAM. While that effort ended in defeat as well as an SEC lawsuit, a related spinoff project continues under the name Toncoin.  ""Some people suggested I should have instead bought a house or a jet,"" Durov said. ""But I prefer to stay focused on my work, without 'owning' anything (well, apart from Telegram, some Bitcoin and some Toncoin).""  Toncoin jumped 1% following the announcement.

42410191,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMnb,1689693669,"Ripple Court Ruling Unlikely to Impact Celsius Wind-Up, Crypto Lender’s Counsel Says","A landmark judgment about whether the Ripple-linked XRP token is a security is unlikely to impact plans for the wind-up of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, the bankrupt crypto lender’s counsel told a New York court on Tuesday.  Last week a court ruled XRP constituted a security when offered to institutional buyers like hedge funds – something that has attracted the attention of Judge Martin Glenn, in parallel bankruptcy proceedings for Celsius.  “We don't think it [the Ripple judgment] has any effect outside of potentially the CEL token issue,” Chris Koeing of law firm Kirkland and Ellis, representing Celsius, told the court, adding that the new company set to take over “is not engaged in any securities offerings and has not engaged in any of Celsius’ historic business practices.”  The Fahrenheit consortium, which won a recent bid for Celsius’ assets, will concentrate on less legally contentious issues like bitcoin mining and Ethereum staking, Koenig said.  The XRP ruling could impact creditor repayments for holdings of Celsius’ token CEL, given U.S. bankruptcy rules which apply a mandatory downgrade to customer claims relating to securities. The estate has previously judged the token’s worth at $0.20, but it could also fall to zero, Koenig said, while some creditors have argued it should be valued at $0.81, its apparent price at the time of bankruptcy in July 2022.  ‘Terminated in short-order’  Last week Celsius’ founder and former CEO Alex Mashinsky, alongside Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon, were charged on multiple fraud counts by the Department of Justice, as well as by securities, commodities and trade regulators. Mashinsky has pleaded not guilty and his lawyers described the charges as “baseless.”  On learning of the indictment of Cohen-Pavon, an Israeli citizen, last week, a special committee of Celsius’ board immediately met to authorize him to be fired, Koenig said.  “He is expected to be terminated in short order” once a hearing required by Israeli law occurs, Koenig said. “Even prior to this process, Mr. Cohen-Pavon did not have significant authority with respect to the debtors’ day to day operations.”  In parallel to Mashinsky’s arrest, regulators announced a number of deals with Celsius in a bid to avoid any impact on creditor distributions. The stipulation the company entered into with the Securities and Exchange Commission would back up the regulator’s claim that CEL and Celsius’ Earn Interest Account are securities, Koenig said.

Bitcoin Realized Cap Nears $400 Billion According to Data analytics firm Glassnode, Bitcoin’s Realized Cap is now inching closer to $400 billion, showing that new capital is continuously entering the market despite the year’s ups and downs. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Raises Bitcoin Forecast To $120,000, Citing Miners’ Reduced Selling Bitcoin’s Realized Cap represents the total value of all BTC at the price they were last moved or transacted, indicating the cost basis of holders. When this metric rises, it reveals that BTC is being traded at progressively higher prices, which suggests an increase in demand. Glassnode reported that the increase in BTC’s realized cap signals the consistent influx of capital into the asset throughout the year 2023. This steady inflow represents a stable investment climate surrounding Bitcoin, despite its recent price fluctuations. Furthermore, Glassnode’s assessment of the ascending realized cap is indicative of a broader trend in the cryptocurrency market. The data analytics firms said, “It signals that coins are changing hands at higher prices on net,” – a phenomenon that underlines a rising demand for Bitcoin. It is worth noting that this recorded increasing demand for Bitcoin comes at a time the asset might have flashed a hope of bullish moves following the surge in Spot Bitcoin ETF filings and financial giants such as BlackRock embracing the largest asset by market cap. BTC Struggles To Push Past $30,000 Meanwhile, as Bitcoin realized’s cap is approaching $400 billion, the asset has struggled to make a significant move above the $30,000 mark. Over the past 24 hours alone, the BTC price has traded both below and above the $30,000 mark, suggesting a level of consolidation at this point. Particularly, the asset currently has a 24-hour high of $30,292 and a 24-hour low of $29,792, at the time of writing. However, regardless of that, BTC is currently down by only a slight dip of 1% in the last 24 hours with a trading price of $29,882. This latest price action follows Bitcoin’s quick spike which was seen last week on July 13. This surge brought Bitcoin price to trade even above the $31,000 mark before briefly slipping below $30,000. Over the past few days, however, a total of more than $30 billion has been removed from the BTC market cap.

The charts have shown a notable decline in the price of Polkadot, leaving investors curious about its future trajectory. However, analysts have predicted that another token, Tradecurve (TCRV), will lead the next crypto bull run. Polkadot (DOT) Price Analysis: Why Is Polkadot Going Down? Over the past week, the price of Polkadot l has been range-bound, fluctuating between $5.00 and $5.50. Despite the launch of Polkadot 2.0, the token has faced significant bearish pressure, evident in the long wick on its July 6th candlestick, suggesting selling pressure during intraday rallies. According to CoinMarketCap, the current price of Polkadot stands at $5.12, reflecting a 6.34% decline over the past seven days. Although Polkadot's price has dipped below the moving averages recently, there are indications of a potential recovery as the token experiences a modest 0.88% increase in the last 24 hours. Moreover, trading volume on the network has witnessed an 8.30% surge within the past 24 hours. Currently, Polkadot has surpassed the 50-Day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at $5.05, yet it still remains below the 200-Day SMA at $5.72. A positive sign would be a breakout above the $5.15 mark, signaling solid demand. In such a scenario, the bulls would likely attempt to drive the pair towards $5.64. On the downside, if bearish pressure lingers, the token could drop to $4.74. Tradecurve (TCRV) To Lead The Next Crypto Bull Run As Polkadot gears up for a rebound, market experts have predicted that Tradecurve could lead the next crypto bull run, surpassing the likes of Bitcoin. The market's belief in the potential of Tradecurve stems from its plan to bridge the crypto and traditional financial sector. Why Tradecurve (TCRV) Can Rally By 100X While platforms like Binance and Coinbase already offer derivative options and futures for cryptocurrencies, Tradecurve seeks to expand this offering by incorporating a wide range of instruments from the traditional financial market. These instruments encompass commodities, indices, stocks, ETFs, forex, and cryptocurrencies, enabling traders to access a more diverse and comprehensive portfolio. Tradecurve gains the ability to tap into the OTC derivatives market worth over $632 trillion in 2022. It does so by introducing derivatives tied to traditional financial instruments, Tradecurve also has other features like copy trading, AI algorithmic trading, high leverage, and a metaverse trading academy. Tradecurve has attracted significant attention. This is with a projected price surge of 50x during the presale phase and up to 100x upon the launch of the trading platform, Experts Opinion: Time To Take Advantage Currently trading at $0.018, a 100X price increase could propel the token's value to $1.8, potentially propelling it into the top 100 cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization before the end of 2023. Savvy investors have recognized the opportunity and have already acquired millions of TCRV tokens, positioning themselves early for potential gains.

42410182,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMTl,1689688918,Tokenize Everything: Institutions Bet That Crypto’s Future Lies in the Real World,"Think of the biggest knocks on crypto: Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin aren’t “real,” because they’re not backed by hard assets in the real world; They’re highly speculative, and the yo-yoing prices can doom unsophisticated investors; often they’re even ridiculous, with meme-coins and cartoon apes selling for millions.  You don’t have to agree with these critiques. (I don’t, at least not fully.) But the merits of these arguments are irrelevant. Like it or not, these are some of the reasons that most banks, financial institutions, governments, and billions of “normies” have still not bought a lick of crypto.  But what if the next generation of crypto is not made of “magic internet money” that non-nerds had never heard of, but the cryptographic “tokenization” of stocks, bonds, cars, and real-life things that people actually care about?  And people – including the suits on Wall Street – are starting to care about the tokenization of real world assets, or RWAs, which has quietly surged during crypto winter. Tokenization lets you “create liquidity for things that aren’t liquid today,” says Lucas Vogelsang, CEO and co-founder of Centrifuge, which has tokenized over $400 million of RWAs.  Whereas most cryptocurrency is an entirely new breed of asset -- from bitcoin to eth to dogecoin – tokenization takes assets from the “real” world and puts them on-chain, marrying the perks of blockchain with assets from the real world.  That tokenized “stuff” can be almost anything. Artwork, real-estate, luxury items, wine bottles, cars, carbon credits, and financial instruments like T-bills and stocks -- they can all go on-chain. “We’re trying to get everything to tokens, then we’re going to try to see if we can wipe out all the costs from the underlying systems,” says Allan Pedersen, CEO of the Monetalis group, which has worked to tokenize RWAs and use them as collateral on MakerDAO. Pedersen says they have tokenized $1.2 billion in treasury bills that are now used by Maker as collateral.  Even intellectual property can be tokenized. Let’s start with a hypothetical. “Think of someone running a YouTube channel, who makes how-to videos about cooking,” says Sid Powell, CEO and co-founder of Maple, which tokenizes assets and then turns them into collateral. Now imagine that this YouTube cook, who’s funny and charismatic, has grown a large audience. She earns $50,000 per month from YouTube ad revenue.  The creator could tokenize that copyright and sell it to a financier. “We buy the token copyright off them. We own the rights to all the royalty streams from their YouTube cooking videos,” explains Powell. If the annual royalties are valued at $600k, the financier could buy at $550k (allowing some built-in yield), which gives the chef a loan against these future earnings.  This type of model exists in the world of larger music companies and private equity, says Powell, but it’s not accessible to the smaller players. Tokenization makes these tools more inclusive. “Tokenization has the potential to democratize access to capital markets for borrowers,” says Morgan Krupetsky, Director of Business Development for Institutions and Capital Markets at Ava Labs. “Smaller deal sizes and lower investment minimums are made economically viable.”  Tokenization lets you create liquidity for things that aren’t liquid today  Even the more ho-hum business projects like “shipping grain” could benefit from tokenization. Another hypothetical: A shipper wants to send grain across the ocean. Typically the shipper would get financing from a bank. They would collateralize the loan with the grain. “That’s something that’s well-suited to come on-chain, because it involves cross-border finance,” says Powell. He views the current system as analogous to Blockbuster Video vs. Netflix. “If I’m Blockbuster and I’m currently in Brazil, and I want to serve a client in Bulgaria, I have to set up a Blockbuster branch in Bulgaria,” says Powell. “If I’m Netflix, the person just has to have an internet connection.”  Back to the grain shipping. Instead of only being able to get loans from banks in Brazil or Bulgaria, the grain-shipper could now, through tokenization, find capital from anywhere on the planet. You’re in the streaming world of Netflix. “It turns the global financial market into a clearing house,” says Powell.  Maybe the average person isn’t concerned about shipping grain. But the suits in finance can do the math, they can imagine the possibilities, and they envision the complete transformation of financial markets. A report from Boston Consulting Group suggests that by 2030, the tokenized RWA market could swell to $16 trillion. That’s an awfully abstract number visualize. So for some perspective on just how big the market can be, consider that the market cap of bitcoin is currently $600 billion. If bitcoin’s market cap were $16 trillion? Each bitcoin would be worth $800,000.  Welcome to the sneaky-lucrative world of RWAs.  Private equity, public upside  Tokenization is not a new tech; it’s just getting new adoption and new love. In an echo of how early adopters tinkered with NFTs years before they burst into the mainstream -- think CryptoPunks, Rare Pepes -- tokenization has been around since 2017. Now they’re having a moment.  The infrastructure has improved, the onramps are smoother, institutions are token-curious, and surprising economic forces have spurred adoption. “As interest rates have risen, many of the RWA options offer double-digit returns through interest, without the crypto volatility risk,” writes financial adviser Adam Blumberg in a CoinDesk op-ed. “They can make low-risk loans in markets where Traditional Finance can’t or won’t go, and keep the process efficient.”  While FTX and the embarrassments of 2022 still darken the image of crypto, banks and governments have quietly -- almost stealthily -- dabbled in the tokenization of RWAs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore is now tokenizing bonds; they’re working with DBS Bank and JP Morgan. Gold is being tokenized. Research from Bank of America found that the tokenized market for gold alone surpassed $1 billion, as “tokenized gold provides exposure to physical gold, 24/7 real-time settlement, no management fees and no storage or insurance costs.”  Some tokenization projects don’t even sound all that exciting -- like tokenizing t-bills -- but Krupetsky says they can slash costs for things like certification, underwriting, asset monitoring, and fund disbursements, as this red tape is “historically and operationally burdensome, manual, and time-intensive.” That’s partly why banks and corporations are intrigued. “Institutions see tokenization as highly promising, and are looking to move more quickly toward investing in tokenized assets, as well as tokenizing their own assets over the next two years,” found a recent report from Ernst and Young, which conducted a survey finding that 57% of institutional investors want exposure to tokenized assets.  What’s so alluring to these TradFi types?  Consider private equity funds. “Blockchain can replace the entire fund,” says Philipp Pieper, co-founder of Swarm, another start-up that tokenizes RWAs. “A smart contract can do the same thing a fund manager would do normally, and would be taking 100 to 200 basis points out of the equation.”  For the more exclusive “closed” private equity funds, tokenization could make the game more fluid. Let’s say a private equity fund, called the Annoyingly Wealthy Group, jointly bought a company. They’re investing in this company for at least five years. When can they sell and book their profits? The Annoyingly Wealthy members might not agree on the timing.  After Year Five, some might want to press their luck and hope the company (that they now own) keeps growing. Some might think the “top is in” (as in the company is now at the peak of its value, so they should sell high). Some might simply want their capital for other things. With tokenization, as Pieper describes it, you could have a “smart-contract based secondary market” for the fund, which gives them a “structured way to fractionally de-risk or increase the risk, depending on what they see.”  To those not in high finance, your eyes might glaze over at the inner-workings of equity funds. And making life cushier for wealthy venture capitalists was not, perhaps, the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto. Then again, these innovations are appealing to the power players of traditional finance, and these are the very influencers -- whether you like it or not -- that will be needed for the widespread adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.  “We are in some ways dependent on large lenders” to enter the space, says Vogelsang, Centrifuge’s CEO. He says that today’s early adopters of DeFi simply aren’t a large enough population to grow the space to $100 trillion, which is what he sees as its ultimate destiny. “That money will come from pension funds, from banks, from the current companies,” says Vogelsang. “So the big work is to get them comfortable with the technology, and to get them to understand it, so they’ll start using it.”  Even stocks can be tokenized. This at first struck me as strange and even a bit pointless, as the buying and selling of stocks seems pretty easy -- and cheap -- with zero-commission options that range from Charles Schwab to Robin Hood. But there are benefits beneath the surface.  “You can’t really buy a fraction of Tesla or Amazon or Netflix,” says Bob Ras, co-creator of Sologenic, which tokenizes securities like stocks, ETFs and commodities. “When you tokenize, users can buy a fraction of these stocks.”  Ras acknowledges that with the Robin Hood app, users actually can buy fractional shares of Tesla or Amazon, but he says this is only because Robin Hood bought a motherlode of popular stocks and lets users buy partial chunks from within the app. (Whether users appreciate this distinction only time will tell.)  When you buy or sell a token, the settlement is instant. That matters in trading. In the current financial system, even in the wealthy corners of Wall Street, it still takes two to three days for transactions to fully settle. That has a cost. Banks, hedge funds, and trading desks are eager to deploy their capital as soon as it’s available -- tokenization puts their money to work faster.  Tokenization, at times, can even cut out the middleman of the U.S. dollar. It’s common for investors to sell one asset (like Tesla stock) to another (like Wal-Mart stock). To do this, you need to sell your Tesla (for dollars) and buy Wal-Mart (with dollars). Tokenization could do this faster. In a process that Ray calls “cross conversion,” you can swap your Tesla tokens directly for Wal-Mart tokens. Users could find and create their own trading pairs on a decentralized exchange, says Ras, with the invisible hand of the free market bringing Wal-Mart token holders to Tesla token holders, almost like a magnetic force. The kicker? Because you never sold to U.S. dollars, you wouldn’t pay capital gains tax. (It’s possible, of course, that future regulation could close this loophole.)  Maybe tokenizing stocks will just be a novelty. But if it’s truly cheaper and more efficient, and if it eventually scales to become the new normal, the impact could change Wall Street in ways it’s hard to imagine. Stocks could be traded 24/7, like cryptocurrency. Typically the bulk of trading happens between 9:30am and 10:30am EST, and all of Corporate America times its earning reports, communications, and financial decisions (such as dividend buy-backs) to the well-established rhythms of the Monday-to-Friday U.S. stock market. Tokenization -- if it goes fully mainstream -- could scramble all of the financial markets.  Pieper calls tokenization “Fin Tech 2.0.” As he outlined in a Medium post, he sees tokenization as a natural progression from ETFs (exchange-traded funds), which were created in the early 1990s. ETFs transformed the stock market; tokenization could do the same. ETFs let investors gain exposure into a basket of themed assets, such as an airlines or health care or energy. With tokenization? The portfolio can become “atomized,” letting you create a mix of stocks and cryptocurrencies and other asset classes that haven’t even been invented, “putting users at the heart of financial instrument design.” Tokenization creates liquidity pools, and these pools can earn yield.  You can be forgiven if your Spidey Sense tingles at the phrase “earning yield.” In 2022, it was the very promise of too-good-to-be true yield that led to meltdowns like Celsius. As I wrote back then, then Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky confidently told crowds that with “much less risk” than banks, Celsius managed to “deliver high single-digit or low double-digit” returns. (It then filed for bankruptcy while New York’s attorney general accused Mashinsky of fraud.)  Or zoom out even further. In 2008, the banks juiced their profits by trading baroque financial packages -- that they didn’t fully understand -- containing bundled subprime loans. We all know what happened next. The loans were toxic, the banks wobbled, the economy collapsed. So if we create a clever new system of loans and debt with RWAs, are we just repeating history and boosting the odds of a financial crisis?  If the world truly becomes tokenized, Real World Assets, will drop the clunky 'Real World.' They’ll just be assets  Vogelsang acknowledges that the tech “could create a lot of dangerous bad products,” but argues that the very nature of these DeFi tools, at their core, enables transparency and makes a collapse less likely. “A lot of the 2008 issue was that people didn’t really know what it [the subprime loan bundle] was,” says Vogelsang. “No one really knew. Retail users didn’t know, and no one really knew.”  Tokenization is transparent. The assets and liabilities are there for all to see. “The details of asset ownership, transfers, and transactions can be recorded on the blockchain, providing a verifiable and auditable history,” says Daniela Barbosa, Executive Director of Hyperledger Foundation. “This transparency both enhances trust and reduces fraud.” So with this transparency, theoretically, it will be easier to spot systemic risk.  The key word here, of course, is theoretically. Plenty of things sound transparent and risk-free in crypto -- just ask the investors of Terra.  Leveling the field  The trillion-dollar question in all of crypto right now is, “Does the SEC consider it a security?” One of the happy benefits of tokenizing real-world securities is that there’s no ambiguity about, well, whether said token is a security. It is what it says it is. “People have done backflips to avoid being called a security,” says Pieper. “They’ve built in fake utility to make it look like it’s not a security.” For this reason, Swarm (along with many of the other tokenization projects) is -- for now -- only available to accredited investors.  That said, appealing to “accredited investors,” ultimately, is not the north star of tokenization. Its champions think they can help regular people. Think about small business loans. Private credit is a market that’s illiquid for smaller companies, which gives a leg-up to the corporations. “When Google issues a bond, you can buy and trade that pretty easily,” says Vogelsang. This is one reason they only pay a slight premium above the treasury yield, he says, so maybe 6% at today’s rates. If you’re a small business? Vogelsang says that because there are no liquid markets for that loan, your options are scarce and you’d pay 15%. This means you need to charge your customers more money, giving Google a massive advantage.  “Tokenization really changes things,” says Vogelsang. “You level the playing field.” He acknowledges that we’ll never get to a point where Google and the small business pay the same rate -- there’s more risk in lending to a small business than there is to Google -- but creating liquidity helps narrow the gap. “This was the motivation for starting Centrifuge,” says Vogelsang.  Maple’s Sid Powell says something similar. He views the tokenization of RWAs as a way to provide true benefits to ordinary people, which could help the space recover from its reputation of speculation and gambling. “A big narrative thread in RWAs is, how can lending on-chain actually touch real-world businesses, and help them grow?”  Maybe the most popular tokenization project is one we take for granted -- cash. “Cash is being tokenized. It’s called a stablecoin. That’s a real-world asset that’s being replicated on-chain, and is then becoming tradable,” says Pieper. And Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), essentially, are tokenized versions of a central bank currency that exist on a distributed ledger. These would “bring down costs and drastically shorten time-frames for cross border transactions and settlements,” says Barbosa.  The tokenization of cash, which has been happening since Tether launched in 2014, could have global consequences. This leads to what Pedersen calls his “big thought.” He first notes that “The world’s money market is a USD-denominated money market,” and that “all of this dollar-denominated collateral sits in “many different places.” Nobody knows the exact size of it. “Nobody has transparency,” says Pedersen, who describes these pools of dollar-denominated collateral as “completely dark,” so when the system fails it “blows up the world every single time.”  If, instead, the U.S. dollar market is collateral that’s put on the blockchain? “You will start having a world money market that is transparent,” says Pedersen. “Central banks will have an understanding of what’s going on,” which would help avoid the next financial disaster.  These perks of tokenization -- without the downside risk of crypto price speculation -- are why many view their adoption as inevitable. “More and more assets will be tokenized to the point where we’re not delineating between tokenized and non-tokenized assets,” predicts Krupetsky, at Ava Labs.

42410194,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMxW,1689687334,Bitcoin Remains Under Pressure Below $30K Following U.S. Retail Sales Numbers,"Bitcoin's (BTC) price at $29,735 was barely holding above a one-month low after Tuesday morning's economic data confirmed the U.S. economy remains in growth mode and traders brace for what's now a near 100% certainty of another Federal Reserve rate hike next week.  Bitcoin, which appeared set for a major upside price breakout when it rallied as high as $31,800 last week, was recently down 0.7% over the past 24 hours and sits just below its $30,000 support of much of the past month.  Other major cryptos were mixed. Ether, the second largest token by market value was recently trading at $1,893, flat from Monday, same time. XRP, which soared and then sank last week following a favorable court ruling in Ripple's ongoing court case with the SEC, was changing hands at 76 cents, up more than 4%. But ADA, SOL and MATIC, the native cryptos of smart contract platforms Cardano and Solana, were recently off 2%, 3.6% and 5%, respectively.  On its face, the retail sales report from the U.S. Census Bureau for June showed some weakness, with the headline number rising 0.2% last month versus forecasts for 0.5% and May's 0.5%. However, the retail sales ""control group"" – which filters out some components to compile a more precise gauge of consumer spending – rose 0.6% in June, more than double May's pace and far ahead of estimates for a decline of 0.3%.  ""Score another win for team soft landing,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM. He noted that the control group is higher by 2.1% on a 3-month average annualized basis, implying modest upside risk to his team's forecast for 1.7% GDP growth in Q2.  What little doubt about the result of next week's meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been essentially fully erased, with traders now pricing in a 97.3% chance of another 25 basis point rate hike, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.  Equity markets rose amid encouraging second quarter earnings from Bank of America and other major financial services organizations that continued a trend from last week when JP Morgan Chase reported sizable gains in net income and revenues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 both closed up 0.7%.  In an email to CoinDesk, Jake Boyle, director of retail crypto brokerage Caleb & Brown, called the dip below $30,000 ""a natural consolidation.  ""There was perhaps a little too much euphoria following Ripple’s apparent win against the SEC last week, with the court ruling sparking a wall of capital to flow back into the ecosystem,"" Boyle wrote.  But he also noted ""a sentiment shift that will at least keep Bitcoin and a good many other digital assets grinding upwards.""  ""There will be more pullbacks,"" Boyle wrote. ""But the trajectory is clear.

ARK Sells COIN Shares In recent trade disclosures, it has been revealed that funds associated with Cathie Wood's ARK Investment have continued to divest shares of Coinbase Global Inc. and Tesla Inc. On Monday, substantial sales were made where three different ARK exchange-traded funds (ETFs) sold off a total of 24,8838 COIN shares. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) sold 76,788 shares of Coinbase (COIN), while the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) sold 127,266 shares, and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) sold 44,784 shares. Based on Coinbase’s closing price of $105.55 on Monday, the sales brought in approximately $26.3 million. The company has also sold a significant chunk of its Tesla shares (TSLA), again through different funds. The ARK Innovation ETF sold 38,329 Tesla shares, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF sold 6,855 shares, bringing in a total of $13.1 million, based on Tesla’s closing price of $290.38 on Monday. COIN Hits Annual High These sales add to the $50 million worth of Coinbase shares it sold on Friday when the share prices hit a yearly high of $114.43. The investment firm had made significant acquisitions of Coinbase shares during the bear market. As of late, the crypto industry has been going through a much-need rally, with Coinbase stock riding a 52-week high. ARK Investment clearly wants to make the most of this price rally and has therefore chosen to divest a sizeable percentage of its COIN holdings for the second time in less than a week. ARK Swivelling To META? There has been an uptick in the market prices lately, owed partially to the recent crypto-favorable ruling in the SEC vs. Ripple legal battle. The upcoming weeks might experience even stronger rallies. It remains to be seen if Wood decides to cash in further on the moment by divesting all COIN shares. The move to sell COIN shares could also be reflective of Wood’s decision to change up her investment strategy. In fact, following the announcement of Mark Zuckerberg’s Threads, a social media platform similar to Twitter, Wood decided to invest heavily in Meta Platforms. In fact, ARK Innovation ETF has already acquired 69,793 META shares, while ARK Next Generation Internet ETF purchased 12,559 META shares.

Low user numbers and poor on-chain data have severely clouded the outlook. However, a few days ago, there was a surprise that gave a big boost to the SUI price. The SUI network made waves in the crypto space by surpassing its competitor Solana in daily transactions. However, with a sudden record of 29 million transactions in 24 hours, SUI has left many crypto enthusiasts questioning the validity and sustainability of this sudden surge. Renowned analyst and crypto whale Andrew Kang, known for his insightful commentary, has raised concerns about the authenticity of these transactions, suggesting that SUI may be artificially inflating its numbers. Kang writes today: Sui pumping their numbers up. Chart looks good, market does not seem to be discerning about validity of transactions. Fake it til you make it. Is SUI Still Worth Buying? As Kang argues, the question is: Are the numbers legitimate and can drive a sustainable upward trend, or will the hype quickly die down because of fake numbers? Related Reading: SUI Continues Rally As Sui 8192 Web3 Game Fuels Blockchain Activity To Hit New Peak The recent surge in transactions can be primarily attributed to the introduction of the on-chain game, “Sui 8192.” Developed by the team behind the wallet provider, Ethos Wallet, this casual game has captured the attention of users with its gameplay reminiscent of the classic puzzle game “2048.” Each move within the game triggers a transaction, resulting in the state of the game being recorded on the blockchain. With the integration of a pre-approval mechanism in Ethos Wallet, players can optimize their gameplay experience by setting a token amount before each game. It’s Important to know that the SUI Foundation has allocated $5 million to further stimulate activity within the game, offering players the opportunity to earn rewards in the form of SUI tokens by competing against others or completing tasks. However, this could call into question the sustainability of this increase in transaction activity. Related Reading: Sui Foundation Refutes Claims Of Dumping Locked Staking Rewards On Binance Perhaps the game is only experiencing a short hype at the moment because players want to grab the free tokens. Once the marketing budget is exhausted, the hype could quickly be over. SUI traders and investors should therefore be cautious. Prior to this transaction surge, the project had been marred by negative headlines, including allegations of suspicious token movements, concerns about venture capital influence, and opaque tokenomics. These controversies have left some investors wary of the project’s long-term prospects. Price Analysis However, as stated by Kang, the SUI chart looks promising at the moment. The price has broken out of the downward trend that existed since the mainnet launch. The bulls also managed to defend the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level in a retest. Currently, the price is contending with the 38.2% retracement level at $0.76. If it manages to break above this resistance, $0.84 and $0.92 could be the next price target.

The headline guest for Ethcon 2023 is Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, who will appear with a keynote address highlighting the latest in Ethereum development updates, as well as the future roadmap of the project. The Ethereum Foundation has been supporting Ethcon since its first edition in 2019, recognizing the importance of diffusing knowledge in the developer community. Due to the non-commercial nature of the event, the Foundation’s support is critical to maintaining Ethcon as the premier developer conference in Korea, which is fully volunteer-driven, with local community members dedicating their time pro-bono to organize and run the event. Spanning three days from September 1 to September 3, 2023, it immediately precedes the anticipated Korea Blockchain Week 2023, a Web3 conference organized by FactBlock and Hashed, running from September 4 to September 10. As a developer-focused conference, Ethcon Korea 2023 will primarily feature developers from across the globe and local to South Korea, who will show insightful research results and innovative projects to benefit Ethereum and the Web3 space as a whole. The event will run alongside an exciting three-day hackathon, which will bring together developer talent to work on interesting new projects and research, which they will then have the opportunity to present at a live-streamed demo day at the event’s close. True to the community spirit, the Hackathon will use Quadratic Funding, a democratic public good funding and evaluation method, conceptualized by Vitalik and first pioneered in practice by Gitcoin. Quadratic Funding is a weighted voting and resource allocation method, which will combine votes from judges, sponsors and attendees to participate in the selection based on their contribution. Quadratic Funding is designed to combine community support for new ideas with the interests of larger contributors in a synergistic process. Ethcon Korea is accepting submissions for proposals and talks until July 18, aiming to foster a diverse background of active researchers and lesser known developers, with the key goal of sharing useful experiences with each other. The event will be held at Platz2 (플라츠2) in Seoul, a cozy and spacious co-working space in the middle of Seoul. About Ethcon Korea 2023 Ethcon is an annual developer-focused conference and hackathon held in Seoul, South Korea. As the largest developer event in the country, it brings together global and local talent to discuss exciting new research and development in the Ethereum ecosystem.

42410179,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMJq,1689685548,"G20 Nations Welcome FSB's Tougher Crypto Rules, Says Presidency Holder India","The Group of Twenty (G20) welcomed the high-level recommendations of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) on crypto asset activities and global stablecoin arrangements, said Nirmala Sitharaman, Finance Minister of India, which currently holds the G20 presidency, during a press conference on Tuesday.  On Monday, international standard-setter FSB called for tougher rules on safeguarding crypto clients’ assets and avoiding conflicts of interest, after multiple allegations of bad behavior emerged during crypto’s recent turbulent year. The recommendations follow a consultation in which traditional finance companies pushed for stronger crypto controls, while the likes of Binance and Coinbase have warned that tougher rules could constrain innovation.  Stablecoin regulation is a sticking point between the Group of Seven (G7) and the G20, CoinDesk has previously reported, but Sitharaman said the G20 welcomes the FSB's recommendations for oversight over stablecoins.  The announcement was made after the third Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors meeting held during India's presidency in eastern India's Gandhinagar, Gujarat over the past few days.  India's presidency note on crypto was also presented in discussions that stretched late into Monday night, said Sitharaman. It isn't clear what the note said precisely but local reports have said the note was expected to summarize the work that has been done by various countries and institutions.  “Members also discussed the presidency note that India had prepared and noted that it would be an important input towards prioritizing areas of work essential for achieving a comprehensive cohesive and coordinated global policy and regulatory framework,"" said Sitharaman.  In addition to the FSB recommendations, the G20 will be presented a joint synthesis paper of the FSB and International Monetary Fund (IMF) that focuses on the global macro implications of crypto in September. That's when the position of the G20 on crypto during India's presidency will be finalized.  India’s central bank governor Shaktikanta Das said a Jan. 2023 paper from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), which includes crypto bans as a policy option alongside regulation, reflects “huge risks” in crypto, something “we have been saying” for years.  Das also spoke to the G20’s discussions on central bank digital currency (CBDC), saying that there has been a ""perceptible change in thinking … that CBDC is an important aspect which needs to be looked at more seriously.""  ""It was also recognized that there is great potential for CBDC to facilitate easier, smooth and seamless cross border transactions and cross border payments, and there's a need to take this agenda forward,"" Das said, adding that digital versions of fiat ""will mean a fundamental change in the currency system.""  Central banks around the world are studying the issue, and a recent study by the Bank for International Settlements found around 15 retail CBDCs are likely to be in circulation by 2030.

42410187,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMX4,1689685200,Crypto Insurer Evertas Buys Bitcoin Mining Cover Specialist Bitsure,"Evertas, one of the few cryptocurrency insurance providers to work with the Lloyd’s of London market, has acquired Bitsure, a specialist insurer of Bitcoin mining operations, for an undisclosed amount.  As part of the deal, Bitsure co-founder and president Thomas Shewchuck joins Evertas as head of underwriting.  Crypto companies have found insurance products thin on the ground in recent years as underwriters and issuers struggle to get their heads around the unique characteristics of digital assets.  Bucking that trend, Evertas, which asked Bitsure to be its dedicated mining policy underwriter earlier this year, has received authority from Bermuda-based Arch Insurance to offer mining policies of up to $200 million per location. (Bitsure previously had authority to write policies of just $5 million per location.) Back in December, bitcoin mining and hosting company Compass Mining said it had created a $75m insurance policy for mining equipment  Providing insurance for the specialized equipment used to mine bitcoin might seem similar to the straightforward type of property-risk cover for data centers and the like, said Evertas CEO J. Gdanski. But a lingering fear of crypto generally, combined with several variables that affect the value of mining rigs, make it a poorly understood risk, Gdanski said.  “Of all the crypto risks this is probably the most familiar to the conventional insurance market,” Gdanski told CoinDesk. “Still, there’s so much variability in the pricing of mining hardware due to the fact that its replacement value is based on the value of the asset that's being mined. That does present unique and novel challenges, and that’s why it’s hard for other insurers to get comfortable with it.”  The value of crypto mining equipment, based on future cash flow over the next several years, is also affected by mining difficulty: More miners on the network mean fewer bitcoin awards since it’s a zero-sum game, Shewchuck, Evertas' new head of underwriting, said.  “As the bear market continues and we go into the halving, margins continue to get crushed for miners,” he said in an interview. “When it’s not possible to mine profitably, people turn their rigs off and often just sell them at a discount to larger players. This means more equipment in fewer locations, which increases the risk.”  See also: Bitcoin Halving Is Coming and Only the Most Efficient Miners Will Survive",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/18/crypto-insurer-evertas-buys-bitcoin-mining-cover-specialist-bitsure,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/14326e80e965d7da2dfb227d93379d0677984bdf-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42410201,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUNKf,1689685102,First Mover Americas: Reddit Community’s MOON Tokens Soar,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  Moons (MOON), the native token of Reddit's r/CryptoCurrency community of over 6.5 million users, has chalked up a triple-digit percentage price gain this week. One analyst cited Reddit's recent change in terms of service as a possible reason for the impressive price rally, which has seen MOON's price has surging 170% to almost 25 cents from 9 cents, according to data tracked by Coingecko. The cryptocurrency is listed on SushiSwap, Gate.io and MEXC. Moons are ERC-20 tokens distributed as rewards to users for their posts or comments in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. The coins can be freely traded, tipped, or spent in the community for different purposes. The tokens can also be stored in Reddit's Ethereum-based wallet, called Vault. The Bricks (BRICK) token, distributed as a reward for contributions in the r/Fortnite subreddit, has surged 300% in two days.  Investors were reminded of Coinbase’s (COIN) significant regulatory challenges after the crypto exchange late Friday disclosed it had suspended retail staking services in four of the 10 states that say its staking offerings represent securities, investment bank Berenberg said in a research report. While a U.S. District Court last week ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is not a security in and of itself, it also said that XRP can be classified a security when used in certain transactions, the report said. “Coinbase Earn, the securitized product through which COIN offers staking rewards to retail customers, appears particularly vulnerable to being defined as a security within this context,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  Bankrupt crypto lender Celsius, its creditors and its Series B funding round shareholders have agreed on a settlement to distribute $25 million from the proceeds of the sale of GK8, with $24 million allocated for legal expenses and $1 million to be distributed amongst the group. Self-custody platform GK8 was sold to Galaxy Digital as part of Celsius’ bankruptcy proceedings, and while the exact details of the sale were not disclosed, Galaxy spokesman Michael Wursthorn earlier told CoinDesk that the price was significantly less than the $115 million Celsius bought it for. The bankrupt crypto lender closed a $750 million Series B funding round in November 2021. Growth equity firm Westcap and one of Quebec’s pension funds led the round, which was oversubscribed, expanding the raise from $400 million to $750 million.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows changes in XRP's liquidity, measured by a collection of buy and sell offers within 1% of the mid-price or the average of the bid and the ask/offer prices.  The depth has held steady at around 25 million XRP since the beginning of the year.  ""If this liquidity was to see any severe drops, it would likely indicate the risk of holding inventory on the books in case the SEC was to win, causing negative price action and a potential swathe of delistings on exchanges,"" CCData said in a report on Friday, calling the liquidity a good indicator of perceived regulatory risk of market-making on XRP pairs.  Liquidity refers to the ability of the market to absorb large buy/sell orders at stable prices.

On July 20, the Chainlink protocol will become available to developers across the four blockchains’ testnets and also Arbitrum’s Goerli. As a result of this, the price of Chainlink’s native token, LINK, rallied nearly 10% to touch $7.30 following this announcement on Monday. Chainlink’s CCIP – The Future Of Interoperability? In a blog post dated July 17, Chainlink announced the launch of the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol to early access users on Avalanche, Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon blockchains. While DeFi lending protocol Aave is set to integrate the protocol, it has already been adopted on the derivatives platform Synthetix. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Needs To Clear $30,500 For Hopes of a Fresh Rally According to the post, CCIP is an interoperability protocol that allows developers to design their own cross-chain solutions. It also offers “Simplified Token Transfers”, which allows protocols to swiftly send tokens across chains through audited token pool contracts. Chainlink claims that CCIP is a blockchain layer designed to foster a connection between enterprises and any public or private blockchain ecosystem. The cross-chain protocol is a collaborative effort with Swift, the renowned global financial messaging network. It leverages Swift’s messaging infrastructure to facilitate token transfers across various public and private blockchains. According to Chainlink’s co-founder Sergey Nazarov, CCIP is a solution that aims to “connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.” He also stated that such technology will be crucial to developing and maintaining a blockchain-powered society. Just like key standards such as TCP/IP remade a fragmented early internet into the single global internet we all know and use today, we are making CCIP to connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank chain ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.… https://t.co/BDMFMfknY2 pic.twitter.com/DDscglD2An — Sergey Nazarov (@SergeyNazarov) July 17, 2023 Some of the financial institutions and enterprises also exploring the Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ), BNP Paribas, BNY Mellon, Citi, Euroclear, and Lloyds Banking Group.

The numbers don’t improve if you compare the first half of 2023 to the same period in 2022. In 2022, Web3 startups raised nearly $16 billion in the first half of the year, but this year’s fundraises have totaled just $3.6 billion — a 78% drop.  Web3 was defined by Crunchbase as cryptocurrency and blockchain startups, which have been hit hard by the ongoing crypto winter. While VC funding has slowed overall, with Crunchbase reporting an 18% drop across all sectors in the second quarter of 2023, crypto-related funding has had a much steeper decline. Meanwhile artificial-intelligence (AI) startups have become the new shiny object for investors, seeing $25 billion in funding in the first half of 2023.  There were still some significant funding rounds in the first half of 2023. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, saw success with his crypto project Worldcoin, which got $115 million in a Series C round in May 2023 led by Blockchain Capital. Another company managing a 9-figure funding round was crypto protocol LayerZero, which raised $120 million backed by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Christie’s and others.  Even as funding levels off, many prominent firms remain positive on the future of Web3, with a16z highlighting the strength of the sector in its second annual “State of Crypto” report, which noted Web3 gaming especially as showing strength.  In June, the firm was part of a $37 million round backing Mythical Games along with ARK Invest and Animoca Brands. Mythical Games had just announced their NFL Rivals app had passed 1 million downloads shortly before the fundraising announcement.  Binance Labs, the VC arm of the crypto exchange, is similarly still optimistic about Web3, and noted an interest in funding companies that bridge the transition between Web2 and Web3, especially in gaming.

42410188,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMgz,1689681600,Digital Art Platform Prohibition Taps Arbitrum to Democratize Generative Art,"Web3 innovation studio VenturePunk is rolling out Prohibition, a Arbitrum-based generative art platform and marketplace.  The inaugural collection for the platform is “Monospatial” by generative artist Emily Edelman, which features a series of generative non-fungible token (NFT) lettered designs. The collection will open for sale Tuesday afternoon with a supply of 100 tokens at a mint price of 0.05 ETH, or roughly $95 at press time.  Backed by investors including Erick Calderon (aka Snowfro), CEO of generative art platform Art Blocks, and Devin Finzer, CEO of marketplace OpenSea, Prohibition allows any artist to create, mint and sell a generative art collection.  See Also: Who Are the 81 Recipients of Snowfro’s Latest Squiggle Mint?  Using the Art Blocks Engine, a tool built by Art Blocks to bring generative art on-chain, artists can code their designs on Prohibition to mint their collections on Arbitrum, which is an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain. Additionally, buyers can explore and purchase other generative art collections through Prohibition’s native secondary marketplace.  Jordan Lyall, founder and CEO of VenturePunk and former DeFi Product Lead at Web3 infrastructure firm ConsenSys told CoinDesk that as generative art has become increasingly popular in the past year, its barriers to entry have become increasingly high. Not only is it rare to find a code-savvy artist who can rise to the ranks of popular creators Tyler Hobbs or Dmitri Cherniak, but it’s also hard for artists to be selected to mint their work on a platform in the first place. According to Lyall, Art Blocks only works with 2% of the artists that apply to create a collection.  In releasing Prohibition, he aims to recreate the early days of creating and trading generative art on Ethereum by breaking down the barriers and inviting all artists to mint.  “It doesn't matter what you know, where you come from, what your background is, where in the world you live – anyone can use our tools to create generative art,” said Lyall. “We really think that if Art Blocks is HBO, Prohibition is YouTube where anybody can upload [their work.]”  Lyall added that in choosing a network to support, Arbitrum made the most sense for its “90-95% savings in gas fees,” compared to Ethereum, which may cost several ether for a creator to deploy an entire collection on-chain.  Additionally, implementing the Art Blocks Engine into the platform – which companies including Web3 fashion brand 9dcc and NFT gallery Bright Moments have similarly done – helps ease the minting process, making generative art creation accessible for artists.  “We're the first to take these Art Block Engine protocols and open them up for everybody, so anybody can use these tools,” said Lyall. “And not only that, we're the first Art Blocks Engine partner to redesign the artist experience.”  Edelman, who's work has previously been curated by Art Blocks, is bullish on Prohibition's mission to level the playing field for creators and buyers entering the growing generative art ecosystem.  ""I’m so proud to have my project, Monospatial, as project #0 on Prohibition,"" said Edelman. ""I hugely believe in this platform built for accessibility and ease, experiments and inventions, artists and collectors, ALL of us.""  Lyall added that in the coming months, he plans to add features to ease the minting process on Prohibition further, including a match-making service that helps pair developers with artists to produce collections, as well as a no-code solution for artists to bring their work to life.  In November, VenturePunk raised $1.5 million in pre-seed funding to build out Prohibition. In addition to Calderon and Finzer, it received capital from investment firm Bain Capital Crypto and Ethereum sidechain Polygon’s venture wing Polygon Ventures.  Additionally, Prohibition isn’t the only platform that’s recently implemented the Art Blocks Engine. In June, 279-year-old auction house Sotheby’s announced its plans to utilize the Art Blocks Engine to fuel its own generative art program.

One notable addition is the on-chain blocking feature, which allows Lens users to block each other, similar to Twitter's. Once blocked, users will be restricted from commenting, following, quote-commenting, and utilizing unique crypto-specific features such as mirror and collect. New Features To Support Monetization With monetization as one of the key pillars supporting the V2 upgrade, several new features have been geared toward allowing users to generate revenue. For example, the “collect” feature allows users to accumulate and store content on Lens as NFTs. There is also an equivalent feature to that of a retweet - Mirror. A “mirrored” piece of content will generate revenue, with users who have mirrored the content also receiving a portion of the earnings. According to the statement from Aave founder Stani Kulechov, ""Lens Protocol V2 takes decentralized social media and monetization opportunities to a new leve. Providing maximum flexibility for builders, V2 enables new types of social engagements and monetization relationships, where all stakeholders can share in the value of social networks—both individually and collectively as an ecosystem."" V2 Continues Open Design Space Although the initial iteration of the social platform did not include a user interface, it had sufficient tools and supportive architecture for developers to build their own consumer apps in the Lens ecosystem. As a result, numerous social media apps stemmed from the platform, like Lenster, Orb, and Buttrfly. Furthermore, the developer community on the platform has also created multiple tools like algorithms that predict follower growth to search operations to find new friends and content. This characteristic open design space will continue on V2, allowing developers to execute external actions directly on the platform and build innovative projects. The recent introduction of the Momoka data scalability solution and V2’s Lens Improvement Proposals (LIPs) will further enhance the platform’s scalability and decentralization. Profiles Get An Upgrade The latest iteration of the web3 social app is also focusing on upgrading the profiles themselves. Since V2 has transitioned the profiles to the ERC-6551 standard from the previous ERC-721, they now function like crypto wallets, allowing users to transact and store cryptocurrencies along with NFTs. Lens Protocol is also delving deeper into crypto-native actions, like creating pathways for builders to join DAOs or directly donate to public goods through investing in content. With these new features and improvements, Lens Protocol V2 seeks to carve out its niche in the social media landscape, providing users with a decentralized and crypto-powered platform that offers increased engagement, monetization opportunities, and compatibility with the evolving web3 ecosystem.

On July 13, Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP doesn’t qualify as a security leading to a massive price surge in which the token gained by almost 90%. However, while it may appear that XRP’s positive effect on the market is waning, with most assets slipping into a bearish state, there is still a high level of interest surrounding this altcoin, proven by a recent report from prominent crypto exchange Bitrue. Bitrue Users Accumulate $800M Worth Of XRP In Futures Market. In the late hours of yesterday, a crypto analyst with the Twitter handle @cowboycrypto313 revealed that Bitrue had shared a report via email with its users, noting a massive increase in the notional value of the open interest of the XRP token. Related Reading: XRP Price Retreats After Massive 80% Rally, Buy The Dips? The notional value of open interest refers to the total value of outstanding contracts in a futures or optional market. In this context, it represents the total value of XRP on the Bitrue exchange based on what its traders have pledged to buy or sell in the future. In this report, Bitrue states that XRP holdings in its Futures service spiked from less than $200 million to over $800 million during the weekend. Interestingly, the exchange further revealed that 88% of its users are holding a long position on this asset. According to a chart shared by Bitrue, the notional value of open interest for XRP on its platform had been below $200 million for the majority of the last two weeks. However, following the court ruling on July 13, this index started rising, with the XRP Futures market recording a notable spike on July 16. Source: Twitter XRP Soars By 57% In Seven Days In other news, XRP remains the center of the crypto market attention, recording a 56.73% gain in the last week, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Currently, XRP, which now ranks as the fourth-biggest cryptocurrency, is tagged biggest weekly gainer. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this token has shown little to no price movement in the last few days, with its price hovering around the $0.74 region.

42410189,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUMaN,1689678400,Even Unpaid Social Media Crypto Promotions May Breach UK Ad Rules: Financial Regulator,"Unpaid social media influencers fall within the scope of U.K. financial advertising rules and may be breaking the law if they fail to get appropriate approval, according to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which gained oversight of crypto promotions with the approval of the Financial Services and Markets Act at the end of June.  Influencers who are not paid directly by the firm, but post online with the hope of being hired later or to acquire more views for themselves fall within the scope of promotion rules alongside those who do get paid, the FCA said in a consultation on social media advertising rules for the financial industry on Monday.  If they communicate financial promotions without approval of an authorized person, they are likely to be ""communicating an illegal financial promotion,"" the FCA said. Influencers who fall within the scope of the FCA rules would need to make sure that their promotions are fair and not misleading. Even memes, often images with superimposed text that are copied and reused across users' accounts, could count as financial promotions, according to the consultation document.  Even before the FCA's involvement, social media crypto promoters found themselves under the microscope. Last year, Jessica and Eve Gale – former contestants on the U.K. reality show Love Island – were told to stop misleading their Instagram followers with pro-crypto posts by the Advertising Standards Authority, the ad industry's self-regulatory organization.  The FCA published its promotion rules for the crypto sector in June, setting out that promoting products using financial incentives like airdrops would be banned and stating that crypto companies needed clear risk warnings with their ads. Registered crypto companies will be allowed to approve their own ads for a limited time once the new financial promotions regime comes into force in October.

But since mid of June, fueled by the excitement surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock, Bitcoin has seen a significant increase of over 27%. Solana is even up 75%. However, the macroeconomic outlook as well as the typical summer lethargy providing reasons for skepticism and restraint. Technically, Bitcoin seems to work to win a Bollinger Band Squeeze. Our ""high for the year"" target remains USD 48,550, and we remain cautiously bullish. Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) price action in the last four weeks has been characterized by consolidation and a lack of decisive movement. The market is eagerly anticipating a breakout, and the next significant price direction will likely depend on factors such as market sentiment, macroeconomic trends, and potential catalysts within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. However, caution is still advised, as external factors such as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments, and market sentiment will influence Bitcoin's price trajectory. Review Since hitting a low of USD 24,756 on June 15th, Bitcoin as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have experienced a significant increase of over 27% fueled by the excitement surrounding a potential Bitcoin ETF by BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager. At its peak, prices reached USD 31,850, the highest level in over 12 months. However, those who missed the initial nine days of this sharp rally in mid-June are now facing a three-week sideways consolidation. Despite repeated attempts, Bitcoin has been unable to break through its resistance zone between USD 30,750 and USD 31,850. Instead it has pulled back slightly on Friday. Solana in USD, weekly chart as of July 15th, 2023 (Tradingview) Solana (SOL-USD) has seen an even more impressive surge, gaining over 75% since mid-June. The bear market and the FTX debacle had a significant impact on the blockchain project last year, causing its coin to crash 97%. However, it now appears that the worst is behind Solana, and it is gradually establishing its relevance, much like Ethereum did in 2019. Recently, there was a noteworthy inflow of over USD 1 billion in a single trading day, potentially indicating institutional investors positioning themselves as Solana may play an important role in the Web3 and DeFi sector in the medium to long term. Hence, in a new crypto bull market, Solana likely has a significantly greater upside potential in terms of price performance compared to Ethereum (ETH-USD). Technical Analysis for Bitcoin in US-Dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart - Breaking out above USD 31,800 would be the next logical step. Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of July 15th, 2023 (Tradingview) On the weekly chart, Bitcoin forcefully broke out of its corrective flag pattern . Since that significant green breakout candle, prices have been hovering around the upper edge of the resistance zone between USD 30,750 and USD 31,800. A successful breakout would likely result in a rapid ascent towards the upper Bollinger Band (USD 32,500), the upper trend channel boundary (approximately USD 33,500), and subsequently the 38.2% retracement level at USD 35,924. Reaching this 38.2% retracement around USD 36,000 would mark the completion of the minimum recovery or bounce in response to last year's bear-market. It would not be surprising if Bitcoin would then take a breather in that range between USD 35,000 and USD 37,000. Additionally, the overbought condition indicated by the weekly Stochastic oscillator suggests that pushing even higher will not be an easy task. Rally Directly Towards USD 48,555? Alternatively, the rally may continue directly, with the bulls potentially gaining further momentum. In order to inflict the maximum amount of pain on latecomers, they must be denied any opportunity to join the moving train with a reasonably favorable risk/reward ratio. Our overall target remains the 61.8% retracement at USD 48,555. With some luck, Bitcoin may even reach the psychological level of USD 50,000. However, we do not expect much more for Bitcoin this year. Instead, after reaching the 61.8% retracement, we anticipate a significant pullback, potentially leading to medium-term prices around or below USD 30,000 and possibly even around or below USD 25,000. In summary, the weekly chart is bullish, and a rise towards USD 35,000 to USD 37,000 would be the next logical step. Temporary pullbacks should hold above USD 28,500. However, the anticipated breakout above USD 31,500 could generate enough momentum to catapult Bitcoin directly towards the major resistance zone between USD 45,000 and USD 50,000. Bitcoin Daily Chart - Bollinger Band Squeeze is developing. Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of July 15th, 2023 (Tradingview) On the daily chart, the price action has been confined within a tight range primarily between approximately USD 30,000 and USD 30,800 for the past 22 trading days. Occasional spikes to the upside and downside have been quickly contained. Thanks to this prolonged period of sideways movement, the Bollinger Bands have also been moving sideways or in parallel. We suspect that a Bollinger Band Squeeze is developing here. This occurs when volatility diminishes, and the two bands contract or narrow. Eventually, a breakout from the sideways band indicates the beginning of the next trending move, which, given the accumulated energy, can have explosive characteristics. After countless attempts by the bulls to breach the resistance zone around USD 31,500 since mid-April, a breakout above it would indeed initiate a strong up-trending move. The active buy signal from the Stochastic indicator is also positive in this context. Overall, the daily chart is bullish. However, it may still take another week or two until enough energy has built up for a breakout to the upside. On the downside, Bitcoin has strong support around USD 30,000 already. Hence, the ""worst-case scenario"" currently suggests a decline towards the swiftly rising 50-day moving average at around USD 28,585. Sentiment Bitcoin - Market Participants are Regaining Confidence Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of July 12th, 2023 (Lookintobitcoin) Thanks to the significantly increased Bitcoin prices, the sentiment in the crypto sector has greatly improved, too. The ""Crypto Fear & Greed Index"" has risen from 47 to the current level of 64 over the past four weeks. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of July 12th, 2023 (Lookintobitcoin) Overall, the sentiment recovery is continuing. However, extreme greed, high euphoria, and excessive optimism are not evident. Hence, from a sentiment perspective, there is still plenty of room for Bitcoin's rally to continue upwards. Seasonality Bitcoin - Unfavorable Seasonality Since Mid-June Seasonality for Bitcoin, as of July 12th, 2023 (Seasonax) The seasonal pattern for Bitcoin has been negative since mid-June, posing a clear obstacle to the bullish ambitions. However, things do change over time. Additionally, markets do not adhere to their seasonal statistics approximately two out of ten years. Therefore, the negative seasonal signal should not be overemphasized. It is worth noting, however, that statistically speaking, Bitcoin tends to exhibit weakness until October based on the data from the past ten years. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of July 15th, 2023 (Tradingview) Gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) prices likely reached their typical early summer low around USD 1,893 two weeks ago and are expected to target the resistance zone around USD 2,075 again in the next one to three months. The breakout to new all-time highs (our first target being USD 2,525) could potentially occur in the third or fourth quarter 2023. On the other hand, Bitcoin is currently consolidating its strong surge from the second half of June and is eyeing a breakout above USD 31,800 in the short term. At prices of around USD 30,350 for one Bitcoin and USD 1,955 for one ounce of gold, one currently needs to pay about 15.52 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin. Conversely, one ounce of gold currently costs approximately 0.064 Bitcoin. Overall, Bitcoin (+82.85%) remains the faster horse as it has clearly outperformed gold (+6.64%) by a factor of 12.4 since the beginning of the year. Looking back, as expected four weeks ago, the Bitcoin/Gold-ratio has significantly increased and has surpassed our interim target of 15. If Bitcoin does break out above USD31,800 and continues to rise, ratio values between 17.5 and 21.5 are possible in the second half of the year. If Bitcoin does reach our year-end target of USD 48,550 and gold would simultaneously rise to USD 2,525, the ratio would be at 19.22, which is 23.65% higher than the current level. Macro Update - When Will the Next Rescue Action Become Necessary? U.S. inflation data, as of July 12, 2023 (Holger Zschäpitz) The U.S. inflation data, released last Wednesday, indicated a further slowdown in both core and headline inflation in June. On a year-on-year basis, the headline price index slowed to +3%, while the core price index fell to ""only"" +4.8%. Overall, the data came in lower than expected, fueling hopes that the FED would end its rate hikes. The FED had recently paused its rate hikes but continued to maintain a restrictive and hawkish tone. U.S. inflation data, as of July 12, 2023 (Holger Zschäpitz) It is possible that both, the markets, and the FED, initially underestimated the rise as well as now the slump in inflation. U.S. yield curve, as of July 2, 2023 (Jurrien Timmer, Fidelity) While the equity markets have been pulled up by just a few mega tech stocks for months now, however, the yield curve is increasingly screaming recession. In any case, however, the FED wants to keep withdrawing liquidity from the markets! Surplus liquidity plus the ""Bank Term Funding Program"" have so far prevented worse Only the surplus liquidity of the last 15 years, which has been wafting in the financial system, together with the hastily knitted rescue package in March (Bank Term Funding Program = BTFP) have so far presumably prevented worse. In any case, commodity prices have been rather weak for months, with the oil price in particular having corrected significantly since June 2022. At the moment, however, oil looks like it has successfully bottomed out, so that there is hardly any further support coming from that side in combating inflation. At the same time, the BRICS+ countries are working on a new gold standard, while the war in Ukraine continues, escalating the East/West conflict, and unfortunately, the warmongers still hold sway on both sides. Overall, this presents a very complex and less favorable macro dataset, which initially calls for caution or a defensive approach. Although stock markets tend to weaken in the summer and especially in September, we currently do not see any crash risks though. Next stress case is foreseeable However, we expect the stress caused by the brutal interest rate hikes and the restrictive stance of the US central bank to return to the markets later this year. Nevertheless, the FED will flip just as quickly as it did in March and announce new liquidity programs and rescue measures in no time because the Western financial system probably cannot withstand a multi-month, let alone multi-year bear market. Currency will have to be created out of thin air again in some form. The main thing is to disguise and package it in a way that the public doesn't smell a rat. Bitcoin correlation with S&P500, as of June 30th, 2023 (Dan Morehead, Pantera Capital) Those who want to protect themselves and their wealth from this irresponsible monetary policy must turn to precious metals and Bitcoin. So far this year, Bitcoin has outperformed all other investments, defying the rise in real interest rates. The potential spot ETF from BlackRock has recently fueled new excitement in the crypto sector. Additionally, the correlation between Bitcoin and the stock market (S&P 500) has dropped to zero. Since a blockchain is not linked to interest rates, it should also exhibit very low correlation with major asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, which are all heavily influenced by interest rates. Overall, the macro environment for Bitcoin is extremely favorable in the medium to long term. In the coming months, any stress in the financial system could temporarily put Bitcoin prices under pressure once again. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Breakout to the Upside is Most Likely After trading sideways at high levels for the past three weeks, we must consider a forthcoming upward breakout from a technical perspective. A potential ""Bollinger Band Squeeze"" could rapidly propel prices towards USD 35,000. Our target range for this year remains at USD 45,000 to USD 50,000. Currently, we anticipate a significant pullback only after reaching this region, which may also extend over a period of time. Despite the macroeconomic outlook and the typical summer lethargy providing reasons for skepticism and restraint, we remain cautiously optimistic and expect that the financial markets will soon begin pricing in an interest rate cut by the FED. As financial markets usually look six to eight months ahead, the much-discussed ""FED pivot"" could become a reality by the end of this year or in the first quarter of 2024.",POSITIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617734-bitcoin-breakout-to-the-upside-most-likely?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15025258.jpeg

15024654,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/07/litecoin-halving-is-fast-approaching,1689676334,Litecoin halving is fast approaching,"The crypto world eagerly awaits as Litecoin's third halving event approaches. Expected for August 2, 2023, this event will occur once the 2,520,000th block is mined. What is the halving? A “halving” in the crypto context refers to the moment when the reward miners receive for validating transactions on the blockchain is cut by half. This means that miners will earn half the number of new coins for each block they mine, which, in the past, has significantly impacted the cryptocurrency's value. The event has historically triggered significant movements in Litecoin's value, often preceding similar movements in Bitcoin. This has led some to speculate that Litecoin's performance could be a precursor to Bitcoin's future movements. Halving expectations Litecoin's halving occurs approximately every 840,000 blocks, which takes around four years. Since its inception in 2011, Litecoin has already experienced two halvings. During these events, the rewards given to miners are reduced, which has led to an increase in Litecoin's value. Historical data from previous halvings in various cryptocurrencies may serve as a basis for this expectation. However, sceptics argue that market participants are already aware of the halving event and have factored it into their price calculations and strategies. In this view, the halving’s effects may have been “priced in” ahead of time, meaning that any potential price impact has already been reflected in the current market value. As we approach the third halving event, it’s reasonable to expect increased market attention and potential price volatility. Holders and potential investors will be keeping a close eye on Litecoin as it approaches and then passes the halving. Will the halving push Litecoin higher this time? Many Litecoin holders will hope that this next halving will help to provide the spark that pulls LItecoin out of its current range bound price action. Right now, it appears that Litecoin has in fact managed to turn an incredibly important resistance at $91 into support. Sitting just above the 50 and 200 day moving averages should also provide a reliable cushion. A lift off for Litecoin from here could take it to the next strong resistance at $140.

While the U.S. District Court ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is not a security in and of itself last week, it also ruled that XRP can be classified a security when used in certain transactions, the report said.  “Coinbase Earn, the securitized product through which COIN offers staking rewards to retail customers, appears particularly vulnerable to being defined as a security within this context,” analysts led by Mark Palmer wrote.  Berenberg notes that staking was one of the topics of discussion last Thursday during the first pre-motion hearing in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Coinbase.  “The commission’s arguments could gain support if any or all of the 10 states that initiated proceedings against COIN for operating an illegal staking program affirm that the program facilitates securities offerings,” the report added.

Following Judge Netburn’s order, several members of the XRP community have speculated that both parties will settle soon. New Settlement Order The order came shortly after Judge Analisa Torres of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York referred the next phase of the court proceedings in the Ripple vs. SEC suit to Judge Netburn. Court documents filed on the 17th of July reveal that Judge Netburn will be presiding over the General Pretrial. The judge indicated that the concerned parties reach an agreement regarding settlement dates 6-8 weeks beforehand, pointing to the court’s hectic schedule. The judge’s order stated that the parties involved in the matter must agree to three mutually convenient dates. “NEW: Judge Sarah Netburn orders both @Ripple and the @SECGov to agree on 3 mutually convenient dates to schedule a settlement conference, “if they believe it to be productive at this time.” Also recommends scheduling 6-8 weeks beforehand due to the court’s busy schedule.” The order also stated that the court would not agree to or tolerate any last-second requests for settlement conferences and also told the parties not to expect any adjournments on litigation deadlines. Do Ripple And The SEC Want To Settle? The pretrial phase includes aspects of the matter pertaining to scheduling, discovery, and non-dispositive pretrial motions. It is also the stage when most parties in a case would look to settle instead of going to trial. While many believe that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission would want Ripple to settle, the coming few days will reveal if either side wishes to take the settlement route. Eleanor Terrett, business journalist at Fox, shared her outlook, stating that Judge Netburn’s order does not mean a settlement would occur within the next 6 to 8 weeks, noting that the order only pertains to the parties scheduling a settlement conference. “To be clear: Judge Netburn is suggesting that both sides agree on some possible dates for a settlement meeting, *IF* “they believe it to be productive at this time. This doesn’t mean we’ll see a settlement in 6-8 weeks. It means that if they do decide on a date, it will have to be scheduled 6-8 weeks in advance of the desired date due to the court’s busy schedule.” She also added that both sides could also refuse to schedule a settlement conference or fail to reach an agreement within the stipulated time frame. Terrett has been following the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit since the beginning of the case. Pro-XRP Lawyer Believes Conference Will Be Scheduled Pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli stated that he believes that Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission will schedule the settlement conference in a bid to avoid angering the court. However, he also stated that the conference would end just like how the previous meetings ended, with both sides failing to reach a compromise acceptable to each other. “They will likely schedule one so as not to anger the court. But it will go about as well as the last two settlement conferences before it went. Settlement only happens when both parties finally reach the compromise each can stomach.” If what Rispoli believes would play out, then one or both parties could also appeal Judge Torres’ summary decision. In a landmark ruling, Judge Torres effectively stated that XRP was not a security, triggering a massive rally for the token and the larger crypto market. While the outcome of the case is still up in the air, market watchers believe that Ripple’s partial victory is a critical moment and could help in formulating much-needed regulatory clarity in the US crypto markets. Reacting to the judgment, the Securities and Exchange Commission stated at the time that it was still assessing the order and would identify its next course of action.

42410197,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUNE3,1689673184,Bitcoin Cannot Remain Indifferent to Dollar Index for Long: Analyst,"Bitcoin's (BTC) negative correlation with the U.S. dollar index (DXY) has broken in recent weeks, with the top cryptocurrency struggling to gather upside traction amid continued sell-off in the greenback. The situation, however, may not last long, per one observer.  The dollar index, which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major global fiat currencies, fell 2.26% last week its worst performance since November. The index dropped below 100.00, hitting the lowest since April last year.  Still, bitcoin traded primarily between $30,000 and $32,000, extending the multi-week consolidation, even as equities, including meme stocks, rallied.  ""The negative relationship between DXY and BTC is likely to return, as gyrations in the dollar index influence global liquidity conditions, which in turn affect valuations in risk assets, including cryptocurrencies,"" according to Noelle Acheson, author of Crypto is Macro Now newsletter and former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis.  The dollar is a global reserve currency, playing an outsized role in global trade, international debt, and non-bank borrowing. When the greenback rallies, those with dollar borrowings face higher debt servicing costs and scale-back exposure to risk assets. The weakening of the dollar has the opposite effect.  ""The BTC-DXY relationship will be hard to shake for long, though. It's not just that the U.S. dollar is the denominator in the most-quoted pair for the crypto asset (and when the denominator goes down in value, the ratio goes up, all else being equal) – it's also that a weaker dollar boosts global liquidity by giving U.S. dollar debt holders around the world more room to breathe,"" Acheson said in Monday's edition of the newsletter.  The chart shows debt issued by firms in a currency other than that of their home country from early 2000 to 2022. The U.S. dollar is clearly the preferred choice, with the percentage of debt denominated in the greenback holding steady around 70% since 2010.  Lastly, while popular opinion attributes gold's impressive bull run of the 2000s to the launch of the spot-based exchange-traded funds (ETF), the positive macro environment, including periods of sustained DXY weakness, also played a big role.  So, trends in the DXY are too important to be ignored for long by crypto market players and bitcoin could pick up a bid if the greenback continues to lose altitude.  DXY sell-off has legs  The dollar's recent decline has legs, according to Goldman Sachs (GS).  ""The Dollar sold off sharply in response to cooler inflation and anticipation of a more patient Fed stance beyond July. We think this can extend in the near term because the same factors that weighed on this report look likely to be softer still in coming months, and the policy implications bring welcome relief to a number of corners of the market,"" Goldman's Economics Research team said in a note to clients on Friday.  Acheson voiced a similar opinion, saying that fundamentals point to a continued decline in dollar.  ""The USD decline feels solid. It was a long time coming, and fundamentals point to its continued slide. Despite signs that the consumer in the U.S. is still strong (more on this below), inflation is heading lower, fast. Headline inflation in the U.S. on a year-on-year basis is now lower than that of Japan. Let that sink in. True, this only applies to headline inflation and not core, but still,"" Acheson noted.  Traders expect the Federal Reserve to halt its tightening cycle after the expected 25 basis point interest rate hike later this month, the Fed fund futures show. Since March 2022, the central bank has raised rates by 500 basis points to the 5% to 5.25% range. The tightening was partly responsible for last year's crypto market crash.

The meeting will concern ""digital-asset legislation and related issues including tax, national security, privacy and climate,"" the report said. Recently, lawmakers from the House and Senate have introduced separate bills in an attempt to bring clarity to crypto regulation, though the reality of a divided Congress means it's unclear whether such efforts will bear fruit.  On June 6, the SEC charged Coinbase with breaching federal securities law. Coinbase responded saying the SEC's action violates due process and constitutes an abuse of discretion. Coinbase shares rose over 24% Thursday after a court handed Ripple and by implication, the crypto industry, a partial victory in a case against the SEC, ruling that Ripple's XRP token is not a security.

15021432,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543045,1689667252,BTC Price Analysis: Why Is Bitcoin Down Today?,"The Bitcoin price has fallen to the lower end of its almost one-month trading range between $29,800 and $31,300. Already yesterday, BTC briefly fell to as low as $29,704, only to recover to $30,306 within a few hours. At press time, BTC was again moving towards the $30,000 mark, and another fall and liquidity grab seems likely. While this week the macro data releases are pretty quiet, it’s worth taking a look at what’s happening in the Bitcoin market itself. Why Is Bitcoin Down Today? Swissblock Insights observed a peculiar calm in the market when Bitcoin reached a new yearly high of $31.840 last week. However, the momentum quickly faded, and selling pressure increased, causing BTC to drop to the low $30ks. They highlight the narrow Bollinger Bands, stating, “The Bollinger Bands are very narrow, with only a 4.2% value difference separating the upper and lower bands. A move is brewing.” Moreover, the analysts emphasize the need for a significant catalyst to inject life into the current lackluster scenario: Volatility is expected to appear on the scene, although, in the short term, we are in no man’s land; liquidity remains low, open interest is still flat and shorts are nowhere to be seen. There’s no command in the direction we are going, and only a significant catalyst can spice things up in this dull scenario we are in. According to the analysts, a breakdown of the $29.650 support level would invalidate a long setup. On the other hand, a bullish leg up $31.500 could reignite momentum and surge the price to $33,000. But for this to happen, spot demand needs to reignite strongly and longs need to enter the market, “otherwise momentum will continue to fading.” Related Reading: This Bitcoin Continuation Pattern Points To 3-6 Months Of Uptrend Ahead Glassnode, an on-chain data provider, further illuminates the current state of the Bitcoin market. Despite the temporary yearly high, they describe the market as “extremely quiet”, also pointing to the Bollinger Bands. This compression in volatility signals a market reminiscent of the calm observed in early January, as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Furthermore, Glassnode’s analysis reveals a slow but steady inflow of capital into Bitcoin. The Realized Cap currently sits just shy at $396 billion. After hitting a cycle low at $380 billion, the metric indicates that a slow but steady stream of capital is entering the market throughout 2023. Glasnode also emphasizes that investors remain unwilling to part with their held supply, resulting in choppy market conditions similar to those seen in 2016 and 2019-20 periods. Total realized profit and loss resembles the historic trend: If we take a ratio between total realized profit and loss, we can also note that a lower high in this ratio was set this week. If sustained, it may allude to similar choppy market conditions seen in both 2019-20, and again in the second half of 2021. The analysis also highlights the profit-locking behavior among Bitcoin holders, with the majority of both short-term (88%) and long-term holders’ balances (73%) held in profit. However, short-term holders are the primary entities that are active in the market. Related Reading: Big Bitcoin Move Ahead: Bollinger Bands See Extreme Squeeze Out of the total 39.600 BTC in daily exchange inflows, 78% of this is associated with the STH cohort. This means that short term holders may have to trim their profits for the time being before selling pressure eases and the bulls can take the upper hand again. GreekLive, an options expert, explains that the Bitcoin market is still losing liquidity, which makes it highly susceptible to spikes and V-shaped recoveries: Cryptocurrencies encountered a V-shaped market today, with BTC falling below $29,700 and ETH below $1,875, before rebounding in a V-shaped during Asian trading hours to regain the round number of points, but the options market barely reacted to this. The analysis advises sellers to focus on static protection and have risk control plans for holding options until expiration. For buyers, timely profit-taking and using futures to hedge options are recommended risk management strategies. At press time, BTC traded at $30,064.

42410202,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUNAk,1689666419,"Reddit Community Tokens Rocket as Rule Change Speculation Boosts MOON, BRICK","Moons (MOON), the native token of Reddit's r/CryptoCurrency community of over 6.5 million users, has chalked up a triple-digit price gain this week. One analyst cited Reddit's recent change in terms of service as possible reason for the impressive price rally  MOON's price has surged 170% to almost 25 cents from 9 cents, according to data tracked by Coingecko. The cryptocurrency is listed on SushiSwap, Gate.io and MEXC.  Moons are ERC-20 tokens distributed as rewards to users for their posts or comments in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit. The coins can be freely traded, tipped, or spent in the community for different purposes. The tokens can also be stored in Reddit's Ethereum-based wallet, called Vault.  The Bricks (BRICK) token, distributed as a reward for contributions in the r/Fortnite subreddit, has surged 300% in two days.  Over the weekend, a trending post in the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit said Reddit's terms of service have changed, allowing the trading of verified virtual goods like avatars and Reddit's community points.  Per Coingecko's co-founder and COO, Bobby Ong, the speculation about impending changes to Reddit has driven the two tokens higher.  ""Reddit's Terms of Service recently changed where it now explicitly allows for trading Reddit's tokenized Community Points. The change also goes alongside the removal of Reddit's non-tokenized Coins and Awards. No firm changes have been announced for Reddit's Community Points yet, but the community is speculating that Reddit will give more attention to the Community Points. This has resulted in MOON and BRICK tokens increasing by over 100% in value this week,"" Ong told CoinDesk.  Note that community points have always been tradable, but it's troublesome to trade those through the Reddit app, per ONG. ""It's easy to send CPs to other Reddit users from the app, but to trade them, one has to export the private key from the Reddit wallet and import it into a crypto wallet. Then trade the CPs on an Arbitrum Nova DEX,"" ONG said in a tweet thread.  Users of the r/CryptoCurrency subreddit responded positively to the terms of change post, with cryptocurrency exchange Kraken thanking the subreddit for providing updates about the change in terms of service.  A member of Kraken added that the exchange is ""always open to adding new digital assets. The comment has raised hopes for an eventual listing of the Moons token on the Kraken exchange and may have contributed to the token's price surge.",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING | ARB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/18/reddit-community-tokens-rocket-as-rule-change-speculation-boosts-moon-brick,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/96acd9e52c1910da4b192341bf491ef548c479e9-1699x1175.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As per the exchange, the termination happened because the AFA failed to comply with partnership obligations. Partnership Background Binance and AFA went into business in AFA, with the former becoming the official naming sponsor of the country's national football team. The deal was for a five-year partnership, generating significant buzz in the crypto space. However, things started to sour after the AFA allegedly failed to fully comply with its partnership obligations leading to the dissolution. As per Binance, the AFA's non-compliance conflicted with their business values and partnership principles. Wu Blockchain tweeted: ""Binance has terminated its five-year partnership with the Argentine soccer association, just after a year, citing a breach of contract. The move comes at a time when Binance is cutting staff and employee benefits. In January 2022, Binance became the main sponsor of Argentina’s national soccer team."" More Troubles For Binance Binance is currently going through challenging times after news came out that they have reportedly laid off several staff members after a number of executives left the firm. Apparently, more than 1,000 staff members were let go over the past few weeks. It should be noted that Binance CEO CZ has tweeted that the numbers reported were grossly inaccurate. AFA's Crypto Partnership The Binance partnership was far from AFA’s first crypto rodeo. Previously, the AFA had partnered with global exchange ByBit as its main sponsor.

His influence on DOGE has been nothing short of remarkable, with any mention or action from him causing significant fluctuations in its price. In the digital currency landscape, where DOGE has struggled to keep pace with its counterparts despite the recent positive sentiment surrounding cryptocurrencies, any movement on the meme coin carries a heightened significance. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Encounters Familiar Resistance, Prompting Concerns About Bull Run Enthusiasts eagerly await every word uttered by Musk, recognizing the potential impact his statements can have on the price and overall market sentiment. Given this context, what did Elon Musk, the Tesla and SpaceX top honcho and Twitter owner, say this time, and how did it reverberate within the DOGE community? Elon Musk ‘Doges’ Preference Boosts Dogecoin Price Musk recently responded to a question on a popular social media platform. The question was about his preference between cats and dogs, and the enigmatic billionaire, promptly answered, “Doges.” This seemingly innocuous response had an immediate impact on the price of the meme coin. Doges — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 17, 2023 Following Musk’s endorsement, Dogecoin experienced a surge in its price on Monday, with a notable 3% gain. Its trading value climbed from $0.07 to $0.073, reflecting the enthusiastic market response to Musk’s statement. The sudden price increase further solidified the significance of Musk’s influence on Dogecoin and the broader cryptocurrency market. DOGE to USD gets a little boost. Source: CoinMarketCap However, as of the time of writing, the initial excitement has subsided, and DOGE’s price on Coingecko has adjusted to $0.070024. Despite the slight dip from the peak, the meme coin still managed to record a modest increase of 0.5% within the last 24 hours. Over seven days, Dogecoin showcased a more promising rally, with a substantial gain of 8.2%. Source: Coingecko Crypto Trading Expert Foresees DOGE Breakout Meanwhile, crypto trading expert Ali Martinez recently took to Twitter to share his prediction that Dogecoin is on the brink of a breakout, presenting an opportunity for investors. Leveraging an analysis of critical resistance levels and historical data on address accumulation, Martinez foresees a potential 10% price surge if DOGE surpasses the significant $0.75 supply wall. #Dogecoin is trying to break out!

42410200,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcUNHM,1689662579,Levered Bullish Longs Getting Liquidated as Bitcoin Market Softens,"On-chain data shows that traders' bullish long positions on bitcoin are being liquidated as the cryptocurrency struggles to gather traction above $30,000.  Data from CoinGlass shows that $85.68 million in long positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours, making up the majority of the $116.38 million in positions ‘rekt’ as the crypto market softens.  CoinGlass data also suggests that a significant number of liquidated traders had high-leveraged positions, with many that held positions between the $30,200 and $30,500 range.  Futures trading involves the use of leverage, meaning traders can take large long/short position by depositing a relatively small amount of money, called a margin, with the exchange providing the rest of the value. That exposes futures traders to liquidations – forced closure of long/short positions due to margin shortages often caused by the market moving against the direction of the levered bet.  The use of leverage has been creeping back into the market after hitting a low at the end of April. The higher the degree of leverage in the market, the greater the probability of wild price swings.  CryptoQuant’s estimated leverage ratio for bitcoin has risen from 0.19 at the end of April to 0.25 currently. It could rise further, as the recent bitcoin spot-ETF filings by BlackRock and other traditional finance heavyweights has revived bullish sentiment in the crypto market.  ""There's a continued focus solely on U.S. (ETFs),"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, told CoinDesk earlier.

Self-custody platform GK8 was sold to Galaxy Digital as part of Celsius’ bankruptcy proceedings, and while the exact details of the sale were not disclosed, Galaxy spokesman Michael Wursthorn earlier told CoinDesk that the price was significantly less than the $115 million Celsius bought it for.  The bankrupt crypto lender closed its Series B round in November 2021. Growth equity firm Westcap and one of Quebec’s pension funds led the round, which was oversubscribed, expanding the raise from $400 million to $750 million.  Initially, one group of Series B shareholders argued that the $24 million allocated does not cover the entirety of their legal expenses, and another said that the $1 million represents an unfair “windfall” for a certain group.  The largest group of Series B shareholders said in a filing that they plan to share $1 million of the settlement equally with all preferred shareholders, and are arguing that the court should disregard objections and approve this settlement to allow the rest of the bankruptcy process – which would include retail users – to move forward.  Celsius and its creditors are due back in court in New York on July 18 at 10 A.M. eastern time.

The price could rise further if it clears the $7.35 and $7.50 resistance levels. Chainlink token price is showing positive signs and rising from $6.50 against the US dollar. The price is trading above the $7.00 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is a major bullish trend line forming with support near $6.65 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could gain bullish momentum above the $7.35 resistance zone. Chainlink (LINK) Price Eyes More Gains After a short-term downside correction, LINK price found support near the $6.45 level against the US Dollar. A low was formed near $6.458 and the price started a fresh increase, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. There was a clear move above the $6.65 and $6.90 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $7.36 swing high to the $6.458 low. LINK price is now trading above the $7.00 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). There is also a major bullish trend line forming with support near $6.65 on the 4-hour chart of the LINK/USD pair. The pair is now facing resistance near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $7.36 swing high to the $6.458 low. Source: LINKUSD on TradingView.com The first major resistance is near the $7.35 zone. A clear break above $7.35 may possibly start a fresh increase toward the $7.50 and $7.85 levels. The next major resistance is near the $8.00 level, above which the price could revisit $8.80. Dips Supported?

15012411,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543011,1689645605,Ethereum Four Straight Days Down: Bullish Or Bearish?,"While most crypto market watchers remain focused on Bitcoin’s ongoing struggle with $31,000, Ethereum recently closed above the psychologically important $2000 level for the first time in weeks. Now poised to close lower for four straight days, let’s take an evidence-based approach and determine whether four consecutive days lower for Ether is historically bullish or bearish going forward. Let’s dive in! Ethereum’s Close Above $2000 Followed By Pullback After closing at an impressive multi-week high and back above the $2000 level on July 13th, Ether has pulled back for four consecutive sessions, one of the conditions we’ll test momentarily. To better add context to the test, we’ll also add two more conditions requiring that [1] Ether is above its 200ma and that [2] its 200ma is rising. Why? The 200ma and its slope both act as simple filters to help determine market regime. For example, this latest four day pullback in Ether occurs in an improving market in which ETH is above the rising 200ma. If the current four day pullback were occurring in a down trending market regime, we would require that ETH be below its declining 200ma. Ethereum daily chart | ETHUSD on TradingView.com What does this pullback in Ethereum suggest for its price? To find out, we’ll look at all signals since inception, and also compare those signals to a simple “buy and hold” approach. This will provide us with a baseline to better understand today’s test results. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks $2,000 As The Bulls Take Over Crypto Market Four Days Down Compared To Buy And Hold The holding time graphic below shows historical results for Ether’s current technical setup on top with a simple “buy and hold” approach on the bottom. In other words, we’ll show hypothetical results using various holding times solely for when Ethereum has closed lower for four straight days while above its rising 200ma on top. The bottom results will act as a baseline, assuming a hypothetical purchase of ETHUSD with no conditions whatsoever and an exit n-days later. Average Trade Comparison | SOURCE: REKTelligence, Tableau While both approaches show positive average trade results over every exit we tested from 7 days through 90 days, our baseline “buy and hold” actually outperforms the current technical setup of four days down. The single exception is the “exit in 90 days” in which the current setup slightly outpaces the historical average “buy and hold” trade, beating it 62.1% to 59.4%. But while the average trade statistic remains important, it does not always tell the whole story. When looking at a comparison of the largest hypothetical losses for both approaches using the same conditions described earlier, note that the largest losses (i.e., worst trades) for the current four days down setup are far lower than for a simple “buy and hold” approach. This largest loss comparison indicates that while the current setup may not beat “buy and hold” in terms of average trade, Ethereum may currently have a lower than usual risk exposure – something most experienced traders will appreciate. Largest Loss Comparison | SOURCE: REKTelligence, Tableau Related Reading: Tradecurve Unique Set Of Features Has Ethereum Holders Excited While the past doesn’t predict future, based on our analysis, Ethereum looks poised for potential upside mostly in line with typical “buy and hold” expectations. In other words, not overly exciting and apparently lacking any meaningful edge at the moment. That said, risk also appears lower than usual relative to the “buy and hold” largest loss stats. Traders take note. Ethereum may now be offering its typical return profile based on its current technical setup, but with a lower overall risk exposure.

However, the stablecoins have seen better days, as the stablecoin has seen its market cap drop drastically over the past few months. Related Reading: 29% Of Bitcoin’s Circulating Supply Is Now Presumed Lost Forever The second-largest stablecoin has seen its market cap drop by over $1.4 billion in just the last few days thanks to a surge in redemptions. $1.4 Billion Redeemed In One Week The stablecoin market was rocked this week by a massive redemption of USDC. According to Circle and data obtained from Coinmarketcap, the supply of USDC decreased by $1.4 billion in just seven days as Circle’s rate of token burning outnumbered the rate of new token creations. This led to a market cap drop from $27.4 billion to $26.9 billion in a 7-day timeframe. This comes as the overall supply of USDC has been on a steep decline since the beginning of the year, plummeting from $45 billion to its present level of $26 billion. The worst drop in USDC’s market cap this year came during the height of Silicon Valley Bank’s shutdown. USDC market cap plunges | Source: Glassnode According to Nansen, Circle burned $1.6 billion in USDC in a single day. During this period, Circle’s market cap fell by more than $10 billion. This came as investors rushed to redeem USDC due to Circle having cash reserves in the failed bank. What Does This Mean For USDC? The rush to redeem USDC over the course of the past year has prompted doubts about the reserves underpinning the stablecoin. But the stablecoin market appears to be doing just fine in terms of maintaining its peg to the US dollar. Circle also maintains that the USDC cryptocurrency is backed 1:1 by cash and other monetary equivalents. USDC market cap sitting at $27.25 billion | Source: Market Cap USDC on Tradingview.com In March of this year, Circle switched to short-term maturity bonds. This means that the USDC reserve is now held 80% in short-dated US treasuries and 20% in cash deposits within the US banking system. Given this, there are worries among investors as redemptions at this scale could strain the reserves if they’re invested in less liquid assets. This would explain the high volume of redemptions over this time. Related Reading: XRP Crosses 1 Million Trades Per Minute Following Court Ruling The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, but stablecoins have become one of the backbones of the industry due to their ability to offer more stability. Overall, most of the stablecoin market remains split between USDT and USDC, making up more than 83% of the total stablecoin market cap. For now, USDT has the higher momentum.

But the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization regained some lost ground to recently trade at $30,130, roughly flat over the past 24 hours, and within the range it's occupied for much of the past month. Bitcoin soared past $31,700 last Thursday after the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York ruled that Ripple's sale of its XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts.  Analysts have suggested that bitcoin may continue to experience dips below this threshold until the SEC decides whether to approve one of the multiple spot bitcoin ETF applications that financial services giants, including BlackRock, filed last month. Those filings spurred a sharp, mid-June increase in BTC and other cryptos longing for a price catalyst.  But the SEC, which has rejected a number of spot BTC applications over the past two years, is unlikely to move for months, given the unhurried pace of its previous decisions. The agency is still gathering information about the proposals.  ""There's a continued focus solely on U.S. (ETFs),"" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, said in a phone interview with CoinDesk. ""People are not going to be as optimistic until we get a further update that we're going to get that ETF done in the States.""  He added: ""We may see a lot of back and forth before we get that firm sign-off (from the SEC).""  Ether, the second largest crypto by market value, was recently changing hands at $1,913, off nearly a half-percentage point from Sunday, same time and well off its heights last week above $2,000. Other major cryptos, which also soared last week, sagged on Monday before rebounding slightly. XRP and ADA, the token of the Cardano smart contracts platform, were recently off 1.5% and 0.6%, respectively, while SOL, the native crypto of the Solana blockchain was down more than 2.8%.  Equity markets buoyed by last week's encouraging second quarter earnings from a number of major banks edged up with the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 rising 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs announce their Q2 results on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.  In an email early Monday, Moya noted ""some progress in small crypto companies finding banks that can help facilitate transactions, as Customers Bancorp has emerged as the winner from the downfall of Signature Bank and Silvergate Capital Corp.""  ""Bitcoin’s range of $29,500 and $31,500 may hold until we get a major crypto headline,"" he added.

Based in Dubai, Jakubcek’s responsibilities are global, including the Asia Pacific region, where retail cryptocurrency adoption but also bad actors and scams have soared.  ""Cryptocurrencies, as practical technology, are basically bound to be abused by criminals because it is convenient and because it is practical,"" he said.  Jakubcek spends a lot of his time training law enforcement throughout the region on gathering evidence and tracking down who’s behind these schemes – and often they are the same crooks as in traditional finance: scam centers in southeast Asia.  “We all know that there is no such thing as high guaranteed profits. But to many people who are more financially naive, this may sound like a reasonable proposition,” he explains. “This is why it is really important to promote crypto literacy and raise awareness of the potential risk connected with cryptocurrencies.”  Years of investigations  Law enforcement has been investigating crypto crimes for years and has found a lot of operational success, thanks to blockchain's transparent nature.  Despite its user-friendliness for everyone, including criminals, it is also beneficial for investigators as the activity is out there on-chain and not hidden in bank logs and shell corporations.  Often, it’s more effective to track back wallets to exchanges and request KYC data than to rely on tracing IP addresses to telcos because of the prevalence of VPNs and other ways of masking connections.  While Jakubcek spends a lot of his time working with real law enforcement from around the world, sometimes, his group encounters fraudulent requests – not necessarily always bad actors, but rather conning private investigators attempting to masquerade as cops in order to get more info for their clients.  One private investigator, Jakubcek recalls, dissatisfied with an initial refusal from Binance to disclose customer data to a private individual, sent over a second request but from a fake domain name.  “It was not the usual law enforcement domain, so we checked the domain, and we discovered it was registered one day prior to the request,” Jakubcek said. “It was kind of obvious that the private investigator wanted to pretend to be something that he was not.”  Fake court orders and political problems  Fake court orders asking for funds to be moved are another thing his team has dealt with.  “We are very lucky to have a team of almost 30 ex-law enforcement people, because we know how law enforcement requests should look like,"" he said.  A global company like Binance has a tough time avoiding geo-politics, which is a simple byproduct of operating in so many of the world’s markets.  Law enforcement requests can sometimes conflict with different countries’ national interests. In 2020 and 2021, for instance, the United States announced a series of sanctions against key individuals in Hong Kong’s political leadership and law enforcement for their role in undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and implementing a controversial national security law.  There isn’t yet a cut-and-dry answer on how Binance balances a legitimate law enforcement request under local rules with competing global interests.  ""There are jurisdictions with which we have to be sensitive; we also have to consider the nature of the crime, and who is the target of inquiry. For some of the requests, if the individuals are of sensitive nationality, then we are not responding,” he said.  So far, from Hong Kong, Jakubcek says that 90% of the requests are “purely fraud related.”  “Personally, I don’t remember any politically sensitive requests coming from Hong Kong,” he said. “I’m not saying there hasn’t been any, but in my investigations career in APAC, I don’t remember it happening.”  Important events.
