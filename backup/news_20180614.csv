The association is testing Masterchain to facilitate communications within the national banking system, according to the Masterchain white paper. This would mark the latest move to use the platform to replace the SWIFT inter-bank communication network, a use case which was first discussed in April 2018.  The platform was created by the nation's FinTech Association in collaboration with Russia's 14 largest banks, including VTB.  According to the white paper, the system will include Russian banks and government agencies responsible for contract registration and market regulation. FinTech is claiming that switching to Masterchain in processing mortgage contracts will reduce operating costs up to five times and instead of days the transactions will take minutes.  The project also is expected to produce a KYC mechanism based on a digital identity so that banks will be able to share credit histories and information about fraud cases without breaking bank secrecy. The system is also going to deal with bank guarantees and letters of credits  However, as previously reported by CoinDesk, the ultimate goal for Masterchain is still to replace SWIFT. In particular, concerns that U.S. or European Union sanctions against Russia in 2014 might eventually remove the nation from the SWIFT system have spurred Russia's experimentation with alternate financial communication systems. Previous tests have shown issues with processing different document format.

As such, the news effectively ensures that the software for which a company called Block.one raised more than $4 billion during an almost year-long initial coin offering (ICO) will now be accessible. According to best estimates, the blockchain began operations at 17:46 UTC.  This happened after a roughly a week of deliberation and testing by block producer candidates – those groups vying for one of 21 validator node spots in which they will receive rewards for verifying transactions – from all around the world. While that testing phase uncovered several vulnerabilities that caused two groups to go head-to-head on the correct implementation and delays for the launch, on June 9, block producer candidates voted unanimously in favor of launching the blockchain.  As per the project's process, that percentage was the two-thirds +1 of the candidate community to initiate the launch, but also per the plan, the blockchain wasn't officially live until further validation had been completed, an appointed block producer launched the chain and then 15 percent of EOS holdings had voted.  And once 15 percent of token holders had voted to establish the set of 21 elected block producers, the chain became active. This took longer than many had anticipated for many reasons, including security concerns with the voting process.  Following the launch, tokens were trading at $10.45.

Speaking at the Yahoo! All Markets Summit: Crypto event in San Francisco Thursday, the official told the audience that the agency ""doesn't see a lot of value in treating ether today as a security,"" explaining that the fact that there is no central figure or group responsible for ethereum, and therefore ""the assets may not represent an investment contract.""  The statements are the latest in a long line of remarks that have found various regulatory officials opining on whether the nature of the sale in which ether was issued made it subject to U.S. securities laws. Such a view has been advanced largely by former regulators, while the SEC has largely spoken generally (and sometimes derogatorily) about ICOs and token sales.  In pre-written remarks today, Hinman said:  ""Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions.""  That being said, Hinman cautioned that ""the analysis of whether something is a security is not static and does not strictly inherent to the instrument.""  He also pushed back on the idea that there can be utility tokens which are not securities, saying ""even digital assets with utility that function solely as a means of exchange in a decentralized network could be packaged and sold as an investment strategy that can be a security.""  Other cryptocurrencies, by Hinman's explanation, can still be classified as securities. While a token in and of itself may not be a security, the purchaser's expectation during a sale will determine its classification, he said. If a purchaser has a reasonable expectation of profit based on the seller's actions, the token is likely a security.  Hinman reiterated that the SEC is willing to work with token projects and their legal counsel to establish whether a project should register with the regulator, echoing numerous other SEC officials.

The company - which is based in Canada - will be using an existing factory in the town of Murphysboro to host a solar panel array.  Captain Kirk told the Tribune:  ""The concept is so, I guess the word is bizarre. You have to blank your mind and say, 'What is blockchain, again? How does mining operate, again?' The concepts are really strange, and yet when you begin to grasp it, it makes sense.""  That being said, while Solar Alliance is building the infrastructure to support a mining facility, it does not actually intend to mine bitcoins. Instead, the firm intends to lease the building to mining firms after the solar panels are completed. While there is no timeline yet on when Solar Alliance will finish renovating the facility and installing the panels, chief executive Jason Bak told the Tribune that he plans to start finding potential tenants by the end of 2018.  Bak also intends to dedicate some of the space inside the building to an educational venture, aimed at explaining how to install solar panels to those interested.

Having offered no proof to back his claim, Chen's accusation of a 30,000 BTC debt – an amount worth nearly $200 million at press time – immediately stirred up heated discussion in the Chinese crypto community.  As the allegation emerged, Li originally said he did not care to comment on the accusation and it was Chen's responsibility to present evidence to back up his claim.  Yet, on Wednesday, Chen took another shot at Li, publishing 11 further allegations against Li, which also accused him of luring retail investors during the bull market in order to liquidate his profits.  Following that, on Thursday, Li published an article in which he denied all of Chen's accusations, providing individual responses to each.  In explaining the 30,000 BTC debt claim, Li wrote:  ""Once again, it's not true. The fund was a private equity 'equivalent to 20 million yuan ($3 million).' And I never promised to guarantee the fund's value using bitcoin. My quote was 'We hope (this fund) can outrun the bitcoin market.' As for the 'due in September' part, the fund was set up in a '4+1' model, so it ought to due in September this year. Chen is just muddying the water.""  Li went further, saying that Chen has no evidence to back up the claims, which are ""blunt defamation.""  In a response to CoinDesk, Li said he is ""definitely"" mulling the option of taking proper legal measures against Chen.  Chen has not yet publically responded to Li's article and could not be reached by CoinDesk for comment.  This isn't the first time Chen has sparked controversy in the cryptocurrency community with contentious remarks.  Earlier this year, Zhu Xiaohu, a notable Chinese investor and managing director at GSR Ventures Management, openly said he does not want to be involved in any blockchain-themed WeChat group discussions, because he wanted to ""maintain his integrity.""  Responding to that, Chen said:  ""Zhu just wants to die in the old world but I want to live in the new world to come. ... He doesn't event care to keep learning. He's also killing the innovation of a group of passionate young people while pretending to maintain that integrity of his.""

42429212,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQvh,1528974037,Bitcoin Prices Stabilize Above $6K – But Will They Stay?,"Bitcoin (BTC) has made a 6 percent recovery from the 90-day low hit on Wednesday, neutralizing the immediate bearish outlook.  The leading cryptocurrency fell to $6,108 at around 16:30 UTC yesterday on Bitfinex – its lowest level since February 6 – bolstering the already oversold conditions shown by the daily relative strength index (RSI) yesterday.  Hence, the subsequent recovery to $6,500 levels currently is hardly surprising and indicates that bitcoin may have found a temporary bottom around $6,100. However, long-run technical setup remains bearish and the battered bulls will want to see stronger evidence of bear exhaustion before hitting the market with fresh bids.  Consequently, the market could remain directionless over the next 48 hours and bargain hunters may chip in later if the cryptocurrency looks stable around $6,500.  4-hour chart  While prices fell to $6,108 yesterday, the RSI created a higher low, signaling a bullish divergence.  So, the stage is set for a corrective rally, although the upside is seen gathering steam only if bitcoin manages to hold above $6,425 (April 1 low) for next 24 hours. In this case, a move toward $7,000 becomes more of a possibility, or even as high as the falling channel resistance, currently located at $7,380.  That will be easier said than done, though, as the moving averages (MAs) are still biased bearish – the 50-candle, 100-candle and 200-candle MAs are all trending south, indicating a bearish setup.  Daily chart  The daily moving averages (5-day and 10-day) seen here are also pointing south, and the broader outlook remains bearish as long as bitcoin is trapped inside the falling channel.  Currently, BTC is having a tough time crossing the 5-day MA, currently located at $6,857.  Bargain hunters will likely enter the market after the short-term moving averages have bottomed out.  While charts show early signs of bear exhaustion, the long-term outlook is still poor for the bulls, as indicated by the pennant breakdown and the bearish crossover between 5-month and 10-month MAs.  View  BTC seems to have made a temporary low at $6,109 and may trade sideways in the next 48 hours or so.  The probability of a corrective rally to $7,000 and above would rise if the price holds above $6,425 (April 1 low) for the next 24 hours.  Bearish scenario: Repeated failure to hold above $6,425 despite the bullish price RSI divergence (seen in 4-hour chart) could yield a drop to $6.000. A daily close (as per UTC) below that level would open up downside towards the $5,000 mark.

42429209,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQnh,1528970429,Thailand's SEC Expects to Approve 5 ICOs This Month,"Thailand's securities regulator is reportedly expecting to approve five initial coin offerings (ICOs) later this month.  According to the Bangkok Post on Wednesday, the Thailand Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that, while 50 ICOs in the country are currently applying for regulatory approval, five of them are already in a position to move ahead.  However, the token sales will have to wait until later in June, when a royal decree on cryptocurrency, finalized last month, formally comes into law.  While it remains unclear why these ICO projects are likely to win approval, Thawatchai Kiatkwankul, director of the SEC's corporate finance division, said projects need to have commercial value and go through vetting before they can be considered for registration.  If the registrations do go ahead, it will mark Thailand as one of the first nations to allow ICOs to proceed legally in a regulated environment. Other jurisdictions including Bermuda and Russia are also moving to introduce frameworks that would allow approved ICO projects.  According to the report, the royal decree was first announced on May 15, following a months-long process that saw public hearings and legislative debates around the issue.  Besides ordering ICO projects to register with the financial watchdog and to receive approvals before starting a token sale, the law also puts a 300,000 baht (around $9,000) hard cap on contributions by individual retail investors for each project.  In addition, other industry players such as exchanges, brokers and dealers that are involved in cryptocurrency transactions are also required to register with the SEC within 90 days of the law's introduction, the report said.

42429205,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQhh,1528966831,Jim Chanos Is Out of His Depth Trashing Crypto Assets,"Formerly a developer and director of software engineering, Andrew Rodwin is a crypto assets and blockchain trainer in the Boston area.      Add Jim Chanos to the list of venerable experts who consider cryptocurrencies to be a scam.  Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Robert Shiller and many others have made their opinion clear. According to 99bitcoins.com, bitcoin has been declared dead 300 times.  In a recent interview, Chanos says, among other things, ""Cryptocurrency is a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough.""  Jim Chanos is an expert on financial fraud. He even teaches a course on it at Yale. But he is not an expert on cryptos. Neither is Buffett. Their cluelessness about the topic shows. In positing an argument, they subscribe to Huey Long's rhetoric dictum ""weak point: holler louder.""  At a high level, the flaw in their positions is: ""I know finance, crypto is finance, so I know crypto."" Finance is one of many aspects of crypto. Treating crypto as ""just another financial instrument"" is naive. It's not an equity. It's not a commodity. While Chanos is not the only one guilty of misusing the term ""cryptocurrency,"" it's still seriously misleading.  Not every crypto is a currency. Ethereum arguably isn't. Cardano isn't. Hundreds more aren't. If he took the time to learn more about crypto before issuing sweeping statements, Chanos would use the generic term ""crypto asset.""  Throughout the interview, Chanos makes a series of vague, misleading, unsupported contentions.  Chanos opens with a high-level description of financial fraud patterns. As he is an expert on that, and I'm not, I assume that what he writes on this topic is airtight. Once he veers into crypto, I no longer give him the benefit of the doubt.  After covering fraud patterns, Chanos makes the following logical jump:  ""So today we've got bitcoin and ICOs [initial coin offerings], which went ballistic in 2017. I suspect going forward we're going to see more and more evidence of questionable companies as this bull market keeps advancing and aging. We're now nine years into this bull market, same as the '90s, so I suspect that now things are starting to percolate. I think bitcoin and the ICOs are just one manifestation of that.""  Chanos is saying that 1) bitcoin and 2) ICOs fit the pattern of questionable investments typified by the tail end of a bull market. He doesn't provide any detail of why they fit the pattern. They just do.  By the same logic, the world was flat because people declared it was flat. And by this argument, any new venture in the tail end of a bull market can be lumped into this category, shy of any analysis of why or why not it might fit the pattern. It's a round hole, so it must be a round peg. In reality, it's a square peg, but no matter. Hammer it into place!  Apples and oranges  Additionally, lumping in bitcoin with ICOs is sloppy at best. Bitcoin has been around since 2008. ICOs were not. And 2008 was ... not a bull market, to say the least. The phrase ""bitcoin and the ICOs"" is an apple-and-orange fruit salad of meaninglessness.  And ""the ICOs"" is a hugely diverse set of projects. Chanos is correct that some, perhaps most, are questionable, as a recent Wall Street Journal article demonstrated. That doesn't mean they all are.  When the internet took off, ""the dotcoms"" included Pets.com and Amazon.com. Lots of losers and some really big winners. If you wrote off the entire class, you failed to understand what was happening. Distinctions matter. Precision matters.  Separating wheat and chaff is a natural development in a paradigm shift. As Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar observed in their book ""Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond"":  ""[C]ryptoassets are not going through bizarre growing pains unique to them. Instead, they are experiencing the same evolutionary process that new asset classes over hundreds of years have had to go through as they matured.""  In writing about the interplay between financial and capital markets, Venezuelan economist Carlota Perez posited a similar dynamic.  Chanos then says, ""At one blockchain gathering there were a set of rented Lamborghinis parked outside to entice the traders and day traders and retail investors: this, too, can be yours if you hop aboard the blockchain and bitcoin bonanza!""  Ah, the Lambo argument! (Thank you, Consensus 2018.) Yes. The rented Lambos were an epic fail. When a handful of spoiled traders choose to embarrass themselves flaunting symbols of conspicuous consumption, they're easily lampooned. But it's not relevant to whether cryptos are innovative or fraudulent, any more than Nikola Tesla dying a pauper reflects on the value of his inventions.  The idiots with the Lambos are not bitcoin. They're just idiots with Lambos.  After a brief exposition on the relationship between government and fiat currency (which struck me as right on target), Chanos adds: ""In the new bitcoin and crypto-craze, the whole idea is that we need to get away from fiat currencies by creating our own fiat currency for which there is no lender of last resort, no third party adjudicator.""  Well yes. And no. The whole idea with bitcoin (but not all cryptos) is to create a currency which governments and banks cannot screw up. As in Weimar Germany. As in 2018 Venezuela.  As far as third-party adjudication goes, that can be used for good or ill. China, for instance, uses financial control to punish dissidents. And look at Venezuela. And Argentina. Chanos only cites the good, not the ill. That really weakens his point.  Apocalypse now?  But here is where Chanos really goes off the rails:  ""For those who believe it's a store of value in the coming apocalypse, the idea is that you're going to have to safeguard your key under a mountain with fingerprint and eye scan security while the hordes are outside your bunker trying to get in to use it – for what, I have no idea. Because for those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least. Food would work the best! ... And if you say, well, fiat currency is going to bring the world down, which could, of course, happen, then I say the last thing I'd want to own is bitcoin if the grid goes down.""  I've spent about 2,000 hours reading up on cryptos and never once saw that apocalyptic use case. Chanos apparently has crypto asset enthusiasts conflated with survivalists.  He also singles out one of the three aspects of money for which cryptocurrencies (a subset of crypto assets) are used: a store of value. They are also a means of exchange. For rhetorical purposes, the end-times store-of-value rant is catchier, but it's not grounded in reality. Gold is widely accepted as a store of value that is outside government control, but its use is not de-legitimized if a tiny fringe hoards it in anticipation of Armageddon.  The other distinction Chanos conveniently ignores is that while an apocalypse may be a binary event, economic misery produced by failed governments is not. Witness, Venezuela. The people of Venezuela are not sitting in bunkers hoarding private keys, but they are using crypto assets to work around real, in-your-face, economic woes brought on by an inept government that badly mismanaged its economy and its fiat currency. Cryptos make their lives better, because the government cannot screw them up, other than by making a bogus national crypto that no one wants.  In this environment, yes, cryptos are valuable as both a store of value and a means of exchange. Even Jamie Dimon, not exactly a crypto fanboy, saw the value of bitcoin in a disaster like Venezuela. Just because we in the United States have not experienced this sort of catastrophe doesn't make it less real.  Next, Chanos makes the common error of confusing pseudonymous with anonymous: ""Bitcoin is still the area for people who are trying to avoid taxation or other examinations of their transactions. That's one thing where I think it probably still has utility, but the governments have figured that out.""  Yes, the governments have figured it out, using tools like Chainalysis, and no, it is not the ideal area for people who are trying to avoid taxation. There are anonymous, not pseudonymous, cryptos for that, and the privacy they provide is not merely to avoid taxation: there are a host of reasons why people would want to keep their transactions private.  Cynics assume the only possible motivations for wanting transactional privacy are to avoid taxes, buy drugs, or launder money. Those are reasons. They're not the only reasons. Anyone who knows anything about bitcoin is not going to use it (in the U.S. anyway) to dodge taxes.  Next, Chanos regales us with a story about the hassle an investor went through when trying to cash out his bitcoin. This is yet another blunder by Chanos, of the crypto-ecosystem-is-not-crypto variety. The aforementioned hassle, no doubt, had to do with exchanges trying to comply with government know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering laws.  Using that story to indict bitcoin is a huge reach, and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the boundaries of cryptos relative to their surrounding ecosystems. If your Facebook iOS app repeatedly crashes, you don't replace your iPhone.  Right on the heels of that story, as if it justifies his conclusion, Chanos closes his crypto rant with ""So this is simply a security speculation game masquerading as a technological breakthrough in monetary policy.""  There is no detail or analysis in the interview that justifies the conclusion Chanos reaches. And crypto assets are not a technological breakthrough in monetary policy. They are a technological breakthrough in building secure and private markets, relying on mathematics rather than counterparty trust, with transparent, immutable records not subject to a single point of failure.  But to Chanos, an expert on financial fraud, because some investors treat bitcoin like a speculative asset, and we are late in a bull market, and some morons choose to flaunt their Lambos, then bitcoin must be a fraud. That is not rigorous logic.  Willful ignorance  And this is the problem with the rants by these experts.  Buffett, Chanos, Shiller ... all brilliant people, experts in their domain. But crypto is not their domain. They haven't taken the time to understand it, but they weigh in as if they do.  Warren Buffett called bitcoin ""rat poison squared."" Though late to the party, Berkshire Hathaway is now a big Apple investor. If someone stood up at a Berkshire Hathaway meeting and complained that Apple stock was rat poison squared, how seriously would Buffett take that position?  No one knows how all of this will turn out, of course. It's entirely possible that Chanos and Buffett, et. al. are right about cryptos. They may turn out to be an utter failure.  But if so, Chanos got lucky. He could have reached the same conclusion by flipping a coin.  Chanos was lazy. He did no rigorous logical analysis, which requires an understanding of what you are analyzing, because while he understands fraud, he knows almost nothing about cryptos.

According to a local news source Sina Finance on Thursday, Suning Bank developed the blockchain system in order to move its blacklist of suspect borrowers to a distributed database in an effort to allow collaboration with other banks on preventing credit fraud.  Using the system, each participating institution becomes a node of the blockchain that can access the original blacklist shared by Suning Bank. Node institutions can further update the list with their own data, the report indicates.  Founded by Suning in 2017, Suning Bank is one of the first online-to-offline commercial banks in China, launched by established private companies to provide loans to small and medium businesses.  The move to share data on users' trustworthiness is the latest by the financial institution to utilize blockchain technology in managing its credit systems.  In September of last year, Suning Bank joined another blockchain consortium created by two other private commercial banks – CITIC and Minsheng – which uses a blockchain system to record transactions of domestic letters of credit.  In March, CITIC touted in its annual financial filing that the platform has already facilitated transactions worth a total of $156 million.

42429202,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyLsQfh,1528948238,There's a New Bitcoin Core in Town – And It's Out to Troll Bitcoin Cash,"Has a cryptocurrency by trolls, for trolls, finally been created?  If not, the cryptocurrency bitcoin core (BTCC) certainly comes close. And no, we're not using the derogatory other name for the cryptocurrency most often referred to as bitcoin – the one that legendary crypto investor and bitcoin cash booster Roger Ver likes to berate.  Rather, BTCC is a new cryptocurrency, which ironically enough came about from a fork of bitcoin cash. Well, a hard fork of a bitcoin cash hard fork that is.  It's all a bit confusing, but after bitcoin cash's November 2017 hard fork, which was executed to fix the cryptocurrency's mining algorithm, a small group resisted, splitting the blockchain and creating a new project called ""bitcoin clashic."" But because bitcoin clashic didn't address the issue, it faded away after a few months.  Yet, another small group of ever-persistent developers forked bitcoin clashic – fixing its issues but leaving the updates from bitcoin cash's most recent hard fork – a couple weeks ago to create bitcoin core (BTCC).  Or in the words of the BTCC Twitter account:  ""We are the cool cousin that's a good wingman. Unlike the other one hating and trying to steal ur [sic] girl.""  That comment, while irreverent, speaks not only to the fact that BTCC is supposed to complement bitcoin (instead of compete with it as bitcoin cash is generally positioned as), but also that the BTCC devs are, in part, trolling Mr. Ver.  See, Ver has made it his mission to paint bitcoin cash as the ""real"" bitcoin – a protocol he contends better represents what Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of bitcoin, would have wanted. And while it's not the original chain, Ver very often renames bitcoin, ""bitcoin core"" (after the name of the team behind bitcoin's main software implementation), even going so far as to label bitcoin cash, ""bitcoin"" and bitcoin, ""bitcoin core"" on his website bitcoin.com.  While no one has a trademark over the bitcoin name, many are outraged by Ver's antics, contending that his categorizations will confuse new investors. And the developers behind BTCC seem to be aligned with those opposed to Ver.  The original BTCC website (which has since been altered) trolled Ver by arguing that BTCC is, in fact, the currency Ver was really talking about when he speaks about the ""real"" bitcoin. Even the cryptocurrency's main block explorer is called ""truevisionofsatoshi.com,"" referencing a tagline that many bitcoin cash supporters have taken to.  Plus, the team behind BTCC has also taken to poking fun at other notable bitcoin cash supporters, including John McAfee, the brash entrepreneur that made his money off anti-virus software and now shills crypto tokens on Twitter for a price.  But since trolling is a much-appreciated method for showing disdain in cryptocurrency circles, BTCC is getting plenty of attention.  Pseudonymous bitcoin subreddit moderator BashCo said that the cryptocurrency has a serious element, too, since it takes attention away from what many claim are fraudulent acts of rebranding by Ver. In this way, it might be helpful to think of BTCC as a monetized piece of performance art, one only made possible by cryptocurrencies.  Bashco told CoinDesk:  ""BTCC is interesting to me because it disrupts malicious attempts to rebrand bitcoin in order to promote an imposter coin.""  Branding debate  Backing up, bitcoin cash's launch sparked an ongoing debate over bitcoin's ""branding.""  This war started when those opposed to bitcoin cash started calling it ""bcash."" While those using bcash explained that the nickname was in an effort to eliminate confusion between bitcoin cash and bitcoin, the supporters of bitcoin cash didn't like the new moniker.  According to bitcoin cash supporters like Eli Afram, the Bitcoin Cash Australia founder, giving bitcoin cash that nickname was more than just a helpful signal.  ""When bitcoin cash first forked, many in the Bitcoin Core camp were so threatened they couldn't even call it by its name or even its ticker for short and referred to it as 'bcash,'"" Afram argued to CoinDesk.  Since then, this naming war has gone through many iterations.  As mentioned, bitcoin cash supporters see the cryptocurrency as the ""real"" bitcoin since it upped the block size, allowing for more transactions to happen on the network with lower fees – what they see as Satoshi's real interest in creating a cryptocurrency in the first place. Yet, detractors say it's not that easy – since bitcoin has amassed a huge network worth billions of dollars, technical work has to be slow and steady so as not to disrupt the technology from its use as a store of value.  Still, bitcoin cash proponents have begun calling bitcoin ""bitcoin core.""  As such, those in favor of bitcoin cash aren't seeing the new bitcoin core (BTCC) cryptocurrency as a humorous meme.  ""Bitcoin core (BTCC) was created to make people think bitcoin core (BTC) is bitcoin,"" said Ryan X. Charles, the co-founder and CEO of Yours, which notably moved from bitcoin to bitcoin cash after the hard fork.  Ver told CoinDesk that BTCC isn't ""even worth commenting on.""  And all this prompted Afram to say:  ""There's going to be an eternal naming war.""  A chain kept alive  But even with most people thinking BTCC is just a silly effort to fight back against bitcoin cash semantics, the developers behind the cryptocurrency, at least in their own words, trying to distance themselves from the naming war.  ""The original [bitcoin cash] was kept alive as an experimental testbed, and in case there was ever a use for it to make a positive contribution to bitcoin. It was, and is, a labor of love,"" an anonymous spokesperson for BTCC told CoinDesk.  Although, according to the spokesperson, the BTCC team doesn't exactly mind being seen as a bit of a joke, but he or she went on to claim the developers are taking the cryptocurrency more seriously.  ""Some members of the community decided to have some fun and leverage the publicity,"" the spokesperson said. ""However, the Bitcoin Core developers are committed to delivering a unique value proposition, adhering to core values and offering increased speed and enhanced privacy.""  The spokesperson even said the BTCC developers have a hard fork planned soon that will upgrade the protocol; the developers want to add confidential transactions, a privacy feature that hides user balances since they believe bitcoin doesn't go far enough to protect people's privacy.  Still, these comments are hard to take seriously since the cryptocurrency's official Twitter account and Telegram channel is full of trolling comments.  Even well-known cryptocurrency thought leaders such as Casa engineer Jameson Lopp are tweeting about it in a joking manner, while bitcoin investor Alistair Milne quipped in response:  ""Trolling level 10001.""
