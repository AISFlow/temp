The report provides valuable insights into Cardano’s achievements in Q2 2023, solidifying its position as a prominent player within the industry. With a strong focus on fostering a robust ecosystem and pushing the boundaries of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Cardano is poised to reshape the landscape of blockchain technology, according to Messari. Cardano TVL Ranking Skyrockets, Climbs From 34th to 21st Per the report, Cardano experienced substantial growth in stablecoin value, with a 34.9% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase and a significant 382.1% year-to-date (YTD) surge. Indigo Protocol emerged as a frontrunner in stablecoin and synthetic asset issuance, solidifying its dominance in the space. Furthermore, the Total Value Locked (TVL) witnessed a shift towards newer projects, as protocols created in the past six months accounted for 47.4% of TVL dominance in Q2. Related Reading: Curve Finance Resurgence: 70% Of Stolen Funds Recovered, Redemption On The Horizon The TVL in USD rose by 9.7% QoQ and 198.6% YTD. Cardano’s TVL ranking climbed from 34th to 21st across all chains in 2023. On the other hand, average daily decentralized application (dapp) transactions on Cardano surged by 49% QoQ, marking the third consecutive quarterly increase. Moreover, Minswap, an automated market maker (AMM), showcased the largest absolute growth in transaction volume. However, several new dapps also contributed to the overall surge. Minswap’s popularity soared in Q2, surpassing the leading NFT marketplace jpg.store regarding dapp transactions. This trend aligned with the sectoral shift, as DeFi activity gained momentum while NFT activity experienced a decline. The overall increase in dapp transactions reached a substantial 49.0% QoQ, averaging 57,900 daily transactions. Q2 NFT Metrics Reflect Market Correction According to Messari, NFT metrics experienced a decline in Q2. Average daily NFT transactions dropped by 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, while the total quarterly trading volume fell by 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million. This downward trend aligned with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices declined in 2023. Notably, NFT sales volume remained concentrated primarily in jpg.store, which dominated the marketplace with a 98% market share. Nevertheless, unique buyers continued to drive NFT activity, while a relatively small number of sellers catered to this larger pool of buyers. Messari further highlights that Cardano’s ecosystem showcased expansion in multiple sectors, particularly in DeFi. Protocols for swaps, stablecoins, synthetics, and unique Cardano-centric services like lending staking power surfaced alongside the incumbents. Related Reading: Shiba Inu (SHIB) Rides On Bullish Waves As Shibarium Launch Nears, Buy Now? Cardano’s second quarter showed substantial growth and diversification across various sectors, including DeFi, NFTs, and Layer-2 solutions. Key statistics revealed a surge in stablecoin value, a shift in TVL dominance towards newer projects, and an impressive increase in average daily dapp transactions. While NFT metrics experienced a decline, the ecosystem demonstrated resilience and competition among protocols. In contrast, Cardano’s native token, ADA, has been experiencing a decline in line with the broader market trend since April 15, after reaching its yearly peak of $0.4620. ADA is trading at $0.2933, reflecting a 1.4% decrease in the past 24 hours. Over the last fourteen days, it has declined nearly 6%.

Bitcoin SV has demonstrated an unparalleled ability to provide transaction throughput on a public PoW blockchain. However, the chain suffers from bad sentiment, miner centralization, bot transactions, and minimal real user adoption. In early February 2023, I wrote Bitcoin: A New War is Beginning . In that article, I theorized that Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) blockchain could result in another block space war. I'd encourage anyone who hasn't read that full piece to read it and consider some of the implications of my takeaways at that time. Since publishing, we did indeed see a spike in fees manifest on the Bitcoin blockchain in early May; though fees have since normalized. But the part of that piece that I feel is applicable to understanding Bitcoin SV ( BSV-USD ) is from the section that detailed the result of Bitcoin's last ""civil war:"" BCH is the product of the last Bitcoin civil war several years ago that consisted of two camps; ""big blockers"" and ""small blockers."" When BTC was originally constructed, there was a 1 megabyte block size limit at launch. This is very small and only allows about 7 transactions per second on the base layer chain. The block space war directly led to the Bitcoin Cash ( BCH-USD ) fork back in 2017. For better or worse, BCH has failed to gain adoption to the degree that BTC has since the fork and I suspect at least some of that failure can be attributed to the emergence of BSV. In 2018, yet another internal war about block space size within the BCH community led to the Bitcoin Satoshi's Vision fork. BSV is a bit of a third rail within the broader crypto community as there has been some debate about one of the network's primary proponents. Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, claims to be Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonymous author of the original Bitcoin white paper. Outside of the BSV community, there is little belief in the claim. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) founder Vitalik Buterin famously referred to BSV as a ""complete scam"" shortly after the fork. While former BTC developer Gavin Andresen, who Satoshi Nakamoto allegedly endorsed before stepping aside from the project, stated he believed Craig Wright is actually Nakamoto. While I'm not going to speculate on the validity of the claim or comment on Andresen or Wright any further in this article, I don't think it's a stretch to say the claim that Wright is Nakamoto has likely had a negative impact on adoption of the Bitcoin SV network overall. Despite that, like other altcoins BSV has caught a bid in recent weeks. As of article submission, BSV has benefited from a significant 50% rally in price from a June low of $23 per coin to current $35 dollar levels. In this article we'll explore some of the key network metrics of the Bitcoin SV blockchain, and I'll assess what I believe is causing the increase in the native coin's price since mid-June. Network Metrics The critical difference between BSV and BCH or BTC is the block size limit of the blockchains where they live. Bitcoin has a block size limit of 4 megabytes (or MB). The block size limit on Bitcoin Cash is 32 MB and the Bitcoin SV block size can often exceed a full gigabyte. This means Bitcoin SV can handle substantially more data transaction throughput per block but that block size potentially comes at the expense of being able to run a node. The major critique of large blocks is that it can lead to centralization which theoretically puts the network at greater risk of a DDOS attack. And this is arguably already a major concern for Bitcoin SV as the total blockchain size is now over 9 million gigabytes. This drastically diminishes the ability to run a node at the individual level, and it has contributed to the centralization of BSV hash rate: BSV Miner Pool Blocks, 1yr (WhatsOnChain) For Bitcoin SV specifically, we can see that mining pool operators has become centralized with just 2 entities accounting for over 81% of the blocks. One of the other potential reasons for this centralization issue in the BSV mining pool is the decline in overall network hash rate: BSV Hash Rate (Viawallet) After a post-fork high of 4 million TH/s, the hash rate on Bitcoin SV has since fallen to about 400k TH/s over the last 2 years. Interestingly, of the ""Bitcoin blockchains,"" the overwhelming majority of total raw transactions happen on Bitcoin SV according to data from Coin Dance: Share of Total Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash Bitcoin SV Hash Rate 99.26% 0.56% 0.11% Network Nodes 97.32% 2.42% 0.25% Transactions 15.06% 7.93% 76.88% Block Sizes 9.68% 3.27% 86.98% Source: Coin Dance However, in my estimation it is highly likely that these are almost entirely bot transactions that don't result in real value transfer. Per data from BitInfoCharts, the median transaction value in USD is generally a penny or less on the Bitcoin SV blockchain. In the past, as much as 98% of the transactions on Bitcoin SV were from a single data harvesting weather app. More recently, it appears that activity is coming from a Swedish website which claims to offer ""student discounts and awesome promotions:"" BSV Block 804664 (WhatsOnChain) I went back several blocks and even sampled various blocks from previous days, and they all generally look the same. Stuk accounts for anywhere between 70-90% of recent BSV transactions in a given block. One of the other apparent BSV transaction contributors is a social payments site called ""centbee:"" Homepage (Centbee) However, when visiting that domain, one is greeted with a virtually unreadable website with graphics and words crashing into each other in an indecipherable manner. In my view, it's unlikely either of these websites are adding much real value to Bitcoin SV or the BSV token. Active Addresses (ViaWallet) Turning to the active addresses on the network, it's difficult to ascertain a real trend given the recent spike on July 10th. For most of July and August, active addresses on Bitcoin SV have typically fallen between 40k and 80k. However, on July 10th, that figure somehow mooned to over 53 million for the day before returning to previous levels on July 11th. Risks For me, the risks with BSV are fairly straightforward. Like all cryptocurrencies, BSV is battling potential regulatory headwinds both in the United States and elsewhere. But beyond the industry-wide risks, Bitcoin SV is struggling from a hash rate centralization problem and a real user problem. The sentiment with the coin is bad in the broader cryptocurrency community and that is unlikely to change in my opinion given how the coin was created and who the primary backers are. Investor Takeaways From where I sit, the most logical explanation for the recent increase in the price of BSV is simply good old fashioned speculation. For me, there are way too many problems with the real adoption of the network to justify going long BSV even as a small speculation. I think there are too many other coins that have better fundamental setups than BSV to justify the opportunity cost of parking capital in a coin that has a lot of obvious red flags. Ultimately, whether one views the tradeoffs that come with any blockchain's technological differences as problematic or not, if said blockchain lacks real adoption, the native coin is going to lack a real economic value through utility. And that's the problem with BSV in a nutshell. It's an avoid for me.",NEUTRAL,BCH | ETH | BSV,BCH | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TRADING | BSV,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4627602-making-sense-of-bitcoin-satoshis-vision?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15922669.jpeg

However, price action has been slow as all major narratives, including those from macroeconomic forces, have lost strength. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024/25: 4-Year Cycle And Elliot Wave Can Coexist As of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $29,300 with sideways movement across the board. Low volatility has been suppressing BTC’s price action, a status quo that could persist until macroeconomic forces come back into the picture in September. Nassim Taleb Lashes Out At Bitcoin Again In the meantime, Bitcoin critics are using the drop in volatility, and trading volume, to support their arguments against the cryptocurrency. Wall Street operator, professor, and author Nassim Taleb stands among the latter. Via his X account, Taleb showed his almost 1 million followers the chart below pointing at the Bitcoin price and the decline in trading volume. Using the chart and the metric as a proxy to gauge Bitcoin adoption, Taleb stated: When I said pple lost interest in bitcoin, it was based on this: BTC Volume is slowly disappearing, down >85% from the peak. As volume drops, manipulations become easier but, at some point, manipulators will need to exit. This is how Open Ponzis implode. The chart above shows BTC declining trading volume since 2020 when the cryptocurrency entered a rally that took it from a low of around $3,000 during a “Black Swan” event, the COVID-19 pandemic, to an all-time high of $69,000. At that time, similar to today, BTC and the crypto market spend years in a “Crypto Winter” with declining prices. Once the sector rallied, many jumped in on the action swelling the trading volume to an all-time high. In that sense, Taleb seems to be hinting at a downside for the price of the cryptocurrency following a rise in price with low trading volume, which often leads to a decline. One crypto investor tried to show Taleb a different version of the chart above, which goes back to 2014 when the cryptocurrency was trading just above $100. The user pointed out that BTC has seen periods of volatile volumes as the cryptocurrency became a mainstream asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Next Leg Lower Underway And At Risk for Key Reasons However, Taleb dismissed the user with the following: Imbecile, if you knew how to read the chart you’d see only now a rise in price WITH DROP in volume.

The attack on July 30 exploited a critical security flaw known as a “reentrancy vulnerability,” allowing malicious actors to drain funds from Curve’s smart contracts. Curve Finance Commits To Restitution Process For Hacked Funds In a significant effort, Curve Finance has successfully retrieved 70% of the funds affected by the hack. While this achievement marks an important milestone, an active investigation is underway to recover the remaining balance and hold the perpetrators accountable. Related Reading: Kraken Surges Ahead In Altcoin Liquidity To Overtake Coinbase In US: Kaiko Understanding the gravity of the situation, Curve Finance has also taken proactive measures to ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the recovered funds to affected users. The protocol is diligently working to measure the respective shares of each impacted account, aiming to facilitate an equitable restitution process that prioritizes user protection and trust restoration. Curve Finance’s recovery efforts are further bolstered by their recent announcement of a $1.85 million bounty. This generous reward will be granted to anyone who can provide accurate information leading to the identification and apprehension of the attackers holding the remaining funds. By offering this substantial bounty, Curve Finance actively encourages community participation and collaboration to expedite the investigation and bring the perpetrators to justice. Curve’s Post-Hack Safety Report Following a thorough investigation, Curve Finance discovered that the exploit primarily targeted the aleth, peth, mseth, and crveth pools. The vulnerability stemmed from a bug within the vyper 0.2.15-0.3.0 version, which the protocol promptly identified as the root cause of the breach. By swiftly pinpointing the issue, Curve Finance was able to take immediate action to mitigate any further risk to its users. Related Reading: Regulatory Pressure Mounts On Worldcoin, Can WLD Price Recover? It is important to note that all other pools on Curve Finance have been confirmed as safe and unaffected by the exploit, according to Curve’s update. This assurance gives users the confidence to continue utilizing the platform, knowing that their funds remain secure within these pools. Alongside the technical remediation, Curve Finance collaborates with security experts, auditors, and the broader DeFi community to conduct thorough audits and implement additional security measures. This collaborative approach aims to reinforce the protocol’s resilience and prevent similar incidents in the future. Overall, Curve Finance’s recovery of 70% of the hacked funds, coupled with its ongoing investigation and bounty initiative, underlines the protocol’s commitment to user protection and the broader DeFi community. According to Token Terminal data, Curve Finance’s circulating market cap currently stands at $518.76 million, reflecting a decrease of 22.29% over the analyzed period. The fully diluted market cap, which represents the potential future market value of the project, is estimated at $1.97 billion. Curve Finance’s total value locked (TVL), a crucial indicator of the protocol’s popularity and user engagement, currently amounts to $2.44 billion. Despite a decline of 35.19% over the analyzed period, Curve Finance maintains a substantial TVL, highlighting its significance within the DeFi landscape.

PayPal’s recent groundbreaking announcement about the launch of its U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin PYUSD has provoked its share of criticism around the world. While it does seem a significant step towards crypto adoption, some say that PayPal won’t see much success any time soon. One of the U.S. largest banks, Bank of America, described the main reasons why PayPal USD is not likely to witness immediate adoption in its recent research report. Competing Against CDBCs First of all, Bank of America’s analysts Alkesh Shah and Andrew Moss explained that the PayPal’s stablecoin might face intense competition on the market: “Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and yield-bearing stablecoins increases.” It is true that numerous countries are actively exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) that could potentially compete with stablecoins as both are based on similar technologies and pegged to fiat currencies. Only this year, countries such as Brazil, South Korea, Russia, Japan, the UK, among others have reported new developments on the rollout of their CBDCs. There are speculations that the U.S. might also be working on its CBDC, even though some of the country’s presidential candidates have claimed to be against it. Competing Against Other Stablecoins Besides, there are many other stablecoins PYUSD will have to compete with. Yield-bearing stablecoins are now especially attractive to investors, according to Bank of America: “Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.” Dealing with Regulatory Scrutiny Finally, the analysts also suggested that PayPal could face regulatory troubles if traditional banks are banned from issuing stablecoins: “Investors are likely indifferent to which stablecoins they hold as long as the stablecoins are perceived as safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms. We do not expect PYUSD’s launch to lead to accelerated regulatory clarity, given the stablecoin’s issuance does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets, but the stablecoin may face regulatory headwinds if non-banks are ultimately barred from stablecoin issuance.” Only a day after PayPal had unveiled its stablecoin project, the U.S. Federal Reserve published new guidelines regarding the use of “dollar tokens” by American banks. According to the statement, in order to engage in any sort of activity linked to stablecoins, the U.S. banks will now have to receive a written supervisory non-objection from the Fed. Meanwhile, crypto scammers didn’t wait long to try and profit from the big news and flooded decentralized exchanges with fake PayPal tokens.

Kaplan made the order to end SBF's bail at a hearing in Manhattan on Friday afternoon, after accusing him of tampering with witnesses, the article said . Specifically, SBF allegedly leaked documents to discredit Caroline Ellison, the ex-CEO of FTX's failed sister firm Alameda Research who has been cooperating with government since December. She is expected to be a key witness for the prosecution. SBF's lawyers was said to have filed an appeal against the judge's ruling and requested a stay on the decision, which Kaplan denied.

42409972,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR7X3,1691781909,Is Friend.tech a Friend or Foe? A Dive Into the New Social App Driving Millions in Trading Volume,"Friend.tech’s invite-only beta launched on Thursday and has done 4,400 ETH (about $8.1 million) in trading volume.  Questions have been raised regarding the project’s founders, its roadmap and its data privacy.  Over the past 24 hours, crypto Twitter has found a new Web3 social app to obsess over.  On Thursday afternoon, friend.tech, a decentralized platform that calls itself “the marketplace for your friends” opened its invite-only beta test. The app essentially allows users to tokenize their social network and is built on Base, crypto exchange Coinbase’s new layer 2 network.  According to a tweet from Yuga Cohler, senior staff software engineer at Coinbase, friend.tech users create a profile to sell “shares” of themself to their followers. At this time, buying someone’s share grants owners the ability to exchange private messages with them.  The platform is courting influencers who already have large Twitter followings, including influencers Jordan Fish, commonly known as Cobie, and pseudonymous trader Hsaka Trades. Yesterday afternoon, Hsaka Trades posted a tweet claiming that the platform would “speedrun into becoming a Cameo type platform for [Crypto Twitter],” allowing users to collect shares for privileges such as sending a tweet from an influencer’s account.  Although the application is nascent, early metrics show its rapid adoption. According to data from Dune analytics, the application has facilitated over 126,000 transactions, and done 4,400 ETH in trading volume since its launch, over $8.1 million. Additional Dune data shows that it outpaced NFT marketplace OpenSea’s trading volume yesterday, doing nearly double the volume of the leading NFT marketplace.  Friend.tech is also taking Base by storm. Early Friday morning, the network reached 136,000 daily active users – overtaking layer 2 network Arbitrum – much of which is attributed to friend.tech users.  ""It's exciting to see apps like friend.tech bring a new spin on social media to Base,” Cohler told CoinDesk. “I think innovation and decentralization in that space is critical, and I'm definitely curious to see what new features friend.tech will roll out in the future.""  That popularity comes with risks. On its first day, the application experienced network outages from the inflow of users as more and more influencers signed up for the platform and many users complained about lag times and the app crashing.  Although friend.tech has experienced exponential growth in the 24 hours since its launch, there are some red flags regarding its origin story, its roadmap and its data privacy.  Where did friend.tech come from?  Cohler’s tweet cited pseudonymous developer Racer as the builder behind friend.tech. He shared that Racer previously created TweetDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization that granted use of its Twitter account by holding a “TweetDAO Egg,” its native non-fungible token (NFT).  “The project went viral before devolving,” said Cohler. “It was one of the first forays into decentralized social media.”  Tweet DAO’s main Twitter account has been suspended and the website linked to from their OpenSea page is also gone. However, another website connected to the DAO is still live, prompting users to connect their wallets to tweet from an alternate Twitter account that has just a few posts from August 2022.  After the hype surrounding TweetDAO faded, Racer returned with another decentralized social platform. Alongside pseudonymous co-founder Shrimp or Shrimppepe, the two developers created Stealcam, a Web3 social platform that allows users to mint images as NFTs, and “steal” them (really, buy them) for ETH.  The catch? The images weren’t visible until purchase.  But in May, the developers decided to rebrand Stealcam to friend.tech, in order to grow its audience among Web3 influencers and creators who want to monetize their content. According to Decrypt, creator earnings in Stealcam had severely dropped off, with leading influencers seeing little returns on their once flourishing content.  Shrimp and Racer told Decrypt that friend.tech was set to launch in “two to four weeks.” They also noted that the platform would deploy on Arbitrum and pointed users to follow @tryfriendtech on Twitter, an account that no longer exists.  Nearly three months later and built on Base, friend.tech has arrived.  You’re selling your shares, are you selling your data?  Crypto influencers flocking to friend.tech are already seeing returns on their shares. But some have raised concerns about how the platform’s pricing model works as well as its data privacy.  Laurence Day, decentralized finance expert and advisor at protocol Euler Finance, posted a Tweet with a share pricing model for friend.tech. According to the model, it’s a simple supply and demand structure. As a user sells more shares, its buy price increases according to a quadratic formula.  Andy Chorlian, founder of shuttered fractionalized NFT trading platform Tessera, joined the application Thursday.  “Never knew friendship was so valuable,” said Chorlian in a tweet, sharing his profile valuation of 47.4 ETH, nearly $88,000. He later clarified that the number was, in fact, a glitch.  Chorlian told CoinDesk that since joining, he’s raked in almost $1,000 in earnings.  “The team there just knows how to make things that [Crypto Twitter] will enjoy,” said Chorlian. “And I have also made like 0.5 ETH, which is honestly insane considering I have just sh*tposted about the app for a bit.”  But beyond buying and selling shares, have expressed concern about how their data would be captured and stored on friend.tech.  The friend.tech desktop site currently directs users to use their mobile device to download the application. The sparse site has very little information on the project, with no information about the roadmap, founders or any sort of whitepaper about the project – all things that most reputable projects would want to have on launch.  There is, however, a call to action that prompts users to read its privacy policy.  But upon clicking on the link, a pop-up sadly tells users that it’s “Coming soon!”  There is also no ability to read the privacy policy on mobile before installing the app from friends.tech. On mobile, the site also forces users to install the app to their home screen, demanding some of the most precious phone real estate.  The lack of any privacy policy should be concerning to users who have no idea where their data may be going, or what it’s going towards.  Overall if you’re considering joining friend.tech, a post from user DefiIgnas sums up the precautions you should take:  Friend.tech’s future  Anytime a new Web3 application touts large returns and community engagement, it’s hard for influencers to stay away. But it’s also crucial to analyze the origins of a project, and understand what its goals are down the line.  Friend.tech is unclear on both of those fronts, which should make users question the long-term viability of sinking money into a half-baked project. From the founders pivoting from two previously failed projects, to a lack of transparency over data usage, users must take into account the potential risks they encounter as the platform continues to scale.  Friend.tech does allow users to cash out their in-app profits. It has a “withdraw ETH” button, allowing creators to send crypto back to their wallets. It might be one of the most reassuring features of the application so far.  Users have noticed a grayed-out icon in the corner of the app, speculating that the project will soon airdrop a native token to its users. But friend.tech has said nothing about an upcoming token and as mentioned, it lacks any roadmap or whitepaper. It’s not safe to assume they’ll follow through with this.  “Do your own research” applies to Web3 the same way it does to the greater crypto industry. Friend.tech’s genesis, mission and lack of roadmap all raise red flags, and must be critically surveyed as it continues to scale.  With a slogan that reads “the marketplace for friends,” the application may not be so friendly after all.

Bankman-Fried faces seven different charges tied to the collapse of FTX, including wire, commodities and securities fraud.  NEW YORK — FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried was sent to jail ahead of his October trial on multiple financial crime charges after a federal judge revoked his release on bond Friday afternoon, saying the former crypto heavyweight appears to have tried to tamper with witnesses.  Bankman-Fried is willing ""to risk crossing the line in an effort to get right up to [the line], wherever it is,"" said Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, later concluding: ""All things considered I'm going to revoke bail.""  He added: ""My conclusion is there is probable cause to believe the defendant has attempted to tamper with witnesses at least twice. … There is a rebuttable presumption that there is no set of conditions that will ensure Bankman-Fried will not be a danger.""  Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman, Bankman-Fried’s parents, were present during the hearing. Fried quietly cried after the judge’s ruling.  Bankman-Fried, the 31-year-old former CEO of crypto exchange FTX , appeared in court on Friday after the U.S. Department of Justice moved to send him back to jail on allegations of violating the terms of his bond by trying to tamper with multiple witnesses. According to the DOJ, Bankman-Fried's reaching out to former FTX.US general counsel Ryne Miller and using a virtual private network to, in the words of his defense team, watch the Super Bowl, were enough to require a modification of his bail conditions. The last straw, however, was Bankman-Fried's sharing part of former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison's private diary with the New York Times.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Could Go Back to Jail Thanks to His Big Fat Mouth  Judge Kaplan cited both attempts to contact former FTX employees in a lengthy verbal order.  While the use of a VPN in and of itself may not be overly significant, it speaks to Bankman-Fried’s mindset, he said.  Bankman-Fried's defense team admitted he shared some diary pages with the Times, though his attorneys disputed that he was trying to tamper with a witness.  “Here we have a very thin record with a lot of spin,” his lawyer told the judge.  The defense team also argued that jailing Bankman-Fried would make it more difficult to prepare for his trial.  Judge Kaplan wasn't convinced by these arguments: ""I don't think that the revocation is quite the insurmountable problem.""     During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon argued that detaining Bankman-Fried was further warranted by the fact that he was increasingly visiting New York for pre-trial conferences and trial preparation.  “He’s effectively unsupervised while he’s here,” she said.  The DOJ also had alternative options in case the judge rejected detaining Bankman-Fried outright. The government would have been OK with home incarceration, banning all visitors and blocking all internet access except for two databases needed to prepare for trial.  This would have included blocking Google Drive, Sassoon said, noting that Ellison’s diary was part of the Drive files Bankman-Fried had access to.  Mark Cohen, Bankman-Fried’s attorney, tried arguing that there was insufficient legal basis to jail him ahead of trial, and that the standards set by precedent cases had not been met.  Read more: Sam Bankman-Fried Will Still Face Campaign Finance-Related Charge, Justice Department Says  “The only reason we know about [Bankman-Fried meeting with a Times reporter] is because he was complying with his bail conditions,” Cohen said.  Sassoon, the prosecutor, disagreed.  “I think the fact the defendant was more subtle in his methods than a mobster doesn’t mean it was benign,” she said.  Bankman-Fried is currently set to go on trial at the start of October on wire fraud, commodities fraud, securities fraud, money laundering and related conspiracy charges. He faces another trial, tentatively scheduled for next March, on additional charges brought by the DOJ after Bankman-Fried's arrest and extradition.  Certain pretrial motions from both the prosecution and the defense are due to the court by Monday, Aug. 14.  Attorneys from both the defense and the prosecution said they were on track to meet next week's deadlines.  Bankman-Fried's lawyers said they would appeal the decision, and motioned to stay the revocation of the bail until that appeal was heard. The judge rejected the stay.  Bankman-Fried's going to jail ahead of his trial does not mean he will go to prison after it. He would need to be found guilty of at least one of the charges laid against him, and sentenced to prison after.  UPDATE (Aug. 11, 2023, 20:15 UTC): Updated with details throughout.

About two weeks back, these holders had been carrying a combined 33% of the circulating supply, but today that value has risen to 41%. “This is a massive ascension and is now the most by far that these sharks and whales have held in well over a year,” notes Santiment. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Volume Remains Extremely High, More Gains Ahead? This accumulation from these key investors has come right after the big plunge that Curve DAO observed, suggesting that they find the current levels a worthy buying opportunity. Naturally, this is a positive sign for the cryptocurrency’s price. The next indicator of interest here is the “whale transaction count,” which keeps track of the total number of CRV transfers happening on the chain carrying a value of more than $100,000. The value of this metric seems to have been relatively low recently | Source: Santiment When Curve Dao had observed its plunge earlier, the value of this indicator had registered a sharp spike. This means that the whales had been actively making moves back then. Since then, however, the metric’s value has returned to normal, suggesting that these humongous investors aren’t showing any extraordinary activity. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Surges, Recovery Being Driven By US Investors? As these investors had made many transfers earlier for selling purposes, the indicator calming down could imply that this cohort has stopped applying selling pressure. “With prices still significantly lower than two weeks ago, a follow-up whale transaction spike may be a foreshadow to a quick recovery,” explains the on-chain analytics firm. CRV has been at relatively high levels recently in terms of the development activity (that is, the amount of work that the Curve DAO developers have been putting into the public GitHub repository). The indicator has seen some high values recently | Source: Santiment Generally, a high development activity implies that the coin is still being backed by its developers, which can be one of the signs to look out for to know if a project is still alive and kicking. Santiment said: By no means is 10-14 notable GitHub submissions per day breaking any records, but it is indicative of a team that is still looking to innovate, improve, and move past the recent FUD news that negatively impacted the crowd’s perceptions of it.

For a moment, the price of XRP reached an astounding $50 per coin before quickly crashing back down to the same level on spot markets on other exchanges. Brief Price Surge On Gemini According to various posts on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), it would seem that Gemini experienced a technical issue that caused the XRP price displayed on their exchange to show an erroneous price of $50. During that time, however, XRP was trading around only $0.63. Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case It would appear as if Gemini is currently experiencing a thin order book after recently relisting XRP on its spot markets. Users have posted screenshots on social media of the token’s price on the exchange rising above $1 several times. However, the exchange has since updated its chart to make it look like the cryptocurrency only spiked to $1.50. Gemini updates XRP chart to reflect $1.50 spike | Source: Gemini The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity. According to crypto trading expert Ali Martinez, the liquidity was so low that only a $37,000 order was enough to move XRP prices on the exchange by 2%. $XRP hit $50 on @Gemini, but now they have updated their charts to make it seems like #XRP hit $1.60. 😅 Still, the market depth on this #crypto exchange is very low.

A price swing of that magnitude seems highly impossible without any major news or event driving widespread interest in XRP. Following this, as of the time of writing, the exchange has announced it has put its platform into full site maintenance. the order book is very thin, i have been watching all day, at one point there was nothing for sale, someone put a lot to sell at $50.00 and someone must have fat fingered a market order and then they were the proud owner of $50 XRP, this was from a few hours ago pic.twitter.com/W5AoG2eV0r — John S (@lifebythedrop63) August 11, 2023 Token price trending at $0.63 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Relisting XRP Gemini is the latest exchange to relist XRP after Ripple’s partial victory in court against the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Due to regulatory concerns, the token was initially delisted on various exchanges after the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020. However, US Judge Analisa Torress ruled in July that XRP sales to the general public are not in violation of federal laws, so many of these crypto exchanges have gone ahead to relist XRP on their platforms. Related Reading: New Milestone For Ethereum Could Spell Good News For ETH Price Other crypto exchanges that have also moved to relist the token since the ruling include Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6311, up by 33.09% in the past month.

42409954,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR6ml,1691774569,Visa Tests Way to Make Paying Ethereum Gas Fees Easier,"Paying fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain is too complicated for most people.  That's the belief of credit-card giant Visa (V). It has completed testing a new way to allow users to pay the fees, known as ""gas fees,"" in fiat currency with their credit card, the company wrote in a blog post on Thursday.  The payments company said blockchain technology could “shape the future of money movement” and has gained significant adoption in the past few years. However, facilitating transactions on-chain remains too complex for most users.  Every time a user conducts a transaction on Ethereum, he or she must pay a gas fee. That includes sending and receiving ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain, over the blockchain. Managing a user's ETH balance to cover those costs is “burdensome,” Visa said in the blog post. Eliminating the complexity could make blockchain-based transactions more accessible and user-friendly, Visa added.  “When comparing the complex nature of blockchain transactions with the simplicity of fiat-based payment transactions supported by the Visa network, it becomes evident that improvement is needed,” Visa said.  To bridge the gap, Visa suggests leveraging Ethereum’s ERC-4337, the current standard that enables smart contracts on the blockchain to serve as wallets via a process called ""account abstraction,"" and a paymaster contract — a smart-contract account that can sponsor gas fees on behalf of the user. The service would allow users to use a Visa card to pay directly for gas fees.  Testing of this process was performed on the Ethereum Goerli ""testnet,"" a test network for Ethereum.  Visa said merchants or decentralized applications could run their paymaster system or use an existing wallet to make transactions easier. The paymaster service providers could also offer a choice of card-based gas fee payment, among other options.  The payments company has been active in the crypto sector for a while, experimenting with different projects. In February, Visa looked into how to convert digital assets into fiat payments.

42409966,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR7Jp,1691773707,Sam Bankman-Fried Could Go Back to Jail Thanks to His Big Fat Mouth,"Update: Judge Lewis Kaplan has now revoked Sam Bankman-Fried's bail and returned him to jail.  Sam Bankman-Fried spent 2021 and much of 2022 talking himself into the role of a cryptocurrency mogul. A court hearing today will decide whether he has now talked himself from cushy house arrest back into a concrete and steel jail cell.  Latest News: FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Jailed Ahead of Trial  The immediate trigger for today’s hearing in the courtroom of District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan was Bankman-Fried’s sharing of the private diary of Caroline Ellison, who Bankman-Fried installed as nominal CEO of FTX and later allegedly ordered to engage in fraud. Prosecutors claim the goal of the leak was to discredit or intimidate Ellison ahead of the trial, when she is expected to testify as a cooperating witness.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But this is merely the straw that broke the camel’s back: Sam Bankman-Fried has been using deceptive public arguments and back-door private communications to manipulate his trial since the moment of FTX’s collapse.  He gave seemingly innumerable interviews and public appearances in the weeks before his arrest. During his house arrest, he has continued to give interviews proclaiming his innocence, though lower-profile. Well before releasing Ellison’s diary, he also allegedly reached out to many of those expected to testify against him.  A Tower of Babble  The public statements, at least, would seem fair enough in a nation underpinned by the principle of free speech. But Bankman-Fried has, not to put too fine a point on it, repeatedly lied in his public statements about what happened. At least from the outside, this has created the appearance of a sustained campaign aimed at poisoning the entire pool of potential jurors with a false narrative — though the view from within Bankman-Fried’s own head is probably a bit rosier.  Far more alarming, though, have been prosecutors’ claims that Bankman-Fried had communicated with former colleagues at Alameda and FTX after his arrest. Given that basically every member of his inner circle has entered a plea deal and agreed to testify against him, a court could reasonably interpret this as witness tampering — an attempt to get them to change their story, whether through intimidation, persuasion or further deception.  This was made even more alarming when it came out that Bankman-Fried had used VPN software, which can obscure a users’ internet activity. Bankman-Fried’s defense team claimed that was to watch a football game, which … look, whatever. The court didn’t buy the NFL Defense either, leading to Bankman-Fried’s current situation: he’s stuck using a flip phone because the court trusts him so little.  All of which led up to Bankman-Fried’s leak of Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times. The portions of the diary highlighted by the Times show Ellison at her lowest, unhappy and overwhelmed in her work. This could be leveraged by Bankman-Fried’s defense team to offload responsibility for the FTX debacle onto Ellison, one of several delusional reframings Bankman-Fried tested out in his post-collapse media tour.  It has become increasingly clear as we sift through the rubble of his misdeeds that Sam Bankman-Fried was never remotely as smart as his most gullible boosters claimed. His seemingly uncontrollable instinct to defy sensible, universal legal advice to simply shut the hell up is yet another piece of evidence against his supposed cleverness.  You see, for most of the time since his arrest in the Bahamas in December 2022, Bankman-Fried has been under house arrest at the home of his parents, Barbara Fried and Joseph Bankman. The home borders on the luxurious, stretching to 3,000 square feet and featuring a pool. It’s not quite a Bahamian polycule penthouse, but it’s probably nicer digs than some FTX victims are enjoying these days. And it’s certainly nicer than the jail cell he could return to after today’s hearing.  Bankman-Fried’s stupidity, though, isn’t just in potentially getting himself sent back to the slammer early: He’s also likely alienating some of the few friends he and his family have left. His initial bail, remember – the gift that let him return to playing “League of Legends” in his bedroom – came from Stanford University faculty members Larry Kramer and Anthony Paepcke, among others.  See also: David Z. Morris – The Faulty Moral Universe of Sam Bankman-Fried | Opinion  Kramer said at the time that he offered to help based entirely on years of friendship with Bankman-Fried’s parents, essentially disregarding the specifics of the case. The FTX saga has further exposed how cynical and transactional the entire Stanford milieu is, but there’s no specific reason to doubt that characterization.  One way of viewing Sam Bankman-Fried’s behavior since being released on bond, then, is as a sign of utter disregard for that generosity and friendship. In return for loyalty and friendship, Bankman-Fried has allegedly violated his bail conditions in the course of attempting to discredit a former romantic partner (and also employee). While things don’t seem likely to go that far, such thoughtlessness could have put Kramer and others’ bail bond funds at risk of forfeit.  The alleged massive theft of billions of dollars from customers who chose to trust him will always be the defining act of Sam Bankman-Fried’s wasted life. But if potential future jurors take one lesson from today’s hearing and its circumstances, it should be that he also considers the people closest to him to be utterly disposable if it serves his interests.",NEGATIVE,없음,REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,David Z.

At first, things went smoothly as the euphoria from the launch grew. But this would only be short-lived because regulators began to pay close attention to Worldcoin’s data collection activities. In the last couple of weeks, regulators in various jurisdictions have brought Worldcoin under a microscope, significantly impacting the price of its native token, WLD. Regulatory Concerns Engulfs Worldcoin Not too long after its launch, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin first raised alarm about Worldcoin’s technology. According to Buterin, there were major privacy and security concerns, highlighting that user data collected using Worldcoin’s orbs could be prone to abuse. Related Reading: Terra Classic (LUNC) Chances Of Revival Grow Slimmer, Here’s Why Following this, reports emerged of some people getting less technologically savvy residents to scan their iris at Kenyan orb locations and then paying them one-third of the 25 WLD token rewards for doing so. In light of this, the Kenyan government launched a crackdown on the firm, leading to a temporary pause of its activities in the country. Worldcoin’s problems didn’t end there as Germany’s Bavarian State Office for Data Protection Supervision (BayLDA) also launched an investigation. The regulator’s concern centered on Worldcoin’s data processing practices and how it was transferring information. Most recently, the company has come under fire in Argentina where regulators are currently investigating its operations in the country. This is in addition to regulators in the United Kingdom and France also questioning Worldcoin’s data handling practices. Can WLD Price Recover From This? In light of the increased regulatory scrutiny around Worldcoin, its native WLD token has naturally suffered. WLD’s price has been on a consistent decline following its initial price pump on launch day, falling double-digits in the last few weeks. With so many investigations into the activities of the company, it is likely that this downtrend will continue. And if lawsuits were to result from these investigations, then WLD price could suffer the same fate as XRP following the SEC lawsuit back in 2020. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Next In Line For A Rally Following Shark And Whale Buying Spree Interestingly, the daily trading volume of WLD is up 44% in the last day. This signals growing interest in the coin which could lead to a price recovery. But such a recovery would only be short-lived as long as the uncertainties surrounding Worldcoin remain. Over the last 24 hours, the price of WLD has fallen 6.79% to trade at 1.7 at the time of this writing. It is recording losses of 25.64% on the weekly chart, but meager gains of 1.72% on the 30-day chart.

42409965,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR7GW,1691770589,PayPal’s Stablecoin Is No Libra. Why the Timing Feels Right,"This week, Rep. Maxine Waters, (D-California) declared she was “deeply concerned” with payments giant PayPal (PYPL) for launching a stablecoin under the New York Department of Financial Services regulatory framework before federal legislation addressing such crypto instruments has been debated. The moment had echoes of the battle over the doomed Libra project, which Waters also vehemently opposed.  But the circumstances are quite different from four years ago, when Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms (META), rolled out a basket-based stablecoin to a barrage of regulator criticism around the world. The attacks were so heavy that they ultimately stymied Libra’s advance, leaving it to wither and die, even after a radical redesign intended to appease regulators and a name change to Diem.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Libra was one of those rare issues that generated bipartisanship — in opposition to the project, rather than for it — in part because at that time other concerns about Facebook’s treatment of user data had turned it, briefly, into a pariah for politicians.  By contrast, the stablecoin industry now seems to have won over a decent number of backers in Congress, mostly from one side. Last month, House Republicans successfully pushed stablecoin legislation through the House Financial Services Committee. And, while its passage was more contentious than many had hoped, with Waters herself leading Democrat resistance, the bill seems likely to win support in the Republican-controlled House when it goes to a floor vote.  PayPal has now complicated the outlook for this bill’s passage through the Senate. I tend to agree with observers, cited in a piece by CoinDesk’s Jesse Hamilton this week, who argued that PayPal, in upsetting Democrats by jumping the gun on the legislation, will harden the resolve of the party’s anti-crypto crusaders in the Senate, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts). And that could halt the bill’s passage in the upper chamber, where Warren’s party controls the majority.  But in the grand scheme of things, PayPal’s project is in a far stronger position politically than the universally mistrusted Libra ever was. Republicans are thrilled that the payments company launched its stablecoin, known as PYUSD, at this moment. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina), chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, called the move a “clear signal that stablecoins — if issued under a clear regulatory framework — hold promise as a pillar of our 21st-century payments system” and made it “more important than ever” to keep moving the legislation forward.  Just as importantly, PayPal’s move follows a slew of initiatives from financial establishment players to prod policymakers to support their own engagement in the crypto industry. BlackRock (BLK), Fidelity Investments, Invesco and many more are now pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to support newly revived submissions seeking approval of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Meanwhile, Charles Schwab (SCHW), Fidelity and Citadel are jointly seeking regulatory approval for a new crypto exchange. These institutions do their homework in Washington before going down paths like this, as does PayPal.  Read more: David Z. Morris - PayPal’s Real Stablecoin Strategy: It Wants to Earn Interest on Your Deposits  People are rightfully concerned about the polarization and politicization of the crypto debate. But with six Democrats — a surprisingly large number — breaking ranks in the House Financial Services Committee to support a separate McHenry-sponsored bill that creates a broad regulatory framework for crypto, the risk of gridlocked stalemate mightn’t be as high as feared, especially given the clout of the companies now showing their support for the industry.  The other factor in PayPal’s favor is that, unlike Libra, it is offering up a dollar-only stablecoin, which could boost demand for the U.S. currency around the world and that it doesn’t have nearly the same global footprint as Facebook had at the time of the Libra launch. Libra’s first iteration was a token pegged to a multicurrency basket, which many policymakers saw as a threat to monetary sovereignty. They feared that, if Facebook’s billions of users shifted to using the token, it would directly diminish demand for their domestic currencies.  PayPal may well face some grandstanding opposition from Democrats and that might hold up legislation. But it’s hard to see this development as being on the wrong side of history. Sooner rather than later, stablecoins will enjoy a constructive regulatory framework in the U.S. and that could spur a dramatic change in money that newcomers like PayPal and old-timers like Tether and Circle will be well placed to exploit.",NEUTRAL,PYUSD,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | USDT | PYUSD,Michael J.

In terms of the 7 days price gain, the meme coin is outperforming other notable assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE), representing less than 1% price increase. Investors and enthusiasts are now considering whether to buy in as the project’s new development unfolds. SHIB Price Gains Momentum As Shibarium Nears A recent examination of on-chain data by IntoTheBlock exposed a remarkable rise in transactions related to SHIB ranging from $100,000 to $1 million, demonstrating an astounding surge of 300% over the last month. The current upward movement can also be linked to a post by the main developer, Shytoshi Kusama, on July 31. Related Reading: Solana Cuts Saga Price By 40%, But Case For New SOL Yearly High Increases He stated that the launch of Shibarium is fast approaching, prompting the need to “mint the remaining supply of BONE and renounce the BONE contract.” Recall that the lead developer of Shiba Inu, Shytoshi Kusama, mentioned in a blog post on July 6 that the team plans to talk about and maybe launch Shibarium, the awaited layer 2 technology, at the ETHToronto and ETHWomen hackathons in Canada in August 2023. He also shared a statement directly on the X application: “Here’s a math equation for those who like math. I won’t make it long: Shib > X.” Going by his timeline, the eagerly anticipated release of the Layer 2 Shibarium will be on August 15-16 as part of the ETH Toronto event. Launching the long-awaited Shibarium will likely boost investors’ interest and hype within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. After Shibarium is launched, more people could want to invest in the $SHIB token, as it might create a new wave of excitement. Technical Indicators Signal Bullish Momentum As the Shibarium launch nears, the coin experienced bullish sentiment evident in the 4-green candles on the daily chart. According to the chart, SHIB/USDT has approached the upper Bollinger Bands indicator, suggesting a high bullish pressure. The upper Bollinger Band is a resistance level, indicating that the coin’s price might be challenging to sustain further upward movement without a pullback. A breach of the upper Bollinger Band could signal a continuation of the uptrend, but if the price fails to break through and starts to decline, it might indicate the beginning of a retracement. With the RSI level at 69, the coin’s price might hover in the overbought territory, suggesting a potential slowing down or a reversal. However, the MACD above the signal line indicates positive momentum and potential upward movement. So the RSI indicates that the coin might be due for a corrective pullback, but the MACD suggests there is still buying interest. Related Reading: Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case Considering the analysis, the coin could observe a period of consolidation or a minor dip before a potential continuation of the upward trend. Traders should closely monitor price action, especially around key support levels at $0.0000077, and be prepared for potential short-term volatility. As of today, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00000105. According to CoinGecko statistics, it has advanced by 18% & 24% over the last 7 and 14 days, respectively.

Challenge for Creating a Digital Asset Repository Due to a reported rise in crypto-related illegal activities across the country, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and Shared Services Canada (SSC) are pursuing a solution that can facilitate the seizure and storage of digital assets such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on various blockchains, according to the statement of August 10, 2023. “The RCMP requires the ability to safely and securely store digital assets that have been seized and retained, until their eventual disposition at the conclusion of any legal proceedings. The development of a centralized repository solution would allow police officers to seize these assets in a user friendly manner, while also offering significant security to prevent the theft of said assets during their storage,” reads the statement. The authorities dare the Canadian innovative developers to come up with a safe digital asset repository that would help the police seize and safeguard stolen assets, in an effort to decrease cryptocurrency frauds. The RCMP outlines fourteen mandatory and three desirable features a proposed solution should have. The primary considerations require the repository to be able to accept and process transactions on the top 20 cryptocurrency networks by market capitalization, as well as onboard and support new blockchains in the future. Other demands on the list include a native Android application; secure processes to protect assets and dispose of them if needed; daily automated verification and notifications on asset transfers; clear instructions on seizing assets for officers; and more. The RCMP also listed three NFT blockchains that must be supported by the system at this stage – Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon. Participants of the challenge can submit their idea until September 21, 2023. Up to four contracts for Phase 1 could result from the challenge. Then, only two eligible businesses will be invited to submit a proposal for Phase 2. Combatting Cryptocurrency-Related Crimes The main reason behind the development of the digital asset repository is the surge of crypto-related activities in Canada: “With the rise of new and innovative methods to store and transfer assets, Canadian Law enforcement needs a safe and secure method to identify and seize said assets. As cryptocurrency continues to gain popularity as a transaction method and store of value in the general population, it continues to be used as a payment method for criminal activities. With ransomware/malware attacks and online scams making up the majority of these transactions. This challenge aims to leverage the private sectors innovation to develop a system used by the police to seize and store the ill-gotten gains from these criminal activities.” It’s important to note that Canada is not the only country that experiences a rise in crimes linked to digital assets. For example, the FBI in the US has also recently reported numerous scams related to cryptocurrencies and NFTs, with one of the recent cases resulting in the loss of staggering $9million. Besides, other countries are also looking for effective ways to deal with crypto crimes. One of the latest examples is a multi-agency investigation unit established by South Korea.

As Borroe Finance continues its presale, the crypto community is excited over the potential of its native token, $ROE, to outperform even the mighty Ethereum. At the heart of Borroe Finance lies its innovative marketplace, where businesses can mint Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) representing future revenue streams and outstanding invoices. These NFTs are then sold at a discount, enabling Web3 startups to access upfront cash quickly and efficiently. The platform's AI-driven risk assessment and automated process ensure transparency, security, and timely funding, building confidence among investors and paving the way for the $ROE token to shine. What further sets Borroe Finance apart is its commitment to regulation and best practices. The project proactively seeks regulatory compliance, ensuring that it operates within legal frameworks and safeguards consumer welfare. This strategic approach provides a solid foundation for investors, offering peace of mind and reducing potential risks associated with regulatory uncertainty. One of the standout features of Borroe Finance is its recent smart audit by BlockAudit, a top auditing firm renowned for its thorough analysis of blockchain projects. This audit underscores the project's commitment to security and trustworthiness, a vital factor in today's crypto landscape. With the assurance of a reputable audit, $ROE's appeal as a safe investment option is further amplified. As the crypto community looks ahead to an exciting future, $ROE presents an enticing entry point for investors seeking exposure to the Web3 revolution. Borroe Finance's experienced team, innovative solutions, and commitment to regulation make it an attractive choice for those looking to capitalize on the next big wave in the cryptocurrency market.

In a recent tweet, Bluntz highlighted a nearly year-long wedge formation in the ETH/BTC trading pair, which he believes sets the stage for a ""glorious"" breakout. The trader expressed optimism and signaled that the breakout might already be underway, suggesting a bullish target price of over 0.07 BTC (approximately $2,101). His prediction challenges the status quo, as he believes that many market participants are underprepared for Ethereum's potential upswing, making them vulnerable to a significant price movement. Notably, Bluntz believes that Ethereum's bullish momentum has the potential to drive the price to an impressive high of 0.112 BTC (approximately $3,362). This projection represents a substantial leap from Ethereum's current level of $1839. Investors and enthusiasts alike are eagerly watching Ethereum's price action, anticipating a ""glorious"" breakout and the potential for outsized gains continue to drive excitement within the crypto market. As Ethereum's breakout scenario unfolds, $ROE's journey to outperforming ETH becomes an exciting narrative investors can't overlook. This is because, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, Ethereum's price movements often serve as a barometer for the broader market sentiment. Ethereum's significant moves can trigger other altcoins to surge even harder and outperform the leader.

A recent report shows that Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) TVL have seen an upsurge. A new project, Pomerdoge (POMD), has shown potential, but can it keep up in the highly competitive cryptocurrency world? Click Here To Find Out More About The Pomerdoge (POMD) Presale Ethereum and Cardano TVL Explodes The TVL metric is often used to judge the growth of a DeFi network. Recent reports from Messari have shown that the TVL of Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA) has been on the rise despite the bearish crypto market. According to Messari, the TVL of Cardano has increased by 198.6% year-to-date (YTD). Cardano now has more than $175 million locked in its DeFi ecosystem. The increase in TVL has helped Cardano move from the 34th position to the 21st in overall TVL across all blockchains. Messari links the growth of Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem to the launch of stablecoins, improved programming languages, and new wallets. On the other hand, Ethereum still dominates the DeFispace as the leading network. At the time of this writing, Ethereum has more than $23.5 billion in TVL. The explosive growth of Cardano and Ethereum is considered impressive due to the recent price drop in crypto prices. With the prices of Ethereum and Cardano forecasted to recover by the end of 2023, the TVL locked in their respective chains could increase further. Can Pomerdoge (POMD) Catch Up in the DeFi Space?

42409976,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR7gy,1691767800,Campaign-Finance Charges Are Back on the Menu,"I didn’t really have anything prepared to write about this week, but the Department of Justice is on it. Prosecutors told the judge overseeing Sam Bankman-Fried’s criminal trial that they intend to fold campaign-finance allegations into a wire fraud charge, after announcing they would have to drop the campaign-finance charge itself due to treaty obligations with the Bahamas.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  Campaign finance  The narrative  We are back in court on Friday as Sam Bankman-Fried learns whether he will have to report to jail ahead of his trial that's scheduled for October.  Why it matters  This hearing could provide a view into Judge Lewis Kaplan’s thoughts on Bankman-Fried’s activities over the past few months, as well as hint at what we may see when the trial itself begins.  Breaking it down  First off: Please allow me to quote myself:  ""That doesn’t mean the U.S. Department of Justice is letting the FTX founder off on alleged criminal conduct, however — and campaign-finance charges could still be tried later.""  Well now we know that the Justice Department does indeed want to bring the campaign-finance allegations, and it’s not going to let not being able to charge the specific statute be a barrier to doing so.  I suspect there are about 196 reasons why the Justice Department might want to dive more deeply into this specific set of allegations.  Bankman-Fried’s team hasn’t yet responded to this week's letter from the Justice Department, but we are going to hear from them later on Friday when the former FTX CEO shows up in court to learn whether he will be sent back to jail ahead of his trial in October.  Obviously, I’ve written about this before, and so I'm not going to get too deep into it now, but here are the highlights: Bankman-Fried is accused of violating his bond conditions in trying to tamper with multiple witnesses as well as of other shady behavior. The Justice Department says that he has abused his privilege in being allowed to spend his pretrial time at his parents’ home, and therefore, it wants to put him back into custody.  The defense claims that Bankman-Fried has done nothing improper, although his lawyers admitted that he did indeed share his former girlfriend's diary with the New York Times. They say that jailing Bankman-Fried would make it far more difficult for him to prepare for trial and therefore receive a fair trial.  Still, the odds don't appear to be on his side at this moment. Kaplan, U.S. district judge who is presiding in this case, notably ended the last hearing with Bankman-Fried by directly warning the defendant to take the proceedings seriously. It didn't sound like a casual warning from a judge to any defendant but a specific one to a defendant who he has already once said may have conducted criminal activity.  Bankman-Fried will be at the New York District courthouse in Manhattan at 2 p.m. Eastern this afternoon. CoinDesk will be there of course, providing updates.

The latest data reveals Kraken, the California-based crypto exchange, is now dominating its rivals, specifically Coinbase, in the altcoin market. Dominating The Altcoin Trading Landscape Data analytics from crypto research firm Kaiko has highlighted Kraken’s emergence as the premier US crypto exchange for altcoin trading. With significant shifts in market depth percentages and a notable increase in market share, Kraken appears to be carving out a niche for itself in an otherwise volatile industry. 📈🤔In July, Kraken emerged as the most liquid platform for alts in the US. 👉 Its claiming almost half of the market depth for the top 10 alts. pic.twitter.com/2fumt7yi9a — Dessislava Ianeva (@DessislavaIane2) August 9, 2023 Related Reading: Gateway Issues Cause Withdrawal And Deposit Delays For Kraken Exchange Market depth is a crucial metric for crypto exchanges as it represents an exchange’s capability to manage large buy or sell orders without causing drastic price changes. And according to recent data from Kaiko, Kraken now commands roughly 47% of the market depth for the top 10 altcoins. This dominance, especially in the wake of the previous year’s price drop and the unfortunate collapse of FTX, underscores the resilience Kraken has brought to the altcoin trading sector. While the entire crypto trading industry has been grappling with declining trading volumes, Kraken has managed to hold its own. A steady uptick in its market share is evident as it jumped from 8.3% in August 2022 to 21.1% in July, according to data from The Block’s dashboard. Behind Kraken Ascendancy Kraken reportedly attributes this upward trajectory to a few specific improvements in its offerings. Notably, the introduction of Kraken Pro, their advanced trading platform which rolled out in December, is believed to be a pivotal move. A spokesperson for the crypto exchange elaborated on the exchange’s recent performance, pointing out that their “share of total volumes has hit an 18-month high.” Furthermore, there’s been a significant surge in their share of EUR spot markets, rising from 35% to 53%, and the AUD spot markets have seen exponential growth, multiplying sixfold over the past year. Related Reading: Regulators Are To Blame For All The Crisis In Crypto, Says Kraken CEO Despite the laudable progress, it’s crucial to note that Kraken, like many others in the industry, has felt the effects of the industry-wide decline in trading volumes.

The SEC published an order calling for public input on the Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF application, a standard move that pushes any decision by another several weeks. The SEC has a total of 240 days to make a final decision on an application after it starts reviewing one. The SEC is giving the general public three weeks to weigh in on the proposal itself, and an additional five weeks to respond to those initial slate of comments.  ""In sum, the Exchange believes that this proposal is consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, that this filing sufficiently demonstrates that the CME Bitcoin Futures market represents a regulated market of significant size, and that on the whole the manipulation concerns previously articulated by the Commission are sufficiently mitigated to the point that they are outweighed by investor protection issues that would be resolved by approving this proposal,"" the filing said. .  Ark Investment Management and 21Shares, which have been seeking an ETF approval since 2021, filed for their first potential bitcoin ETF applications again earlier this year after a second effort was rebuffed by the SEC. The SEC has rejected spot bitcoin ETF products on grounds of potential market manipulation and inadequate investor protections against harmful activity.  If an ETF is approved, it would give a broader swath of the general investing public access to trading and holding bitcoin's value without having to hold the digital asset itself.  Cathie Wood, Ark Invest's CEO, told Bloomberg on Monday that she expected a delay in a decision on her firm's application, but that the SEC will ultimately approve several applications simultaneously.  ""Because most of these essentially will be the same, it will come down to marketing, communicating, the message"" to see how they do, she said. ""We're trying to get the word out there that our research is deep, and we've been doing it since 2015.""  However, Scott Farnin, the legal counsel at consumer advocacy group Better Markets, said in a statement ahead of the SEC's decision that the regulator should reject the bitcoin ETF applications outright, saying the surveillance-sharing agreements set up in proposals were ""wholly inadequate.""  ""The spot bitcoin markets (1) have a history of artificially inflated trading volumes due to rampant manipulation and wash trading; (2) are highly concentrated; and (3) rely on a select group of individuals and entities to maintain bitcoin’s network,"" Farnin said. ""These are features of the bitcoin network that make a proposed spot bitcoin-based ETP extremely vulnerable to manipulation by bad actors, posing unnecessary risks to investors and the public interest. The proposed rule changes offer little to neutralize these threats.""  Bitcoin (BTC) popped about $100 on the news but quickly came back to about $29,500.

Support From Industry Bigwigs The $5 million investment from Binance Labs in the CRV token is part of a strategic deal under which Curve will explore deployment to the BNB Chain. With $2.4 billion in total value locked (TVL) and a daily volume of $215 million, Curve is the second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX). CRV, the Ethereum-based utility token of the Curve DeFi protocol, serves as a linchpin for exchanging stablecoins and other ERC-20 tokens, alongside staking, boosting, and governance voting. The DeFi platform was recently hit by a severe re-entrancy exploit that robbed it of over $60 million worth of funds from its liquidity pools. It affected Curve even further as several exchanges withdrew their support for the CRV token from their platforms. Binance Labs’ investment in the CRV token has somewhat reversed that effect, acting as a vote of confidence. The platform has also received support from other crypto bigwigs, like Justin Sun and DCF God. Binance Labs' Forward-Thinking Approach Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, underscored the partnership's significance, stating, ""Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi, it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration. We view this cooperation as a starting point and look forward to working together to further propel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem."" Strategic Amalgamation for BNB Chain Boost Curve's multi-chain presence, capitalizing on speed and cost efficiency, is set to expand with its planned deployment to BNB Chain. This strategic move aims to bolster the growth of the BNB Chain DeFi ecosystem, amplifying its influence in the DeFi landscape. Curve founder Michael Egorov noted, ""BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi, and is well positioned to deploy Curve's current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem."" The integration of Curve onto the BNB Chain will enhance scalability paving the way for handling more transactions and catering to the escalating user demand.

The native token of the blockchain rallied 20% in response. Bears are fading the move and funding rates dropped to an all-time low following the news. There is a possible squeeze setup at play despite a 2% supply unlock on August 11th, but I'd avoid this coin entirely. If you have found yourself bidding altcoins in recent weeks, you're not alone. While Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) hasn't moved all that much, there are numerous cryptocurrencies that have rallied between 15-25% in the last month. One of the assets in the space that has seen a notable surge higher recently is the native token of the Aptos ( APT-USD ) blockchain. APT 5 Day Performance (Seeking Alpha) After an initial 20% intraday spike on from low to high on August 9th, APT has given back roughly half the gain but is largely holding a 10% increase since early August. The entirety of that positive performance in APT has come in reaction to an announcement from Aptos' lead developer Aptos Labs. That announcement highlighted what the Aptos team has called a partnership with Microsoft ( MSFT ): Today, we're making Aptos history. @AptosLabs is partnering with @Microsoft to unlock Web3 on the @Aptos_Network. As an @msPartner, our joint suite of AI-supported tools will offer developers and users around the world effortless access to Web3. Critics of Aptos, of which you can consider me one , were quick to point out that use of the word ""partnership"" might be taking liberties with language. Some have claimed it might be more accurate to say the Aptos team is integrating a Microsoft product with the Aptos network rather than partnering directly with the corporation. But quotes in Fortune from Microsoft's general manager of A.I. and emerging technologies Rashmi Misra seem to corroborate the notion that there is a mutually beneficial relationship between the entities: The intersection of A.I. and blockchain is one of the most interesting combinations of emerging technologies. By fusing Aptos Labs’ technology with the Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service capabilities, we aim to democratize the use of blockchain. However, this quote mirrors similar sentiment from Misra earlier this year in an announced partnership with blockchain infrastructure protocol Ankr ( ANKR-USD ). From where I sit, it's too early to tell what, if any, fruit will be born from this Aptos/Azure integration. APT Pumps: A Brief History Aptos is a relatively new blockchain so there isn't a large trading history for the APT token. However, the last time there was a large pump in the price of APT, I covered the logic behind the move in a Seeking Alpha article . At that time, I concluded the following: There is absolutely no reason for this as far as I can see. I would be very careful chasing anything in the crypto industry right now, let alone new protocol coins that have poor tokenomics, poor sentiment, and poor levels of activity. Aptos is the latter. I called it a hold in October, and that was probably being generous. Today, APT is a sell, in my view. Since then, APT has declined by roughly 60% while network usage has actually picked up a bit since my January coverage: 30 Day User Trend (Aptos Labs) While still well below many other leading L1 smart contract chains, daily active accounts on Aptos have noticeably picked up in recent weeks from the 30k range seen earlier this year to over 100k in mid-July. New accounts created have generally held steady in the 85-95k range on a daily basis. However, despite these apparent increases in chain usage, real APT volume has remained near all-time lows. Though we do see a clear recent exception following the Microsoft announcement: Real Volume (Messari) Over the last several months, APT volume has held relatively firm between $25 to $30 million on a daily basis. Volume spiked to $216 million on August 9th following the Microsoft announcement. Other Considerations This spike in APT volume could theoretically be attributable to demand for the token for on-chain usage. However, what is probably more likely is the volume surge is due primarily to news-related speculation. Digging into the derivative market data from Coinglass, we can see a collapse in the volume-weighted funding rate following the partnership announcement: Coinglass The volume-weighted funding rate of -0.0397% on August 9th would be a record low for APT and an indication that bears are piling on positions in anticipation of a drop in the coin's price. It should be noted that a funding rate this extreme could actually work against bears if the price of APT moves higher and they're forced to cover. A fall in price could be seen as a fairly logical expectation given another unlock event that will see 4.5 million APT tokens vest on August 11th. APT Unlock (Token Unlocks) However, in the grand scheme of things this might not necessarily be a large selling event as the 4.5 million APT coins amount to a little over 2% of the circulating supply. Given the enormous level of emissions that are still coming for APT for the remainder of the year, I don't know that 4.5 million coins on August 11th will be the straw that breaks the camel's back for APT. For example, after the July 11th unlock, APT actually rallied from $6.85 up to $8.18 one week later. Closing Thoughts There are signs Aptos is being used more than it had been in previous months. Bears are clearly betting against a rise in the token's price and one could conceivably argue that trade has become one-sided immediately following the Microsoft announcement. Even though I still believe APT has terrible tokenomics and I have serious doubts about the Aptos blockchain going forward, tactical traders might be able to find an opportunity to squeeze bears temporarily if history repeats from the July unlock. Of course, the argument could also be made any post-unlock gains have already been made and given back. In my view, it's best to sit this one out and watch from the sidelines. As mentioned above, there are other blockchain-based infrastructure projects that have a ""partnership"" with Microsoft and with arguably much less hype. As a long term investment, APT is still a definite avoid for me.",NEUTRAL,APT,ALTCOIN | BLOCKCHAIN | ICO | TRADING | APT,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4627351-aptos-and-microsoft-partnership-or-hype-piece?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15910108.jpeg

Activity on Base is tied to Friend.Tech, a social network, rumored to be releasing a token airdrop.  About $175 million has been bridged to Base since inception.  Frenzied activity around Friend.Tech, a social network platform built on Coinbase's (COIN) layer 2 blockchain Base, has driven daily active users to a record high of 136,000, according to Dune Analytics.  Following a modest public release on Wednesday that saw just $10 million in fresh inflows during its first day as a live blockchain, Base has now overtaken rival layer 2 blockchain Optimism in terms of daily active users and is not that far from Arbitrum's total of 147,000, according to tokenterminal data.  A total of $175 million in cryptocurrencies has been transferred to Base since its inception, with almost 580,000 transactions recorded on Thursday.  Much of that has been attributed to Friend.Tech, a new social network that allows users to purchase or sell shares tied to popular Twitter figures.  The app is in beta mode and can be accessed only with a valid sign-up code. A grayed-out section at the top of the app suggests the platform will release a token, spurring a flurry of activity as users attempt to farm a potential airdrop by sharing referral codes.  The platform's servers experienced downtime on Thursday following a surge in sign-ups.

42409975,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR7kH,1691756771,First Mover Americas: A 'Head-and-Shoulders' Case for Altcoins,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  A bullish inverse head-and-shoulders price pattern is building in the combined market capitalization of altcoins. The term “altcoin” is short for “alternative coin” and, in this case, refers to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin, ether and top stablecoins. A potential completion of the pattern would signal ""alt season,"" or outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies relative to bitcoin and ether, according to technical analysis by Josh Olszewicz, a crypto trader and former researcher at Valkyrie Investments. Olszewicz analyzed the charts of altcoins, excluding ether and prominent stablecoins. The inverse head-and-shoulders, one of the most trusted bullish technical analysis patterns in the market, forms when an asset chalks out three price troughs, with the middle one being the lowest. A breakout or a bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed once prices rise above the trendline (neckline), connecting the peaks between the lows.  Crypto exchange Bittrex settled charges of offering U.S. investors access to unregistered securities on Thursday, agreeing to pay a $24 million fine within two months of filing a liquidation plan for the exchange. The SEC sued Bittrex, which filed for bankruptcy in May, earlier this year, saying it simultaneously operated a securities exchange, broker and clearinghouse without registering itself as such. The SEC has brought similar charges against fellow crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN) and Binance.US. The SEC further alleged that Bittrex directed crypto issuers to delete public statements that could suggest their tokens might violate securities law.  Inflows to Coinbase’s new Base blockchain were muted on the first day after its official launch, failing to meet the expectations of some crypto traders that massive amounts of capital would flow in. Just over $10 million was transferred to the new blockchain in the past 24 hours, according to data in a Dune Analytics dashboard, with just over 15,000 new users and 40% fewer transactions than Wednesday. Of that amount, $5.6 million was in the form of ether, $2.3 million in USD coin (USDC) and the rest in alternative cryptocurrencies. Wallet analysis shows most Base users transferred between $500 to $1,000 worth of ether on average.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the average yield on 100 of the largest money-market funds has jumped to over 5%, reaching its highest level since 2007.  The attractive yield offered by the so-called cash-equivalents means macro traders have less incentive to add exposure to risky assets like tech stocks and cryptocurrencies.  — Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  XRP's Market Cap Momentarily Zoomed to Trillions of Dollars on Gemini  Shiba Inu Bucks Bitcoin Snoozefest Ahead of Shibarium Deployment  Metaverse Platform Sandbox Transferred Out 60M SAND Ahead of Monday's $133M Token Unlock",NEUTRAL,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,"Lyllah Ledesma, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/11/a-head-and-shoulders-case-for-altcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3fc2d9eadff9384db7ea8bfa265b17ed45417751-811x393.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

This move comes just four months after the phone’s launch, sparking a flurry of reactions from the crypto community. The official statement from the company suggests that the price cut is a strategic move to foster wider adoption of mobile web3 and to enhance the user experience for the Solana mobile community. However, on-chain data paints a slightly different picture. According to data compiled by Flipside Crypto, sales of the Solana Saga have seen a sharp decline since their peak in April and May. This is evidenced by the number of Saga Genesis NFT mints, which are generated when a user sets up their Solana Saga smartphone and accesses the Solana app store. The chart below shows a clear downward trend of sales. Since June sales volume has been extremely flat after a successful May 2023. The price reduction has elicited mixed reactions on Twitter / X. While some early adopters expressed their frustration at purchasing the device at its original price, others defended the move, pointing out the benefits of being an early bird. Notably, early owners had the exclusive opportunity to mint Claynosaurz NFTs, which currently have a floor price of around 33 SOL on Magic Eden, translating to over $800. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Leads Gains Among Top Coins, Is $30 Milestone Possible? Solana (SOL) Price Analysis On the flip side, the Solana (SOL) token is in bullish territory. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $24.38. A look at the daily chart shows that SOL was able to confirm the breakout from its downtrend channel on Monday after the price found support at both the channel’s trend line and the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). As a result of this bullish confirmation, SOL broke above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $23.94. For now, it looks like SOL can defend the level and make a new run towards the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $27.42. Related Reading: Solana Beats Out Ethereum To Emerge As Best Performer In Terms Of TVL Remarkably, on July 14, SOL reached its year-to-date peak of $32.36 and recoiled from the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level. Subsequently, SOL dipped below the 61.8% Fibonacci level and couldn’t sustain a daily close above it. Given this context, the $27.42 price point emerges as the most pivotal resistance currently. Should a breakout occur, a clear path to the year’s high would be established. In this case, a bullish breakout seems imminent. However, strong profit taking can be expected around $32.36. If the yearly high falls, though, the bulls could target the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level at $56.86.

Futures ETF Filings,"Summary The environment for crypto-related ETFs looks significantly different from early 2023 when several crypto ETFs announced closures. Recently, there’s been a rush among issuers to file for spot bitcoin ETFs, followed shortly by a rush to file for ether futures ETFs. Here we discuss common questions around the recent ether futures ETFs filings and what this could mean for spot bitcoin ETFs. After a rush among issuers to file for spot bitcoin ETFs, followed shortly by a rush to file for ether futures ETFs, the environment for crypto-related ETFs looks significantly different from early 2023 when several crypto ETFs announced closures. What has changed since then, and what does this all mean for crypto ETFs? Today’s note discusses common questions around the recent ether futures ETFs filings and what this could mean for spot bitcoin ETFs. What’s different now from earlier this year? 2022 was brutal for crypto. Many retail investors who flocked to Bitcoin and crypto investments in 2020 were burned after Bitcoin prices declined by around 64%. It dragged down most other crypto-related investments with it. The decline was due to several high-profile bankruptcies and crashes. This includes Celsius Network, Terra Luna, and the more recent collapse of FTX in November 2022. Bitcoin prices started 2023 off at lows so the eventual recovery led to Bitcoin price rising 76% YTD. Bitcoin futures ETFs like the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF ( BITO ) were up 75%, and crypto equity ETFs, which were down even more in 2022, outperformed the entire equity ETF universe YTD. But despite significant returns (+228% in the case of WGMI ), investors shied away from even these funds. And several crypto ETFs closed in early 2023, including RIGZ, BTCR, and DAM. I believe that many retail investors were uninterested in crypto after losing money in 2022. They were not tempted even with the possibility of high YTD returns. And those that remained interested did not see a significant catalyst to add to their current holdings. See more here . But news of BlackRock filing for a spot bitcoin ETF created more confidence for the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs - reviving the demand for crypto and narrowing the discount of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ( GBTC ). Since then, investors and analysts have been closely watching the SEC. Ether futures filings in early August have added to that momentum. Will the SEC approve ether futures ETF filings? No one can say for sure whether the SEC will approve ether futures ETF filings. But there seems to be a reversal in the SEC’s stance. Back in May, the SEC told several issuers to withdraw their filings for ether futures ETFs. But since then, the SEC has changed course and said it is ready to publicly consider these products. This doesn’t necessarily guarantee that they will approve them, but I think it’s likely that they will. Still, with few guidelines regarding the SEC treatment of crypto, I wouldn’t be surprised if they still delayed approving ether futures ETFs. So far, we know that the SEC is more accepting of bitcoin futures vs. spot bitcoin. We also know that the SEC will distinguish a commodity from a security. Bitcoin, for example, has been classified as a commodity and is therefore under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). While the CFTC believes that ether is also a commodity, the SEC has been reluctant to call any cryptocurrency besides bitcoin a commodity. This classification issue could be a challenge in the approval of ether futures ETFs. But is there even demand for ether futures ETFs? Not all ETFs are meant to gather significant interest - some are meant to fill a space in the market. I think there is demand for ether-related ETF products. But with the fixation currently on spot crypto ETFs, I’m not sure there will be significant interest in more crypto futures products. I also don’t think that this demand will be nearly as big as the demand BITO saw when it was launched. It was the second-most heavily traded ETF at its launch date. Additionally, the general appetite for crypto has still been poor. Even though crypto equity ETFs are currently the highest-performing equity ETFs YTD and investors talk about them often, there are very few investors actually investing in these. I think ether futures ETFs filings haven’t necessarily created more excitement for ether futures ETFs. Instead, it created more excitement for the possibility of spot bitcoin ETF approvals. What does this mean for spot bitcoin ETFs? I don’t think the approval of ether futures ETFs will be a direct pathway for spot bitcoin ETF approvals. By that, I mean that the relationship - if ether futures ETFs are approved, then spot bitcoin ETF will be approved - isn’t necessarily true. The comparison is more like a rolling snowball of progressive events that will eventually lead to spot bitcoin ETF approval. Look back at the recent timeline of crypto ETF launches. Blockchain equity ETFs launched in January 2018. But it wasn’t until May 2021 that the first ETF with crypto in its name launched. Then, the first bitcoin futures ETF launched in October 2021 and the first inverse bitcoin futures ETF launched in June 2022. After a brief dry spell with some ETF closures, the first leveraged bitcoin futures ETF launched in June 2023. Now we potentially see filings for ether futures ETFs and a combined ether futures and bitcoin futures ETF. I believe these will come next, and at that point, it would be difficult to think of more excuses to not approve spot bitcoin ETFs. Bottom Line The SEC’s path for approval is still unclear. But the flurry of ether futures filings at the heels of the recent group of spot bitcoin filings proves that institutions still have significant interest in the crypto space. And they do not want to be left behind. Disclosure: © VettaFi LLC 2023. All rights reserved.

Embezzlement Allegations Jinwook Shin was taken into custody by South Korean authorities on August 7th after an investigation uncovered that the CEO had been allegedly embezzling investments and deposits belonging to the exchange's users during the time period between January 2019 and May 2021. According to the initial report, Shin allegedly engaged in fraudulent activities that manipulated cryptocurrency prices and trading volume on Bitsonic, which led to the misappropriation of approximately $7.5 million (10 billion won) from user funds. Liquidity Issues Leads To Shutdown Despite facing liquidity problems and suspension of withdrawals on the crypto platform, Shin continued to provide cryptocurrencies to new customers. This persistence drew the attention of the Seoul cyber crime department, which alleged that Shin failed to purchase cryptocurrencies during this period, raising suspicions about the legitimacy of the exchange's operations. In August 2021, the platform finally announced the closure of its operations, attributing the decision to ""internal and external issues."" This announcement was followed by the shutdown of 11 domestic cryptocurrency platforms by South Korean authorities, who were investigating alleged fraudulent activities. Vice President Also Complicit The investigation further implicated the vice president of Bitsonic, who is believed to have played a role in devising a scheme to acquire the cryptocurrencies held by the CEO within the exchange system. The VP, who is referred to as Mr. A, was allegedly working hand-in-hand with Shin to buy the cryptocurrency held by the latter on the exchange platform. A shell company established in Singapore was allegedly used in the process of manipulation. Government's Stance Against Fraud And Cybercrime South Korean authorities have recently taken a tough stance against fraudulent activities within the digital asset industry. Last month, the Korea Securities Depository partnered with Code, a firm specializing in Travel Rules, to address the rise in unlawful activities within the virtual asset market. This partnership aims to promote the issuance and utilization of Legal Entity Identifiers (LEI) to enhance investor protection. Additionally, the government has also been working on a crypto-tracking system, including an interagency investigation team, to counter cybercrime as a part of its commitment to ensuring the security and legitimacy of the cryptocurrency market. As the investigation into the alleged embezzlement unfolds, South Korea's proactive approach against fraudulent activities in the cryptocurrency sector continues to underscore the nation's commitment to fostering a secure and trustworthy digital asset environment.

15905415,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546820,1691751946,Cardano (ADA) Tests Psychological Support – What’s The Next Move?,"Cardano (ADA) recently made waves as it brushed against the critical $0.30 resistance level. The significance of such resistance levels in the world of cryptocurrencies cannot be underestimated, as they often mark crucial junctures in the price trajectory of digital assets. Resistance levels serve as key markers on the price charts, indicating levels at which an asset faces heightened selling pressure. These levels are points where a substantial number of traders historically have chosen to sell their holdings, causing the price to temporarily stall or reverse its upward trajectory. Such zones are closely monitored by market participants and analysts alike, as they offer insights into the sentiments and actions of traders. A successful breach of a resistance level often signifies a potential continuation of the upward trend, while a failure to overcome this obstacle may lead to a period of consolidation or even a reversal. Cardano Recent Performance And Market Landscape As of the latest data from CoinGecko, Cardano (ADA) stands at a price of approximately $0.300341, reflecting a 1.5% decline over the past 24 hours. However, the past seven days have seen a modest 0.9% surge, indicating a relatively stable performance. Related Reading: Turbulent AVAX Price Trends And Fading Trading Activity – What To Expect Notably, ADA’s recent touch of the $0.30 resistance level has sparked interest among traders and investors, highlighting the psychological significance of this price point. People believe in the long-term potential of #Cardano. According to Morning Consult, people sold $ADA (and Solana) the least often over the past month. Only 22% of holders. $BTC was sold by 46% and $ETH by 33% of holders. pic.twitter.com/UVGDrEasJ0 — Cardanians | stake with CRDN3 (@Cardanians_io) August 11, 2023 Interestingly, ADA’s current reversal mode should not be seen as an unequivocal bearish signal. The broader crypto market is exhibiting signs of recovery, with several major cryptocurrencies showing renewed potential. Moreover, the absence of intense selling pressure suggests that the recent resistance encounter might not translate into an extended downturn. Sideways Trading In The Near Future Despite the intriguing movement around the $0.30 resistance level, it is plausible that ADA might engage in ongoing sideways trading within the wide range of $0.29 to $0.31, according to a recent price analysis. This is a typical pattern observed in the cryptocurrency market, especially during periods of uncertainty. Such a scenario could persist until the end of the month, with traders cautiously navigating the price fluctuations. Cardano market cap currently at $10.3 billion. Chart: TradingView.com Cardano’s journey to the $0.30 resistance level is a captivating development in the crypto world. While ADA currently grapples with a reversal mode, the overall market sentiment leans towards recovery. Related Reading: XRP Price: Breaking This Key Resistance Could Propel Crypto To $21 By 2025 – Analyst Understanding the dynamics of resistance levels and their implications is crucial for traders aiming to decipher ADA’s future price action. As the month unfolds, all eyes will remain on ADA and the wider crypto market to discern whether the sideways trading will give way to a more definitive trend.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar.  “Investors may have been fine holding non-yield bearing stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-terms rates above 5%,” the analysts wrote.  Read more: Congresswoman Maxine Waters Says She’s ‘Deeply Concerned’ About PayPal’s New Stablecoin  The payments giant earlier this week said that it was entering the crypto market with its own dollar-pegged stablecoin, PayPal USD, in a first for a major financial company. The Ethereum-based token will be available first on PayPal and then on Venmo, and can be exchanged for dollars at any time.  Investors are likely indifferent to which stablecoins they hold as long as they are perceived as “safe and accessible on the largest trading platforms,” the report said.  Bank of America says it doesn’t expect PYUSD’s launch to lead to “accelerated regulatory clarity” because the stablecoin’s issuance “does not alter systemic risk for traditional markets,” but it could face regulatory hurdles if nonbanks are ultimately banned from issuing stablecoins.  PYUSD will likely target a market that has remained largely untapped until now, including “blockchain technology-enabled asset transfers, payments and remittances,” the report added.

This latest regulatory pronouncement might well have been inspired after seeing PayPal roll out its PYUSD stablecoin which seeks to become a bridge between fiat and Web3 for merchants and consumers alike. This particular innovation for the dollar and crypto may have been seen as a step too far by US financial authorities, given the size of PayPal and its huge financial clout and influence.

It’s not just the Fed that is acting in such a manner either. The FDIC and the OCC, both very weighty financial agencies, have also put rules into place that crypto companies, and the businesses looking to interact with them, are likely to find burdensome and difficult to comply with. Opinion The financial agencies should act to give adequate protections to businesses and consumers from the issues that can arise from such groundbreaking financial innovations in the crypto sector, but instead they are acting as kingmakers in order to favour the banking industry from which they come. Crypto came into being as a creative and innovative industry that favours speed, security and privacy, and puts the consumer first. However, cumbersome and pro-bank regulations are pulling crypto companies down to the same level as their lumbering banking competitors.

A potential completion of the pattern would mark the beginning of alt season, according to one trader.  A bullish inverse head-and-shoulders price pattern is building in the combined market capitalization of altcoins. The term “altcoin” is short for “alternative coin” and refers to cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin (BTC).  A potential completion of the pattern would signal ""alt season,"" or outperformance of alternative cryptocurrencies relative to bitcoin and ether (ETH), according to technical analysis by Josh Olszewicz, a crypto trader and former researcher at Valkyrie Investments. Olszewicz analyzed the charts of altcoins, excluding ether and prominent stablecoins.  The inverse head-and-shoulders, one of the most trusted bullish technical analysis patterns in the market, forms when an asset chalks out three price troughs, with the middle one being the lowest. A breakout or a bearish-to-bullish trend change is confirmed once prices rise above the trendline (neckline), connecting the peaks between the lows.  Chartered market technicians ascertain the post-breakout price target by adding the depth of the pattern (distance between the low of the head and the neckline) to the breakout point.  If you have a look at the altcoin's daily market cap chart, the bottom of the left shoulder, $188.4 billion, was created in June 2022; the low of the head, $173.23 billion, was made at the end of December; and the bottom of the right shoulder at $177.36 billion appeared in June this year, data from TradingView shows.  The bounce from the right shoulder low has stalled in the past three weeks, with the market cap consolidating at around $230 billion at press time. The pattern will be complete once the market cap rises past the neckline resistance located near $300 billion.  ""The altcoin market cap is showing some sort of triple bottom/inverted head-and-shoulders situation,"" Olszewicz said in a market update.  ""I don't buy the head-and-shoulders pattern that's sitting in the middle of consolidation. I am waiting for a break above $300 billion,"" Olszewicz added.  The chart shows two scenarios: one where the altcoin market cap turns lower from here, invalidating a potential inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.  The other scenario involves the altcoin market cap rising past $300 billion, signaling an onset of alt season.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,ALTCOIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/11/altcoin-season-is-coming-technical-analysis-suggests,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3cebfad353ffe223c7f63d3f8d65d0afb06fea51-1358x764.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15903590,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546842,1691748042,"Bittrex, SEC Reach Settlement In Securities Violation Case","Another crypto firm, Bittrex, bites the dust in the SEC’s continued clampdown on major players in the crypto industry amidst regulatory uncertainty. The regulator has been known to come hard at these crypto firms because it believes they aren’t toeing an almost non-existent regulatory framework. Bittrex Succumbs To SEC In a press release dated August 10, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that crypto exchange Bittrex and its former CEO William Shihara have agreed to a $24 million monetary settlement with the regulator. According to the statement, Bittrex’s international affiliate company Bittrex Global GmbH also agreed to settle the charge of failing to register as a national securities exchange. Related Reading: New Milestone For Ethereum Could Spell Good News For ETH Price The SEC had alleged that the crypto exchange and its former CEO operated an “unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.” It argued that the exchange violated securities laws when it offered and allowed US investors to invest in crypto assets, which it deems as securities (The SEC has continued to allege that tokens like MATIC, SOL, ADA, and XRP are securities). Furthermore, the agency accused the firm and its former CEO of going as far as to cover their tracks in order to escape regulatory scrutiny. The SEC’s complaint stated Shihara directed token issuers, who wanted their tokens listed on the exchange, to remove “problematic statements,” which could lead any regulator to investigate whether or not the company offered and sold securities on the platform. The settlement news may come as a surprise considering many thought the SEC was going to experience a pushback from the crypto exchange. This is because Bittrex had earlier argued that the SEC had no authority to regulate tokens traded on its platform due to a lack of clear-cut law by Congress authorizing the regulator to do so. SEC Might Be Killing The Crypto Economy Besides Bittrex, the SEC is currently embroiled in legal battles against the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance and Coinbase. Similarly, it accuses these exchanges of offering and selling securities on their platform without registering with the agency. While many may argue that the SEC is simply doing its job of protecting the interests of US investors, others may take a different point of view by arguing that the SEC is simply killing the Web3 economy in the country. For instance, Bittrex, before filing bankruptcy in the US, had earlier shut down its US operations due to “continued regulatory uncertainty.” Related Reading: The Spoils Of Victory: XRP Daily Transactions Surpass Ethereum This unfavorable regulatory environment is undoubtedly one of the reasons why some other crypto firms have also chosen to take their operations abroad instead of being domiciled in the US, especially with the fact that other countries are putting crypto-friendly guidelines in place on how crypto exchanges should conduct their operations. For this reason, Congress needs to step in and pass clear-cut laws that stipulate whether or not crypto exchanges fall under the purview of the SEC, and if yes, it needs to also address whether crypto assets are securities or not.

Details Of The Proposals The move by the Aave community comes as it attempts to limit the risk posed to the protocol by the large borrowing position held by Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance. On-chain risk management platform Chaos Lab put forward the proposals. According to the platform, volatility in Curve markets had considerably increased after the recent exploit suffered by Curve. The CRV token is the native token of the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Curve Finance. Curve founder Egorov had used as much as 30% of CRV’s total market capitalization to take out nearly $60 million in loans on Aave. However, the Curve Finance hack significantly impacted the price of CRV, sending it plummeting. This made Egorov’s position vulnerable, potentially exposing Aave to a liquidation risk. The voting on the proposals is set to continue until the 12th of August. The first proposal seeks to reduce the liquidation threshold by 6% for CRV on Aave v2. This could lead to user accounts becoming subject to liquidation upon approval. The second proposal disables borrowing of CRV tokens on Polygon v3 and Ethereum. This would make it impossible to short CRV through the Aave protocol. The two proposals to limit Aave’s exposure have found overwhelming support in the community. So far, over 571,000 votes have been cast, with 100% of the votes in favor of limiting Aave’s exposure to CRV. The Third Proposal With fears surrounding Egorov’s loans, Aave’s community is also voting on a third proposal, voting for which ends on the 11th of August. The proposal, put forward by Aave Chan founder Marc Zeller, calls on the Aave treasury to purchase $2 million worth of CRV tokens from Curve Finance. Zeller’s reasoning for such a move is that it would signal that major DeFi players support Curve and the health of the larger DeFi ecosystem. However, this proposal has not gained as much support in the community, although a majority do support it. Currently, around 62% of votes favor the proposal, while 37% have voted against it. The Curve Finance Exploit Curve Finance suffered a major exploit at the beginning of the month, with hackers managing to siphon off millions worth of crypto. As a result of the hack, the protocol’s CRV token saw a significant price drop, casting a long shadow on the DeFi ecosystem. The decline in CRV’s value also put a $168 million lending position taken by Curve founder Michael Egorov at risk. If this position was liquidated, it could have disastrous consequences for the larger DeFi ecosystem, putting major protocols at risk. Following the exploit, crypto exchanges moved to suspend withdrawals, with Upbit among the first to act, suspending deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token. “Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.” However, Curve and Egorov found support from prominent players in the crypto space. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Jeffrey Huang, and Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV from Egorov, resulting in the principal value of Egorov’s loans dropping to $54 million. Justin Sun posted a message in support of Curve, stating, “Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed.

Two out of the three proposals in question opened for voting on the 10th of August. Details Of The Proposals The move by the Aave community comes as it attempts to limit the risk posed to the protocol by the large borrowing position held by Michael Egorov, the founder of Curve Finance.

Two dominant theories are currently at the forefront: the 4-Year Cycle and the Elliot Impulse Wave. However, a comprehensive analysis by the esteemed crypto analyst CryptoCon, suggests a fascinating intersection of these two theories. The Dueling Bitcoin Price Prediction Theories At the heart of the debate are two camps. The first, the 4-Year Cycle proponents, believe in Bitcoin’s 4-year journey from cycle tops to bottoms, with a predicted zenith in 2025. The second camp, the Elliot Impulse Wave advocates, are forecasting a powerful parabolic top either this year or by early 2024. CryptoCon’s meticulous analysis, which encompasses TA, on-chain data, market psychology, and more, offers a fresh perspective. “I believe it may be possible to see the best of both worlds for each group of thinkers,” he posited. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bears Ran Out Of Coins? What This Analyst Forecast For BTC At Around $30,000 A significant portion of the 4-Year Cycle theory hinges on the halving’s impact on Bitcoin’s price. “When the Bitcoin supply is reduced approximately every 4 years, this should trigger a supply decrease which causes price to rise,” CryptoCon elucidated. However, he also raised a counterpoint, noting the diminishing influence of miner supply output on Bitcoin’s price, especially given its current market size. Historical Parallels, Signals And Indicators CryptoCon drew attention to the 2011-2013 cycle, a period that didn’t adhere to traditional patterns. This cycle experienced both an early and a later top. Could this be a precedent for the current cycle? “Both of these groups of people seem to forget one particular cycle that seemingly defied all of the rules. 2011 – 2013,” he recalled. Two compelling signals were central to his analysis: the DXY Correlation Coefficient and the Vigor Signal. Historically, these have been precursors to a price parabola. “The parabola signal has triggered. This has been the start of every price parabola by definition,” he emphasized, underscoring their reliability. Historically, when Bitcoin has shown a low correlation with the US dollar, significant price movements have been observed. Related Reading: Bitcoin Futures Fakeout: The Price Divergence That Predicts A Phony The November 28th Cycles Theory, rooted in the date of Bitcoin’s first halving, has also been a consistent predictor of Bitcoin’s price movements for a decade. It segments the Bitcoin price journey into four distinct phases: Green, Blue, Red, and Orange years (see chart below), each with its own characteristic price behavior. “With its level of accuracy, there’s no reason to expect it to fail this cycle. Telling us the true cycle top will come late 2025,” CryptoCon confidently stated. CryptoCon’s Trend Pattern Price Model, which uses patterns in angles degrees from cycle highs and lows to predict future ones, projects a price of $130,000 by the end of the November 28th Cycle’s Theory timeframe. He was quick to caution against over-reliance on fundamentals, stating, “Although many would say there is no limit to price with fundamentals, I think this is an absolutely ridiculous argument.” Converging BTC Predictions Synthesizing all this data, CryptoCon envisions a scenario where both the 4-Year Cycle and the Elliot Impulse Wave theories might harmoniously coexist. He anticipates an early top around April 2024, potentially reaching $90,000, followed by a mid-cycle bear market. The final top, he predicts, could touch $130k by late 2025. CryptoCon’s analysis, while detailed and comprehensive, also comes with a dose of humility. “This is what I believe is possible. Absolute? Hardly,” he remarked. As the Bitcoin community continues its fervent discussions, one thing remains clear: Only time will truly reveal the course Bitcoin’s price will take. At press time, the BTC price stood at $29,466.

According to the proposal, the tokens will be released gradually, with the proposal outlining the distribution of two billion SPK tokens over the next ten years. The SPK Token Airdrop The proposal is aimed at promoting long-term engagement with the platform and outlines the eventual distribution of two billion SPK tokens over ten years in an effort to incentivize the continued usage of the Spark Protocol. The SPK token will also act as a governance token for SparkDAO. “The goal of the SPK pre-farming airdrop is to give users and borrow-arbers a reason to keep using Spark Protocol if the EDSR proposal to increase stability fees to 5% goes through.” According to Rune, the proposal would be an avenue for the community to secure SPK tokens before the launch of the SubDAO, with Rune stating on X, “I posted an overview of the potential SparkDAO SPK pre-farming airdrop for early users of http://sparkprotocol.io borrowing: This would be a way to secure early SPK tokens before the SubDAOs launch (Farming not available to US and VPN users)” Spark Expected To Become SubDAO Spark Protocol is a lending protocol that has been introduced by MakerDAO. The protocol provides DeFi loans, sourcing liquidity directly from Maker. As collateral, the protocol accepts several assets, such as DAI, ETH, and Staked ETH. Spark Protocol eventually aims to become a SubDAO, which marks a significant step in Maker’s Endgame Plan. As a subDAO, Spark will be an entirely independent, decentralized autonomous organization within MakerDAO. The Endgame plan envisions the creation of several subDAOs similar to Spark, each governed by its own distinct community and token. A Way To Incentivize Usage The SubDAO tokens will be allocated to Spark borrowers and will utilize several assets as collateral, distributed proportionately towards the amount and duration of borrowing. According to Christensen, the aim is to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants whose goals are aligned with SparkDAO. “We want to bootstrap a community of users and DAO participants that are aligned with the mission and potential of SparkDAO.” The eventual goal is to incentivize the Spark token’s active usage, despite it offering a 5% yield on DAI deposits, also called Enhanced DAI Savings Rate. The EDSR on Spark climbed to 8% earlier in the week, resulting in a significant inflow of capital as users rushed to leverage borrowing arbitrage opportunities. This saw users borrow DAI at lower rates and then deploy it for higher yields in EDSR. Maker’s new Spark Protocol has courted controversy following its launch after it emerged that the protocol’s terms of service actively prevented users from accessing the platform through virtual private networks (VPNs). By limiting VPN access, MakerDAO appeared to be restricting US-based users from accessing the platform. Maker’s Endgame Plan MakerDAO’s Endgame is a significant update planned to enhance the protocol’s efficiency, resilience, and participation. It aims to do this by creating a strong governance equilibrium that would act as the bedrock for SubDAOs, helping parallelize growth and innovation in a community-driven ecosystem. In the short term, Endgame hopes to enhance the supply of DAI to over 100 billion within three years. It also aims to ensure that the Maker ecosystem is anchored in a vibrant and independent DAO economy that could grow at an accelerating rate. At the same time, it would also maintain governance equilibrium, ensuring it could scale to any size. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

42409961,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcR76b,1691739727,Shiba Inu Bucks Bitcoin Snoozefest Ahead of Shibarium Deployment,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens have been among the top-performing cryptocurrencies over the past week amid low volatility conditions for bitcoin (BTC).  The tokens have risen 20% over the past week, compared with nominal gains for bitcoin and ether (ETH). Among alternative currencies, higher returns were generated only by rollbit (RLB) and unibot (UNIBOT).  Trading volumes hit $315 million over a 24-hour period on Thursday, their highest point since February. Crypto analytics firm Kaiko pointed to increased developer activity on Shiba Inu earlier this week, which suggests that the price gains weren't without cause.  Traders of the meme coin, which is vying to be a decentralized-finance powerhouse, are likely buying tokens ahead of the expected launch of Shibarium, a Shiba Inu-based blockchain, later this month. Some of the recent bullish sentiment came as developers said last week they would tie digital identity verification to all Shiba Inu developments in the future, including on Shibarium.  Dubbed self-sovereign identity, or SSI, the IDs are the digital alter ego of identity documents, like passports and driver’s licenses. In the digital world, SSI is said to give users more control over their personal data and its distribution online.  The developers said the rising interest in digital identities and data protection in Canada and the European Union could help position Shiba Inu as a more serious — and compliant — project compared with other blockchains.  Some say such developments could ultimately make the case for shib tokens as a long-term holding among serious investors.  ""Shiba Inu is one of the very few meme coins that has a thriving community but lacked the backing of serious long-term crypto believers due to its inherent nature lacking any valid use case. But the launch of Shibarium is definitely a positive and bold step in the right direction,"" Khaleelulla Baig, co-founder of crypto exchange KoinBasket, wrote in a Telegram message.  ""If they can pull this off well, I see this trend spreading across to other meme coins with strong communities and network effects,"" Baig added.  Shiba Inu developers have previously said Shibarium would have a focus on metaverse and gaming applications, especially as the non-fungible-token sector is expected to heat up in the coming years. A test blockchain for Shibarium has seen meaningful activity in the past months with 27 million transactions from an estimated 16 million wallets as of July, indicating brisk demand for the network.",POSITIVE,BTC | SHIB,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/11/shiba-inu-bucks-crypto-market-lull-ahead-of-shibarium-deployment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a2213121181cdbfd88ecfadb16300585e6b29f57-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The coin’s journey has been fraught with challenges as market sentiment takes a bearish stance, casting shadows over its potential upward trajectory. The recent attempt at a bullish surge, stemming from the $11 support level, encountered a formidable obstacle at the $15.8 resistance level. This pivotal juncture proved to be an insurmountable barrier, leading to an abrupt price rejection. The consequence of this rejection has been instrumental in preserving AVAX’s bearish market structure, leaving traders and investors grappling with uncertainty. AVAX Long/Short Ratio Signals Predominance Of Sellers On closer examination of the trading landscape, the long/short ratio in the four-hour timeframe reveals a striking imbalance in favor of sellers. Data sourced from Coinglass paints a telling picture, with a staggering 56.5% of open contracts adopting short positions. Source: Coinglass This lopsided ratio serves as a clear indication that a significant cohort of market participants anticipates AVAX’s downward trajectory to persist, amplifying the prevailing bearish sentiment. The culmination of these factors has translated into AVAX’s current price of $12.46, as reported by CoinGecko. Over the past 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has experienced a modest decline of 0.6%, reflective of the prevailing market volatility. AVAX price today.

Prices shot up to those levels for a few minutes at 20:30 UTC on Thursday before immediately reverting to parity with the spot markets on other exchanges.  The bump, which took a few seconds to correct, was likely a result of low liquidity in the hours following a token relisting on Gemini, during which a buyer may have placed an outsized market order — which was filled at an outrageously high price.  As such, XRP traded at levels higher than the broader market for at least a few hours, price chat data shows.  Some market observers opined a seller placed a spoof order at $50 per XRP, which was unintendedly filled by a buyer who may have “fat-fingered” the trade.  Market depth data shows XRP liquidity on Gemini remains relatively low, with only a $37,000 order required to move prices by 2% on the exchange. In contrast, the same price move on Binance would require at least $2.2 million.  The token was relisted on Gemini after July’s court order in favor of Ripple Labs, with a federal judge ruling that the “offer and sale of XRP on digital asset exchanges did not amount to offers and sales of investment contracts.” In 2020, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple Labs on allegations that Ripple sold XRP to U.S. customers without adequate registration.

Readings above 90% signal greed or excess optimism, and readings below 10% represent extreme fear or pessimism. Such indicators are widely tracked because excess optimism or greed is often seen at market tops while fear is seen at market bottoms.  Data shows Matrixport's index recently turned higher from 30% to 60%, bottoming out after July's slide from above 90%.  ""The index appears to have bottomed out as the daily signal (grey) is projecting upside pressure. After four weeks of consolidation, this indicator is tactically bullish and bitcoin prices could resume the uptrend,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at Matrixport, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.  Notice how tops and bottoms in the index and the index's 21-day simple moving average, or SMA, have historically coincided with bullish and bearish reversals in bitcoin's price. The 21-day SMA now shows signs of bottoming out, supporting the case for a renewed upside volatility in bitcoin.  Bitcoin has been listless for some time now, trading between $28,000 and $30,000 for over two weeks, amid volatility in traditional markets and expectations for interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve early next year.  According to some analysts, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's pending decision on whether to approve a spot exchange-traded fund is a crucial catalyst for price volatility.

The announcement, made on Thursday, comes within two months of Bittrex's bankruptcy filing and follows the trend of regulatory scrutiny facing cryptocurrency exchanges. Bittrex's Position and SEC's Allegations Bittrex, which filed for bankruptcy in May, was sued by the SEC earlier this year. The regulator's charges revolved around the simultaneous operation of the company as a securities exchange, broker, and clearinghouse without appropriate registration, allegations that have also been leveledd at Coinbase and Binance.US. According to the settlement agreement, Bittrex neither admits nor denies the allegations. The terms also stipulate that Bittrex will have 90 days after its liquidation plan is effective to pay the SEC, and any delays may prompt the regulator to seek court judgment. SEC Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the following in an official statement: ""Today’s settlement makes clear that you cannot escape liability by simply changing labels or altering descriptions, because what matters is the economic realities of those offerings [as such]."" Context and Details of the Settlement The case against Bittrex is rooted in its alleged role as an unregistered broker, exchange, and clearing agency in providing services to U.S. investors in connection with crypto assets. Part of the charges includes an accusation that Bittrex worked closely with token issuers to edit online statements to circumvent federal securities laws. The settlement, subject to court approval, includes financial components: disgorgement of $14.4 million, prejudgment interest of $4 million, and a civil penalty of $5.6 million, culminating in a total monetary payment of $24 million. Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, noted in his remarks that: “[For years], Bittrex worked with token issuers to 'scrub' their online statements of any indicia that they were investment contracts—all in an effort to evade the federal securities laws. They failed.” The settlement underscores the broader regulatory landscape and the SEC's vigilant stance against non-compliance in the crypto industry.

ETH could spike toward $1,820 before the bulls attempt a fresh increase. Ethereum is moving lower from the $1,875 and $1,880 resistance levels. The price is trading below $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a bullish flag pattern forming with resistance near $1,855 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could drop toward the $1,820 support where the bulls might take a stand. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum’s price struggled to clear the $1,880 resistance zone and started a downside correction. ETH slowly moved lower below the $1,850 pivot level, similar to Bitcoin. There was a drop below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,800 swing low to the $1,876 high. The bears even pushed the price below the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. Besides, there is a bullish flag pattern forming with resistance near $1,855 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ether is now trading below $1,850 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The next key resistance is near the $1,880 level. A close above the $1,880 level could increase the chances of a steady increase toward $1,920. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2,000 hurdle, above which the price could rise toward the $2,040 level or even $2,120. Downside Break in ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,855 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,840 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $1,800 swing low to the $1,876 high. The first major support is near the $1,830 zone or the channel lower trend line. If the bulls fail to protect the $1,820 support, there could be a sharp decline. The next major support is near the $1,800 support level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,720 level in the near term.

15893574,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546756,1691726443,Circle Strategic Defense: $1 Billion War Chest Shields Against Shrinking Market Share,"According to a Bloomberg report, Circle, a prominent player in the stablecoin market, strategically leverages its substantial cash reserves of over $1 billion to weather fresh competition from non-crypto giants like PayPal. The company’s market share of the second-largest stablecoin, USD Coin (USDC), has been declining, mainly due to factors such as Binance’s decision to reduce its usage of USDC. However, per the report, Circle remains optimistic about the future of stablecoins and aims to stem the decline while exploring new revenue streams and global expansion. Circle Relies On $1 Billion Cash Cushion The circulation of Circle’s USDC has witnessed a significant drop from $45 billion to approximately $26 billion this year, while Tether, the leading stablecoin, has experienced growth during the same period. Related Reading: Whale Purchases $10 Million stETH In The past Day, Here Are Possible Reasons Why Circle attributes part of this decline to Binance’s reduced utilization of USDC to promote its native token. Increasing competition from non-crypto companies like PayPal further intensifies the challenges for Circle. The company’s over $1 billion cash cushion provides a significant hedge against market headwinds. The company generates revenue primarily from interest income on assets backing the USDC, including dollar deposits and short-term Treasuries. According to Bloomberg, Circle’s strong financial performance is “evident,” with revenues exceeding $779 million in the year’s first half. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached $219 million in the same period, exceeding the 2022 full-year figure of $150 million. Circle’s CEO Remains Bullish On Stablecoins While acknowledging the impact of “tail-risk events” on USDC adoption, Circle’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, remains optimistic about stablecoins’ mainstream potential. Allaire believes that increasing competition, such as PayPal’s recent entry into the market, will drive more financial services and internet payment firms to embrace stablecoins. Circle is actively pursuing partnerships to promote the broader adoption of USDC and plans to enhance transparency by regularly sharing financial reports. Moreover, the company has engaged Deloitte as its auditor. Allaire anticipates that stablecoin issuers will face greater scrutiny and regulatory standards in the coming years. With regulators tightening control over stablecoins globally, he predicts that entities unable to meet these standards will be crowded out of the mainstream market. Related Reading: PEPE Coin Makes Minor Gains With 3.5% Spike – Sign Of Recovery? Nevertheless, Circle remains confident in its ability to adapt and benefit from the evolving regulatory environment. Despite potential interest rate declines, Circle expects increased crypto activity, positioning the company for further growth. Circle is leveraging its substantial cash reserves to navigate market challenges and competition from non-crypto players. Despite declining market share, Circle remains focused on expanding revenue streams, promoting wider adoption of USDC, and embracing transparent financial reporting. With the regulatory landscape evolving, Circle aims to meet the highest standards and thrive in the stablecoin market, positioning itself for long-term success. Conversely, USDC currently boasts a market capitalization of approximately $26.17 billion, securing its place as the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap data. This figure represents a minute 0.37% of the total cryptocurrency market, indicating the stablecoin’s steady performance despite the highly dynamic nature of the crypto space. With a circulating supply of 26.17 billion USDC tokens, the stablecoin has established a robust presence in the market. Furthermore, USDC’s trading volume has surged, reaching an impressive $3.03 billion in the past 24 hours. This substantial trading activity positions USDC as the fourth most actively traded cryptocurrency, evidencing its liquidity and attractiveness to market participants. The 24-hour trading volume to market cap ratio stands at 11.59%, reflecting the strong liquidity and market depth of USDC, which further contributes to its stability and utility.

15893057,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546784,1691725332,Bitcoin Price Next Leg Lower Underway And At Risk for Key Reasons,"Bitcoin price is moving lower from the $30,200 zone. BTC is signaling a fresh decline and there is a risk of a drop toward the $28,500 support. Bitcoin is struggling to remain in a positive zone above $29,200. The price is trading below $29,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $29,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it breaks the $29,200 support zone. Bitcoin Price Trims Gains Bitcoin price faced another rejection above the $30,000 resistance zone. A high was formed near $30,190 and BTC reacted to the downside. There was a move below the $30,000 and $29,800 levels. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $28,628 swing low to the $30,190 high. It seems like the bulls are now putting up some fight near the $29,300 zone. Bitcoin is now trading below $29,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $29,450 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If there is a fresh increase, the pair could face resistance near the 100 hourly Simple moving average at $29,400. Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com The next major resistance is near the trend line and $29,500. A close above the trend line could start a decent increase toward $30,000. To spark a steady uptrend, the price must settle above the $30,000 resistance. In the stated case, the price could rise toward $31,200 or even $32,000 in the coming days. More Losses In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to clear the $29,500 resistance, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $29,320 level. The next major support is near the $29,220 level or the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the key increase from the $28,628 swing low to the $30,190 high. A downside break below the $29,220 level might spark bearish moves. In the stated case, the price could revisit $29,000. Any more losses might call for a move toward the $28,500 level in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $29,220, followed by $29,000.

The Ethereum-based CRV token is the backbone of the Curve ecosystem, which has established itself as the largest stable swap and second-largest decentralized exchange (DEX). Related Reading: Rising Star Hedera (HBAR) And Its 11% Climb – A Closer Look Curve and Binance’s BNB Chain Forge Strategic Alliance As part of the partnership, Curve will explore the deployment of its protocol on the BNB Chain, the thriving ecosystem powered by its native token, BNB. This strategic alignment aims to leverage the strengths of both platforms, further fueling the growth of DeFi on the BNB Chain. Yi He, Co-Founder of Binance and Head of Binance Labs, expressed enthusiasm about the collaboration, stating: Curve is the largest stableswap, and as a key protocol in DeFi, it has contributed to the steady growth of the space in 2023. Given the recent events that have impacted the protocol, Binance Labs has offered our full support to Curve through our investment and strategic collaboration. We view this cooperation as a starting point and look forward to working together to further propel the growth of the DeFi ecosystem. Curve Founder, Michael Egorov, acknowledged the significance of the collaboration, stating: BNB Chain has earned a significant presence in DeFi and is well-positioned to deploy Curve’s current and future products on its chain. We look forward to collaboratively fostering innovation and growth across the DeFi ecosystem. According to Binance Labs’ announcement, Curve’s Automated Market Maker (AMM) platform has revolutionized liquidity provision in DeFi, offering hundreds of incentivized liquidity pools with low slippage and transaction fees. With the support and strategic investment of Binance Labs, the protocol seems poised to accelerate its mission to transform DeFi by increasing liquidity, reducing transaction friction, and expanding its ecosystem. Is Cross-Chain Interoperability The Key To Curve’s Success On BNB Chain? Deploying Curve to BNB Chain brings numerous advantages to both Curve and the BNB Chain ecosystem. One key benefit is enhanced scalability, as BNB Chain offers high throughput and low latency, providing a robust infrastructure for DeFi protocols like Curve. By deploying on BNB Chain, Curve can leverage the network’s capabilities to handle more transactions and accommodate the growing user demand. Another advantage is the lower transaction fees offered by BNB Chain. This cost-efficiency appeals to users seeking to minimize expenses when interacting with Curve. By deploying on BNB Chain, Curve users can enjoy reduced transaction fees, enhancing the overall affordability of using the Curve protocol. The cross-chain interoperability of BNB Chain also enables seamless integration of assets and protocols from different blockchains, creating opportunities for Curve to collaborate with other projects and protocols within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Related Reading: Aptos (APT) Volume Remains Extremely High, More Gains Ahead? Deploying Curve to BNB Chain can expose the protocol to the extensive Binance ecosystem. Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, operates its ecosystem on BNB Chain. This exposure opens doors to potential partnerships, collaborations, and increased visibility among Binance users, further strengthening Curve’s position in the market. Overall, deploying the platform to BNB Chain aligns with its goal of expanding its presence across multiple chains and reaching a broader user base. By leveraging the advantages of BNB Chain, such as enhanced scalability, lower transaction fees, access to a large user base, cross-chain interoperability, and exposure to the Binance ecosystem, the protocol can contribute to the growth and development of the DeFi ecosystem.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin and ether are opening flat in Asia trading, seemingly unaffected by Thursday's Consumer Price Index numbers.  Insights: Coinbase (COIN) recently likened cryptocurrencies to Beanie Babies, questioning their future in finance. Meanwhile, analysts project that real-world asset tokenization could become a $5 trillion industry, but warn that without specific changes, tokenization won't significantly evolve finance.

Bitcoin was down 0.4% to $29,451, while ether was 0.1% lower at $1,851, during early Asian trading hours.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is down 0.39%.  Crypto seems to be unaffected by the latest Consumer Price Index numbers, which showed a modest amount of inflation and which was in line with economists' predictions.  In July, both the CPI and core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.2% from June. On an annual basis, CPI rose 3.2%, and core CPI rose 4.7%. The relatively mild inflation numbers mean the Federal Reserve will be less likely to raise rates at its next policy meeting in September.  Aside from macroeconomic factors, analysts continue to wonder why bitcoin won't budge above $30,000. Possible reasons include the uncertainty over whether the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will approve a spot bitcoin ETF, miners taking profits ahead of the Bitcoin halving scheduled for next April, a dearth of new retail market participation and strong resistance in derivatives trading.  Even though many adrenaline-addicted crypto traders might be missing volatility, bitcoin is surely looking like a good store of value these days.

This Positive Correlation Data Points To A Potential 20% Jump For DOGE,"Dogecoin has been one of the cryptocurrencies to watch in the past few weeks. However, the token’s price appears to be slowing down after recording significant bullish momentum. Interestingly, there might be renewed optimism around the DOGE price, as a crypto analyst has offered insight on what to expect from the meme coin in the coming weeks. Related Reading: Dogecoin Falls While Others Rally, Is It Decoupling From The Market? Dogecoin To Experience A 20% Price Rally? On Thursday, August 10, crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared data from IntoTheBlock, suggesting that DOGE might witness a positive price movement soon. This suggestion is based on the similarities in the price history of both Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin. According to his post on X (formerly Twitter), there is a “strong” positive correlation of 0.74 between the two meme coins over the past two months. This indicates that when SHIB’s price shifts, the price of DOGE often moves in the same direction. Source: TradingView/ali_charts Interestingly, this hasn’t happened in the past few days, as the DOGE price has not taken significant action. The value of SHIB, on the other hand, has surged by 22% in the last seven days. However, Ali Martinez noted that “given their high correlation coefficient,” a bullish price movement might still be on the horizon for DOGE. So, investors might want to keep a keen eye on the token’s performance in the coming days. DOGE Price Stuck In A Range – Price Overview Dogecoin has struggled to maintain the momentum garnered from Elon Musk’s support a few weeks ago. The meme coin has been trading mainly within a range since then, recording a mere 3.1% gain in the past week. After reaching a 7-day high of $0.07658 on Saturday, August 5, the DOGE price shed all its gain to trade below $0.073. However, the token’s price is back up, hovering around its weekly high.

DOGE trades about 5.5% down from the significant $0.08 zone after failing to breach it on July 31. As of this writing, the Dogecoin price is $0.075739, having leaped by 0.3% in the last 24 hours. With a nearly $10.7 billion market cap, DOGE ranks as the 8th-largest cryptocurrency. CoinGecko data reveals that there has been a substantial boost in DOGE’s market activity, with a 17.6% increase in its daily trading volume. The cryptocurrency currently has a 24-hour trading volume of over $430.2 million.

15886786,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=546726,1691712039,"Bitcoin Bears Ran Out Of Coins? What This Analyst Forecast For BTC At Around $30,000","Despite today’s macroeconomic developments, the price of Bitcoin continues to move sideways and seems likely to stay on this path. The number one crypto by market cap has seen its volatility drop to fresh lows as its price is trapped at current levels. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Prints Bullish Technical Pattern, Why Close Above $1,880 Is Critical At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $26,600 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours. Over the past seven days, the cryptocurrency has recorded some profits but has been unable to break above or below the $28,000 to $30,500 range. A New Normal For Bitcoin? Volatility Likely To Decline Until This Changes Analyst Dylan LeClair pointed out that operators in the derivatives sector have dominated the current Bitcoin price action. In that sense, the BTC spot-to-derivative trading volume ratio followed volatility and declined to all-time lows. As seen in the chart below, this ratio shows that the spot market has been suppressed by the derivatives sector, with traders “chopping each other to oblivion.” LeClair stated the following: (…) spot bears have mostly run out of coins & spot bulls are either fully deployed or are sidelined TradFi waiting for ETF approval. With the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) out of session until September and low uncertainty in the short term, the price of Bitcoin seems poised to keep chopping around its current levels. In this environment, derivatives traders will likely profit from selling volatility via different financial instruments. Data from the derivatives platform Deribit shows an uptick in call (buy) contracts on the options sectors for October to December expiry. A report posted by this platform from Rogue Trader Academy highlights the need for a catalyst to push BTC out of its current range. The market is positioning itself for a Bitcoin spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approval in Q4, 2023, thus why players on the options markets are accumulating calls. Selling volatility has been a profitable strategy in July. Still, as the metric hovers around historical lows, traders become more resilient to dump their contracts on the derivatives sector, further suppressing BTC’s price. Rogue Trader Academy stated: (…) those selling volatility (gamma sellers) are growing hesitant to offload at such historically low implied vol levels, especially with significant economic data like the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) on the horizon for this week.

In this low volatility, low liquidity environment, only a catalyst will push BTC beyond $30,000 and beyond $40,000 by the end of the year. Something seems apparent in this context: Bitcoin seems ahead of any bullish narrative and likely to outperform in the sector for the remainder of 2023.
