42430241,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpuNh,1551813638,MakerDAO Opens Token Holder Vote on Fee Hike for Ethereum Stablecoin,"The open-source developer group behind the dollar-pegged, ethereum-backed stablecoin DAI is considering whether higher fees could help stave off mounting liquidity issues.  During the weekly developer call on Feb. 28, some token holders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, voiced concerns about whether the peg, the mechanism by which the cryptocurrency holds a stable value, can continue under the present design constraints.  Christensen said last Thursday that the DAI’s dollar-peg is “almost at a breaking point” as a lack of organic demand threatens to start a “dangerous feedback loop” driven by “a speculative drop in the price.” He then called for a community poll to guide stakeholder votes about increasing fees and raising the stablecoin system’s debt ceiling.  Launched Monday, people who hold MKR governance tokens are now able to vote on whether to raise the “ Dai Stability Feehttps://github.com/makerdao/faq-test/blob/master/stability-fee.md” from 1.5 percent to 3.5 percent. According to CoinMarketCap, the stablecoin has fluctuated between $0.98 and $1.02 across global markets so far in 2019. On Coinbase Pro and Bitfinex in particular, the range has consistently hovered around $0.98 since January.  “We were giving out a good deal but unfortunately, we’ve got to lock that back a little bit until we find the right level of stability fees,” MakerDAO risk management lead Cyrus Younessi said Tuesday during a public call.  Back in February, MKR holders voted to increase the fee twice by 0.5 percent. However, an official Reddit post published Monday warns that “the impact of this combined 1 percent increase was negligible” and further states:  “Accordingly, the Internal Risk Team suggests that the incremental step size for this and future proposals be increased by 2 percent until the trend in the peg has been corrected.”  The impact of these fee increases could have far-reaching effects on several applications already leveraging the popular stablecoin for in-house operations.  For example, Gitcoin bounties are frequently denominated and paid out in DAI coins, and entire payment channel platforms – such as the Connext Network that will soon see a mainnet launch on ethereum – leverage DAI as their primary transaction medium.  DAI CDPs  At present, there are currently over 2 million ether tokens locked in MakerDAO smart contracts, accounting for roughly 2 percent of the total ether supply.  Still, most DAI adoption at the moment is taking the form of a “collateralized debt position,” meaning the user locks three times the amount of ether in a smart contract that they want to withdraw in the dollar-pegged DAI. Then, DAI holders generally liquidate the DAI on external exchanges to pay fiat bills.  The growing popularity of such loans could be a contributing factor to the destabilization of the broader network. In short, it appears organic demand for DAI itself isn’t growing as quickly as demand for loans that have essentially become a fiat off-ramp.  Based on MakerDAO’s data, the gap between DAI holders who sold out their positions and those that return to purchase DAI later that same month (presumably to pay off loans), is widening in 2019.  To be fair, MakerDAO contributors and employees are working to increase demand for the stablecoin beyond the ethereum ecosystem.  Nadia Alvarez, MakerDAO’s business development associate for Latin America, told CoinDesk that crypto-financial service companies now use DAI for backend value transfers. For example, the bitcoin exchange BuenBit and the fiat currency exchange BuenGiro both use DAI for value transfers behind the scenes.  Meanwhile, according to MakerDAO’s own statistics, the majority of new DAI holders spend the stablecoin loot within the first hour of acquiring it, presumably to liquidate the asset.  Plus, the ether collateral in any DAI CDP is automatically liquidated if the ETH price drops below 150 percent, compared to the original 300 percent collateralized. Users are not guaranteed they will get all of their collateral back. Therein lies the contradiction of DAI CDPs.  Transparency questions  So far, it’s unclear who is in charge of feeding the price-tracking data into the smart contract.  There are several players in this ecosystem, including the DAI-centric project MakerDAO and the nonprofit MKR Foundation, with a secondary MKR token that grants holders the ability to vote on DAI governance issues.  A MakerDAO spokesperson said the year-old CDP smart contract was written by “Maker developers,” including the project’s “head of Oracles,” Mariano Conti, and has also been used by companies such as Compound Finance and Gnosis.  Without specifying any person or company by name, “for security reasons,” the spokesperson explained that a “decentralized network of Maker employees, community members and people from other projects” queries roughly 14 sources, aggregates their price data and calculates the overall median price of ether.  The spokesperson added that people who hold MKR tokens are the only ones with the power to vote to add or remove data sources. This becomes a crucial focal point as DAI holders grapple with conflicting opinions on whether to increase the DAI treasury's debt ceiling.  Talk of “liquidating the [ether] collateral” if the broader market drops is a real prospect discussed during public governance meetings, although during the Feb. 28 call Christensen emphasized this consideration is only hypothetical at the moment and the team aims to prevent that type of worst-case scenario.  And, according to a study by the venture capital firm Placeholder, less than 10 percent of MKR token holders participated in the previous vote to raise stability fees to 2 percent.  Stakeholders  In order for this stablecoin to survive, it will require a diverse ecosystem of stakeholders. For now, DAI governance is managed by investors who hold the foundation’s MKR tokens, of which 6 percent is owned by Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z fund.  According to Etherscan, the top three MKR accounts hold a combined 55 percent of the tokens, with the largest account alone controlling 27 percent.  After publication of this article, MakerDAO community lead David Utrobin supplied additional information about the top accounts. The wallet with 27 percent is a developer fund, which operates through a multi-signature wallet controlled by the Maker Foundation's board.  ""This fund is meant to be fully spent within the next few years, fully distributing this large chunk of MKR,"" Utrobin said via email.  A spokesperson for crypto hedge fund Polychain Capital confirmed it owns a “significant portion” of MKR tokens.  Likewise, 1confirmation co-founder Nick Tomanio confirmed his hedge fund is also a significant holder of MKR tokens, adding:  “MakerDAO is slowly turning [bitcoin] maximalists into cryptocurrency realists and is undeniably one of the most exciting projects in the ecosystem right now in terms of both ambition and real-world usage.""  As for the rest of the top 10 holders, their names are not publicly listed. Spokespeople for both ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin, who owns the ConsenSys conglomerate that incubates MetaMask and GitCoin, and the Ethereum Foundation declined to comment on whether they own significant portions of MKR. Regardless of whether ConsenSys owns MKR, it is undoubtedly a key player pushing for broader retail adoption.  Austin Griffith, director of research at Gitcoin, developed the xDai burner wallet to help users join the system without generating private keys. According to Griffith, simplifying access to that first transaction and denominating value in dollars could make crypto more approachable for people who aren’t already familiar with tokens.  “We’re finally ready to make some of these tradeoffs,"" Griffith said, ""not having to think about .0001 ETH when you can just say you have one DAI and DAI is pegged to a dollar.”  Transparency and liability  The Maker Foundation, run by MKR token holders, funds the MakerDAO project, which is responsible for maintaining the price-monitoring system that's referred to as an Oracle.  According to MakerDAO COO Steven Becker, by 2020, DAI users will be able to take dollar-pegged loans leveraging diverse tokens, such as those formerly used by ethereum projects in token sales and invested in heavily by companies like Polychain Capital.  In the meantime, Stephen Palley, a partner at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk the lack of transparency around the DAI ecosystem and its Oracle could leave room for liability.  ""They are paradoxically creating something that is supposed to be transparent, but basing it on something that they apparently won't explain,” Palley said. “What assurance is there that liquidations are based on rational, objective, reasonable analysis? I suspect – though I don’t know – that there is an Oz behind the word Oracle. I’d be curious to know who sits behind that curtain.""  The plan for the revamped Oracle system has DAI users like Richard Burton, CEO of crypto wallet company Balance, feeling bullish. Burton took out a CDP to pay salaries at his startup. Likewise, former SpankChain employee Chelsea Palmer, who was laid off when ether prices tanked, tweeted that she plans to put her remaining ether into DAI CDPs to pay her fiat bills.  Regarding the growing use of CDP loans, Burton told CoinDesk:  “The reason Maker has gotten people so excited, including myself, is it’s finally started to deliver to people something meaningful and tangible.”  Christine Kim contributed reporting.

42430235,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpu9h,1551808506,Court Gives QuadrigaCX 45-Day Extension in Search for Crypto Millions,"A Canadian judge has granted troubled exchange QuadrigaCX a bit more breathing room as it searches for nearly $140 million in missing cryptocurrencies.  Judge Michael Wood, of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court, said he was satisfied that a stay of proceedings first granted a month ago should be extended by just under 45 days, with the next hearing scheduled for April 18. Creditors cannot sue the exchange until the stay expires or is lifted.  Appearing in court Tuesday, attorneys for Quadriga explained that the company was making progress.  ""We owe it to everyone in the process to go on as long as is reasonable,"" said Maurice Chiasson of Canadian law firm Stewart McKelvey. Chiasson has been representing Quadriga since the company filed for creditor protection at the end of January.  Elizabeth Pillon of Stikeman Elliott, representing Quadriga's court-appointed monitor Ernst & Young (EY), added that the companies are currently in the ""data recovery, asset recovery"" phase, and needed some ""breathing room"" to continue their efforts.  Wood also approved the appointment of a chief restructuring officer (CRO), an individual who would manage the exchange and related companies while working with EY in recovering the funds that Quadriga owes customers.  Chiasson explained that Jennifer Robertson, the widow of Quadriga founder and CEO Gerald Cotten, did not have much experience running a cryptocurrency-focused company, did not want the notoriety that her position has brought her and may also have a conflict of interest as the executor of Cotten's estate.  Chiasson told the court:  ""There needs to be a bit of separation here.""  Wood expressed some concerns about the potential cost to creditors, particularly if the CRO duplicated work that EY already conducted.  However, EY, Quadriga and the judge came to a compromise, where the CRO would only conduct work at the direction of EY, preventing any such duplication and keeping costs low.  Further, the CRO to be appointed – Peter Wedlake, a senior vice president at Grant Thornton – will bill at an hourly rate, rather than charge a much higher monthly fee.  Other orders  Wood granted an order compelling Amazon Web Services, which reportedly has Quadriga platform data in an account created by Cotten, to turn over any such data.  During the hearing, an attorney for EY explained that Amazon was not opposed to doing so, but could not do so without the court order as Cotten did create a personal account, rather than a business one.  The judge also hopes to speak with payment processors which have yet to turn over any funds belonging to Quadriga to either the exchange or EY. While he said some firms may have to appear in court in-person, for the moment he said speaking to representatives of each processor via telephone would be acceptable.  He deferred any order on repaying Robertson the $300,000 CAD ($225,000 USD) that she initially paid into the CCAA process.  Separately, attorneys with Miller Thomson and Cox & Palmer, the court-appointed representative counsel, updated Wood on their efforts to organize the exchange's creditors.  To date, 800 individuals have reached out directly to the law firms, said Gavin MacDonald, of Cox & Palmer. Of these, 58 have expressed interest in becoming part of the steering committee, a group of creditors who would effectively direct the representative counsel.  The law firms are in the process of interviewing the applicants and plan to have a committee selected by the end of next week. Should EY agree to the members, Wood said he would approve the committee.  End of the line?  While Wood did approve the appointment of a CRO, he noted that the title is at best symbolic, and the officer's mandate puts him into more of a manager-type role rather than a turnaround artist.  Other aspects of Quadriga's case are also different from a typical company restructuring, he noted.  Chiasson mentioned the possibility that Quadriga would sell its trading platform a number of times, though this possibility is still in the distant future.  It may become necessary to change from a creditor protection proceeding under the CCAA, which Quadriga originally filed for, to something more akin to bankruptcy, Wood added, concluding:  ""This isn't so much a restructuring as it is a claims process and liquidation ... it does look like an end process.""

For the effort, the San Francisco-based firm has teamed up with accounting firm Armanino, which has developed a dashboard that provides an up-to-date, third-party view of TUSD in circulation and their related collateralized fiat funds.  To do that, Armanino connects with the escrow bank accounts holding TrustToken's U.S. dollar collateral, as well as running ethereum nodes to monitor TUSD supply. With the new service, the ""transparency"" time frame for this information drops ""from months to minutes,"" said TrustToken in an announcement on Tuesday.  “This sets a new standard not only for stablecoins, but for all tokenized assets in the future,” said Rafael Cosman, TrustToken co-founder and head of engineering and product. “With real-time confirmation of funds provided by one of the world’s leading accounting firms, traders will know at all times that their tokens are backed by real-world value.”  Noah Buxton, director of risk assurance and advisory at Armanino, added that his firm believes that ""continuous assurance and audit is no longer a far-off future, but rather an imminent reality.”  The dashboard is slated for launch ""by early April,"" TrustToken said, and will be open for anyone to access via Armanino's website.  In the same announcement, TrustToken said it has reduced the minimum TrueUSD purchase and redemption amount to $1,000.  It's also launched a ""1-click redemption process,"" allowing verified users to send TUSD tokens to a ""personal redemption address"" from any wallet to have the same amount in U.S. dollars automatically wired to their bank account. The 1-click redemptions can also be automated for trading desks, TrustToken said.  The news comes several months after another stablecoin launched offering a real-time view of its dollar backing. Stably announced in November that its StableUSD (USDS) token was backed by USD held in Prime Trust escrow accounts and that these holding were visible ""via a live feed from Prime Trust’s API.""  The issue of transparency of stablecoin collateral has been highlighted by the controversies surrounding Tether's popular USDT token. The firm has not provided a full independent audit and has occasionally slipped from its dollar peg.

42430226,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMptrh,1551793505,BlockFi Now Offers a Crypto Deposit Account With Compound Interest,"Cryptocurrency lending startup BlockFi has launched a crypto deposit account that provides compound interest.  Announcing the news on Tuesday, the firm said that the BlockFi Interest Account (BIA) is now live and offers customers an annual interest rate of 6 percent, paid on a monthly basis in cryptocurrency. That monthly interest is then compounded to produce a 6.2 percent annual percentage yield or APY.  “It helps crypto investors grow their wealth with one of the most powerful tools in finance – compound interest,” Brad Michelson, director of marketing at BlockFi told CoinDesk.  Users from across the globe can deposit either bitcoin (BTC) or ether (ETH) to earn interest from the offering and can withdraw their funds at any time, BlockFi said.  Account holdings are custodied at the Gemini Trust Company, co-founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, according to the announcement. Gemini Trust is regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services and also offers insurance coverage for the digital assets it holds in custody.  While the BIA looks rather like the crypto version of a traditional savings account, Michelson told CoinDesk that the product ""doesn’t come with the backing of the federal government like a savings account at a bank does.”  The executive further said that, as BlockFi's business also includes providing crypto loans to institutions, it can still afford the interest paid out, even if the prices of bitcoin and ether fall. ""We charge more to the institutions borrowing the crypto from BlockFi then we pay to depositors,"" Michelson explained.  The BIA was first launched in beta version at the start of this year and already holds over $10 million in assets from retail and institutional investors, according to the firm's figures.  Back in December, BlockFi raised $4 million in a round that was led by Akuna Capital, with participation from Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital Ventures and Anthony Pompliano’s Morgan Creek Digital, among others.  It also raised $52.5 million last July, in a round led by Galaxy Digital, and further secured $1.55 million early in 2018 with backing from ConsenSys Ventures, SoFi, Kenetic Capital and others.

42430233,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpu3h,1551789650,"Crypto Exchange WEX Linked to Iranian Ransomware Operators, Says PwC","Cryptocurrency exchange WEX, successor to the shuttered BTC-e exchange, has again been tied to illicit funds gained through ransomware attacks.  According to a recent bulletinhttps://www.pwc.de/de/strategie-organisation-prozesse-systeme/strategic-intelligence-bulletin-airing-digital-currencys-dirty-laundry.pdf from consulting firm PwC, two Iranians said to have created the SamSam ransomware variant have been tied to the exchange and may have used it to launder their millions in illegal earnings.  Iranians Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri were formally charged by the U.S. Department of Justice last November, for deploying SamSam ransomware to extort funds from hospitals, local governments and public institutions. The six-count indictment alleged that the duo collected over $6 million in ransom payments and caused over $30 million in losses to victims.  At the time, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) also added two other Iran residents, Ali Khorashadizadeh and Mohammad Ghorbaniyan, to its Specially Designated Nationals list for their role in facilitating financial transactions related to the SamSam ransomware on behalf of Savandi and Mansouri.  The OFAC also connected bitcoin addresses associated with Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan, with other identifying information, such as physical addresses, post office boxes, email addresses and aliases.  PwC said it analyzed the addresses provided by the OFAC and found that two exchange websites – Enexchanger and Iranvisacart – are connected to Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan, and allow payments through WEX. The FBI has previously linked both sites with money laundering, according to the report.  The Enexchanger website, for example, listed trading pairs including in cryptocurrencies, PwC said, adding “One of the cryptocurrency swaps offered is WEX-code to USD, which is a code that allows transferring of funds directly from [WEX] users.”  Further, citing evidence from a firm that tracks illicit crypto activity, PwC said that WEX/BTC-e and a crypto exchange based in Slovakia have been used to launder bitcoin by a threat actor tracked as ""Blue Athena.""  “The use of Iran- and Slovakia-based exchanges suggests that threat actors favour using lesser-known currency exchanges,"" PwC said. ""This is likely because the more popular exchanges have monitoring or compliance programmes to detect illicit activities.""  WEX rose from the ashes of the BTC-e platform after it was shuttered by international law enforcement officials in 2017. At the same time, its alleged operator, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested over claims he had laundered some $4 billion in bitcoin since 2011.  In its report, PwC said of the exchange:  “WEX is most notably known for its alleged involvement in the laundering of some USD 4 billion, transferring of funds to facilitate operations of the threat actor tracked by PwC as Blue Athena, and being responsible for cashing out 95% of all ransomware payments made since 2014.""  In October 2018, cryptocurrency exchange Binance also froze accounts that received more than 93,000 ether from two wallets indirectly linked to WEX/BTC-e.

42430242,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpuPh,1551784220,Bitcoin Seeking Gains After Retaking Key Price Support,"View  Bitcoin's immediate outlook will remain neutral while prices are trapped in the range of $3,658-$3,900.  If the bulls can keep prices above the 5-week MA support at $3,703, we could see a rally above $4,000. The average is reporting bullish conditions for the first time since August.  On the downside, a UTC close below $3,658 (Feb. 27 low) would revive the bearish view put forward by the high-volume sell-off on Feb. 24 and open the doors for a drop to levels below $3,400.  Bitcoin (BTC) has returned above crucial support at $3,700 and could bounce higher if it can defend that level going forward.  The crypto market leader fell 2.4 percent yesterday to $3,670, raising the odds of the bears coming out victorious from the ongoing tug-of-war with the bulls in the range of $3,658-$3,900. Prices, however, are still trapped in that trading range, so the immediate outlook is neutral.  Notably, sellers have been struggling to secure a convincing break below the widely-followed 5-week moving average (MA) located at $3,703. The MA is now trending north and is holding above the 10-week MA for the first time since August 2018, indicating the path of least resistance is to the higher side.  A repeated defense of that level could invite a wave of buying and a re-test of recent highs near $4,200. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $3,720 on Bitstamp  Weekly chart  As seen above, the 5- and 10-week MAs have produced a bullish crossover for the first time in six months.  Further, the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) histogram is printing a strongest bullish signal in over a year, while the money flow index has breached the upper edge of its current channel, validating a bullish divergence confirmed in December.  A strong bounce from the 5-week MA could yield re-test of $4,190 (last week’s high). A weekly close (Sunday, UTC) above that level would confirm a bullish reversal and open the doors to the psychological hurdle of $5,000.  Daily chart  On the daily chart, the 5- and 10-candle MAs are trending south, indicating a bearish setup. Prices, however, are still holding above $3,658 (low of the long-tailed candle created on Feb. 27).  A UTC close below that level could put the focus back on the big bearish outside reversal candle charted on Feb. 24 and trigger a sell-off to levels below $3,400. The sell-off, however, could be short-lived, unless it is backed by a surge in trading volumes.  Disclosure: The author holds no cryptocurrency assets at the time of writing.

42430230,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMptxh,1551783635,Futures Trading Nears $1 Billion in First Month at Kraken Crypto Exchange,"Cryptocurrency futures provider Crypto Facilities has seen ""tremendous growth"" since being acquired by U.S.-based crypto exchange Kraken last month, an executive said.  Sui Chung, the subsidiary's head of indices and pricing products, told CoinDesk that trading volume has increased more than 500 percent since Kraken acquired the futures exchange at the beginning of February for $100 million.  Crypto Facilities is perhaps best known in the U.S. for providing bitcoin and ether reference rates to CME Group, which lists bitcoin futures contracts.  In total, nearly $1 billion in crypto futures has been traded over the past month, across all five products offered by the firm: bitcoin, ether, XRP, litecoin and bitcoin cash, Chung said. Moreover, this growth is not limited to the largest coins by market cap.  ""Our [daily] users have gone up by a factor of four and that’s across all products, not just major coins but … they’ve all seen similar growth,"" he said.  Part of this boost comes from the Kraken acquisition itself, Chung said:  ""I think obviously having the support of a major U.S. exchange helped and obviously Kraken bringing our product set to a very loyal user base ... that Kraken branding carries a lot of weight ... and also the fact that because we run contracts on the major five coins and take collateral on the major five coins ... we pay out in [helped].""  Volume jump  While specific numbers for pre-acquisition trading were not shared, Chung did outline how Crypto Facilities is measuring its relative volume.  In terms of trading volume, Crypto Facilities compared the five-day period before Feb. 4, when the Kraken acquisition was announced, to the five-day period after, finding that the volume of trades on its platform jumped 565 percent.  This period acts as a good ""yardstick"" for the rest of the month, he said.  While bitcoin is still the most popular asset, and maintains the largest contracts, ethereum and XRP have both also seen large numbers.  Part of this may be due to Kraken itself, Chung said.  ""Outside of bitcoin and ether, one of the strengths of Kraken is obviously running some of the most liquid markets for bitcoin cash and litecoin, and that's translated over to our market as well,"" he said.  Looking at the acquisition's impact on liquidity, Chung said:  ""On average [looking at] the five days before the announcement and five days after, the liquidity for our contracts increased by over 200 percent and some of the minor [coin] contracts increased by over 1,000 percent.""  These minor currency contracts include litecoin and bitcoin cash.  The user base overall has grown 400 percent over the last month, when compared to the month before the acquisition, with most of the new customers coming from Kraken. This translates to more than 5,000 new customers signed up since Feb. 4.  Perhaps most notably, none of these new customers are based in the U.S.  ""We don't allow any U.S. nationals or corporates to trade on our market because that is prohibited by the [U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission],"" Chung explained.  As a result, the exchange's user base comes from Europe and most of Asia.  Going forward  Beyond simply adding customers, Chung noted that Kraken’s user base has been vocal about what its members are looking for.  ""Kraken users are very vocal about what products they want to see and what features they want to see, [and] that feedback is very useful for our product guys,"" he said.  This feedback includes improvements to the company’s user interface, the availability of certain features and upgraded tools, much of which Crypto Facilities’ product team is adding to the exchange on an ongoing basis.  The company also plans to release new products in the near future, though no details were made available by press time.  ""[We take a] two-tiered kind of approach, you’ve obviously got that constant improvement ... and you’ve got the product development that’s longer term,” he said. “It’s very useful for us to get that good, honest feedback.""

42430236,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpuBh,1551780049,EY Aims to Make It Easier to Calculate Crypto Taxes With New Tool,"“Big Four” consulting firm EY has launched a tool to help cryptocurrency users with their accounting and tax calculations.  The firm announced Monday that the software solution, called EY Crypto-Asset Accounting and Tax (CAAT), was designed to assist its U.S. customers prepare Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax returns related to crypto assets.  CAAT can source transaction information from ""virtually all major exchanges,"" the firm said, pulling together data from various sources and automating production of different dashboards and reports, as well as tax returns.  The product is aimed to serve both institutional clients, as well as individuals, as EY said it has seen “significant” growth in the number of customers that hold and trade cryptocurrencies.  “From a retail client perspective, the product will be leveraged for high net worth individuals served by the EY Private Client Services practice and made available to users of EY TaxChat, a mobile tax preparation service that pairs users with licensed and experienced EY professionals who prepare individual tax returns,” the firm said.  The firm further suggested that the software will benefit asset management firms in particular, because crypto assets continue to evolve and increase in utility.  ""The initial validation we have received from the market has been phenomenal, but it only represents the beginning,"" said Michael Meisler, partner and global blockchain tax leader at EY.  With the calculation of crypto taxes being often frustratingly complex, tools to assist the process are increasing in number. Most recently, crypto exchange Coinbase integrated TurboTax, the tax-filing software offered by Intuit Consumer Tax Group, for its U.S. customers.  At the time, Coinbase also integrated CoinTracker, a Y Combinator-backed crypto and bitcoin tax software manager built by former Google employees, to further help its customers.

Dash Core Group (DCG) CEO Ryan Taylor announced late last month that the firm has decided to lay off four employees across several business areas – eight percent of its staff – to “reduce costs and align them with the available budget.”  As a result, the human resources department will no longer exist, two people will be leaving the strategy section and the business development team will be reduced by one person. The layoffs will come into effect on March 7.  Taylor said  “This was not a decision we took lightly and we’ve been actively finding ways to reduce the budget over the past several months.""  DCG seems to have a total of 49 employees currently, according to information on its website.  The affect of the cryptocurrency bear market over the last year has also seen some of DCG staff taking voluntary salary cuts and losing employee benefits in order to “maintain the company’s financial health” without increasing the overall budget, Taylor said. There has also been a hiring freeze in place for over six months at the firm.  “Our monthly payments for January invoices yielded an average of ~$67 / Dash, which is the lowest price we’ve experienced since ‘crypto winter’ began,"" Taylor said. ""We remain committed to keeping our proposal requests below 60 percent of the available budget.”  With the staff changes, DCG further announced some operational changes to its business functions. For instance, human resources-related duties be will be shifted primarily to the firm’s chief financial officer, Glenn Austin. Strategy projects will transition to each of the relevant functions and Taylor himself will be taking a key role in business development.  Notably, last December Taylor maintained that DCG's business is “sustainable.”  He said at the time:  “DCG is not at risk of shutting down anytime soon, or of any significant cuts in staffing levels in the near term. We have a significant buffer in place to withstand the impact of the market bottom, whenever that comes.”  The firm is the latest to announce layoffs in the blockchain space as low crypto prices adversely affect business models. Last month, smart contract auditing firm Hosho cut 80 percent of its staff after business slowed in 2018. And, in January, blockchain project Nebulas axed 60 percent of its team, while the NEM Foundation also announced planned staffing cuts.

42430231,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpu1h,1551773441,Underwriter Claims Crypto Custodian BitGo Exaggerated Insurance Coverage,"One of the underwriters behind BitGo’s $100 million cryptocurrency insurance policy has accused the custodian of exaggerating the scope of its coverage by using “ambiguous language” in public statements.  The controversy boils down to three words. In its February 20 press release, BitGo listed “third-party hacks” among the risks covered by a group of 10 Lloyd’s of London underwriters.  That was misleading, according to one of the group’s 10 members, since it implies the policy covered hacks of “hot,” or online wallets. In fact, the policy strictly covers theft or loss of assets kept in “cold storage,” meaning the cryptographic keys are kept offline.  In an email to insurance brokers obtained by CoinDesk, this underwriter said,  “ ... the BitGo Specie policy absolutely does NOT provide any cover for remote ‘third party hacks.’ [...] Cover is only provided for ‘storage media’ in secure storage. In other words, there is no cover for any loss of sensitive information (private keys) resulting from the generation, transportation or transaction phases of the private keys’ life cycle.”  As such, the coverage is limited to “hacks” of “offline private keys,” requiring the third party to obtain direct physical access to them, noted the underwriter, whose email was shared with CoinDesk on the condition that his company not be identified.  The official went on to describe the language in the announcement as “ambiguous,” but added that since his firm did not lead this policy, it had “no say over the language used in the press release.”  When contacted by CoinDesk, BitGo argued it had used clear and specific wording, noting that right before the line about “third-party hacks,” the press release stated the insurance “covers digital assets where the offline private keys are held 100% by” the custodian (emphasis added here). The company also said Lloyd’s had reviewed and approved this wording.  BitGo told CoinDesk in a statement,  “Working with our insurance underwriters, it is understood that a hack in the cold storage context includes unauthorized access or theft of private keys. This refers not only to the hardware but more specifically to the cryptographic series of alphanumeric characters generated, which permits the release of cryptocurrency from a Public Address.”  Due to the nature of digital assets, the inherent threat is the use of a computer, USB device, frequency reader, etc. to hack or breach cold wallet hardware, software, or processes, said BitGo.  “Cold storage involves devices and cryptographic keys that are not exposed to online networks removing the threat vector of remote network access, but there are other attack vectors that would involve technology,” it said.  More than semantic  It might be tempting to dismiss the underwriter's complaints as sour grapes or pedantry. But it’s understandable why an underwriter would be worried about its risks being misconstrued.  Stepping back, specialist insurance policies such as those for crypto are handled by groups of underwriters, known in industry parlance as “towers.” The lead underwriter, which understands the risk deeply, will offer the first $10 million of losses, say, and then the rest of the capital gets filled out by the other syndicates further up the tower, which will demand a smaller premium.  All this is negotiated at the Lloyd's of London market, which sets rules for conduct among participants.  In the case of the BitGo policy, AMTrust was the lead underwriter and the only one that the company identified when it announced the coverage. The underwriter who wrote the email was one of the syndicates taking on a smaller exposure. (Both Lloyd’s and AMTrust declined to comment.)  It’s also important to remember that crypto insurance is thin on the ground and a large amount of cover for hot wallets, which are typically the target of third-party hacks, is especially hard to come by.  Some large exchanges simply hold disaster funds of bitcoin to cover these losses themselves. According to insurance industry sources, there is a stark disparity in premiums depending on whether the crypto being insured is in a hot or cold wallet – the hot ones carrying the more expensive price tag.  Hence, if anyone who read BitGo’s announcement had incorrectly inferred that “third-party hacks” meant hot wallet coverage, as the underwriter feared, they might draw unrealistic conclusions about the market.  ""As a public relations event, the press release may have been a success, but there is certainly nothing newsworthy with respect to the scope of the cover,"" said Jerry Pluard, the president of Safe Deposit Box Insurance Coverage, an insurance broker in the Chicago area who arranges crypto policies for custodians.  The underwriter said in his email he would meet with Lloyd’s “in an attempt to obtain some consistency in their approach to media communications going forward,” concluding:  “At the end of the day a responsible and clear press release would benefit not only the crypto industry but Lloyd’s as well.”  BitGo CEO Mike Belshe image via CoinDesk archives",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TECHNOLOGY,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/03/05/underwriter-claims-crypto-custodian-bitgo-exaggerated-insurance-coverage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a301291419eb5e3b030f53a120c45f984355352a-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42430237,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMpuFh,1551763823,"Bitcoin Miners Are Investing Again, Expecting a Cheap Power Boom Soon","Bitcoin miners in China are buying used equipment and making deals with mining farms and hydroelectric plants, betting abundant water this summer will make their businesses profitable again.  That's because during this season a significant amount of excess electricity is expected to be generated by hundreds of hydropower stations, especially in China’s mountainous southwestern provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. This level of excess power results in competitive electricity costs for bitcoin miners, making it perhaps one of the rare opportunities to earn profits in the current bear market that has already impacted the mining sector.  Hashage, a company based in the city of Chengdu in Sichuan that operates six mining farms with a supply of about 200,000 slots for machines, for example, said the electricity cost in Sichuan during the summer – which may vary from hydropower plants – is usually around 0.25 yuan, or $0.037, per kilowatt hour (kWh) for hosting equipment for miners.  Xun Zheng, the company's CEO, told CoinDesk that over the past month the firm has been talking to individual miners and larger mining farms with a total demand of more than 1 million slots for deploying mining chips. According to Zheng, individual miners on average are looking to host 1,000 to 3,000 units of mining equipment each, while larger farms are eyeing at a larger scale of over tens of thousands of machines.  He added although the exact electricity costs with local hydropower stations won’t be finalized until the end of March, miners have already started looking for resources and negotiating deals with mining farms before the season comes so that they have enough time to ship equipment to the mountains and set them up.  ""The interest is definitely there,"" Zheng said, adding most of the miners that have shown enthusiasm are from China’s Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang provinces, where they operate mining farms using fossil power plants. The electricity costs there are usually around 0.35 yuan, or $0.052, per 1 kWh.  Even just the difference of 0.01 Chinese yuan ($0.0015) is significant for bitcoin miners, especially in the current bear market when one bitcoin is worth about $3,700 as of press time.  Take for example, Bitmain’s AntMiner S9, which consumes about 30 kWh per day, only one kilowatt-hour more than the average U.S. home in 2017.  That means for each machine, an additional $0.045 can be saved per day from the seemingly negligible difference. For a miner that has 10,000 machines, that’s a difference of $450 per day, and $13,500 a month.  Second-hand in demand  Adding to this level of interest is also the relatively cheap cost of buying second-hand bitcoin ASICs, especially used AntMiner S9s, Zheng said.  According to him, a used S9, depending on the level of damage, could be bought for about $150, with a computing capacity of a bit over 10 trillion hashes per second (TH/s).  Indeed, some wholesalers in China are currently selling second-hand S9s on the e-commerce marketplace Alibaba for $100 to $200 each. While manufacturer Bitmain’s official website lists the price of brand new S9 to be around $450, other wholesalers are advertising alternative channels for users to buy new S9 equipment for around $300.  Tyler Xiong, chief marketing officer of mining pool and wallet service Bixin, echoed that point, saying the last round of miners shutting down operations at the end of 2018 resulted in the increased availability of second-hand equipment.  “S9 is now like the AK-47 [assault rifle] in ASICs,” Xiong said. “It now has the best performance over cost ratio in the market.” Bixin is also planning to increase its own mining capacity in Sichuan during the summer but declined to disclose its planned scale ahead.  Summing up all the estimated supplies provided by major mining farms in the area, Zheng projects there will be a total of about 1.5 million slots available.  He explained that it’s a common practice for mining farms to sign agreements with power stations to purchase 80 percent of the plants’ capacity in advance. That means that whether or not a mining farm has enough miners to consume all the pledged amount, it has to pay for what it has agreed on, one way or another.  Because of that, Zheng said besides hosting machines for miners, his firm also plans to deploy around 20,000 ASICs to mine on its own behalf, with second-hand machines bought on the market.  He further estimated that the entire bitcoin network hash rate could even go up to 70 quintillion hashes per second (EH/s) in the summer, which is well above the network’s historical high of 61 EH/s, recorded in the summer of 2018.  In fact, over the last two months, bitcoin’s hash rate has already shown steady growth, from an average around 35 EH/s in early January to now around 42 EH/s, according to data from blockchain.info.  “We used to think the overall supply would be larger than the demand. But the total quantity of ASICs on the market, plus new machines produced by major manufacturers, can certainly fill in the total supply. The question now is how many miners will take this bet,” Zheng said.  Market shift  But every year in the summer, there’s plenty of rain and water in the Garze and Ngawa Tibetan prefectures in western Sichuan, where many of these mining farms are located.  What makes this year different from previous years, though, is a shift in market dynamics.  Yun Zhao, a co-founder of Hashage who has left the firm’s management to start a miner organization in Sichuan called Mining Sea, explained that the market used to be on the side of mining equipment makers as well as mining farms.  “In the bullish market, it was hard to buy mining equipment, it was hard to find available slots in mining farms, because the electricity cost wasn’t too big of an issue,” Zhao told CoinDesk.  That’s also the reason he started the organization in Sichuan in the first place this year, aiming to improve liquidity between mining farms’ supplies and demand from miners.  “In the bearish market, we’ve got to huddle together and find better ways to utilize our resources,” Zhao said.  Xiong of Bixin shared the same view. “In this round, the market’s dominance will shift to miners and whatever farms that can get the cheapest electricity cost. They are the ones that can really rock,” he said, adding:  “Mining equipment makers probably won’t have much sense of participation in this round [in terms of selling new machines] since people may prefer used ones. So, the market is no longer on their side now.”  Excess power supply  Further adding to the current level of interest is also an openness from local governments to let privately owned hydropower stations participate in a more market-driven electricity trade so that excess energy can be sold to private companies in energy-intensive industries.  Stepping back, privately owned hydropower plants in China can be divided into two categories: those that are integrated with the country’s State Grid and those that are not.  For those that are eligible for the integration, the State Grid would typically buy a certain agreed amount of electricity from them so their sources of income could be steady. But for those that are not, they need to compete for steady customers that consume generated energy.  The Sichuan provincial government issued a notice in August 2018 as a practical guide to “deepen the electricity reformation” in the region.  Although the notice did not mention any specific industry, it emphasized “enlarging the scope of customers that can participate in electricity trades” while “reducing administrative interference in the market.”  The end goal would be to better utilize the excess electricity generated in the area, which would otherwise be wasted. The notice also mentioned the government would continue the experiment of establishing industrial parks near plants that have significant excess power.  According to another notice issued by the Garze prefecture government, hydropower plants in the area generated 41.5 billion kWh of electricity just in 2017 with a total excess of 16.3 billion kWh that went to waste.  It’s still a bet  But even with this alluring opportunity, the risk still remains.  Both Zhao and Zheng said the main risk lies in the possibility of bitcoin’s price dropping below a threshold of $3,000, even with cheap electricity costs. According to the revenue index for mining machines provided by f2pool, the fourth largest mining pool by hash power, mining with an S9 at an average electricity cost of $0.05 per 1 kWh can still generate a marginal daily profit of $0.60 per machine.  “But if the price falls below that threshold of $3,000 during the summer, lots of miners may have to pull the plug again,” Zhao added.  Although it’s a common practice for miners to short bitcoin futures contracts to hedge potential losses, Zhao said a potential risk in that situation is there may not be enough counterparties to take the long positions.  He added another long-time issue in the industry is a lack of self-governance to protect miners from bad actors, which is an area where the Mining Sea organization aims to improve on by updating their members about any bad conduct from mining farms if found.  For instance, he said there were cases where mining farms secretly switched the network address of mining equipment they hosted for customers to that of their own at 2 a.m. in the morning just for two hours to mine for themselves.  Zheng said there were also mining farms that lured miners with the promise of cheap electricity rates but then jacked up the price after they set up machines.  “Those miners had no choices but to suck it up,” he added, referring to recent local reports that similar situations happened in China’s Qinghai province.  Zheng concluded:  “This industry is always about making a bet after all. There are always risks from multiple aspects, especially from the markets side in this bearish time.”  Mining farm image courtesy of Hashage",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | BTC | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/03/05/bitcoin-miners-are-investing-again-expecting-a-cheap-power-boom-soon,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6119363755a317c303ed9257c4a3b280ddbc6da0-1920x2560.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
