42426650,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvuxh,1456778727,Report: Bitcoin Wallet Providers Failing to Make Privacy a Priority,"Bitcoin wallet providers haven't focused on increasing privacy to promote consumer financial independence and safety over the last year, according to the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project’s (OBPP) second edition survey.  As no provider received a score of more than 50 out of 100, the OBPP suggests privacy work has stagnated within the bitcoin wallet industry and that improvements to these services are greatly needed.  While new bitcoin wallet providers have begun adopting hierarchical deterministic (HD) architecture for advanced security, the OBPP contends that many privacy advances from 2014, including Tor support and stealth addresses, were not incorporated by wallet providers in 2015.  The project wrote in its latest analysis:  ""Wallets seem to be mostly in a holding pattern, waiting for their competitors to take the lead on innovating.""  Ranvier told CoinDesk that OBPP's criteria is designed to ""leave room for improvement"", but that he believes the low scores are a reflection of bitcoin wallet providers and their sometimes slow efforts to address privacy bugs and leaks.  Since the first edition of the report, OBPP has increased the number of criteria it looks at when ranking wallets from 38 to 68 and doubled the number of wallets it reviewed from 10 to 20.  The report  is a follow up to its first survey, released in May 2015 with the aim of improving financial privacy within the bitcoin ecosystem. Contributors to the open-source effort include Blockchain security engineer Kristov Atlas and Stash Crypto software designer Justus Ranvier.  Top performers  Bitcoin hardware wallet provider Ledger took the top spot for most privacy-attentive wallet, scoring a 50 out of 100.  The company got high marks for having a variety of smartcard-based hardware wallets, including Ledger Nano. The USB stick wallet stores user's private keys and when inserted into a computer and validated with a PIN allows users to send and receive to multiple accounts.  Ledger's Chrome extension also outperformed its competitors due to an interface that moves users away from reusing addresses and allows for management of multiple accounts within a single wallet.  The extension was deducted points, though, for its lack of advanced privacy features including mixing.  BreadWallet  and Airbitz came in second and third, respectively.  BreadWallet received high marks for its use of simplified payment verification (SPV), an option the OBPP lauded for eliminating potential data leaks when transmitting information between other wallet providers and mobile clients.  Likewise, Airbitz was given praise as being one of the first wallets to provide HD architecture. Further, its transaction broadcasting is done through one or more Obelisk servers offering more privacy than the single server models most other wallets use, the report said.  Improvements needed  Darkwallet, which tied for first place last year, was ranked fourth this year with the same 45 out of 100 score. According to the OBPP, the wallet's offering remains strong, but it cautioned that there has been a lack of development on the release since February 2015.  Darkwallet tied with Armory last year, but Armory’s ranking dropped to 13th this year with a score of 38 out of 100, a move that coincides with rumors about uncertainty regarding that project’s future.  Venture-backed Coinbase, again, ranked last in the survey this year. OBPP explained that the company's custodianship of customer funds and stringent identification process were two reasons for the low score.  As a regulated entity, Coinbase must comply with know-your-customer (KYC) rules, although OBPP said the company could discourage bitcoin address reuse to enhance privacy without violating those guidelines.  Coinbase recently published a Medium post explaining that it sees itself as more of a retail exchange than a wallet provider.

42426655,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvv9h,1456778523,IBM Exec Elected Chair of Hyperledger Blockchain Committee,"UPDATE (1st March 1:15am BST): Updated with comment from the Linux Foundation.      An IBM executive has been named as the chairman of the technical committee for the Hyperledger Project, the open-source blockchain initiative launched late last year under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation.  Chris Ferris  , CTO of open cloud in the IBM cloud division's open technology unit, was elected chairman during a vote that took place earlier this month. The outcome was announced during a committee call on 25th February.  Representatives from a variety of mainstream financial and technology firms, including Accenture, CME Group, Deutsche Boerse, DTCC, IBM, Intel and JPMorgan, as well as blockchain startups Digital Asset Holdings and R3CEV, make up the membership of the committee.  In a statement, the Linux Foundation lauded Ferris and the depth of knowledge he brings to the project, stating:  ""We look forward to his contributions and collaboration among other TSC members on open-standards and open-source development for this project.""  Ferris will now serve a six-month term, after which point another election will take place.  His role on the committee is notable given IBM's enthusiastic support for the Hyperledger project, which formally kicked off in December. The firm later launched a suite of blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) tools, offerings that overlap, in part, with the Hyperledger initiative.  The meeting also saw a discussion of a joint proposal by IBM and blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings. Up for debate is how the Hyperledger code could take shape in the months ahead, and how two different approaches to blockchain applications could be merged into one.  The proposal  offers details on the nature of the discussions taking place as Hyperledger participants solidify the project’s governance structure.  The document states:  ""It is clear that the [Hyperledger] community is split over use of the bitcoin model (UTXO). We believe that the community should be looking to quickly realize a single implementation in which the UTXO model and alternate model(s) - that provide a more elegant (and likely better performing) approach to satisfying more complex use cases - are equally supported.""  Members of the Hyperledger technology community are expected to meet next month. According to event minutes, meetings will take place over the course of March.

42426665,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvPh,1456761041,Korea's Securities Exchange Developing Blockchain Trading System,"The Korea Exchange (KRX), South Korea’s lone securities exchange, is reportedly moving to create an over-the-counter (OTC) trading platform using blockchain tech.  According to The Korea Times, KRX is in the early stages of developing a system for trades using code like that that underlying bitcoin and other digital currencies. An exchange representative told the publication that the platform could help its OTC traders reduce the cost of transactions.  The representative told the newspaper:  ""Though many steps remain before the system's official launch, we expect this would help off-board dealers to trade more easily by saving their costs and efforts in seeking trade partners.""  The move makes KRX the latest firm to explore use of the technology to facilitate securities trades.  New exchange on the blockchain  Notably, KRX is just one of a number of stock exchange operators investigating applications for the blockchain.  US-based NASDAQ launched Linq, a platform for private securities trading developed with blockchain startup Chain, in November. The Australian Stock Exchange is also looking to integrate elements of the technology, a move that followed an investment in blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings' recent funding round.  Private firms are also looking to gain headway in the securities trade space through blockchain tech. Last summer, online retailer Overstock unveiled its tØ public and private securities trading platform, on which the company spent as much as $8m developing in 2015.  KRX was created in 2005, after the country’s three major securities exchanges were merged. The exchange reported $7.1bn in daily stock trading value for 2015.

42426657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyJvvBh,1456754255,Russia's Central Bank to Study Blockchain Tech,"The Bank of Russia has announced plans to ""analyse and evaluate"" potential applications of blockchain technology within finance.  The country's central bank revealed on Sunday it had established a working group that will provide analysis of ""advanced technologies and innovations in the financial market"", with the goal being to study distributed ledger technologies, as well as developments in mobile, payments and other areas.  The news comes at a time when certain public entities in Russia are supporting a possible ban on monetary surrogates, a classification that includes digital currencies. Officials from groups including Russia's Ministry of Finance, the government agency overseeing financial policy; members of the state duma, one of the country's legislatures; and its Investigative Committee, which investigates criminal offenses, have all previously voiced concerns about the technology.  Russia's central bank, by contrast, has been more positive about the technology, issuing more measured statements as far back as 2014.  Olga Skorobogatov, the Bank of Russia's Deputy Chairman, and the leader of the new group, said in a statement:  ""The development of modern financial market[s] is inseparable from the development of financial technology.""  Financial services is quickly digitising, and new business models, ecosystems and market participants are ""changing the behavior of consumers of financial services"", Skorobogatov added.  The working group plans to hold regular meetings with representatives of banks, self-regulatory organisations and other financial market participants to discuss the use of new financial technologies.  The Bank of Russia's head, Elvira Nabiullina, earlier this month announced that the bank was ""closely monitoring"" blockchain technology with the aim of ""developing its own approach to financial innovation"".  Growing user base  Sunday's announcement also comes hot on the heels of a report from Russia's official news agency Tass last week, which claimed that the country ranks fifth for number of cryptocurrency users globally.  Users of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies now number 200,000, with only the US, China and Germany having higher numbers, said deputy chairman of the Russian State Duma committee for security and anti-corruption, Andrei Lugovoi [Ed –his figures actually making Russia fourth, not fifth].  Lugovoi noted that, while the central bank had previously held a somewhat negative stance towards cryptocurrencies, it was now in favour of a ""careful approach to bitcoin, and saw a serious economic potential"" in the technology.  The Ministry of Finance, on the other hand, has made a number of statements condemning bitcoin, though it has conceded the potential use case for blockchains in finance.

The comments came as part of Ruane, Cunniff & Goldfarb’s annual report on the performance of the Sequoia Fund, the firm’s consolidated portfolio offering. The Sequoia Fund currently holds stock in 10 publicly traded companies as part of its portfolio, with MasterCard accounting for 4.3% of its assets.  In the report, Sequoia praised MasterCard for its strong performance since its 2006 IPO, but indicated that it believes new technologies, including blockchain, will begin to affect the company’s value.  Sequoia wrote:  ""MasterCard’s virtues are well-appreciated by the stock market but the evolution of mobile payment habits and the rise of blockchain ledger technology could pose longer term challenges to the company’s wildly profitable business model.""  The fund has a storied track record among investors, returning three times more than the S&P 500 during its more successful runs.  In addition to MasterCard, other Sequoia Capital portfolio holdings include Berkshire Hathaway, O’Reilly Automotive and Alphabet, Google’s parent firm.
