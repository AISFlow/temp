42414911,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBUBZQ,1668642154,Crypto Exchange Gemini Suffers $485M Rush of Outflows Amid Contagion Fears,"Gemini, a crypto exchange and custodian founded by the Winklevoss brothers, has suffered a rush of withdrawals as crypto firms wrestle with the reverberations of the FTX-Alameda bankruptcy and subsequent contagion within the digital asset industry.  Data by blockchain intelligence platform Nansen shows that Gemini saw $485 million in net outflows in the past 24 hours, the largest among crypto exchanges. Outflows totaled $563 million, and were offset by only $78 million in inflows. In the past seven days, Gemini experienced a total of $682 million net outflows – the difference of $866 billion of inflows and $1.55 billion of inflows provided by Nansen – suggesting that most of the withdrawals have occurred on Wednesday.  Digital asset balances on crypto wallets identified as Gemini dropped to $1.7 billion from about $2.2 billion a day ago, according to blockchain data platform Arkham Intelligence. Arkham and Nansen do not cover data from the Bitcoin blockchain and may not include all Gemini’s wallets.  The rush of withdrawals came as Gemini paused withdrawals earlier Wednesday from its yield-generating Earn program. The lending unit of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading, which powered the program for Gemini, announced that it was suspending customer redemptions citing “extreme market dislocation” and “loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion.""

A Gemini spokesperson told CoinDesk that the firm did not see the withdrawal surge ""as a material outflow"" and the exchange has ""seen net inflows and outflows of this size on many occasions depending on market conditions."" Earlier today, the firm said in a tweet that all assets deposited by customers are available to withdraw at any time.  Contagion fear looms  Pressure has mounted on crypto exchanges and lending firms dealing with the implosion of top exchange FTX and its corporate sibling, trading firm Alameda Research.  Cautious investors have scrambled to move digital assets from centralized exchanges amid “growing concerns about the solvency of other centralized exchanges,” crypto research firm Delphi Digital wrote in a report this week.  Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin all experienced large deposit drawdowns recently, according to Nansen data. Some smaller platforms, such as AAX, Liquid and lender Salt, have halted withdrawals in the past few days.  ""Users are now a lot more cautious of centralized exchanges after what happened to FTX,"" Martin Lee, data journalist at Nansen, told CoinDesk in a Telegram message. ""Users who had funds on Gemini are withdrawing their funds as a safety measure.""  Multiple exchanges attempted to mitigate widespread fear by sharing or promising to publish their crypto holdings. High-profile industry figures are advocating for presenting proof of reserves and performing independent audits of crypto holdings on a regular basis.

Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), ranking members of the House Financial Services Committee, said that they are planning to hold a bipartisan hearing in December to scrutinize the multibillion-dollar collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX and its ""broader consequences"" for the digital asset space, according to a release dated Wednesday. FTX founder and ex-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried along with his hedge fund, Alameda Research, and rival exchange Binance, which temporarily offered to bail out FTX, are all expected to attend the hearing. “The fall of FTX has posed tremendous harm to over one million users, many of whom were everyday people who invested their hard-earned savings into the FTX cryptocurrency exchange, only to watch it all disappear within a matter of seconds,” Waters said in a statement. “Unfortunately, this event is just one out of many examples of cryptocurrency platforms that have collapsed just this past year.” With many pieces of the FTX-fiasco puzzle still missing, McHenry highlighted that ""we must get to the bottom of this for FTX's customers and the American people,"" referencing Congress' oversight functions.

4327712,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508912,1668639787,"Paolo Ardoino Talks FTX, Adoption And Self-Custody With NewsBTC","What happened here was not a mistake; it is not that they were hacked. They took several decisions to put at risk customer assets. The crypto industry saw dark days over the past week. FTX, the former second-largest exchange in the world, crumbled. The fallout continues to ripple across the industry, with FTX-backed companies filing for bankruptcy, users filing for lawsuits, and regulators sharpening their claws. Related Reading: Tom Brady, Gisele Bundchen And Sam Bankman-Fried Sued Over FTX Collapse In this context, we sat with Paolo Ardoino, Chief Technical Officer (CTO) for Tether and crypto exchange Bitfinex to get his opinion about recent events. Paolo joined us from El Salvador, the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender, a historical place for the nascent asset class. Two major events in the industry’s history came together from this location, the celebration of mainstream adoption by a nation-state and the fall from grace of one of its golden boys, Sam Bankman-Fried. Paolo gave his perspective on real adoption in the Latin American Country, and the recent events that ushered in the collapse of FTX. His message revolved around education, self-custody, and the work ahead for crypto exchanges, users, and all actors across the crypto space. This is what he told us: Q: You were on the ground in El Savador, the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender. Are people using Bitcoin for daily payments? How do you see things down there in terms of adoption? PA: So adoption, you know, so we see adoption in among, first of all, commercials, and businesses. The adoption when it comes to people and retail, the consumers, is still not widespread. I think it’s normal. So is fully normal, you know, thinking and pretending that after just one year, everyone in the streets would use Bitcoin. That is super far-fetched. The usage of Bitcoin comes with infrastructure, and building infrastructure requires time, even when Europe moved from, you know, all the different currencies of the different countries to one single currency called Euro. It took several years up to six years to prepare everyone for the passage. And that was, you know, a forced passage to a single option that was Europe and is in El Salvador. Bitcoin is being used as an option for dollars. So, my point is that it will take several years in order to create adoption, and that is completely normal. And the only thing we can do is to keep building infrastructure and support and make the user experience more seamless. Q: How are you guys contributing to crypto adoption? PA: First, we have supported different educational platforms like “Mi Primer Bitcoin.” We are working directly with the government to try to set up courses at different levels from universities and high schools for Bitcoin education, right? We cannot pretend that adoption will happen by itself, it will happen only when people understand why Bitcoin matters. We at BitFinex are devoting resources. Well, of course, we devoted resources when it came to, you know, helping the families affected by the Pandemic or by the hurricane, but that is just the first step. The important part is starting with all the educational projects that we have, and so also we are kind of excited because more and more with all the different things that will happen in the next months. El Salvador will stay on the map and we will become more prominent because there is also a securities law (to be introduced) that will enable companies to raise capital and create a securities tokens like you know, issue bonds issue or stocks and raise capital through Bitcoin. So more and more so. The infrastructure has to be at all levels, it cannot be just retail, it cannot just be consumer, it cannot just be shops, (there has to be) a full immersion of Bitcoin as a payment option as a capital raise option for companies here. Q: Do you believe the last week, with FTX collapsing, users losing millions on the platforms, and regulators coming after the industry, will change anything for crypto adoption? PA: Well, I think that the last week just showed that there is a big difference between Bitcoin and everything else. We have seen an exchange that actually devoted itself to altcoins with some debatable approaches to the point where they were actually managing these tokens to go bankrupt. The sad, sad story is that many people had bitcoins on those exchange and that exchange, and they thought they had Bitcoins on that exchange, but now they realize they don’t have any more Bitcoins. It shows the (importance) of holding your bitcoins in your private wallet, right? So, not everyone can do that yet, right? Because there is some user experience challenges because no one is comfortable, and not everyone is comfortable to store its own bitcoins privately, but I think that what happened is making more and more the case of for companies to research in building applications that can help the self custody of Bitcoins. And again, as I said, (the FTX collapse) also showed the difference between Bitcoin as more reliable, more secure, un-censorable money network and the rest. The industry will learn that you know, you cannot lend out other people’s money. You cannot use other people’s money to buy stuff. And so on. What happened here was not a mistake, it is not that they were hacked. They took several decisions to put at risk customer assets. Q: What do you think will come out of this debacle, if anything? The industry likes to believe that it learned something from FTX’s mistakes, how do you spot another future Sam Bankman-Fried as a bad actor? First of all, if something is too good to be true, that is already a problem, right? I mean, these guys were offering you know, things that all the other exchanges were not offering to grow faster, but you know, in the end really, it was too good to be true. I think that FTX was always vocal against proof of work, and it was vocal against the usage of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, for decentralized finance (DeFi) or for interactions without intermediaries. So, they were quite vocal in working with regulators to increase their grip in our industry, in a sense that created some panic among the industry. We understand that regulations will come and there is some sort of need for it but we are now in a situation where we risk over-regulation. Hence, we’re at risk of crippling the industry, the potential, and the innovation that it can create. Honestly, I’m talking to many people that are extremely pissed by the fact that we took a three years step back. We are at the same situation of the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) era. And we have to put even more effort to regain the trust of the users and educate them on how to properly keep their funds under their own custody. So, really it is a complex process that requires energy that should be better invested in Bitcoin adoption. Yet we have to fight the fight to show that not everyone in the space is the same (as Sam Bankman-Fried). There are bad actors and good actors. Q: Tether was one of the first to freeze FTX funds. How do you work with authorities to make that decision? Were there any red signals about FTX, Sam, and Alameda before their collapse influencing the decision? PA: We (Tether) received a law enforcement request. You might have seen later on also the SCB, the security commission of Bahamas, issued a statement that was connected to our freezing process. We get contacted by law enforcement and we have to act, keep in mind that Tether is a centralized stablecoin. Because although it uses the decentralized transport layer is a centralized stablecoin. We have to comply with the requirements of law enforcement. And honestly, I was pleased that we were extremely quick to act to save a little bit of money of users. Because, you know, after they went bankrupt they were also hacked. So, it’s putting oil on the fire. Q: In the wake of FTX, there are reports about massive crypto withdrawals from exchanges; Bloomberg reported over $3 billion in the past week alone. Is Bitfinex prepared to deal with a bank run? And in that sense, will the FTX incident force all major exchanges to adopt some proof of reserve mechanism and become more accountable to users? PA: Absolutely. So with BitFinex, we released the proof of reserves that shows that BitFinex has around $7.5 to $8 billion in custody on the platform. So that, you know, for us is important to show to the jury. Just let me take a step back of those assets. The majority is in Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is not some sort of vaporware coins that you create. So that to us is quite important because shows that BitFinex probably has the second biggest wallet in the world. We have the funds that we are supposed to have under our custody. We showed the proof of reserves and also we published or republished a project that we have been working for some time. Called “Antani”, it is an open source library that allows us to publish a proof of liabilities, because with proof of reserves, you don’t have the full picture. You also need the proof of liabilities. But in general, a good message would be that exchanges should teach their users to keep custody of your own tokens on exchanges. 50% of the assets deposited on exchanges, probably more but to be safe, is not used for trading. Exchanges should be used for trading, they should not be your custodians. You should have a Ledger Wallet. You should have a multi-SIG, you should try to do your own setup, and that’s what exchanges should teach. I represent an exchange. And I believe that people should learn more about self-custody. Q: Finally, Paolo, where do you think the industry will be in 2023 and 2033? Was the collapse of FTX, as some called it, part of the industry’s “growing pains”? What changes need to be implemented to take the next step forward in adoption? PA: The industry has to mature. In one way or the other, it will need to mature and I think that the work that we are doing at BitFinex is actually going in that direction; to try to lead the way in this maturing process. We are providing the tools, our mission is to (help) companies and even governments, like what we are doing elsewhere with the traditional financial system right we want to create more options for people and governments to access capital. And we want to reinforce our focus on Bitcoin. Of course, we are an exchange we have to provide options, but in our heart is Bitcoin. We will always keep Bitcoin as our priority. More and more BitFinex will be considered the place to go if you want to you know interact with Bitcoin, learn about Bitcoin, learn about financial inclusions, and to educate yourself.

In addition to losing their jobs at the now-bankrupt exchange, many of FTX’s employees also appear to have significant amounts of personal wealth locked in the platform – wealth that is likely gone after being sucked into the black hole of the FTX disaster.  FTX’s deficit was allegedly created, according to a Wall Street Journal report last week, by former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried’s penchant for playing fast and loose with customer funds, using them to cover the debts of his quant trading firm, Alameda Research, violating the exchange’s own terms and conditions.  Former FTX Head of Marketing Nathaniel Whittemore, who is also a CoinDesk podcaster, said this week that he and the majority of the exchange’s other employees had no idea about the allegedly fraudulent treatment of customer funds. His account rhymes with claims other former employees have made on social media, as well as a CoinDesk report last week that showed Bankman-Fried’s inner circle may have had an unusual level of control over the company.  Read more: Bankman-Fried’s Cabal of Roommates in the Bahamas Ran His Crypto Empire – and Dated. Other Employees Have Lots of Questions.  In an episode of The Breakdown released Monday, Whittemore said that employees were kept in the dark, and that many of them – especially FTX’s non-U.S. staff – used the exchange like a bank, and did not know that their savings had already allegedly been squandered.  “You have to understand just how devastated the average FTX employee was” after Binance’s bailout of FTX fell through, Whittemore said. “Not only, then, did it seem that they might be out of a job, but they were also potentially facing the total loss of their savings.”  Another former employee who asked to remain anonymous seconded Whittemore’s claim, telling CoinDesk that many of FTX’s staff kept the money from their paychecks at the exchange because it was convenient, utilizing FTX’s easy fiat off-ramps to withdraw money when they needed.  Employees’ use of FTX as a bank was encouraged by Bankman-Fried and other higher-ups, according to former employees speaking to CoinDesk on the condition of anonymity.  According to anonymous Twitter account Autism Capital, after FTX bought out Binance’s shares in the company last year, employees were encouraged to invest in FTX.com at a 50% discount, which the company promised to match up to $250,000 – a deal that was allegedly heavily promoted internally. That equity, along with other employee funds (including bonuses sometimes given out in the form of FTT, the exchange’s native token) was then allegedly stored on the FTX platform.  A former employee confirmed the veracity of Autism Capital’s allegations, and provided CoinDesk with a screenshot of an internal spreadsheet that appears to show FTX employees’ holdings as part of a larger list of investments in the platform.  It is currently unclear whether any employees were able to withdraw their funds from the exchange before withdrawals were halted.  If Whittemore’s account on the Breakdown is anything to go off of, the likely answer is “no.”  “For me, all I could feel was rage and white, hot anger as Sam and those around him wouldn’t even give these people the fucking courtesy of a message on Slack to give them any explanation for what they could expect,” Whittemore said.  “It wasn’t just … that Sam and a small group around him perpetrated fraud, which they did,” Whittemore added. “From the moment the fraud was called out and the market started to react, every single ounce of their effort went into self preservation,” he added. “It was callous, cruel and utterly devoid of any genuine human consideration.”  Representatives for both FTX and Bankman-Fried did not return CoinDesk’s requests for comment.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | BNB | FTT,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/16/ftx-employees-were-encouraged-to-keep-life-savings-in-the-now-bankrupt-exchange-sources-say,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ea2ae997d9200747a43d6c82a152756d8952f08-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The lending arm of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading temporarily suspended redemptions and new loan originations, adding to the rapidly widening fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s collapse.  This article originally appeared in Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Interim CEO Derar Islim told customers on a call that Genesis is exploring solutions for the lending unit, including finding a source of fresh liquidity. He said Genesis intends to detail its plan to clients next week.  Genesis Global Capital serves an institutional client base and had $2.8 billion in total active loans as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, according to the company’s website. Genesis owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  Islim added that Genesis’ trading and custody services via Genesis Trading, which acts as Genesis Global Capital’s broker/dealer, remain fully operational. Genesis Trading is independently capitalized and operated from the lending arm, Islim said.  ""Today Genesis Global Capital, Genesis's lending business, made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations. This decision was made in response to the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion,"" said Amanda Cowie, vice president of communications and marketing at DCG.  Genesis’ announcement is the latest entanglement to FTX’s liquidity crisis and subsequent filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week. The industry is already reeling from multiple debacles earlier this year, including the collapse of the terraUSD (UST) stablecoin and the LUNA token that backs it.  But Dr. Anna Becker, CEO and co-founder of alternative investment firm EndoTech, sees the FTX crisis as a potential building block for the industry. “The improper custody of funds and reckless risk management continue to have a devastating impact on innocent consumers. It is totally unacceptable…We urge those who continue to build this industry, as well as the SEC, FDIC and other regulatory bodies to work together in order to ensure the well-being of investors and uproot bad actors from our industry.  Other News  Bitcoin fell about 1.5% over the past 24 hours to trade at about $1,600 as investors considered the latest debacle to afflict the crypto industry. Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,200, off more than 3%. Other major cryptocurrencies were largely in the red with FTX’s FTT token declining more than 14% and Serum’s SRM dropping more than 6%. FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried had been a major supporter of Serum, a decentralized exchange protocol on the Solana blockchain.  Digital asset manager Grayscale Investments sought to reassure investors they will not be affected by Genesis Global Capital suspending withdrawals in the wake of FTX's collapse. Grayscale is a unit of Digital Currency Group, the parent company of Genesis Global Capital and Grayscale. Grayscale announced via Twitter on Wednesday that ""Genesis Global Capital is not a counterparty or service provider for any Grayscale product.""  Crypto investors in the U.S. filed a class-action suit accusing Sam Bankman-Fried and the company’s host of paid celebrity promoters, including NFL quarterback Tom Brady, comedian Larry David, tennis player Naomi Osaka and NBA team the Golden State Warriors, with fraudulently promoting FTX yield-bearing account (YBAs). The plaintiffs called the FTX platform “a house of cards” and “Ponzi scheme... where the FTX Entities shuffled customer funds between their opaque affiliated entities, using new investor funds obtained through investments in the YBAs and loans to pay interest to the old ones and to attempt to maintain the appearance of liquidity.”  Latest Prices  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 839.84 −15.1 ▼ 1.8% Bitcoin (BTC) $16,536 −327.7 ▼ 1.9% Ethereum (ETH) $1,207 −37.9 ▼ 3.0% S&P 500 daily close  3,958.79 −32.9 ▼ 0.8% Gold  $1,777 +3.2 ▲ 0.2% Treasury Yield 10 Years  3.69% ▼ 0.1 BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices; gold is COMEX spot price.

A lack of price movement gives investors less opportunity to generate gains. Now, as investors focus more on avoiding calamity than producing alpha, a new trading range appears to be forming around the $16,500 level for BTC.  Where previously the market saw significant price agreement between the $19,000 to $20,000 range, the recent turmoil has pushed it to a lower level.  Read the full technical take here.

Algorand became FIFA’s official blockchain partner in May. Algorand is a regional supporter of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, for North America and Europe. The blockchain is also an official sponsor of the Women’s World Cup, which begins next year in Australia and New Zealand.  Africa Village  Africa Village is a mini festival bolted onto the FIFA World Cup on the field in Qatar and online. It’s working with the African wing of the United Nations Development Program, plus the Centre for Development Intelligence, to bring African metaverse content to the World Cup.  The in-person component comprises a lounge in Hotel Park and six days of live music. The lounge and associated events function as “an inclusive global event for everyone who is a soccer fan and interested in African culture,” says Hashmel Osuman, the founder of Incredible Spaces, which is managing the online component.  The online part involves selling NFTs featuring African soccer stars. The collection will drop with the launch of the World Cup. Why bring NFTs to the World Cup? It’s simple, Osuman told CoinDesk: “The World Cup is one of the most watched events on the planet,” and eyeballs could mean big business, even for those who can’t travel to Doha.  Budverse x FIFA World Cup  Put on your beer goggles and enter the Budverse, where anyone old enough to buy a drink can mint an NFT updated by the scores of the latest game. The NFT represents the holder’s chosen country and follows the team’s progress throughout the competition. Holders also enter a competition to win tickets to the World Cup finals, plus a football kit. Budweiser developed the World Cup collection in partnership with serial entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk’s Vayner3 Web3 consultancy, and launched it on Oct. 13.  The World Cup NFTs are the latest addition to the Budverse; previous entrants included a collection of heritage beer cans and a “royalty” collection that lets holders support one of 22 Budweiser-sponsored artists. The tracker NFTs cost $100 to mint, although holders of the can collection can mint one of the World Cup tracker NFTs for free.

Bahamas-based lawyer Brian Simms, one of the provisional liquidators appointed by the Bahamas Supreme Court, said in a court filing that FTX was not authorized to file for bankruptcy in the U.S., adding that he “reject[s] the validity of any purported attempt to place FTX affiliates in bankruptcy.”  Simms’ declaration came after he and other liquidators filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection on behalf of the Bahamas arm of the insolvent crypto exchange – FTX Digital Markets – in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on Tuesday. Chapter 15 bankruptcy is typically used in cross-border operations.  Read more: FTX’s Bahamas Arm Files For Bankruptcy Protection in the U.S.  Though Simms did not ask the court to dismiss the U.S. bankruptcy proceedings, he requested that the court recognize the validity of the Bahamian legal actions, which he said could “impact” U.S. proceedings for the other FTX-controlled entities.  That impact, Simms essentially argued in his declaration, boils down to this: FTX Digital Markets was the parent company of the entire FTX empire – and all of that empire’s assets ultimately belong to FTX Digital Markets.  “Despite the seemingly complex structure of the FTX Brand companies, the entire FTX Brand was ultimately operated from a single location: The Bahamas,” Simms wrote in his declaration. “All core management personnel likewise were located in The Bahamas.”  Simms has asked the court for provisional relief including the recognition of Bahamian bankruptcy and liquidation proceedings, and orders entrusting FTX’s assets located in the U.S. to Bahamian liquidators, authorizing “urgent discovery measures,” and preventing any of FTX’s assets to be “transfer[ed], encumber[ed] or otherwise dispose[d] of.”  A hearing to determine next steps is currently slated for Dec. 13.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/16/bahamian-liquidators-say-ftx-wasnt-authorized-to-file-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82f7d7053c6aa418c664d01f4d2a2c988ad38612-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meta Platforms enlists Polygon for Instagram NFTs. Fashion and payments companies add to the recent partnerships. In a recent article , I advised buying Disney for eventual growth in the metaverse. Polygon ( MATIC-USD ) is a crypto project that has been making waves with a series of big-name corporate partnerships, including Disney. The coin would be a good buy after the recent turmoil in the cryptocurrency market. Disney adds Polygon to its accelerator program In my Disney article, I talked about the company’s plans to merge the Disney+ streaming service with its theme parks in the virtual reality world. A recent partnership saw Disney adding the Polygon blockchain to its accelerator program and senior leadership at the entertainment giant will mentor participants. Key to the announcement is that Polygon is a scaling solution and Disney has the brand for scale. Polygon is a decentralized Ethereum-based scaling platform that enables developers to create scalable user-friendly applications with low transaction fees and high security. Over 37,000 decentralized apps have now been built with its suite of products. With its 2022 Accelerator Program, Disney is ramping up its plans for the adoption of Web3 and blockchain technologies. The Accelerator program will work on projects such as NFTs, Augmented Reality, and Artificial Intelligence. Disney’s approach to the metaverse will be leveraging its stories and characters to “develop new technologies and storytelling canvasses to create connected experiences across physical, digital, and virtual worlds”. Meta Platforms adds to the big-name Polygon support Another big news story broke just before the recent carnage in the cryptocurrency market as Meta Platforms ( META ) announced that it would use the Polygon blockchain to let users mint and sell NFTs on the Instagram app. This is the social media platform’s latest Web3 integration amid intense competition with TikTok and Alphabet’s YouTube. “Blockchain has a role in this because it can enable entirely new business models for creators that give them more control over their work and audiences, and how they monetize,” tweeted Stephane Kasriel, Meta’s Head of Commerce and Fintech. “We believe Web3 tech, like blockchain, will positively enhance the economic model for creators by giving them the ability to create new types of digital assets to monetize,” he said. In Disney and Meta Platforms, Polygon has some serious potential for tapping into big user bases. It is still early days for the metaverse and mass adoption of NFTs, but Polygon will remain in demand with other projects and use cases. Yet another social media platform enlisted the help of Polygon’s blockchain as Reddit launched its hugely popular Collectible Avatar NFTs. The first Reddit NFT collection of 40,000 avatars sold out after the creation of 2.5 million Reddit Vault wallets, which exceeds the estimated 2.3 million active users on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace. Polygon has closed around $800 million in all-time sales on OpenSea compared to the $32 billion of Ethereum. Another benefit for MATIC investors is that the project committed $20 million to offset its carbon-dioxide emissions in April this year. Sandeep Nailwal, the project's founder, said more efforts need to be made by blockchain companies to form a “united front” to fund and “leverage technology that helps heal the earth -- rather than destroy it.” That can help to keep the project relevant after previous criticism of the energy-intensive nature of cryptocurrency. Fashion and payments also want a piece of Polygon Two of the world’s best-known fashion brands also collaborated with Polygon Studios to build a new collection on the blockchain. The two brands unveiled the Adidas for Prada re-source project which was with digital artist Zach Lieberman. The ambitious first-of-a-kind collaboration will combine user-generated and creator-owned art. The goal is to create a large-scale digital artwork inspired by the Re-Nylon collection. The two companies will invite their followers to contribute unique photographs to the open-Metaverse NFT project. Three thousand of these community-sourced artworks will be minted as NFTs and added as tiles in a large NFT mosaic designed by Lieberman. In the payments world, Stripe said in April 2022 that it will use Polygon to enable Stripe’s customers to pay sellers, freelancers, creators, and service providers in crypto. The first stage of payouts will be done using USDC stablecoins native to the Polygon blockchain and will be done via Polygon-compatible wallets. Twitter ( TWTR ) announced that it would be the first company to try out the new feature by allowing earnings to be paid out to content creators for users of the company’s monetization products such as “Ticketed Spaces” and “Super Follows.” However, that collaboration may have hit a roadblock with the arrival of Elon Musk after his Twitter acquisition. At the time of writing, Polygon’s MATIC token was trading at $0.92 after a drop from around $1.28 ahead of the FTX exchange fallout. That puts the coin at number 10 in the list of projects by market cap with a valuation of $8 billion. The all-time high in MATIC is near the $2.75 price level. Conclusion Ahead of the recent cryptocurrency market turmoil, the Polygon blockchain was signed up to some big partnerships. Disney wants to use the company's scalable solution for its metaverse entrance, while Meta Platforms is using the project to add NFTs to its Instagram app. We have also seen fashion brands and payments companies use the chain in a growing vote of confidence for the project. Investors looking for a solid cryptocurrency investment should be rewarded in Polygon with the coin currently trading beneath $1.00.",POSITIVE,MATIC,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MATIC | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558537-buy-polygon-for-big-brand-crypto-scaling?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4324045.jpeg

These large-scale investors have been spooked by recent volatility that is difficult to predict and may send their investments spiraling downward. Bitcoin’s support has already fallen about 13% over the past 10 days amid the unraveling of crypto exchange FTX. Its recent price at about $16,500 is less than a quarter of what it was just a year ago.  But this latest twist is odd given investors previous concerns about a lack of volatility that has plagued markets for months.  For both BTC and ETH, the magnitude of price movement since January 2022 has been declining, when using the Average True Range of daily price movement as a proxy.  A lack of price movement, gives investors less opportunity to generate gains.  Now as investors focus more on avoiding calamity than producing alpha, a new trading range appears to be forming at the $16,500 level for BTC.  Where previously we saw significant price agreement between the $19,000 to $20,000 range, the recent turmoil has pushed that level of agreement down.  For ETH, the spikes in price agreement are appearing at both the $1,200 and $1,100 level.  Institutional investors appear to still have confidence about digital assets, but also find little reason to add exposure.  “Right now, most of the institutional investors we talk to are content to sit on the sidelines and just wait...they haven't sworn off the space, but they're not doing anything in crypto right now especially against this macro backdrop,” Ben McMillan, CIO of digital currency index provider IDX Digital Assets said  McMillan said that investors are anxious about future developments that could send crypto markets further spiraling.  “I think there's no question investors are waiting for the next shoe to drop...the million dollar question is ""how big is that shoe?"" he said.  He added: “I've had several calls already today about Genesis halting withdrawals. That's not to say there's anywhere near the risk there that existed with FTX but investors are very skittish about ANY counterparty risk in crypto right now and the bias is to ""get out first and re-assess later.""",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/16/have-crypto-markets-reached-bottom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/625dcd4e50bd279bffd1fc013d5f5fe4f5c8f01f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42421417,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoD6r,1668629152,What Will It Look Like When Taxation and Privacy Collide?,"Web3 is at the beginning of a privacy boom. Old-guard privacy solutions like Zcash and Tornado Cash demonstrated the opportunities for privacy protocols, but today’s wave of new layer 1 and layer 2 networks bring expressive computation and complex smart contract capabilities to private networks.  The result of this emerging ecosystem will be a future where all sorts of on-chain activities – financial, creative, data, and operational – will occur obfuscated behind privacy layers. Individuals and entities will grow familiar and comfortable with trustless, private interaction secured by zero-knowledge technologies.  Matthew Niemerg is the co-founder of Aleph Zero. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  When taxes and privacy collide  When we imagine the future of web3 and privacy, it might be difficult to fit taxation neatly into the picture. At face value, private financial activity seems antithetical to taxation, which today requires transparency by regulators for authentication. Privacy and taxation as contradictory to one another is founded in some reality. Funds that have been exploited from DeFi applications are frequently sent through mixers on private networks that render those funds – and thus their taxable implications – untraceable.  With this narrative stuck in our minds, it’s easy for us to default to a vision of the future where privacy and taxation remain combative. A future made up of two opposing forces: web3 users hiding their taxable events versus lawmakers rushing to catch up and penalizing culprits.  See also: Key Tax Implications of NFTs, Crypto Staking and Yield Farming | Opinion  But what if there was another way to look at the inevitable collision of taxes and privacy networks? What if instead of private protocols enabling tax avoidance or evasion, privacy in web3 actually enhanced tax reporting, resulting in a “best of both worlds” solution for both individuals and regulators?  Zero-knowledge taxes  “Zero-knowledge taxes” describes a situation in which taxes can be filed and verified with zero-knowledge proofs. This could operate through a trusted, third party application that analyzes a user’s wallets and calculates taxable events, resulting in a net summary of the individual’s taxes for the year. That summary tax payment, along with the proof itself, is submitted to the regulating entity, which can verify through the proof that the tax summary is accurate without needing to see every transaction leading up to the summary.  Many privacy protocols today are built with selective privacy, meaning users can elect to reveal certain portions of their on-chain history if they wish. This could be another mechanism to establish trust between the tax filer and the regulator. Should a regulator body have reason to distrust a submitted zero-knowledge tax proof, they could compel the filer to reveal contested portions of their transaction history. Though difficult to enforce on an individual level – presuming there will be a variety of selective and non-selective privacy networks available – a government requirement for all businesses to use a selective privacy network, for example, could be an effective way to manage corporate taxes.  Zero-knowledge taxes, which are just in the conceptual phase, are not a panacea for the challenges that will arise around crypto taxes in the future for both individuals and regulators. However, they do offer a vision for how Web3 innovation can be used to the mutual benefit of both its users and its regulators.  The elephant in the room: outlawing privacy  The world is no stranger to sudden measures by governments to restrict crypto, typically in the name of consumer protection or fraud prevention. For the privacy ecosystem, the significant example is the United States, which recently sanctioned every address that has interacted with Tornado Cash.  With a precedent like this in the books, the vision painted above of the symbiosis between taxes and blockchain privacy may seem particularly unlikely. However, Tornado Cash is distinct from the zero-knowledge protocols emerging today – and therefore so are the implications of future sanctions.  When the U.S. government sanctioned Tornado Cash, what they wished to sanction was the untraceable, unverifiable movement of funds. The private nature of Tornado Cash wouldn’t allow the U.S. government to sanction addresses that only transferred funds (as opposed to other on-chain actions). But, luckily for those regulators, they didn’t have to worry about this. Tornado Cash is a straightforward protocol that allows only for the transfer of funds. By sanctioning the protocol, the U.S. government was able to sanction the undesired action.  This approach will not translate to the emerging wave of more expressive privacy networks, which can enable anything from transferring funds to sending messages. Unable to select and sanction specific actions behind a privacy wall, regulators will be faced with a choice: sanction an entire protocol, including all the benign non-financial activity, or adapt and learn how to regulate privacy networks to create a symbiotic relationship between regulator and individual.  Read more: Tax and Compliance Challenges Enterprises Face in Crypto | Opinion  A world where tax filers and regulators happily and trustlessly interact with zero-knowledge technology is not right around the corner. Not only does a considerable amount of work need to happen in the Web3 privacy space, but lawmakers need to warm up to the crypto industry as a whole, let alone more esoteric and technical niches like zero-knowledge.  However, just like death and taxes, privacy technology, too, is inevitable. The evolution of Web3 will weave in more privacy solutions, and both users and regulators will be forced to contend with the technology eventually.

42421431,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDML,1668629050,Taxes and Music NFTs: A Match Made in Hell?,"Nearly every human who has ever paid a check, received a check, or waited in line at the Post Office on tax day has inevitably experienced some inner gloom regarding a certain five-lettered word: taxes. Throughout much of history, taxes have simply been a way of life. We work, play and live, and then some sort of shadowy figure (probably in a suit) takes a [insert percentage] piece of the pie.  But what about crypto, you ask? Even in such a volatile, often unregulated and always chaotic ecosystem, we still must pay taxes! Like nearly all other industries, you are required to pay a percentage of your short-term and long-term capital gains, put against how long you have held assets and your income. And guess what? The same goes for NFTs too! Degens – can I get a whatthehellelujah?!  Let me explain.  Sidney Swift is founder and CEO of Defient. He leads Rolling Stone’s Web3 Culture Council. This piece is part of CoinDesk's tax week.  NFTs, meet the taxman  Okay, first things first. The basics. Creating (a.k.a. minting) an NFT is not a taxable event. If you create an NFT (a 1:1 or a 10K-strong collection) and no one buys it or trades it, you will not be taxed. So you can rest assured that your decision to tokenize your college diploma will not affect your finances any more than your college education did. Phew! According to Uncle Sam, in the United States, any crypto-to-crypto transaction is a taxable event, including buying an NFT, trading an NFT, or selling an NFT. A handy blog from TokenTax breaks down how any gains you make on NFT trades or sales will be taxed just like any gains on your bitcoin or ether, for example. Pretty straightforward, right? Well, not necessarily. This is crypto we’re talking about, people!  Coinbase explains just how confusing tax laws around NFTs can be. The IRS considers NFT transactions as two-part events, the first being the sale of the crypto you used to buy an NFT (and how much its value rose since the time you purchased it – i.e., 1 ETH from $1,000 to $4,000; ah, the good old days) and the second being any gains from the sale of said NFT. Furthermore, the IRS’ exact guidelines over what is considered a work of art (i.e., a 28% capital gains tax) are somewhat unclear. What about royalties, a buzzword of the moment in NFTs? Any royalties received via NFT sales are still taxed just like income, based on your tax bracket.  See also: Key Tax Implications of NFTs, Crypto Staking and Yield Farming | Opinion  So we understand a bit of what taxes mean for NFTs, where many might initially think about digital collectibles, art, and PFPs, but what about music – and, more specifically, music NFTs?  Music, meet NFTs  Taxation around “traditional” recorded music can also be a tad murky. The IRS splits the potential for taxation on whether you categorize your music-making as a hobby or business. Additionally, if you find yourself in a band or duo, you will have to figure out who will file a return. Self-employed musicians and their creative accounts also have an opportunity to write off everything from a guitar case to internet bills. Regardless, musicians are taxed on capital gains, income and royalties.  So what does this mean for the still fresh-faced world of Web3 music, a burgeoning space of the ecosystem categorized primarily by music NFTs (a broad-ish term for tokenized songs and albums, music-focused NFT memberships, music memorabilia, and collectibles) but also things like music DAOs, decentralized labels, and avatar artists? An article in Billboard covers how musicians can legally protect themselves in Web3, especially when you start hearing words like “securities,” “copyrights” and “royalties.”  The web3 music ecosystem is vast. You have royalties-focused platforms (Royal), streaming-focused platforms (Audius), collection/drops-focused platforms (Sound.xyz), DAOs (Friends with Benefits), decentralized music clubs and avatar artist projects (ChillRX), open protocols (Zora, Decent.xyz), artist tools (OxSplits) and even major labels (Warner, Death Row). The primary purpose of all these operations is to introduce music-making and music-consumption tools into Web3 communities to create alternative revenue streams for artists and fans who show their loyalty through investing in artists. Now, if you reread this last paragraph and this entire article, you should be thinking: What does this mean for the relationship between music NFTs and taxes?  Read more: Tax and Compliance Challenges Enterprises Face in Crypto | Opinion  Taxman, meet music NFTs  If laws around taxation are confusing for crypto and art-focused NFTs, music is a whole other can of worms. Platforms like the 3LAU-founded Royal pay streaming royalties to fans who invest in music NFTs from artists ranging from superstars (Diplo) to indie artists (Vérité). When streaming checks hit and are split between artists and labels/publishers, a percentage is then paid out to investors of the artist’s NFTs. Royal’s T&C page outlines that, yes, you are responsible for reporting any gains around your trades or sales. What’s less clear is how that differentiates around the fluctuation of the currency you bought the NFT with and whether you are taxed on the royalties payout you receive and/or your profit from a potential NFT sale. Likely, the answer is both.  What do artists who mint music NFTs get to write off? How do their label and streaming contracts come into play when setting royalty rates and paying out collectors? When a virtual artist, who could be actually multiple producers, releases a track as an NFT and on Spotify, who is taxed and when? How are members of music DAOs taxed on the value of membership tokens and collective investments, like music catalogs, which are strictly tied to royalties and various tax laws? Is it all the same as regular crypto? I believe all of these questions are far too unclear and need answering.  Here’s why:  A lack of clarity around taxation in Web3 music could harm artists or simply prevent them from entering the space. The same goes for collectors and fans.  We hear a lot of chatter around taxes in crypto and collectible NFTs but little about music NFTs. Let’s change this. In Web3, transparency is key!  In Web3 music, communities invest in artists, who then provide value to their communities through rewards and access. How this flywheel relates to taxation is still being determined.  Regulation and tax law in crypto are evolving. Web3 music needs to be ready for what’s coming.  Taxes are something no one really ever wants to talk about, and this is especially true in Web3. For decades, classes have been taught and books have been written about the inner-workings of the music business. The world’s top music lawyers are industry icons who get profiled in year-end lists. If web music is truly going to change the world and bring power back to artists and the communities who support them, we can no longer avoid the inevitable growing elephant in the room.",NEUTRAL,ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,Sidney Swift,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/16/music-nft-taxation-guide,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/568eeaaf97796ae3c21e60b5a7e3128a07893ea3-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Polygon (MATIC) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news broke that Binance would not be taking over FTX and the company had gone bankrupt. Previous months saw the price of most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed.

The current market uncertainty has caused traders and investors to be hesitant to purchase altcoins, as there is no guarantee that they will rise in value any time soon. The news of other exchanges being in the mix of the FTX saga has raised more fears as many investors and traders shy away from investing in some projects; this can not be said of MATIC, as many investors and traders continue to show so much interest in this project. MATIC’s price declined to a weekly low of $0.77 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $0.97 as the price aims to break higher. The price of MATIC needs to be above $0.75 to avoid going to a lower region. Weekly resistance for the price of MATIC – $1. Weekly support for the price of MATIC – $0.75. Price Analysis Of MATIC On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of MATIC remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $0.8 support after bouncing off from the region of $0.95. If the price of MATIC breaks above $1, we could see more rallies for MATIC price; a break below a region of $0.75 would lead to more sell-offs for MATIC with a possibility of price trending to a region of $0.6. Daily resistance for the MATIC price – $1. Daily support for the MATIC price – $0.75.

As a result, many firms have announced a potential financial crisis if their funds remain unrecovered. Several Users are in a panic due to their funds. However, the latest report revealed that Cherokee Acquisition, a distressed asset investment firm, has given users options to sell their credit claims.

The guide price is between 8 to 12 cents on every dollar of the deposit claims. This is an option for FTX’s creditors who cannot wait till the full resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings to recover their assets. Low Price indicates A Low Probability Of Retrieving User Credit Claims When a firm files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, impatient creditors may sell their credit claims to distressed asset investment companies like Cherokee Acquisition. The distressed assets investment funds place value on the credit claims so that while the creditors can recover parts of their assets, they too can make a profit after redeeming the allegations. However, Cherokee Acquisition’s guide price for the FTX credit claims is relatively low compared to what other bankrupt companies’ users may get. It suggests an almost zero probability for users to retrieve their funds. Celsius Network’s Earn account holders may receive about 20 cents on a dollar after selling their claims. Voyager Digital’s creditors may also get 40 cents on a dollar for their credit claims. Thomas Braziel, the managing partner at 507 Capital, a distressed corporate specialist firm, commented on the meager price tag of FTX’s credit claims. However, he said the price might be too high for potential buyers. According to Braziel, no one is buying the FTX credit claims at that price. Braziel highlighted that the best market price for the deposit claims to be between 3 and 5 cents.

42414906,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBUB8t,1668627682,"Crypto Market Slides After Genesis Withdrawal Halt, but Big Investors May Hunt for Bargains","Digital assets extended losses on Wednesday after the crypto financial firm Genesis Global Capital announced that it was temporarily suspending redemptions and new loan originations, the latest industry player to struggle in wake of crypto exchange FTX's meltdown.  Bitcoin (BTC) dropped 3.5% to $16,456 during U.S. morning trading hours on Wednesday, according to CoinDesk data, erasing some of the prior day’s gains. At press time, bitcoin was changing hands at $16,473.  The cryptocurrency also appeared buffeted by an economic data release showing that U.S. retail sales rose 1.3% in October, a sign that consumers are resilient going into the holiday season. That might mean the Federal Reserve will maintain its aggressive campaign to tamp down economic activity to combat inflation – typically a negative factor for risky assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies.  “We don’t expect any sharp drops or selling pressure due to contagion fears alone since the bulk of the move is likely to be priced in already,” said Joe DiPasquale, CEO of BitBull Capital, a firm that manages crypto hedge funds. “At this point, any new development will result in temporary drops, but we don’t expect investors to be shocked by more FTX-related ramifications either. That being said, recovery from these lows may need time, both in terms of market capitalization and general sentiment.”  Will Tamplin, a senior analyst at technical research firm Fairlead Strategies, said that if bitcoin can’t get back above its long-term support near $18,300 by Sunday’s weekly close, “a major breakdown would be confirmed in a bearish message from the market, which would increase risk to next support near $13,900.”  Altcoins struggle along with bitcoin  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), which measures the performance of 162 major digital assets, lost about 1.8% over the past 24 hours.  Smart-contracts platform Solana’s native SOL token slid 0.2% to around $14 after the Solana Foundation confirmed in a blog Wednesday that FTX entities are in control of around 50 million SOL tokens.  The blog said the tokens were sold from Solana Foundation to FTX and Alameda Research in three transactions between August 2020 and January 2021. The second and third transactions had a linear monthly unlock mechanism, meaning that as the SOL token tranches are to be paid out evenly once a month to FTX, the entities could gradually gain access to millions of tokens up until January 2028.  Aptos, the new layer 1 blockchain established by former employees of Facebook parent Meta Platforms, was one of the few winners Wednesday. The APT token was up 11% to $4.70 in recent trading.  Interest from institutional investors  While FTX’s collapse and its ramifications for the broader crypto industry are a serious blow, it won’t scare away institutional investment from entering the market, according to Sheraz Ahmed, managing partner of Storm Partners.  “General speculation and panic will continue,” Ahmed told CoinDesk, but he said that institutional investors’ “choices are more likely to be informed by how innovation and technology could benefit them.""  “They will most likely rethink their short-term strategies as the market infrastructure remains unstable.”  Once all the stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the fall of FTX absorb the losses, “we could see institutions swoop in at the lows with their heavy pockets,” he added.",NEGATIVE,BTC | SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,"Helene Braun, Jocelyn Yang",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/16/crypto-assets-decline-following-genesis-suspension-wont-scare-away-institutional-investors,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e6afcad09c986fdf44b3016a45df8479944f265-840x428.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42414893,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBUA1u,1668626671,These Crypto Market Makers Were Wary of FTX Before Collapse,"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX has inflicted losses far and wide in the industry. The surrounding market turbulence has crypto lender BlockFi reportedly eyeing bankruptcy protection and the lending arm of Genesis Global Trading – owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group – pausing redemptions and new loans. The debacle has also stoked some pejorative aspersions of crypto as a den of heedless risk taking.  A few big trading firms saw the FTX trouble brewing and took quick action or stuck to risk-mitigation procedures to quickly reduce their exposure amid the throes of the exchange’s collapse. The takeaway might be that the nascent crypto industry does include some savvy players with long-term survival practices that could keep liquidity pools filled, providing a degree of stability during one of the largest shakeouts in the industry’s 13-year history.  Trading firm B2C2 says it turned down an FTX-related loan request. Kairon Labs pulled assets from FTX on a hunch before the exchange imploded. And Amber Group softened its exposure during the withdrawal pause.  “We didn’t really look into it too much, but withdrew 98% of our company’s assets that were on FTX as a precaution, which turned out to be a good move,” Kairon Labs co-founder and managing partner Jens Willemen told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.  FTX collapse: A market maker story  The implosion of FTX started with a CoinDesk report that fueled insolvency concerns and a withdrawn buyout offer from rival Binance and that led to a withdrawal pause. The exchange giant then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  The fallout put a spotlight on a key crypto entity known as the market maker – essentially trading firms that use their own capital to make bets on tokens and take the other side of trades on exchanges when other players are trying to get in or out quickly.  FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried himself has roots in the business: He got his start at Jane Street, a quantitative trading firm and liquidity provider that has a foothold in the crypto industry. He then founded Alameda Research, the trading firm and major market maker that triggered the liquidity crisis.  Early warning signs  B2C2, which announced a CEO change on Friday and offered to purchase loans from Genesis’ books on Wednesday, was approached by FTX sister firm Alameda Research for lending earlier this year, according to a source familiar with the matter. B2C2 declined the offer for unspecified reasons.  B2C2 co-founder and director Max Boonen recently tweeted that he suspected Alameda Research was behind an attempted attack in 2019 on exchange Binance’s then-new futures platform. Binance had a data leak that year that revealed customers' private orders, which the attacker used to set up a strategy of selling large quantities while simultaneously placing bids 30% below.  Boonen alleges now that he suspected then the attacker was Alameda, linked to supporting data, and said that was why he avoided working with the firm over the years.  Alameda didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.  B2C2 didn’t have direct exposure to FTX’s native FTT token or Alameda at the time of the collapse, but had up to $9 million in assets on FTX as a “secondary trading venue,” said a spokesperson – an amount within B2C2’s “established single-exchange risk tolerance” and small enough to have no meaningful impact on operations.  Belgium-based market maker Kairon Labs heard about a month ago that FTX/Alameda was “secretly blowing up,” Willemen told CoinDesk. The information came to the firm from a close contact at a top Asian exchange. Despite not having concrete evidence, Kairon Labs decided to act.  Willemen declined to provide a specific figure, but confirmed the amount Kairon Labs pulled from FTX was in the seven figures.  Caught exposed  Amber Group, another market maker, tweeted on Nov. 9 that the firm had no exposure to Alameda Research or FTX’s native FTT token, but had been an active participant on the exchange.  “While we have significantly reduced our exposure over the course of the week, we still have withdrawals that have yet to be processed,” the firm wrote at the time of the withdrawal pause, noting that the stuck assets represented less than 10% of Amber Group’s total trading capital.  Trading firm Wintermute tweeted Nov. 9 that it had reduced its exposure to FTX after the insolvency concerns started. During the withdrawal pause, some of its funds were stuck, but the amount was “within our risk tolerances and does not have a significant impact on our overall financial position,” Wintermute said.  Two days later, Wintermute said it had stopped trading and market-making operations and moved all of its assets from FTX US, a separate legal entity from the main FTX exchange.  The most recent update came from Cumberland, one of the earliest and longest-standing crypto market makers, which disclosed last week that it had less than $10 million in FTX exposure and no exposure to Alameda. The firm tweeted on Wednesday that its team was working “24/7 to provide liquidity and we are actively quoting across the market.”  Read more: Jefferies CEO Expressed Doubts About Sam Bankman-Fried in July",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | BNB,Brandy Betz,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/16/market-makers-were-wary-of-ftx-before-collapse,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/352f1b0593a05f826e60c13f2764e1769dcdc6e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Whale Transfers $135 Million In XRP Out Of Crypto Exchange Binance As per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a huge XRP transfer was spotted earlier in the day. The transaction amounted to a total of 350,000,000 XRP, and was worth around $134.8 million at the time of the transfer. At the current exchange rate, this stack of coins converts to about $130 million. Such massive transactions usually belong to either a single whale, or an entity made up of multiple investors. So, why was this large transfer done? Here’s some additional details about the transfer that may be revealing about the intent behind the transaction: The complete details of the massive 350k coins transfer | Source: Whale Alert As you can see above, the sender address in this case was a wallet belonging to the crypto exchange Binance. The destination of the transfer was an unknown wallet. Such wallets are likely to be personal addresses, or at the very least aren’t part of any central exchange or other crypto platform. This transaction is an example of an “exchange outflow,” since the XRP exited the exchange supply here. Similarly, the opposite type of transfer is called an “exchange inflow” Generally, large inflows from whales are bearish for the price of the crypto since investors usually deposit to exchanges for selling purposes. Related Reading: This Indicator Hints US Investors Sold Bitcoin Harder Than Others During Crash However, on the contrary, exchange outflows could suggest investors don’t want to sell anytime soon and are thus transferring the coins to hold onto them in personal wallets. Such a large outflow like today’s could therefore imply the whale might have made the transaction to accumulate the crypto. Though, in the current market environment where contagion due to the crypto exchange FTX’s collapse is spreading around, investors are more wary than ever about exchanges. A large amount of holders have been taking the coins off to personal wallets, the keys to which they themselves own. Related Reading: When will Ripple reach the bottom?

42414899,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBUAd3,1668624077,US Sen. Gillibrand Says a Last-Ditch Stablecoin Bill May Still Emerge This Year,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) said the latest effort on a stablecoin regulatory bill is coming soon, and she hopes it can get some attention before Congress transitions into its new session next year.  She’s working with Republican Senators Patrick Toomey (Pa.) and Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.) on “unique” legislation that will establish U.S. rules of the road for the tokens, she said Wednesday.  “This bill we’re working on now – and we hope to introduce it in the next few weeks – would be a comprehensive stablecoin bill that we would ask to at least get a hearing in [the Senate Banking Committee] and maybe get a vote by the end of the Congress,” she said at a Blockchain Association policy event in Washington. Gillibrand and Lummis were the authors of one of the most prominent digital assets oversight bills this year, and this would represent a small piece of that larger effort.  Stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle Internet Financial’s USDC are typically tied to steady assets such as the dollar, and they occupy a central role in the cryptocurrency industry. U.S. lawmakers have widely agreed that this sector may be one they can get an initial handle on while still working on wider industry oversight.  So far, most of the attention has been on a bipartisan legislative effort in the House Financial Services Committee, though it hasn’t yet emerged as a full-fledged bill. And any further efforts this year in either chamber are increasingly unlikely as they compete in a busy lame-duck session. If the efforts of Gillibrand, Lummis and Toomey fail to find traction, they may influence whatever legislation emerges next year.  Getting a crypto bill through the Banking Committee could also run into heavy suspicion from the panel’s chairman, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who this week said that cryptocurrencies still don’t offer “anything useful or beneficial.” Republicans had hoped to replace Brown and other Democratic committee chairs in the election this month, but the Democrats maintained a narrow majority.  Earlier on Wednesday, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire wrote a public letter to Brown, Toomey, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Financial Services Committee, and Rep.

42414908,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBUBEC,1668623727,"Newly Elected US House Whip Emmer Downplays FTX Meltdown, Cheers Crypto","Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who Republicans have picked for a key leadership role in the next Congress, dismissed policymakers’ crypto anxiety after the dramatic collapse of global crypto pillar FTX and said coming up with digital assets legislation next year “could be a lot of fun.”  “We need to use the stage that is Congress to promote all of you beyond the walls of the Capitol,” Emmer said Wednesday at a Blockchain Association event in Washington. “People need to understand more out there that they shouldn’t be afraid of this.”  Emmer, elected as the incoming whip who will organize Republican members of the House for legislative votes, cautioned against making too much of the situation with FTX, whose contagion has been knocking down dominoes of other significant crypto firms since the news of its failure last week.  ""This actually might be a failure of character,” Emmer said. “It's very disappointing to me. The guy, he tweeted out that he really F-ed up – I think that's an admission on its face,” he said in reference to the comments of former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried.  ""You are here to stay,” he said, addressing the crypto policy crowd. “You are going to continue to grow. This incident might have put everybody back a certain amount. We'll see.""  Anyway, Emmer concluded: “You do not get growth without taking risk.”  He said do-gooders shouldn’t be allowed to “rush in and put a huge wet blanket of regulation atop this industry just because something didn't go right.”  Emmer is a member of the House Financial Services Committee, which – in the event the Republicans’ majority is ultimately decided as this month’s election tallies are completed – may be led by a new chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) Emmer said the bipartisan work on crypto policy there – seen this year in negotiations over a stablecoin bill – should be seen as an example by the rest of Congress.  Crypto advocates in Washington routinely maintain that crypto policy is a non-partisan issue that can move forward even in a divided Congress. However, this week’s rhetoric from Democrats such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has painted a harsh picture of crypto suspicion. And many Republicans have been defending the industry, arguing to separate the actions of FTX from the crypto technology underpinning the business.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Jesse Hamilton,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/16/newly-elected-us-house-whip-emmer-downplays-ftx-meltdown-cheers-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0c252b0d51320f3c6ddd9873cef9609e636b717f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

FTX, a crypto exchange that was founded and led by entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, has put regulators in a tough spot, partly because of Bankman-Fried's close relationship with lawmakers, Braganca said.  “Look at how much work SBF was doing to get someone to step up and get regulation done, and now it’s all fallen through,” she said.  Braganca added that lawmakers aren't equipped to “just figure this all out on their own” and need experts and agencies they can trust.  FTX filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. last week following a series of events that started with a CoinDesk report about the balance sheet of its sister company, Alameda Research, and the firm now faces a federal investigation, creating a “bigger mess” for forming new regulation, Braganca said.  “It created all kinds of obstacles to regulation,” she said.

42421424,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDF7,1668622841,The FTX Collapse Looks an Awful Lot Like Enron,"The corpses of FTX and Alameda Research are barely cold, but financial coroners are already deploying scalpels and bone saws to try and figure out what went wrong. These autopsies are far from complete, but the findings so far suggest deep parallels between the Alameda and FTX blowup and the most infamous business fraud in American history – the Texas-based energy trading con Enron (ENE).  Those parallels are extensive and nuanced, even apart from the strange twist that Enron's former lawyer is the new CEO of FTX. But one core similarity is the role of publicly-traded, equity-like assets ultimately linked to the performance of the firms themselves. In both cases, these internal assets flowed between entities that were nominally or even legally separate, but that in fact served the same masters. This enabled egregious financial self-dealing in the form of balance sheets pumped up by fictional valuations, a very fragile form of bootstrap leverage that unwound rapidly as soon as the falsely-inflated assets began to waver.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  FTX’s FTT token appears to have been the largest linchpin of Sam Bankman-Fried’s house of cards. The token was nominally intended to give FTX users a discount on trading fees. But in practice its market price reflected sentiment about the performance of FTX itself, much as a stock tracks the performance of a public company. CoinDesk’s Ian Allison reported on Nov. 2 that a huge portion of Alameda Research’s balance sheet consisted of the FTT token, including some valued at its public price, and locked positions valued at half of that.  This raised alarms for a number of reasons, including by undermining the (already tenuous) idea that FTX and Alameda Research were truly separate operations. It remains unclear how exactly Alameda wound up with the FTT in the first place, but one theory is that the fund participated in the initial sale of FTT. If FTX and Alameda operated in tandem, which seems increasingly clear, this could be considered fraudulent price manipulation.  The findings were also concerning because the FTT tokens were accounted for at prices much higher than they likely could have actually fetched on the open market. Alameda reportedly held half of all existing FTT, a position that would have been impossible to liquidate without tanking the price. This became clear when rival exchange Binance began selling its own FTT stake in reaction to CoinDesk’s reporting, immediately triggering a 75% collapse in the token’s price.  As my colleague Tracy Wang noted last night in a Twitter Spaces event, FTT was not the only asset on FTX or Alameda’s balance sheets subject to similar dynamics. Both entities also held large illiquid stakes in tokenized projects either launched or heavily backed by FTX or Bankman-Fried, including SRM (Serum), MAPS (Maps.me), OXY (Oxygen Network) and FIDA (Bonfida). By providing initial funding, FTX would have played a major role in setting the initial value of these projects’ tokens. Moreover, there is strong evidence that these were, like Alameda itself, not truly independent projects at all.  See also: 4 Key Takeaways from the FTX Fiasco | Opinion  That would mean the value of any of those tokens reflected on Alameda or FTX’s balance sheets were effectively fictional. Very, very fictional: a leaked FTX balance sheet claimed holdings of SRM worth $2 billion dollars, when the entire market value of the token was $88 million.  MAPS, OXY, FIDA and … Blockbuster?  These dynamics are damningly similar to at least two methods by which Enron artificially inflated its stock price: the use of spinoff entities to hide debt, and the use of mark-to-market accounting to claim revenues that didn’t exist.  The most prominent of the spinoff gambits was Chewco, a supposedly independent investment firm created to buy out the California state pension fund CalPERS’ position in a prior partnership with Enron called JEDI. That project had failed badly, but Enron couldn’t afford for the failure to become obvious by letting CalPERS sell its position on the open market.  So Enron created Chewco to bid on the CalPERS position. Chewco was nominally independent, but was in fact funded, owned and run by Enron and its executives, and ultimately backed by the value of Enron’s own stock through a secretly guaranteed bank loan. Chewco bought out CalPERS at an inflated, and fundamentally fraudulent, price.  In nearly the same way, any trade in FTT tokens between Alameda and FTX, or use of FTT for loan collateral, would have reflected a false valuation, because Alameda was not independently pricing the true value of the FTT tokens. The presence of tokens like MAPS and OXY on the Alameda and FTX balance sheets, and their possible use as collateral for borrowing, similarly echo Enron’s use of mark-to-market accounting to manipulate its revenue.  Enron's most infamous mark-to-market maneuver was an early 2000 deal with Blockbuster Video, then a popular retail chain for movie rentals, to build a video streaming service.  This sounds like a well-timed idea, and Enron thought so too – it immediately claimed $110 million in profits from the project, before a single wire was laid or line of code written. This revenue helped pump Enron’s stock price in the quarter the deal was announced, in turn giving it more leverage to deploy in similarly circular fashion. Unfortunately, the Blockbuster streaming project collapsed soon after when movie studios objected, meaning those already-announced profits evaporated retroactively. That ultimately helped unwind the entire Enron fraud.  See also: From Enron to Wirecard: How Blockchain Tech Could Have Helped  One of the fundamental flaws of using venture-style investing to launch publicly tradable tokens is that the same deceptive mark-to-market pricing dynamic is in some sense “baked in.” Unlike a private investment, these tokens immediately begin circulating in public markets, valued based on implied future revenue.  But the FTX tokens circulated only in very small amounts, while the prices derived from that thin trading were translated back to FTX and Alameda’s huge illiquid holdings. This profound distortion of financial reality is sometimes referred to as “low flow, high FDV,” for “fully diluted value.”  When the curtain was pulled back and reality reasserted itself, both for FTX and Enron, the whole charade fell apart.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH | FTT,David Z.

The crypto market decline had been triggered by the FTX collapse, and even now, the negative effects are still being felt all across the space. However, it has also been a time for digital assets in the space to show their resilience. Currently, in the middle of the week, there is already recovery going on and these two digital assets have shown the most promise. XRP Moves Into The Green Like the rest of the crypto market, XRP had not been spared the wrath of the market as it reeled from FTX’s bankruptcy. The token had lost about 30% of its value during this time, finally losing its footing above $0.4. Nevertheless, it continues to put up a good fight, which has now seen the digital asset move into the green. Related Reading: TRX Surges Over 600% Following Justin Sun’s Deal With FTX On a 7-day moving average, the majority of cryptocurrencies in the market are still in the red, some even up to double-digit losses, but XRP has managed to break out of this trend. The digital asset now sits neutral on a 7-day average while seeing minor gains on both the 24-hour and one-hour charts. Data from Coinmarketcap shows that XRP’s price is up 2.33% in the last 24 hours with over 5% gains recorded for Tuesday alone. In the last hour, it is already up 1.18% and this brings it closer to $0.4 once more. If this trend continues, then XRP is likely to break above $0.4 before the close of the midweek trading day. A test of the $0.42 remains likely given the strength that the digital asset continues to show. XRP trending at $0.37 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com There is a decline in the trading volume of the token over the last day which could work against this recovery, but a recovery above $0.4 would put it above its 100-day moving average, triggering buy signals across the board. SHIB Is On The Mend Just like XRP, SHIB is also showing very strong signals in the last day. After falling below $0.00001, the sell-offs has begun quickly, but even this would not last. SHIB is seeing good momentum on a 24-hour basis, although, unlike XRP, it is still recording losses on a 7-day moving average. Add to this that whale accumulation of SHIB is on the rise and it is a recipe for another rally. A major Ethereum whale had been accumulating the meme coin over the last day and has added 653 billion SHIB ($6 million) to its balance during this time. It has dragged up the ranking of the meme coin to number 1 among the largest 5,000 ETH whales during this time. Related Reading: Bitcoin Recovers Above $17,000, Why This Could Be A Bull Trap SHIB burning has also ramped up during this time. A single wallet burned over 51 million SHIB, bringing the 24-hour burn figure above 53 million. The digital asset is also one of the most used smart contracts among the top 1,000 ETH whales. If the accumulation and positive sentiment among whales towards SHIB continue, then the digital asset could see a price above $0.00001 once more before the week runs out.

Corrected to Optimism.  Decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocol MakerDAO said it can now handle “near-instant” transactions and faster withdrawals across the Ethereum blockchain and layer 2 networks for its $6 billion stablecoin, DAI.  The new infrastructure called Maker Teleport enables users to send and withdraw DAI by circumventing the Ethereum blockchain’s base layer, according to a press release Wednesday. Maker Teleport is now available on Ethereum scaling networks Arbitrum and Optimism as part of MakerDAO’s multi-chain strategy to expand DAI to more blockchain networks, the organization said.  The new technology could prove crucial for DAI users because the Ethereum network is prone to congestion and high transaction costs (gas fees) during times of high traffic. Maker Teleport reduces fees and settlement time for transferring DAI from between Ethereum and layer 2 networks, which before could take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few days.  “While the DeFi space has matured significantly over the past few years, many processes remain inefficient, complex or costly, dampening the user experience,” Sam MacPherson, a protocol engineer at MakerDAO, said in the press release.  MakerDAO is one of the biggest players in DeFi, and it also issues the largest decentralized stablecoin, DAI. Recently, it has invested a part of its $8 billion reserve into traditional assets such as U.S. Treasurys and corporate bonds, and decided to break up its organization structure into smaller units in a controversial vote.

""The Treasury market is experiencing higher levels of volatility,"" Barr said in response to a question during an appearance before the Committee on Financial Services. ""That volatility leads to lower levels of liquidity, which we're also seeing in Treasury and other markets."" In an effort to mitigate those issues, Barr said that the Fed has ""put in place a ""backstop facility for repo transactions"" as well as a ""backstop for foreign official repo transactions."" he added that the Fed is currently monitoring a number of capital requirements, such as the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio, to see how they work together. Of note, Treasury yields ( US10Y ) ( US5Y ) ( US2Y ) ( US30Y ) ( US3M ) have soared to the highest levels since the 2008 Great Financial Crisis as the U.S. central bank embraces its most aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s in the wake of stubbornly high inflation. Bearing in mind the inverse relationship of yields and bonds, Treasury bonds ( NASDAQ: TLT ) ( NYSEARCA: ZROZ ) have suffered one of the worst drawdowns on record. Nevertheless, Barr reassured that ""the Treasury market is resilient and robust."" Elsewhere, Barr pointed out that it's important to have robust oversight of stablecoins, or digital representations of more ""stable"" assets such as the U.S. dollar ( DXY ). He described stablecoins as ""a form of private money,"" which ""can generate significant run risks and financial stability risks if not strongly and appropriately regulated.""

Because of this, the value of ETH, a significant alternative currency, has plummeted by over 36% in the last week. Bearish emotion may be pervading over the cryptocurrency market, but the second most popular cryptocurrency is now trading almost sideways. But @sanr king, a contributor to Santiment’s insights, has been thinking about this pricing stability. One should view his observation of a heavy influence from whales in the market with caution, as this is often a precursor to a more severe bear market. Now, what does the ETH chart reveal? Related Reading: Solana Loses 60% Of Its Value After FTX Collapse – Can SOL Bounce Back This Week? ETH Prognosis: Dark Clouds Ahead According to @sanr king, the present market model cannot account for the whales’ “abnormal” accumulation period. This is risky since it suggests the coin is fairly priced in relation to the market as a whole. To recapture bullish momentum, ETH will need the market to correct its overvaluation, which is currently a tall order given the current bearish trend. After losing 6.4% over the past week, ETH’s price is establishing a double bottom in front of the previous price movements. This bearish formation occurs following a retreat, which transpired in the $1,214 price range in this instance. The latest price movement is barely above the 23.60 Fibonacci retracement line. A breach below this Fibonacci level would confirm a bearish break and bolster the market’s existing bearish momentum. The fact that investors are more ready to HODL than sell, reflecting a high level of investor confidence in the present market direction, does not help matters. Which in this instance is a decline. ETH Bears Take The Driver Seat The current position is unlikely to improve in the near future, as a decline is more likely to occur than a rebound. Even though RSI values are rising over the long haul, the CMF value of -0.18 indicates a complete bear market takeover. As the scenario worsens in the next days and weeks, the crypto sector will endure a great deal more of suffering. ETH will soon lose its footing at $1,200 and could fall to the $1,100 range.

News broke early Wednesday that the lending arm of Genesis was pausing redemptions and new loan originations, citing the impact on operations of the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX. (Genesis is owned by CoinDesk parent Digital Currency Group.)  “Throughout the current crypto market turmoil, B2C2 has provided critical liquidity and support to our global client base,"" a B2C2 spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. ""We have continued to price, trade and settle across all our products.”  The spokesperson continued: “The company is in a position to support the wider market by offering to work with Genesis and their counterparties to novate existing loans at Genesis Global Capital to B2C2. Loans will have to fall within our established risk management framework to qualify.”  B2C2 founder and director Max Boonen originally tweeted the offer as a way of helping to “alleviate the current liquidity shortfall.”  “I didn't have Genesis on my bingo card. Wow. That leaves very few players in the OTC market,” he wrote. OTC stands for ""over-the-counter,"" a reference to the marketplace that occurs off exchanges, where deals and trades are negotiated directly between traders.  Asked if the tweet was a formal offer, Boonen told CoinDesk in a direct message that ""it's a desire to open talks."" The offer wouldn't include all of the loans. ""In fact, they likely need a small % of their total book to become liquid,"" he wrote.  Last week, B2C2 announced that group CEO Phillip Gillespie had departed and was replaced by Nicola White, who joined the firm last year from Citadel Securities.

However, the centralization era also led to disregard for consumer protection and massive meltdowns that have affected tens of millions of people and hundreds of billions in assets.  Consumers are learning very hard lessons about the risks of centralization. You can draw a straight historical line from Mt. Gox to Voyager Digital, Celsius Network and now FTX. The inevitable conclusion is that centralized entities pose a systemic risk to the crypto ecosystem. It is well past time that we as a collective crypto community come together to demand better.  Shingo Lavine and Adam Lavine are co-founders of Ethos.io, a decentralized technology company.  Crypto was founded upon the idea of true individual ownership and self-sovereignty as a response to the 2008 financial crisis. It was built to be different, where individuals held the keys to their own wallets and could trade without an intermediary.  The animating vision since Bitcoin’s creation has been to enable all of us to take back control of our money. There is a longstanding truism that ""power corrupts,"" which holds for financial history, too: If you give someone control over your money, they're bound to abuse your trust. This plays out in crypto between self-custody and centralized custodians.  It’s time we returned to the roots of crypto that brought us all together in the first place.  Read more: How Crypto Can Do Good for the World / Opinion  At Ethos.io, we have long been proponents of decentralization and self-custody. In 2017, we designed a decentralized crypto wallet that garnered over 100,000 users, and were then tapped to help build the payment and blockchain rails for Voyager, a centralized crypto broker which scaled to a million users.  In time, we left Voyager because of cultural differences – the management insisted on a centralized path to build up their AUM [assets under management]. Ultimately these funds were lent out to Three Arrows Capital, leading to a swift Voyager bankruptcy.  Unfortunately, both Voyager’s and FTX’s users have learned the hard way that crypto held in accounts on those platforms are not “theirs” – far from it. Centralized exchanges and brokers often co-mingle funds into omnibus wallets, and treat their customers as “unsecured creditors.” Voyager depositors have watched management, employees, lawyers and bankers all consume company capital resources while their crypto remains locked up in the bankruptcy process.  Read more: FTX Showed the Problems of Centralized Finance, and Proved the Need for DeFi / Opinion  It is mind-boggling how often just one person’s actions can impact the fortunes of millions. This is the exact opposite of how crypto is supposed to work and why the centralization era has been so risky. This era must come to an end.  The era of decentralization is the only viable path forward. Crypto must return to its roots and take back power from corrupt institutions that have abused their power and influence.  The last five years have seen several technical breakthroughs that can serve as a foundation for a robust, safe and fair decentralized economy. Decentralized trading platforms promise huge benefits over centralization: lack of counter-party risk, on-chain settlement and transparency. It is simply impossible to trade against your customers.  A properly implemented and maintained decentralized finance (DeFi) economy will service the interest of both customers and operators, not to mention provide encoded consumer protections which regulators are trying to achieve.  Read more: It Can’t Be ‘Decentralization or Bust’ / Opinion  Work must still be done. Vitilak Buterin, co-creator of Ethereum, has written eloquently on the need for secure vaults to minimize the risk of losing your keys. Multi-party cryptography (MPC), layered security and social guardians can make this a reality and leave the days of mnemonics and seed phrases behind.  We are once again at an inflection point where we as a community must defy centralization. We must defy corrupt CEOs who seek to separate us from our money. We must defy corporate secrecy, which has enabled corruption and recklessness paid on the customers’ dime. We must want to return to crypto’s roots and empower individuals to wrest control of what is rightfully theirs.  The future will not be centralized. But we must build it.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | REGULATION | TRADING,"Shingo Lavine, Adam Lavine",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/16/the-end-of-the-centralization-era-in-crypto,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/352f1b0593a05f826e60c13f2764e1769dcdc6e2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The tokens are not yet available for sale – an important distinction to avoid scams – as the nonprofit StarkNet Foundation, which oversees the growth of the ecosystem, works out the best mechanism for distributing them.  Announced in July, the StarkNet Token was designed to help StarkNet achieve decentralization through voting, staking and fee payments. The token launch is high profile due to the network’s active developer community, and the $8 billion valuation awarded to StarkWare during a funding round earlier this year.  StarkWare's technology addresses the scalability problems of the Ethereum blockchain, which cause slow throughput and raise gas, or transaction, fees as the number of transactions increases. The company's rollup technologies bundle hundreds of transactions off the main blockchain to reduce the computational stress.  StarkWare recently announced that the StarkNet Foundation will receive 50.1% of the new tokens, amounting to 5.01 billion tokens.  Tokens held by StarkWare shareholders, employees and independent partner developers are locked in for a four-year period and will then gradually release starting after a year.

Stephens analyst Matt Breese downgraded his rating on the stock to Equal-Weight from Overweight. PVBC suffered an estimated loss of $1.63 per share, a 12% reduction in tangible book value and an almost $50M increase in non-performing assets, the analyst wrote in a note to clients. After the close on Tuesday, Provident Bancorp delayed its 10-Q filing and provided the loss estimate. Note that in mid-October, the Provident Bancorp ( PVBC ) said it was expecting to report a Q3 loss due to a write-down of collateral of repossessed from a crypto mining company. ""The company is still evaluating the actual level of losses due to the recent decline in the cryptocurrency mining industry, and such losses may exceed this estimate,"" PVBC said in an SEC filing. After the company forgave a $27.4M loan, its digital asset mining loan portfolio totaled $76.5M at Sept. 30, 2022, a majority of which it expects to be impaired and placed on non-accrual status with significant related specific reserves. ""While our initial assessment of the October news was that TBV would be down ~3%-6%, the increase in reserve and NPAs per the more recent call report suggests a wider degree of credit disruption than anticipated, with additional details in the most recent delayed 10-Q announcement,"" Breese said. Provident Bancorp ( PVBC ) in its statement, said volatility in bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) prices and increasing energy costs called into question the financial stability of its crypto-mining clients as well as the mining rigs they used for collateral.

BNB’s price continues to show strength after a bearish downtrend with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. BNB’s price continues to hold $270 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for a bounce above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The price of Binance Coin (BNB) has been a standout performer in recent weeks rallying from a low of $280 to a high of $390 before facing rejection due to the current market state that has affected most crypto projects. The crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Binance Coin (BNB) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news broke that Binance would not be taking over FTX and the company had gone bankrupt. Previous months saw the price of most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed. (Data from Binance) Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds Above 0.08; Here Is Why This Is Good For DOGE Army Binance Coin (BNB) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The crypto space has seen a lot of turbulence in the last few days, with many altcoins struggling to show strength after losing key support that was holding off price declines. The current market uncertainty has caused traders and investors to be hesitant to purchase altcoins, as there is no guarantee that they will rise in value any time soon. The news of other exchanges being in the mix of the FTX saga has raised more fears as many investors and traders shy away from investing in some projects, including the price of BNB suffering some major prices as it lost its support of $300. BNB’s price declined to a weekly low of $260 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $275 as the price aims to break higher. The price of BNB needs to flip the region of $300 for BNB price to trend higher and regain its bullish structure. Weekly resistance for the price of BNB – $300. Weekly support for the price of BNB – $200. Price Analysis Of BNB On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of BNB remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $270 support after bouncing off from the region of $260. If the price of BNB breaks above $300, we could see more rallies for BNB price; a break below a region of $270-260 would lead to more sell-offs for BNB with a possibility of price trending to a region of $200. Daily resistance for the BNB price – $300. Daily support for the BNB price – $270-$260. Related Reading: FBI Plans To Extradite FTX Bankman-Fried From Bahamas As Contagion Spills To Genesis?

Bitcoin 7-Day Volatility Has Spiked To Values Above 7% According to the latest weekly report from Arcane Research, the current 7-day volatility levels are the second highest seen in this year. The “volatility” is an indicator that keeps track of the average daily returns in the price of Bitcoin over a specific period of time. While this timespan can be of any length, the “7-day” and “30-day” versions of the metric are the most natural. A notable feature of the volatility indicator is that it only measures returns using the closing prices on each day. This implies that any intraday market movements aren’t accounted for by the metric, so as long as the price returns to the norm by the end of the day. Related Reading: This Indicator Hints US Investors Sold Bitcoin Harder Than Others During Crash When the volatility has a high value, it means the price of the crypto has fluctuated a lot recently. On the other hand, low values suggest the BTC market has been displaying stale activity.

Historically, Bitcoin has become calmer following big spikes in the volatility like the one being observed right now. However, the report notes that the current market environment is filled with contagion-related uncertainty and abnormal positioning in derivatives, so the market will likely continue to be volatile in the coming days.

In the document, it said the initial catalyst was a CoinDesk article on how most of Alameda Research's assets consisted of FTT, FTX's own token. Alameda is a trading firm affiliated with FTX. FTX has since filed for bankruptcy.  ""It is clear from the above that the causes of the collapse of FTX were the financial irregularities and possible fraud initially reported in the CoinDesk article on 2 November,"" the document stated.  The Treasury Committee held a hearing on Monday to question officials from crypto companies in the aftermath of FTX's collapse, and Daniel Tinder, Binance's vice president of governmental affairs of Europe, offered to send the document after Member of Parliament Harriett Baldwin, who is chairwoman of the committee, asked if Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao ""brought about the collapse of FTX?""  The committee also asked Trinder if Binance knew its actions that included unloading much of its FTT holdings on the market and agreeing to acquire FTX before backing out of a deal could lead to the collapse of FTX.  ""But it must have been apparent when that decision was taken that was likely to cause the collapse of FTX, one of your major competitors,"" Baldwin said.

""Grayscale products continue to operate business as usual, and recent events have had no impact on product operations,"" it added.

42421430,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDLJ,1668611241,Crypto Can De-Escalate the Tax War,"There is a tax war between the government and the people, and there always has been. The government badly wants taxes, and people badly don’t want to pay them, so each side battles fiercely for their goal, constantly inventing new weapons in an age-old arms race that continues today.  Collecting taxes is of existential importance to the government because it finances their whole operation. Avoiding paying taxes is of great importance to people because they want to keep the money they make. As a result, this eternal tax war is of huge scale and importance in nearly all times and places.  Zachary Lerangis is the head of operations and chief of staff at Arkham Intelligence. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  The historical record bears this out. The text of the Rosetta Stone is an official government decree largely about royal and priestly taxation. The most comprehensive record we have of the medieval world is the Domesday Book, commissioned by William the Conqueror in 1085 after his conquest of England, which outlined the holdings of every landowner in the country in order to determine what taxes they owed:  “Then sent [William] his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out ‘How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues he ought to have by the year from the shire.’ So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ” (The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle).  The Domesday Book was a major escalation in the tax war. It’s much harder to avoid paying taxes when the government sends its agents everywhere to directly record what everyone owns and owes. Escalation doesn’t only come from the government – the American Revolution can be viewed as a popular escalation in the tax war to outright violent revolt.  See also: The Silver Lining of a Crypto Market Decline: Tax Savings | Opinion  On a lesser scale, many people spend fortunes on complex corporate, legal and accounting schemes intended to minimize their taxes. These escalations are extremely costly and negative-sum. The IRS has an annual budget of $14 billion, and August’s Inflation Reduction Act increased its budget by $80 billion. Where will this funding come from? In large part, more taxes, fueling a vicious cycle.  Therefore, de-escalating the tax war is beneficial to everyone. If the government didn’t employ an army of IRS agents, everyone’s taxes could be lower. And if the people didn’t employ an army of accountants and lawyers to minimize their taxes, they could afford to pay more and still have more money in the bank.  Crypto can de-escalate the tax war. The transparency and immutability of blockchain transactions would allow for tax assessment and collection to be vastly more efficient than the status quo. Imagine a world without tax returns – you could simply report your blockchain addresses, and smart contracts would automatically determine what you owe and pay it.  Read more: The State of Crypto Taxation in India: Past, Present and Future  Cryptographic software systems could be designed for determining that all addresses are reported, transactions are accurately categorized, and tax calculated correctly. The calculation of capital gains, for example, would be trivial with the transaction record that blockchains provide. This objectivity and indisputability could make the job of both the government and taxpayers much easier and less painful.  Some might protest that this amounts to submission by the people in the tax war, but this is not the case. It would be a calculated de-escalation in a field of disadvantage – so that energy could be devoted to other more fruitful avenues of attack.  Fighting the government on assessment and collection is not the right strategy. The right strategy is to work towards a better and more just tax system. Obviously this is hard, but it is the only way. Fighting on assessment and collection doesn’t work collectively or in the long run. It is a defect-defect equilibrium. The government still gets their money. Some people may manage to “minimize” their taxes for some time, but this ultimately comes at the expense of everyone else and it often ends in an even bigger tax bill, or worse, jail.  The government and the people alike currently view crypto as merely another weapon in the tax war, with each trying to use it for their own ends. It can instead be a tool of peace or at least a lasting truce, paving the way towards a just and efficient system.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | ARKM,Zachary Lerangis,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/16/crypto-can-de-escalate-the-tax-war,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8226cae9fd8119ff364fcdefd08d7a5e77453070-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), respectively the chair and ranking member of the committee, said in a joint statement that the lawmakers would want to hear about the collapse of the crypto exchange and its ""broader consequences"" for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The committee plans to hear testimony from now-former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and representatives from FTX, its sister company, Alameda Research, and Binance, which briefly suggested it would acquire FTX.  FTX's collapse harmed over a million users, Waters said in a statement,  ""Unfortunately, this event is just one out of many examples of cryptocurrency platforms that have collapsed just this past year,"" she said. ""... [I] know that we need legislative action to ensure that digital assets entities cannot operate in the shadows outside of robust federal oversight and clear rules of the road.""  In his own statement, which called FTX's failure a ""debacle,"" McHenry said the committee needs to understand what happened for FTX's customers and the American public, citing Congress' role in oversight.  ""It’s essential that we hold bad actors accountable so responsible players can harness technology to build a more inclusive financial system,"" he said.  FTX filed for bankruptcy last week, days after CoinDesk reported a balance sheet belonging to Alameda held a large amount of FTX's own FTT token, raising questions about the amount of real money on either company's books.  The early days of the bankruptcy filing were chaotic. FTX US, which said it wouldn't suspend withdrawals, temporarily did. The parent exchange was hacked on Friday night. And the Securities Commission of the Bahamas said over the weekend that it hadn't ordered FTX to allow local users to withdraw funds, contradicting the reason FTX gave for re-enabling withdrawals in the country days after suspending all withdrawals.  Numerous federal and state regulators are currently investigating FTX.  In a hearing on bank regulators, McHenry expanded on his views, calling it a ""dumpster fire"" and taking aim at Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler for being ""more interested in chasing headlines than bad actors.""  ""FTX users have been left out to dry. The digital asset ecosystem is in limbo,"" he said.

42421439,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXoDQT,1668610916,Use Your Crypto Losses to Turn the Tables Against the IRS,"Disclaimer: This is not tax advice, and we strongly recommend engaging with a tax professional before making any transaction.  This year has not been kind to any crypto investor’s portfolio. Fortunately, there’s one silver lining for all bag-holders with steep losses: tax-loss harvesting. Tax-loss harvesting is a tax minimization strategy in which you strategically sell at a loss to offset gains from other investments (i.e., use crypto losses to offset stock gains).  Smart investors will use this strategy wisely throughout the year to keep from accumulating excessive taxable gains in any given year, which is especially important for anyone living in high-tax states like California or New York.  Jaimin Desai is the co-founder and CEO of Reconcile. This piece is part of CoinDesk's Tax Week.  Here are a couple of things you’ll want to keep in mind about tax-loss harvesting.  When you tax-loss harvest, you maintain the same portfolio value but slightly boost your post-tax return. Here’s how it works:  As the example highlights, tax-loss harvesting helps investors maintain the same portfolio value but lowers their tax liability by offsetting gains with losses. Keep in mind that tax-loss harvesting is not always needed and is more recommended for investors with large tax liabilities or those who are taxed at higher rates.  There are no wash sales to keep in mind when tax-loss harvesting with crypto. According to the wash sale rules, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service will disallow any loss if the same exact security is bought within 30 days before or after selling. Fortunately for crypto investors, crypto is still technically viewed as property from a taxation perspective, so it’s free from the wash sale rule restrictions.  That being said, there is still another IRS rule called the economic substance doctrine, which essentially disallows transactions that are made solely for federal tax avoidance purposes. According to the IRS:  Under section 7701(o)(1), a transaction has economic substance if: (1) the transaction changes in a meaningful way (apart from federal income tax effects) the taxpayer’s economic position; and (2) the taxpayer has a substantial purpose (apart from Federal income tax effects) for entering into such transaction.  So to avoid running afoul of this doctrine, you could presumably sell and rebuy the same crypto after a few days – the logic being that since crypto is so volatile, there is enough economic substance to justify selling and then rebuying. However, selling and then rebuying immediately could definitely raise some flags.  It’s also worth noting that if you have more losses than gains this year, you can deduct up to $3,000 (or $1,500 if married and filing separately) in investment losses against your ordinary income when filing taxes. Realized losses above these limits can be used to offset gains in future years, too.  The IRS lets you lower your ordinary income (i.e., your wages) by deducting your investment losses against it. So if you made $100,000 in 2022, you can lower your taxable income by up to $3,000 – to a new total of $97,000. Depending on what your marginal tax rate is and the state you live in, you could potentially save at least $1,000 in taxes just by realizing your investment losses.  Investments that are reported on Schedule D of your tax return include stocks, bonds, crypto, collectibles and homes. So you can use losses from any of these asset classes to offset each other and get to $3,000 in deductible losses. For example, if you had $15,000 in crypto losses and $10,000 in stock gains, you would have a net loss of $5,000. You can deduct up to $3,000 and then use the remaining $2,000 in losses to offset gains in 2023 and beyond.  To summarize, tax-loss harvesting using crypto is one of the best and most accessible investment strategies anyone can take. If you’re a high earner or someone who lives in a high-tax state, you should look into tax-loss harvesting, as you may be able to save up to 50% on your capital gains tax bill. Also, before engaging in any transaction, be sure to talk to a professional who knows your entire situation and can better advise you on the right decision.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | REGULATION,Jaimin Desai,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/16/lower-tax-bill-crypto-losses,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/82217691882b34fcac9166cf107eb43a74de13c5-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42411682,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glfEz8,1668610676,What Are Utility NFTs?,"While non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are often associated with JPEG images, their real-world use cases continue to grow.  As interest in digital collectibles surged last year, much of the focus was on profile picture (PFP) NFTs, or NFTs that can be used as avatars on social media. Influenced by Larva Labs’ successful NFT project CryptoPunks, PFP projects quickly dominated Twitter and marketplaces like OpenSea during the peak of NFT hype. Other types of NFTs, like generative art, have also swelled in popularity in recent months.  Art-focused NFT projects remain popular among collectors, though many creators are adding on real-world experiences and rewards to their digital collectibles. This concept is referred to as utility, which gives the digital asset broader value beyond being just a collectible.  Whether the additional value is a physical item or a membership to an event or website, utility NFTs present significant opportunities for brands and creators to expand the use cases for NFTs.  What are NFTs?  NFTs are crypto assets that represent a unique item, whether that be a real-world object like a sneaker or a digital asset like a blockchain game skin. These tradable assets cannot be interchanged with one another, and data about the NFT is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts.  Because NFTs are minted and tracked on the blockchain, they are often used to verify the authenticity and ownership of a particular asset.  How to add utility to NFTs  Utility NFTs enhance the concept of digital collectibles by providing holders with real-world rewards and other privileges linked to ownership. Instead of looking at NFTs as just collectible artwork, they can be used for a variety of practical applications, like acting as a ticket to an event or providing a holder with long-term membership to a club.  Some NFT projects, like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Doodles, launched as PFP artwork and gradually began adding utility for holders, like exclusive access to branded parties or meetups. Other NFT projects add utility from the start, like Coachella Collectibles, which grants holders a lifetime pass to the music festival, alongside other benefits like unique on-site experiences and physical goods.  Utility as access to events and locations  Some of the original utility NFTs functioned as access to unique platforms. One of the most common digital access features provided by utility NFTs is access to exclusive Discord channels.  As utility NFTs have evolved, they’ve also presented new ways to provide holders with digital access to events and platforms. Americana, for example, is an online marketplace for physical collectors seeking luxury items, similar to resale sites like Grailed or StockX. To buy or sell items with Americana, users are required to hold a Something Token (their native NFT) to signify their membership to the ecosystem.  Another example is Token Proof, a token gating platform and app, where users can verify the ownership of their NFTs and access real-world events without connecting their crypto wallet. Entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk, as another example, issued tickets to his VeeCon crypto conference using utility NFTs.  Beyond ticketing to one-off events, utility NFTs are also frequently used as membership cards for exclusive clubs or restaurants. NFT social clubs have created more long-term options for NFT holders looking to meet up with their community and collaborate in the same space. And earlier this year, internet collective Poolsuite launched Manor DAO, which will provide token-gated access to a property they plan to purchase called Poolsuite Manor.  In addition, Vaynerchuk recently announced the launch of a New York seafood restaurant called the Flyfish Club that can only be accessed by NFT holders.  NFTs linked to real-world items  While token-gated access through utility NFTs presents a unique way for communities to come together, some NFT projects are also linking physical and digital rewards to NFT ownership.  PROOF collective, for example, uses NFTs to provide holders with a range of benefits, including access to future PROOF NFT drops like the popular Moonbirds PFP project.  And more often, both Web2 and Web3 brands have used utility NFTs to reward their holders with physical items like apparel. Adidas, for example, created a custom line of crypto-themed clothing specifically for holders of their Into The Metaverse community, while Nike’s digital fashion brand RTFKT allowed holders of the CloneX collection to “forge” their digital tokens into physical goods.  As the application of utility NFTs continues to grow, they can be used by a range of industries to provide holders with anything from access cards to discounts in-store, ensuring that NFTs retain value for holders long-term.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | MINING,Griffin Mcshane,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-are-utility-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/79c8a69e225a981c8324818f8ab8682b6204b39f-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Temasek invested in both the FTX mothership and its U.S. wing in concurrent funding rounds of $400 million each in January. The fund is now prepared to write off the entire amount of its investments, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter.

It remains to be seen to what extent having to write off $200 million to 300 million on the back of FTX's dramatic collapse will damp Temasek's appetite for the digital-assets industry. Temasek managed $294 billion in assets as of the end of March, according to Bloomberg.  FTX went from being one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world to filing for bankruptcy in little over a week after irregularities in the balance of sheet of its sister firm Alameda Research came to light following a CoinDesk report on Nov. 2.

A consultation published today is looking into questions such as how DAOs, the disparate platforms governed by code which often underpin projects in decentralized finance (DeFi), are structured and governed, and how they comply with obligations like taxes, money laundering and the corporate reporting.  “DAOs are said to offer multiple benefits to market participants… yet their legal and regulatory status is unclear,” said Law Commissioner Sarah Green in a statement. “Our work will aim to build consensus on the best ways of describing the constituent elements of DAOs and to highlight ways in which the law of England and Wales might foster their development.”  The probe will look into issues like the relationship between DAOs and corporations; the status of investors and token holders; the legal liability of open-source code developers; and the ways in which DAOs tackle money laundering, file annual reports and pay taxes, the commission said.  The commission, a government-funded independent body charged with reviewing and updating the legal code in England and Wales, has already probed the legal status of crypto assets in a document published in July. Treating crypto as a new kind of legal property could have implications if, say, your computer is hacked and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stolen, Green previously told CoinDesk in an interview, and final recommendations are due next year.  A commission review of smart contracts concluded in November 2021, and its proposals on using electronic documents as receipts in international trade have already been proposed as a legislative bill.  In the U.S., courts are considering procedural questions such as how the Commodity Futures Trading Commission can serve legal documents on Ooki DAO, and whether the unconventional structures are immune from regulatory enforcement.

42422017,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOMZ,1668607200,Matter Labs Nets $200M to Build zkSync Ethereum Scaling Platform,"Ethereum development firm Matter Labs has raised a monster $200 million to support the launch of its zkSync V2 rollup network, one of the major platforms vying for dominance in a crowded competition to reduce Ethereum’s fees and increase its transaction speeds.  Matter Labs’ Series C funding round, which closed before the market was roiled by the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, was co-led by Blockchain Capital and Dragonfly, and was joined by venture capital heavyweights including Variant, Lightspeed Venture Partners and Andreessen Horowitz.  Alongside its funding announcement, Matter Labs pledged to file its core software under an MIT Open Source license by the end of 2022, meaning third parties will be allowed to view, use and augment zkSync’s code.  Additionally, Matter Labs Chief Product Officer Steve Newcomb told CoinDesk that his team had begun “talking about the research that we're putting into understanding how to generate a ‘Fair’ token standard,” though he stopped short of announcing an official token.  Matter Labs did not disclose a valuation to CoinDesk, but the new funding brings the total amount raised by the firm to $458 million – a large sum, even in the wild world of crypto, that Matter hopes will put it on solid footing in the deeply competitive Ethereum scaling race.  ""When Google raised money just before the .com crash, it made them a king,” Newcomb wrote in a message to CoinDesk following an interview last week. “[N]o matter how bad this bear market gets, we are well positioned well to grow our team, ship our protocol and ship our mission.""  Read more: Ethereum Scaling Platform zkSync v2 Goes Live Amid Controversy  Zero Knowledge rollups  Rollups exist as a way to ease Ethereum’s high fees and slow speeds, which have iced out users and bred a number of competing networks and copycats.  zkSync is a kind of zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup platform – a so-called “layer 2” network that processes transactions separately from Ethereum, bundles them up, and passes them back down to the main Ethereum network so they can be written to its ledger for a fraction of the cost of normal transactions.  Read more: What Are Rollups? ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups Explained  ZK rollups use complex cryptographic seals called zero-knowledge proofs to ensure that the transactions they pass down to Ethereum reflect real user activity. This fancy computer code, which is supposed to prevent a central party (like Matter Labs) from spoofing transactions, is considered a breakthrough in the Ethereum scaling race since it will eventually make transacting on zkSync similar – security-wise – to transacting on Ethereum itself.  Other companies in addition to Matter Labs, like the research-oriented Scroll platform and the Ethereum juggernaut Polygon, are progressing on their own ZK-rollup platforms. Together, these firms represent the first cohort of a new class of so-called zkEVMS – ZK rollups which, unlike past applications of the technology (including an older version of the zkSync network), will be able to support virtually any program that runs on Ethereum.  zkSync V2  The version of zkSync that launched on Ethereum in October, the “baby alpha” version of zkSync V2, is only open for internal testing by the Matter Labs team. According to a public roadmap put out by the firm, any whitelisted project will be able to launch on zkSync to run their own tests in a soon-to-arrive update to the platform, with users eventually gaining access to the platform in a subsequent update slated for late 2022 or early 2023.  “One of the things we want to educate people on with ZK technology is by the fact that we have not concentrated on performance yet,” said Newcomb, warning that initial transaction speeds and fees may not initially be as impressive as hoped. “We're just getting everything working right now,” he continued.  So far, Newcomb says that over 150 projects – including major decentralized finance platforms like Uniswap and Aave – have committed to launching on zkSync, which he hopes will bolster the platform’s chance of becoming a dominant player in a crowded field of competing rollups.  Securing trust  When zkSync V2 launched on Ethereum’s mainnet last month, it did so amid questions about whether its core technology – the complicated zero-knowledge proofs that are supposed to secure user funds – is ready for prime time.  In response to a widely shared tweet from one of zkSync’s competitors questioning the existence of zkSync’s driving technology, Newcomb shared evidence with CoinDesk of its zero-knowledge prover working to verify transactions end-to-end.  Read more: The Sudden Rise of EVM-Compatible ZK Rollups  “We have publicly verifiable links all over the place for people doing proofs on test net. We have it launched on mainnet,” said Newcomb. “That's why we celebrated [the baby alpha launch] so much, because getting an end-to-end prover for general purpose contracts is a very, very big deal.”  To prevent similar controversy in the future, Newcomb said that Matter Labs would open-source its code under the relatively permissive MIT License – a step that some competing platforms have yet to take. Newcomb also said that Matter Labs would support wider Ethereum community efforts to standardize best practices around how rollups should launch and communicate limitations to users.  Wen token?  zkSync, unlike several other scaling platforms, has no token associated with its platform. The much-hyped launch of the V2 of its platform has led to speculation that a token might be coming.  Newcomb says that Matter Labs will likely be “the last project” to launch a token, but he did hint at how a zkSync token could eventually be distributed.  According to Newcomb, a third of tokens would go to “shareholders” in zkSync, which could include Matter Labs employees and investors. The other two-thirds would apparently go to the zkSync “ecosystem,” though it's unclear exactly how or to whom those funds would be disbursed.  “We have no comment whatsoever on anyone trying to have strategies for token drops,” said Newcomb.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | ZK,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/16/matter-labs-nets-200m-to-build-zksync-ethereum-scaling-platform,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/98227ebf23cd9e8842f93dc11c2365270cb9fb22-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Online investing platform BnkToTheFuture has dropped a plan to acquire the crypto lender Salt Lending due to FTX exposure. The political backlash is growing, too. Lawmakers in Washington grilled U.S. financial regulators on Tuesday.  The FTX debacle has brought deep dislocation in digital-asset markets, and analysts are racing to make sense of it all and what comes next. The art of “on-chain analysis” – the practice of extracting data from on-chain transactions and then interpreting it – is one of the first areas to get tested; historically, outflows from big crypto exchanges meant that investors were getting more bullish, moving their coins to long-term custody or storage to hold for the medium or long term. But a recent uptick in outflows might mean that investors are losing faith in the exchanges. Data also shows that crypto traders are increasingly turning to decentralized-finance (DeFi) protocols for their exchange and lending needs.  It’s now been more than a week since the price of bitcoin hit a two-year low at around $15,600, and questions are invariably forming on whether the market bottom is in. The largest cryptocurrency’s price has inched back up to $16,600. Price charts suggest a drop down to $13,000 is still possible, and traders in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s bitcoin futures market appear to be piling into a big “short” trade – bets on further price declines. What’s clear from the data over the past two weeks is just how much cryptocurrencies trade in sync when there’s a big market shakeout: Check out this analysis of the correlations between CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) sectors. On the other hand, the idiosyncratic drivers might be creeping back: The decentralized-exchange protocol Serum’s SRM tokens doubled in price Tuesday as key backers of the project rallied around an emergency fork in response to last Friday's hack at FTX.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows gold-backed cryptocurrencies like PAXG and XAUT have put in a positive performance in the past seven days, decoupling from the broader market swoon.  These cryptocurrencies might become safe havens as other tokens reel under the pressure of FTX's collapse and gold prices rise on the back of a weaker dollar.  Gold has gained 9% this month, reaching a three-month high of $1,768 per ounce, while the dollar index has dropped nearly 5%.  – Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  Genesis’ Crypto-Lending Unit Is Halting Customer Withdrawals in Wake of FTX Collapse  Luna Foundation Guard Spent $2.8B Defending UST Peg, Third-Party Audit Finds  FTX Debacle Might Change Hong Kong’s Approach to Retail Crypto Regulation; Bitcoin Shows Its Mettle",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Bradley Keoun, Sage D.

Gosalia pointed out that the digital asset-focused bank's potentially lower deposit balances represent the biggest risk to its earnings. Recall last week when Silvergate ( SI ) CEO Alan Lane said his company's exposure to the now-bankrupt FTX was less than 10% of its total digital asset deposits totaling $11.9B, and its relationship with FTX was limited solely to deposits. In turn, ""the company will likely see all of its FTX deposits flow out,"" the analyst, who views SI as an Equal-Weight pick, wrote in a note. ""In addition, depending on the liquidity issues its other clients are currently facing, and depending on how much those clients de-leverage / de-risk, there could be additional deposit outflows."" The analyst expects SI's digital deposit balances to fall 20% Q/Q in Q4 followed by a 10% slump in Q1 2023, bringing deposit balances back down to early 2021 levels. While Silvergate ( SI ) has a number of sources of liquidity to fund deposit outflows, those sources ""are more expensive than SI's zero cost digital deposits, and will weigh on earnings,"" the note read. Given these developments, Gosalia has lowered his 2023 EPS estimate by 51% to $4.48 compared with the Street consensus of $5.95.

42411313,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glMzal,1668606300,4 Key Takeaways from the FTX Fiasco,"Depending upon whom you ask, last week’s FTX blowup feels bigger than when Mt. Gox, the original Bitcoin exchange, fell to ruin in 2014. Bigger than The DAO hack of 2016, which forced Ethereum to fork into two chains as a way to recover user funds. Bigger, too, than the implosion of Terra, the crypto stablecoin operator that went bust this past spring and brought down firms like Voyager, Celsius, and 3AC in its wake.  FTX’s financial impact was smaller than some of the events. So why does it feel existential?  Maybe it’s because crypto is already in the midst of a brutal bear market, making yet another blow feel heavier than it would have at the market’s peak.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Perhaps it’s because the key person behind the failure, FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, was until a week ago considered crypto’s white knight, trusted by sophisticated investors and institutions as one of the most responsible actors in the space.  But, in this writer’s opinion, the real reason why FTX was such a colossal failure is not because the crypto industry was duped, but because it proved that the industry was vulnerable to being duped.  This distinction, while seemingly minor, strikes at the core of what crypto is supposed to be – a foundation to build systems that are trustless. The FTX blowup and contagion are proving, yet again, that the crypto industry, if not its core technology, is currently as trust-based and corruptible as the traditional financial system that it sought to circumvent.  The ‘Crypto Industry’ isn’t ‘Crypto’  We need to do a better job of differentiating between Crypto and the Crypto Industry.  Capital-’C’ Crypto will not be killed by FTX. The core technology undergirding platforms like Ethereum and Bitcoin are still working as advertised. FTX and its sister company Alameda Research used blockchains and cryptocurrency, but they were old-fashioned companies killed by old-fashioned fraud.  As for the Crypto Industry, FTX will prove cataclysmic. We can talk all we want about the sanctity of “decentralized” and “trustless” technology, but so much of the attention and money that has poured into the space over the past several years has gone toward companies like FTX, BlockFi, Celsius and Voyager – unregulated, token-based extensions of traditional finance.  Sure, we always knew that these weren’t really Crypto companies, but investors, influencers and users let that distinction slide. We let these companies use their venture-backed liquidity reserves to pump up tokens and entice retail investors with promises of sky-high yields.  As these companies die, so too should the insane valuations, free-money schemes and money-printing accounting practices that have come to typify the Crypto Industry.  DeFi has shown promise…  Decentralized finance (DeFi) – tools built on blockchains that allow people to trade and transact without centralized intermediaries – are pitched as a direct antidote to frauds like the one that seems to have been perpetrated by FTX.  As fear continues to spread around the solvency of centralized platforms like Crypto.com, decentralized platforms like Aave and Uniswap claim to be structurally incapable of misappropriating user funds.  These platforms, which require users to trust code rather than central parties, have generally proven resilient amidst the FTX turmoil.  As my former CoinDesk colleague Andrew Thurman noted on Twitter, DeFi platforms have seen big boosts in activity over the past week as their centralized counterparts have been experiencing record withdraws:  …But DeFi isn’t a fix-all  DeFi is just a tool. While it carries certain intrinsic advantages relative to other tools (e.g. transparency), it can be used for good or for ill.  DeFi did not fall apart as a result of FTX, but this week reminded us that incumbent DeFi ecosystems are not immune to rot from the wider, oligarchical crypto ecosystem.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, Solana’s DeFi ecosystem, already struggling amid the market downturn of the past few months, was crushed by the failure of FTX.  This failure stemmed largely from the SBF-empire’s massive stake in the Solana ecosystem – not only in terms of its token holdings, but in terms of the role that FTX developers played in building out the projects at the core of the network’s DeFi ecosystem. For example, CoinDesk reported last week on Serum – a leading Solana DeFi platform that was built and maintained by FTX engineers.  Though FTX couldn’t easily steal Serum funds, governance rights on the platform were basically controlled by SBF’s own developers, and the “Serum DAO” that was supposed to govern the protocol was virtually toothless when it came to making changes.  Moreover, FTX and Alameda’s outsized stake in certain low-market-cap tokens granted it the theoretical ability to manipulate markets.  The FTX-Solana contagion is not the only recent example of DeFi’s corruptibility. Terra, which was ostensibly decentralized, has been accused of using venture money to rope in retail investors to fuel its $60 billion blowup.  Even more credibly decentralized platforms, like Uniswap, have faced scrutiny this week. The venture firm Andressen Horowitz and centralized exchange Binance have amassed a large amount of governance power within the leading decentralized exchange’s governance system.  Though you may not agree with his full take, Ben Thompson encapsulated one skeptical viewpoint on DeFi in this week’s edition of his stellar Stratechery newsletter:  “The FTX case is not, technically speaking, about cryptocurrency utility; it is a pretty straightforward case of fraud. Moreover, it was [...] a problem of centralization, as opposed to true DeFi. Such disclaimers do, though, have a whiff of ‘communism just hasn’t been done properly': I already made the case that centralization is an inevitability at scale, and in terms of utility, that’s the entire problem. An entire financial ecosystem with a void in terms of underlying assets may not be fraud in a legal sense, but it sure seems fraudulent in terms of intrinsic value.”  Hero worship needs to stop  Before his spectacular fall from grace last week, SBF was a kind of crypto golden boy. Dubbed the JP Morgan of Crypto, SBF recently began facing criticism in some corners of Crypto Twitter for his pro-regulation stances (which seem more cynical in retrospect), but in general, when he spoke, people listened.  Despite long-standing questions around Alameda’s relationship with FTX, savvy investors trusted SBF, poured billions into his custody and promoted his platform to retail investors.  The lionization of SBF in the mainstream press, crypto press and Crypto Twitter is undoubtedly a big reason why the FTX collapse was so painful. But now that SBF is public enemy number one, Twitter has been filled with a wave of self-righteous critics.  Among the most vocal SBF critics over the past week have been recent industry villains like Terra creator Do Kwon and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) founders Su Zhu and Kyle Davies. After months of relative quiet, the trio have used the negative attention on SBF to mount their own comebacks – hoping, apparently, that attacking the FTX founder along with everyone else will help them rebuild their own sullied reputations.  It’s doubtful that any of these folks will succeed. However, the re-emergence of these characters – along with waves of sycophantic tweets in support of Binance’s Changpeng Zhao and Tron’s Justin Sun – should reminded us of the toxic role that hero worship has played, and continues to play in the “trustless” world of cryptocurrency.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/17/4-key-takeaways-from-the-ftx-fiasco,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a27a9c001053b1f9481c22ab65f7a7f91c6a0cdb-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422016,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOIR,1668603600,Genesis’ Crypto-Lending Unit Is Halting Customer Withdrawals in Wake of FTX Collapse,"The lending arm of crypto investment bank Genesis Global Trading is temporarily suspending redemptions and new loan originations in the wake of FTX’s collapse, Interim CEO Derar Islim told customers on a call Wednesday.  The unit, known as Genesis Global Capital, serves an institutional client base and had $2.8 billion in total active loans as of the end of the third quarter of 2022, according to the company’s website.  Genesis Trading, which acts as Genesis Global Capital’s broker/dealer, is independently capitalized and operated separately from that lending unit, Islim said. He added that Genesis’ trading and custody services remain fully operational.  Islim told the participants on the call that Genesis is exploring solutions for the lending unit, including finding a source of fresh liquidity. He said Genesis intends to detail its plan to clients next week.  Genesis owner Digital Currency Group (DCG) is also the parent company of CoinDesk.  ""Today Genesis Global Capital, Genesis's lending business, made the difficult decision to temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations. This decision was made in response to the extreme market dislocation and loss of industry confidence caused by the FTX implosion,"" said Amanda Cowie, vice president of communications and marketing at DCG.  ""This decision impacts the lending business at Genesis and does not affect Genesis’s trading or custody businesses. Importantly, this decision has no impact on the business operations of DCG and our other wholly owned subsidiaries,"" Cowie added.  The decision follows a punishing period for the industry after this month’s implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto companies FTX and Alameda Research. Islim said FTX’s dramatic fall had spurred withdrawal requests that exceeded Genesis’ current liquidity.  Last week, Genesis disclosed that its derivatives unit had about $175 million in locked funds in its FTX trading account. As a result, DCG opted to strengthen Genesis’ balance sheet with an equity infusion of $140 million.  The announcement was noted by Gemini, the crypto exchange and custodian that has a partnership with Genesis.  ""We are working with the Genesis team to help customers redeem their funds from the Earn program as quickly as possible,"" Gemini said in a statement. ""We are disappointed that the Earn program [service agreement] will not be met, but we are encouraged by Genesis’ and its parent company Digital Currency Group’s commitment to doing everything in their power to fulfill their obligations to customers under the Earn program.""  Stablecoin issuer Tether also confirmed in a blog post Wednesday that it had no exposure to either Genesis or Gemini Earn. “Tether is operating business as usual,” the company wrote.  Crypto-focused financial-services firm Galaxy Digital (GLXY) also shared a statement with CoinDesk on Wednesday saying it had no exposure to Genesis’ lending business nor to Gemini's Earn program. Galaxy acknowledged last week that it had exposure of around $76.8 million in cash and digital assets to FTX.  USDC stablecoin issuer Circle wrote in a blog post on Thursday that Genesis is a counterparty in Circle Yield, Circle's fixed-term yield product for institutional investors. The company said that as of Nov. 17, Circle Yield had $2.6 million in loans outstanding that were protected by ""robust collateral agreements"" and that outstanding loan balances remian overcollateralized.  Genesis suffered major losses earlier this year due to the failure of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).

DOGE’s price continues to show strength after a bearish downtrend with the market’s current state, as things look uncertain for most traders and investors. DOGE’s price continues to hold $0.08 on the daily timeframes as the price aims for a bounce above the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) The price of Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a standout performer for October, rallying with over 100% gains in 24 hours. Still, In the last few days, the crypto market has seen some drastic shift in sentiment, with Dogecoin (DOGE) and the price of other altcoins battling for survival after the news broke that Binance would not be taking over FTX and the company had gone bankrupt. Most altcoins trend higher as many produced gains of over 200%, including DOGE rallying from a region of $0.55 to a high of $0.15, with many hoping for more recovery bounce. Still, these expectations were cut short by the uncertainty surrounding the crypto market, leading to much fear about where the market is headed.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Analysis On The Weekly Chart The past few days have been filled with so much turbulence in the crypto space as many altcoins have struggled to show strength after losing their key support holding off price decline. The current uncertainty surrounding the market has resulted in reluctance on the part of traders and investors to make altcoin purchases, as there is no assurance if they would be heading up any time soon. The news of other exchanges being in the mix of the FTX saga has raised more fears as many investors and traders shy away from investing in some projects, but this is not so for the DOGE army as they have defended $0.08 acting as a good support area for more rallies. DOGE’s price declined to a weekly low of $0.073 before bouncing off this region, showing some great strength to a region of $0.088 as the price aims to break higher. The price of DOGE needs to flip the region of $0.1 for DOGE price to trend higher. Weekly resistance for the price of DOGE – $0.1. Weekly support for the price of DOGE – $0.07. Price Analysis Of DOGE On The Daily (1D) Chart The price of DOGE remains considerably strong in the daily timeframe as the price trades above $0.08 support after bouncing off from the region of $0.075. If the price of DOGE breaks above $0.1, we could see more rallies for DOGE price; a break below a region of $0.07 would lead to more sell-offs for DOGE. Daily resistance for the DOGE price – $0.1. Daily support for the DOGE price – $0.08-$0.075.

As a result, the industry giant and Genesis’ parent company, Digital Currency Group, has reportedly promised a $140 million capital infusion to bolster its balance sheet. An email from Genesis to its customers states: While the operation of our lending and trading businesses has not been impacted by recent market events, Genesis has taken steps to strengthen its balance sheet with an additional equity infusion of $140M from our parent company, Digital Currency Group. However, Autism Capital, a Twitter channel that has received strong attention in the wake of the FTX collapse due to its proximity to the events, is warning of another hard blow to the crypto industry. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Stuck Below $17K, What Could Spark A Decent Increase The Twitter user reports, citing “semi credible rumors” that Genesis may have solvency problems. They are having a call with their creditors tomorrow at 8 AM EST to explain the situation. If true, they may possibly be dissolving ETHE and GBTC to pay back their lenders. We will know more tomorrow. We are aware that Grayscale controls GBTC and ETHE, not Genesis. DCG (the parent company of Genesis and Grayscale) is backstopping Genesis, and dissolving the trusts may be necessary if there is a solvency issue, and if it is big enough. At presstime, the Bitcoin seemed unfazed by the rumors and was trading at $16.596. Levels of importance for Bitcoin are $17.3K and $18K to the upside as well as $14K and $16.5k to the downside. [Update:] Genesis is halting withdrawals for the time being. We recognize how challenging this past week has been due to the impact of the FTX news.

TON saw a price increase of 1.52% on the day while gaining ground against BTC and ETH. It also reached an intraday high of $1.71. However, it has retracted, sitting at $1.69 press time. The blockchain’s native token has also had a positive week. Despite falling to $1.33 at the start of the week, it recovered quickly and posted a 5.57% increase. Toncoin’s positive moves can be attributed to its parent company, Telegram’s latest username feature. Related Reading: Avalanche Looks To Capitalize On GameFi Segment – Will This Give AVAX Some Boost? Telegram Allows Users To Buy Unique Usernames This week, Telegram officially launched a new feature that enables the auctioning off of usernames. Users of Telegram now have the ability to auction off their usernames for their accounts, public groups, or channels, as stated by Telegram. The feature is quite similar to the ENS domains on the Ethereum network. The auction was hosted by Fragment, a free marketplace for trading collectibles between users. According to Telegram, it’ll use the TON blockchain to secure the ownership and uniqueness of each username. The company also mentioned that users could create many aliases for their accounts, groups, and channels. Telegram added: For the first time in the history of social media, people have full ownership of their usernames. Long-time Telegram users who have been using short usernames they registered for early on can now benefit from the platform’s growth by selling their usernames in fair, transparent, fully decentralized auctions. Toncoin Surges As New Accounts And Wallet Holders Increase TON has also enjoyed surges in other areas, including the number of new accounts and wallets holding the token. As per data from CoinMarketCap, the number of wallets holding TON increased by over 12% in the last 7 days. On November 10, the number of unique wallet addresses was 2,546. However, it surged sharply on the 13th, adding over 200 unique addresses between then and today, the 16th. The number of new account registration on the blockchain has also increased since the start of November. Data obtained from the TON official Telegram channel noted a 1% rise between November 6th and 12th. This increased the number of new accounts to 1,421,079, up from 1,406,699. These increases don’t come as a surprise, given the launch of the Telegram username auction and Fragment marketplace. As of writing, TON’s market cap had jumped 1.46%, though trading its 24-hour trading volume was down over 30%. Related Reading: Dogecoin (DOGE) Prints Bullish Pattern, Why It Could Surge to $0.11 The latest features on Telegram are a big step forward for Web3. In August, Pavel Durov, founder of Telegram, first introduced the concept of username ownership being recorded on the blockchain.

The audit also suggests that Terraform Labs (TFL), the developer of the Terra blockchain, spent $613 million trying to defend the peg. A stablecoin is an asset that is designed to mirror the value of another asset, commonly fiat currencies. UST was an algorithmic stablecoin, designed to maintain its peg through market forces.  The efforts of LFG and TFL ultimately failed, with the value of UST falling to zero as the $60 billion ecosystem met its demise. The collapse led to widespread contagion across the crypto industry, with numerous lenders, brokers and exchanges filing for bankruptcy protection due to exposure to the ecosystem.  “While there have been multiple recent failures in crypto, it is important to distinguish between Terra’s case, where a transparent, open-source decentralized stablecoin failed to maintain peg parity and its creators spent proprietary capital to try to defend it, and failure of centralized custodial platforms where its operators misused other people’s money (customer funds) for financial gain,"" said Do Kwon, Terraform Labs founder.

The token had joined the entire crypto market in its downward trend after the FTX implosion. However, exchanges like KuCoin may benefit from the recent failure of the FTX collapse. Johnny Lyu, CEO of KuCoin, assured consumers after FTX’s bankruptcy that the exchange would never misappropriate user assets and be transparent. Lyu’s call for transparency was the main catalyst behind the token’s recent surge. KuCoin has publicly stated that Merkle proof-of-reserves would be available in one month. Related Reading: Chainlink Suffers 40% Loss In Last 7 Days – Can LINK Regain $9 Mark This Week? KuCoin CEO Believes Proof-of-Reserve Will Re-establish User Trust In Centralized Exchanges KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu was the first to declare ‘Proof of Reserves’ after the FTX Token FTT/USD disaster. Lyu stated ‘Proof of Reserves’ is a direct reaction to user concern as they stay locked out of their cash with some exchanges restricting withdrawals. According to the CEO, the exchange will release its Proof of Reserve data in four weeks. He believes that the report will assure customers that their money is secure. Lyu also added the data would back his claims that the company has sufficient cash to payout mass withdrawals. Lyu says the present market situation is like a “growing disease.” He attributes it to the precipitous drop in the value of cryptocurrencies. In the space of a few days, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell from $1 trillion to $873 billion. “It’s painful to watch innocent users hurt,” he added, conceding that traders will need time to trust crypto exchanges again. What’s The Market Outlook For KuCoin Token (KCS) After a 0.72% decrease over the past 24 hours, the global cryptocurrency market seems to be struggling. The global market volume also declined by 1.35% within this period. In spite of these improvements, the global market cap is still less than $900 billion. This indicates that the majority of cryptocurrencies have not yet recovered from the significant drop that occurred over the weekend. As of writing, BTC is down over 5% while ETH fluctuates 1.09% week-on-week. KuCoin is also down2.94% on the day. However, its 1h chart appears bullish, and we might see the coin trade green in the coming days. During this period, there has been a significant price fluctuation, as the coin’s value has fluctuated between $7.45 and $8.29. The price chart for KuCoin shows a clear upward trend as investors rush to capitalize on its recent price appreciation. If the token keeps going, KCS will attempt the $8.29 resistance level one more. This might see it break out to $8.75 and maybe $9. Related Reading: FTX Hacker Becomes 35th Largest Ethereum (ETH) Whale – Dump Incoming?

Allaire addressed the letter to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Cali) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who chair the House Committee for Financial Services and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs respectively, as well as ranking members Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) and Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn).  Inaction in this area will ""stunt America's voice"" as other jurisdictions make progress with establishing comprehensive regulatory regimes for digital assets, according to Allaire.  ""The United States is at risk of missing an opportunity to set the rules that will govern the future of payments, money, and other sectors of the global economy,"" Allaire said in the letter. He cited China's development of the digital yuan ""with the goal of outpacing the United States and replacing the dollar as the world's reserve currency.""  Allaire also referred to the risk to consumers in the absence of a clear way of identifying which stablecoins adhere to a bona fide regulatory regime.  ""Not all stablecoins are created equal,"" he wrote, possibly referring to terraUSD (UST), which plummeted in value in June causing billions of dollars in losses to users worldwide.  Allaire said ""reasonable, workable, and clear legislation can unleash new economic activity"" through the reassurance it would offer to businesses and consumers that the value embedded in stablecoins is protected by the law. Users would be ""shielded from deleterious and irresponsible financial alchemy.""  A stablecoin bill had been expected by many to make its way through Congress sometime this year, however negotiations became bogged down owing to disagreements over topics such as the role of state regulators, the possibility of a future digital dollar in the U.S. and the treatment of customer money held by crypto platforms.

42422025,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOUp,1668591632,"Institutions Take Bearish Stance on Bitcoin, Create Arbitrage Opportunity","Institutions and multi-asset investors returned to the crypto market last week, but not in a way the bulls would have liked to see.  Analysts said these entities took short or bearish bets in bitcoin (BTC) futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), causing backwardation, where futures prices are lower than the spot price. And the market anomaly has created an ""arbitrage opportunity"" – a strategy aimed at profiting from price gap in different markets.  ""Institutional activity in CME has blossomed, but activity has been heavily concentrated towards the short side,"" Vetle Lunde said in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""CME’s November contract has traded at an extreme discount to spot in the last week.""  Bitcoin's front-month CME futures traded at an average daily discount of around 3.6% (annualized 43.8%) last week, according to data provided by Arcane Research. That's wider than the discount seen during the coronavirus-induced crash of March 2020 and the steepest on record.  The number of active contracts, or open interest, on the CME has surged by nearly 37% to 93,000 BTC this month alongside an increase in discount, suggesting an influx of new money on the short side.  ""The futures discount signals severe negative sentiment among multi-asset investors that tend to carve out a small trading allocation towards CME listed cryptocurrency futures,"" Markus Thielen, head of research and strategy at crypto services provider Matrixport, said.  Institutions' renewed bearish stance comes amid fears that the recent collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, formerly the third-largest platform, will prolong the crypto winter.  Griffin Blofin, a volatility trader from the crypto asset management firm Blofin, said the discount on the CME has been more significant than unregulated exchanges like Deribit and the situation may persist going forward.  ""Due to their generally cautious style, institutions will cut most high-risk exposures as fast as they can, causing a higher discount rate than other exchanges such as Deribit,"" Blofin said.  At press time, monthly futures on Deribit traded at an annualized discount of 13.675%, while those on CME traded at 11%.  Arbitrage opportunity?  The price discrepancy between spot and futures markets often attracts arbitrageurs – traders setting up market-neutral positions to profit from an eventual narrowing of futures premium/discount.  In case of discount, arbitrageurs set up reverse cash-and-carry strategy, as observed following the March 2020 crash. The strategy involves setting up a direction-neutral position by borrowing and selling the asset in the spot market and purchasing a futures contract. That helps traders lock in the discount as profit while bypassing directional risks and the strategy makes money as the discount narrows.  According to Thielen, the arbitrage window offered by bitcoin's futures discount could be short-lived.  ""In light of the better macro environment, this arbitrage opportunity will likely close in the near term as the macro environment appears to improve with 1) the USD might have peaked as US interest rate expectations are plateauing, 2) the Ukraine war appears to run out of steam and 3) China takes incremental steps of re-opening,"" Thielen told CoinDesk.  The return from the strategy is limited to the extent of the discount at the time of setting up the trade adjusted for the cost incurred to borrow bitcoin. In other words, the strategy will make money only if the trader can borrow BTC at rates lower than the discount.  Besides, the strategy is not without risks and may not be profitable if the sentiment fails to improve, keeping futures at a discount relative to the spot price.  ""For the reverse cash and carry trade, unless the market can quickly emerge from the shadow of FTX's bankruptcy, investors entering now are likely to be unprofitable, for the basis does not show signs of a significant return to the normal level,"" Ardern said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/16/institutions-return-to-bitcoin-market-but-on-the-bearish-side-steep-discount-in-cme-futures-indicates,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9b4c0ab07cb89bd80828eee5bb4fd1edf521daed-1508x1151.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42422015,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOGN,1668590710,FTX’s Bahamas Arm Files for Bankruptcy Protection in US,"FTX Digital Markets, the Bahamas arm of the now-defunct crypto exchange, has filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy proceedings in the Southern District of New York.  The document, registered late Tuesday night, follows the appointment of insolvency liquidators in the Bahamas earlier that day, and an equivalent case for the exchange’s U.S. arm, FTX.us, which was filed last Friday.  The procedure is intended to allow for an orderly wind-up of cross-border enterprises so that funds can be returned to creditors as fully as possible – potentially including the site's many regular users.  The pleadings essentially argue that U.S. courts should recognize the Bahamas legal proceedings, allowing other legal claims by creditors to be paused. Under the U.S. bankruptcy code, other parties have three weeks to object before the court makes its decision.  While the Bahamas arm, FTX.com, was supposedly separate from the U.S. market, lawyers argue there’s a link to the U.S. via a client account which held $15,000 at the Holland and Knight law firm in New York.  ""It is unclear whether FTX Digital [Markets] has any property in Delaware,"" the filing on behalf of the company said, in a remark likely to raise further questions about the organization's complex structure.  As the U.S. business winds up, data from secondary markets suggest that creditors can expect to receive only 8-12 cents on the dollar for their claims on the collapsed company.  FTX has collapsed in a matter of days, following CoinDesk revelations that the line supposedly separating it from trading arm Alameda Research was blurred.

42422011,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLO87,1668590472,Coinbase: FTX’s Collapse Will Likely Lead to an Extended Crypto Winter,"The collapse of crypto exchange FTX derailed an emerging positive situation in cryptocurrency markets after the significant deleveraging of May and June left few, if any large, marginal sellers in the digital assets space, Coinbase (COIN) said in a research report Tuesday.  The new turbulence in the cryptocurrency market and the lack of large buyers has left the sector vulnerable, potentially extending what was an already long crypto winter, analysts David Duong and Brian Cubellis wrote.  FTX bankruptcy proceedings will be closely watched, but for the digital assets sector, a lot still depends on the path of interest rates in the U.S, the report said.  The market is highly likely to see “second order effects” arising from the unraveling of FTX, as it emerges which counterparties have lent or interacted with either the exchange or its sister company, Alameda Research, and what those exact liabilities are, the note said.  Coinbase says poor liquidity could last till at least the end of the year, noting that stablecoin dominance has risen to a very high 18% of the total crypto market cap, which itself has dropped to around $800 billion as of Nov. 12 from about $1 trillion at the end of last month. Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.  “The combination of increasing hashrate (pushing up the difficulty as a result), rising energy costs and now weaker bitcoin prices has led to increasingly stressed economic conditions for bitcoin miners,” the note said. Hashrate is a measure of computing power devoted to mining bitcoin, and as the hashrate increases, so does the difficulty of producing the cryptocurrency.  FTX’s demise has undoubtedly damaged investor confidence in the sector and remediation will take some time, potentially extending the crypto winter by several more months, perhaps through to the end of 2023, the note added.

However, on November 12, the cryptocurrency experienced a severe price correction that pulled it all the way down to $12.51. The following day, the altcoin made an immediate bounce-back as it reclaimed the $15 marker. After that, Avalanche was once again on a downward trend that made it struggle to even just climb at $14. At the time of this writing, according to tracking from Coingecko, the 20th ranked digital currency in terms of market capitalization is changing hands at $13.50. Over the last seven days, the asset has declined by more than 15% while during the past 30 days, its value dropped by 14.4%. As it turns out, even an impressive growth in GameFi segment of the blockchain space is not enough to stop the bleeding for AVAX. Related Reading: Solana Loses 60% Of Its Value After FTX Collapse – Can SOL Bounce Back This Week? As Crypto Market Suffers, Avalanche Notches Growth Elsewhere According to data shared on Twitter by Avalanche Talk, 10 GameFi projects running on the AVAX blockchain tallied significant increases in volume over the past week. Province was the top gainer, posting an impressive 1,481.77% increase in volume in just a matter of seven days. Owloper (290.98%) was at second. Rounding up the top five were Dragon Crypto (279.76%), Hoppers Game (118.39%) and Step App (91.87%). Meanwhile, RaceX (68.42%), Crabada (44.02%), XANA Metaverse (43.38%), Domi Online (41.42%) and BetSwirl (7.77%) also made the top 10-list of the indicator which aims to show how well a project is performing in a particular ecosystem. TOP AVALANCHE GAMEFI WITH HIGHEST GROWING VOLUME 7D#GrowingVolume7D is an indicator of how well a project is performing across an ecosystem. Right now, let’s take a look at the #Avalanche gamefi projects with the highest growing volume in the last 7 days 👇#Avax $Avax pic.twitter.com/yfFJDG70JN — Avalanche Talk (@Avalanche_Talk) November 14, 2022 Although there is a glaring gap between the increase in volume recorded by the top and least gainer, the most important takeaway is that despite the crypto market being painted in red once again, these projects under the umbrella of the Avalanche ecosystem managed to perform relatively well. This also served as a confirmation of the notion that the GameFi segment of the vast blockchain industry has already started its rapid growth. No Immediate Impact Yet On AVAX Price Much like the case of the Shiba Eternity game that was launched in hopes of helping Shiba Inu push its trading price to higher levels, these games running on the Avalanche network currently has little to no effect at all in terms of price trajectory. The reason for this is that all of these games, and the GameFi segment in its entirety, is still too young to push demands for crypto assets in levels high enough to move an asset’s (in this case AVAX’s) spot trading prices up. Still, this could prove to be a solid foundation that could help Avalanche and its AVAX token soar to greater heights in the near future.

If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s a move we have seen before in recent months with other bankruptcies. Most cryptocurrency values have been down significantly in the past five days. Bitcoin is down 20%, Ethereum 24% and Solana 54%. We believe there is still great potential in crypto and, as anyone who follows us will know, blockchain more broadly. By Mirva Anttila What Happened with FTX Rumors began circulating starting the week of November 1 that the balance sheet of Alameda Research, a quantitative trading firm and a sister company of FTX ( FTT-USD ), a Bahamas-based offshore crypto exchange, might be in trouble. They both have the same owner, a 30-year-old crypto “golden boy,” Sam Bankman-Fried (widely known as “SBF”). It now appears FTX might have lent out customer funds and assets (no proof of this, though) to Alameda Research, which made risky bets with those assets. This is strictly prohibited in traditional finance. Both companies are private, but the market estimates that 40% of the balance sheet of Alameda Research might comprise FTT tokens, utility tokens created by FTX, and these were used as collateral at the firm. The CEO of Binance ( BNB-USD ), Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, got wind of this in the week of November 1 and said over the following weekend that Binance would sell all of its FTT tokens (worth more than $500 million). This created the cascade of events we are witnessing and a “bank run” on FTX. On Tuesday, November 8, Binance and FTX agreed on a letter of intent whereby Binance might potentially purchase FTX Global (leaving FTX US intact), but after starting due diligence, Binance concluded that the finance gap at FTX is “too big” and withdrew the offer. From the on-chain activity, the industry has recently observed money transfers from wallets at Alameda to FTX. It appears that Alameda lost money on its trades and cannot pay back the funds and assets borrowed from FTX. FTX has been reported to have a shortfall of at least $8 billion. Current Situation After Binance’s withdrawal of its offer to take over FTX, the question was, who would be big enough to fill the finance gap at FTX? In the traditional finance industry, the government might bail out the troubled company, but there is no government backstop in crypto. Coinbase ( COIN ) has ruled itself out. After Binance, there were rumors that Tron ( TRX-USD ) cryptocurrency network’s Justin Sun was working with FTX to put together a $9.4 billion “solution.” Several investment funds and companies had access to FTX’s data room and were reviewing its books. Just a short while ago, on Friday (November 11), FTX filed for bankruptcy. Reputation of SBF Apart from the shadiness of potentially using client funds to make risky bets, there are questions about what the customers and investors of FTX actually knew or were told. Were they given full and honest information about what was going on? FTX was valued at $32 billion in January, and blue-chip VCs had completed due diligence on the company. If it misled investors and clients, a court case could come for SBF. It is understood that the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are investigating whether FTX properly handled customer funds and its relationship with other parts of Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire, including his trading house Alameda Research. It is also understood that officials from the Justice Department are working with SEC attorneys. What Changes Are Needed in the Industry The allegations against FTX are that it lent out customer assets for risky activities. If this sounds familiar, it’s because it’s a move we have seen before in recent months with other bankruptcies. The FTX incident is amplified by its size, the characters involved, the alleged self-dealing and the, as of now, unclear legal implications. Clearly, the business model of lending customer assets without their knowledge or understanding has real risks. At WisdomTree, we believe the published proof of reserves and due diligence of service providers, such as custodians, are important in this nascent space. Should customers want to earn yield by lending assets, this should be a conscious decision and known risk that they take. Using utility tokens as collateral, particularly utility tokens created by a firm that is also accepting them as collateral, is highly risky, as they are vulnerable to short attacks. The other question is: how can you use “Monopoly money” you created yourself and claim it could be used as collateral and a replacement for real money? Contagion Fears Most cryptocurrency values have been down significantly in the past five days. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) is down 20%, Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) 24% and Solana ( SOL-USD ) 54%. Solana is down more than others because Alameda Research was one of the early initial coin-offering investors in Solana in 2021, and Alameda is said to have held staked and unstaked Solana worth billions of USD. We expect contagion to continue for days/weeks. Several investors have already written down the investment at FTX to zero. The most obvious companies to track are the lenders to Alameda Research, clients of FTX and other companies with direct or indirect exposures to FTX, Alameda Research or FTT tokens. At this point, we do not have enough information to judge how much, if any, could be salvaged from the bankrupt FTX and its sister company Alameda Research. Future of Crypto We believe there is still great potential in crypto and, as anyone who follows us will know, blockchain more broadly. The early stages of most new technological developments are prone to problems, hiccups and setbacks; however, these recent issues have been business model and risk management failures as opposed to technological issues. Blockchain or bitcoin didn’t “break.” The underlying technology generally performed as intended. Instead, the centralized platforms, some offshore and lightly regulated, precipitated the issues. Some fundamental changes at businesses are needed to make the industry more transparent and trustworthy with less dependence on a few players.

4302040,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508695,1668578784,Solana Loses 60% Of Its Value After FTX Collapse – Can SOL Bounce Back This Week?,"The Solana (SOL) ecosystem, according to Laguna Labs Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Stefan Rust, took a harder hit compared to other major digital coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum following the collapse of the FTX crypto exchange. Here’s a quick glance at SOL performance: Following the collapse of FTX, Solana lost almost 60% of its market value SOL has gone up by 2% over the last 24 hours, trading above the $14 marker Solana coins deposited on blockchain decreased sharply, from 68 million in June to just almost 25 million now “In the current crypto shakeout, the most unfortunate innocent victim is the Solana ecosystem,” Rust said. The CEO noted that the network’s native token, SOL, dropped by nearly 60% since FTX collapsed. In comparison, Bitcoin fell by 19% and Ethereum went down by almost 20%. Rust and other crypto players have reasons to believe that FTX and its trading firm Alameda Research sold large quantity of Solana crypto to mitigate its losses and stay afloat, affecting the cryptocurrency and its trading price. Whether the altcoin can make a comeback during the next few days or not, it’s anyone’s guess up to this time especially that its technical indicators are considered underwhelming from the bulls’ perspective. How Solana Is Performing And Where It’s Headed After dipping all the way down to $12.07, SOL mounted a recovery of its own, going up by 2% over the last 24 hours to trade at $14.21 at the time of this writing according to tracking from Coingecko. Related Reading: Chiliz Bulls Remain Watchful As CHZ Feeling Bearish Impulse Source: TradingView Over the last seven days, the crypto asset’s price action has twice indicated the formation of a bullish block that was supposed to be an encouraging sign for its investors. The first was in November 10 when Solana swung between the narrow range of $18.3 and $12.35, establishing the mid-point of $15.33 as a crucial support and resistance zone. The second instance was in November 14 when the altcoin ignored its lower timeframe bearish structure as it climbed all the way up to $14.43, flipping its bias to bullish. With this, traders and investors looking to take profit should put their focus in the $13 to $13.25 region as an optimal entry point although it is not without risks as the asset continues to struggle right now. Its Relative Strength Index (RSI) settled at the 50-55 score region, indicating that SOL volatility could easily ruin any plans for long trade set-up. Image: Altcoin Buzz Investors And App Developers Leaving Solana In the aftermath of the FTX implosion and the negative effects it had on the crypto asset’s ecosystem, app developers and investors appeared to have abandoned the sinking ship. According to data from DeFiLlama, the current number of Solana coins deposited in the blockchain that is widely used for decentralized finance applications stands at 24.74 million. The number is substantially lower than the 68.2 million tally that was recorded back in June. In light of this development, co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko allayed the fears of investors, saying Solana Labs didn’t have any assets deposited on FTX and as far as financial stability, under its current condition, it will be good for business for the next 30 months. Meanwhile, Raj Gokal, another co-founder of the company, also expressed his sentiments, saying this is a crucible for Solana which will make it even stronger in the future.

FTX is left to themselves as other firms cannot assist due to the magnitude of debts incurred by the exchange. Binance initially intended to help but later acknowledged that the situation was beyond its power. Meanwhile, the latest reports have revealed that the embattled crypto firm has filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. The FTX crisis has plunged many crypto firms into debt and losses, including Huobi’s subsidiary, Hbit Limited. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Strength As Price Holds Above $16,500; Is This A Bear Trap? Hbit Limited revealed in an official announcement that it failed to withdraw $18.1 million worth of assets deposited on FTX. According to the announcement, $13.2 million out of the total value stuck on FTX belongs to Hbit’s clients. This is because the firm deposited the assets on FTX as per clients’ trading requests. The remaining $ 4.9 million belongs to Hbit Limited. However, the firm announced that it would seek legal assistance and follow the necessary steps to recover the assets from the collapsed crypto exchange. Impending Financial Crisis For Hbit According to Hbit’s announcement, the issue may negatively impact its financial performance if not resolved accordingly. However, it revealed that the incident does not affect other business operations of Huobi Group since Hbit is a separate entity. Therefore, different lines of business of the group will continue their everyday operations. Contagion fears from the FTX collapse have spread to other crypto exchanges as the majority are experiencing increased selling pressure. Crypto.Com is one of the crypto exchanges facing such challenges. CRO, the native token of Crypto.com, is down by 45% after suffering a massive sell-off since the FTX fiasco. It started with rumors that the crypto exchange might be a victim of the ongoing liquidity crunch. But the CEO of Crypto.Com, Kris Marszalek, dismissed the rumors, claiming they recovered $990 million from FTX. Marszalek assured users that Crypto.Com maintains a strong balance sheet. He added that his firm’s exposure to the newly collapsed exchange is at most $10 million. Update On The FTX Crisis According to the FTX bankruptcy filing, the exchange valued its assets between $10 and $50 billion. It also listed over 130 affiliate companies around the world. Many affiliated companies joined in the bankruptcy filing in Delaware on Friday. The FTX crisis brought a sudden turn of events for Sam Bankman-Fried, who helped some crypto firms out of their financial trouble earlier this year. Meanwhile, on Saturday, FTX confirmed that there was an unauthorized access to its accounts a few hours after the bankruptcy filing.

If the bulls fail to protect the $1,170 support, there is a risk of a major decline. In the stated scenario, the price could decline towards the $1,100 support zone in the near term.

The Bankman-Fried-led crypto empire hailed as an industry leader has filed for bankruptcy, creating widespread panic in crypto circles. This collapse was aided by Ian Allison’s article showing that around $5.8 billion from the $14.6 billion assets of Almeda Research were tied to FTX’s exchange token FTT.

This is because Crypto markets have become a bit more settled recently. The crypto market’s total capitalization also increased, with figures up to $880 billion. The crypto market has featured massive uncertainty. Recently, crypto investors have had low trust in crypto investing due to failed projects. However, the gains recorded in BTC signaled a massive relief to investors in recent days. Bitcoin Holders Become Cautious According to Glassnode reports, major crypto exchanges record a massive decline in their total BTC balance. A shortage of 73,000 BTC; was recorded by exchanges in one week. Ethereum also recorded a similar decline on exchanges, with a massive 1.1 million ETH in the past week.

Most stablecoins have been liquidated to increase dollar liquidity, using smart contracts at a monthly rate of $4.63 billion. A Recap On FTX Crash Investors had been wary of the relationship between FTX and Almeda Research since they were both founded by Bankman-Fried. It is alleged that FTX lent up to $10 billion to Almeda. These funds were used without the knowledge of investors. This signaled one of the largest misappropriation of funds in history. This shocking revelation was the last straw that led to a sudden exodus of investors from FTX – the world’s second-largest exchange. Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, after this revelation, decided to withdraw his entire FTT holdings leading to widespread market chaos. FTX crypto exchange handled $6 billion worth of withdrawals in just 72 hours. The downslide continued amid fears that FTX had transferred funds under the radar to Almeda as a loan to cushion losses. Rival exchange Binance founder Changpeng Zhao had earlier declared interest in acquiring FTX. However, the deal is now off. The suspension was based on irregularities in the company’s financial standings. Related Reading: Bitcoin Shows Strength As Price Holds Above $16,500; Is This A Bear Trap?

What's noteworthy about the most recent crash in crypto markets – triggered by the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange and his trading firm Alameda Research – is just how divergent the narrative was from traditional markets. That's noteworthy, since bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency, was largely trading in sync with U.S. stocks as recently as September.  The market contagion from FTX spread rapidly in crypto, sending the 162-asset CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) down about 18% so far in November.  And despite widespread headlines about the FTX-inflicted turmoil across traditional financial media, U.S. stocks were mostly unfazed – trading higher based on softer-than-expected inflation readings that inspired investor hopes of a less threatening monetary-tightening campaign by the Federal Reserve.  The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is up 3.1% on the month.  An analysis of CMI and its six sector indexes shows how correlations surged among the various digital assets from Nov. 7 to Nov. 11.

The price is trading above $16,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $16,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a recovery wave if it clears the $17,000 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Consolidates Bitcoin price remained stable above the $16,000 support zone. BTC formed a base and slowly moved higher above the $16,350 resistance zone. There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $18,155 swing high to $15,833 low. The bulls were able to contain losses and the price started to move in a range above the $16,400 level. Bitcoin price is now trading above $16,500 and the 100 hourly simple moving average, similar to ethereum. On the upside, an immediate resistance is near the $16,900 level. There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance near $16,900 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The trend line is near the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $18,155 swing high to $15,833 low. The first major resistance is near the $17,000 zone.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin, Ether Inch Upward  By James Rubin  Bitcoin showed its mettle for a second consecutive day, inching upward even as the post FTX crypto world was falling apart.  Investors bit into encouraging inflation data – a Labor Department report, showing supplier pricing (PPI) arriving cooler than expected – to keep the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization above $16,750, a gain of about 1% over the past 24 hours. BTC has been inching up since Monday even as fallout from crypto exchange FTX’s liquidity crisis and filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection widens. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that crypto lender BlockFi is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing because of its ""significant exposure"" to FTX.  This article was adapted from Market Wrap, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter diving into what happened in today's crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  “Bitcoin is showing resilience here but it is hard to imagine investors are ready to test the waters until we learn more of the full contagion risk associated with FTX,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda wrote, although he warned that “if more exchanges or crypto companies pause withdrawals or limit activity, that will likely bring back the pressure on cryptos.”  Ether was recently changing hands at about $1,250, up about 1% from Monday, same time. Other major altcoins spent much of Tuesday in the green with even FTX's FTT token climbing 20%. FTT was, nevertheless, recently trading at $1.81, a fraction of its near $36 highs earlier this year. SRM, another FTX-related casualty that had slumped more than 72% over the weekend, rose more than 3%. DeFi protocols across the Solana ecosystem unplugged from Serum's onchain exchange in recent days for fear that they didn't know who held control. FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was a major supporter of Serum.  The CoinDesk Market Index, a broad-based index designed to measure the market capitalization weighted performance of the digital asset market, was about flat.  Equity markets rose slightly, buoyed by October's PPI, indicating that U.S. central bank monetary policies were staunching inflation. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.4%, while the S&P 500, which has a strong tech component, and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbed 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively.  Oanda’s Moya noted warily that a possible BlockFi bankruptcy could present crypto markets with their next big test. The lender denied rumors that a majority of its assets were held at FTX, but acknowledged on Monday that in addition to having deposits on the platform, it had an undrawn line of credit from FTX and obligations that FTX owed it.  “The next domino to fall appears to be BlockFi,” Moya wrote. “Contagion from FTX was widely expected to impact BlockFi despite their recent denial that a majority of their assets are custodied at collapsed crypto exchange FTX.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Loopring LRC +7.2% Smart Contract Platform Terra LUNA +2.8% Smart Contract Platform Cardano ADA +2.6% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA −1.7% Entertainment  Insights  Will FTX's Collapse Change Hong Kong's Approach to Retail Crypto Regulation?  By Sam Reynolds  FTX’s epic collapse comes at an awkward time for retail crypto traders in Hong Kong. In late October, only days before the current catastrophe unfolded, the Hong Kong government announced its ambitions to be a crypto hub once again and was considering relaxing the prohibition on retail crypto trading.  “The SFC has been actively looking to set up a regime to authorize ETFs [that] provide exposure to mainstream virtual assets with appropriate investment guardrails,” Securities and Futures Commission Deputy Chief Executive Officer Julia Leung said at Hong Kong FinTech Week, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Hong Kong Monetary Authority CEO Eddie Yue added that these new technologies could “develop very nicely in a healthy financial system like Hong Kong” with the right regulation.  But Hong Kong’s authorities didn’t announce specific regulations. That’s going to come after a consultation period with the regulators themselves and industry stakeholders.  Now, how do you think these conversations will go after the news broke that FTX has one million creditors in its bankruptcy proceedings? Local exchange AAX also is on the brink of failure, suspending operations until a new capital raise can be secured.  Some of the million creditors cited in FTX’s bankruptcy will include hedge funds, institutional investors, or crypto entities – but some will also include retail investors, including Hong Kongers. If AAX goes under, who knows how many retail traders in HK will also be affected.  The outcome of this will be a strict set of rules for the retail trading industry. There will be limitations on how the exchange operates. Some of them might be for the better, like the required use of licensed custodians, but some of them might deter traders, such as limitations on what tokens are available.  Hong Kong regulators will certainly be cognizant of the risks of having overly strict regulations: The exchanges will be ghost towns and people will continue to trade offshore. But any regulator knows that regulation is a balancing act. Let’s see what the outcome is – if Hong Kong still wants to have retail crypto trading, that is.

42422026,k5ee0ftw5HzexjTwoLLOd5,1668562000,"After Bankruptcy, FTX User Claims Pay Cents on the Dollar","Damaged depositors to the embattled crypto exchange FTX, who face an uphill court battle to recover at least some of their hostaged funds, can sell their credit claims, but they’ll retrieve only a fraction of their holdings.  Cherokee Acquisition, a distressed asset investment firm that also has a marketplace for credit claims against bankrupt firms, put a guide price of 8 to 12 cents on a dollar for FTX users' deposit claims over $100,000 in the latest price table sent out Tuesday.  When a firm files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as FTX did last Friday or declares bankruptcy, creditors who choose not to wait until the resolution of a lengthy bankruptcy proceeding to recover some or all their assets may sell their credit claims to distressed asset investment companies.  The relatively low prices for FTX claims suggest that the probability for FTX users to reclaim their funds is diminished.  By comparison, Earn account holders of bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network may receive around 20 cents on a dollar after selling their claims, while creditors of Voyager Digital, the crypto brokerage platform that was auctioned off to FTX, may recover 40 cents on a dollar for their claims.  Even this depressed price tag might turn out to be too high for potential buyers, Thomas Braziel, managing partner at distressed corporate specialist 507 Capital, told CoinDesk.  “No one is buying them” at that price, he said. A more realistic market price for deposit claims, he argued, would be closer to 3 to 5 cents.  FTX, part of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto conglomerate of more than 130 firms, filed for bankruptcy protection Friday after it illegally used customer deposits for lending and investing and a bank run uncovered a $10 billion hole in its balance sheet.

When asking who will be next, MicroStrategy comes to mind. The exposure that Silvergate has to these players makes this a tipping point. I have been highly bullish on Silvergate ( SI ). I see the company as a regulatory play on the Bitcoin ecosystem, a way to get exposure to Bitcoin without being overtly dependent on Bitcoin's (BTC-USD) price direction. The company takes advantage of the Bitcoin adoption trend by getting zero-cost funding from institutions using the SEN network. Silvergate then applies those funds to high-quality assets (mostly mortgage securities, 97% AA- or higher). However, one of the biggest growth drivers is a Bitcoin collateralized lending product that allows its clients to use their Bitcoin as a guarantee for funding, the SEN leverage lending. Here is where the cracks are starting to appear. The company publicly disclosed a margin loan to MacroStrategy, an entity owned by MicroStrategy ( MSTR ). Let us see how this might unfold. Crypto domino Right now, a crypto domino of bankruptcies is unfolding as we speak. It started with Luna's (LUNC-USD) downfall (the algo stablecoin), then spilled to 3AC (the crypto venture capital fund) that was highly leveraged, and ended with the fall of the likes of Voyager (VYGVQ) and BlockFi. We thought the effect had stopped when Sam Bankman-Fried appeared in a white horse, buying some of the troubled assets. However, FTX's downfall is now raising concerns around the whole crypto space, and it reignited the domino effect. The million-dollar question is who's next? At this point, one big contender is MicroStrategy. The company levered significantly to purchase Bitcoin during the last two years. While the first acquisition is still below the current price, the following cost more than Bitcoin is worth now. MicroStrategy Bitcoin Buying (Twitter: @Elementcapl) In other words, from the public info, we can estimate that the company has bought close to $4 billion in Bitcoin at an average cost of around $30,000. At the current market price of $16,000, the unrealized losses are close to 50% of the total position. The company might be able to cover the margin loan collateral and keep servicing the loans until the first maturity arises, and it might survive, but it has put itself into a tough spot. Obviously, the current problems won't stop with MicroStrategy. That is just one of the best-known names in the industry. Others will likely fall too. Players used credit in illiquid markets, but importantly, they used leverage in a highly volatile asset like Bitcoin. Ironically, in prior bankruptcies (like 3AC), it seems that lenders using smartcontracts in crypto platforms automatically recouped their loans. However, in those cases, the lending done through traditional financing will have to wait for the bankruptcy courts to try to get something back. Impacts of the crypto domino on Silvergate The most direct will be the ability to keep MicroStrategy's margin loan out of losses. The loan has plenty of collateral, and it is likely to be recoverable in its entirety. However, the uncertainty is higher than ever. Not losing money in these SEN leverage loans will serve as a proof-of-concept for the whole business model. According to the company's financial info, Silvergate has 9% of its balance sheet in direct loans: Silvergate Asset Alocation (Silvergate) Of which around $300 million are SEN Leverage loans. Loan Portfolio (Silvergate) Conclusion However, even if Silvergate does not lose any money in the loans, it won't get away unscratched. They will lose customers in the SEN. FTX will be gone, and rumors are now circling about Crypto.com (CRO-USD) also facing a run. Silvergate issued a statement saying that the relation with FTX is limited to deposits, corresponding to less than 10% of 11.2 billion total deposits. SEN (Silvergate) Silvergate has traditionally avoided using its whole crypto deposits in its business. If this conservative approach reveals effective, that will be good for the company in the current turmoil. Nevertheless, the market is reading this as a weakness and downgrading the growth perspective for the company. The current market multiple is already recognizing lower growth and some loss recognition with a P/BV lower than one (stock price: $34.32). If the company is able to hold ground and avoid major losses on its loans, it validates the current management strategy, and it might be an attractive entry point. However, the uncertainty has never been higher due to the multiple unforeseeable effects that the crypto downfall of several relevant companies might bring. The present context is a huge stress test for Silvergate's management strategy and execution. The balance sheet reveals what seems to be a somewhat contained exposure. However, the growth strategy is heavily dependent not on the Bitcoin price but on the thriving of the crypto ecosystem, and the falling domino will be a major headwind. Provided that the company avoids losses and the crypto industry can regrow, I think that Silvergate will be a good investment. But, both hypotheses will be battle-tested during the next few months.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4558207-silvergate-will-be-tested-crypto-bloodbath?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/4293026.jpeg
