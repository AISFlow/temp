This is bullish for the flagship crypto, considering what happened last year when the fractal pattern formed. Bitcoin Prices Flashes Fractal Similar To October 2023 TradingShot mentioned in a TradingView post that the Bitcoin fractal similar to the one that occurred in October 2023 is happening again. He explained that the similarities are more evident in the 1D timeframe, where the Bitcoin price currently ranges within the 1D 50-day moving average (MA) and the 1D 200 MA. According to him, BTC also traded similarly precisely a year ago in the first two weeks of October 2023. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle In October 2023, BTC is said to have made a marginal break above the 1D 200 MA before quickly pulling back below it. TradingShot further revealed that the Bitcoin price started its “long-term aggressive rally” of the Channel Up after it tested and held the 1D 50 MA, peaking on March 14 this year, when it hit its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin tested and held this 1D 50 MA at the start of this month, indicating another long-term aggressive rally might be on the horizon. TradingShot claimed that as long as the 1-week 50 MA continues to hold as the long-term support, there is a high probability that the Bitcoin price could hit $100,000 even before the end of this year. From a fundamentals angle, market experts like Standard Chartered have also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 even before the US presidential elections on November 5. Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts expect BTC to at least come close to this price level based on their prediction that the flagship crypto could hit $90,000 if Donald Trump wins the elections. What Next For The Leading Crypto? The Bitcoin price has remained stagnant amid market uncertainty thanks to the macro data, the upcoming US elections and rising tensions in the Middle East. This has raised questions about what to expect next from the leading crypto with such a bearish outlook. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided some insights, predicting that BTC could soon lose the $60,000 support level. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens While noting that Bitcoin remains stuck in a descending parallel channel, Martinez remarked that a recent rejection of the upper bounder could lead to a decline to the middle boundary at $58,000. He added that the BTC price could drop to the lower boundary at $52,000. According to him, a bullish breakout for Bitcoin won’t happen until its price clears $66,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $61,000, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Currently trading at $2,392, Ethereum is down 1.5% in the past 24 hours, adding to its gradual decline in recent days. This drop follows a brief price surge last week, where Ethereum saw a slight surge to above $2,600. Despite the minor increase, Ethereum remains down by 51% from its all-time high of $4,878, recorded in 2021. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Retests $2,350: Is a Bounce In The Cards? Ethereum Potential To Fall 53% The sideways movement in Ethereum’s price has left traders cautious. Amid this, renowned crypto analyst Ali has offered his perspective on Ethereum’s current trajectory in a recent post on X. Ali pointed out that Ethereum’s price action tends to follow a particular pattern based on TD Sequential indicators. He explained that whenever Ethereum breaks above the TD setup resistance trendline, a strong bull run often ensues. However, when Ethereum dips below the TD setup support trendline, it typically results in a significant price correction. According to Ali, Ethereum is nearing a critical support level of $2,250, warning that if this support is breached, it could trigger a major price drop. Ali further emphasized that ETH has previously seen an average of 53% corrections following similar breakdowns, suggesting that losing the $2,250 level could spell trouble for the cryptocurrency. Each time #Ethereum breaks above the TD setup resistance trendline 🔴, a strong bull run follows. But when $ETH breaks below the TD setup support trendline 🟢, we’ve seen an average 53% correction. The key support now is $2,250—losing it could trigger a significant price drop. pic.twitter.com/PljkRda78S — Ali (@ali_charts) October 10, 2024 On The Flip Side While Ali expresses concern over Ethereum’s potential for a significant downturn, other analysts remain optimistic about its long-term potential. A crypto analyst going by the name EtherNasYoNAL on X recently shared a bullish outlook for ETH, suggesting that the cryptocurrency could be on the verge of entering a new “mega bull” cycle. According to the analyst, ETH is currently in the final stages of what they describe as a “retest and accumulation process.” This phase is reminiscent of Ethereum’s price movements in 2020, where it underwent a similar process before the 2021 mega bull run. The analyst added that Ethereum’s price action in the months of August, September, and October 2020 followed a specific pattern, with accumulation and retests before the asset saw a significant rise. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens EtherNasYoNAL believes Ethereum is currently mirroring this process and is poised to enter another mega bull cycle, expected to occur around 2025. Despite the current decline, the analyst remains confident that Ethereum’s long-term trajectory is still bullish, encouraging investors to remain patient and await the expected price surge. #Ethereum winks at the 2025 mega bull!

34547629,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647292,1728594055,Dogecoin Could Break Yearly Highs ‘Any Moment Now’ – Crypto Analyst,"Dogecoin is currently testing a crucial demand level after experiencing a 23% decline from its local highs of $0.13. As the meme coin navigates this turning point, the broader crypto market anticipates a potential rally in the coming weeks, driven by the Federal Reserve’s recent decision to cut interest rates. However, October kicked off with increased selling pressure, leaving investors searching for signs of strength in Dogecoin’s price action. Related Reading: Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst Top analyst Mister Crypto has shared a bullish outlook, stating that Dogecoin could begin its next rally “any time now.” His technical analysis highlights key support levels and suggests that the current price could be a launchpad for significant upside movement. Despite the recent dip, many traders remain optimistic that DOGE could soon recover and enter a new bullish phase. All eyes are now on whether Dogecoin can hold its critical demand level and break out shortly. Dogecoin Testing Crucial Demand Dogecoin is currently surrounded by speculation as investors and analysts offer varying opinions on its future price action. After several weeks of significant ups and downs, the meme coin has seen massive volatility, reflecting the broader market’s uncertainty. Some analysts remain optimistic about Dogecoin’s prospects, while others caution against getting too bullish too soon. A technical analysis shared by prominent analyst Mister Crypto on X suggests a potentially bullish scenario for DOGE. His analysis highlights a 4-day (4D) price chart, where a bullish triangle pattern has just been broken. This breakout signals a possible rally ahead, which, if realized, could lead to gains exceeding 100%. Mister Crypto’s forecast has sparked renewed hope among Dogecoin traders, who are now carefully managing their risk in anticipation of this potential move. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details However, despite the optimism, there is still no clear confirmation that Dogecoin has entered a new bull run. For this bullish scenario to be validated, the price must close above the current demand level and hold support. Until then, the market remains cautious, and investors are waiting for further price action to confirm whether Dogecoin will break out or continue to trade sideways. With so much speculation and uncertainty, the coming days will be critical for DOGE’s trajectory. Price Action: Technical Levels To Hold Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.106 after experiencing an 8% dip since Monday. The price has lost both the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $0.107 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.108, placing DOGE in a precarious position as it now tests crucial demand levels. For bullish momentum to return, DOGE needs to break back above these key indicators and reclaim the $0.12 mark. A surge beyond this level could set the stage for a higher push, giving bulls the control they need to shift market sentiment. However, the current market environment remains fragile, and any failure to recapture the 4-hour MAs could signal further downside. Related Reading: Can SUI Break Past $2 Resistance? On-Chain Metrics Reveal Growing Demand If DOGE fails to hold its current levels, analysts anticipate a deeper correction that could drive the price down to around $0.08, a key support zone. Traders are watching closely to see if DOGE can stabilize or if more downside is ahead. This makes the coming days crucial for determining whether the meme coin can rebound or face further selling pressure.

34546647,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24296,1728590859,What is Nym Tech (NYM)?,"Nym is a decentralised privacy-focused cryptocurrency project that aims to provide digital privacy for everyone in the age of datafication and AI. The core technology behind Nym is its mixnet, a network of decentralised nodes operated by a global community of users. This mixnet works by obscuring data traffic through multiple layers of encryption similarly to how Tor works, making it difficult for third parties to track or trace internet activities. By decentralising its infrastructure, Nym ensures that no single entity can control or exploit the network, preserving user privacy and security without relying on trust in any intermediaries. One of Nym’s key innovations is its tokenised economy, which incentivises node operators to participate in the mixnet. These operators are rewarded with Nym tokens, which helps ensure the economic sustainability of the network. The token system also prevents operators from monetising user data, offering a privacy-first alternative to traditional centralised services where user data is often commodified. This structure supports a long-term, self-sustaining model for the Nym network, aligning financial incentives with privacy goals. Get Started Nym’s commitment to transparency and security is demonstrated by its open-source approach. All of the software developed by Nym is made available to the public for auditing and peer review, ensuring the highest standards of security and trustworthiness. This open-source model invites contributions from a global community of developers and researchers, continuously improving the software and reinforcing its integrity. Anyone can participate in Nym’s ecosystem by running a node or contributing to the project, further decentralising the control and enhancing privacy across the network. The project operates under a strict principle of data minimisation, meaning that the Nym mixnet processes only the data necessary to provide privacy, with no access to sensitive user information. The system is designed to be permissionless and trustless, allowing anyone to use Nym’s software without needing approval from a central authority. This makes Nym a powerful tool for protecting user privacy, enabling individuals to maintain control over their digital footprint in an increasingly monitored and data-driven world. Trade Nym Now What is the NYM Token? The NYM token is a central component of the Nym mixnet, powering its decentralised privacy infrastructure. Designed to protect digital privacy, the token supports a global network that enables fully private packet routing, ensuring that users’ online activities remain shielded from surveillance. By leveraging Nym’s mixnet, packets of data are encrypted and routed through a series of nodes, preventing any third parties from logging, analysing, or intercepting the traffic. This system is resistant to metadata surveillance, making it a robust solution for privacy in an increasingly monitored digital landscape. The economic structure of the Nym network is built around a tokenized incentive system that ensures the sustainability and security of the mixnet. Node operators, who run the mixnet, are rewarded in NYM tokens for their performance. To secure the network, users can stake their tokens by delegating them to node operators, with rewards based on the node’s performance and staked amount. This staking process not only incentivizes participation in the network but also creates a decentralised mechanism for ensuring the continued operation and privacy of the mixnet. Stakers earn rewards in proportion to the size of their stake, contributing to the system’s economic flywheel. NYM tokenomics are designed to align incentives for both mixnet users and node operators. The network currently boasts over 900 active Nym nodes spread across 86 countries, showcasing its global reach and decentralised nature. As users send their data through the mixnet, node operators process these packets while receiving compensation from a mix-mining reward pool. The decentralised, permissionless nature of the system ensures that anyone can participate by either running a node or staking tokens, fostering a truly distributed network that can adapt to growing demand for privacy. In addition to staking, the NYM token can be traded on Bitfinex, which supports both native and ERC-20 NYM tokens. Users can swap between the two forms using the Bitfinex currency conversion tool , maintaining flexibility across different platforms. As the Nym mixnet continues to grow and expand, the NYM token plays a crucial role in supporting the network’s long-term sustainability, providing the economic incentives that keep the system secure and decentralised. With its privacy-first approach and robust tokenomics, the NYM token is positioned at the core of the network’s mission to enable digital privacy for everyone.

Canary Capital, a boutique Sydney investment and corporate advisory firm has just filed an XRP ETF, following Bitwise’s lead. With the new ETF filing, the price of XRP could see a possible change in the future. Canary Capital Files New XRP ETF On Tuesday, October 8, Canary Capital submitted an official S-1 filing for an XRP ETF with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This filing comes just after Bitwise, another top asset management company filed for an ETF on September 30, marking the first ever XRP–based ETF in the crypto market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle According to Canary Capital’s new filing, the Trust’s investment goal is to provide direct exposure to the value of XRP, enabling investors to access this cryptocurrency’s market through a brokerage account. Through this method, Canary Capital intends to limit the potential barriers to accessing the market and reduce the risks involved in acquiring and holding XRP. Canary Capital has also stated that it aims to track the performance of XRP in the market, as measured by the Trust’s Pricing Benchmark. This pricing benchmark will utilize a similar methodology to the real-time price of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) CF Ripple index. While divulging the objectives and risk factors associated with an XRP ETF, Canary Capital failed to disclose the identity of the custodian for its potential XRP ETF. The investment management company also did not provide details on the ticker to be used for its XRP ETF, however, revealed that the Trustee for the investment product would be the Delaware Trust company. Despite the optimism Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF filing has generated in the crypto community, both its application and Bitwise’s still require approval from the SEC before they can launch in the market. Presently, the likelihood of a swift approval appears low, considering Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the regulator. Earlier this month, the US SEC submitted a new appeal to challenge the court’s July 2023 ruling that programmatic sales of XRP are not considered securities. XRP Price Falls As Regulatory Uncertainty Clouds Optimism Despite Canary Capital’s new XRP ETF filing, the price of XRP has been on a downward trend, showing no signs of moving out of bearish momentum trends. CoinMarketCap’s data shows that XRP has fallen by 0.72% in the last 24 hours and another 0.79% over the past week. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Fails At MA-200, Is A Crash To $52,000 Coming?

With the new XRP ETF, many would expect the XRP price to rally, as anticipation for the investment product builds in the crypto space. However, XRP is still consolidating around the $0.5 mark, even experiencing a decrease in its 24-hour trading volume. It is clear that XRP’s bullish momentum has been completely overshadowed by regulatory uncertainty and negative sentiment. Despite this, many in the XRP community continue to maintain a positive outlook, expecting the price of XRP to break out to the upside soon.

Accused Of Trading $2B In Crypto As ‘Unregistered Dealer’ In a statement released on Thursday, the SEC revealed that Chicago-based Cumberland DRW is accused of trading over $2 billion in crypto assets offered and sold as alleged “securities” in violation of federal registration requirements designed to protect investors. The SEC’s complaint alleges that Cumberland has been engaging in these activities since at least March 2018, acting as an “unregistered dealer” by buying and selling crypto assets for its own accounts as part of its regular business operations. Related Reading: US Charges 14 Individuals And Four Crypto Companies In Major ‘Sham Trading’ Scandal According to the firm’s website, it provided “deep, reliable liquidity” in crypto assets, as well as investing in technology, claiming to have decades of experience in the field. Cumberland DRW has publicly positioned itself as “one of the world’s leading liquidity providers” in the digital asset market, operating around the clock and executing trades with counterparties via telephone and its online platform, Marea. Cumberland also offered spot cryptocurrency liquidity, and operations for “dozens” of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins, for institutional investors in the market. Other services offered by the company included options and futures trading, bilateral crypto options, and non-deliverable forwards. SEC Seeks Penalties Against Cumberland DRW The SEC further alleges that Cumberland has been trading crypto assets treated as investment contracts on third-party exchanges. Jorge G. Tenreiro, Acting Chief of the SEC’s Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit, stated: The federal securities laws require all dealers in all securities to register with the Commission, and those who operate in the crypto asset markets are no exception. Related Reading: Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat The SEC’s Head Of the digital assets divison noted that despite industry claims equating crypto asset sales to commodity sales, the SEC’s complaint asserts that Cumberland, the issuers, and investors viewed the transactions as investments in securities. Tenreiro further alleged: Cumberland profited from its dealer activity in these assets without providing investors and the market with the important protections afforded by registration. The SEC’s complaint was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and charges Cumberland with violating Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The agency is seeking permanent injunctive relief, recovery of ill-gotten gains, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties against the firm.

42407408,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH4Qg,1728589660,Four Reasons Ether ETFs Have Underperformed,"Spot ether ETFs have failed to attract the same kind of demand as spot bitcoin ETFs.  But that was a tall order, considering how immensely popular the bitcoin products have been.  Headwinds include the lack of staking yield in the ETFs and a difficulty in marketing Ethereum to investors.  For many investors, the performance of spot ether {{ETH}} exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has been disappointing.  Whereas spot bitcoin {{BTC}} ETFs processed almost $19 billion in inflows in the course of 10 months, ether ETFs, which began trading in July, have failed to produce the same kind of interest.  Even worse, Grayscale’s ETHE, which existed as an ether Trust prior to its conversion into an ETF, has suffered massive redemptions, and demand for other ether funds has failed to offset them.  That means ether ETFs have, so far, experienced $556 million in net outflows since they launched. Just this week, the products have bled out a net $8 million, according to Farside data.  So why are ether ETFs performing so differently? There are a few possible reasons.  Putting inflows into context  First of all, it’s important to note that ether ETFs only look bad in contrast to bitcoin ETFs. The bitcoin products have broken so many records that they’re arguably the most successful ETFs of all time.  For example, the ETFs issued by BlackRock and Fidelity, IBIT and FBTC, collected $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion each in their first 30 days, smashing the previous record, held by BlackRock’s Climate Conscious fund, which had garnered $2.2 billion in its first month, August 2023.  While ether ETFs failed to replicate these kinds of earth-shattering results, three of the funds are still among the top 25 best performing ETFs of the year, according to ETF Store president Nate Geraci.  BlackRock’s ETHE, Fidelity’s FBTC, and Bitwise’s ETHW have vacuumed up almost $1 billion, $367 million, and $239 million in assets respectively – not bad at all for two-and-a-half months old funds.  “Spot ether ETFs were never going to challenge spot bitcoin ETFs in terms of inflows,” Geraci told CoinDesk. “If you look at the underlying spot markets, ether is about one-fourth the market cap of bitcoin. That should be a reasonable proxy of where spot ether ETF demand ends up longer-term relative to spot bitcoin ETFs.”  The problem is that Grayscale’s ETHE has drowned out these funds’ performances with its large outflows.  Spun up in 2017 as a trust, ETHE was originally designed, for regulatory reasons, in a way that didn’t permit investors to redeem their ETF shares – the money was stuck in the product. That changed on July 23, when Grayscale won approval to convert its trust into a proper ETF.  At the time of conversion, Grayscale held roughly $10 billion in ether, and while some of those assets were moved by Grayscale from ETHE to another of its funds – the ether mini ETF – ETHE has suffered almost $3 billion in outflows.  It’s worth noting that Grayscale experienced the same thing with its bitcoin ETF, GBTC, which has processed more than $20 billion in outflows since its conversion in January. However, the stellar performances of BlackRock and Fidelity’s spot Bitcoin ETFs have more than offset GBTC’s bleedout.  Lack of staking yield  One of the big differences between bitcoin and ether is that investors can stake ether – essentially locking it into the Ethereum network to earn a yield paid out in ether.  However, in their current form, ether ETFs don’t allow investors to gain exposure to staking. So holding ether through an ETF means missing out on that yield (currently about 3.5%) – and paying a management fee to issuers that can range from 0.15% to 2.5%.  While some traditional investors won’t mind giving up that yield in exchange for the convenience and safety of an ETF, it makes sense for crypto-natives to find alternative ways of holding ether.  “If you're a competent fund manager with even a basic understanding of the crypto market and you're managing someone’s money, why would you buy an ether ETF right now?” Adam Morgan McCarthy, an analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko Research, told CoinDesk.  “You pay to get exposure to ETH (and the underlying is custodied at Coinbase) or you buy the underlying yourself and stake it with the exact same provider in return for some yield,” McCarthy said.  Marketing Ethereum to clients  Another obstacle for ether ETFs is that it can be hard for some investors to understand the core use-case for Ethereum because it seeks to lead in several, diverse areas of crypto.  Bitcoin was created with a hard cap on supply: There will never be more than 21 million bitcoin in existence. That makes it relatively easy for investors to see it as “digital gold” and a potential hedge against inflation.  Explaining why a decentralized, open-source smart contract platform matters – and more importantly, why ether stands to accrue in value – is another task altogether.  “One of the challenges for ether ETFs in penetrating the 60/40 Boomer world is distilling its purpose/value into an easy-to-understand soundbite,” Bloomberg Intelligence ETF analyst Eric Balchunas wrote in May.  McCarthy agreed. “Ether is just that bit more complex to get across to people – it’s not built for an elevator pitch,” he told CoinDesk.  It’s no wonder, then, that crypto index fund Bitwise recently launched an educational ad campaign highlighting the technological benefits of Ethereum.  “As investors learn more about stablecoins, decentralized finance, tokenization, prediction markets, and the many other applications powered by Ethereum, they will enthusiastically embrace both technology and the US-listed Ethereum ETPs,” Zach Pandl, head of research at Grayscale, told CoinDesk.  Poor price performance  There’s also the fact that ETH itself hasn’t performed all that well compared to BTC this year.  The second largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization is only up 4% since Jan. 1, whereas BTC has risen 42% and keeps hovering around its 2021 all-time highs.  “One factor contributing to the success of the bitcoin ETFs, which remain mostly retail-driven, has been investor animal spirits and fear of missing out, which itself was fueled by BTC’s 65% rise into the ETF launch and subsequent 33% gain since,” Brian Rudick, director of research at crypto trading firm GSR, told CoinDesk.  “ETH’s 30% price decline since its ETFs launched has put a large damper on retail enthusiasm to buy the funds,” Rudick added. “Sentiment around Ethereum is low, with some seeing it as stuck between Bitcoin as the best monetary asset and Solana as the best high-performance smart contract blockchain.”  Unattractive valuation  Finally, there’s a possibility that traditional investors simply don’t find ether’s valuation attractive at these levels.  At a market capitalization of roughly $290 billion, ether already has a higher valuation than any bank in the world except for JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which stand at $608 billion and $311 billion respectively.  And while that might seem like an apples-to-oranges comparison, Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk that ether’s valuation also looks high compared to tech stocks.  Ether’s valuation “next to other assets is now uglier because there is no justification for its price on any sort of valuation framework,” Thompson wrote in September. “Either price has to come down, or a new generally accepted valuation framework for the asset needs to be widely accepted.”  Correction (Oct. 11, 2024, 14:10 UTC): Corrects ETHE pre-ETF AUM to $10B.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Tom Carreras,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/10/four-reasons-ether-etfs-have-underperformed,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9684e3f076b4c64ce3e2d4cab1b8e5a118f27308-4032x2268.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407418,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH4np,1728587171,"Bitcoin Tumbles Below $59K Amid Inflation Worry, Regulatory Onslaught on Crypto","Crypto prices are sharply lower on Thursday, led by bitcoin's 4% decline.  A re-acceleration in inflation pressure in September initially sent markets lower.  Declines grew after an SEC lawsuit against digital asset market maker Cumberland DRW.  BTC will likely trade range-bound until the U.S. election, Lekker Capital's Quinn Thompson said in a Telegram interview.  Cryptocurrencies continue to face headwinds on a number of fronts, with Thursday bringing a faster-than-hoped inflation report for September and yet another U.S. government regulatory action against a sector participant.  In mid-afternoon U.S. trading, bitcoin {{BTC}} was lower by about 4% over the past 24 hours. At $59,000, the price has returned to levels not seen since the U.S. Federal Reserve unexpectedly slashed its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in mid-September. Altcoins outperformed somewhat, with the broad-based crypto benchmark CoinDesk 20 Index declining just under 3% during the same period. Ether {{ETH}} dropped 3.5%, while only decentralized exchange Uniswaps's token {{UNI}} had positive return during the day on news about the platform's own layer-2 plans.  Crypto began the day on a weak foot after the U.S. Consumer Price Index report showed an unexpected re-acceleration of inflation in September. The news seemingly drove a stake through any idea that the Fed could cut interest rates another 50 basis points in November, with some market participants now wondering if the U.S. central bank might even decide to pause its rate-cutting cycle at that meeting.  ""Hot CPI and oil price spike due to Middle East tensions have created a fear that the Fed will not cut as much as the market previously thought,"" Quinn Thompson, founder of hedge fund Lekker Capital, said in a Telegram message. ""Mix in [Atlanta Fed President] Bostic's hawkish comments today regarding a potential pause and that's the tinder to run the levered traders' stops.""  Indeed, the sell-off liquidated some $147 million of leveraged long positions betting on higher prices across crypto derivatives markets, CoinGlass data shows.  Prices dived even lower during afternoon hours following news that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued major digital asset market maker Cumberland DRW, raising concerns once again about the challenging regulatory environment for U.S. crypto firms. The SEC alleged DRW traded crypto assets that were sold as securities without registering as a securities dealer.  Cumberland pushed back against the lawsuit in an X post, saying that ""we are not making any changes to our business operations or the assets in which we provide liquidity as a result of this action by the SEC.""  The SEC lawsuit was only the latest regulatory action by the U.S. government against crytpo this week. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice charged four market makers and more than a dozen individuals over market manipulation charges. Also Wednesday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler was very dismissive about the idea that bitcoin or crypto might catch on in any sort of significant way as a means of payment. He called out the crypto industry for being filled with ""fraudsters,"" and asserted that the ""leading lights"" of the sector were either in jail or soon to be on their way behind bars.  ""There's going to be a lot of noise between now and [the U.S.] election [in November] and it's likely bitcoin is just range bound until then,"" Lekker's Thompson added.

According to their recent analysis, token holders are bearish the most on Chainlink–a middleware solution that powers DeFi and NFTs, Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin. Out of their assessment, it is interesting to note that these coins on focus are those in the top 10, except for Chainlink that is still perched outside the top 20. While Chainlink tops the list, others, mainly Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin, are in the top 5. Chainlink Struggling Despite CCIP Success, Ethereum Disappoints Although Santiment didn’t provide a reason to explain why the community is bearish on these tokens, there are fundamental factors that prop up this outlook. Despite being a leader in DeFi through their Oracle solution and Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP), Chainlink still struggles for momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Market Shift: Are We Near A Major Sell-Off? LINK, the native token, rose to as high as $22, which is below the 2021 highs and is currently down 53% from the 2024 highs. Considering its role in DeFi and NFTs, holders expected the token to float higher, outperforming the market. This was especially so after the launch of the CCIP solution, which has found adoption among some of the top DeFi and TradFi platforms. Pessimism about Ethereum’s outlook could also stem from disappointment following the approval of the first batch of spot Ethereum ETFs. Unlike Bitcoin, whose prices ripped higher, breaking above $70,000 to as high as $74,000, spot Ethereum ETFs have not been as successful. As of October 10, Soso Value shows that all issuers in the United States managed just over $6.6 billion. Even so, there are massive outflows from Grayscale’s ETHE, heaping massive pressure on ETH prices. The second most valuable coin is still trading below $2,800 and is moving sideways in a possible distribution. Solana Suffers As Meme Coin Momentum Fades, Impact Of FTX Asset Distribution Solana, on the other hand, is also under pressure. The success of Pump.fun, which saw hundreds of thousands of meme coins deployed, supported prices. However, as Tron gains market share, the momentum is fading, negatively impacting prices.

Only U.S. equities fared better, with 55% of participants planning to invest.  Among millennial ETF investors, though, crypto was the leading asset class, with 62% saying they plan to allocate to that sector versus only 48% for U.S. stocks, 47% for bonds and 46% for real assets such as commodities.

34542005,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647282,1728583255,Solana Bullish Pattern Signals Massive Gains Ahead – 2021 Rally Could Repeat,"Solana (SOL) is currently trading at the lower end of a monthly range that began in March, positioning the asset at a pivotal level that will dictate its price action in the coming months. As the broader crypto market faces uncertainty, analysts and investors closely monitor whether this range represents an accumulation phase that could precede a significant rally. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details Top analyst and investor Mister Crypto recently shared a technical analysis comparing Solana’s current price structure to its 2021 performance, highlighting similarities that suggest a potential bullish breakout. His analysis reflects optimism amid market anxiety, with many believing Solana may be on the verge of another strong upward movement. While caution remains, investors await confirmation that Solana’s recent range-bound trading is laying the foundation for a sustained rally. The outcome in the next few weeks could significantly impact Solana’s trajectory for the rest of the year. Solana Price Action: Accumulation Or Bull Trap? Solana (SOL) has been trading within a range of $210 to $110 since mid-March, and while some investors are starting to believe this could be a bull trap rather than accumulation, others remain cautiously optimistic. A growing sentiment suggests that Solana’s prolonged sideways movement may not lead to the much-anticipated breakout but could lead to further declines. Despite these concerns, prominent analyst Mister Crypto provides a more bullish perspective. In his latest analysis, Mister Crypto compares the current market sentiment around Solana to that of 2021, just before the asset soared to new all-time highs. He highlights the similarities in market fear and uncertainty that preceded Solana’s previous explosive rally. According to him, such fear-driven consolidation is often a signal of bullish patterns taking shape, with the potential for substantial gains once the market recovers. Mister Crypto refrains from setting a specific price target but suggests that Solana’s next major move could surpass its all-time high of $260. While the current mood remains cautious, his analysis provides hope that Solana may be preparing for another significant upward move, as historical patterns have shown similar price behavior before major surges. Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation The coming weeks will likely be decisive for Solana as traders and investors wait to see if it will break out of its range or continue to face downside pressure. SOL Key Levels To Watch Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $138, following a 9% retrace from its daily 200 moving average (MA) at $152. This drop marks a significant loss of momentum, as the price also fell below the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $140—a crucial support level. Losing the 200 EMA raises concerns for further downside potential in the coming weeks. For bulls to regain control, the price must reclaim the 200 MA and EMA, and push above the critical resistance level at $160. A surge above this threshold would indicate renewed bullish momentum and the potential for Solana to rally higher. However, if SOL fails to recover these key indicators, it could signal a deeper correction. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential If the price continues to decline, traders may see SOL head toward lower demand zones around $110, a level that has acted as strong support in previous months. Investors and analysts are watching closely to see if Solana can hold its current levels or face more downside pressure in the near future. The next few days will be pivotal for SOL’s price action and overall market direction.

This is achieved through Kamino’s tokenized concentrated liquidity market maker (CLMM) positions, known as kTokens, which are fungible and easily tradable. Users can borrow against these positions or employ them in other strategies to maximise returns. The platform’s emphasis on automation and transparency provides users with detailed analytics and performance insights, empowering them to manage their liquidity positions more effectively. Kamino’s borrowing mechanism is powered by its K-Lend system, a novel peer-to-pool infrastructure that integrates lending, liquidity, and leverage into a unified market. K-Lend introduces features such as “Elevation Mode” (eMode), which enhances capital efficiency by allowing users to borrow highly correlated assets with higher leverage. This system is further supported by a poly-linear interest rate curve, allowing for more gradual interest rate changes and reducing the risk of sharp liquidity shocks. Overall, Kamino Finance represents a significant leap in DeFi automation and accessibility, offering users a seamless way to manage and optimise their on-chain liquidity strategies. Its unified approach, coupled with advanced risk management tools like auto-deleveraging and dynamic liquidation penalties, positions Kamino as a key player in the evolving landscape of decentralised finance. Get started What is the KMNO Token The KMNO token is the native utility and governance token for the Kamino Finance ecosystem. It plays a crucial role in powering the platform’s Decentralised Finance (DeFi) services, which include lending, liquidity provision, and leveraging strategies. KMNO is used to incentivize participation in the Kamino protocol, rewarding users who contribute liquidity, stake their assets, or participate in the governance of the platform. Holders of KMNO can stake their tokens to earn rewards, participate in governance proposals, and influence the future direction of the protocol. This allows the community to have a say in key decisions such as the introduction of new features, adjustments to fee structures, and other protocol upgrades. Additionally, the token may be used to boost liquidity rewards or access special features and benefits within the Kamino ecosystem. As Kamino Finance expands its suite of DeFi products, the KMNO token will continue to play an essential role in ensuring the platform’s growth and sustainability.

The SEC alleged that Cumberland used its research reports and update emails to promote investments in different cryptocurrencies, naming Polygon's {{POL}} (formerly MATIC), Solana's {{SOL}}, Cosmos' {{ATOM}}, Algorand's {{ALGO}} and Filecoin's {{FIL}} as ""a non-exhaustive list"" of cryptos that were sold as securities.  ""Public statements by the issuers and promoters of the Cumberland-Traded Assets – including statements retransmitted by Cumberland and by the third-party crypto asset trading platforms that Cumberland uses – would have led objective investors to reasonably view the offer to purchase or sell of each of the Cumberland-Traded Assets as offers to purchase and sell investment contracts, which are securities pursuant to the federal securities laws,"" the SEC's complaint said.  These investors expected to profit, the SEC alleged.  However, Cumberland did not register as a securities dealer.  The SEC, as it has in a few previous suits, went through the five example cryptocurrencies and laid out its arguments for how these assets look like securities, pointing to public statements from the projects' founders and white papers and Cumberland's own statements about the different assets.  As one example, the SEC alleged, Cumberland promoted ATOM through, ""An email sent to counterparties on February 20, 2023 stated: 'At the moment, one of the smaller gainers in the sector, outside of ETH and EOS, has been ATOM. ATOM is up ‘only’ 53% YTD, despite strong fundamentals and a healthy developer community; it’s a name where we expect to see a catchup rally if crypto remain buoyant.'""  The SEC is seeking a permanent injunction and disgorgement of proceeds, the suit said.  However, Cumberland pushed back against the suit on a social media post on X. ""We are not making any changes to our business operations or the assets in which we provide liquidity as a result of this action by the SEC.""  ""We are confident in our strong compliance framework and disciplined adherence to all known rules and regulations - even as they have been a moving target (it wasn't long ago ETH was claimed to be a security),"" the post said.",NEGATIVE,ATOM,ATOM | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/10/sec-sues-crypto-market-maker-cumberland-drw,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8d083bbb9f71e6a1c6fd413c4fd9f2bf3ce75e9d-6000x3376.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34540167,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647277,1728579619,Bitcoin Investors Accumulate Almost $1 Billion In BTC As Exchange Reserves Falls Towards New Lows,"Although the Bitcoin price faces challenges in breaking out significantly from its support level of $60,000, recent on-chain data reveals a fascinating shift in sentiment among Bitcoin enthusiasts. Despite the ongoing price corrections, it appears that long-term holders remain undeterred. In fact, about 15,917 BTC, valued at approximately $987 million, has been withdrawn from various cryptocurrency exchanges over the past week. Bitcoin Exits Crypto Exchanges In Droves According to a previous report by NewsBTC, Bitcoin’s recent dip to $60,000 can largely be attributed to the actions of short-term holders. On-chain data reveals that this particular group of traders decided to exit their positions after Bitcoin’s performance failed to meet expectations in early October, further intensifying the selling pressure. However, long-term holders have taken full advantage of this increased selling pressure. Rather than follow the short-term market sentiment, many long-term investors seized the opportunity to add more Bitcoin to their portfolios. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 8,400% Rise For XRP Price To $44, Calls It ‘Conservative’ As data would have it, long-term holders seem to have capitalized on the selling pressure, with many of them taking the opportunity to add to their holdings. According to on-chain data highlighted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the Bitcoin reserves on cryptocurrency exchanges have been in a steady decline since October 3. On that day, the total Bitcoin balance across exchanges stood at 2.5825 million BTC. What’s notable is that this figure was a result of several consecutive days of BTC inflows to exchanges, beginning on September 28 and continuing until October 3. During this time, the price of Bitcoin fell from $66,230 to $60,047, marking a decrease of about 9.3% as many traders sold on exchanges. However, in an interesting turn of events, long-term holders have seen this influx of BTC into exchanges as an opportunity to acquire more tokens. As a result, there has been a consistent decline in the total Bitcoin balance on exchanges since October 3. Numbers show that 15,917 BTC were withdrawn from exchanges between October 3 and the time of writing, bringing the total Bitcoin exchange reserve to about 2.5667 million BTC. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin? The outflow of BTC from exchanges is generally seen as positive for the cryptocurrency’s price moving forward, as it reduces the amount of BTC available for sale. During this outflow period, Bitcoin retested the $64,000 price level on October 7. However, it has since reversed and is approaching the $60,000 price floor again. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens As of the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $60,912, marking a 2.1% decline over the past 24 hours. This dip shows the importance of long-term holders and bullish investors continuing to accumulate BTC from exchanges. The onus now is on long-term holders to keep accumulating Bitcoin from exchanges in order to help prevent further price declines.

42407400,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH46q,1728578857,"Gary Gensler, We’re Gonna Miss You (Not)","SEC Chair Gary Gensler took to a stage at NYU School of Law in Manhattan on Wednesday and his comments had the air of someone who’s finally ready to say what he thinks. (My colleague Cheyenne Ligon had the report.)  His comments on crypto were expansive, sometimes quite wrong, and thoroughly damning to the industry’s prospects.  Gensler, like Alan Greenspan at the Fed back in the day, isn’t usually given to free-ranging answers. He’s a cautious technocrat. Wednesday was different.  He said cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, are unlikely to be used for payments.  “I did teach this stuff up at MIT and so forth, so I'm just going say this – these debates literally go back to Plato and Aristotle,"" he said. ""This is 3,000 years of history. Hundreds of great nations, thousands of nation-states – we tend to have one currency per geographic economic state. We tend even not to have bimetallism.""  In other words, Gensler believes that nation-states control money and that economies do better when there’s only one nation-issued currency. While this might be true, it’s quite a statement from an SEC chair. He’s showing that he’s not guided by what might be possible, or even better in the future; he’s guided by the past, including ancient history, at a time when we didn’t have electricity, let alone the internet.  Gensler said the crypto industry has produced ""a lot of fraudsters, a lot of grifters, a lot of scams,"" which is self-evidently true. But then he followed up with the statement: ""With all respect, the leading lights of this field in [2024] are either in jail or awaiting extradition right now."" That’s not true at all. We can disagree about how to define “leading lights” but even after all the enforcement actions from the SEC, most industry leaders are free and building like crazy. CZ is out. Vitalik Buterin is incubating his World Computer. Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong just got married.  Of course, SBF and several other 2022-era fraudsters are behind bars. But few people in crypto look to SBF as a leading light these days.  On the most important questions of all – Are tokens securities? and do token issuances represent investment contracts? – Gensler offered no hope that regulators might interpret laws to meet new technological and market conditions, or push for new ones. He said the Howey Test, enshrined by the Supreme Court in 1940, still sufficed.  ""If anybody is wondering whether [they] might meet this time-tested test of what is an investment contract … think about it this way, who is signing the engagement letter with your law firm? There's a central enterprise, somebody is signing that engagement letter. Who is tapping on the door of the broker-dealer saying, 'Can you make a market in my particular asset?' It belies logic that there's no common enterprise at most,"" Gensler said.  Gensler managed to achieve something hard yesterday: he was relatively expansive in his thinking on crypto but offered no clarity for anyone trying to build crypto in the United States, other than to say “look at laws made 80 years ago.”  As SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda told Fox this morning, Gensler’s tenure has been ""a disaster for the whole [crypto] industry.""  People in crypto disagree about many things but Gensler is the rare exception. With any luck, Gensler has started to be more expansive because he knows his time in office is coming to an end.

34538280,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647297,1728576011,Explosive Growth: NEAR Protocol Caters To 3 Million Daily Users,"As of Q3 2024, CryptoRank stated that 3 million addresses were active every day on NEAR Protocol, making it a major player in the blockchain world. This huge number is higher than both Tron (2 million daily active addresses) and Solana (2.4 million daily active addresses) during the same time period. Related Reading: $6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy The growth of NEAR is in line with a larger trend in the AI cryptocurrency market. This shows that blockchain and AI are becoming more and more intertwined. This point of contact is driving more and more technological progress and user engagement across these channels. Surge In The AI-Cryptocurrency Sector One of the most important factors influencing user engagement on NEAR is the rapid growth in AI-related decentralized applications or dApps. As DappRadar reported, AI dApps increased by 70% compared with the previous quarter in Q3. The survey indicated that AI dApps garnered 4.3 million daily unique active wallets, illustrating the growing interest in this sector of the cryptocurrency industry. NEAR Protocol has swiftly leveraged this trend by establishing collaborations with major corporations such as Nvidia and Alibaba to augment its AI capabilities. With this further integration with AI, in addition to NEAR’s strong growing ecosystem, the network finds itself at the helm of innovation in this emerging blockchain landscape. Although the ecosystem is still experiencing positive growth, market sentiment remains cautious as the price of the protocol decreased by 2.36% to $4.87, along with a more than 30% decrease in trading volume. NEAR Protocol: Price Fluctuations Amid Market Ambiguity The current price difficulties of NEAR can be ascribed to overarching market conditions rather than the protocol’s intrinsic value. Despite the optimistic outlook suggested by daily active addresses and collaborations, recent data indicates a 0.4% reduction in NEAR’s circulating supply, now totaling 1.11 billion tokens. The protocol’s market capitalization now stands at $5.42 billion, ranking it 23rd overall in the market. Related Reading: Could XRP Finally Hit $1? Key Factors To Consider, According To Analysts Price Forecast Indicates Rebound Potential The medium-term prognosis for NEAR is predominantly favorable. Technical analysis forecasts an upward trend in the forthcoming seven days, with the token presently trading 220% beneath its projected value for the subsequent month. During a three-month interval, the price is anticipated to rise by 240%, indicative of favorable market sentiment and heightened adoption. Prolonged projections are similarly positive, with a six-month growth anticipated at 178% and a one-year projection indicating a 165% increase. Although short-term price fluctuations may indicate general market instability, the long-term prospects for NEAR are clear. Investors must keep tabs of forthcoming ecosystem advancements and AI trends to assess the protocol’s price trajectory.

42407406,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH4DS,1728575591,Ripple Plans 'Cross-Appeal' in SEC Case,"Ripple Labs will file a cross-appeal in its ongoing case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company announced Thursday, as part of an effort to maintain its legal defenses as the SEC's own appeal in the case winds its way through an appeals court.  The SEC filed a notice of appeal earlier this month in its long-running case against Ripple, which the regulator first sued in December 2020. Ripple's cross-appeal is intended to ensure that the company preserves its points and arguments in the case, Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty told CoinDesk, though he did not go into detail on what the company may argue in its motion.  ""We're really doing that to make sure that we leave nothing on the table, including the argument that there cannot be an investment contract without there being the essential rights and obligations found in a contract,"" he said.  District Judge Analisa Torres ruled in July 2023 that Ripple's programmatic sales of XRP to exchanges, which in turn sold the token to retail customers, did not violate federal securities laws. Under her ruling, XRP is not deemed to be a security.  Like the SEC's filing last week, Ripple's initial filing is just a notice that it will submit a more comprehensive argument in the future. Alderoty said the two parties would have to fill out a form in the coming weeks laying out ""a fairly high level description"" of their arguments, but neither the regulator nor the company would get into the specifics until their opening briefs are filed.  The SEC's brief may come near the end of January, while Ripple's opening brief – which would be combined with its opposition to the SEC's brief – would come sometime after that, he said.  ""I don't think that folks who are paying attention should be much distracted by these efforts to create confusion, because I think the judge got it right, and I think they should welcome the opportunity for the court of appeals to roll on this issue and finally, bring the clarity that we need,"" Alderoty said about the appeals court taking up the case – though, he added, the U.S. ""really needs a policy solution"" from legislators rather than court rulings.  ""Short of that, and while we don't have one, it's going to be up to the courts, and we're willing to continue to fight that fight and collect victories and bring clarity to the industry through the litigation process,"" he said.",NEUTRAL,XRP,EXCHANGE | REGULATION | XRP,Nikhilesh De,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/10/ripple-plans-cross-appeal-in-sec-case,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e59d2b74ad700dedf69d95499e3d2d3d51e9f8cb-3200x1800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The exchange is particularly targeting institutional investors who are new to crypto.  DUBAI — Crypto exchange OKX has gone live in the UAE offering a dirham (AED)-denominated order book and integration with a local bank as it looks to attract retail clients and entice institutions that may have been reluctant to participate in the crypto market.  The opening, nine months after OKX Middle East Fintech FZE was granted full regulatory approval by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), will allow one of the four biggest cryptocurrency exchanges by volume to offer local residents access to a market without involving a broker who buys liquidity from outside the UAE, usually at a higher price, adding time and friction, said Rifad Mahasneh, the exchange's general manager for the Middle East.  ""We have two targets – to be the retail app of choice and market and to start converting institutions in the UAE to enter the space,"" Mahasneh said in an interview. ""The return on investment is going to come from our ability to convert traditional institutions.""  The combination of giving access to a regulated derivatives product, local-currency product and local banking channel could give entities representing global institutions, which have so far been sitting on the sidelines, comfort to trade, Mahasneh said. The company's banking partner is Zand Bank, which calls itself the UAE's first fully licensed, all-digital bank.  OKX is the first major exchange to go live with the combination of ""an AED banking integration and an AED order book,"" retail and institutional availability, and the first to offer regulated derivatives in the market, Mahasneh said. It will offer 280 tokens and 400 trading pairs in the region.  Binance and Crypto.com are the other major international exchanges with full licenses from VARA. After announcing a partnership with Standard Chartered in August, Crypto.com's retail app is now available in the UAE, the company told CoinDesk in an email. Binance did not respond to a CoinDesk request for comment about whether it had gone live in the UAE.  VARA's public register shows OKX's license was issued Sept. 17.  ""While that's VARA reflecting it's confident of you as a firm to operate in this space, the license comes with certain conditions that you need to complete before you go live,"" Mahasneh said.

42407411,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH4Tz,1728572883,"Heather 'Razzlekhan' Morgan Should Spend 18 Months in Prison, Prosecutors Tell Court","Prosecutors have requested that Heather Morgan – better known by her rap moniker “Razzlekhan” – be sentenced to just 18 months behind bars for her role in laundering 120,000 bitcoins stolen from Bitfinex in a 2016 hack.  In August 2023, Morgan pleaded guilty to one count of money laundering conspiracy and one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, each of which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.  Though Morgan and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein were first believed to only have laundered the proceeds of the hack (worth approximately $7.5 billion at today’s value), Lichtenstein later admitted to being the original hacker and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.  According to court documents, Lichtenstein carried out the hack alone in 2016, and did not tell his wife or enlist her help with laundering the money until four years later, in 2020, making her only an accessory to the crime after it had already occurred.  “She was in some ways thrust into the middle of a serious criminal scheme without her initial consent, and undoubtedly felt compelled to support it out of a sense of loyalty to her husband and desire to preserve their life together,” prosecutors wrote in the memo. “That does negate the seriousness of her conduct, as she did ultimately join her husband’s conspiracy and use her own skillset to aid and enhance his criminal endeavors.”  Prosecutors have suggested a lenient sentence for Morgan in light of her early acceptance of responsibility and apparently “substantial assistance to law enforcement,” as well as the fact that she herself spent very little of the criminal proceeds.  However, they also urged the judge to take into account that, at several points during the investigation, Morgan attempted to obstruct justice by destroying evidence – throwing a computer down a garbage chute, deleting data from devices, and, during law enforcement’s execution of a search warrant at her and Lichtenstein’s Manhattan apartment, pretended to be grabbing her cat from under the bed while secretly shutting off her phone.  In addition to requesting jail time for Morgan, prosecutors have asked the court to order her to “return the cryptocurrencies seized by the government directly from the Bitfinex Hack Wallet – including approximately 94,643.29837084 BTC, 117,376.52651940 Bitcoin Cash (BCH), 117,376.58178024 Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV), and 118,102.03258447 in Bitcoin Gold (BTG) valued at more than $6 billion at current prices – as in-kind restitution to Bitfinex.”  Morgan is set to be sentenced on Nov. 15 at 2:00 PM in Washington, D.C., one day after Lichtenstein is sentenced.",NEGATIVE,BCH | BSV | BTG,BCH | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | BSV | BTG,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2024/10/10/heather-razzlekhan-morgan-should-spend-18-months-in-prison-prosecutors-tell-court,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/63a9e8a68431edafab74ccb37a4147b940453a8e-1365x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34536384,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647280,1728572412,"XRP Could Surge To $60 Overnight Using SWIFT Model, Expert Says","Levi Rietveld, a popular crypto analyst with 122,000 followers on X, has released a new video detailing how XRP could potentially surge to $60 overnight by capturing a fraction of SWIFT’s transaction volume. “XRP will hit $60 overnight with this SWIFT news! Here’s the math!!” he teased via X. How XRP Could Skyrocket To $60 Overnight In his analysis, Rietveld delves into the mechanics of SWIFT, the global financial messaging network that processes a significant portion of international payments. He highlights that SWIFT handles approximately $7 trillion per day, amounting to about $1.5 quadrillion annually. “If XRP was to eat into just 5% of SWIFT’s business, it would allow an increase of 1,252 times in volume for XRP compared to what we are seeing right now,” Rietveld explains. “This could translate into an over 9,000% increase for XRP, potentially pushing its price to around $50 per coin.” Related Reading: XRP Price Set To Soar Past $5.85, Predicts Crypto Analyst Rietveld further extrapolates that if the cryptocurrency were to capture 10% or 20% of SWIFT’s volume, the cryptocurrency’s price could soar to $100 or even exceed $200 per coin, respectively. “The amount of price impact that we are able to see for XRP if we eat into just a very small portion of SWIFT’s overall volume is insane,” he emphasizes. He argues that the crypto asset offers significant advantages over traditional SWIFT transactions, including faster settlement times, lower fees, and the elimination of the need for banks to hold large reserves in multiple currencies. “It’s cheaper, it’s faster, it’s more reliable, and it costs businesses a lot less money to use overall because they don’t need to hold these massive reserves of every single currency that exists—they just hold XRP,” Rietveld notes. Related Reading: XRP Will Jump 75% If It Holds Current Demand Level – Details Rietveld also discusses the potential for a supply shock if institutions begin accumulating the crypto asset. He points out that a substantial portion of the token is locked in escrow, and institutional demand could exceed the available public supply. “That’s not enough, frankly speaking. That’s not enough XRP for all these institutions, so they’re going to have to buy from the public supply—the XRP that me and you are buying,” he says. “With how limited the XRP supply is already, it’s going to allow us to see XRP’s price just catapult to levels never seen before.” Looking ahead, Rietveld is optimistic about long-term prospects. “I could literally see this thing going to $200 per coin very easily, and I think this is something that we could actually see happen within the next 10 years—not in the next five, but in the next 10 years,” he predicts. “This next year, though, I do think that XRP is going to be going above $10—not a doubt in my mind.” $XRP WILL HIT $60 OVERNIGHT WITH THIS SWIFT NEWS!

Eric Tomaszewski from Verde Capital Management provides considerations when looking at this model in Ask an Expert.  - Sarah Morton  You’re reading Crypto for Advisors, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday.  What Can Bitcoin Do for the American Dream?  Homeownership has been central to the American dream for decades, but the risks for both borrowers and lenders remain consistent across market cycles. Borrowers face property market volatility, negative equity, illiquidity and the ongoing burden of taxes, insurance and maintenance. Lenders, meanwhile, are exposed to borrower defaults, interest rate risk, prepayment and economic downturns.  While innovative credit managers have begun integrating bitcoin into commercial debt structures, the question arises: can this approach be adapted to mortgages to reduce risk for both borrowers and lenders while capitalizing on bitcoin's growth potential?  Your home: A highly concentrated risk  For most Americans, homeownership represents a concentrated financial risk, with the majority of their wealth tied up in a single asset. Property values fluctuate based on market conditions, inflation and local factors. Homeowners also bear ongoing costs such as taxes, insurance and maintenance, making it difficult to quickly generate liquidity in an emergency.  Bitcoin: A liquid, appreciating asset  Bitcoin’s fixed supply and growing adoption make it a compelling asset to include in a mortgage collateral package. Unlike real estate, bitcoin is highly liquid and easily convertible to cash, allowing homeowners quicker access to funds when needed. Its value is driven by scarcity, decentralized nature and historically strong long-term appreciation, providing potential benefits to both borrowers and lenders.  Bitcoin in the mortgage collateral package  Integrating bitcoin into a mortgage requires a shared, long-term view between the borrower and the lender. While bitcoin’s short-term volatility is well-known, its long-term appreciation presents a significant opportunity for value growth. Borrowers and lenders can benefit from this growth while sharing the associated risks.  In this model, the mortgage covers both the cost of the home and an allocation for purchasing Bitcoin. The lender manages the Bitcoin portion, and as its value appreciates, profits are shared between both parties. The borrower’s stake in the bitcoin increases over time, incentivizing long-term homeownership and reducing the likelihood of early repayment.  Benefits for lenders and borrowers  This hybrid collateral structure provides notable advantages:  Reduced risk and diversified collateral for lenders: Bitcoin’s inclusion diversifies collateral portfolios, reducing lenders' exposure to real estate market downturns. Its non-correlation with real estate provides a hedge, improving loan stability.  Lower interest rates and favorable terms: Bitcoin’s growth potential offsets lender risk, allowing for more favorable loan terms, including lower interest rates or shorter loan durations.  Shared growth potential: Both parties benefit from bitcoin’s appreciation. Lenders can enhance their portfolios, while borrowers gain access to growing bitcoin equity, which can be used for liquidity needs or home repairs. This alignment fosters a long-term financial partnership.  Enhancing homeownership sustainability with appreciating assets: Traditionally, homes require significant financial outlays for taxes, insurance and maintenance. By integrating bitcoin, homeowners can leverage Bitcoin’s growth to offset these ongoing costs, turning what is often a financial burden into a more sustainable model.  A new future for homeownership  By incorporating bitcoin as collateral, homeowners gain access to an appreciating asset that can help cover ongoing expenses like repairs and renovations, without dipping into personal savings or taking on additional debt. This added flexibility makes homeownership more financially sustainable, with bitcoin serving as a reserve for inevitable costs.  At a community level, the positive effects could be profound. Homeowners benefiting from bitcoin’s growth would have more resources to invest in maintaining their properties, improving the overall health and resilience of neighborhoods. This could lead to healthier, more attractive communities and new possibilities for sustainable homeownership.  Incorporating bitcoin into mortgage structures provides a more flexible, growth-oriented relationship for both lenders and borrowers. As bitcoin continues to gain traction as a financial asset, its role in reshaping traditional mortgages could mark a significant advancement for homeownership and the American dream.  - Meredith Yarbrough, managing partner and co-founder, La Hoja Capital Partners  Ask an Expert  Q. What are the similarities amongst Bitcoin and the American Dream?  At its core, the American dream represents the idea that anything is possible through hard work and a will to succeed. Bitcoin represents individuals taking control of their financial future without the reliance on centralized institutions. It's very much about promoting self sovereignty and freedoms.  Central to the American dream is the idea that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed. With bitcoin, anyone with an Internet connection has the ability to participate and get access.  America has innovated and progressed because of a fire of entrepreneurial spirit. Bitcoin embodies a technology that progresses us towards the next iteration of humanity.  Q. How can I utilize BTC to get a mortgage in the US market?  I would suggest taking a step back. Everything starts with assessing goals and priorities. It's about building a thoughtful plan without concentration in any specific investments. I am of the mindset that too much of anything is a bad thing which is why balancing a plan with digital assets and traditional assets can actually be really strategic and fruitful if done correctly.  If someone is over-concentrated within BTC, it could be a conversation about de-risking their digital asset portfolio or setting realistic expectations with timelines associated with the goal of buying a home. Everything comes back to being mindful about planning so the assets or investments are utilized effectively. It’s also important to remind yourself that rent in many instances can actually be a better financial decision for a client's needs and the overall plan.  - Eric Tomaszewski, financial advisor, Verde Capital Management  Keep Reading  According to the ETF Institute, out of 525 funds launched in 2024, 13 out of the top 24 best-performing ETFs are related to bitcoin and ether.

The protocol's so-called Reserve Fund will allocate roughly $18 million in BUIDL, $13 million in USDS, $8 million in USDM and $7 million in USTB, according to a governance forum post.  USDe generates yield by holding spot bitcoin {{BTC}} and ether {{ETH}} while shorting, or selling, equal amounts of BTC and ETH derivatives, harvesting the difference in funding rates. The allocation will allow Ethena to earn a yield on the surplus funds accrued from protocol revenues that serve as an insurance for periods when funding rates turn negative.  Ethena's move fits into a growing trend of DeFi platforms and protocol foundations moving part of their treasury assets to tokens backed by real-world assets (RWA) such as U.S. short-term government bonds to earn a yield that's independent from crypto markets without leaving blockchain rails.

42407399,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZH43X,1728569344,The U.S. Fell Behind in Crypto. It Cannot Afford to Fall Behind in AI,"From the Industrial Revolution to the Digital Age, the United States has been defined by its spirit for entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity. American entrepreneurship has been a talent magnet and attracted global minds to build and innovate in the U.S., myself included. Immigrants have founded or co-founded 65% of the top AI companies in the United States.  The technological advancements that have come from the United States have been a key driver for global innovation and leadership for decades, with the rest of the world adopting these groundbreaking technologies. But it now faces a potential threat to its reign – as a once undisputed leader in technological innovation, the U.S.’s reputation and standing is now being challenged.  While the U.S. for now remains a leader in venture capital funding for AI, in May 2024, PitchBook released a report showing that pre-seed and seed funding in U.S.-based generative AI companies saw a sharp decline, but companies in Asia and Europe are seeing a steady increase. But, we’ve seen this before. In crypto.  Crypto was once the technology being championed to push us into the generation of Web3, seeing great promise only to falter in the U.S. because of its hostile regulatory policies. The country's actions – or inactions, rather – force the question: How can it stay a global tech leader if it continues to miss the mark when it comes to new tech innovation booms? For the sake of AI innovation, we simply cannot let the U.S. fall behind like it has with crypto.  The U.S.’s crypto downfall  The U.S.’s rise and fall with crypto is a cautionary tale that sets the scene for what could be to come in AI. In early crypto days, the U.S. was the promise land with a plethora of startups and investment funding flowing into the space creating room for innovation, growth and mass adoption. In recent years, this has slowed down due to a lack of regulation and policy. The SEC started bringing in lawsuits and regulatory policies based on pre-crypto laws – essentially trying to fit a round peg into a square hole. They went after Consensys, Coinbase, Ripple and other companies that have a reputable standing in Web3, just to make… what point? The lack of clear policies and regulation hinders progress, forcing these companies to spend resources on legal battles, while pushing companies and talent elsewhere to continue building the decentralized dream.  Not long ago, OpenSea received a Wells Notice from the SEC, where the regulator argued that NFTs are a security. While we have to watch this and many others unfold to determine what regulations the SEC is going to deem across these companies, it’s a sad, yet perfect example of how the U.S. has stifled the growth and innovation of crypto through its policies. Meanwhile, governments in jurisdictions like Switzerland, Singapore, and Hong Kong have embraced crypto and used their forward-looking crypto policies to vie for coveted seats on the global tech leaderboard.  So let’s examine the contrast. Singapore has already established a robust regulatory framework that benefits both local and international players to settle down in the country. Singapore acted quickly, in January 2024, they implemented the Singapore Payment Services Act which provided the industry with clarity and legitimized crypto on a country-wide scale. Singapore stands today as a global crypto leader, seeing the second most crypto deals for companies headquartered there in Q1 2024, just behind the U.S., and a projected revenue in the crypto market was estimated to reach $238.5M in 2024.  Other leaders in crypto have shown similar policy implementations. Switzerland regulates crypto through the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, introduced the “Blockchain Act” and in turn attracted over 1,000 new companies to the country. Meanwhile, Hong Kong serves as an interesting example as they have no official crypto laws, but do have crypto regulations and were, before the U.S., beginning to approve ETFs, opening up regulated access to capital for the crypto industry.  Where the U.S. stand on AI policy  So, where United States stands on crypto regulations is ever-evolving but over the last year specifically, artificial intelligence has taken center stage in tech. Let’s dive into where the United States stands in AI regulations to date.  AI policies seem to be following in the footsteps of crypto policies and similar challenges among the two industries are arising. As of now, the United States is still the home to a majority of major AI companies and research organizations. The risk sits in the likely possibility that U.S.’s current and proposed regulatory frameworks cap the growth of the AI industry.  Let’s look at Singapore as an example again. Singapore has been eyeing the leadership position for AI and its being noticed. Its recipe for success seems to be working again, as the country has created balanced strategies by creating guidelines for building responsible AI while pushing for continued innovation.  In contrast to other major tech trends, the speed of AI innovation is unparalleled. Builders are shipping new products, features, and applications everyday. We as builders don't even know where the ceiling of AI is, how would the government know the ceiling of AI? Setting limits for high-potential technologies is unwise and will drive talent out of the US (just like what regulations did to crypto).  In reality, Little AI is going to bear most of the burden of AI regulations. Unlike Big AI, which has lobbyists to work with regulators. Little AI simply are not equipped to bear the regulatory burden and endure the cost. The job of Little AI now is to build and to explore the frontier of AI innovation.  This point is particularly true for AI: unlike past tech trends, it requires fewer humans and less resources to build with AI now. Many solo developers are shipping cutting-edge AI products. Many open-source communities are exploring the frontier of AI. We are simply not equipped to deal with regulatory burden, especially as the future of AI is packed with unknowns.  Lessons from crypto  A deep dive into the regulatory frameworks to come out of Singapore in both crypto and AI offers guidance to the U.S., which is why the country has become a hub for both industries. Singapore does not stifle innovation through regulation, they are mutually beneficial. The United States must learn from other countries to stay ahead when it comes to AI. AI regulation needs to be flexible and fair and not be built to stifle innovation. Current and proposed regulatory frameworks in the U.S. focus on problems and solutions for Big AI – the OpenAI, Claude, Midjourneys – of the world. For example, the just passed California bill SB 1047 now awaiting Governor Newsom’s signature is now one of the most significant regulatory frameworks on AI safety, but the efforts feel hasty and not matching the unparalleled growth the industry will continue to see. These blanket regulations hurt smaller AI (or Little AI) companies, in turn creating a system that’s not fair to both institutions and consumers alike.  Moving forward, policy makers need to take AI generally into account, focusing on policies that can be flexible in order to not hinder innovation. Politicians should advocate for the growth and innovations of AI as the benefits far outweigh the negatives… if we do it right. As Dr. Li Fei-Fei points out, overly stringent regulations could harm the U.S. ecosystem. Instead, fostering an environment where innovation can flourish will help maintain the U.S.'s tech leadership.  Conclusion  Overall, AI is different: the speed of innovation is faster and we don't know what we don't know. AI requires fewer humans to be involved, which inspired a wave of solo developers and solo source communities worldwide. The U.S. has undeniable leadership when it comes to its influence in technology but if its recent track record continues, this could be the beginning of the dethroning. The lessons from the crypto boom need to serve as a warning: the only answer is to build policies responsibly, without hindering innovation or progress. I’m not saying it’s an easy feat, but it can’t be one that’s overlooked. The November elections are coming up and both AI and crypto platforms are under a microscope. AI will continue to evolve. So can the U.S. keep up?

Related Reading: $6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy According to Santiment, the development activity regarding Solana has increased by 10.7% just within the last week, and the signal is clear that developers and projects alike are interested in this space. 🧑‍💻 Looking at full crypto ecosystem development activity provides nice long-term roadmaps as to which are innovating and gaining on the ultra-competitive competition that this sector provides. As of the first week of October, Solana’s has continued to emerge with a +10.7% rise… pic.twitter.com/Y5hOxJpHJl — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 7, 2024 Meanwhile, based on the recent Solana price estimate by CoinCodex, the cryptocurrency might experience a potential increase of 14% by November 9, 2024, and hit the $159 level. Despite the fact that this is a bullish view, the technical numbers suggest that the market is now experiencing a negative vibe. Investors are experiencing a level of worry that is 39 on the Fear and Greed Index. Although both Arbitrum and Avalanche showcased some positive growth, as well—both 5.2% growth—Solana’s is more significant, which would easily place it ahead of its peers in terms of developers’ involvement and any further growth of the platform anytime soon. Solana’s growing network activity spells that this is now the preferred destination for new blockchain ideas and decentralized applications programs (dApps). Solana: Surge In Development Activity More developers are choosing to build dApps, test new features, and deploy the overall functionality of the blockchain on Solana. Now, that’s not only interest but investment in the long-term potential of the platform. Even without the introduction of new projects in this space, Solana’s ecosystem is already a stand-out through its scalability and speed. New projects on these lines could bring even more promising advancements. Whether it is transaction speeds or the development of DeFi tools, growth in activity usually presents large-scale improvements that are soon going to hit the blockchain platforms. Competition With Arbitrum And Avalanche Things are getting close to the knifing stage as Blockchain platforms continue to fight for dominance. Arbitrum and Avalanche also continued their steady growth rates but, of course, Solana outperforms in this last week and marks its potential as a leader in the near future. Related Reading: Could XRP Finally Hit $1? Key Factors To Consider, According To Analysts Regarding investments, things are rather more complicated. Recently, Solana’s price charts displayed a so-called “3 White Soldiers” pattern—a traditional signal of a bearish to a bullish trend reversal. Given macroeconomic elements like monetary policy and the influence of elections on the broader market, this could indicate an upward movement in the near future. But even when it reaches the level of the positive development and charts, technical indicators are still sounding a cautious note. The Fear & Greed Index, for example, is still at 39, which suggests that investors are still jittery about the market. Solana’s performance in the last month was rather mixed, with only 14 out of 30 days showing positive gains. Even though the CoinCodex prediction might turn north, the 5.62% volatility depicts that this market is really unpredictable and investors must consider these factors before a premature investment. So far, there’s great momentum for the development of Solana but what this could become in terms of sustained price increases is yet to be known.

42407425,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSDM,1728565200,"Uniswap Developer Unveils Own Layer-2 Network, Unichain, Built on Optimism Tech","Uniswap Labs, the developer behind top-ranked decentralized crypto exchange Uniswap, disclosed that it has built a new layer-2 network, which was set to launch on testnet Thursday.  The new project was built using Optimism's OP Stack, a blockchain blueprint that also has been used by the crypto exchange Coinbase and electronics giant Sony to spin up layer-2 networks.  The main developer behind Uniswap, the largest decentralized crypto exchange, plans to launch its own blockchain as a layer-2 network atop Ethereum – part of an effort to make transactions faster and cheaper while also improving liquidity.  Unichain, as the new network is known, was set to go live on a private test network Thursday, according to a press release.  The project's technical development is being led by Uniswap Labs, relying on technology borrowed from the Ethereum layer-2 team Optimism's OP Stack. As such, Unichain will become a part of the Superchain, a federation of Optimism-affiliated networks that includes the U.S. crypto exchange Coinbase's own layer-2 blockchain, Base.  ""People actually want things to feel instant,” said Hayden Adams, the inventor of Uniswap and CEO of Uniswap Labs, in an interview with CoinDesk, when asked about the motivation for the initiative.  The news is in line with the ongoing trend that's hit the Ethereum scaling world since the end of 2023: giant and familiar crypto exchanges launching their own layer-2 networks. Coinbase famously created the Basewith OP Stack, while OKX has X Layer, using technology from the team behind another layer-2 project, Polygon.  Another Layer-2 Arrives  Over the course of the past year, layer-2s have popped up everywhere, and some in the industry have argued there is a growing fatigue, as well as fragmentation, because of these networks. Some pundits have argued that there could be thousands of layer-2 networks within a matter of years, and teams are already building layer 3s to run atop the layer 2s.  Adams argues that the fatigue is due to the fact that “there's way more people focused on infrastructure than people focused on use cases for that infrastructure. And so it leads to where you have a million platforms seeking developers, and not that many developers seeking a platform.”  His argument for Unichain is that, just as Uniswap is a liquidity hub on the Ethereum network, Unichain could be a DeFi hub for many chains, as part of various chains that are plugged into Optimism’s Superchain ecosystem.  “We think that that can ultimately lead to products and user experiences that feel more like the real world, things that don't feel like you have to learn something entirely new to use them,” Adams told CoinDesk.  Technical details  As part of the unveiling, the Uniswap Labs team plans to bring unique technological features to the chain, built with Ethereum research and development team Flashbots, including a trusted execution environment (TEE) for block building and a secure computing area that ensures transactions and code are not tampered with, as well as a community validation network.  The TEE is supposed to bring transparency to transaction ordering, building blocks between 200-250 milliseconds, the team shared in a press release. That works out to between one-fifth and one-fourth of a second, versus 12 seconds now on the Ethereum mainnet and two seconds on most layer-2 networks.  ""Going from two seconds to 250 milliseconds for the experience that a user will have is actually extremely impactful,”Adams said.  Faster blocks also could reduce opportunities for maximal extractable value (MEV), which is where automated trading bots are able to frontrun transactions sitting in a blockchain's queue, before they can be processed.  The community validation network, coming in 2025, is supposed to help with decentralization “by allowing full nodes to help verify blocks by staking UNI,"" the Uniswap team wrote in the press release.  ""This approach reduces the risk of sequencers proposing conflicting or invalid blocks, which could delay transaction finality or expose users to financial risks from interacting with unfinalized blocks.”  Read more: Optimism Pushes for 'Interoperability' Between Affiliated Blockchains",POSITIVE,UNI,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | SPONSORED | UNI,Margaux Nijkerk,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2024/10/10/uniswap-developer-unveils-own-layer-2-network-unichain-built-on-optimism-tech,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4b80875ab5cb695812fd87656c2e6c9eb4a709e2-1950x1097.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
34532549,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647258,1728565200,Why Is Bitcoin Price Stagnating? Investment Firm CEO Answers,"The stagnation of the Bitcoin price despite the first rate cut by the US Federal Reserve since 2020 has perplexed many investors and traders within the market. In a new post on X, Andrew Kang, CEO of Mechanism Capital addressed the disproportionate emphasis that market participants have placed on Federal Reserve rate cuts and economic stimulus in China. Why Is Bitcoin Stagnating? Kang challenges the prevalent market belief that interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve will significantly boost Bitcoin and crypto prices. “Fed rates are only one of the factors that impact global liquidity, and global liquidity itself is only one of the factors that influence crypto prices,” he stated. Kang finds it “nonsensical to see BTC rally 4.5x during a period where rates were going to and at multi-decade highs—showing little correlation between rates and BTC—and then expect a strong inverse correlation to present itself as soon as rates start going down.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Going Through A ‘Generational’ Shift, CryptoQuant CEO He acknowledges that some argue future rate changes are already priced into the market but counters that this logic should apply equally to rate hikes and cuts. “This is not to say that rates are not important, but rather that they are well overweighted by most market participants,” Kang added. He notes that equities have a stronger tie to interest rates due to factors like discount rates used in valuing cash flows and mature corporate debt markets used to finance growth. Addressing China’s recent economic stimulus, Kang observes that its impact on Bitcoin and crypto is even less significant than many believe. “It’s not surprising to see that the people extrapolating China stimulus as being extremely bullish for crypto are primarily non-Chinese,” he commented. According to Kang, those within China have noted a shift from crypto investments to A-shares in the stock market. Supporting his claim with data, Kang pointed out, “Since Chinese stimulus was announced, USDT has traded to a discount to CNY. Still at 3% as of recent.” This suggests a decreased demand for the premier stablecoin Tether (USDT) in China, aligning with a move towards traditional equities. Despite his critiques, Kang clarifies that he is not bearish on Bitcoin. “I just think that some people have gotten over their skis a little,” he remarked. Kang anticipates Bitcoin trading within a range of $50,000 to $72,000 until a significant new catalyst emerges. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Options Set To Supercharge Price Volatility, Expert Warns However, he remains optimistic about opportunities within the market, stating, “The constant rotation of capital and new projects being developed means there will still be coins to buy to generate returns as a bull.” Nonetheless, Kang warns of potential volatility due to leveraged positions: “The market will still be prone to smaller corrections if leverage gets too high (decently high right now).” Engaging with the community, X user Jakubko (@erkousti) suggested that Bitcoin’s 2023 price increase is more connected to anticipation of an ETF launch than interest rates. Kang concurred, responding, “That’s exactly my point. Interest rates are only a small piece of the puzzle. Even though they were negative for BTC, other factors like the ETF were able to drive BTC price higher. Other factors could drive it higher or lower here. We are not guaranteed infinity prices just because of rate cuts.” Echoing this sentiment, crypto analyst Astronomer (@astronomer_zero) commented, “I believe interest rates (and yield inversion) only have a negligible impact on price. They are rather a holistic metric important for bond market players. But the zero-effect on stocks or crypto is proven already.” Another analyst, Res (@resdegen), highlighted the correlation between Bitcoin and monetary supply: “BTC is more correlated to the quantity of money than interest rates. It started to rise as the RRP decreased, which ended up in net positive liquidity, regardless of interest rates, which were indeed close to the top.” At press time, BTC traded at $60,903.

42407429,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSJy,1728564079,"U.S. September CPI Disappoints, Rising a Faster Than Expected 0.2%","The CPI rose 0.2% in September and the core CPI rose 0.3%, both numbers stronger than anticipated  The data reinforces the notion that not only will the Fed not cut rates 50 basis points in November, but might chose to not trim rates at all.  Already under pressure over the past 10 days, the price of bitcoin fell a bit more following the numbers.  Inflation came in stronger than expected in the U.S. in September, according to the government's Consumer Price Index report released Thursday morning.  The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in September versus economist forecasts for 0.1% and a 0.2% rise in August. On a year-over-year basis, the CPI was higher by 2.4% against expectations for 2.3% and 2.5% in August.  Core CPI – which excludes more volatile food and energy costs – rose 0.3% in September versus forecasts for 0.2% and 0.3% in August. Year-over-year core CPI was higher by 3.3% versus an expected 3.2% and 3.2% in August.  Under pressure for much of the past ten days, the price of bitcoin {{BTC}} fell further following the report, last trading at $60,800, down nearly 2% from 24 hours prior.  The U.S. Federal Reserve surprised many in September by beginning its rate-cutting cycle with a larger 50 basis point rate cut instead of the assumed 25 basis point move. The action sparked a sizable rally in crypto prices as investors factored in not just that rate cut but expectations of an equally large move at the Fed's next policy meeting in early November.  Thanks to hawkish comments from Fed Chair Jay Powell (and other central bank officials) and a far stronger than expected employment report last Friday, those expectations, however, have undergone a major reversal over the past ten days, perhaps contributing to the big pullback in crypto prices over that time frame. According to CME FedWatch – which does the service of converting pricing in short-term interest rate markets into odds on what the Fed will do at each of its policy meetings – the chances for a 50 basis point rate cut in November have gone to zero. In fact, rate markets prior to this morning's inflation data had priced in a 26% chance the Fed doesn't trim rates at all – up from 0% one week ago.  Today's inflation numbers are likely to reinforce the idea that the Fed may pause any rate cuts in November, but offsetting the disappointing CPI might be some weak employment data. Initial jobless claims – which had pretty much flatlined at very low levels for many weeks – shot higher to 258,000 last week from 225,000 previously and versus forecasts for 230,000. It's unclear, though, how much the aftermath of Hurricane Helene might have affected the data.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Stephen Alpher,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/10/us-september-cpi-disappoints-rising-a-faster-than-expected-02,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f8cfbb80502d312ba0e730a2e901161fad27c2e-5472x3648.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42407438,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHSh7,1728561660,First Mover Americas: Bitcoin Returns to $61K Ahead of September CPI Report,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter, putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  CoinDesk 20 Index: 1,887.55 -1.61%  Bitcoin (BTC): $61,068.94 -1.66%  Ether (ETH): $2,398.48 -1.49%  S&P 500: 5,792.04 +0.71%  Gold: $2,617.57 +0.35%  Nikkei 225: 39,380.89 +0.26%  Top Stories  Bitcoin nursed losses during the European morning, trading about 1.6% lower over 24 hours even after returning to $61,000 following a dip to as low as $60,300 late on Wednesday. The broader crypto market has fallen 2%, as measured by the CoinDesk 20 Index. Attention will turn to September's CPI report out of the U.S. later Thursday, which is expected to show increases of 0.1% month-on-month and 2.3% year-on-year. Hotter-than-expected prints could strengthen calls to stop interest-rate cuts, which would likely weigh on risk assets such as cryptocurrencies.  The minutes from the September Fed meeting, released Wednesday, showed policymakers were divided on how aggressive the central bank should be. ""A substantial majority of participants"" favored cutting the interest rate by half a percentage point, though some expressed misgivings about going that large, the minutes said. ""Crypto sentiment has moved back into the fear zone (39), reinforcing the contrast with 72 (greed) in equities,"" said Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior analyst at FxPro. ""This dynamic is easily explained by the appreciation of the dollar and the increased attractiveness of bonds, which reduces institutional traction in bitcoin."" The dollar index (DXY), rose to 102.97, the highest since Aug. 16, taking the cumulative gain since the Sept. 30 low of 100.18 to 2.7%, according to data source TradingView.  Ether ETFs in the U.S. registered zero flows in either direction on Wednesday, according to data compiled by SoSoValue. This is the second time this week the funds have seen no activity and the third time since they listed in July. That leaves net outflows since their debut at $562 million, in contrast to their bitcoin equivalents, which have drawn net inflows of nearly $19 billion since January. Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of over $30.5 million on Wednesday. It was a fairly muted day for them too, with nine of the 11 funds registering zero flows in either direction.  Chart of the Day  Bitcoin's seven-day options skew has slipped to -8.5%, the lowest in four weeks.  The negative print indicates a bias for protective put options, reflecting fears of downside price risks.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  SEC Chair Gary Gensler on Crypto: ‘It’s Unlikely This Stuff Is Gonna Be a Currency’  Prosecutors Charge Four Crypto ‘Market Makers,’ Employees With Market Manipulation, Fraud  For Millennials, Bitcoin Is the New Real Estate",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/10/first-mover-americas-bitcoin-returns-to-61k-ahead-of-september-cpi-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/acde8621a676255d43631eee0beff9f3c9ec4d93-1958x720.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34530681,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647202,1728561649,Analyst Warns Of Bitcoin Market Shift: Are We Near A Major Sell-Off?,"Bitcoin has recently seen quite an interesting trend in its key metrics suggesting a significant movement ahead, according to a post by CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha. The post, shared on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, highlights notable changes in both long-term and short-term holder behaviour of Bitcoin, as well as in realized profit and loss figures. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Non-Realized Profits Hit Negative Levels—What Does This Mean for Investors? Key Bitcoin Metrics Suggesting Market Shifts Taha begins by explaining the fundamental difference between short-term and long-term Bitcoin holders. Short-term holders (STH) are traders who engage in brief buying and selling activities, often employing strategies like day trading or swing trading to capitalize on Bitcoin’s price fluctuations. On the other hand, long-term holders (LTH) adopt a buy-and-hold strategy, aiming for long-term gains by holding onto their Bitcoin for extended periods. This distinction sets the stage for understanding the recent changes in market activity. In his analysis, Taha noted a sharp decline in the realized capitalization for long-term holders, which dropped from $19 billion to -$5 billion. This indicates that long-term holders have been taking profits or closing their positions, potentially signalling reduced confidence in further price gains. On the flip side, short-term holders have increased their buying activity, with their realized capitalization rising from -$17 billion to $11 billion. This suggests that short-term traders either take on more risk or bet on potential price increases, creating a more volatile market environment. Additionally, Taha touched on the Korea Premium Index, often called the “Kimchi Premium.” This index tracks the price difference between Bitcoin traded on South Korean and global exchanges. Currently, the index is near zero or negative, meaning Bitcoin is trading at a lower price in South Korea than the rest of the world. This implies reduced buying pressure from Korean traders, who have historically played a large role in increasing cryptocurrency prices due to the local trading culture. A negative premium suggests low demand from South Korean investors, potentially adding to the market’s uncertainty. Net Realized Profit And Loss Trends Another key metric Taha focused on is Bitcoin’s net realized profit and loss (NRPL), which tracks market participants’ total net profit or loss. Positive NRPL values indicate that more investors are taking profits, while negative values suggest more losses are being realized. Currently, the NRPL is approaching a critical $4 billion mark. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: This Week’s Trends And Historical Patterns For Q4 Taha highlighted that crossing the $4 billion threshold in past market cycles has often coincided with significant market peaks or troughs. The red line marking the $4 billion level across the chart (above) represents a key point of market activity. According to the analyst, when NRPL crosses this line, it can indicate a surge in trading activity as more investors either lock in their profits or cut their losses. Taha further pointed out that these points have historically been pivotal moments in Bitcoin’s price action, and the current proximity to this level suggests that another significant market movement could be on the horizon.

The emirate projects itself as a crypto hub, and has recently given licenses to crypto exchanges Binance, OKX and Crypto.com.  Dubai's Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), one of the bodies overseeing the crypto industry in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), said it fined seven ""entities"" for operating without the required licenses and for breaching marketing regulations.  The regulator also issued cease-and-desist orders to the entities, it announced on Wednesday.  VARA did not reveal the names of the entities, and said it is investigating them together with local authorities. The fines imposed range from 50,000 dirhams ($13,600) to 100,000 dirhams each.

Some analysts believe WLD’s price could continue to move sideways before recovering its bullish momentum. Related Reading: Experts Discuss What Made Solana Memecoins The Cycle’s Top Narrative Alameda Goes On A Worldcoin Sell-off On-chain data analysis firm SpotOnChain revealed that Alameda Research has sent part of its WLD holdings to crypto exchanges for the past two months. The report shared that, since early August, FTX’s sister company has transferred 1.56 million WLD tokens to Binance. The firm has sent around 143,770 WLD tokens, worth around $2.51 million, every week since August 9, selling the tokens in 10 batches at an average price of $1.6. The news came two days after US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved FTX’s repayment plan. The approval allows the crypto exchange to pay customers between $14.7 billion and $16.5 billion in recovered crypto assets. Alameda received around $8 billion of FTX users’ misappropriated funds, allegedly used for the fund’s trading operations. Some suggest that the sell-off is linked to FTX’s repayment plan, which is expected to start soon and could signify further selling pressure from the companies. Per SpotOnChain’s report, Alameda’s wallet holds 23.44 million WLD tokens worth around $43 million. At its current selling rate, it could take over three years to completely unload Alameda’s Worldcoin holdings. Additionally, other altcoins could face selling pressure from the company. The wallet holds $98.8 million in other cryptocurrencies, including 100.9 million Stargate Finance (STG), 1.78 million Mantle (MNT), and 98.86 million BitDAO (BIT), now MNT. The company’s BIT holdings, valued at $68 million, could start being sold in November, as the 3-year no-sale commitment with BitDAO ends. WLD Price Reacts To The News Following the sell-off report, Worldcoin saw a 6% dip in the daily timeframe. The token’s price dropped from the $1.98 mark to the $1.77 support zone in the last 24 hours, representing a 4.5% decline in WLD’s biweekly performance. The cryptocurrency registered a remarkable 31% weekly surge in late September after Worldcoin announced its expansion to three new countries. As reported by NewsBTC, the crypto project revealed it was bringing its World ID services to Guatemala, Poland, and Malaysia. The news, alongside the crypto market’s recovery, propelled the token’s price above the $2 mark, which was momentarily held. Since then, the token has struggled to reclaim the key support zone, hovering between $1.58-$2.03 levels for the past week.

Factors To Propel Bitcoin To $80,000 Hougan highlighted three essential conditions that could push BTC to new all-time highs (ATH) in 2024. First, he pointed to November’s upcoming U.S. presidential elections, which could influence BTC’s future price trajectory. According to Hougan, anything other than a Democratic sweep would benefit the top cryptocurrency by market cap. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst: Bull Market Hinges On This Indicator Reaching 45% In the memo, Hougan explained that while many view the election as a binary choice – with Republican candidate Donald Trump favorable for the crypto industry and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris seen as detrimental – the reality on the Democratic side is more nuanced. He said: The Democratic Party has disparate views on crypto, from Senator Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass.) “Anti-Crypto Army” to Representative Ritchie Torres’ (D-N.Y.) deep support. The problem of the past four years is that the Warren wing has controlled policy and agency appointments, and that has created a hostile environment for the sector. Hougan expressed confidence in the Republicans, stating that a win for them would “undoubtedly” be positive for crypto. However, he also referenced a recent comment by Democrat Maxine Waters, who said that “crypto is inevitable,” suggesting that Democrats may become more open to digital assets. Second, Hougan brought attention to the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) interest rate cuts. On September 18, the Fed lowered key interest rates by 50 basis points (bps), sparking a crypto rally. Further, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) decision to inject economic stimulus into the Chinese economy gave more fuel to digital assets to propel. Hougan noted that the market expects another 50 bps rate cut from the Fed before year-end, along with additional Chinese fiscal stimulus. The crypto market could see a strong Q4 2024 rally if both occur. Finally, Hougan mentioned that a period with no major surprises would support BTC’s potential rally to $80,000. He concluded that negative surprises, such as a significant crypto exchange hack, new lawsuits, or the release of previously locked coins could derail this momentum. Key Ingredient For The Rip To $100,000 BTC Hougan also stated that growing pro-crypto sentiment would be necessary for BTC to reach the ambitious $100,000 target in the coming months. Related Reading: Bitcoin Tumbles Following Higher Than Anticipated US Core Inflation Data He recalled the famous “DeFi summer” of 2020 as an example and envisions a similar market-wide shift toward crypto, driven by the rising use of stablecoins, high-throughput blockchains, and innovation in passive yield solutions. In related news, CEO of crypto mining firm CleanSpark, Zach Bradford, recently opined that Bitcoin could reach as high as $200,000 in the next 18 months given the right conditions. That being said, recent geopolitical escalations in the Middle East can adversely impact risk-on assets such as stocks and crypto in the short term. BTC trades at $61,999 at press time, down 1.4% in the last 24 hours.

42407430,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gZHS3R,1728552266,"Bitcoin, Ether Nurse Losses as Dollar Strengthens Ahead of U.S. Inflation Report","BTC, ETH recover from overnight lows, but remain in the red on a 24-hour basis.  The rallying dollar might be weighing on the crypto market, according to one analyst.  A hotter-than-expected U.S. inflation report would weaken the case for Fed rate cuts.  The crypto market was listless during the European morning as a hawkish rethink of the odds of outsized Fed interest-rate cuts kept the U.S. dollar bid ahead of a pivotal inflation report.  Bitcoin {{BTC}}, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, traded near $61,000, slightly higher than the overnight low of $60,400 but still down more than 1.5% over 24 hours. Ether {{ETH}} saw similar price action, trading 1.9% lower at $2,395. Other major alternative cryptocurrencies, BNB and SOL, traded 1% lower, with XRP down 0.6%, according to CoinDesk data.  The dollar index (DXY), which gauges the greenback's exchange rate against major fiat currencies, rose to 102.97, the highest since Aug. 16, taking the cumulative gain since the Sept. 30 low of 100.18 to 2.7%, according to data source TradingView.  The CME's FedWatch tool showed traders assigning an 85% probability to the Fed cutting interest rates by 25 basis points at its Nov. 7 meeting instead of 65% a week ago. Back then, markets saw a 35% chance of the Fed delivering another 50 basis-point cut by year-end, having made the first in September.  Friday's blowout nonfarm jobs report revived the ""U.S. exceptionalism"" story, forcing traders to reassess expectations for faster and bigger rate reductions.  The minutes from the September Fed meeting, released Wednesday, showed policymakers were divided on how aggressive the central bank should be. ""A substantial majority of participants"" favored cutting by half a percentage point, though some expressed misgivings about going that large, the minutes said.  ""Crypto sentiment has moved back into the fear zone (39), reinforcing the contrast with 72 (greed) in equities,"" Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst at FxPro, said in an email. ""This dynamic is easily explained by the appreciation of the dollar and the increased attractiveness of bonds, which reduces institutional traction in bitcoin.""  Kuptsikevich said Thursday's U.S. inflation report could breed market volatility if it deviates from expectations.  The data due at 12:30 UTC is expected to show the consumer price index rose 0.1% month-on-month and 2.3% year-on-year in September, following August's 0.2% month-on-month and 2.5% year-on-year. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, is forecast to print at 0.2% month-on-month and 3.2% year-on-year, according to FXStreet.  Hotter-than-expected CPI prints could strengthen calls to stop rate cuts, potentially adding to DXY's upward momentum and leading to risk aversion.  ING, however, said early this week that the CPI won't lead to material changes in the market positioning, given the Fed's focus has shifted to the labor market.",NEGATIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/10/bitcoin-ether-nurse-losses-as-dollar-strengthens-ahead-of-us-inflation-report,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/618a00767127bb1370d6b9b03256e66fce21a056-2710x1214.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34523673,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647155,1728547207,"Could XRP Finally Hit $1? Key Factors To Consider, According To Analysts","Many XRP holders expect the altcoin to break $1 soon. XRP has traded around $0.50 for a while despite lingering pressure in the crypto market. Some analysts recently predicted that XRP’s long-awaited bull run will commence as Bitcoin’s dominance declines. Related Reading: $6 Million ETH Sale: Ethereum Foundation Joins Whale Liquidation Frenzy XRP Price Forecast: Positive Signs Ahead? The current price projections for XRP from CoinCheckup suggest a bullish trajectory. Analysts anticipate a 14% increase in the altcoin over the next three months, despite the fact that it is currently trading 18.77% below the estimate for the following month. This modest ascent can be a precursor of a sustainable rally, which will present traders with steady increases. XRP is seen climbing 150% in the next half-year period and 125% by 2025. The positive forecasts for this coin, therefore, suggest that this is the beginning of a strong price growth phase, courtesy of increased consumer confidence and broader adoption. Very crucial for #XRP to close this weekly candle above 55 cents or else we’ll test the support at 40 cents. The #Bitcoin dominance is almost near the top and once it starts dumping we’ll see all #Altcoins pull a 2-5x easy. Just accumulate coming year is very bullish! #Crypto pic.twitter.com/Dk0ARRnjE9 — THE GOAT TRADERS (@TheGoatTraders) October 6, 2024 Key Resistance Levels To Watch Even with these positive outlooks, XRP still has to break over a few significant resistance levels before a real bull run can start. The “GOAT” trader pointed out that in order for XRP to keep moving higher and hit $1, it needs to close above $0.55 on the weekly chart. If it fails, the altcoin might fall as low as $0.40, testing crucial support levels before attempting another rally. Another technical analyst, “Charting Guy,” has joined in, suggesting that XRP’s price movement will be greatly influenced by Bitcoin’s performance. According to him, XRP will trade between $0.43 and $0.67 until Bitcoin overcomes its $70K resistance. for people asking me when will $XRP moon or is it over, etc etc. i will repeat for the millionth time$XRP and other lagging altcoins will do NOTHING significant until $BTC breaks into price discovery it’ll range between 0.43 – 0.67 until then monthly bollinger bands continue… pic.twitter.com/GwSrwJEDI0 — Charting Guy (@ChartingGuy) October 6, 2024 Bitcoin’s Impact On XRP’s Future Bitcoin has been in a quite limited trading range and has not yet broken beyond $70,000. Although the top coin peaked in March at $73K, it struggled to maintain the level and finally encountered continuous obstacles that is preventing it from reaching a new price discovery phase. So long as Bitcoin is below this crucial level, Altcoins that are underperforming, such as XRP could continue to trade sideways. According to Charting Guy, breaking resistance would be the critical support for the upward trajectory of XRP. Related Reading: Analyst Foresees 90% Cardano Price Drop in Next 6 Months Bollinger Band Tightening: What It Means For The Altcoin Meanwhile, XRP’s Bollinger Bands have tightened on the monthly chart. This tightening typically indicates that a significant price shift is approaching. Charting Guy speculated that if XRP closes over $0.67, it might spark a big rise. On the other hand, a monthly close below $0.43 could result in a significant drop. Investors should keep a close eye on these important levels to see where XRP may go next.

The recent onset of the Fed rate-cutting cycle poses risk to the uptrend in the BTC dominance rate.  The U.S. Federal Reserve's (Fed) rate-cutting cycle may stall the ongoing prolonged uptrend in bitcoin's {{BTC}} dominance rate, bringing wider gains in the crypto market, according to crypto asset manager SwissOne Capital.  BTC's dominance rate, or the cryptocurrency's share in the total market capitalization, has increased from 38% to 58% in two years, according to data source TradingView. In other words, BTC has seen faster gains relative to the wider market, leading the doubling of the total digital asset market value to over $2 trillion.  Per SwissOne Capital, there is now limited scope for further upside in BTC's dominance rate as the Fed has recently cut rates by 50 basis points, kicking off a so-called easing cycle.  ""Bitcoin Dominance is positively correlated to the Fed Funds rate,"" SwissOne Capital said in a market update, noting the decline in the dominance rate during the previous rate cutting cycles.  The chart shows bitcoin's dominance peaked above 70% and turned lower with the start of the easing cycle in the second half of 2019.  The metric fell to nearly 40% in late 2021 as central banks worldwide and governments injected trillions into the financial system to cushion against the impact of coronavirus, leading to unprecedented risk-taking in all corners of the financial market, including alternative cryptocurrencies (altcoins), or tokens other than BTC.  The positive correlation between the two was also evident through the 2022-23 and 2018 rate hike cycles.  ""The recent start of the U.S. rate cutting cycle certainly points to little further upside if history is to repeat itself,"" SwissOne Capital noted.  Per CME's FedWatch tool, traders expect the Fed to reduce rates by another 25 basis points by the end of the year.  Lower highs  The BTC dominance rate has produced lower peaks since 2015 in a sign of broader market growth.  The latest two-year surge, though impressive, still leaves the metric well short of the previous peak of 73%. That's probably due to the explosive growth of stablecoin, reflected by a record market capitalization of $172 billion.  ""With stablecoin market caps close to 10% of total market cap we believe it explains why Bitcoin dominance could be topping between current levels and 60% (maximum) before a major reversal ensues,"" SwissOne Capital said.",NEGATIVE,BTC,ALTCOIN | BTC | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/10/10/uptrend-in-bitcoins-dominance-rate-threatened-by-fed-rate-cut-cycle-crypto-asset-manager-says,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af5533562893e00a029eaace0996b96eacade301-1905x1072.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

34521055,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647144,1728541825,"Bitcoin Price Fails At MA-200, Is A Crash To $52,000 Coming?","Following its brief stint above $66,000, the Bitcoin price fall had put it below multiple important levels. This allowed the bears to thrive as they reclaimed control of the largest cryptocurrency by market cap once again. Even now, as the Bitcoin price looks toward some recovery, the bear camp continue to wax stronger, with a most recent failure to break the MA-200, suggesting that the uptrend may only be temporary and a larger crash could be at play. Why The Bitcoin Price Failing At MA-200 Is Bad Crypto analyst RLinda revealed in a TradingView post that the Bitcoin price had actually tried to break the M1-200 level. This attempt took place on the daily chart with the price moving toward the $64,000-$65,000 resistance. However, the resistance at $64,000 proved too strong and the Bitcoin price was beaten down once again. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set To Rally Over 2430% To $0.000047 As Trend Oscillator Turns Bullish The product of this failure at the daily MA-200 now is that the Bitcoin price is now forming a descending channel. Naturally, this is bearish for the Bitcoin price given that descending channels are often messengers of a crash. Add in the fact that the price has broken a range boundary with a strong liquidity zone formed and the crypto analyst believes that the market could be headed further down. Since the bears remain in control, it seems to be a matter of when, not if, the Bitcoin price will retrace again. After this, the question of how low the price can go swims to the fore and the crypto analyst is currently looking at an at least 10% fall, which would push the price out of $60,000 again. The main resistance levels presented by the crypto analyst are $62,745 and $64,955. This means that this are the levels the Bitcoin price must successfully scale in order to confirm the uptrend. In comparison, RLinda puts support levels at $60,000, $59,250, and $57,700. If the BTC price is unable to sustain these levels, then the dip could be deeper than expected, possibly crashing as low as $52,000. How To Weaken The Bearish Pressure Another analyst who has highlighted the Bitcoin price failure to break the MA-200 is Alan Santana. He explains in his post that the fact that the cryptocurrency is now trading below this MA-200 has strengthened the bearish bias with a drop expected to follow. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 8,400% Rise For XRP Price To $44, Calls It ‘Conservative’ However, there are a couple of developments that could help to weaken the mounting bearish pressure. The first of these is if the Bitcoin price were able to close above $66,500 on the weekly chart. The second is if BTC is able to complete a monthly close above $71,000. Both of these scenarios would work to invalidate the bearish pressure that is currently mounting on the Bitcoin price. “As long as Bitcoin trades below 66,500 (short-term) or below 71,000 (long-term), the bearish bias remains intact,” the crypto analyst warned.

A CryptoQuant analyst under the pseudonym “datascope” recently posted on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, providing an in-depth analysis of Bitcoin’s current price movements. The analyst highlighted that Bitcoin is at a critical psychological turning point, where market sentiment could shift towards optimism or pessimism based on its trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Supply In Loss Nears 20%: Could This Trigger A Fresh Surge? Bitcoin Historical Patterns Suggest Optimism Could Persist According to datascope, Bitcoin’s price, which currently trades just above $62,000 is sitting in a range where historical data suggests that the market participants’ outlook can sway in either direction, depending on whether they are in profit. The analyst further explained that as long as Bitcoin stays within this critical range, the chances of a significant price decline are minimal. This “zone of optimism” range has been a determining factor in previous bull markets, most notably in 2016 and 2020. The CryptoQuant analyst emphasized that the “Supply in Profit” metric, which measures the portion of Bitcoin’s circulating supply held by investors who are in profit, is a vital indicator in understanding market sentiment. In the past, whenever a significant portion of Bitcoin’s supply was in profit, it resulted in an optimistic outlook, supporting the price to push higher. Bitcoin’s current position within this zone of optimism suggests that a continued rally could be in store if the price maintains stability. #Bitcoin at a Critical Psychological Turning Point “Bitcoin’s price is sitting at a psychologically important level. Historically, when prices stayed within this range, the market continued its upward trend.” – By @0xDataScope Read more 👇https://t.co/q6FzjuhRHS pic.twitter.com/ouZIuztaJd — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 9, 2024 Looking back at historical bull markets, the analyst pointed out that during the bull runs of 2016 and 2020, Bitcoin maintained its position between a psychological turning point and the optimism zone, allowing the market to enter a sustained upward trend. Key Indicators To Watch Moving Forward In addition to the “Supply in Profit” metric, the CryptoQuant analyst suggests monitoring the overall market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price movements in the coming days. Should Bitcoin stay within this critical psychological range, it is less likely to experience a significant price drop. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold this zone and breaks below, market sentiment could turn bearish, leading to a further price decline.

34515773,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647137,1728531006,Bitcoin ETF Inflows Jump To $235 Million – Is The Bull Market Heating Up?,"Bitcoin’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are once again generating headlines due to an extraordinary increase in inflows. An investment of $235.2 million in Bitcoin ETFs occurred on October 8, indicating a substantial increase in investor appetite. This surge, based on data from Farside Investors, follows a relatively uneventful beginning to the month, but it indicates a resurgence in investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Earns Recognition For Charitable Contributions – Impact On Price Fidelity And BlackRock Lead The Way This was led by Fidelity’s Bitcoin ETF (FBTC) with a $103.7 million inflow. iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), managed by BlackRock, received $97.9 million of inflows. Bitwise ETF BITB and ARK Invest ETF Arkb also joined with $13.1 million and $12.6 million respectively. The combined trading volume of all Bitcoin ETFs steadily grew to over a cool $1.22 billion up from just the other day. Given the erratic Bitcoin values, the comeback in ETF inflows is especially remarkable. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $62,485 at the time of writing, somewhat declining from its previous high of $66,000 to show some bearish pressure. Notwithstanding the recent price drop, the strong demand for Bitcoin ETFs shows that institutional investors are ready to profit from possible future increases. Bitcoin Edges Ethereum ETFs Unlike the optimistic sentiment connected with Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum’s ETFs tell a different story: Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were on low inflows of $7.4 million on October 6 and had no new activity on October 7. This stagnation is quite different from the active movement within Bitcoin ETFs. Analysts point out that this difference could point to changing investor tastes or worries on Ethereum’s market dynamics. The lack of inflows into Ethereum ETFs brings even more questions about whether, at present, there is any better overall market sentiment toward altcoins. Investor interest in Ethereum has subsided somewhat, as indicated, though the phenomenon of Bitcoin draws enormous volumes of institutional capital. Market Sentiment And Future Outlook Recent increases in Bitcoin ETF inflows reflect the direction of a larger market trend resulting from conjecture over possible Federal Reserve rate reduction. Many investors think this move will strengthen the market and keep prices on the ascent. If history has anything to teach us, it is that such financial easing usually encourages additional investment in risk assets including cryptocurrency. Related Reading: BlackRock Declares Bitcoin The New ‘Gold Alternative’ – Here’s Why Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas emphasizes that, given the excellent performances of both FBTC and IBIT, they are going to be very important for the future of Bitcoin ETFs. They may even touch “stud level” with over $10 billion in assets under management. And by the end of 2024 in the fourth quarter, this institutional interest is on the rise which may well bring us the bull run. Ethereum’s ETFs are presently experiencing stagnation, despite the fact that Bitcoin ETFs are experiencing a resurgence that is characterized by significant inflows and increased trading volumes. Investors are closely monitoring the market as they prepare for potential changes that may result from evolving market dynamics and changes in monetary policy. As they jointly navigate these turbulent waters, the next few weeks will be critical for both Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle,"Crypto analyst James has compared Dogecoin (DOGE) and Bitcoin (BTC) and provided insights into what to expect from these major cryptocurrencies in this market cycle. Based on his analysis, the foremost meme coin will likely outperform the flagship cryptocurrency in this bull run. What To Expect From Dogecoin And Bitcoin In This Cycle James suggested in an X post that Dogecoin will likely outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. The analyst noted that since Dogecoin’s launch in 2013, the foremost meme coin has consistently outperformed the flagship crypto in every cycle despite the over 90% drawdowns witnessed in those cycles. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive 8,400% Rise For XRP Price To $44, Calls It ‘Conservative’ The analyst also highlighted the performances of these coins since their inception. He noted that most of Bitcoin’s gain came during its first cycle, likely because it was the first cryptocurrency. However, since then, Bitcoin’s gains have decreased over the last three cycles. Meanwhile, Dogecoin has enjoyed price gains in every successive market cycle. The foremost meme coin is said to have surged by over 54,000% in the 2018 bull market and a price gain of over 54,800% in the 2021 bull run. In line with this, James is confident that Dogecoin will again surpass its previous two cycles’ percentage gains while Bitcoin will record smaller gains in this bull run compared to the previous cycles. Interestingly, the analyst asserted that Dogecoin is the “stronger cryptocurrency and is poised to take over the world.” Like James, crypto analysts like Kevin Capital and Crypto Kaleo also previously predicted that Dogecoin will outperform Bitcoin in this market cycle. More recently, crypto analyst Master Kenobi also echoed a similar sentiment, citing Dogecoin’s historical performance and community-driven momentum as the reason it will outperform the flagship crypto. The Foremost Meme Coin Is Lagging Behind Despite these bullish predictions for Dogecoin, it is worth mentioning that the foremost meme coin is currently lagging behind the flagship crypto in this market cycle. CoinMarketCap data shows that the meme coin boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of just over 21% compared to Bitcoin, which has recorded a price gain of over 47%. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Set To Rally Over 2430% To $0.000047 As Trend Oscillator Turns Bullish Moreover, the flagship crypto already hit a new all-time high (ATH) in this bull run. Meanwhile, Dogecoin is still way below its current ATH of $0.7. However, considering James’ analysis that the meme coin has outperformed Bitcoin in previous cycles despite suffering a 90% drawdown, there remains the possibility that DOGE will still top BTC in this market cycle. Analysts like Crypto Kaleo, Kevin, and Master Kenobi have all predicted that Dogecoin could reach $1 in this bull run. That represents a price gain of over 500% from its current price. Therefore, DOGE will likely outperform BTC if it eventually reaches this price target.

34511431,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647176,1728522031,FTX Bankruptcy: Key Dates For The $16 Billion Payout And Potential Market Effects,"On Monday, a US bankruptcy court officially approved the liquidation plan for cryptocurrency exchange FTX, allowing the company to repay its customers using approximately $16 billion in recovered assets. This decision comes at a critical time for the crypto market, as creditors are poised to receive more than $12 billion through the court-sanctioned payout plan, raising the possibility that some of these funds could be reinvested into the digital asset ecosystem, potentially influencing market prices. Market Awaits FTX Liquidation Impact In June, FTX reported having $12.6 billion available for customer repayments, a figure that could increase to $16.5 billion as additional assets are identified and liquidated. The initial distribution of around $1.1 billion, while relatively modest, is expected to provide support for Bitcoin (BTC) and other cryptocurrencies such as Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH), according to Alex Thorn, the head of research at Galaxy Digital Holdings. Related Reading: ETH’s Fate Hinges On $2,300: Will Ethereum Soar To $6,000 Or Dive To $1,600? Benjamin Celermajer, co-chief investment officer at Magnet Capital, also noted that the upcoming payouts “effectively provide liquidity to known crypto traders”. He highlighted the likelihood that some of these funds will flow back into the cryptocurrency market, potentially acting as a price catalyst for “liquidity-starved assets.” However, it is important to note that the repayments from FTX will not occur immediately. Bloomberg reports that the exchange must establish a trust and hire a company to oversee the distribution process. Repayments Expected To Take Years? Galaxy Digital says payments to smaller creditors may begin as early as December, while larger claims will be addressed in the first half of next year. Some remaining claims could take up to three years to resolve. Research firm K33 has estimated a “latent demand from FTX reallocators” of around $2.4 billion. However, they caution that the impact on the crypto market may be “soft” due to the staggered nature of the repayments expected over the next year. Related Reading: Crypto Whale Turns $2 Into Over $100 Million: Here’s How He Did It In a related development, Caroline Ellison, the former CEO of FTX’s trading arm, Alameda Research, has agreed to hand over her assets to the exchange’s debtors to settle a claim brought against her by the FTX bankruptcy estate. Ellison has reached a settlement that includes the transfer of her assets that have not already been confiscated by the government or used for legal fees, FTX said in a court filing on Monday. Ellison, who is also the former romantic partner of the now convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, also agreed to cooperate with the bankruptcy estate in current and future investigations. Upon completion of the settlement, Ellison will retain only certain physical personal property. When writing, the defunct exchange’s native token FTT is trading at $2.25, down from an 8-month high of $3 reached after the bankruptcy plan was approved on Monday.

34510557,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=647114,1728520242,Cardano (ADA) Testing $0.34 Support – On-Chain Data Suggests Price Consolidation,"Cardano (ADA) is now at a crucial price level after weeks of intense volatility and uncertainty. Following a dramatic series of price swings—first a 27% surge, then a 20% retrace, then a 10% rise, and now a 7% dip to $0.34—Cardano finds itself at one of its most critical support levels. Holding this level is essential for bulls to maintain momentum and avoid a deeper decline. Related Reading: Dogecoin Analyst Expects A ‘Multi-Year Bullish Breakout’ – 200% Surge Potential Market data from Coinglass indicates that ADA may be entering a consolidation phase, often preceding a significant price move. Investors and traders closely watch this level, as it could determine whether Cardano is poised for a bullish breakout or a deeper correction. With the entire crypto market in a state of anticipation, ADA’s upcoming price action will be key in signaling its next trend. As sentiment remains mixed, this consolidation period will likely set the tone for Cardano’s direction in the coming weeks. Cardano Funding Rate Suggests Market Consolidation Cardano (ADA) is showing signs of entering a potential consolidation phase, a crucial moment for investors as they evaluate the next move. Recent on-chain data highlights a surge in large transactions followed by stabilization, suggesting that the market is cooling off after weeks of volatility. This stabilization could pave the way for more balanced price action as ADA hovers around a key support level. Coinglass data further reinforces the consolidation narrative. The ADA Open Interest (OI)-Weighted Funding Rate has declined yet remains positive. A declining but positive funding rate indicates that demand for ADA is slowing down, but not to a degree where the market expects heavy short-selling. In crypto, when funding rates dip but stay in positive territory, the market consolidates rather than preparing for a sharp downward movement. This suggests that while ADA’s upward momentum has slowed, there isn’t yet an overwhelming bearish sentiment. Related Reading: Bitcoin Failed Attempt To Break $64,000 Could Lead To A Disaster – Analyst If ADA manages to hold above current levels during this consolidation phase, it would signal healthy price action. The key is whether bulls can defend these levels, potentially leading to a more sustained rally in the weeks ahead. Investors must monitor these indicators closely as the market tests ADA’s resilience. ADA Testing Crucial Support Cardano (ADA) is currently trading at $0.34 after failing to reclaim two critical levels: the 4-hour 200 moving average (MA) at $0.356 and the 200 exponential moving average (EMA) at $0.359. These indicators are crucial for ADA to regain bullish momentum, and their rejection signals potential weakness in the price action. Despite this, ADA is still holding above a key support level at $0.34. If this level is lost, the price could face a significant retracement, with lower demand levels around $0.32 and potentially $0.30 being tested. This makes the $0.34 support critical for maintaining current market sentiment. Conversely, if ADA can reclaim the 4-hour 200 MA and 200 EMA, breaking above $0.36, it could set the stage for a rally toward higher resistance levels. The next significant supply zone to watch would be around $0.41, where further bullish momentum could face its next challenge. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Reclaim $2,700 As Key Data Signals Reduced Selling Pressure The coming days will be pivotal for ADA as it consolidates and prepares for its next move.
