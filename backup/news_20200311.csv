42404158,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUJK,1583963041,"As NY Fed Promises More Cash, What Will Christine Lagarde Do?","Bitcoin (BTC) prices slid for a fifth straight day, but the decline paled in comparison with the steep sell-off seen in traditional financial markets. New warnings from authorities over the growing risks from the spreading coronavirus sent stocks reeling, leading to fresh promises of cash injections from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.      The largest cryptocurrency by market value slid 0.5 percent to $7,846 as of 20:20 UTC (4:20 p.m. Eastern time). It was the lowest price in two months, and the decline trimmed bitcoin’s year-to-date gains to 9.5 percent.      Yet, the price drop in bitcoin was nowhere near the severity seen in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index plunging nearly 5 percent. The sell-off on Wall Street was so broad that even gold, seen by many investors as a reliable safe haven in times of economic and market distress, slid 1 percent to $1,644 an ounce.      Governments and central banks around the world moved to provide new aid packages and monetary stimulus to blunt the economic impact of the contagion. The virus, and efforts to contain it, have led to widespread business disruptions and travel cancellations, while crimping supply chains for factories and sapping consumer confidence.      The New York Fed, the biggest among the Federal Reserve’s 12 regional branches, said in a statement Wednesday afternoon it would increase an overnight lending program for Wall Street bond dealers for the second time this week. The cap on the short-term loans, which the firms rely on to supplement cash when market liquidity is tight, will now increase to $175 billion, from the $150 billion set on Monday. Previously, the so-called “repo” loans were capped at $100 billion.      And in a move that was would have been unthinkable until recently, the European Central Bank could slash its benchmark interest rate, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase. The biggest U.S. bank predicted the ECB, led by President Christine Lagarde, could decide Thursday after a meeting in Frankfurt to also boost its “quantitative easing” asset-purchasing program to 40 billion euros ($22 billion) a month from the current pace of 20 billion euros.      “What you’re really seeing at a global level is this oscillation between risk-on and risk-off as you get this progressive disclosure of how bad is the actual virus, and also how bad is the response,” said Mike Alfred, co-founder and CEO of the cryptocurrency-focused data provider Digital Assets Data. “There’s going to be a lot more days like the last few days over the next few months.”    Merkel’s dire prediction    The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus to be a pandemic, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a news conference in Berlin that some 60 percent to 70 percent of the population could become infected in the country of 82 million citizens.      Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a congressional hearing in Washington the coronavirus is at least 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu, even if the mortality rate ends up being lower than the World Health Organization’s current estimate of 3.4 percent, according to CNBC.    Central banks contemplate next steps    The Bank of England took the emergency step of slashing interest rates to support the economy, coordinated with a U.K. government announcement of a new 30 billion-pound ($39 billion) fiscal stimulus package.      Bank of America said Wednesday in a report the Federal Reserve, led by Chair Jerome Powell, might move as soon as next week to announce monetary-stimulus measures similar to those used in the financial crisis over a decade ago. In a matter of months in 2008, from August to December, the Fed’s balance sheet doubled in size to more than $2 trillion, and it doubled again during the next few years to over $4 trillion.    Bitcoin ‘not immune’    Digital Assets Data’s Alfred drew a contrast between breadth of official responses in traditional markets and the absence of any changes in the computer-based protocol governing the decentralized blockchain network that bitcoin runs on. The system was designed 11 years ago with hard and specific rules that stipulate the pace of issuance of new units of the cryptocurrency.      Indeed, many bitcoin investors say the digital asset’s price is likely to rise this year in conjunction with an upcoming, once-every-four-years “halving,” where the number of new bitcoins issued per new data block “mined” – roughly every 10 minutes or so – will decline by half to 6.25 from 12.5. It’s such a widely anticipated event that members of the cryptocurrency community have even created Internet-based countdown clocks to chronicle the event, now just 60 days away. That puts it on or around May 11.      “You would expect that to be a positive for bitcoin,” said Mark Warner, head of trading for London-based BCB Group, a financial firm focused on digital assets.      Yet, in the current environment, there appears to be a rush by investors everywhere to avoid further losses, and bitcoin “is not immune,” Warner said. While he had expected recently that bitcoin’s price would find support around the $8,000 level, the market “blew through that.” He now sees potential support at $7,000, though he wouldn’t rule out a decline to $6,500.      “Looking at what the coronavirus is doing, as well as what oil prices have done, there's just chaos all over and people are derisking,” Warner said.      Greg Cipolaro, co-founder of the cryptocurrency-focused Digital Asset Research, told CoinDesk he has started keeping his own spreadsheet to track newly reported coronavirus cases. He’s watching for the moment when the number of new cases reported over the past seven days starts to fall below the number reported for the prior week.      “I think it's topical,” Cipolaro wrote in an email. “My personal opinion is that markets won't settle down until we slow the coronavirus growth rate, like China and Korean have done. Fears are running rampant, and exponential growth models are being forecasted out ad infinitum.”      Mati Greenspan, founder of the research firm Quantum Economics, which analyzes cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, wrote in an email to clients that it’s not unreasonable to expect bitcoin to trade in synch with stocks for the foreseeable future.      “This might come later on, once we understand more about the economic impact and how long it might take to see some sort of recovery,” Greenspan said.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Bradley Keoun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/11/as-ny-fed-promises-more-cash-what-will-christine-lagarde-do,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2b54ad09fc4a41dfb1ef87c04e56f118e8a570df-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404153,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUFO,1583962844,Why Energy Experts Are Watching Crypto as Oil Wars Emerge,"Global energy markets could impact the future of bitcoin, but not strictly in terms of supply or demand.      On the surface, the current oil market chaos may appear to be a power struggle between Russia and Saudi Arabia, which have differing views on whether to reduce production to accommodate the slowdown or bury the U.S. shale market by making it too expensive to keep up.      “Usually when oil is cheap, the dollar is stronger. But we haven’t seen that in this crisis because of the coronavirus,” said Fadi Aboualfa, managing director of the MEES energy newsletter.      There are rumors of Iranian efforts to use cryptocurrency to circumnavigate sanctions, potentially with deals related to commodities or oil markets. So far, Russia, China and Iran have been among the most proactive nations exploring the cryptocurrency space. Even as a top oil-producing country, Russia has historically been the odd man out of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), dominated by Saudi Arabia.      These days, among cryptocurrency fans in both Russia and China, the current sentiment is outright defiance.      “Big crypto mining pools are rejecting Iranian miners because of sanctions,” said Mikhael Jerlis, CEO of the Russian EMCD.IO mining pool. “We don't give a damn about sanctions. If we get sanctioned we’d just shut down the company and open a new one.”      Over the past three years, Saudi Arabia’s oil supply routes have increasingly come under fire. The kingdom’s hold on the shipping routes around Yemen started slipping, thanks to Iran-backed Houthi rebels conquering the most strategic parts of Yemen. It’s no wonder why, as oil markets fluctuate, the crypto-savvy alliance of China, Russia and Iran is growing impatient with U.S. sanctions and petro-dollar allies like Saudi Arabia.      “The dollar has weakened, mostly because China has been selling dollars quite liberally … in order to keep its own currency more or less stable,” said economist Daniel Lacalle. “I think there’s a part of it, in the energy markets, that is related to the tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia.”    Where bitcoin fits in    When it comes to the prospect of using bitcoin (BTC) instead of U.S. dollars in energy markets, there are many factors beyond banking sanctions.      Compared to energy markets, bitcoin is perhaps the least correlated asset on the global economic chessboard. Bitcoin’s current price of roughly $7,900 is almost double the price at this time last year, despite market slumps sparked by the coronavirus epidemic.      On the other hand, market conditions may complicate the compliance risks associated with bitcoin.      “You could argue they [gold and the dollar] are inversely correlated,” Aboualfa said. “That could be an indication of how bitcoin will be impacted if it’s deemed to be a store-of-value asset class.”      However, he added, most OPEC players view bitcoin as a “sanctions play,” not a store of value.      It’s unclear what role cryptocurrency will play in future markets, as both the least-correlated asset class and a political pawn in the sanctions rivalry. It might raise questions related to compliance on the tangible end of any significant trade, rather than the payment rails themselves.      Meanwhile, from the perspective of an anonymous bitcoin trader in Saudi Arabia, the U.S.-Saudi bloc of this conflict appears to be ignoring cryptocurrency as a tool for global trades.      “Barely anyone is talking about it,” he said of the kingdom these days.      With regards to the oil market rivalry, he added: “Everyone’s on standby to see the impact … it’s about who can hold their breath the longest.”      Meanwhile, energy experts say incumbents are complacent about the dominance of the U.S. dollar in oil markets while others may try to force change.      “China and Russia are already trying to move away from the petro-dollar contracts,” Aboualfa said. “But the U.S. [Navy] could just stop any ship that tries to import Iranian crude. It’s not really a monetary thing.”      Anna Baydakova contributed reporting.",NEUTRAL,BTC,ASIA | BTC | COMMODITY | MARKET | MINING,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/11/why-energy-experts-are-watching-crypto-as-oil-wars-emerge,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8745c1c8f9be25d9a6d177456845c7f7ee6dfcf-1500x965.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Rhule is said to have closed eight deals with the undercover agents – often in Seattle-area Starbucks cafes – for a sum total of $140,000 cash, according to the unsealed complaint. He faces an additional charge of conspiracy to produce and distribute marijuana.      The undercover agents also allegedly asked Rhule questions about monero (XMR), the privacy coin.      “Rhule explained to UCA-1 that monero operated under the same concept as any cryptocurrency and was verifiable on the blockchain with one important caveat: wallet addresses could not be tracked,” the complaint said. The defendant allegedly offered to convert bitcoin to monero for the agents and provided tips on using Tor and TAILS to further preserve anonymity.      Rhule appeared in Seattle before the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington on Tuesday, according to the Department of Justice Press release.      According to the complaint, the undercover agents recorded Rhule during the undercover operations.      Rhule allegedly never asked the agents the required “know your customer” questions that FinCEN-licensed money transmitters must ask clients, from which, of course, he had no licensing. He was also allegedly indifferent to the agents' stated use of the funds.      “Rhule conducted these transactions even after the undercover agent explained that at least a portion of the cash involved represented proceeds of human trafficking,” the complaint said.      The agents had found him through LocalBitcoins username after searching for in-person cash dealmakers. Rhule is the latest LocalBitcoins user to be prosecuted on charges of running an unlicensed money transmission business. LocalBitcoins no longer offers the cash for crypto trading option.      HSI, a subset of the United State’s hulking Department of Homeland Security, has an interest in prosecuting unregistered money transmitters when it comes to crypto crime.      The investigative unit’s National Bulk Cash Smuggling Center developed an intelligence program designed for sniffing out violators across internet forums and dark markets in the summer of 2018. Called the “Cryptocurrency Intelligence Program,” (CIP) it is now part of every HSI crypto investigation.      But Rhule’s case slightly predates CIP’s debut. Agents first reached out to him in April 2018, according to the complaint.",NEGATIVE,BTC | XMR,BTC | BUSINESS | SPONSORED | TRADING | XMR,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/11/us-homeland-security-charges-localbitcoins-seller-with-money-laundering,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6522f48bb6d4be33bb0d2b2e87d9560aa317fd5a-1420x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404155,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUHM,1583960452,Binance Stablecoin BUSD Tops $100M but Lags Behind Rivals,"Binance USD, a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, has surpassed $100 million in market capitalization, chipping away at a market still dominated by Tether's TUSD.      Also known as BUSD, the token is traded almost exclusively on the Binance exchange and its market cap - which roughly corresponds to the total value of dollars deposited with its issuer, Paxos - is currently at $115 million. Binance USD runs on top of the Ethereum blockchain.      Stablecoins are blockchain-based and tied to traditional assets or currencies, such as U.S. dollars. They are used for trading on cryptocurrency exchanges, generally where crypto/fiat pairs are unavailable due to regulatory or banking reasons. BUSD is backed by U.S. dollars in an FDIC-insured U.S. bank and audited on a monthly basis.      Binance is one such exchange where one cannot trade cryptocurrencies using dollars. Therefore, stablecoins like BUSD are important to its business. It lists several other stablecoins, including Tether (USDT), which has much higher volume on Binance than BUSD. In fact, the majority of trading in BUSD, almost 40 percent market, is with Tether while the BUSD/BTC trading pair is second at 35 percent, according to data from CoinGecko.      Almost every asset listed on Binance is paired with Tether, and its volumes are substantial. For example, the USDT/BTC pair had $611 million in volume the past 24 hours. The BUSD/BTC pair only had $16 million in volume during that time.      Yet, BUSD, with its promising early gains, has a shot at being the dollar-backed crypto asset to beat. New York-based Paxos told CoinDesk that BUSD’s market capitalization has grown by more than 400 percent in the past month to $115 million from $22 million.      “The spectacular growth of BUSD shows that the market is hungry for an alternative. We're excited about this milestone and proud to partner with Binance to deliver an optimal solution for our global users,” Paxos co-founder Rich Teo said in a statement Wednesday.      Stablecoin titan Tether, with a market cap of $4.6 billion, is facing a battle with New York's Attorney General in a court case delving into its financial practices. Tether has never issued a full audit of its reserves, although it does have a regularly updated transparency page.      In addition to BUSD, other bank-audited stablecoins include the Circle and Coinbase-backed USDC, which has a $406 million market cap. Paxos also has its own branded stablecoin, Paxos Standard, which has a $206 million market capitalization.",POSITIVE,USDT,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | BNB,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/11/binance-stablecoin-busd-tops-100m-but-lags-behind-rivals,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8e8fae70b0af8d8650e6dcbce6291b0bd34321ec-1000x750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Meanwhile, China’s quarantine of the 11 million people in Wuhan was three weeks old and expanding to other parts of the country.

42404167,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhURC,1583956507,"Russia Seeks to Block 'Darknet' Technologies, Including Telegram's Blockchain","A Russian government agency has requested contractor bids to find ways to block censorship-resistant internet technologies, like mesh networks. The list includes messaging app company Telegram’s yet-to-be-launched blockchain.      The call for bids was published on March 3 by the General Radio Frequency Center, the agency controlling the use of radio frequencies in Russia, and first reported by the Russian-language cryptocurrency news outlet Forklog.      According to the notice, the agency is looking for research on what technologies can be used to access restricted content, including content deemed extremist, beyond traditional internet protocols.      The research should point at ways to block access to such tech, the agency told would-be contractors.      The list of such technologies in the document includes mesh networks, internet of things (IoT) protocols and protocols allowing anonymous browsing, including Invisible Internet Project (I2P), The Onion Router (TOR), Freenet, Zeronet, anoNet – and one blockchain, the Telegram Open Network (TON).      Such technologies are “used to build anonymous Darknet networks,” according to the agency. Bitcoin (BTC) isn't mentioned, nor any other cryptocurrencies.     'Unblockable'    It’s not clear how the list was formed. TON could have been included because the blockchain network Telegram has been building is designed to support applications for peer-to-peer networks (TON P2P Network), website hosting (TON DNS) and anonymity (TON Proxy).      According to the TON white paper, such a system, once launched in full, would allow browsing beyond the restrictions imposed by state actors on the service providers. “User network anonymity can be easily preserved by means of TON Proxy, and all services will be effectively unblockable,” the white paper said.      Even as Telegram is currently mired in a legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is seeking to halt TON’s launch, there are signs the company keeps rolling out the components of the future network. Last week, Telegram published instructions for registering websites using TON DNS.      The General Radio Frequency Center did not respond to CoinDesk’s request for comment by press time.      Telegram has a history of confronting Russia’s authorities, which have tried to control the app or shut it down. In 2017, Russia’s counterintelligence agency, the Federal Security Service (FSB), demanded Telegram share the encryption key for its flagship messenger app. Telegram lost in court trying to fight that requirement but refused to hand over the keys anyway.      Since the summer of 2017, Roscomnadzor, the General Radio Frequency Center's supervising agency, has been trying to block Telegram in Russia but failed. Telegram used a technique called domain fronting, hiding its traffic behind other services’ domains.      As a result, while chasing Telegram, Roscomnadzor kept misfiring, blocking multiple other websites but not Telegram and provoking the anger of internet users and a wave of memes.    Iron Curtain games    As for the future TON network, according to Mitja Goroshevsky, the CTO of TON Labs, the startup working on tools for TON developers, blocking TON would be even a trickier task.      “Even if there is an 'Iron Curtain' and all the communication channels with the outside world are blocked, chances to block it are around 5 percent,“ Goroshevsky said, pointing out that even during the Cold War people tuned into U.S. radio stations including Voice of America or Radio Liberty using home transistors.      “It’s gonna be just a new disgrace for Roscomnadzor,” he said.      And to interfere with the network itself, no less than 30 percent of all validators would have to be compromised, and most validators will most likely be located outside of Russia, Goroshevsky said.      The reason being, in Russia, there are no big cloud service providers like Google or Amazon, plus the risk of arbitrary blocking discourages validators from relying on Russia-based servers, he said.      In the meantime, Russia recently tested a mechanism for unplugging its segment of the internet from the rest of the world, following a law calling for a “sovereign Runet"" similar to China's Great Firewall.",NEGATIVE,BTC | TON,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | REGULATION | RESEARCH | TON,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/11/russia-seeks-to-block-darknet-technologies-including-telegrams-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7a8a7aef9c22e8b470f129630f95cc5b3f3b85a6-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404159,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhULI,1583948787,New York Crypto Companies Move to 'Work From Home' in Face of Rising COVID-19 Threat,"Kadena CEO Will Martino had already been considering abandoning his blockchain development company’s Brooklyn headquarters before coronavirus came to New York City. The fast-spreading virus, however, recently convinced him the office had to go. On Feb. 21, he told his team to begin working from home.      The New York metropolitan area’s surging coronavirus count is forcing more of the region’s cryptocurrency and blockchain companies to prepare for an unsavory reality: Their offices may close without warning and their employees may need to begin working remotely. CDC officials say “social distancing” can slow the spread of the virus, also known as COVID-19, which the World Health Organization classified as a global “pandemic” on Wednesday.      At press time, more than 200 residents of New York state had tested positive for coronavirus, the majority clustered in the now-quarantined New Rochelle suburb just north of New York City. New Jersey has also begun reporting an uptick in confirmed cases.      But the 8.6 million-person financial hub, too, is beginning to find signs that a wider outbreak may be coming, with instances of community transmission popping up across the five boroughs. that make up New York City On Sunday, Mayor Bill de Blasio recommended commuters begin considering working from home rather than taking frequently crowded subway trains to work.      Against this backdrop, local companies are beginning to implement new or existing pandemic playbooks.      Kadena acted quickly, in part because it had been mulling a remote model for some time, Martino said. After completing R&D on its Layer 1 solution for scaling public blockchains, which Martino said necessitated a physical office, the 15-person team began to consider decentralization.      “Coronavirus made the choice pretty easy,” Martino said. The company now uses web tools like Slack and video conferencing in place of in-person interactions.    Fast-moving situation    Most firms surveyed by CoinDesk on Tuesday have not yet enforced mandatory work-from-home policies. Their actions have been more suggestive than declarative, leaving employees with the option to work remotely if they want but not requiring they do so.      The Winklevoss twins’ Gemini exchange has asked at-risk employees to begin working remotely, as well as anyone with concerns about their health and safety. Communications Chief Carolyn Vadino said the firm trialed its continuity plan in December.      Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis sends its employees home each night with their laptops and chargers in tow and is imploring them to “elbow bump or wave” in place of the traditional – but germ-spreading – handshake. None are allowed to travel; anyone feeling sick is urged to stay home. Communications Director Maddie Kennedy began encouraging employees to work from home on Tuesday morning.      Decentralized web startup Blockstack began “encouraging” its employees to work remotely on Monday, said the company’s human resources lead Tom Gerrity. And Tagomi, a cryptocurrency prime broker, is now doing the same, according to Ryan Smith, a manager there.      CoinDesk’s New York office closed its doors on Tuesday, days after instituting an optional work-from-home policy. A reported COVID-19 case on a different floor of CoinDesk’s office building prompted the company to mandate remote work.      For now, the subtle shifts in work location are aimed at getting ahead of what is still a relatively miniscule coronavirus caseload in New York City. By allowing their employees the option to stay home these firms say they’re letting at-risk populations be that much safer.    Different approaches    Outside New York, companies and entities are taking different approaches. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission shuttered one floor of its Washington, D.C., headquarters and instituted optional work-from-home for the rest of the building after an employee presented some of the signs of COVID-19.      Likewise, San Francisco-based Coinbase began moving to remote work, following a contingency plan first shared by CEO Brian Armstrong last month.      “Effective Monday, 9 March, Coinbase will move to our tier 1 posture, including optional – but suggested – work from home for all employees globally,” the exchange said in its most recent public statement.      Google is asking all North American employees to work from home as well.      Martino, of now-decentralized Kadena, thinks coronavirus could have more far-reaching implications on the way Americans work.      “I really do feel that coronavirus is going to start to normalize a work-from-home orientation for American businesses,” Martino said.

That's the conclusion of a recent report by the Better Business Bureau (BBB), a nonprofit organization focused on marketplace trust.      The report found an average dollar loss in crypto-focused fraud of $3,000 for victims age 25 to 44. The relatively high figure was the result of nefarious actors taking advantage of those who lacked foundational knowledge of digital assets, BBB said.      Thirty-two percent of scams involved the exchange of cryptocurrencies for goods, services or fiat currency, while 23.4 percent involved the purchase of digital assets as purported investment opportunities, BBB found. Roughly one-third (31 percent) of cryptocurrency scams with a financial loss involved a company known as C2CX, apparently based in China.      It's worth noting that crypto crimes measured in the scam statistics include loss of funds resulting from hackers who infiltrated exchanges considered ""vulnerable."" BBB didn't provide data on how much of the risk rating arose from such hacks as opposed to fraudulent schemes.      The report looked at 10 different types of scam, with crypto ranking just above ""online purchase"" types of fraud, which came in third.      Cryptocurrency, however, fell behind employment scams to rank as the second most risky type with an index rating of 93.8, an internal measurement that takes into account a number of varying factors including susceptibility and exposure.      Exposure to crypto scams rose by just 0.4 percent year on year, one of the least, while employment scams rose by a much larger margin of around 9.3 percent. The latter type of fraud involves bad actors attempting to trick victims into sending money for a supposed ""guaranteed"" way to make quick bucks or gain a high-salaried job.

42404171,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUW7,1583931025,Bitcoin Price Is Now Up Just 9% This Year,"View  Bitcoin's short-term outlook remains bearish with prices trading well below key resistance at $8,460.  A move below Tuesday's low of $7,734 would likely encourage sellers, yielding deeper losses toward $7,100.  A move above $8,158 (Tuesday's high) would confirm temporary seller exhaustion signaled on the daily chart and allow a stronger bounce to $8,460.    Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent price drop has erased a major portion of its year-to-date gains.      The top cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $7,830 – up just 9.3 percent from the year's opening price of $7,160, according to CoinDesk’s Bitcoin Price Index.      Just a month ago, the cryptocurrency was reporting a year-to-date gain of over 45 percent. Back then, prices were trading at multi-month highs near $10,500.    Broad-based sell-off    Bitcoin’s recent price slide has occurred alongside a sell-off in the traditional finance markets.      The S&P 500, Wall Street’s equity index and a benchmark for global equities, topped out near $3,400 in mid-February and fell to a nine-month low of $2,739 on Tuesday. The index is currently down 10 percent on a year-to-date basis.      West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices nearly halved to $27 in the two weeks to March 9 and are currently down 45 percent from the yearly opening price.      The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note hit a record low of 0.35 percent on Monday and was last seen at 0.70 percent – down 122 basis points this year. However, gold, the classic safe haven asset, is up 10 percent since Jan. 1.      Though often touted as a safe haven, bitcoin looks to have behaved as a risk asset in line with traditional markets, as macro events prompted investor doubts.      ”A general sense of uncertainty seems to be the driving factor of investment decisions made by retail investors across different investment types, including bitcoin,“ said Ashish Singhal, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange CoinSwitch.      At press time, European equities are flashing green, possibly on the back of a surprise 50 basis point rate cut by the Bank of England.      Broader market sentiment, however, remains risk-averse with the futures on the S&P 500 down 2 percent, as the coronavirus spread is showing no signs of slowing down outside China. Meanwhile, oil prices on both sides of the Atlantic are down at least 1.5 percent.      The technical charts, too, suggest the path of least resistance is to the downside.    Daily chart    Bitcoin remains in bearish territory below the head-and-shoulders neckline resistance, currently at $8,460.      The cryptocurrency has produced a narrowing price range over the last two days, with Tuesday’s candle falling well within Monday’s high and low.      Such price action following a notable drop is indicative of seller exhaustion, but would be confirmed only if prices rise above Tuesday’s high of $8,158. That could bring additional gains toward $8,460.      Alternatively, a break below Tuesday’s low of $7,734 would imply a continuation of the sell-off and open the doors to support at $7,130 (200-week average).      A bullish reversal would be confirmed if and when prices rise above $9,219 (March 7 high), invalidating the lower-highs setup.    3-day chart    The MACD histogram is producing deeper bars below the zero line, a sign of strengthening bearish momentum. Meanwhile, prices are forming a bearish lower-highs, lower-lows (falling channel) setup.      As such, the odds of BTC falling toward $7,130 look high.      However, Alessandro Benigni, co-Founder at coinsflare.com, an exchange listing monitoring portal, thinks a new bullish trend will start soon, pushing prices to around $11,000 by the end of March/early April.      The possibility shouldn't be ruled out as bitcoin has historically performed well while heading into the reward halving, according to Nischal Shetty, founder and CEO of WazirX, told CoinDesk. The next miner reward cutting event is due in May.      “There are 61 days to go for the bitcoin halving. Looking at past data, bitcoin prices have seen an uptrend after halving [events]. Also, more countries are coming with positive regulations on crypto. I’m optimistic that these factors combined will have a positive impact on bitcoin's price,” Shetty said.

As reported by Jiji Press Wednesday, the men were held by the Metropolitan Police Department for allegedly obtaining NEM that were the suspected proceeds of crime – illegal under the law relating to punishment of organized crime. One of the two arrested – who are claimed to have known the tokens were stolen – is a doctor from Hokkaido and the other is a company exec from Osaka.      Coincheck suffered possibly the biggest-ever breach of a cryptocurrency exchange in January 2018, losing around $530 million worth of NEM. The hack was likely bigger even than that of Mt. Gox, which is thought to have lost $340 million in bitcoin over a period of time.      Tokyo police believe the arrested individuals have been exchanging the NEM for other crypto assets since February, Jiji said.  The arrests are the first relating to the Coincheck hack and come after Tokyo police formed a task force to investigate the theft.

42404170,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUU9,1583928000,New Celo Alliance Has Same Aims as Libra – And Some of the Same Partners,"The Silicon Valley crypto startup cLabs, focused on mobile payments and the Celo blockchain project, is following another precedent from Facebook’s Libra playbook by launching an industry association through a separate Celo Foundation.      Dozens of blockchain companies and investors – including Libra Association members Coinbase Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, Bison Trails and Anchorage – are committing to promote Celo tokens in some fashion by joining this “Alliance for Prosperity.”      “The Alliance will use blockchain technology to reimagine the future of money and create inclusive financial tools,” C Labs founder Rene Reinsberg said in a press statement. “From sending money home across borders to donating to a humanitarian organization, we want to make sure that money arrives in the right hands – not in the pockets of a middleman.”      Chuck Kimble, head of business development at cLabs and now also head of the Alliance for Prosperity, said the idea is for some members to hold Celo Gold tokens or become network validators. The recruitment approach seems to be increasingly commonplace in the industry, an acknowledgment that stablecoins need huge network effects to move the needle on financial inclusion.      “Members have committed to integrating with the Celo platform and enabling the outlined use cases,” Kimble said, referring to cross-border transactions using “accessible” financial tools.      “The Celo Foundation thinks of [decentralized finance] as ‘open finance’ and many of the Alliance members are exploring open finance DeFi use cases like trustless peer-to-peer lending,"" Kimble said, adding membership would be fluid as companies are expected to become “more deeply or less involved,” depending on the circumstances.      Even Facebook struggled to define what “official partners” meant when the Libra Association first started. Companies like Visa and Mastercard left the Libra Association within months. There is some precedent for such an alliance among crypto startups. For the smaller Patientory Association, funded by a 2017 token sale and also orchestrated by both a startup and nonprofit, members pay annual dues and participate in workshops related to regulatory standards and technical challenges.      “With the Alliance, we’ll see not just one mobile application for money transfers, but many applications for a variety of financial use cases,” said alliance member and Polychain Capital CEO Olaf Carlson-Wee. “To me, the Alliance proves that Celo is able to not only ship sophisticated, user-friendly products at global scale, but also empower member organizations to ship products on top of the Celo platform.”      From the perspective of members that joined both the Libra Association and the Celo clan, this new alliance may offer a way to hedge.      “We’re proud to work with a variety of organizations to create a more open and inclusive financial system,” said Anchorage President Diogo Monica.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TOKEN SALE,Leigh Cuen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/11/new-celo-alliance-has-same-aims-as-libra-and-some-of-the-same-partners,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dbab4ed163045691384995ba66bc111ef60875a5-1400x933.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Based in California, Paradigm Labs wanted to develop liquidity solutions for the DeFi space. It had a promising start in 2018 when it raised $1 million in an oversubscribed seed round led by Polychain Capital, with additional placements from Dragonfly Capital and Chapter One.      But in a blog post Tuesday, founder and CEO Liam Kovatch said: ""Our team has come to the decision that without significant product market fit and limited resources to pursue emergent opportunities, the kind of success we envisioned for Paradigm Labs is unlikely.""      Paradigm's failure to ""carve a viable niche in the DEX marketplace"" came as a result of a fast-evolving and fluid DeFi space that was difficult for the company to navigate, according to the post.      Its initial project, an order book that could be shared between different trading platforms, quickly became ""obsolete"" as Uniswap and P2P market infrastructure 0x Mesh grew in popularity, Kovatch said.      Although Paradigm had begun to make headway with a 0x-based non-custodial request-for-quotation system known as Zaidan, the company was ""constrained by the high-capital requirements,"" meaning it couldn't service trades or ""secure the necessary funding"" to keep it running.      ""The idea for Zaidan ... came to us late in the company’s life cycle at which point we were [too] under resourced to fully develop Zaidan. In general, we believe we were a bit too early,"" Kovatch said.      At the time of the seed round, Kovatch told CoinDesk the company had decided to cap investment at $1 million so the firm could remain ""capital efficient and lean.""      With Zaidan already shut down, Kovatch said Paradigm's 0x staking activities – known as Zaidan's War Chest – would be gradually wound up, along with the company, over the next month.",NEGATIVE,없음,MARKET | TRADING | UNI | ZRX,Paddy Baker,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/11/paradigm-labs-shuts-down-says-it-was-too-early-for-defi-boom,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/f86f6698edd72caad63e1908401d28d412664f82-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Both channels are back online at press time.

42404165,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUQD,1583921218,Figure Technologies Securitizes $150M of Home Equity Loans on Blockchain,"Figure Technologies has completed a long-awaited $150 million securitization of a bundle of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), billed as the first such transaction in which all aspects of the process were managed on a blockchain.      In other words, everything from the origination of the loans to the issuance of the bonds to the collection of borrowers' monthly payments is run on Provenance, Figure’s blockchain, according to the company. This distinguishes the transaction from most enterprise blockchain projects, which have either been demonstrations of the technology rather than live applications or touched just one piece of a complex process.      As such, the bond issue may serve as a showcase for the benefits of distributed ledger technology (DLT) to businesses at a time when such use cases no longer generate the same buzz as five years ago. Corporate experimentation with the technology now tends to take place under the radar, with the word “blockchain” spoken in hushed tones, if at all.      “While there are certainly other companies trying blockchain-based securitization, Figure's project is at minimum a notable and high-profile effort,” said Lewis Cohen, a principal at DLx Law, who was not involved in the transaction. “The future of securitization involves a level of detailed and accurate information about underlying assets that blockchain technology is well suited to provide.”      U.S. brokerage Jefferies Group and Japanese financial giant Nomura managed the bond sale for Figure. The two-year-old startup has raised over $225 million at a $1.2 billion valuation, including a $103 million Series C funding round in November. It has drawn a spate of serious backers in the blockchain space, including Morgan Creek, Digital Currency Group, Foxconn’s investing arm HCM Capital, Ribbit Capital and MUFG.    Blockchain's promise    As it stands, securitization – the decades-old Wall Street practice of repackaging loans into bonds sold to investors – can resemble a Rube Goldberg machine. One company may take the consumer’s application (the “originator”); another may fund the loan (the “warehouse lender”); yet another will sell the securities to investors (the “underwriter”); still another will mail the monthly bills and dun late payers (the “servicer”). That’s a simplified version.      By automating all these steps on Provenance, Figure says it can speed up the process and cut expenses.      “It costs us significantly less to originate loans on blockchain,” said Mike Cagney, Figure’s CEO.      For example, managing the information on one ledger can minimize errors, ensure those that do occur are caught and fixed sooner and eliminate fees for things such as transferring the loan between parties, according to Figure.      “We don’t have to pay for boarding costs, loan defects, while reducing quality control expenses,” said Cagney, the former CEO of online lender Social Finance.      Figure says it can approve a HELOC in five minutes and fund the loan in five days instead of the typical 30 to 60 days. The firm claims its technology could save $30 billion in costs for the $3 trillion annual securitization market if applied widely.      That’s still a big if.    A long haul    There is still skepticism about the potential benefits of blockchain adoption in the traditional financial services space, where centralized systems are seen as more efficient.      ""Blockchain is really a bad way to do almost anything,” said Chris Whalen, chairman of Whalen Global Advisors and a longtime Wall Street analyst and investment banker. “A simple XML ledger is far more efficient. Using blockchain in finance is like learning Urdu to enhance enterprise security.""      And by all accounts, getting Figure’s first deal done was difficult. It’s been in the works since at least May 2019, when the company announced it had obtained a warehouse line from WSFS Bank to fund the loans, with an eventual securitization as the endgame.      According to a Feb. 7 article in Asset-Backed Alert, a respected industry newsletter, the bond sale was originally scheduled for October 2019 but was held up due to a prospective rating agency’s concerns about the collateral, which included third liens. (Most HELOCs are second liens, meaning that in event of foreclosure, they wait in line to be repaid after the original mortgage lender; third liens, which are rarer and riskier, get whatever is left after that.)      Figure denied the report (the firm is suing the publication) and Cagney said the main cause for the delay was the fact that auditors are not familiar with on-chain practices.    DoubleLine buys in    Unlike most securitizations, Figure’s was not rated by an agency like Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s, nor was it registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). As an unrated private placement, the bonds would be more difficult to sell in the secondary market should the investors ever want to unload them.      However, Figure did successfully sell the bonds to third-party investors: Jeffrey Gundlach’s DoubleLine for the $127 million of senior notes and Tilden Park Capital Management for the riskier $22 million subordinated tranche, according to a white paper from Figure. Previously, European financial institutions Santander and Societe Generale have issued bonds on the public Ethereum blockchain, but only to themselves.      DoubleLine will be paid a 4 percent coupon on the senior bonds, which are expected to be paid down in three years. That’s more than three percentage points higher than the current yield on three-year U.S. Treasury bonds.      Cagney said the pricing on the senior bond was on par with comparable products and the firm did not have to compensate investors extra for the novelty of a blockchain, which he said adds value.      “There wasn't a premium we had to pay on the blockchain side,” he said.    Next steps    Provenance is different from the blockchains underpinning cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.      For one thing, it is “public permissioned,” meaning that while anyone can view the ledger, only authorized parties may write to it. No one needs permission to send a bitcoin transaction, and while mining on that network is an expensive undertaking, theoretically it’s open to all comers.      Further, there are 12 nodes validating transactions on the Provenance network, and Figure would identify only one of the operators, mutual fund giant Franklin Templeton. Thousands of nodes run on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks worldwide.      Figure developed Provenance in-house, using the consensus mechanism of Hyperledger, one of the three main open-source enterprise blockchain platforms (the others being R3’s Corda and private versions of Ethereum).      The firm aims to securitize another $200 million of HELOCs in the next four weeks and to issue its first student loan-backed bonds in the second quarter, according to Cagney.      And if Figure’s model catches on, it might ameliorate some of the problems that contributed to the global market meltdown of 2008.      “Securitization failed in the financial crisis because too many pools were originated without investors being able to efficiently understand what was in the pool and what they were lending against,” said Cohen, who made his name as a securitization lawyer and now specializes in blockchain work. “You could have detailed information without verification and you can have accurate information that may not be very granular.”      By contrast, “blockchain can give investors a better sense of what they are buying and how they are performing.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,"David Pan, Marc Hochstein",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/11/figure-technologies-securitizes-150m-of-home-equity-loans-on-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccce4247b1ea5b3f0cf0b219d26410118b29da01-800x534.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

I live in Beijing, where we have a saying: 币圈一天，人间一年 (“Bi Quan Yi Tian, Ren Jian Yi Nian”), which means a day in the life of someone in cryptocurrencies is a year for anyone else.      It is a recognition that, in blockchain, everything moves faster. The internet sublayer and the peer-to-peer nature of blockchain has accelerated time compared to other industries. In a little more than 11 years, the industry has emerged from grassroots adoption ignited by a white paper to 80 percent of central banks today developing or researching the creation of their own digital currency. Since 2016, an increasing number of nations have taken a top-down approach to accelerate blockchain and cryptocurrency innovation in their own markets with progressive policy to capture the opportunity.      See also: Hester Peirce: Tell Me How to Improve My Safe Harbor Proposal      In the U.S., we have seen a divergent approach from sophisticated financial regulators to tokens: some permissive and some restrictive. In February 2018, Christopher Giancarlo, the former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), advocated before the Senate a do no harm approach to regulating tokens, while the commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Jay Clayton, said every ICO I’ve seen is a security. Across the Pacific, in September 2018, Damien Pang, the head of technology for Singapore’s financial regulator, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), stated that none of the tokens the MAS has seen in Singapore are securities.    Current American Way    John Maynard Keynes once said: “The difficulty lies, not in the new ideas, but in the escaping from the old ones.”      In America, we have chosen a more restrictive regulatory track, unable to break free from old frameworks. Shortly after the February Senate hearings, significant resources were expended on enforcement actions related to token offerings, not only for fraud but also for a broad range of activities without allegations of fraud. These included registration violations and technical compliance errors within an uncertain framework, which many projects and lawyers misinterpreted. This period to present day has left our innovators, some of our brightest technical minds and inventive entrepreneurs, with a sense of trepidation. From the industry’s perspective, innovation in one of the most promising areas of technology has been stifled in the United States. This has resulted in U.S.-based projects becoming less globally competitive or stalled because of exorbitant legal compliance costs; as a result, some have chosen to leave the country or, even worse, others have simply given up.      Well-intentioned intellectual acrobatics to try to make tokens functional within the purview of U.S. securities laws, such as with SAFTs, SAFTEs, VFTAs and attempts to reconcile token projects with Regulation S-K (which lays out the detailed information required to be disclosed by issuers related to registering securities) have largely been unsuccessful because it is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.      Former commissioners of the CFTC and SEC have warned that digital tokens are “under threat of extinction through regulation in the United States.” As a 20-year securities attorney, I agree. Blockchain provides for the digital transfer of value, and tokens are the representation of this value. Given the importance of tokens to the development and application of blockchain technology, our industry desperately needs relief and guidance.      The Path forward    My firm was part of a delegation that brought Commissioner Hester Peirce to Singapore in July of 2019 for meetings with MAS, the SEC's foreign counterpart, and industry leaders from across the region. During her visit, Commissioner Peirce saw how a highly conservative jurisdiction with a well-formed and sophisticated financial industry, could safely regulate tokens and their offerings through permissive guidelines to promote a dynamic blockchain industry.      Singapore is seen as a leading hub of blockchain innovation because of a top-down approach with sensible regulation for tokens. The same could be said for similar jurisdictions including Switzerland and Japan. Switzerland, on a per capita basis, has five times the number of blockchain startups than the United States does, and attracts some of the best international (including U.S.) projects to domicile there. At the end of this trip, Commissioner Peirce publicly announced her support for a ""Safe Harbor"" for token offerings in the United States.      See also: Preston Byrne: Peirce’s Safe Harbor Proposal Would Be Hilarious if It Weren’t so Serious      Rule 195, proposed last month by Commissioner Peirce, is the next iteration of that Safe Harbor. This framework includes more detailed requirements for reliance and a new three-year grace period for start-up blockchain projects that are offering tokens with the purpose of being decentralized. It is intended to provide, in her words: “rules that well-intentioned people can follow….to enable them to pursue their efforts in confidence that they are doing so legally.”      Development teams need not only to distribute tokens, but also actively seek secondary market liquidity, which Peirce identifies in her proposal as “necessary both to get tokens into the hands of people that will use them and offer developers and people who provide services on the network a way to exchange their tokens for fiat or cryptocurrency.”      U.S. federal securities laws are a disclosure-based system, and Peirce reconciles that with the realities of projects issuing payment and utility tokens while balancing the need for material information to be publicly available for purchasers of the token that follows the general concepts of, yet is significantly different from, the requirements of Regulation S-K (which is more applicable to “hand on heart securities” such as equities).      Peirce and others at the SEC have clearly spent considerable time becoming deeply knowledgeable about the practicalities and needs of developing token-based distributed networks from inception to their ultimate functionality or decentralization, and reconciled how that can be tailored and dovetailed with the disclosure-based nature of the regulator’s framework.      The Safe Harbor requires disclosures about the project, initial team members and their token holdings and significant sales. It is thoughtful enough to also offer relief for the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as providing trading platforms the benefit of the Safe Harbor if they facilitate trading of the tokens.      The SEC’s antifraud provisions still apply to token offerings relying on Rule 195. This gives regulators an enforcement club to penalize fraudulent behavior including material omissions or misstatements in disclosures, or similarly deceptive conduct. This acts as a guardrail for the Safe Harbor, as does the requirement that, if a network is not sufficiently decentralized or functional within the three-year grace period, the token would require registration under the Securities Act of 1933 and begin periodic reporting under the Exchange Act of 1934 (10-Ks and 10-Qs). This is an extremely difficult burden for early stage companies to meet and should motivate them to make the best use of their grace period.    Where do we go from here?    The proposal is not perfect. It has some holes that Commissioner Peirce acknowledges need to be filled. For instance, we need to understand how development teams can be compelled further to keep disclosures up to date and timely, and provide information in a timely manner including sales by team members of 5 percent or greater of her/his tokens.      We may consider a quarterly or yearly attestation by a member of the development team to the regulated trading platforms that are also relying on the Safe Harbor to trade the token, and a delisting requirement in the absence of such attestation. The complexities and realities of how to actually administer the Safe Harbor, which relies on “good faith” within a securities law framework, is reflective of the lifeline Peirce is stretching to rescue our innovators as tokens sink into the quicksand of the restrictive and expensive securities law rubric.      Ideally, for innovation to thrive, we could lean towards regulation taken up by Japan, Switzerland and Singapore; such as proposed in the U.S. Token Taxonomy Act introduced by U.S. representatives Darren Soto (D-Fla.) and Warren Davidson (R-Ohio) seeks to exclude digital tokens from being defined as securities by amending U.S. federal securities laws (among other things). Yet, this is only one of the 27 different bills related to blockchain and cryptocurrencies currently logjammed in Congress, with regulation and the timeline required to get it passed (if it ever will be passed), an eternity for the blockchain industry.      Meanwhile, with respect to central bank digital currencies, China’s DC/EP (the digital yuan, which has been a six-year effort in the making) is the closest to launch. Disruption through blockchain innovation is coming and, under President Xi Jinping’s top-down directive in October 2019 to promote adoption of our industry, has been expedited.    As with most securities rules, the Safe Harbor will likely need multiple iterations to get it right.    China has since announced 10 municipal and provincial Fintech regulatory sandboxes, and now hails 33,000 blockchain projects within its borders. Even the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, which is comparable in market capitalization to the London Stock Exchange, launched its Blockchain Index of the largest 50 companies that have blockchain ventures listed on that exchange.      China, at both the state (i.e. federal) and local levels, is supporting its industry. Likewise Switzerland, Japan and Singapore. Commissioner Peirce should be given credit for seeking out new ideas and studying how other jurisdictions, with entrenched financial institutions and sophisticated financial regulations, have embraced innovation in digital assets while also protecting investors. Commissioner Peirce is now requesting comments on proposed Rule 195.      The SEC shares the ethos of blockchain: that of making code open source and accessible to the distributed contributions needed to help regulators be more efficient and think more practically about rule-making. Typically, draft rules from the SEC will remain open for 60 days for commentary from the public so the legal code can be developed in a manner that considers various permutations and combinations of improvements and vulnerabilities (i.e. how can we make the legal code practically functional and also avoid bad actors ‘gaming’ it).      See also: Crypto Industry Lauds Token Safe Harbor, but Warns of Risks      We are not at that stage yet. Commissioner Peirce on this occasion has proactively released the proposal before it is actually considered by the other Commissioners at the SEC as a future rule.      You can do your part to consider and comment on Commissioner Peirce’s proposal. As with most securities rules, the Safe Harbor will likely need multiple iterations to get it right. Whether relief comes in the form of a clear and permissive SEC ""No Action Letter"" or, even better, the Rule 195 Safe Harbor; or an act of Congress much further down the road, the process will still feel painfully slow for those running at blockchain speed (i.e. 币圈 Bi Quan) and uncomfortably fast for many others (i.e. 人间 Ren Jian).      As this bureaucratic process begins to unfold ahead of us, American innovators will be held back limping, leaving, or, most sadly, giving up. This dynamic might ultimately need a “Sputnik Moment” to catalyze a top-down permissive approach to be taken in the United States. Because, as Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee cautioned at the last Libra hearings: “The wave of innovation is spreading across the world, with or without us.”",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | REGULATION | TRADING | TOKEN SALE,Omer Ozden,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/11/the-us-needs-hester-peirces-safe-harbor-or-it-risks-falling-behind,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7e123ec1f3f4f4f0d3761c7d0b3ac0028d3513b2-2242x1820.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404157,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUKJ,1583917200,That Noise You're Hearing? Central Banks Struggling to Evolve,"Noelle Acheson is a veteran of company analysis and CoinDesk’s director of research. The opinions expressed in this article are the author’s own.      Back at the dawn of our evolution, one thing that helped us survive was our sensitivity to noise. If something startled us it was probably a threat and we had best deal with it, or at the very least pay close attention.      That’s still the case, and the noise in markets yesterday is a case in point.      Stock market crashes, oil price spillages and travel bans are indeed worth paying close attention to, even though there’s not much we can do to stop them.      Yet, noise is distracting. A misdirect, if you will. While we’re focusing on the sound of twigs snapping over here, something else is sneaking up on us from behind.      What I’m talking about is not necessarily sinister or even bad, and it has been going on for some time. It will, however, fundamentally change how our economies work, and it is very likely to have a significant impact on crypto assets.      I’m talking about the role of central banks.    Strong base    The first central banks emerged in Europe in the 17th century, in the form of Sweden’s Riksbank, which was intended to be a central lender and clearing house, and the Bank of England, founded as a joint stock company to purchase government debt. The U.S. Federal Reserve was created just over 100 years ago to manage the money supply and to act as a lender of last resort. (An interesting aside: The Fed, in its current structure, is a network of regional central banks, because the powers-that-be back then didn’t trust the idea of centralized finance. Go figure.)      The generally accepted role of central banks has in recent times been to manage a country’s currency and interest rates. Starting around the 1980s, it gradually expanded to cover capital flows, markets and the health of the banking system. And ever since Mario Draghi’s “whatever it takes” moment, in which he promised the European Central Bank would see the euro through its existential crisis back in 2012, central banks have been completely upfront about their changing role.      After central banks stepped into the void in the last crisis and did what they could to prop up flailing economies by lowering rates and “printing” money, we came to expect them to manage the economy.      It’s worth remembering that is not their original role. And that expectation is, in part, what has led us to the mess we are in today.    Tough choices    But what does this have to do with crypto assets, you ask? Bear with me a moment longer, we’re getting there.      First, let’s look at where central banks are today, in their role of “responsible parent.”      Since the general perception is that they pulled us out of the last crisis, we expect them to do the same again. But their most important tool last time was the ability to drastically lower interest rates. They can’t do that this time – rates are historically low, and in some regions even negative. Not much to drop there.      Perhaps they can stimulate demand by printing more money? That hasn’t worked well yet, in spite of trillions being pumped into the economy. It’s a stretch to think it will suddenly start to kick into gear now.      How about inflation, surely they can control that? That is, after all, one of their traditional roles. Yet, the unwinding of globalization, under way even before the coronavirus shut down supply chains, will also unwind the cost savings the freedom of movement of goods brought. With uncertainty leading to potential hoarding, and central banks trigger-happy with the consequence-free creation of new fiat funds, the stage is set for runaway inflation, difficult to control at the best of times.      And their coveted independence is likely to increasingly come under assault from politicians desperate for monetary stimulus, however ill-advised.      So, what will the central banks be able to do?    Big moves    If the central banks are unlikely to be effective going forward in managing capital markets, boosting demand or controlling inflation, what will we come to expect of them?      Regular readers of CoinDesk will know that central banks around the world have been exploring the concept of cryptocurrencies as a potential evolution of the current system. Some have even been experimenting, and Facebook’s announcement of its Libra project, which hopes to create a global digital currency, has accelerated plans almost everywhere.      I’m not saying that digital currencies issued by central banks are the answer to the global economy’s structural problems – I don’t think they are. And I am certain that any innovation, especially in finance, brings unexpected problems.      But if ever there was a time for central banks to make bold moves, it is now. By pushing forward with new ideas, they could establish a new kind of leadership. In times of extreme uncertainty, the understandable wall of resistance should be lower. And public sentiment is eager for any change that could bring hope of a new path of development.      With that, our perception of their role will shift again. They could go back to being managers of currency rather than stewards of the whole economy. The trust in the payments and settlement systems that broke in 2008 has not yet been repaired – now might be a good time to rebuild it. And by introducing a new type of currency, they could perhaps engineer a disentanglement of economic activity from capital markets, which could solve for some of the systemic vulnerabilities that have been building up over the decades.      These are seemingly impossible asks. They would require a reconfiguration of the complex wiring that binds markets, economics and politics. It could take decades, perhaps even a generation.      But the role of central banks needs to continue evolving. It’s not about saving face or making up for past mistakes. It’s about survival in a time of change.      We must sincerely hope central banks don’t become the “bad guys” in this unfolding drama. After all, we collectively let them take on more and more responsibility, and placed unreasonable expectations on their power. We have been in an “emperor has no clothes” moment for some time now – but over the coming months, more lights will be shined on our financial institutions and the nakedness will become hard to ignore. It’s time to find some new clothes.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Noelle Acheson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/11/that-noise-youre-hearing-central-banks-struggling-to-evolve,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/16f8f7a7f319cca6ce150c840822dce14c2a3847-2560x1703.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404162,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUOF,1583910000,UK Trade Negotiators Eye Blockchain Provisions in Coming US Trade Talks,"The United Kingdom's trade negotiators want to influence global blockchain regulation in its upcoming free trade talks with the United States, according to the negotiating objectives released by the U.K.’s Department for International Trade (DIT).      The plan is straightforward and the “opportunity,” as DIT called it, is clear. In its 184-page action plan released March 2, U.K.’s post-Brexit trade broker said it will “seek to deliver” favorable digital trade terms for small to midsize businesses, including those in blockchain.      “In areas such as data flows, blockchain, driverless cars and quantum technology we have the opportunity to help shape global rules through ambitious digital trade provisions,” the document states.      The document did not provide any actual details, and DIT declined to elaborate on its negotiating stance ahead of the talks. Such discussions have taken on heightened importance post-Brexit, especially given the U.K.’s already close trading ties with the U.S.      Peter Hunn, CEO of the smart contracts API firm Clause, said a deal could be beneficial for the blockchain space.      “There is a lot that can be done here to provide standardized interfaces using DLT systems and smart contract code that reduce administration, financial and compliance burdens,” he said.      DIT appears to have prioritized striking a strong digital trading partnership within its coming framework. An entire chapter of the negotiating objectives deal with “digital trade” including data protection, an open internet and cross-border data flows, among other issues.      The U.K. seeks to “future-proof the agreement in anticipation of rapid technological developments,” according to an accompanying press release.      There are some calls for closer cross-border crypto partnerships within the report. In an included appendix that summarizes the DIT’s trade agreement public comment period, held in summer 2018, some “business associations” are said to have lobbied DIT for closer fintech ties.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TRADING,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2020/03/11/uk-trade-negotiators-eye-blockchain-provisions-in-coming-us-trade-talks,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/692e8e0e0b4ab240b0c1fd2949a78e1f68c1fa2a-1419x916.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42404168,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhUTA,1583902800,How to Survive the Coronavirus and Keep Your Startup Alive,"Preston Byrne, a columnist for CoinDesk's Opinion section, is a partner in Anderson Kill's Technology, Media and Distributed Systems Group. He advises software, internet and fintech companies. His biweekly column, “Not Legal Advice,” is a roundup of pertinent legal topics in the crypto space. It is most definitely not legal advice.      This week, we take a slight detour from securities regulation and statutory interpretation into the nitty-gritty of running a company in the middle of a global crisis, something which – fundamentally – involves thorny legal problems.      What everyone needs to remember is the coronavirus outbreak is not the end of the world. It sucks but when it burns out – as it surely must – life will return to normal and all of the assets will be very, very cheap.      See also: The Markets Were Already Vulnerable, Then Came Coronavirus      This isn’t the world’s first recession and it won’t be the last. It’s not the world’s first pandemic and it won’t be the last. The key for entrepreneurs is to keep a cool head about you, don’t do anything stupid (if you have never used firearms, for example, now isn’t the time to acquire one and start carrying it while wearing a gas mask on city streets) and adopt a war footing while you steer your companies through choppy waters for 12 to 18 months.      While the crisis persists, your company will have obligations it is expected to perform. When the crisis recedes and the courts reopen, your company will need to provide an accounting of its obligations and answer for any it has fallen short on in the meantime.      Here’s how:    1. Protect your employees    In my opinion, the first job of early-stage founders isn’t to protect their investors, but their employees.      Cognizant that the formal legal duty of an officer of a company is to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members, early-stage firms usually fall into one of two buckets – founder-owned, or founder-and-VC-owned – and the identity of the shareholders changes a lot about where a company’s business priorities tend to lie.      In my experience, purely founder-owned companies tend to view their closest staff – who help the company make money – as assets, and regard VCs as a distraction.    VC investors are herd animals. Right now that herd is living out the conspiratorial prepper fantasy.    Founder-and-VC-owned companies, on the other hand, tend to regard their investors and investor relationships as a major asset of the company, at least until they manage to get the business moving under its own power. Investors’ interests tend to take precedence in such businesses.      There’s nothing wrong with either approach; sometimes the tech you’re building is so early stage that you have no choice but to accept investor funds if you want to spin up a business. However, keep in mind that (a) venture investment accepts a high degree of failure as inevitable and (b) failing to keep your employees safe from an epidemic may result in the sickness or death of the employee, possible onward transmission to third parties and adverse health consequences for you, your business and society at large.      Put another way, the venture investors can afford to lose a little money. Your employees can’t afford to get sick. Now, not next week, not tomorrow but today is the time to write and plan to implement policies around halting staff travel, staggered off-peak commuting, modified paid sick leave and disability cover, and working from home.      Communicate these policies to your employees. See e.g. Coinbase’s contingency plan as an example of best practice. These things may result in a slight reduction of productivity or less “face time” in the office, but they will save lives and they will protect your workforce, the people whom you will have to work with again, face to face, once the epidemic subsides.    2. Cut your burn rate. Now.    When the Saudis dropped the OPEC equivalent of a nuclear weapon on the markets, tanking the price of a barrel of Brent crude to $30, it became clear the coronavirus crash was going to have some wider consequences for the U.S. economy – chiefly, the bankruptcies of many middle-American shale oil firms.      These companies will be among the casualties of the coming recession. If you don’t want to be a statistic, you absolutely must plan for at least a year of highly adverse business conditions.      Don’t wait for things to turn around or hope the markets will turn; previous globe-spanning epidemics have taken 12 to 18 months to fully shake out and, absent a pharmacological intervention that renders the coronavirus epidemic an unpleasant but nonlethal illness, you should plan for the next year to be a very bumpy ride. Expensive office space, dead weight on the team – all of it needs to go, now. Don’t be afraid to make hard calls.    3. Whatever the deal is, close it. Now.    To quote Ryan Selkis, “The startup fundraising market just got absolutely f*cking walloped. Sequoia’s ‘Black Swan’ post will spook dealmakers, and lead to recut deals, startup layoffs, and distressed M&A.”      Following the above, if there’s a deal on the table – either an acquisition or a venture financing – on less than optimal but nonetheless acceptable terms, take it. Now is the time to go on offense in terms of closing any commercial transaction that will facilitate your business’ short-term survival or any return of capital for yourself or your investors.      See also: Bitcoiners in Europe Reflect on Economic Shocks as Coronavirus Spreads      The same applies to closing new customers. If you’ve only got 12 to 18 months of runway, start grinding on revenue – now.      VC investors are herd animals. Right now that herd is living out the conspiratorial prepper fantasy we in the tech crowd have entertained for years: hoarding freeze-dried food, buying crossbows (most VCs live in San Francisco or New York, so they can’t own firearms) and preparing to hole up in bunkers or Bay Area apartments for the long haul. Your startup is not at the top of their list.    4. Review your insurance.    If you’re looking to get insurance coverage for the coronavirus and related business interruptions, I have bad news – there probably isn’t a prospective fix here, and it’s possible a lot of markets that did cover this type of risk might go out of business.      This doesn’t mean you’re not covered at all or you shouldn’t put certain types of cover in place. If you’re a very-early-stage company, you’ll probably want to put basic coverage in place for e.g. general liability that some of your contracts and leases will require you to have.    If the coronavirus has interfered with the contract such that performing it has been rendered essentially impossible, there may also be common law remedies    If you already have insurance in place, review your policies. It’s possible to find coverage in surprising places – and the assistance of counsel can help you uncover it. If you manage to uncover a policy that happens to cover a coronavirus-related loss, before filing a claim make sure you reach out to counsel before you submit it to increase the likelihood of its success.    5. Review and restructure your contracts.    As part of your burn rate review, look at your supplier agreements, lease agreements and other agreements that are costing you a lot of money and which you might do better without. If there’s a force majeure clause that permits you to terminate the agreement, consider whether doing so might not be a bad idea.      If the coronavirus has interfered with the contract such that performing it has been rendered essentially impossible, there may also be common-law remedies like frustration or impossibility you can invoke. There may even be express early termination provisions that are directly on point. If you know what the terms of your contracts are, this will help you to know which ones you can jettison.      Even if you think you can’t jettison them, it might be worth approaching your counterparties to try to restructure the deal. You won’t get an abatement in your rent or released from a fixed-term agreement if you don’t ask for it. A mutually agreed negotiation ahead of time is nearly always preferable to acrimonious litigation after the fact.    6. Put in place a succession plan.    In the eyes of a virus, a CEO and an intern are exactly the same; indeed, if the CEO is older, the CEO is likely more vulnerable to the virus than more junior members of staff.      Don’t, like Quadriga, give one person the keys to the entire kingdom. Have disaster recovery plans in place and a key chain of command so that if one member of staff is taken ill or dies, the company can continue operating as a going concern. Back up your data in multiple geographic locales.      Stay safe out there.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | COMMODITY | MARKET | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Preston J.

42404142,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAdhSX8,1583895600,Blockforce Capital’s Crypto Fund Captures 86% of Bitcoin’s Upside in 2020,"In the first two months of 2020, Blockforce Capital’s multi-strategy master fund saw a 16.8 percent return compared to a 19.5 percent return in bitcoin (BTC), the company announced in a note to accredited investors.      Blockforce is a seasoned exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer that specializes in alternative investment vehicles for investors. In February of last year the company infamously filed the first proposal for an ETF made up of a mix of currencies including bitcoin, only to pull the fund at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s request the next day. Currently, the company only offers bitcoin-related funds to accredited investors.      Low volatility is the San Diego-based asset manager’s target for its multi-strategy fund, which hit its one-year anniversary this month.      With volatility of 24.5 percent compared to bitcoin’s 74 percent, Blockforce claims its fund has a third of the volatility of the cryptocurrency, capturing 86 percent of the upside of bitcoin and 12.5 percent of the downside.      The fund’s goal is to capture more than 80 percent of bitcoin’s returns with about 40 percent of bitcoin’s losses. It’s supposed to “give people something they can invest in without all the stomach acid of a direct cryptocurrency investment,” Blockforce CEO Eric Ervin said.      Forty percent of the fund is based on systematic strategies based on long-term and short-term trends in a mix of large-cap cryptocurrencies: bitcoin, bitcoin cash (BCH), litecoin (LTC), ether (ETH), XRP and Binance coin (BNB). (This 40 percent is heavily weighted toward bitcoin, Ervin said.) Twenty percent of the fund is based on a mix of these large-cap crypto assets in general, and the rest is based on stablecoin lending.      The upside performance of the fund has improved significantly since last year, the company noted. In the first four months of the fund’s operations in 2019, the fund only increased by 32 percent while bitcoin rose more than 180 percent. From July to December, the fund only dropped 16 percent while bitcoin fell by 33 percent.      “One thing to keep in mind when evaluating performance throughout 2019 was the erratic nature of returns,” Ervin said in the note, adding:      “In November, after a portfolio management team change, we significantly reduced the complexity of the models, we slowed down some of the signals and focused our research efforts on optimizing for trade frictions as well as identifying high-probability trends to confirm either up, down or sideways markets. These model updates went live in December and we have been very pleased with the results since that time.”      The company will continue to add updates to its “research in pain pattern recognition, predictive signals for correlation breakdowns and some other areas.”      Blockforce’s thesis, Ervin wrote, is the firm “will generate the bulk of [its] alpha through downside risk mitigation, portfolio overweights and underweights and the tactical use of digital asset lending in the portfolio.”",POSITIVE,BCH | LTC | BNB,BCH | EXCHANGE | LTC | RESEARCH | BNB,Nate DiCamillo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2020/03/11/blockforce-capitals-crypto-fund-captures-86-of-bitcoins-upside-in-2020,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/69f055ca7bca3195e6bcfd99967c7ba6c7e22de1-2560x1707.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
