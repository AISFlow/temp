CBOE filed a Form 19b-4 Monday, formally announcing its intention to list and trade shares of the VanEck Bitcoin Trust. The form kicks off the legal review period that could lead to the first bitcoin ETF in the U.S.  While CBOE filing a 19b-4 starts the formal regulatory review process, the SEC still has to acknowledge it is reviewing the application before the first 45-day clock begins. Within those 45 days, the SEC has to either approve or disapprove the application, or extend the review period.  The SEC can extend the review period up to 240 days before it has to make a final decision. Historically, the SEC has rejected every bitcoin ETF application, including previous efforts by VanEck.  Industry participants say a bitcoin ETF will allow retail traders to invest in a regulated bitcoin product without needing to invest in the cryptocurrency directly. Institutions may also be more willing to invest in a bitcoin ETF than in the cryptocurrency for compliance or reporting reasons.

The previous revenue record of $1.25 billion was set in December 2017 during the peak of the cryptocurrency's previous bull market. Last month's surge in revenue came as bitcoin's price climbed during the month from $33,000 to a new all-time high of just above $58,000 before dropping sharply to $43,000 in the last week.      Revenue estimates assume miners sell their BTC immediately.      Measured by per terahash per second (TH/s), miner revenues bounced between $0.23 and $0.38 through February, ending the month near $0.30, per data from Luxor Technologies.      Network fees brought in $186 million in February, or 13.7% of total revenue, a significant percentage increase from the 10.3% of revenue represented by fees last month. Fee revenue hit its highest mark since January 2018, per Coin Metrics data.

42386068,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR0sn,1614635429,"Mining Bitcoin for Heat, Strawberries and Chickens","There are strawberries growing in the village of Neuville, Quebec, in the middle of a Canadian winter. The small farm Le Caveau à Légumes is funneling the excess heat from crypto miners to battle the frost, and grow a rarity for the region.      “Now is really cold, so we need the heat,” Melissa Girard, an agronomist at the small producer, told CoinDesk in a phone interview. “We couldn't afford to produce strawberries if we had to pay for electricity.”      The farm is among a growing number of businesses and individuals turning to crypto mining for supplementary income, but approaching the highly consumptive industry in a carbon-neutral way.      Bitcoin is wasteful by design. The distributed network eliminates centralized and trusted parties by trading energy for consensus. Miners – essentially specialized graphics chips designed to churn through cryptographic math problems – audit the network and receive the occasional subsidy for that work.      Some see this as an inborn inefficiency, others as a necessary price to pay for an open and uncensorable payment network. No matter your view, however, it’s a fact that bitcoin mining expends a ton of power.      Cambridge University estimates the global bitcoin network consumes more energy than Ukraine did in 2019. This figure has certainly increased along with the cryptocurrency’s meteoric price rise, which draws in less-efficient miners that could now operate in profit. This is to say nothing of another bitcoin externality: heat.      Enterprising folks see that byproduct as crypto mining’s saving grace. For most of Bitcoin’s existence, it has not been economical for individuals to participate in the network by mining. But with a little know-how and some PVC pipe and duct tape, bitcoin mining can generate profit while helping to cut power bills.      Le Caveau began mining cryptocurrencies to generate heat for its greenhouses, and help offset the cost of electricity, in 2018. It was part of a pilot for the upstart hobbyist mining manufacturer Heatmine, also based in the region, which never got off the ground.      Founded by Jonathan Forte, Heatmine pitched itself as an ethical solution to crypto’s worrisome environmental footprint. The manufacturer wanted to offer a way for home and business owners to spin up a miner, earn passive income and recycle some of the heat generated in the process.      While the startup has folded (the website is offline, and Forte now says his partners ""never delivered"") the idea has taken hold even without dedicated heat-producing miners.      Kevin Carthy, founder of bitcoin ATM operator WinnipegBTC, has been reducing his carbon footprint while participating in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem by recycling heat into his office since 2013, he said in a direct message. He also uses it to keep his “little electric car warm in the winter,” he said.      Canada’s cheap energy and cold weather make it the ideal location to “mine for heat,” he said. While our conversation ran short, Carthy estimated his cost in 2018 to operate a bitcoin miner at $70 with revenue of $100 in crypto per month.      “We have cold weather, and we have inexpensive hydro,” Carthy told local news station CTV News. “You mine for heat and you still make a profit.”      Those figures line up with returns seen by other people experimenting with small-scale crypto mining. Christian Haschek, a computer scientist and tech blogger, recently started solo-mining ether (ETH) in his home in Austria.      “It has always been my lifelong wish to warm my home with the server heat,” Haschek said. After designing his own environmentally efficient house, which is primarily powered by solar energy, he started experimenting.      Haschek uses four crypto miners (that run at about 176°F) to preheat the air in his central ventilation system. “It's basically just a funnel,” he said. “It’s a pretty low-tech solution.” Even still, he said the incoming ETH covered half his electricity bill in January while also lowering the heat pump's electricity needs by about 50%.      “Mining is not very efficient,” he said. “I'm reusing the heat I'm self-producing, so it's almost a closed loop.”      Haschek estimates his mining operation would be profitable as long as ETH stays above about $900 (at the time of writing, it is above $1,500). Despite the allure of nearly free money, it’s only a solution for colder months, he says.      “It would definitely in the summer end up cooking my tomatoes on the vine,” Thomas Smith, a tech photographer and CEO of Gado Images, told CoinDesk. At the beginning of the pandemic, Smith began pumping heat from his crypto miners into a greenhouse in California.      Smith’s crypto mining adventures go back several years, when he decided to see if a rig could warm his home. The trial was a success, though he realized the variable nature of mining might be better suited to hobbyist pursuits.      Now in a new house, Smith is using the radiant heat to keep his chickens happy at night. “It’s a little bit easier because chicken coops have to be pretty well ventilated, so you're putting the heat into the coop, but it's circulating and being vented out.” (Chickens produce more eggs when coop temperatures reach 70 degrees F or so.)      He’s now thinking through how he might be able to automate when his rigs to turn on and off, adjusting to the temperature of his home, garden or coop. Not counting the value of his farm birds or caprese salad, Smith estimates he’s earned about $1,600 worth of cryptocurrencies.      It’s mostly just a hobby that helps pay for itself. But Smith, like Haschek, thinks it could provide a path forward for others looking to help secure cryptocurrency networks without adding to their climate guilt.      Of course, these efforts are small, and nowhere near significant to counterbalance the larger geopolitical forces at play in corporate crypto mining. But it’s a start.      And it couldn’t come at a better time. With bitcoin’s price going parabolic, alarm over the network’s consumption has never been sharper. Projects like Layer1 in Texas, which is making use of excess renewable energy production in West Texas as well as the numerous hydro-powered mining farms across the U.S., Canada and China are doing little to improve bitcoin’s image.      “Even if I scale this up as much as I could as one individual, it's not going to take me super far. But if a lot of people take these ideas and apply them at a larger scale, that could start to have a major impact on how much electricity and carbon emissions come out of these technologies,” Smith said.      Even neophytes such as Melissa Girard, from Le Caveau, who only lets the machines run while she tends to the plants, could see a future in crypto.      “It could be a nice way to heat houses,” she said.",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MINING | TRADING,Daniel Kuhn,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/01/mining-bitcoin-for-heat-strawberries-and-chickens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abe334e1e3711e88b07cd2d7b76f9da368b47932-2061x1374.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42386069,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR0u3,1614634389,Market Wrap: Bitcoin Faces Long Odds in Bid for Sixth Straight Monthly Gain,"Bitcoin rose 7%, reversing the past few days' losses, as some blockchain data turned bullish and new signs emerged of increasing cryptocurrency acceptancer by Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Fidelity Investments.    Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $48,593.99 as of 21:00 UTC (4 p.m. ET). Climbing 8.10% over the previous 24 hours.  Bitcoin’s 24-hour range: $44,874.92-$49,520.72 (CoinDesk 20)  BTC trades above its 10-hour and 50-hour averages on the hourly chart, a bullish signal for market technicians.    Bitcoin prices surged 36% in February, marking the cryptocurrency's fifth consecutive monthly price increase, the first time that's happened since mid-2019. A six-month stretch of gains hasn't been seen since the period of November 2012 through April 2013.      So the odds might seem stacked against a monthly gain in March, which would match the seven-year-old streak. But the first day of March pushed bitcoin in that direction amid signs that more big institutions are moving into cryptocurrencies.  A top executive for the giant U.S. money manager Fidelity Investments compared bitcoin with gold, and the investment bank Goldman Sachs said it will relaunch its crypto trading desk after a three-year hiatus. Citigroup, one of the biggest U.S. banks, wrote that bitcoin was at a “tipping point” as more institutions adopt the cryptocurrency.  Google Finance added a data tab on cryptocurrencies. And Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy, which has been a big bitcoin buyer for its corporate treasury, added another $15 million worth.      Read More: Fidelity’s Head of Global Macro Says Bitcoin May Have Place in Some Portfolios    Bullish blockchain data    The sudden move higher following last week's 21% plunge – the biggest market correction since March 2020 – was foretold by some traders and analysts who were seeing increasingly bullish signs in blockchain data.      One such indicator, the spent output profit ratio (SOPR), represents the profit ratio of coins moved on the blockchain. If the metric is above 1, that means most holders could sell their bitcoin at a profit. But when it slips below 1, more traders would be selling at a loss, seen as unsustainable since many holders are reluctant to accept anything but profits.      And the metric dropped below 1 on Saturday for the first time since last September, according to data from Glassnode. The implication is that investors would refuse to sell until prices rose.      Read more: Why $1 Million Bitcoin Is Coming      “The SOPR metric has been reliable for ‘buy the dip’ opportunities in bull markets,” Norwegian blockchain firm Arcane Research wrote in a tweet on Monday.      “In a bull market, investors are more inclined to take profit until the stop-profit point and refuse any stop-loss orders,” crypto analytics account BeatleNews on Chinese-language based social media platform Weibo, wrote in a post Sunday night, “When SOPR is below 1, the available coins for sale will decrease and it becomes easier for prices to rebound.”    Key support levels    On the price chart, as bitcoin dropped near $43,000 on Sunday, it was just above a key supporting price range of $40,000-$42,000, as mapped out by Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital in its Telegram channel on Feb 22. (See chart above.)      The price range represents ""the hedge fund trading level corresponding to the parabolic trendline,” QCP Capital wrote. “This has to hold to preserve the strong bullish momentum, and is now the bull and bear line in the sand.”    Derivative market resets as funding rates drop    Bitcoin’s futures markets continued to cool down over the past weekend, a sign traders were reducing risk and deleveraging, and possibly resetting for a fresh bull run. The perpetual futures funding rate – the average cost of holding long positions on major exchanges – declined to 0.006% per eight-hour period Saturday, from 0.125% on Wednesday, according to Glassnode.      The perpetual futures funding rate in the past three months, as shown on Glassnode’s chart, rose during each price surge and followed with a correction after it climbed to a new peak.    Stock rebound might bode well for bitcoin    A ​recovery in U.S. stocks on Monday may also signal a renewed appetite among investors for risky assets, which would include bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's sell-off last week came as a rise U.S. Treasury bond yields prompted concerns the Federal Reserve might soon tighten monetary policy. Bitcoin has benefited over the past year from unusually loose monetary policy.      The yield on 10-year Treasury notes, the benchmark borrowing cost in global debt markets, dropped to 1.43% on Monday, which has eased some investors’ nerves on potential tightened monetary policies.      Read more: Investing in Cryptocurrencies Is ‘Not Prudent,’ Says New York Attorney General      As crypto trading data firm Skew wrote in a tweet last Friday, the correlation between stocks and bitcoin rose last week because both markets lost altitude as bond yields climbed.      ""Let's see how this evolves,"" Bendik Norheim Schei, head of research at Arcane Research, told CoinDesk. ""A break above $52,000 would be encouraging but I would not be surprised if we get some more ranging. It's been a good start of the week in traditional markets and if last week's uncertainty is over, I expect bitcoin to continue up as well.""    Ether joins bitcoin in price recovery    Ether (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was up Monday, trading around $1,520.44 and climbing 7.26% in 24 hours as of 21:00 UTC (4:00 p.m. ET).      Ether continued to move in tandem with bitcoin, yet a key market indicator has shown some potential risks of ether’s price movement going forward.      According to Skew, Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) premium flipped negative last week, meaning the trust was trading at a discount to the spot price, the first time ETHE ever closed in negative territory.      “Our worry is the many players using Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and ETHE as part of their cash-and-carry strategy and whether a sustained discount there will have severe knock-on effects across the curve,” QCP Capital wrote in its Telegram channel on Sunday. “This is our risk going into March.”      Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, CoinDesk’s parent company.

42386056,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR0gD,1614631492,Wasabi Wallet and Bull Bitcoin Donate $40K in Crypto to Bitcoin Knots Development,"Monday, Bitcoin privacy wallet Wasabi Wallet and Canadian exchange Bull Bitcoin announced they’re donating 0.86 BTC (about USD $41,370) to the development of Bitcoin Knots, a bitcoin full node and wallet software developed by Luke Dashjr.      In a blog announcing the donation, Wasabi Wallet said the donation, split equally between the two companies, was needed given the lack of financial support and incentive for developing and pursuing open-source tech.      The goal is to generally support the development of Bitcoin Knots and does not have any specific stipulations, according to J. Daniel Beluska of ZkSNACKS, the private company that supports the development of the open-source Wasabi Wallet.    What is Bitcoin Knots?    Bitcoin Knots is another software implementation of Bitcoin. While Bitcoin Core is the primary implementation and what the majority of nodes run, Knots is one of a few alternative implementations. About 426 or so nodes run these alternative implementations.      “For the average user, this means that the Bitcoin network is more diverse and robust given there isn't a single point of failure,” said Beluska in an email, referring to Bitcoin Core as one such single point. Instead, there are “multiple client implementations maintained by different developers.”    If the companies that profit from Bitcoin open-source development don’t provide the necessary funding, who will?    “Bitcoin Knots is a Bitcoin node and wallet software project which is used as an alternative to the more popular Bitcoin Core software,” said Bull Bitcoin CEO Francis Pouliot in a message. “There are additional features in Bitcoin Knots that are not included in Bitcoin Core, some of which make transaction verification processes easier and more efficient in some contexts.”      Bull Bitcoin is a Canadian bitcoin exchange designed to let users retain full control of their private keys when they buy, sell or spend bitcoin on the platform using their own bitcoin wallet.      Pouliot said all Bitcoin transactions received by either Bull Bitcoin or Bylls are verified using Bitcoin Knots (indirectly via Wasabi Wallet) in addition to the verifications independently performed by Cyphernode’s Bitcoin Core integration.    Read more: Wasabi Wallet 2.0 Will Offer Automatic CoinJoins by Default to Boost Privacy    Bitcoin Knots is used as a dependency by other Bitcoin wallets, such as Wasabi Wallet, that wish to benefit from these features.      “This is important because Wasabi Wallet is the overall best and most effective tool for users to protect their privacy while using the Bitcoin network,” Pouliot said.    Supporting open-source development    “Cypherpunks write code, but cypherpunks don’t always get paid. We can’t expect the world’s most talented experts to contribute indefinitely without financial compensation,” said Pouliot of the joint donation. “If the companies that profit from Bitcoin open-source development don’t provide the necessary funding, who will?”      The move follows other donations made by zkSNACKS, which donated 1 bitcoin to the Human Rights Foundation’s Bitcoin Development Fund.      “We hope that this will help Luke Dashjr work on the Bitcoin Knots software project, but we trust his judgment to allocate his time to whatever project he sees fit,” said Pouliot. “This grant is not only meant to help Luke Dashjr continue his contributions to Bitcoin Knots, but also in recognition of his past contributions to Bitcoin more broadly.”    Read more: Bitcoin Taproot Upgrade Nailed Down for July, but Some Finer Details Still Aren’t Finalized    In the debate around Taproot activation BIP8 LOT=True or LOT=False, Luke Dashjr advocates that upgrades should be the domain of node operators, not miners. LOT=True would ensure that node users signal for Taproot-supported blocks only and, therefore, reject blocks from miners who haven't adopted Taproot. Because of this, zkSNACKS makes clear in its blog post that its donation is unrelated to Taproot activation via BIP8 LOT=True.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Benjamin Powers,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/01/wasabi-wallet-and-bull-bitcoin-donate-40k-in-crypto-to-bitcoin-knots-development,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b5397239158f3b73b83c43c03df1878943b80e03-2121x1414.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42386062,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBR0mV,1614626660,"NFTs Aren't Art? OK, Boomer","But is it art?      It's the same overwrought quandary that pops up every time technology invents a new kind of paintbrush. And with digital art and collectibles, that's what the blockchain and other decentralized technologies are: another paintbrush.      Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are artworks made with the blockchain and smart contracts as key tools.      Axios columnist Felix Salmon doesn't get NFTs.    This article is excerpted from The Node (formerly known as Blockchain Bites), CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.    In his Feb. 25 newsletter Salmon traces the idea of digital ownership back to the blockchain startup Monegraph (whose launch your correspondent covered for another news site). Salmon claims (probably correctly, who knows?) that the sky-high prices for the best stuff right now reflect, in his words, ""Excess wealth and liquidity, especially in a world where a lot of people are experiencing windfall cryptocurrency profits.""      Maybe! It's good to remind people to be cautious in any speculative market.      But then he writes:      ""If you look at Hashmasks or CryptoPunks or much of the rest of the NFT world, there's no connoisseurship at play – no correlation between artistic merit and financial value.""    Objection, your honor    If Salmon wanted to choose cases in point for artistically meretricious works, it's hard to imagine worse choices than CryptoPunks and Hashmasks.      I suspect Larva Labs did not describe CryptoPunks as a work of ""art"" when the team created it in June 2017, but I will. Breaker Magazine (RIP) did, too.      To assess merit, it's important to consider a work's context. Artwork doesn't exist outside of history or outside of space; the quality and depth of the statement it makes is relevant to its time and place.      Created before a standard was in place for such tokens, Cryptopunks existed entirely online. It made a statement about the potential of the Ethereum blockchain simply by existing as intended.      Further context: CryptoPunks were minted during the initial initial coin offering craze with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing from avaricious retail investors to startups that often had little or no plan. So it's hard not to read a critique of that frenzy into Larva Labs’ decision to issue CryptoPunks for free to any Ethereum user who claimed them.      But those are deeper aesthetic points. Most people understand aesthetics in terms of appearance. So, fine: Choosing to go with ""punks"" as the theme spoke specifically to Ethereum's more countercultural, hipster vibes, particularly then.      Further, the pixelated, 8-bit graphics spoke playfully to a digitally native form. All very on point and artfully capturing that moment.    Next level    Then there’s Hashmasks.      I happened to catch Hashmasks early, when you could still get one for 0.3 ETH (about $500 at current exchange rates). They’re now selling for six-figure dollar sums. I debated banging out a story late on a Friday night because as soon as I saw them I thought: Oh dang, these are going to be big.      Hashmasks were picking up on similar themes as CryptoPunks but, a few years later, deftly extending the narrative.      The project combined work by flesh-and-blood artists with procedurally generated computer graphics, making software just as much an artistic tool as a cartoonist’s pen and ink.      Further, Hashmasks used liquidity mining, an innovation of the budding decentralized finance (DeFi) market, to enable token holders to participate in the works by renaming them, a collaboration that will run for at least a decade.      The graphics themselves evoke Basquiat-esque vibes and the vernacular of graffiti. The mood could be read as either speaking to how much more diverse the crypto community has become or a hope for it to be yet more inclusive.      Either way, as statements go, not bad.    Eye of the NFT holder    And beyond all that? They were just. So. Cool.      I get it, not to everyone's tastes but look: Your grandpa probably didn't like rock and your dad probably didn't like hip-hop. Were either on the right side of history?      Dismissing these works out of hand reads roughly the same.

42387597,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qQlnex,1614621173,Cardano's ADA Token Tripled in February to Outperform CoinDesk 20,"Cardano, a smart-contract blockchain aiming to rival market leader Ethereum, tripled in February to dominate performance rankings among the CoinDesk 20 digital assets.  The gains came during a bullish month across the board for cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin (BTC), the largest, posting a 36% return. Ether (ETH), the second-biggest and the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, climbed 7.4% on the month.  But it was Cardano and other Ethereum alternatives that topped the rankings. Aside from the 274% gain for Cardano’s ADA token, the ATOM token from Cosmos rose 122%, based on CoinDesk pricing.  Cardano’s gains were so impressive that its market capitalization climbed to about $40 billion, becoming the third-most-valuable digital asset and vaulting past cryptocurrencies like bitcoin cash (BCH) and litecoin (LTC) that had led the industry standings in recent years. XRP, the token used in Ripple Labs' payment network, fell 15% on the month.  ADA climbed to a new all-time high of $1.49 on Feb. 27, topping the peak price of $1.30 reached in early 2018 at the tail end of the last bull market for cryptocurrencies.  The ebullience in the market for ADA might eventually contend with some of the network’s realities. While touted as an “Ethereum competitor,” Cardano doesn’t as yet have any smart-contract functionality. Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the developer team behind the blockchain, has taken a long-term approach to developing the network. For example, Cardano only recently transitioned out of the hands of IOHK and into the community’s control with July’s “Shelley” hard fork.  The ""Mary"" hard fork scheduled for today will allow users to create new tokens that run on Cardano natively, just as ADA does.  Goguen is the next hard fork on the docket for IOHK CEO and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson. That upgrade should occur in the first half of 2021 and should introduce smart contracts, the team claims.  That being said, it’s likely that unit bias – when investors buy a cheaper alternative asset given its lower price against more established ones – is coming into play for the cryptocurrency given its low price per unit compared to other cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, ether or even Polkadot’s DOT.

42433756,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4wvh,1614621114,DeFi Money Market Compound Embraces Multi-Chain Future With 'Gateway' Testnet,"The Gateway testnet – the next home for decentralized finance (DeFi) money market Compound – is now live.      The Substrate-based blockchain is fully embracing interoperability, where application developers build on every base layer and not just Ethereum, Compound Finance founder Robert Leshner said in a phone interview.      “Gateway is really designed for a multi-chain future where assets live on multiple blockchains and where decentralized finance applications and logic runs on multiple blockchains as well,” Leshner said.      The project was first laid out in a December 2020 white paper under the name Compound Chain with specific reference to catering to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). It's currently available via Ethereum’s Ropsten testnet.    Read more: Compound’s New Blockchain Readies DeFi for Central Bank Digital Currencies    “Ethereum might be the core of where most applications and assets live, but there are going to be popular DeFi applications on other chains and there are going to be popular assets issued on other chains. Gateway is designed to connect Ethereum between different blockchains so users can move value between them more easily,” he added.      Leshner said Gateway will be able to port assets from one blockchain to another using Gateway specific bridges called “starports.” An Ethereum starport is now active on testnet, he said, with the community responsible for adding further bridges. He expects the testnet to run for two months before fully launching.      As on off-shoot of Compound, Gateway will be governed by the same COMP token first released in June 2020. The same rights and responsibilities associated with the token accrue to owners on Gateway, such as the ability to add new assets. Yet, as Substrate-based blockchain, Gateway will have increased functionality given its highly modular design, Leshner said.      “When there's a new version of the blockchain, there is not a hard fork,” Leshner said of Gateway’s flexibility. “You can update the chain in real time … whenever that code is ready.”    Big picture    Through Gateway, Compound Finance could become the keystone to an envisioned “multi-chain future” where Ethereum quite simply isn’t enough to handle a new financial system. Ethereum-compatible chains like NEAR, Polkdaot, Solana and now Gateway are bets on this hypothesis coming true.      Gateway, Leshner said, “is designed to be a cross-chain tool and not a scaling tool.” The new chain will someday provide a bridge for assets without demanding token wrapping or other piecemeal shortcuts for getting blockchains to talk to each other.      Layer 2 solutions like rollups are important, Leshner said, but miss the point on what a multi-chain future is trying to accomplish. Having different chains means different rule sets can talk with each other and exchange value. With rollups, you still operate under Ethereum’s governance structure.      “We love all these scaling solutions for Ethereum. All of those are going to make Ethereum cheaper and more usable and that's a good thing,” he said. “We’ve looked at all those solutions but they don't really achieve what we want to do",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | FORKS,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2021/03/01/defi-money-market-compound-embraces-multi-chain-future-with-gateway-testnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/af415d005762eb14d782cf868f1c1c198b9e8523-1500x869.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433776,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4xJh,1614619870,"Bitcoin Artist Concludes 12-City Billboard Exhibit With $10,000 Bitcoin Treasure Hunt","Off a busy highway in a blue-collar neighborhood just outside San Francisco, a billboard emblazoned with a giant $1 bill overlooks the city’s cracked asphalt. But as you notice from the hooded George Washington on the bill, the billboard houses no ordinary dollar. In fact, this altered dollar is the start of a $10,000 treasure hunt.      The billboard is one of a series of 12 and is the latest artwork from pseudonymous Bitcoin artist Cryptograffiti.      Part visual, part performance art, the exhibition takes place in each of the 12 Federal Reserve branch cities: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Kansas City, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond, San Francisco and St. Louis. Every billboard, a variation of Cryptograffiti’s “United Nodes of Bitcoin” piece, bears its own unique statement.      Each epigraph is an aphorism, shibboleth or call to action that will be familiar to most bitcoiners. The artist told CoinDesk the work is meant to draw attention to bitcoin in areas where he believes it’s needed most: low-income neighborhoods.      Hosting it in Federal Reserve branch cities is part of the message. And given bitcoin’s current bull market, he wants to make sure this message is conveyed before bitcoin's price runs aways from his target audience.      “We’re seeing the price go up a bunch and I don’t want to see the everyday citizen get left behind. We need to teach as many people as possible about what this is about,” Cryptograffiti told CoinDesk..      “Try and do something that brings attention to it by making a statement with magnitude in the Fed’s backyards and redirect the viewers back to bitcoin and educate them that they may be held back by the Fed’s policies. It’s more than just the billboard.”      And behind this “more” – the message of the artwork – is something more still: a 0.21 BTC prize.    Bitcoin treasure hunt    The last billboard’s opening kicked off the treasure hunt.      Cryptograffiti scrawled the first clue to a private key for 0.21 BTC on the billboard, and he’s been posting clues under the tweet thread to the rest of the private key every day since. He told CoinDesk he thinks the key will finally be swept sometime this week (there’s already an active Discord server on the case).      The part-puzzle, part-artwork is part and parcel for Cryptograffiti, a pseudonymous bitcoin artist whose projects typically infuse bitcoin’s cryptographic themes and symbolism with charity and activism.      His past artworks include a live charity auction for Venezuelan orphans whereby bids triggered the physical dismantling of a Nicolas Maduro portrait made of bolivars, and a tiny black swan piece made of U.S. dollars that sold for less than a penny using the Lightning Network.    Read more: This Artist Explores the Art and Politics of Crypto Culture    For his largest project yet, he chose his United Nodes of Bitcoin dollar art for this because of the effect the same artwork had in 2016 at an art exhibit in the Digital Garage co-working space in San Francisco, he told CoinDesk.      “Everyone would just gravitate toward the dollar. It’s a familiarity thing and people like money and want money. So I would use it to teach them about bitcoin,” he said, adding that bitcoin keywords like “nodes” and “public address” on the art are good educational jumping-off points.      Cryptograffiti recently finished the artwork for the backside of the piece in anticipation of the 12-city exhibit. Prints for this artwork completely financed the rent space for the billboards, which ranges in price from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a month, depending on the city.    A ‘Trojan horse’ for bitcoin    By couching the bitcoin message in something so familiar and desirable, he said, the art is something of a Trojan horse for inspiring interest in bitcoin to the uninitiated.      “It tends to be a curious introduction. The reactions very much mirror the people who saw the original in 2016 in Digital Garage. Very Uncle Ned saying, ‘What is THIS all about?’      “I wanted to take what I learned about inflation and the wealth gap and try to put it in a project that would grab attention, not just in real life but online too.”      An augmented-reality portion of the artwork brings these inflationary themes to life. Co-developed with fellow crypto artist Josie Bellini, this AR component presents the billboard’s dollar bill as a graph that illustrates the erosion of the dollar’s purchasing power over time.    More bitcoin art, less bitcoin jargon    This animation is the billboard’s most dynamic feature, and it lays out the art’s message clearly.      Cryptograffiti told CoinDesk that, as much as the dollar is a Trojan horse for bitcoin, so bitcoin art exhibitions are something like a symposium. The art may make bitcoin more palatable to outsiders, who otherwise would find nothing emotionally resonant to connect to the otherwise-perceived cold, technical world of bitcoin.      “Since it’s artistic, it makes people more open to asking questions. They can have more real conversations than if it’s a more jargon focused approach,” Crypografitti said. As such, he believes that artists and the like are “a sign of health for the community.”      As bitcoin and other coins have seen increased valuations over the past year, crypto-related art has been selling red-hot alongside them. Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens are posting auction prices north of $1 million and bitcoin artists have been using new platforms like Scarce.city to auction their art for bitcoin.      Cryptograffiti’s art puzzle draws on a long tradition of bitcoin giveaways embedded in art as a way to drum up enthusiasm for the now trillion dollar asset. It’s easier to draw eyeballs these days, Cryptograffiti said, and his latest work has already raised questions about if he’d extend it to other parts of the country, like rural America.      The artist didn't want to reveal too many additional details, but he did say that there’s enough momentum behind the project at this point that it’s “a possibility.”      “This could turn into something bigger.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | FIAT | TRADING | AR | AIRDROP,"Colin Harper, Blockspace Media",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2021/03/01/bitcoin-artist-concludes-12-city-billboard-exhibit-with-10000-bitcoin-treasure-hunt,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/771b07dab731cf29f8303c5d285d2f721572d3fe-1200x675.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433779,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4xPh,1614615408,"Bitcoin Heads Back Toward $50K, Rebounding From Disastrous Week","Bitcoin (BTC) started the month on a positive note, jumping more than 8% to about $49,000 after a price plunge last week that was the biggest since the coronavirus wrecked markets early last year.      The gains came amid fresh signs of adoption of digital-asset technologies. Citigroup, one of the biggest U.S. banks, wrote that bitcoin was at a ""tipping point"" as more institutions adopt the cryptocurrency. Google Finance added a data tab on cryptocurrencies. And Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy, which has been a big bitcoin buyer via its corporate treasury, added another 328 BTC (worth $15 million), bringing the company's hoard to 90,859.      The cryptocurrency's price fell 21% in the seven days through Sunday, the biggest weekly drop since March 2020. Investors fretted that rising U.S. government-bond yields might signal heightened prospects for inflation, which could theoretically lead to an early unwinding of monetary stimulus by the Federal Reserve. Central bank stimulus has fueled concerns of inflation over the past year, and many big investors say that bitcoin might serve as a hedge against rising consumer prices.      The top cryptocurrency still managed to gain 36% in February, the fifth straight monthly gain. That's the longest such winning streak since June 2019, according to CoinDesk 20 data.      The February gain could have been much higher had the cryptocurrency stayed resilient to last week's instability in traditional markets.      Bitcoin fell from record highs above $58,000 to as low as $43,000 in the seven days to Feb. 28, as the U.S. 10-year yield jumped to 12-month highs, above 1.6%, sending stock markets lower.      More important, the Fed funds futures – financial contracts that represent the market opinion of where the daily official federal funds rate will be at various expiries – brought forward the timing of the first interest rate hike to the end of 2022 from 2024, diluting the appeal of so-called store-of-value assets such as bitcoin and gold.      According to Citi analysts, markets are now pricing in an 80% chance of a Fed 25 basis point rate hike to 0.25% by December 2022. Meanwhile, as per the French bank Societé Generale, markets are now foreseeing interest rates at 2% in five years, while most Fed members expect rates to be unchanged from current levels at the end of 2023, according to projections released in January.      Even so, bitcoin has bounced to $48,400 today, representing a 7% gain on the day. Some analysts say the cryptocurrency's pullback may not be over yet.      ""We think there's still room for more weakness ahead and would caution against expectations that the bottom is in,"" Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Digital, told CoinDesk. ""At the moment, the biggest risk to bitcoin is the short-term risk associated with a downturn in U.S. and global equities.""      Trader and analyst Alex Kruger said the cryptocurrency's pullback has ended for now, and prices could rise this week; however, a fresh drop can be seen later if the Fed fails to keep yields under control.

Provided to CoinDesk on Monday, Coinfirm's report said, of the $10.5 billion total, over two-thirds (67.8%) was misappropriated by fraud and scams.  That's seven times more than hacks, which reaped 9.6% of the 2020 total of ill-gotten gains.  Darknet markets and the drugs trade made up 18.4%, while sanctions breaches accounted for just 3.9% of the yearly total.  However, the firm notes that the crypto total still pales in comparison to EY's estimate that crime in traditional finance amounted to $1.4-3.5 trillion last year.  The data showed most notably that scams saw a sharp rise for 2020, in part due to the PlusToken scam which fleeced investors for around $2.9 billion.  However, fund misappropriated by frauds and scams have doubled since 2017, per the report.  The company further noted that much crypto crime is hidden, with 80% of fraud and hack cases not reported in the year they occur and up to 50% not reported at all.  It arrived at the data having developed a ""map"" of global crypto crime through its own methodologies and services.

42433769,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4xBh,1614611461,Why Money Scarcity Means Someone Goes Hungry,"Money is both a store of value and a medium of exchange. People want to hold it as part of their wealth and they also need to spend it on food, water, shelter, clothing and things that make life worth living. Unless money supply grows sufficiently to accommodate both the desire to save and the need to spend, saving in the form of money necessarily impoverishes other people.      Why is this? Well, let’s imagine for a minute that the only purpose of money is exchange. People use money to buy the basic goods and services that they need to live, but they don’t buy non-essential items and they don’t save. It should be obvious that if money is evenly distributed across the population, the amount of money in circulation must increase at the rate at which the population grows. If it doesn’t, then someone goes hungry.    Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People's Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.    Now imagine that people start saving some of their money instead of spending it all. Physically saving money – stuffing your mattress with it, for example – removes it from circulation. It can’t be used to buy food or pay the rent. So if everyone is stuffing their mattresses, more money must be created, otherwise the money in circulation becomes insufficient for everyone to buy what they need, and someone goes hungry.      Why might people stuff mattresses? One reason is insurance. If I have a mattress full of money, then if I need funds in a hurry I can simply raid my mattress. I don’t have to wait for the bank to open and I don’t have to worry about whether it will have enough money to pay me. And I don’t have to try to raise money by selling or pawning the family silver.      For people who lived through the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, the fear of not being able to access money or, worse, losing their savings in failing banks and crashing markets, is intense. Not that many of today’s savers stuff mattresses. But they do demand that their savings are safe.      See also: Michael Casey - COVID Economy Shows Monetary Failure      In the past, they relied for safety on institutions: deposit insurance on bank accounts, government bonds in pension portfolios. But now they can hold cryptographically secure digital assets that are as liquid as cash: Coins that no one can take and that are available to spend whenever they need them. The rational desire for safe and liquid savings is a major driver of the cryptocurrency revolution.      If stashing money away against a rainy day was all that people wanted to do, then money would not need to gain in value. It could even erode in value if interest rates on savings were high enough to compensate for the inflation loss. But people want more than just rainy day savings. They want to build wealth. And they want that wealth to grow all by itself, whether or not they add to it from their earned incomes. When they hold their wealth in the form of money, that creates a problem.      There is a fundamental tension between those who primarily want to save money and those who primarily need to spend it. Those who want to save money don’t want the supply to increase, because they like their money to appreciate in value, and producing more of it stops it appreciating. But those who need to spend money prefer the supply to increase, because it makes money easier to obtain. Admittedly, if money rises in value then they can buy more with it, but that’s no consolation if they can’t get enough money to buy what they need.    Deflation    When the value of money itself increases, the prices of everything for sale in that money fall. Such a fall in the general price level (not prices of individual goods) is known as “deflation.” It is typically caused by there being insufficient money in circulation to meet people’s demand for it. Those who have money are happy because they are becoming wealthier. But someone, somewhere, is going hungry.      I often hear people saying deflation is good for the poor because their money goes further. When deflation is caused by technological advancements, this can be true. Technological advancements enable humans to produce more for less, and this can feed through into lower prices, which benefit consumers. But deflation caused by money scarcity can never be good for the poor. Money scarcity always and everywhere means someone goes hungry.      Deflation due to sustained money scarcity destroys the economy and wrecks lives. At the limit, it causes mass starvation. This is not just because saving money takes it out of circulation, leaving less to go round. There’s another reason, too – and it is this one that keeps central bankers awake at night.    Deflation caused by money scarcity can never be good for the poor. Money scarcity always and everywhere means someone goes hungry    When the price of money rises relentlessly, people will spend as little as they can. After all, who is going to spend money if they know it will be worth more tomorrow? In Japan today, expectations that money will continually rise in value (or that consumer prices will continually fall) has kept economic growth low for a very long time despite the best efforts of both the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan to encourage people to spend more.      But without their efforts, things could be much worse. Falling consumer spending can trigger a disastrous deflationary spiral. As consumer spending falls, companies cut production, reduce wages and lay off staff. Falling incomes then force people to cut back spending even more, and prices fall even more, forcing companies out of business at the cost of more jobs resulting in further consumer spending cuts. Sometimes, prices can even fall to zero – but this doesn’t mean the goods aren’t wanted.      In his Depression-era novel “The Grapes of Wrath,” John Steinbeck describes Californian farmers leaving peaches to fall from the trees because it was not worth picking them. This apparent “overproduction” led to calls for farms and businesses to be “liquidated” and people to lose their jobs, because apparently no-one needed these good. But at the same time as Californian farmers were allowing their peaches to rot, unemployed migrants from Oklahoma were starving. The economist Irving Fisher tersely commented that “a cause of the common notion of overproduction was mistaking too little money for too much goods.”      Why was there so little money during the Great Depression that prices crashed to zero and yet people starved? The consensus among economists is the U.S.’ determination to remain on the gold standard after the Wall Street Crash in 1929 forced it to keep the money supply very tight and rein in government spending. After the U.S. left the gold standard in 1933 and President Franklin Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, the economy recovered to some extent, though there was a second recession in 1937 that is generally ascribed to premature tightening of monetary policy. The U.S. economy didn’t really recover from the Depression until World War II, when both the Federal Reserve and the government turned on the money taps. It is a tragedy that the government would ensure there was sufficient money to produce armaments but not enable the entire U.S. population to buy food and shelter.      The battle between savers and spenders is played out not just in Great Depressions, but in every boom and bust cycle. During the prolonged recession after the 2008 financial crisis, there were similar debates about overproduction, though at the time we called it “abundance.” Now, we can see there was no abundance, only insufficient money: the Fed’s quantitative easing didn’t reach Main Street, banks weren’t lending, scared people were paying down debt (which, economically speaking, is a form of saving), and the U.S. government’s spending was constrained by arguments over the debt ceiling.      See also: Frances Coppola - Scarcity Gives Bitcoin Value, but Not the Way You Think      Now we are in another recession, and this time it is being played differently. Both the Fed and the U.S. government have turned on the money taps. Those who want to hold money as a store of value are screaming about negative interest rates and the possibility of inflation from all this money creation. But the purpose of all this money creation is to ensure that, unlike previous contractions, we don’t mistake too little money for too much goods and end up with people going hungry.      I believe that ensuring no one goes hungry is much more important than preserving the wealth of people who have money. After all, people don’t have to keep their wealth in the form of money, there are a variety of assets that they can use as hedges against inflation, including – now – bitcoin.

So I’d rather money wasn’t deliberately kept scarce to placate savers. Let the supply of money respond to demand for it. When everyone wants to save in the form of money, you need to produce more of it so those who need to spend money don’t starve.

Distributed Denial of Secrets founder Emma Best said the hacked data contains public posts, profiles and hashed passwords, as well as private account posts and messages.  ""It contains pretty much everything on Gab, including user data and private posts, everything someone needs to run a nearly complete analysis on Gab users and content,"" Best wrote in a message to Wired.  Data of former U.S. President Donald J. Trump's account is included in the data hoard, according to an archived post by Gab CEO Andrew Torba (WARNING: Contains offensive language).  In a blog post Friday, Torba told users the company is undertaking a ""full security audit"" and cast doubt on the extent of the data stolen.  ""Gab collects very little from our users in terms of personal information,"" he wrote. ""It is entirely possible for a user of the site to be unidentifiable based on the information they provide at login. ... [and] we have no indication that e-mail addresses were compromised.""  The data was siphoned from Gab's servers by a hacktivist identified as ""JaXpArO and My Little Anonymous Revival Project"" in an attempt to expose the platform's right-wing users, WIRED said.  Distributed Denial of Secrets said it is offering the data to journalists and researchers for analysis, but is not making it public over privacy concerns.  Trump had set up a Gab account after being suspended from Twitter in early January. Gab's rank among websites globally has climbed from 7,119 to 1,834 in the last 90 days, according to Amazon's Alexa, possibly reflecting an influx of fringe voices banned or frustrated by larger platforms' moderation policies.

Matter Labs, which first released its zero-knowledge rollup (ZK-rollup) product in December 2019, raised an undisclosed sum with limited partners “to preserve the dominance of the community share in the future zkSync network,” Matter Labs CEO Alex Gluchowski told CoinDesk in a Telegram message.      “The crypto community will strongly prefer solutions with the least compromises on security, decentralization and [user experience],” the startup said in a blog post shared in advance with CoinDesk. “This is what makes ZK-rollup tech so important. It relies on pure cryptography rather than game-theoretic mechanisms, and is thus the only scaling approach with no upper bound on the value it can securely handle in L2.”    Read more: Matter Labs Unveils Layer 2 Scaling Solution for Ethereum Payments    The round was joined by a host of cryptocurrency projects that are considering adding zkSync, including Coinbase, Aave, Curve Finance, CoinGecko and Balancer, among others. The round also included venture capital firms Placeholder, 1kx and Dragonfly Capital.      Gluchowski said numerous cryptocurrency wallets are in various stages of integrating zkSync, including Argent. Crypto exchange partners are likely to integrate the tech directly as well, he said.    War for L2?    The funding round comes at a time when historic gas fees have plagued the leading blockchain for decentralized applications. For example, a simple transfer on Ethereum cost up to $40 last week. Rollups are considered the prime method addressing this issue – at least in the short term until Ethereum 2.0 is fully developed.      Rollups are off-chain batches of transactions that settle as one transaction on a base layer. They come in two forms: zero-knowledge (ZKR) and Optimistic (ORU). The former rely on a mathematical proof to settle the lump payment without committing fraud. Optimistic rollups rely on a slashable bond and validators who watch for fraud.      A chief distinction between ORU and ZKR has been the latter’s limited interoperability with virtual machines. Yet, Matter Labs has “found a way to make ZK-rollups EVM-compatible in a very efficient way” using another privacy tech called “recursive PLONK,” Gluchowski said. A solution to this issue could make ZK-rollups a more favorable solution for decentralized applications (dapps).    Read more: Andreessen Horowitz Leads $25M Round in Ethereum Scaling Solution    Optimism is the most well known proponent of ORU. The firm also recently closed a round, booking $25 million in a Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).      Gluchowski said Matter Labs is singularly focused on zkSync, and not other “L2 bridges” like Matic’s new Polygon Network. “We're focused on zkSync as the single [layer 2] network, because you can only get seamless composability within the same L2,” he said.",POSITIVE,없음,BAL | BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | EXCHANGE | MATIC,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2021/03/01/usv-leads-round-in-matter-labs-as-ethereum-scaling-wars-intensify,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/19101a8169aea4277d7d211c9d387d073e000773-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The energy-intensive nature of bitcoin mining and potential regulatory hurdles could hamper bitcoin's progress to the point where the cryptocurrency could end up ""losing most its value over time,"" BCA Research said, according to a Bloomberghttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-long-term-value-doubted-042342617.html report on Monday.    According to Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, bitcoin's annualized electricity consumption now equals Argentina's annual carbon footprint.      A Bloomberg article recently called bitcoin mining a ""dirty business,"" though CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter called the analysis ""flawed."" And U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said last month that bitcoin is a ""highly speculative asset"" and an ""extremely inefficient"" way to conduct monetary transactions.      BCA Research's chief market strategist, Peter Berezin, wrote in the report released Friday that the expense and slowness of bitcoin transactions make it ""unsuitable as a medium of exchange,"" further warning that environmental, social, and governance-focused (ESG) funds are likely to shun companies associated with the top cryptocurrency.      ""As ESG funds start to flee [b]itcoin, its price will begin a downward spiral. Stay away,"" Berezin noted.      According to the research firm, governments will work against bitcoin in a bid to avoid losing billions of dollars in revenue from seigniorage – the difference between the face value of money and the cost to produce it.      Also read: Crypto Long & Short: How Coinbase Going Public Is Reshaping Trust in Markets      But Berezin's warning is likely overblown, as major listed U.S. firms have been betting on bitcoin in recent months as a way to hedge against inflation and a devaluing dollar.

42433777,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4xLh,1614601005,Why $1 Million Bitcoin Is Coming,"Bitcoin is officially mainstream. By the end of the last mega-bull market in 2017, most of the world had heard of bitcoin. But after Tesla recently purchased $1.5 billion for its corporate treasury and not for a speculative research and development sleeve, those still thinking bitcoin was a fad exposed themselves as woefully under-informed.      Tesla’s purchase underpins something even more dramatic than mainstreaming bitcoin as a legitimate cash-replacement for the world’s largest corporate, financial, and government institutions. These sudden influxes in demand, including a handful of recent bond-issuance-fueled purchases by MicroStrategy, are having an extreme impact on the bitcoin price. I believe we’ll see the price of bitcoin above $1 million sooner than most people can fathom.    Nik Bhatia is the author of ""Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies"" (2021). He is a CFA charter holder and Adjunct Professor of Finance and Business Economics at the University of Southern California Marshall School of Business.    I understand that $50,000 is already slightly discombobulating to the investment community at large, but that bitcoin price is only associated with $1 trillion of total market value in a world of hundreds of trillions of dollars in global wealth. If bitcoin’s market value reached the size of the U.S. Treasury market, for example, its price would reach $1.5 million.      It’s easy to predict $1 million bitcoin given a long enough time horizon, considering the pace of crypto-adoption across industries and the willingness of governments and central banks to provide unlimited amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. But when faced with the math of how much $3.5 billion in bitcoin demand (Tesla with $1.5 billion and MicroStrategy with $2 billion) caused its price to move, the approximations led me to some staggering numbers.      Keep in mind that this exercise is far from scientific. The price of bitcoin has basically tripled since MicroStrategy’s first publicly announced debt issuance in December. While the company has been purchasing bitcoin since August, it accelerated its buy-program then by raising capital via the corporate bond market aiming to bolster its bitcoin treasury holdings. MicroStrategy U.S. dollar bond issuance has become a regularity ever since. Quantifying exactly how much of the price explosion since December was caused directly by Michael Saylor or Elon Musk is impossible. But it’s fun to guess.      During the weeks that Saylor and Musk purchased at least $1 billion worth of bitcoin, its price increased by several thousand dollars. We know that the entire price move during those weeks cannot be solely attributed to these technology giants. After some rough calculations and a hefty discount, I believe that a $1 billion bitcoin purchase resulted in at least a $25 billion increase in its total market value, or about $1,300 per bitcoin. I’m saying the $3.5 billion total purchased by MicroStrategy and Tesla over the past three months directly increased the bitcoin price by $5,000 of the $30,000 total increase over that time. Maybe the actual contribution is more or less than that, but that’s the guess with which I’ll extrapolate.    A $3.5 billion purchase triggered an explosion of $30,000. Imagine what a $10 billion purchase from Apple would unleash.    Bitcoin’s powerful role in today’s society as a non-government, counterparty-free, first-layer money is apparent and markedly pronounced in 2021. In my new book ""Layered Money: From Gold and Dollars to Bitcoin and Central Bank Digital Currencies,"" I make the argument that bitcoin will anchor the financial system in the future. But I failed to speculate on a bitcoin market value significantly higher than that of gold at $10 trillion, equating to a bitcoin price of $500,000. In retrospect, this was way too bearish given the information we gained from the market during February.      Let’s say that out of the $100 trillion worth of wealth in each of the following vehicles: real estate, public securities (stocks and bonds), and monetary instruments (government debt, bank deposits, money market funds), bitcoin manages to eke out a meagerly $1 trillion in new demand. Using a 25x multiplier given our estimations from MicroStrategy and Tesla, this would equate to a $25 trillion increase in market value, or $1.3 million per bitcoin.      I know this type of extrapolation is grandiose and extremely crude, but it doesn’t make the information any less dramatic.      See also: How 2,000 Years of Monetary History Led Us to Bitcoin, Feat. Nik Bhatia (podcast)      Bitcoin’s price is a landmine. A $3.5 billion purchase triggered an explosion of $30,000. Imagine what a $10 billion purchase from Apple would unleash. Imagine the chain reaction from a $100 billion purchase by the Bank of Japan in a new quantitative easing program. Then finally imagine the world coming into bitcoin in a wave of FOMO the financial world has never seen before. A bitcoin total market value above $20 trillion (equating to a price above $1 million per bitcoin) no longer seems extreme. It seems mild.      Bitcoin’s price ascent will surprise most people who haven’t fully grasped the supply inelasticity of bitcoin. No increase in price can lead to a supply response, because bitcoin’s supply is pre-programmed and universally agreed upon. Governments, banks, and companies can issue as many crypto-competitors as they desire, but the bitcoin land grab is gaining the characteristics of the demand for prime real estate in the world’s most beautiful buildings and scenic coastlines, for the rarest art and jewels, and for precious metal itself. It’s demanded as an inflation hedge in Latin America, a path to economic empowerment in Africa, and as a peaceful protest of QE-infinity in the West. It has its own instant-settlement mechanism in Lightning Network. Most important, bitcoin is decentralized. There’s nobody to subpoena or central server to seize if governments tried to bring the network to a halt.

While the perception of the cryptocurrency varies greatly, it is undoubtedly the inspiration for a blockchain-based economy and has created a new decentralized cryptocurrency market, according to the paper by Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (GPS), the bank's ""thought leadership"" arm.      Citi describes Bitcoin as blockchain's ""North Star,"" owing to its core innovations that formed the building blocks that launched the ecosystem. Whether or not it cedes this status to stablecoins or central banks digital currencies (CBDCs) depends on how it is able to deal with inefficiencies relating to speed, scale and so on.      It will also be significant whether institutional interest cools as life returns to normal post-COVID-19 and inflationary fears abate. ""Dampening (sic) institutional enthusiasm would remove a key source of support to Bitcoin and potentially the broader ecosystem, thus pushing it back to its more speculative roots,"" the bank paper argues.      Citi's conclusion references the oft-repeated quote by Arthur Schopenhauer: “All truth passes through three stages: First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as self-evident.”      See also: Citigroup Helping World Governments Build Digital Currencies, CEO Says      ""The fact that this progressions (sic) has occurred in just over a decade makes Bitcoin remarkable regardless of it future,"" the report concludes.

In a report released Friday, the central bank said a ""CBDC can be designed to promote non-anonymity at the individual level, monitor transactions, promote financial inclusion by direct benefit fiscal transfer, pumping central bank 'helicopter money' and even direct public consumption to a select basket of goods and services to increase aggregate demand and social welfare.""      Helicopter money refers to distributing large sums of money directly into consumers' bank accounts to support the economy during times of stress, such as the recent coronavirus crisis. Observers told CoinDesk last year that CBDCs could speed money transfers to consumers but also spur inflation.      According to the RBI, an interest-bearing CBDC would improve an economy's ability to respond to changes in the policy interest rate and enhance monetary policy transmission.      In emerging markets with large-scale capital inflows, a CBDC can act as an instrument of ""sterilization,"" alleviating the constraint posed by a finite stock of government securities on the central bank balance sheet, it said.      The RBI, however, cautioned that a CBDC could lead to banking sector disintermediation.      ""CBDC is, however, not an unmixed blessing – it poses a risk of disintermediation of the banking system, more so if the commercial banking system is perceived to be fragile,"" per the report.      ""The public can convert their CASA (current account savings account) deposits with banks into CBDC, thereby raising the cost of bank-based financial intermediation with implications for growth and financial stability,"" the regulator said. Thus, banks may lose importance as the primary channel through with monetary policy is implemented.      Also read: Debate Rages on Whether a Digital Dollar Will Unleash Inflation      In simple terms, the public may hold large sums of an interest-bearing CBDC, forcing commercial banks to raise interest paid on deposits to retain customers. In turn, banks would either experience tightening of margins or have to charge higher interest rates on loans, as previously noted by the International Monetary Fund.      The RBI report also expressed concerns over CBDC designs promoting anonymity, as they could potentially aid money laundering and terrorism financing.      The Indian government is currently considering a bill that would facilitate development of a CBDC and ban ""private cryptocurrencies.""",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2021/03/01/indias-central-bank-sees-pros-and-cons-with-national-digital-currency,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bc587576367730be0ea6054edcd434e424b4cbee-1500x927.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42433780,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyP4xRh,1614589821,Bitcoin Bounces Back Above $47K Despite Bearish Chart Pattern,"Bitcoin regained some lost ground early on Monday, so far ignoring early indications of a bearish reversal on the weekly chart.      The cryptocurrency climbed a high of $47, 162 during the European morning, having dropped to $43,119 on Sunday – its lowest point since Feb. 8. Bitcoin is up 5% over 24 hours near $47,230 at press time.      The rise comes despite signs of bearish trend reversal on a longer-duration technical chart. The cryptocurrency fell 21% in the seven days to Feb. 28, despite multiple favorable market news events, forming a bearish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart.      The candlestick pattern indicates a reversal to bearish conditions, as sellers succeeded in pushing prices below the previous week's ""opening"" price (on Monday at 00:00 UTC) .      A similar bearish engulfing pattern marked an end of the previous bull market in December 2017. The cryptocurrency then entered a 12-month long bear market which bottomed following an 83% drop to lows near $3,100.      While it's too early to call an end of the bull market, the bearish engulfing pattern may bring some chart-driven selling.      Blockchain data also shows signs of cooling down in demand. The total number of bitcoin addresses with less than 0.01 BTC has also fallen slightly, according to data from Glassnode, indicating retail investment has begun to ease. The same can be said for wallet addresses containing 1 BTC all the way up to 1,000 BTC, where interest among institutional buyers appears to be capped.      See also: Crypto Long & Short: How Coinbase Going Public Is Reshaping Trust in Markets      That said, the engulfing candle pattern is just one signal amongst many market indicators and historical data shows the cryptocurrency saw multiple corrections of 30%–39% during the 2017 bull market.      ""BTC has found temporary footing,"" Jehan Chu, managing partner at cryptocurrency investment firm Kenetic Capital, told CoinDesk via WhatsApp. ""Institutions and long-term investors are forming a solid backdrop and speculators smell a buying opportunity.""

42386027,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUXBQtoz,1614587976,"Bots Encouraged Buying of GameStop, Dogecoin in Meme Trading Craze: Report","The buying frenzy that sparked a rush into GameStop (GME) and dogecoin recently was likely amplified by trading bots, according to analysis from a Massachusetts-based cybersecurity company.      As reported by Reuters on Saturday, PiiQ Media says it found patterns in posts and keywords posted to social media platforms during set times each day suggesting bots were driving the craze. It also compared such posts to unrelated stocks for comparison.      However, the company is uncertain how much impact the bots may have played in driving trading.      Based on its analysis, the company says foreign actors may have helped stir up the craze in buying of GME and other ""meme stocks"" when Reddit groups united to drive prices higher and ""short squeeze"" large hedge funds.      That's despite Reddit's CEO Steve Huffman's comments to a U.S. congressional committee in February in which he denied bots or fake accounts had played a ""significant role"" in message traffic on the GameStop subreddit, r/GameStop.      In its analysis of posts on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Youtube, PiiQ's analysis examined patterns of keywords such as ""Hold the Line"" and ""GME"" in conversations between Jan. 28 and Feb. 18.      The analysis shows regular frequent posting at set times during the trading day, according to the report.      “We saw clear patterns of artificial behavior across the other four social media platforms,"" said PiiQ CTO Aaron Barr in the report. ""When you think of organic content, it’s variable in the day, variable day to day. It doesn’t have the exact same pattern every day for a month.""      See also: Investors Pump $250M Into Reddit Following Social Media Site’s Role in GameStop Mania      The cybersecurity company believes there are currently tens of thousands of bot accounts hyping GME, other meme stocks and DOGE.
