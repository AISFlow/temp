42398026,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDxR,1414535429,Crypto 2.0 Industry Dismisses SEC Crackdown Rumors,"Following rumors that prominent members of the sector have been receiving requests for information from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), members of the crypto 2.0 segment of the bitcoin community are now stepping forward to deny these claims.  The reports first surfaced on 27th October via bitcoin blog Coinfire, which claims to have received a copy of a letter allegedly sent from the SEC to a number of open-source platform providers such as Counterparty and crowdfunding platforms like Cryptostocks. Together, such technologies and services, enable users to invest in a wide range of products that progress beyond financial assets to more experimental applications of bitcoin.  Crypto 2.0 protocol providers such as Mastercoin and Counterparty, which use protocols built on top of bitcoin to enable asset trading, told CoinDesk that they have not received any letters or communications from the SEC, a sentiment that was echoed by the industry's business community.  Craig Sellars, CTO of the Mastercoin Foundation, the organisation that advocates for the use of the mastercoin protocol, said:  “The foundation has not had any communication with the SEC, and has not received any communication (letters, subpoenas, etc) from them. To my knowledge, none of the projects using the Master Protocol have received anything from the SEC, either (and we’ve received confirmation from several).”  Adam Krellenstein, co-founder and chief architect of Counterparty, added simply: “None of [the Counterparty team] has gotten any letters at all like that.”  Members of the business community that is building on top of crypto 2.0 protocols also reported that they have not received letters from the SEC. This included MaidSafe, the decentralized storage system that raised $7m through a Mastercoin crowdsale; bitcoin startup incubator Seedcoin, which raised capital for a seed-stage startup fund through fundraising company Havelock Investments; and decentralized crowdfunding startup Swarm.  The SEC told CoinDesk it had “no comment” on the veracity of the reports.  Nonetheless, the rumors have created a storm of controversy across social networking platforms such as Reddit and Twitter, as news came just hours after a FinCEN ruling aimed at defining bitcoin processors and exchanges as money transmitters.  Protocol providers encourage appropriate use  Counterparty and Mastercoin both used the reports to emphasize that they offer open-source software platforms, and therefore are not responsible for how others may use the asset trading platforms that they provide.  “The software that we develop, like all capable software, may be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes,” Krellenstein said. “We do not condone the creation of unregistered securities on the Counterparty network, but we have no control over their issuance.”  Krellenstein also noted that he does not consider Counterparty’s protocol-specific currency, XCP, to be a security. A small amount of XCP must be used to create a new asset on the platform, while all bets must be placed in XCP.  Sellars went on to encourage mastercoin platform users to focus on creating tokens with functional components and to refrain from using them merely to represent ownership in any entity. “The Master Protocol as an open-source platform is not intended for securities issuance,” he added.  NXTorganization  , an informal community body representing the NXT protocol, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Crypto 2.0 businesses react  Companies built on top of crypto 2.0 platforms, likewise, stressed that they are based outside the US and have no intention of offering securities.  Swarm founder Joel Dietz said that while his platform would like to offer securities at some point, this would be contingent on US regulation allowing such issuances.  “We are not offering securities, [and] we have no intention of offering securities in the near future,” he said.  MaidSafe said it has received no letters, stressing that it is based in Scotland, falling under laws set by the UK, not the US, while Havelock commented only that it is located and regulated in Panama.  Storj founder Shawn Wilkinson said that his decentralized storage company, which raised more than 900 BTC in a crowdsale earlier this year, has not received a letter, and reiterated that he believes his business is not operating in conflict with US laws.  ""We are staying far away from securities, equity, investments,"" Wilkinson said. ""If you look in our crowdsale terms we were very clear about that.""  Appcoins, not equities  Lawyers representing the sector have been keen to stress that crypto 2.0 projects seek to frame any investment offerings in specific ways that avoid common terminologies associated with the sale of securities.  Perkins Coie  ’s Jacob Farber, speaking last week about Overstock’s decentralized stock exchange platform Medici, moved to distance the project from the past ICOs (initial coin offerings) that have been conducted in the space.  “As far as I'm concerned this is an entirely different offering than the coin raises that have occurred to date,” Farber said. “These for one reason or another have all been predicated on the view that the coin being sold is not a security. So it wasn't within the SEC's jurisdiction, or that was the rationale.”  Sellars stressed that Mastercoin encourages those who use its platform to create appcoins, not equities, meaning tokens that allow for the access of a network as opposed to ones that represent the share of any company.  “The problem with tokens is they are so flexible, it’s how you treat them,” he said.

42398028,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDwS,1414533069,US Senator: Dark Market Fight Requires More Funding,"US Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) has called for a crackdown on the dark web following reports that illicit marketplaces are thriving even after the government shutdown of Silk Road.  In an open letter addressed to Attorney General Eric Holder and published by Schumer’s office on 27th October, the senator pledged to both secure additional funding for anti-dark web activities and continue pressing for increased oversight of technologies that facilitate such activities. The letter cited the Tor network and bitcoin as mechanisms used by criminals to help conceal the global drug trade.  In a statement, Schumer said that he expects the US Justice Department to step up its fight against illicit drug trades, emphasizing the need for more funds to be pledged to the effort:  “I look forward to a Department of Justice review of their protocols, and will fight to increase their funding for this purpose, so that these officials do not have one hand tied behind their back in the evolving world of these online drug bazaars.”  The senior senator from New York has sent mixed messages to date to the digital currency industry. For example, Schumer has voiced opposition to bitcoin, once calling the technology a tool for money launderers. Yet nearly a year ago, the senator said on Twitter that the technology held promise ahead of a then-upcoming hearing on digital currency.  CoinDesk reached out to Schumer’s office for comment but did not receive an immediate reply.  Schumer makes case against dark web  In the letter, the US senator cited reports that encryption methods have enabled illicit marketplaces to function in the aftermath of the Silk Road shutdown. The number of sites that offer illicit drug purchasing and sales services has grown significantly in the past year, according to recent research.  Schumer blasted the dark web ecosystem and pressed for more action against its bad actors, arguing that law enforcement agencies both in the US and abroad aren’t doing enough to stop the perceived threat.  He said:  “These websites, by allowing users to rate the delivery services of sellers and by offering any drugs imaginable under the sun, are nothing less than an all-you-can order buffet of contraband that need to be investigated and targeted with more intensity.”  Schumer’s office said in its statement that the requested funding would go to hiring more cybercrime experts at the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as state-based agencies in New York. These funds would address what Schumer called a chronic staffing issue that he says further encourages would-be drug traffickers who frequent dark web marketplaces.  “Currently, there are not enough people to target these websites,” the office added.  Rise of drug markets could continue  Schumer’s letter did not outline steps beyond increased funding for combating the rise of dark web marketplaces. However, the senator acknowledged the complications involved in the process of investigating drug-related cybercrime, and conceded that federal officials lack many of the resources needed to address the ecosystem effectively.  According to James Martin, senior lecturer and researcher at the Macquarie University Centre for Policing, Intelligence and Counter-Terrorism, the rise in dark web marketplaces reflects a pattern seen among general technological growth.  Speaking to CoinDesk, Martin commented that it’s possible that more marketplaces will emerge as new ones are taken down by federal authorities, concluding:  “There are compelling reasons to speculate that the online drugs trade is going to expand further in years to come.""

42398038,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE7H,1414524338,"Kraken Announces Return to USD Market, Launch of GBP Trading","Kraken has partnered with Luxembourg-based payment solution specialist PayCash to add GBP trading and reinstate USD deposits to its bitcoin exchange platform.  The news comes amid an uptick in activity from the San Francisco-based startup, which announced it would begin operating in Japan by the end of October. Kraken further confirmed that clients in 28 EU member states will now have access to USD and GBP deposits, developments it characterized as being in line with its goal of becoming a leading global bitcoin exchange.  The company framed the partnership as one that would help it reinstate a more robust exchange service, while appealing to new partners such as banks, hedge funds and institutional investors in Europe. Notably, Kraken has been operating without full US dollar withdrawals and deposits since February, when it parted ways with its former US banking partner.  Kraken CEO Jesse Powell said:  “Our clients have asked about this since we stopped servicing USD, and we are proud to say we are making good on an old promise.”  Marcus Becker, chief marketing officer at PayCash, told CoinDesk that the move is also indicative of how his company is looking to capitalize on its position to form new partnerships in the bitcoin space.  “We offer payment as a service, meaning companies that don’t have their own money license, we enable them to offer e-money services,” Becker said. “[We’re seeking] to enable players in the wider area of cryptocurrencies to be connected to the old or the existing payment world.”  The announcement marks the second notable partnership for Kraken in the European market, following the news it had aligned with Germany’s Fidor Bank in October 2013.  US market takes backseat  Speaking in an interview, Powell said that Kraken is currently able to offer crypto-to-crypto trading to its US clients, and that USD deposits are available in select states. However, he affirmed that the market remains a low priority for Kraken, even though it bases its operations in the US.  Powell cited the relative ease of working within European regulations as one reason for this strategy, but also spoke out against what he considered to be a worsening environment for US bitcoin startups.  ""I still see it as a compliance quagmire,"" Powell said. ""It’s extremely difficult to operate legally in the US, and even if you had your licenses to operate, you’d still need to solve the problem of giving yourself a bank account.""  While he expressed a long-term desire to serve consumers in the US, Powell said that for now, Kraken's focus will be on localizing its website in Europe and adding new, country-specific payment methods in the region.  Search for a partner over  The deal also marks the end of a much longer search for a partner for Kraken, and as such, Powell expressed enthusiasm about the agreement with PayCash.  “We have spent eight months looking for a strong partner, one with compliance capabilities, regulatory oversight, payments expertise and a technology focus,” Powell said, in a nod to the company’s past negative experiences.  Becker also indicated that is comfortable working with bitcoin clients, given what it characterized as its favorable environment for industry businesses.  “The space is just evolving, we feel quite comfortable,” he said.  Earlier this year, Luxembourg opened a public dialogue with bitcoin businesses, a development that led it to emerge as a potential destination for companies in the industry. PayCash currently offers point-of-sale (POS), online and peer-to-peer (p2p) payment solutions, as well as e-money services for partners.  New trading options  Although Kraken has long made USD/BTC trading available to its customers, volume levels were impacted by the lack of options for new dollars to be brought into the exchange.  However, Kraken's entrance to the European market may be more notable given the relatively limited number of GBP options available to local consumers. Kraken will compete in a market that includes Coinfloor, which launched its order-book exchange in March and recently added support for US dollar, euro and Polish zloty deposits.  Powell said he expects Kraken to appeal to the UK market as he believes his exchange can provide a compelling cost savings.  ""As far as I know, we're the only native pound bearer, where you deposit pounds and hold in pounds, and it's not converted into another currency, so it's probably going to be a cheaper option for most people,"" he added.  Data from Coinometrics indicates that Kraken’s BTC/EUR trading accounts for 99.32% of its total trading volumes, while figures for BitcoinCharts suggest Kraken is the current market leader in BTC/EUR trading.

42398024,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFDtV,1414512804,Taking Bitcoin Beyond the Banked,"Seven months ago, the Bitcoin Foundation formed the Committee for Financial Inclusion. Andreas Antonopoulos was to head it, and things looked promising for a while.  Since then, however, Antonopoulos has stepped down, following concerns about the foundation's management. ""No one stepped up as a replacement,"" said one senior executive at the foundation. Another confirmed that the Committee for Financial Inclusion was on hold for now.  In the meantime, most of the industry development around bitcoin – this levelling force that has so much potential for the unbanked – still seems to be run by a collection of people who are decidedly banked.  This begs the question: what part do the unbanked play in bitcoin, its use and evolution?  We can look at two bodies of evidence to find out who runs the industry atop this decentralized network: who's talking about bitcoin, and who owns it.  Who's talking?  Sampling a few events from CoinDesk's list of upcoming cryptocurrency conferences reveals an unsettling but also unsurprising truth: most of the people on the speaker lists are from relatively privileged backgrounds.  You'll find a sprinkling of academics here, and a smattering of venture capitalists there. You'll spot the watchers: analysts, and western journalists, like me. There's a gaggle of lawyers, and, of course, a gang of entrepreneurs, most of whom were from a particular demographic: young, white, and male, and often with a technology background.  You will find the occasional outlier. One past speaker is the CEO of a company created specifically to serve the unbanked. But these are anomalies. Even those events held in countries where a sizeable proportion of the population is unbanked feature speakers from the top end of the financial pyramid.  Where are the representatives from the other 2.5 billion who do not have access to financial institutions? The local grassroots financial activists? People from communities in poor, or undeveloped economies, using bitcoin to help better their environments?  Those unbanked communities aren't just in developing countries, by the way.  In the US, one in 12 households are unbanked – a number which is holding steady, if not slightly increasing.  Furthermore, another one in five are 'underbanked' (meaning that they have chequing accounts, but have used alternative financial services such as non-bank check cashing services or pawn shops). These households are just as in need of cheap financial services as those in other parts of the world.  Who's holding?  The other indicator is ownership. Analyses such as this one suggest that a relatively small number of players own a large percentage of the bitcoins. Some of those are owned by exchanges. Others are Satoshi's, say experts – and good for him – but there are more, owned by a small number of players.  Numbers from different analyses will vary, but it's pretty clear that there is a heavy concentration of ownership. Some are owned by financial players including the Winklevoss twins, who 18 months ago claimed to own 1% of all bitcoins mined.  The Bitcoin Investment Trust was said to own 100,000 bitcoins a year later, and other financial funds have been emerging in short order.  And then there are the early adopters who made it big with bitcoin, who have become celebrities in their own right.  This is natural, I suppose. Bitcoin's short-term destiny was always as a speculative instrument, which lends itself to hoarding as speculators anticipate an increase in value. It's damaging for both liquidity and equality alike, however.  Incidentally, a lack of liquidity and a disproportionate concentration of ownership among a small number of influencers also makes bitcoin a dangerous short- to mid-term investment vehicle, because those players can manipulate the value as they see fit. That makes the market less rational and efficient.  Tracking investments in cryptocurrency-based companies shows a potential trend towards more equality, but it's short lived.  CoinDesk's Q3 State of Bitcoin report shows a 35% increase in Latin American bitcoin investments, but that region's funding is still miniscule as a proportion of overall bitcoin investments. In the meantime, European bitcoin firms saw a massive 60% jump during the quarter.  Empowering communities  If we want to make bitcoin truly inclusive – to fuel microfinance projects, say, or to help provide financial services to the unbanked at home and away – then this concentration of power has to change.  Speech is power, and we need to hear voices from other communities. Property is power, and the concentrated ownership of bitcoin must be diluted.  This dilution is likely to happen not from the top down, but from the bottom up. The important gap here consists of local community leaders in areas where traditional financial services aren't working.  These communities must be empowered to work with bitcoin, to help grease the financial wheels and get funds flowing. Ideally, they should have some voices in its direction too.  The success of such empowering projects depends in part on positive regulation. It also depends on liquidity, which will develop as people begin treating bitcoin as a means of exchange, rather than as a speculative instrument.  We still have a way to go here, though. People continue to focus more on the price of their investments than they do on how bitcoin can be used as a means of exchange. More than half of the top 10 stories on CoinDesk in Q3 were about bitcoin's price.  Promising signs  It isn't all doom and gloom. There are some promising signs of activity in traditionally excluded communities.  The Women's Annex Foundation has pledged to use bitcoin as a way to reward Afghan girls for social media engagement and video production. Those girls may otherwise have their money confiscated by their families to discourage independence.  We have seen bitcoin vouchers launched to help the unbanked in London and Africa, who can now buy bitcoin over the counter, without access to the Internet, or a phone even. In Indonesia, where 80% of people are unbanked, Indomaret is providing over-the-counter bitcoin sales.  In the US, Expresscoin hopes to cater for those one-in-12 unbanked users with its bitcoin sales service. Even Coinbase, which Expresscoin sees as a competitor, has said that it's interested in this market.  Others are targeting empowerment through exchanges. BlinkTrade is enabling bitcoin brokers from Africa to Venezuela the chance to run their own online bitcoin exchanges on its platform.  And then, there are remittances. This is the market that bitcoin was made to serve. Getting money home is a big problem for low-income migrant workers. Coins.ph and others are tackling that problem for Filipino workers. Beam is doing the same for Ghana and Nigeria.  But the remittances market too, is fraught with challenges, including the need for computing infrastructure at the receiving end, along with regulatory burdens.  Let's not repeat history  It's encouraging to see bitcoin usage trickling into non-privileged communities, even as ownership and control still appear to be concentrated among particular demographics.  We are, after all, at an early stage in the life of this cryptocurrency, where a financial ecosystem and a layer of business services are still being built.  As the Bitcoin Foundation's Micky Malka has said, ""You cannot expect bitcoin at five years old to take all that responsibility and act like a grown-up. It is still a toddler.""  But a young initiative has multiple possible futures. Earlier this year, Oxfam found that around 1% of the world's population owns half of its wealth. Our opportunity is to avoid history repeating itself, by taking action early, so that we don't end up repeating the same centralisation of power.  Antonopoulos is hoping to start work again on financial inclusion sometime in the next month. Let's hope that, as the thriving cryptocurrency industry develops, banking the unbanked takes a stronger shape as a concerted effort, with solid backing.

42398041,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbFE8G,1414506492,Former SEC Chair Takes Advisory Roles at BitPay and Vaurum,"The Wall Street Journal reported today that consultant Arthur Levitt – who served as SEC chairman from 1993 to 2001 and was actually the longest-serving person in that role – has joined the boards in order to guide the bitcoin firms' approach to financial regulation.  Levitt affirmed he was impressed by the ""innovative energy"" of the digital currency industry's youthful representatives, but that they remained unaware of the inevitable regulatory issues their companies would face in winning the public's trust.  Payments platform BitPay has long been established as one of bitcoin's major companies with an emphasis on promoting bitcoin use among consumers.  Vaurum  , a later entrant to the space, targets its exchange services instead at the financial industry, including banks and hedge funds. The latter company received $4m in seed funding in May.  Boost for acceptance  Levitt's comments and board appointments could well herald a new era in bitcoin's relationship with those regulating the traditional financial world.  Vaurum CEO Avish Bhama told CoinDesk the appointment would also help with general acceptance, saying:  ""Blockchain technology is poised to transform the financial services world, but will continue to remain an intellectual curiosity until it has a compelling everyday use case. Arthur Levitt brings additional validation to the space, and we’re pleased to work with him on our financial controls, banking relationships and regulatory compliance.""  The news comes just weeks after Coinbase, another major player in the US digital currency space, appointed a former Senate aide to liaise with Congress and notable bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain hired attorney Marco Santori as global policy counsel.  Compliance increasingly important  Earlier today, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) revealed it regards digital currency exchanges as money services businesses even where no fiat currencies are exchanged or transferred outside the companies themselves.  A blog post by BitPay's Tony Gallippi from March 2013 suggested the company did not regard itself as a money transmitter, despite voluntarily registering itself with FinCEN in 2011.  The WSJ report also suggested trust issues and ""regulatory uncertainty"" in both the US and China surrounding bitcoin could be responsible for the 70% price decline since the beginning of 2014.  Levitt said that while bitcoin's emergence would prove good for competition in the finance industry at large, bitcoin firms needed to prioritize a better understanding of the technology and its implications.

42377732,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NFp,1414497695,BitPay Project Aims to Do for Networks What Bitcoin Did for Currency,"BitPay took to the stage to announce an intriguing new project called Foxtrot at the San Francisco Bitcoin Developer Meetup yesterday.  BitPay  CEO Stephen Pair made the presentation, explaining that the open-source effort is designed as a simple, secure and decentralized communications network based on bitcoin cryptography.  The company describes Foxtrot as a decentralized routing network that enables easy peer-to-peer (p2p) communications, with built-in mechanisms for peer discovery, creation of services addressable by public keys and establishing encrypted connections.  Pair explained:  “Foxtrot is a network that allows nodes to communicate with one another.”  Enhanced security and privacy  Like bitcoin  , Foxtrot is based on elliptic curve cryptography and enables a trustless p2p network of nodes specifically for networking and communications.  ""This works in a very similar way to bitcoin itself,"" Pair told the meetup.  If they were to gain traction, p2p connections on the scale of the Internet could bring greatly increased security and privacy.  In order to bring this about, BitPay is using some of its other technologies to build Foxtrot, including Insight, an open-source stack that interfaces with a full bitcoin node, and Copay, the company's own multi-signature wallet.  The BitPay CEO made the proclamation that while Foxtrot is currently in its early stages, he could see the project as a way to replace TCP/IP, although he conceded there would need to be a lot of work done in order to accomplish that goal.  Monetizing network connections  In addition to practical applications BitPay is planning to use Foxtrot internally; for example, in protecting its own network from attacks by utilizing distributed peer connections.  Pair suggested that networks in general could incentivize themselves with Foxtrot, saying: ""The idea here is that nodes would charge money for a data connection,"" he said.  The concept could include Internet service providers (ISPs) automatically transacting with each other with stores of value via nodes. This could simplify some aspects of the Internet, as ISPs often compensate one another for network traffic by using complex peering agreements.  Pair said:  ""I used to work in networking, and I think it is really interesting to think about how ISPs can charge each other for connections. It could totally change the economics how the Internet works.""  Additionally, he said, a p2p scheme like Foxtrot could innovate networking by securing systems with cryptography and end-to-end encryption, which Foxtrot also provides.  Ultimately, Foxtrot could provide protection against hacking, so the project is being built to protect BitPay's own systems.  Pair said:  ""We’re building something that [for example] allows our accounting system to be secured by the bitcoin network.""  Additional features planned  Pair cautioned that the Foxtrot project is in its infancy and explained that BitPay wants to add many more features – such as stealth addresses to better protect nodes – to the project.  Pair added that the technology would need to be used on the outer edges of networks to begin with, then move inwards to more complex networks, such as those run by ISPs.""You would want to start small at the edges, like with wireless mesh nets,"" he explained.  Starting today, Foxtrot is openly available on GitHub.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42377737,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX73NOd,1414490420,"Trucoin Re-Enters Market, Expands Bitcoin Buying Service to 32 US States","Trucoin has announced it will expand its bitcoin buying service to consumers in 32 US states over the next few weeks.  The news follows three months of inactivity for the company, and what it called its successful eight-state beta test earlier this year. Customers in states served by the company will be able to purchase bitcoin using payment options such as MasterCard and Visa credit and debit cards.  Trucoin  co-founder and president Chris Brunner echoed past remarks in a new interview with CoinDesk, emphasizing that the Georgia-based company aims to offer what it believes is the most compliant bitcoin buying and wallet storage solution on the US market.  Brunner said:  ""One of the major advantages of dealing with a regulated company from a consumer standpoint is that regulators do a lot of auditing and there are a lot of controls in place that don't exist. Mt Gox, that type of thing, could not happen in a situation where the regulated company is being audited.""  In addition to anti-money laundering (AML) and Bank Security Act (BSA) compliance, Brunner also noted that the company's wallets meet standards set by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) that cover the handling of consumer data.  ""We set out to make bitcoin seamless for the average user, in a legal and easy way, and we haven't veered from that at all,"" Brunner said. ""It took us longer to launch because it was important for us to be a company the bitcoin community could depend on long term.""  Generous daily limit  Trucoin VP of marketing and communication Brent James went on to stress that the company aims to offer a competitive customer experience that extends beyond simply its compliance features.  James noted Trucoin will have chat, email and phone support available to all users, and that customers who place orders will be notified via their desktop or mobile wallet as soon as their purchase is filled.  However, perhaps most notably, Brunner suggested that Trucoin users will be able to receive higher-than-average spending limits.  ""There have been one or two companies that have come up with processes that are nearly as quick as ours,"" Brunner explained, ""but the big disadvantage is that they don't have the fraud mitigation technology that we have. They're not able to offer a limit that I would consider to be useful.""  The end result is that Brunner said customers can purchase $200–$500 in bitcoin per day via the Trucoin platform.  New partnership  The news of the company's expansion also follows Trucoin's July announcement that it had ended its previous partnership with both National Check and Currency (NCC) and Presto Financial – the companies that previously acted as Trucoin's licensed money services partner in the US.  At the time, Brunner indicated that Trucoin would close its beta program in Florida, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, South Carolina and Texas, pending a new partnership.  ""We felt that we needed to do this now, so that we could ensure a substantially larger group of consumers have access to a fast and easy way to purchase bitcoin,"" Brunner said on 24th July.
