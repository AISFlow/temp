The Washington D.C.-based firm reached a settlement with the SEC in February over its 2017 initial coin offering. As part of the settlement, Gladius was supposed to refund investors who participated in the $12.7 million sale. The regulator said it would not impose any penalty on Gladius because the firm self-reported the token sale.      As part of the settlement, Gladius was required to file a registration statement by May 20, 2019, according to the Wall Street Journal. While the deadline was extended to Nov. 18, it is unclear whether the company actually filed the statement.      “Despite our best efforts, the company no longer has funds to continue operations,” the firm said in the announcement last week. “We regret to inform you that Gladius Network LLC has ceased operations effective immediately.”      The company plans to leave its code on GitHub for the next three months, allowing anyone who is interested to work on their own version of the project.      “We still believe in the power of our technology, and if anyone in the community is interested in pursuing it we welcome it,” Gladius said.      Gladius started to sell its GLA tokens in exchange for ether in October 2017, and aimed to incentivize people to use its network. The firm raised nearly 24,000 ETH when it completed the token sale in December that year, according to a press release from the SEC.      In November 2018, the SEC charged two crypto startups – CarrierEQ Inc., also known as Airfox, and Paragon Coin Inc. – with violating security registration requirements for their ICOs.      The two firms later agreed to register the ICOs as securities after settling these charges. The regulator said Airfox and Paragon Coin are among the first cases “imposing civil penalties solely on securities offering registration violations. (The Journal reports that both companies failed to pay the fines on time, though Airfox claims its deadline was extended through the end of December.)",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | SPONSORED | TOKEN SALE,David Pan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/11/25/unregistered-ico-issuer-gladius-shuts-down-9-months-after-sec-settlement,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d6410e701446e0448cc104f1a02edbb26bec70e8-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431185,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nXh,1574700620,Crypto Market's Overreaction to Xi's Blockchain Remark Prompts Tougher Crackdown,"Call it a self-defeating prophecy.       When President Xi Jinping praised blockchain technology as an opportunity that China should pounce on last month, many took it as an auspicious sign for the cryptocurrency market in the world’s second-largest economy.       This rosy interpretation led to the return of speculative fever surrounding not just major cryptocurrencies but also alleged crypto pump-and-dump schemes.       But that, in turn, has triggered another crackdown by local regulators, targeting exchanges, projects, media as well as blockchain and crypto-themed events – and dashing hopes for a crypto-friendly China.       After rallying as much as 30 percent within hours of Xi’s speech, the price of bitcoin has fallen back to a level even lower than it was before his remarks and dipped to a six-month low below $7,000 on Monday.       “I’ve called out countless time[s] already the initial pump is totally a[n] over-reaction, so a correction is well expected especially under the known CCP ‘carrot and stick’ strategy.” tweeted Dovey Wan, a founding partner at Primitive Ventures.       In what has become a defining episode of the clampdown, crypto news site The Block reported last week that Binance’s Shanghai office had shut down. The exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, initially denied that it even had an office in Shanghai, and took umbrage at the publication’s claim there had been a “police raid.”       The Block later softened the phrase to “visit by authorities,” but sources told CoinDesk that Binance has indeed had a presence in Shanghai for some time.       Dragon Television, a Shanghai local broadcast station, aired in a program on Monday night China time that Binance’s Shanghai office was closed and added the office was used by outsourced customer service staff and some developers.       'Air coins'    The local community was briefly rejuvenated by the leader’s remarks.       From Nov. 8 to 9, more than 4,000 people attended the World Blockchain Conference in Wuzhen, China, according to the event organizer 8btc. Speakers included representatives from traditional tech firms like Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, as well as those working in crypto exchanges, funds, projects and mining businesses.       Further supporting an optimistic outlook, a few days after Xi’s speech, the country’s top economic planning agency scrapped a proposal that would have recommended eliminating crypto mining from China, a global hub for such activity.       But then Beijing began tightening the screws.       On Nov. 14, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) Shanghai Bureau issued a notice to local government agencies in each district in the city to inspect and clear out businesses that offer crypto trading, fundraising, promotion and brokerage services. It later officially published the notice on its website, stating that it plans to nip the growing crypto fever in the bud.       And apparently, this is a nationwide effort. On Thursday, the Shenzhen Municipal Financial Regulatory Bureau issued a similar notice, vowing to crack down on initial coin offerings and fraudulent schemes that use blockchain as a marketing gimmick without any technological substance.       China Central Television (CCTV), a mouthpiece of the Chinese government, said in an article on Sunday that this is just the beginning as multiple cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hangzhou have all started taking similar measures.       To be sure, the crackdown has so far primarily targeted at what the state media called “air coins,” referring to those that are issued out of thin air without any real team or development, as well as smaller exchanges that would pump and dump these coins’ prices.       A Chinese government-backed report last week even claimed that 25,000 out of the 28,000 blockchain firms based in the country issued cryptocurrencies via illegal fundraising channels.       As a result, multiple state-owned media including CCTV, Xinhua, Economic Information Daily, and Securities Times, have all published news coverage over the past week to their nationwide audience about the return of “air coins” and the country’s crackdown efforts.     ‘Safety concerns’    Meanwhile, trading services of major exchanges by volume such as Huobi, OKEx and Binance, which still serve Chinese investors, have not been affected by the crackdown so far.       That said, there are signs that these trading platforms have taken a step back, at least for the time being, in terms of their operations, marketing and promotional activities.       For instance, OKEx’s official Chinese-language Weibo account had been regularly posting daily updates of cryptocurrency market analysis, announcements regarding listing certain tokens and its Jumpstart initial exchange offering activities.       Yet since Nov. 14, the firm’s Weibo account has so far been only publishing posts on blockchain 101, and news coverage about blockchain applications.       On the other hand, the official Weibo accounts of Binance and blockchain project Tron, are still suspended, due to user complaints of violating laws, regulations or Weibo’s service terms.       Further, many of the blockchain and crypto-themed events originally scheduled in Shanghai in recent weeks had been either canceled or scaled down, according to two event organizers, who spoke under the condition of anonymity due to safety concerns.       One organizer said the wave of cancelations was due to either safety reasons or venue providers declined to collaborate amid the crackdown news, even though the events were to discuss blockchain tech and crypto-economics in general.       The other organizer said events or meet-ups that did go ahead also tuned down the scale by making it invite-only or nixing panels related to trading.       The crackdown on exchanges and projects that are promoting speculation has also led to WeChat’s ban of several accounts that publish content about crypto trading to subscribers.       So far, the WeChat account of at least three bloggers, literally translated as “One Coin,” “Crypto Bond,” and “Trading Class” are all inaccessible on WeChat. Viewing the accounts’ information leads to a page that states: “Content is inaccessible as this account is banned after WeChat’s review of users’ complaint of the account violating related laws, regulations and policies.”",NEGATIVE,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TOKEN SALE,Wolfie Zhao,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/11/25/crypto-markets-overreaction-to-xis-blockchain-remark-prompts-tougher-crackdown,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7c229f7a97cf062baacfe9f163178c99b037c15-1200x800.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431180,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nPh,1574695809,"Another Class Lawsuit Claims Bitfinex, Tether Manipulated Bitcoin Market","Crypto exchange Bitfinex and its sister firm, stablecoin issuer Tether, have again been accused of working to manipulate the bitcoin markets.      A new class-action suit, filed by Eric Young and Adam Kurtz at the district court in the Western District of Washington on Nov. 22, draws heavily from details that emerged in the case brought by the New York attorney general in April against the same two firms.      It's also the second class action to have been brought in recent months relying on the New York case, which is still ongoing as the defendants appeal over whether they must continue to produce documentation. The attorney general claims, among other things, that that the tether (USDT) stablecoin was not fully backed by U.S. dollars.      In a lengthy list of claims, Young and Kurtz specifically allege that Bitfinex and Tether ""monopolized and conspired to monopolize the Bitcoin market,"" as well as manipulated the market, manipulated information or made inaccurate claims.      Further, ""Defendants’ misconduct caused prices of Bitcoin futures, and the prices of Bitcoin underlying the Bitcoin futures, to be artificial during the Class Period [Oct. 1, 2014 to present],"" Young and Kurtz say, adding:    ""Defendants' control of USD₮ issuances and Bitfinex permitted Defendants and their co-conspirators to coordinate purchases and sales with rising and falling Bitcoin prices. When Bitcoin prices were falling, Defendants and their co-conspirators printed USD₮s and artificially increased the price of Bitcoin. Once Defendants and their co-conspirators artificially inflated the price of Bitcoin, Defendants and their co-conspirators then converted the Bitcoin back into USD₮s to replenish Tether's reserves.""    Both lawsuits also cite a study authored by professors at the University of Texas at Austin claiming that a single Bitfinex account used USDT to inflate the price of bitcoin in the lead up to its 2017 all-time high of around $20,000.      While the case has been brought at the federal court in Washington State, Young and Kurtz are based in Pennsylvania and New York, respectively. Both say they are bitcoin traders who traded at artificial prices due to the alleged actions of the defendants.      ""At all relevant times, Defendants, including the employees that conducted Defendants’ affairs through illegal acts, knowingly and intentionally made false statements to U.S. Bitcoin investors and the public for the purpose of concealing Defendants’ scheme,"" the suit states, further alleging that the defendants profited at plaintiffs' expense.      Bitfinex took to its blog Sunday to call the Washington case ""mercenary and baseless,"" and suggest that such lawsuits ""are a continuing affront to the efforts and dedication of Bitfinex's customers and all participants in the digital currency ecosystem.""      ""As we predicted last month, mercenary lawyers continue to try to use Bitfinex and Tether to obtain a payday. To be clear, there will be no nuisance settlements or settlements of any kind reached.

Dennis Blieden committed the crimes while an executive at StyleHaul Inc. – a firm that provided marketing services for social media “influencers.” According to a U.S. Department of Justice news release, Blieden faces a statutory maximum sentence of 22 years in federal prison after admitting wire fraud and aggravated identity theft.      From October 2015 to March 2019, Blieden was controller and vice president of accounting and finance for StyleHaul, where he ""abused"" his control of company bank accounts to send money to his personal bank account, a plea agreement says. He used the stolen money to pay for personal expenses and his professional poker life, which he funded with cryptocurrency bought with the firm's money.      Said to have taken part in, and won, poker tournaments, Blieden apparently used company money to buy in to two competitions with $52,000 and $103,000, respectively. $1,204,000 was also paid in personal checks to other poker players. He also gambled online, transferring $8,473,734 of StyleHaul cash to his crypto accounts to fund that habit.      In order to cover up the thefts, Blieden created fake entries in StyleHaul’s books disguising wire transfers to his account as legitimate payments to clients, or as equity payments owed to him by the firm, court documents indicate. He also faked letters supposedly from Western Union suggesting he'd made wire transfers to a client who was owed money.      The former exec further brought the charge of aggravated identity theft upon himself by faking that his employer kept a beach-side condo in Mexico for use by clients and staff, which involved him forging the signature of another exec at StyleHaul. He admitted stealing $230,000 through the fake perk, says the DoJ.

42431190,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nhh,1574686800,What's Really Private in Crypto? Research on Grin Raises Questions,"For all cryptocurrency has done to raise awareness of privacy, it seems to have spurred more projects than workable coins.      Grin, launched in January 2019, is one such privacy initiative facing tough questions as the excitement around its Mimblewimble adaptation has not lived up to recent empirical scrutiny.      Ivan Bogatyy, researcher at investment fund Dragonfly Capital, dropped a Medium bombshell last Monday, disclosing an “attack” capable of identifying 96 percent of the active senders and receivers on the grin network through the employment of “sniffer nodes.”      As the smoke cleared, one question emerged: What is privacy in crypto, anyway?      Gathering praise from the likes of ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, litecoin creator Charlie Lee and others, Bogatyy detailed grin’s structural issues – issues, he claims, stemming from Mimblewimble itself.    Dreams of anonymity    Mimblewimble – the much-heralded privacy protocol created in 2016 – anonymizes transactions through batching inputs per block, like a CoinJoin. After mixing the numbers associated with a sender in a pool of similar transactions, equivalent values are spit out on the other side as unidentifiable outputs.      Styled a confidential transaction (CT), this process typically works pretty well once it scales to a large enough anonymity set, wherein the sheer number of inputs shields the knowledge about the outputs after a mixing. In CT, the amount and public addresses are never exposed, mainly because addresses don’t exist in the Mimblewimble universe, just transaction inputs and outputs.      The first two cryptocurrencies based on Mimblewimble launched in January 2019: grin and beam. But, for both coins, ""transaction graphing"" remains a problem.      A well-connected sniffer node can sit on either side of the CoinJoin in what is called “linking.” Built on the same peer-to-peer (P2P) network as bitcoin, nodes communicate changes to the ledger from one to another and a sniffer can pick out how transactions move by being well-connected to its peers. In fact, Bogatyy said it only took 200 of the 3,000 current peers on the grin blockchain to flesh out 96 percent of transaction sender and receiver addresses at the small cost of a $60 per week subscription to Amazon Web Services.      This issue was well known beforehand, however.      The Grin Foundation’s Open Research Problems page on GitHub publicly cited the problem as a point for future research along with analysis from Token Daily’s Mohamed Fouda over a year ago. Moreover, grin has never promised full anonymity, but only CT with the possibility of adding anonymity features down the road.    So what’s all the fuss about?    To Bogatyy, the research is about correcting public misunderstandings about privacy coins. But to Mimblewimble developers, the piece amounted to a smear.      “While some technical experts guessed that the vulnerability likely exists, I don't think anyone knew the extent,” Bogatyy said in an email. “Before I ran the experiments, I couldn't know myself it would be 96 percent.”      He said the goal of his research is to make the “technical knowledge more accessible.”      “I think Grin devs are very competent and don't overpromise, but the public perception diverged from the technical fundamentals and followed the legend a little too much,” Bogatyy said.    The promise of privacy coins    All privacy coins aren't created equal. Rather, a privacy coin is one iteration of a subjective vision of privacy externally limited by what distributed protocols are physically capable of accomplishing.      In the case of Mimblewimble, CT is not much more than bitcoin with throw-away public addresses plus hidden transaction amounts, according to zcash co-founder and cryptographer Ian Miers.      “But we all know intuitively what privacy means: if you pay your psychiatrist or purchase a series of banned books from an online market, no one learns you saw a doctor and no one is going to kick down your door and search your house for illicit books,” Miers said in an email.      But in the world of public blockchains, where transaction data can be viewed and verified by all participants, there's a catch.      “Because we all know cryptocurrency has a privacy issue, outsiders latch onto anything and hype it out of proportion,” Miers said.      Grin’s version of Mimblewimble is joined by others, namely beam, which Bogatyy also addressed in his research.      Noting the trouble with transaction graphing long ago, beam developers have implemented numerous amendments to Mimblewimble, including decoy outputs to break linkability, according to beam developer Guy Corem.      That’s why he’s taking issue with Bogatyy’s research.      “Beam and Grin developers were aware of transactions linkability from way before mainnets launched,” Corem said in a Telegram message. “[Bogatyy] didn't look at Beam's implementation. For example, in his technical write-up, he wrongfully stated that the decoys aren't being spent.”      Decoy improvements or not, Bogatyy remains unimpressed. Following transactions through whisper nodes remains too easy even with the added protections, Bogatyy said.      “Ultimately, the best version of decoy-heavy Mimblewimble would look like a worse version of Monero,” Bogatyy said on his GitHub page. (It should be noted that no privacy coins are listed in Dragonfly’s portfolio.)    Grin's response    To grin developers, Bogatyy’s views are far off the mark.      Writing in a Medium post, grin developer Daniel Lehnberg said Bogatyy confused basic points such as transaction outputs versus addresses in the Mimblewimble system, misstated grin’s original privacy claims and did not contact grin developers while saying he did.      As it relates to transaction graphing, Lehnberg called the 96 percent figure irrelevant.      “Other than that 'Output A spends to Output B', it’s less clear what exactly is being identified here or what else the author is able to accomplish with this information,"" Lehnberg wrote. ""While it would be desirable to avoid leaking the transaction graph, the graph alone doesn’t necessarily reveal sender and receiver outputs.""      But, as Miers points out, you can still trace grin transactions regardless if they have addresses or not.      “It’s like you have a map of some part of New York City but you just don’t which part because all the street names are missing. But the moment someone tells you the name of one intersection on the map, you can work out the rest,” Miers said. “The attack on Grin created this map with blank streets. You need one more step to give out the names, but that is the easy part.”      Furthermore, once you know a transaction’s beginning and end points, it doesn’t matter to anyone how much you spent, just that you spent it somewhere.      “So the world will learn you paid Pornhub or bought a lambo, but they won't directly know for how much,” said Miers. “It isn't useful unless it's combined with much stronger privacy technology.”    Low volumes    As ethereum's Buterin noted on Twitter, privacy depends on the number of users in an anonymity set: The more users mixing funds, the safer the funds pulled from the pool.      But it's different for grin due to the nature of its protocol, which natively doesn’t have addresses like bitcoin to match transactions to, grin's Lehnberg wrote on Medium:    ""Grin is still very young and has yet to reach its full potential. Eleven months into mainnet, there is low network usage. In the last 1000 blocks, 22% contained only a single tx (and 30% contained no tx), meaning their inputs and outputs are trivially linkable. This won’t change until there’s greater network usage, but it still does not imply that sender and receiver identities are revealed.""    Reviewing Bogatyy’s research, Lehnberg said he is skeptical of how he was able to “uncover who paid who in the Grin network,” as Bogatyy claimed on GitHub. Grin’s development team has only gone so far as to say the issue could reveal “entities,” not individuals.      “It's one thing to say, ‘oh this theoretical attack is really straightforward and easy to carry out,’ it's another to actually do it,” Lehnberg said on Telegram.      While the two sides may disagree over the technicals, Miers remains positive about Mimblewimble but characterizes grin as only a footnote in privacy coins' history.      “Grin is a project that shows a lot of promise, but right now it isn’t accurate to call it a privacy coin or even a privacy project,” Miers said.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | TRADING | RESEARCH,William Foxley,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2019/11/25/whats-really-private-in-crypto-research-on-grin-raises-questions,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5ae66552f64e5be005173e4b6b5a3e61ef58c239-1200x920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431179,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nNh,1574683200,French Central Banker Advocates for Blockchain-Based Settlements in Europe,"The central bank of France wants the eurozone to build a blockchain-based settlement system that will move euros more quickly and at less cost than with existing technologies.      In a speech Thursday, First Deputy Governor Denis Beau issued some of France’s strongest comments yet in support of distributed ledger technology (DLT), which he said likely solves many outstanding market issues.      One solution France is considering: a central bank digital currency (CBDC). Beau said the eurozone has a responsibility to at least consider a CBDC – especially because other “disorderly approaches and heterogeneous adaptations” could arise in its absence.      Cross-border payments also could be a particularly viable DLT use case, Beau said. Residents in the EU and beyond often wait extended periods for payments to wend between banks and their international partners, in the “correspondent banking model” that delivers an often insecure service for what he said was a high price.      Tokenized assets may give that method a jolt, he said. Combined with DLT, tokens could seamlessly move funds and “help in answering market’s demands,” Beau said.      Banque de France has been one of the most outspoken advocates for DLT. In October it began searching for a blockchain analyst to help it design a digital currency implementation program. And it was the first central bank in the world to develop a blockchain registry system, according to Beau.      “As a major provider of critical wholesale clearing and settlement services in euro, [the Eurozone] should be open to experimenting these innovations in order to revisit and possibly improve the conditions under which we make available central bank money as a settlement asset,” Beau said last week.      “We, at the Banque de France, are therefore quite open for experiments in that direction, together with the European Central Bank (ECB) and other central banks of the Eurosystem, in particular with regard to a wholesale CBDC,"" he added.      The ECB may well be experimenting already. It named a new chief for its fintech-focused “Innovation Hub” in early November, issuing at the time a mandate that the hub “foster international collaboration among central banks on innovative financial technology.”      But the European Union’s presidency has been more hesitant. It shot down rumors earlier this month that it wanted to issue its own stablecoins, saying it was only interested in regulating them, not making its own.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2019/11/25/french-central-banker-advocates-for-blockchain-based-settlements-in-europe,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ccb1155b0df8a928a0a85afd452878b707c09e39-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42431182,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nTh,1574680703,Bear Breather? Bitcoin Looks Oversold After 50% Price Drop Since June,"View  BTC may have found a temporary bottom near $6,500 and could witness a bounce to $7,000, as the short-term charts are reporting seller exhaustion. Consolidation may then follow.  A violation at $6,500 would expose the next psychological support at $6,000.  Analysts see the current dip as a buying opportunity. The implied rise to back to $10,000 and above, however, will likely take some time.    Bitcoin is looking oversold, having lost half its value in the last five months.      The premier cryptocurrency by market value fell to a six-month low of $6,515 during the Asian trading hours and is currently trading at $6,880 on Bitstamp. That represents a 50.43 percent drop from the year-to-date high of $13,880 hit on June 26.      BTC has registered losses in all of the last four weeks and last week's 18.72 percent drop is the biggest 7-day decline in nearly two months.      The sell-off may now be set for a pause, with the 14-day relative strength index (RSI) flagging oversold conditions, as seen below.    Daily chart    The RSI is currently seen at 20.00, the lowest level since Sept. 26. In other words, the market appears to be at its most oversold for two months.      The below-30 reading on the RSI does not imply a bullish reversal is on the way, but rather describes a short-term price extreme – an overstretched move to the downside, typically followed by a temporary pause or minor bounce.      Seasoned traders would argue that in a strong bearish market, the indicator tends to stay oversold for a long time. While that's true, BTC has already erased 50 percent of the rally from the December 2018 low of $3,122 to the June 2019 high of $13,880.      Further, the intraday charts are backing up the RSI with signs of seller exhaustion.    4-hour chart          The classic ""long-legged doji"" seen on the 4-hour chart represents indecision in the market place. In this case, it's appeared following a sell-off from $10,350 to $6,500, meaning the indecision is predominantly among sellers.      A higher low (or bullish divergence) on the RSI is also pointing to bearish exhaustion.      As a result, a corrective bounce to $7,000 could be in the offing and will likely be followed by short-term consolidation around that level. Acceptance below $6,500 would expose $6,000 – a level that served as strong support in the five months to October 2018.    Weekly chart            Bitcoin is flirting with the lower edge of the falling channel seen above, currently at $6,710. The odds of that support holding ground and fueling a price bounce is strong with the daily RSI reporting oversold conditions.      The outlook as per the weekly chart would turn bullish if and when the falling channel ends with a high-volume breakout.      Note that despite the five-month price drop, cryptocurrency experts like Joseph Young are still optimistic about bitcoin's prospects.            Young believes a potential drop to $5,000 or even lower would be a long-term buying opportunity. Popular analyst Josh Rager also tweeted earlier today that he will keep buying regardless of the price.      Meanwhile, George McDonaugh, managing director and co-founder of publicly listed cryptocurrency and blockchain investment firm KR1, told CoinDesk that the cryptocurrency is still in the early stages of the bull market.      ""We essentially went from $5,000 dollars to $13,500 in 3 months and now, like the swing of a pendulum, the market wants to know where the bottom is again. In my opinion, we are in the early stages of a bull market, you'll see that the bottom this time around is much higher than $5,000. We will find higher lows all the way back to all-time highs,"" McDonaugh said.

Led by the Chinese central bank, five financial and technology authorities jointly published the Bluebook of Blockchain on Thursday, outlining illegal and fraudulent schemes in the blockchain industry.      Approximately 89 percent of blockchain firms in China – some 25,000 – might have tried to create and issue their own tokens, while only 4,000 are fully focused on blockchain applications, Yedong Zhu, president of the government-backed nonprofit Beijing Blockchain Application Association, said in an interview with Chinese state media CCTV at the report’s launch.      The most common crypto issuance process, the ICO, has been deemed illegal by the Chinese government after its 2017 crackdown. However, it still allows crypto mining operations and possession of crypto assets in the country.      The findings come amid the Chinese government’s most recent crackdown on barred financial operations related to ICOs and crypto trading. Major Chinese cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai, have rolled out inspection plans with a view to shutting down any remaining crypto exchanges.      The authorities have gone so far as to close any marketing firms that promote crypto companies and those that masqueraded as blockchain companies to launch ICOs.      According to the report, more than half of the 28,000 blockchain companies are based in the Guangdong province of southern China, next to the Chinese Silicon Valley Shenzhen, while the rest generally run their operations from Beijing and Shanghai.      “We need to make sure the blockchain firms that illegally raise funds and commit financial frauds are not included in the government blockchain support programs,” Zhu said      The report is one of the three “bluebooks” that guides Chinese authorities on how to regulate the emerging fintech industry.

42431194,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyN0nrh,1574672400,Waves and the Tricky Task of Being a Russian Crypto Brand,"What if your biggest client is your biggest reputation risk?  When Vostok, the enterprise branch of Waves, a blockchain startup, launched last year, it was proud to showcase its Russian connections.  It debuted with the news of a partnership with Rostec, a state-owned mega-corporation with ties to many hi-tech industries.  But the Russian links have been a double-edged sword. While the Rostec tie-up earns legitimacy at home, it complicates things abroad. Rostec was sanctioned by the U.S. in 2014 following Russia’s annexation of Crimea and the war in Ukraine.  “There were risks for promoting our brand on the West,” said CEO Sasha Ivanov in an interview.  So Waves decided to distance itself from Vostok’s brand — though not completely.  “We can’t totally separate from our Russian roots, even if they might impede the business a bit,” Ivanov said. “I think we should become the main blockchain tech advocate in Russia.”    Leaving 'East' for WEST    In July, Ivanov sold the Vostok brand to the investment firm GHP Group for an undisclosed amount. The team and the Vostok product, however, remained with Waves.  After the sale, Vostok (Russian for “East”) was renamed Waves Enterprise, and Waves and GHP decided to form a joint venture to develop the transportation blockchain together, sharing the profits 50/50, Ivanov said. GHP invested $3.8 million in the venture, according to Waves.  The new name is meant to distance the company from the Vostok brand, mostly because of its close affiliation with Rostec, Ivanov said. Vostok’s VST tokens, issued last year, were re-branded too, becoming WEST: Waves Enterprise System Token.  Registered in Switzerland, Waves is striving to become a key blockchain provider for the Russian state. Based in Moscow, in a large office in the middle of a hipster office cluster, Waves is walking a fine line between being friendly with Russia’s state-controlled corporations (many of which are sanctioned by the U.S. and Europe) and building a positive image for the global market.  Any business wanting to lead Russia’s blockchain effort necessarily has to talk to government bodies a lot and Waves has been expanding its work with the government-related structures. The company has recently secured partnerships with several entities linked to the Russian government.    Blockchain for elections    These include the Department of Information and Technologies in Moscow City Hall, which trialed the first blockchain voting system for elections to a Moscow legislative body.  About 450,000 Moscow residents could vote electronically during the September 8 municipal elections, though the experiment got some harsh reviews. French security researcher Pierrick Gaudry showed that the system could be hacked quite easily.  Ivanov said Waves found bugs in the system and the authors of the voting system made some patches as a result. However, the experiment didn't go as smoothly as planned.  “We found a lot of bugs in that system. It was weirdly designed and didn’t rule out data manipulation,” he said. Contacted by CoinDesk, the Department of Information and Technologies hadn’t commented on the Waves partnership by press time.  Even so, Ivanov sees a promising future for blockchain in election management.  “Blockchain can help the government communicate with the civil society. It’s a good marketing tool for the government. It’s hard to tell how much transparency it will bring, but definitely more than there is out there now,” he said.    Hyperledger challenge    Currently, Hyperledger is the leader in enterprise blockchain, both worldwide and in Russia. But Waves believes it can catch up. The Waves Enterprise product, built upon the public Waves blockchain as a ready-to-use, out-of-the-box option, is designed for clients that don’t want to hire their own development teams, Ivanov said.  Waves Enterprise, together with GHP Group’s subsidiary FESCO Transportation Group, is now in talks with the major players of the logistics market in Russia, starting with the railroad monopoly The Russian Railways, or RZD, which has already been testing a solution by Hyperledger to track the production of train car wheels. RZD didn't respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  One way Waves is trying to differentiate itself from Hyperledger is to get the Waves Enterprise cryptography certified with the Russian Federal Security Service, or FSB. Such certification is necessary for working with government bodies in Russia but it is a long and costly process.  So far, only one enterprise blockchain system in Russia has passed the certification process: Masterchain, a system for banks. Waves hopes to complete certification by the end of this winter. The process, overseen by FSB-approved personnel and designed to ensure software has no hidden features, costs companies up to $100,000, Ivanov said.    Not like China    Waves worked with Rostec to develop a roadmap for blockchain development in Russia. According to the document, cited by the Russian media outlets when it was published last May, most government IT systems should be put on the blockchain, which will require about $1 billion of investment.  The document was not greeted with universal approval, Ivanov said. “The roadmap apparently didn’t meet the government’s expectations, and the government didn’t realize why [it needed to] use the blockchain tech. We’ll make another attempt.”  There will probably be more opportunities to take advantage of the government’s ambitious blockchain plans. Its nearly $28 billion Digital Economy initiative aims to improve broadband coverage and increase the use of home-grown software in government bodies.  Blockchain can be both a liberating technology as well as a tool for surveillance and greater control. In recent years, Russia, like China, has curbed the free online realm in favor of a managed system. In 2017, it attempted to block the encrypted Telegram messenger (the attempt failed) and the Russian parliament recently passed a law to create a “sovereign internet” — an internet segmented away from the global commons.  But Ivanov does not sound too worried. He thinks Russian internet users will continue to find ways around government censorship.  “The things that China is doing, they are kind of dying here. Or they turn into a farce.”  Edit (10:02 UTC, Nov. 25, 2019): Amended quote from Ivanov regarding Moscow voting system and corrected description of the deal with GHP Group.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Anna Baydakova,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2019/11/25/waves-and-the-tricky-task-of-being-a-russian-crypto-brand,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/4f81e9bd9f31222df80e957c884c27893a1f7fbc-2560x1920.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world’s largest cryptocurrency by market value dropped beneath its temporary supports near the $7,000 price level at around 22:46 UTC (5:46 p.m. New York time) on Nov. 24 and is currently changing hands for $6,924, according to CoinDesk’s bitcoin price index.  The plunge in crypto comes at a time when traditional markets cooled slightly by Nov. 22’s close, likely due to sentiment surrounding the rhetoric from the U.S national security adviser, Robert O’Brien, who warned that President Trump would not turn a blind eye to Hong Kong’s ongoing crisis.  This would likely complicate efforts by Washington and Beijing to put an end to the prolonged trade war currently underpinning global economic growth forecasts.  As a result traditional markets have flatlined with the S&P 500 index finishing a meager 0.2 percent up, to 3110.29.
