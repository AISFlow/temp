42397873,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQSk,1408302334,Wallet Service Integrates Bitcoin Payments with Social Networking,"A new Japan-based wallet service called 'Ninki' aims to be a social network for payments, where users build trusted groups who may need to transact on a regular basis or for a common cause.  Local charity events, crowdfunding campaigns, small- to medium-sized businesses and international freelancers are among the most likely kinds of user groups, said the company's lead developer, Benjamin Smith. Users can form groups and share details as easily as they can on popular social networks.  Smith told CoinDesk the aim is to streamline bitcoin payments between transacting parties.  ""The idea initially came from seeing how difficult it was for people to exchange and scan QR codes, copy and paste addresses, etc. Even for my tech friends. People get lazy and use the same address all the time.""  What makes Ninki stand out from other bitcoin wallets is its Contacts list, where users can categorize their contacts depending on their transaction needs.  Ninki, which means 'popular' in Japanese, has undergone extensive alpha testing over the past few months and opened in beta to the public last week.  Testing the beta: signing up and finding others  Registering a new account with Ninki generates quite a few keys and codes, so get ready to take secure notes.  The software generates a public user name and a 15-word public phrase. These are for others to identify you within the network and so you can perform a secure out-of-bound validation of the user.  At the user dashboard level Ninki's interface is in plain language and straightforward, with all the encryption and security handled seamlessly in the background.  You can search for other users by username and avatar, adding and approving them as desired. For one-off payments, you can also send to a standard bitcoin address.  Making connections and payments  To start building a trust network, simply share your 15-word public phrase with another user. Upon accepting, the other party will also share its phrase.  In the background, Ninki performs an exchange of public PGP (pretty good privacy) keys between the two users.  The user dashboard is simple and supplies all information regarding balances, contacts, groups and pending payments.  Users can easily send, receive and pay invoices from a Ninki wallet, individually or all at once. Each invoice is marked with a date and order ID number. Users may also reject invoices and check the status and details of payments on the blockchain.  A PGP-encrypted messaging feature keeps communications between users private.  Smith said security and privacy are priorities at Ninki, especially given the levels of public mistrust in the security and privacy levels of 'everyday' social networks.  Users can only see lists of members in networks they create themselves. And while it is possible to add an entire group to a trust network, the user will only see the name of the group itself and not its members.  In addition, users can set payment limits by day, per transaction or by number of transactions per day to prevent losses through error.  Security and identity features  Unlike other social networks, however, Ninki aims to protect users' private information rather than release or sell it to marketers.  Ninki is not just a wallet service. It is designed to be as secure as possible, with hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets as specified in the Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 32 (BIP32).  This means that a number of wallets can be generated from one 'master key pair' (MKP). Any number of 'child' wallets can be created from the MKP and used independently, but the owner of the master key retains control over all of them.  Public keys generated on assigned nodes by the public part of the MKP can be shared between members of Ninki. The users exchange Ninki phrases and verify them using an outside method of communication, like email, instant message or a face-to-face exchange.  Multi-signature wallets  Ninki's wallets are also integrated with multi-signature technology, two of three possible keys are required for any party to access the funds. Addresses are generated from the master keys for each transaction and never re-used.  Ninki holds one key; the user another. A third key is provided for users to keep in a safe place or with a trusted third party. This means funds may still be recovered even if Ninki were to disappear.  Smith added that in addition to alpha testing, Ninki would also be audited by 3rd parties including security experts and hackers. He said:  ""Getting cryptography and security right is difficult.""  The greater the number and variety of external checkers, he concluded, the more certainty the security model will be tight.

42397863,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQHv,1408291814,Should Bitcoin Users Trust Hosted Wallets?,"In bitcoin's early days, there were not many options for storing coins: users had to download the Bitcoin-QT client to keep the cryptocurrency.  That way, the platform storing the wallet provided as much security as the user required, with the option of keeping the client offline and encrypted – away from prying eyes searching for private keys.  In the past few years, though, bitcoin has moved off the PC desktop onto web services and mobile wallets. And many of these hosted wallets, as they are called, are managed by a third party.  Users relying on hosted wallets are, in essence, depending on third-party trust to safeguard their coins. However, hosted wallets are not created equal. So users must ask the question: can I trust a particular provider to properly store my bitcoin?  Will O’Brien, CEO of wallet technology provider BitGo, told CoinDesk:  “Ultimately, as bitcoin gains adoption, consumers will trust a wallet provider to be a custodian of their funds. But that trust should not be blind faith.”  Shattered expectations  One of the reasons there is a healthy dose of skepticism in the bitcoin community towards hosted wallets is because of past breakdowns in trust from some providers.  Mt. Gox  is an obvious case in point, where its slow decline eventually meant users could not withdraw bitcoin from their wallets, followed by the exchange’s total collapse in February 2014 and the loss of those trapped funds.  In another example, last year, wallet service Inputs.io suffered an attack where hackers stole $1.2m from users.  Kent Liu, co-founder of Purse.io, said:  “I've heard users say, ‘Hey, I rather trust – insert company – than to trust myself with securing my BTC’. After all, that's exactly what banks do with our dollars, and no one complains about that.""  However, he believes that cases like Mt. Gox provide good reason for users to take care when placing trust in hosted wallets.  “If a user chooses a hosted wallet, he [or she] essentially transfers the security liability to the service provider,” he said. “The two major vulnerabilities are hacking – since centralized wallets are more desirable to hack ­– and theft/negligence of the wallet service.”  To the next level  The good news is that there are companies pushing bitcoin wallet technologies to the next level, fostering a rethink about what a wallet really is.  “With multi-signature, the wallet keys can be distributed across multiple institutions so you don't have one single point of failure,” said O’Brien.  BitGo, in particular, recently raised $12m from investors to develop multi-signature technology for wallets. This improves both key control and security – something that bitcoin users in the future might demand from hosted wallet providers.  The business model for BitGo is to focus on providing enhanced wallet security and provisioning options, selling that technology as a product to other companies looking for powerful and secure wallets.  Growing choice  Today, there's an array of wallet options to choose from. The Bitcoin.org website, for example, offers recommendations for different platforms.  People are no longer tied to the original QT desktop client by any measure. While that is liberating and enabling, though, it also brings important decisions that a user must make.  One thing people should consider when choosing a wallet is whether or not they want control of their bitcoin address’s private keys.  This decision could also depend on what specific use the wallet is destined for: is it for regular spending, or primarily for saving?  “We use a system similar to Coinbase: small hosted wallet, large cold wallet – Purse is considered a ‘fast’ spending wallet,” said Purse.io co-founder Liu. His startup allows people to purchase bitcoin through Amazon buyers, and simultaneously allows its users to spend BTC on the e-commerce giant at a discount.  Liu added that an online, or 'hot', wallet is ideal for situations where transactions are constantly moving around. Many companies use this internally to ensure enough freely available bitcoin for quick transactions, while keeping the majority of their funds stored in a safer 'cold', or offline, wallet.  Cold wallets could be considered similar to a traditional bank's fiat savings account, while hot wallets are the checking (or current) account.  Private keys are key  Going forward, control of the private keys might be most important users' wallet security – no matter if it is hosted or not.  “Every user can protect their coins using public key cryptography and initiate transactions by signing with private keys only they control,” say Johann Barbie, a co-founder of SMS-based wallet provider 37Coins.  In fact, it may a slight distortion to call 37Coins a wallet company – at least when Barbie explains exactly what the company does:  “We provide a service that secures wallet transactions through multi-signature and second-factor verification. One key is kept with the partner, one key with 37coins and a third one with a legal entity for backup.”  That sounds like an ideal wallet situation, one many experienced bitcoin users might appreciate. Problem is, most new bitcoiners are not fully up to speed on bitcoin wallet technology.  In those cases, users won’t care if they don’t have control over their keys, or if transactions are being done on- or off-block chain, which is in and of itself a contentious subject for some.  Jaron Lukasiewicz, CEO of New York-based bitcoin exchange Coinsetter, says that his company has built in-house wallet tech for cold storage and manual withdrawal reviews, among other security measures.  He believes in the importance of users finding the wallet solution that best suits them. Consumer-facing solutions might just be good enough to get started, for example. But those trying to protect larger amounts of bitcoin need to do their research, or at least find someone to investigate the right option for them.  “Every wallet provider is different, and the best way to understand which is suitable for one's needs is to read documentation released by the provider and to understand the technology behind it,” Lukasiewicz said.  He added that, ultimately:  “Trust is created when the wallet's technology is matched by the people running it.”  Bitcoin technology image via Shutterstock",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Daniel Cawrey,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/17/should-bitcoin-users-trust-hosted-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/fff5761bac02c72ae7e92fdbf4d56fa98bd72cef-1644x1086.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397857,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQFx,1408283126,Fold's Scannable Barcode App Aims to Streamline Bitcoin Payments,"A new mobile bitcoin payments app is seeking to present digital currency consumers with a convenient, all-purpose spending solution.  Fold  , the latest effort from the makers of Coin For Coffee and Card for Coin, enables consumers to make bitcoin payments using a mobile app that can integrate with a variety of point-of-sale (POS) systems.  Like its creators' previous products, Fold allows consumers to spend bitcoin by producing scannable barcodes that resemble those on traditional gift cards. While Coin For Coffee focused exclusively on Starbucks locations, Fold will support purchases at US retail giant Target, as well as the popular coffee seller.  CoinDesk spoke with Card For Coin co-founder and CEO Matt Luongo, whose team is currently on focused on preparing Fold for beta. He said that the project builds on the experiences – both positive and negative – gleaned during Coin For Coffee’s development and deployment:  “We learned with Coin For Coffee. We confirmed our hypothesis that people want to spend their bitcoin, which is fantastic, and so far, I think we’ve run through most of the strange situations you can get.”  Luongo added that communication with the major brands involved, most notably Starbucks, has been open and helpful to the broader developmental process.  Pitch for merchant payments  Like Coin For Coffee, Fold will function as a bitcoin wallet, allowing users to load funds onto the card and use them for purchases. By using a mobile app, Luongo said that Fold can sidestep problems associated with products like Xapo’s bitcoin debit card.  After the user selects how much bitcoin they want to spend, the app produces a barcode that is scanned at the register. Any leftover bitcoin is then sent back to the wallet for future use.  According to Luongo, conversations with Starbucks have advanced since the Coin For Coffee days. Notably, he claimed the popular coffee company reached out to Fold and demonstrated a desire to learn more about digital currency and Coin For Coffee’s experience thus far.  After initial launch, Fold intends to reach out to additional merchants who may be interested in integration by way of commonly used gift card technology.  Luongo said:  “There is a huge opportunity here to go after any merchant that uses similar gift card technology. Most of these merchants aren’t ready to tackle [bitcoin] yet, but they’re very interested to see what numbers we have and what issues we run into.”  Development moves forward  Looking ahead, Luongo sees a public beta in the near future. Currently, prospective users are invited to sign up for updates, and in time, the Fold team will begin sending out invitations.  Luongo cited enthusiasm among the project’s fan base, as well as carry-over users from the Coin For Coffee project, as key factors that could propel Fold forward on launch. He said that this support is key to the project’s success, noting that several hundred individuals have already signed up to receive information.  Additionally, a recent resurgence of interest in Coin For Coffee has netted the project a new influx of supporters, individuals that Luongo expects will take part in any beta test.  When asked about the future of the bitcoin payments infrastructure and whether debit cards or mobile apps will be the top choice, Luongo said that the use cases are fundamentally different. However, he acknowledged the problems experienced by Xapo and said that mobile-oriented methods are, in his opinion, the stronger of the two:  “Ultimately, I think that gift cards and mobile are a lot more akin to cryptocurrency than these old card-based systems.”  Image via Fold",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY,Stan Higgins,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2014/08/17/folds-scannable-barcode-app-aims-to-streamline-bitcoin-payments,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5e49d0b99d9b2216a901abe81b3f68ec207f04fa-1260x484.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42397867,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbEQMq,1408270808,Alternative Pin-Up Site SuicideGirls Accepts Bitcoin for Memberships,"""The most dangerous global sorority of beautiful pin-up girls that has ever existed"" is now accepting bitcoin for its membership subscriptions.  SuicideGirls  is a popular adult-themed online community that bills itself as a celebration of alternative lifestyles and female empowerment.  Some 2,624 SuicideGirls provide photos, video and blog posts to the website. Further, the larger SuicideGirls brand has expanded from photography and video to include comic books, magazines and books since its launch in 2001.  SuicideGirls first broke the news it would accept bitcoin on Reddit in a post detailing its excitement about adding the payment option. The post played off positive remarks issued by the group's co-founder Missy Suicide in the company's formal press announcement, a sentiment she echoed in an interview with CoinDesk.  Missy said:  ""SuicideGirls was born on the Internet in 2001 and we have always been an enthusiastic adopter of new technologies and advancements that come from the web. [...] Bitcoin is a currency born on the Internet, and we really wanted to support the Internet’s native currency.""  More to see  Missy indicated that accepting bitcoin for its memberships is just the first step in what could be a larger move by the brand to accept digital currency. Missy said SuicideGirls is working to next accept bitcoin at its online store, and it hopes to take bitcoin for ticket sales at its live burlesque tour this fall.  Memberships cost the bitcoin equivalent of $48 for one year, $75 for two years and $200 for five years, and provide access to exclusive photos, videos, online groups and community events. The company accepts bitcoin payments through merchant processing provider BitPay.  Bitcoin interest  Missy said SuicideGirls has long been interested in developments in the bitcoin space, and that she personally learned about the technology through her personal relationship with noted bitcoin investor and Bitcoin Foundation board member Brock Pierce.  Missy said she worked with Pierce previously and was encouraged to learn more about the technology due to his own enthusiasm for digital currency.  However, she suggested that her company's larger overhaul of its website slowed its ability to add bitcoin payments.  She explained:  ""It took us a while to accept bitcoin on our site, mostly because we have spent the last two years rebuilding the site from the ground up responsively and that was just a huge project. It took up all our resources.""  Ideological partners  Though not an adult entertainment site in the traditional sense, the announcement is the latest that suggests adult-themed online communities and lifestyle groups are becoming some of the first major brands to accept bitcoin. For example, Hustler became one of the largest merchants to accept bitcoin this July.  Despite this business interest, Missy suggested that accepting bitcoin was a decision that was more ideological than practical, saying:  ""When bitcoin is the standard currency for the world one day, we want our early adopter bragging rights, you know? 2014 isn’t as early as we would have liked [to accept bitcoin], but at least we’re in [the ecosystem] now.""  In particular, she noted that bitcoin lacks a strong feature for rebilling, though she hopes bitcoin customers will become repeat buyers.  ""We figured we’d do one-off memberships and hopefully people would love being a part of our community so much they would go back into billing settings and buy another year when their first year expires,"" she said.  Subscribers switch to bitcoin  The bitcoin community comprises mainly males, but Missy indicated these demographics did not influence her decision to start accepting digital currency as most SuicideGirls members are women.  Further, Missy revealed the company hasn't seen a significant subscriber boost from accepting bitcoin, though she did not reveal exact figures.  Still, a number of customers, she said, are choosing to pay with bitcoin. For example, she mentioned that roughly 5% of the new members that enroll in the community daily are choosing to pay with bitcoin.  Missy said her company remains committed to bitcoin, even if it doesn't see a significant business gain from the move, concluding:  ""We’re not thinking short term about bitcoin. For us, it is about a long-term investment in a new kind of currency born on the internet that has a passionate community behind it.""
