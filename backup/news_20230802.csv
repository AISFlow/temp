What is this moving average being referenced, and what does it setting new highs potentially mean? The 50-month moving average at the highest point ever| BTCUSD on TradingView.com Meet The Moving Train: The 50-Month Moving Average As Bitcoin and the rest of the crypto market grind painfully sideways, a key measure using a moving average of BTCUSD price action is rising steadily, now at its highest point ever historically. The moving average in reference is the 50-month moving average (50MA). To calculate the span, simply take the last 50 months worth of BTCUSD closing prices, add them together, then divide them by the 50 (the number of months worth of data in the period). Related Reading: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Are The Tightest Ever, What Happens Next? Traders use moving averages for a variety of reasons. This includes as trend-following tool, as trend lines, and for timing entries and exits. Such signals trigger when price passes above or below the span, or if two moving averages crossover one another in a two-moving average system. These are called a golden cross or death cross. #Bitcoin’s 50-month moving average continues to set new record highs Without all the noise, the primary trend points upward pic.twitter.com/HG8gjO3Gn6 — Tony ""The Bull"" (@tonythebullBTC) August 2, 2023 What The 50MA Hitting ATHs Means For Bitcoin The 50-month moving average making new all-time highs, general means the primary trend is still up. The chart above shows the long-term uptrend clearly without the noise of candlesticks or price action. With the candlesticks turned back on, Bitcoin is above the span — another bullish sign.

42419840,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG2BB,1691017200,Is Sam Bankman-Fried Going to Jail?,"Federal prosecutors said they were “seeking detention” for Sam Bankman-Fried, asking a judge to revoke his bond after he shared documents with the New York Times that they allege were meant to harass a fellow executive from the FTX empire and potentially influence her testimony.  You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions.  ‘Astoundingly dumb’  The narrative  FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried appeared in court last week as prosecutors alleged he had “crossed a line” in sharing former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison’s private diary with the New York Times. The U.S. Department of Justice’s request is straightforward: It wants Bankman-Fried behind bars until his trial kicks off on Oct. 2.  Why it matters  We’re closely following Bankman-Fried’s journey through the U.S. legal system. Since his arrest, he’s been released on bond and able to live at his parents’ place. Prosecutors say he’s abused this privilege and should be detained until his trial, while his defense team says he has a First Amendment right to defend his reputation and respond to reporters.  Breaking it down  Last week, prosecutors told a federal judge they were “seeking detention” for Bankman-Fried. The defense objected that they had not been warned about the DOJ’s motion, and Judge Lewis Kaplan, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, ultimately chose to set a schedule for each party to file written submissions on the motion.  So the question remains: Will SBF go to jail ahead of his trial?  Prosecutors certainly hope so. The DOJ filed a letter Friday saying Bankman-Fried has now twice tried to interfere with witness testimony, saying he tried to tamper with general counsel at FTX.US in January before he “crossed a line” this month in sharing Ellison’s diary with the Times.  Mark Cohen, one of Bankman-Fried’s attorneys, said Bankman-Fried was merely asserting his First Amendment right to defend his reputation, adding that there have been a ""million"" negative articles about him and “thousands” of articles about his relationship with Ellison.  In a filing on Tuesday, he went further, alleging the DOJ had “mischaracterized” Bankman-Fried’s alleged witness tampering and taken facts out of context to disparage him..  One attorney with experience in white collar litigation, who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the case, told CoinDesk:  “The difficulty there is 'what is tampering,’” the attorney said. “I would look specifically at the evidence they're using and whether it can be viewed subjectively.”  The attorney said they would also expect another hearing on the issue, noting that Bankman-Fried could appeal any revocation of his bond.  Orlando Cosme, the founder and managing partner at law firm OC Advisory, said judges have a lot of discretion with issues like bond revocation.  “Generally people have free speech over what’s called protected speech. Intimidating witnesses is not protected speech,” he said.  Ken White, a founding partner at Brown White and Osborn LLP, told CoinDesk that the judge wouldn’t like a defendant trying to influence or retaliate against a witness.  “The question is how much the judge sees that as attempting to harass and influence a witness versus his lawyer saying [he’s just] putting his story out there and countering the media narrative about how terrible he is,” White said.  He said Bankman-Fried’s choice to speak to journalists and authors ahead of the trial is “astoundingly dumb.”  “He doesn’t know what’s bad and what isn’t,” he said. “... He really doesn’t understand the sort of theories behind the government’s charges and what admissions by him are harmful to him.”  The DOJ will have to be able to convince the judge that Bankman-Fried will continue harassing and intimidating witnesses or otherwise continue violating judicial orders to win its motion, White said.  Prosecutors have until tomorrow to respond to the defense filing.  One added wrinkle is that the DOJ announced it would drop one of the eight charges it brought, campaign finance, due to treaty obligations with the Bahamas.  The announcement spurred a lot of high-profile individuals to claim there was a conspiracy by elite politicians to protect Bankman-Fried.  Quite a bit of ink has been spilled calling this conspiracy theory dumb, but it’s absolutely worth spilling a little bit more to ensure these kinds of things don’t distract from what is looking to be a weeks-long trial beginning in early October that CoinDesk will cover every step of the way.  Cosme – who once interned with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York – said prosecutors are not the type to bend to political games.  While prosecutors may butt heads with the political appointees in their offices at times, typically if there's a serious disagreement the career prosecutors will resign if they feel uncomfortable, he said.  White said that the campaign finance charge isn’t worth potentially violating an extradition treaty, given all of the other charges Bankman-Fried still faces.  “People were saying … ‘well, you know, the government breaks various treaties all the time, why don't they just tell the Bahamas to pound sand?’ And the reason is, there's absolutely no reason to do it,” White said. “He's on the hook for fraud in the amount of billions of dollars. The guideline levels are basically an imaginary number, and campaign finance fraud charges are miniscule in comparison, they don't have any marginal additional weight. So it's like, the government's not gonna sweat it if they can't prosecute a parking ticket while charging murder one.”  Stories you may have missed  Don’t Pop the Champagne on U.S. Crypto Bills – Progress in Congress Has Been Costly: Jesse Hamilton looks at last week’s Committee passage of five crypto bills, and whether they'll make it to the White House. More on this below.  Judge Rejects Ripple Ruling Precedent in Denying Terraform Labs' Motion to Dismiss SEC Lawsuit: A federal judge disagreed with one of his colleagues on the applicability of the Howey Test on retail traders when rejecting a motion to dismiss.  U.S. SEC Sues Richard Heart, Hex, PulseChain on Unregistered Securities, Fraud Allegations: The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Richard Schueler (a.k.a. Richard Heart) and the Hex/Pulsechain ecosystem on securities and fraud charges.  Worldcoin Being Probed by French Privacy Regulator for ‘Questionable’ Practices: Worldcoin launched last week, and is now being looked at by everyone.  U.S.-Listed Crypto Firms Will Need to Report Cybersecurity Breaches: The SEC is requiring publicly-traded companies to be more proactive in detailing their cybersecurity plans.  Legislation advancing  Last week, the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees held three legislation markups, debating on and ultimately voting to advance five crypto-related bills: the Financial Innovation Technology for the 21st Century Act, the Blockchain Regulatory Clarity Act, the Keep Your Coins Act, the Financial Technology Protection Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023.  The question now is whether any of these bills will make it into law. Jesse Hamilton dug into the trials they'll face – and some of the issues they need to overcome – but for those of you who don’t spend your days immersed in the legislation section of the platform formerly known as Twitter, here’s what’s likely going to happen next:  The House is on recess through August. After lawmakers resume, their immediate focus may be on government funding bills. They could, in theory, attach one of the crypto bills to a “must-pass” bill like funding the government. If the House of Representatives votes to advance one or more pieces of crypto legislation to the Senate, the obvious question is whether the Senate will take it or them up.  So far, the answer doesn’t seem to be yes. The Senate Banking Committee has not indicated it will move on any crypto-specific legislation, let alone the full Senate. And, given House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.)’s assertion that the White House ended negotiations on the one piece of legislation widely seen to have bipartisan support – the stablecoin bill – it certainly doesn’t seem like President Joe Biden will sign any crypto bill just yet.  The Senate did include a provision addressing anti-money laundering rules in the National Defense Authorization Act, sponsored by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (R-N.Y.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kansas) that now goes to the House.  But a pair of court decisions across recent weeks may support the industry’s view that there needs to be greater legislative direction.  U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres, of the Southern District of New York, ruled earlier this month that Ripple did not violate federal securities laws through programmatic sales of XRP to retail customers. District Judge Jed Rakoff, of the same court, took a different view on whether such sales might violate federal securities laws when he rejected Terraform Labs’ motion to dismiss an SEC lawsuit.  There are important differences between the rulings – the Ripple ruling came after like two years of legal back-and-forth, the Terraform ruling is on a preliminary motion, etc. Nevertheless, the contradiction is likely to feed the industry viewpoint that there just isn’t enough clarity in the law right now to know whether securities laws apply to certain types of token sales.  Anyway: your move, Congress.  This week  Tuesday  15:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. EDT) There was a hearing in BlockFi’s ongoing bankruptcy case.  15:00 UTC (11:00 a.m. EDT) There was a hearing in Voyager’s ongoing bankruptcy case.  Wednesday  14:00 UTC (10:00 a.m. EDT) There will be a hearing in Genesis’ ongoing bankruptcy.

Elsewhere:  (The Wall Street Journal) I was really curious in the Congressional hearing on unidentified flying objects last week but it turns out one of the key witnesses never had any direct contact, and only said he knew 40 people who did? I’m disappointed.  (SEC) The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission published a statement last week saying that accounting firms which provide services for cryptocurrency companies may be held liable if the companies publish material misstatements “about the scope of work performed and the nature of the procedures followed.”  (Congressman Gus Bilirakis) Reps.

An overnight intervention by the Bank of Japan failed to stop the 10-year Japanese Government Bond yield from rising to a fresh nine-year high.  Cryptocurrency markets are selling off during U.S. morning hours Thursday, with the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) off 1.3%, led by a 1.3% decline in bitcoin (BTC) and near-5% drops for altcoins like Ripple's (XRP), Solana's (SOL), Cardano's (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE).  See more: Get professional-grade crypto data and news at CoinDeskMarkets.com  Fears of a continued surge in G7 interest rates are as good of an excuse as any for today's selloff. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) overnight was forced to step into the markets for the second time this week to try and arrest rising yields. The move may have helped somewhat, but didn't stop the yield on the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) from moving to about a nine-year high of 0.65%.  Yields are higher across Europe as well, and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is up 8.75% basis points to 4.175%, its highest level of 2023. Billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman overnight said he's short long-dated U.S. bonds ""in size,"" and that we could soon see more than another 100 basis point rise in yields.  In the U.K., the Bank of England (BOE), as expected, hiked its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to a 15-year high of 5.25%.  Rising rates are hitting traditional markets as well, with U.S. stock index futures showing declines of about 0.5% across the major averages, adding to yesterday's big selloff. Europe is down 0.8% at midday.  Larger moves ahead?  In an email to CoinDesk, Jeff Feng, co-founder of Sei Labs, noted the swirl of recent news, including multiple applications for spot bitcoin and ether ETFs, that are figuring in the crypto market's fluctuations and could lead to even larger price changes.  “We're seeing a multitude of influential factors at play, which includes corporate investments, regulatory advancements, macroeconomic shifts, and potential for increased accessibility through financial products like ETFs,"" Feng wrote.

KuCoin Urges Users To Backup Mining Records During the suspension, users will retain complete access and control over their assets, and all other KuCoin offerings will remain operational as usual. However, users who are involved in cryptocurrency mining are advised to transition their Bitcoin (BTC) and Litecoin (LTC) miners to alternative mining pools before the deadline to ensure uninterrupted earnings. KuCoin has also advised users to back up and preserve their mining records and associated data before August 27, 2023, as failure to migrate to alternative mining pools within the specified timeline could affect their mining revenue. Related Reading: Sell The News? Litecoin Traders Capitulate Ahead Of Today’s Halving Nevertheless, KuCoin Pool will not be held accountable for any potential earnings lapses resulting from users’ failure to migrate to alternative pools. The temporary suspension of KuCoin’s mining pools may cause some disruption in the crypto market, as mining plays an important role in the ecosystem. Despite this, it is worth noting that KuCoin is just one exchange, and its suspension may not have a significant impact on the overall market. KuCoin has assured its users that the suspension is temporary, and the company is working on a new strategy for its mining pool service. The company has also emphasized that the security and integrity of users’ assets remain its top priority, and it will take all necessary steps to ensure the safety of users’ funds. Litecoin Halving Triggers Price Drop Litecoin, one of the oldest and most popular cryptocurrencies, has completed its third block reward halving at a block height of 2,520,000, as reported by Colin Wu. The halving event has cut the mining reward in half, from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC, as part of the cryptocurrency’s deflationary monetary policy. The halving is a regular event that occurs approximately every four years and is designed to control the rate at which new coins are minted. By reducing the reward for mining new blocks, the halving helps to prevent inflation and maintain the scarcity of the cryptocurrency. The current price of Litecoin is $89.12, which represents a 3.8% decline over the past 24 hours and a 10% decline over the past six months. The price drop may be related to market uncertainty surrounding the halving event, as well as broader market conditions. Despite the short-term price decline, many analysts remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Litecoin and the cryptocurrency market as a whole. The halving event is seen as a positive development that highlights the ongoing maturation of the industry and the growing recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.

The halving event is expected to further strengthen Litecoin’s position as a leading cryptocurrency and contribute to its long-term growth and success. Overall, the completion of Litecoin’s third block reward halving is a significant milestone for the cryptocurrency and the broader industry. While short-term price volatility is to be expected, the long-term outlook for Litecoin and cryptocurrencies, in general, remains positive, with many experts predicting continued growth and adoption in the years to come.

Those five Wednesday transactions, totaling $3.7 million of ARKM, increased Wintermute’s position by more than 731%, according to blockchain analytics firm Nansen.  The Arkham Intel Exchange incentivizes people to figure out who is behind otherwise-anonymous crypto wallets, paying out bounties in the ARKM token. Wintermute’s accumulation of ARKM potentially makes them a bigger player in providing liquidity in that ecosystem.  “It’s super unlikely Wintermute is actually buying the token to hold it [as an investment].

Bitcoin and Ethereum, including most altcoins, have gone on recess while BNB surges amid rapid expansion plans on the Binance ecosystem. BNB’s spike on Tuesday, August 1, hinged on Binance’s announcement about the asset’s debut in the Japanese market through its newly launched subsidiary, Binance Japan. BNB jumped dramatically from $236.8555 to $246.0655, a nearly 4% increase, immediately after the news circulated the market. BNB Price Bullish Amid Japanese Debut It is noteworthy that BNB is launching on Binance Japan for the first time since the history of Binance. Moreover, Binance Japan is the only Japanese exchange offering the token on its platform. Therefore, venturing into a new market is like achieving a major milestone for BNB and could guarantee a wider user base and increased daily transactions for the token. Alongside the announcement for the launch of Binance Japan, Binance is offering spot and leverage crypto trading on 34 cryptocurrencies. This vast list potentially entails more transactions on Binance, leading to more BNB spending as the platform’s utility token. Related Reading: Sell The News? Litecoin Traders Capitulate Ahead Of Today’s Halving But surprisingly, the price increase is not reflected in BNB’s trading volume, down over 47% in a 24-hour period. CoinMarketCap data shows BNB recorded over $1 billion in trading volume toward the close of Monday’s trading session. The token saw an over 253% surge in trading volume on July 31, which didn’t reflect its nearly 1% price decline during the same period. After the sudden surge in trading activity and price, BNB’s movement has stalled as 24-hour trading volume stands at $734 million, with a 0.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. As of the time of writing, BNB trades at $242.9, inching closer to the $250 level as traders accumulate the token in anticipation of major rallies as it trades live on Binance Japan in the coming days. BNB Vies For More Rallies As It Prepares To Conquer Key Resistance Levels Binance Coin (BNB) trades above three key support levels: $240.4, $242.0, and $243.3. The bulls found strength at $242.0 and $243.3 price levels, facilitating the sharp spike to $246.065 in the early hours of August 1. The chart demonstrates heated strife between the bulls and the bears as they struggle to prevail over the market. However, the stiff resistance at the $246.5 price level allowed the sellers to trigger a trend reversal. The bears have formed bearish candle sticks above the $243.3 price level and are striving to press the token further below.

42419837,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG297,1691009464,Towards a Web3 Without Wallets,"Blockchain wallets are a core component of Web3. Wallets are key for user identity in Web3 and give users ownership of data and permissions in apps and smart contracts.  However, the combination of a steep learning curve and the high stakes of mistakes have been obstacles to mass adoption of Web3.  Users have been stuck with either custodial or self-custodial wallets. Custodial wallets are managed by a centralized third-party, which means reduced functionality and control for users. In contrast, self-custodial wallets put users in the driver’s seat but are complex to set up and operate. With self-custody, users must remember and protect a 12- or 24-word seed phrase to avoid losing access to their wallet.  Ben Turtel is the Founder & CEO of Kazm, a customer loyalty and community engagement platform for Web3. Previously he founded Rivet, an AI-powered reading app for kids, within Area120, and built applied machine learning solutions at Google.  The “wallet barrier” has significantly hindered onboarding of brands and consumers that are otherwise attracted to Web3. For Web3 to achieve mass adoption, the function of wallets needs to be reimagined such that users are barely aware that wallets exist - the same way Web2 apps don’t expose the UserId representing that user in an internal database. At the same time, user activity in Web3 should be decentralized, secure, and easy to manage without seed phrases.  A handful of emerging and converging technologies are already forming the foundation of this future. Over the next few years, the omnipresent role of wallets will recede into the background, and as a result, Web3 will offer simple onboarding and seamless integration across platforms.  The wallet barrier  In these early days of Web3, getting started with decentralized apps (dApps) typically requires having a wallet, which can be either self-custodial or hosted by a third-party custodian. While some hybrid options have been developed, users have generally faced a choice of two subpar wallet options with meaningful tradeoffs for convenience, security, access, and control.  A self-custodial wallet is often necessary to connect with and use specific dApps, including many crypto trading platforms, NFT marketplaces, and play-to-earn games. But setting up a wallet and seed phrase can be confusing and intimidating for people who are new to Web3. As a result, potential users often abandon the onboarding process.  Even when initial setup is successful, self-custodial wallet management still poses a host of challenges and inconveniences:  Remembering and protecting a seed phrase  Keeping track of an account identified only by a long string of numbers  Deciding whether to sign transactions, which are frequently difficult to understand or trust  Knowing how to connect to different blockchains and dApps  Finding on- and off-ramps for fiat currency  Having the right kind and amount of tokens to cover transaction (gas) fees  Following proper security measures in an environment with diverse hacking threats and frequent phishing attacks  While it’s easy to point out these issues in Web3, Web2 is also plagued by account management problems. Users juggle an ever-expanding list of logins and passwords, creating vulnerabilities for hackers to exploit, or they turn to centralized password managers that have also been subject to successful cyberattacks. And even when Web2 adds convenience, it comes at the expense of user privacy and control of their own data.  Converging solutions  Innovative technologies are opening up possibilities for moving beyond both account management problems in Web2 and the wallet barrier in early Web3.  These technologies involve dramatic improvements in the user experience of interacting with dApps on blockchains. At the same time, new approaches to identity verification and account interoperability are making it more secure and convenient to log into apps and services. A marriage of these technologies can help push wallets to the background and enhance functionality and security for users.  While these emerging technologies are still maturing, they can soon be expected to break down the wallet barrier and enable smooth, straightforward onboarding and engagement in Web3.  Smart contract wallets  Smart contract wallets are programmable accounts that operate on blockchains. They are a medium for interacting with a blockchain, and, because they can be programmed with detailed rules, they add a range of features and functionality not offered by standard wallets.  Simplified transactions: Smart contract wallets enable important functions like the bundling of transactions, paying gas fees with a wide range of tokens, and allowing dApps or brands to pay transaction fees on a user’s behalf.  Private key recovery: These wallets allow users to set up systems to regain access if their seed phrase is lost or forgotten. For example, social recovery backs up segments of a private key among trusted friends or family members who can then authorize key restoration.  Security safeguards: With smart contract wallets, users can establish rules to protect against theft. For example, they can cap spending, set limits on total transactions, or create a whitelist of accepted addresses to interact with to prevent getting tricked by a fake page. Smart contract wallets can also show transaction simulations that let users preview the outcome of a transaction before executing it.  Smart contract wallets (see some examples below) are a building block to a more robust Web3 that avoids the pitfalls of both self-custodial and custodial wallets. They can simplify and automate transactions across dApps to make Web3 approachable to more than just power users. By providing tools for private key recovery, smart contract wallets also eliminate one of the main pain points in Web3 onboarding. While there are still barriers to widespread use of smart contract wallets, their adoption is increasing on layer-2 blockchains that run on top of Ethereum and offer lower-cost and faster transactions.  Importantly, smart contract wallets can be programmed to validate users based on flexible and customizable criteria. This introduces the potential for users to manage smart wallets through more user-friendly and familiar accounts, possibly decoupling user accounts from the wallets that trigger transactions. In the next few sections, we’ll see a few emerging identity mechanisms that could be used towards this purpose.  Decentralized Identifiers  Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) enable the verification of identifying information while keeping the actual data under cryptographic lock-and-key controlled by the user. For virtually any type of information, DIDs can provide a verifiable credential that can be authenticated through cryptographic signing.  But how do DIDs help pave the way for a “wallet-less” Web3?  In effect, a combination of smart contract configuration and DID verification can make the existing concept of the Web3 wallet obsolete. Instead of requiring that a specific wallet address initiate transactions, smart contracts can require that the transaction include verification from a user’s DID. When necessary, users can authenticate and initiate transactions via a simple interface without a tedious or confusing series of steps. Gas fees can either be paid for by dApps (especially with low gas fees on layer 2 blockchains) or bundled into a single price for users to authorize with one click.  Worldcoin  One example of a rapidly growing application of DIDs is Worldcoin and its World ID technology to prove digital identity. A World ID can be thought of as a type of passport in which different stamps represent credentials that verify specific pieces of information, such as age, address, or work or educational history. When needed, users can authorize the display of a stamp without revealing the whole passport.  Credentials can be configured to share data on a need-to-know basis. For example, a credential could prove a person is over 21 without having to show their actual age. Credentials can also authenticate whether a person has completed certain actions like voting or making a donation.  Read more: Jeff Wilser - The Untold Story of Worldcoin’s Launch: Inside the Orb  Although the initial Worldcoin rollout includes associated wallets for blockchain transactions, DIDs provide an ability to verify identity without the need for a seed phrase. As these technologies evolve, programming a smart contract to recognize an authenticated DID can allow users to securely access and interact with dApps without ever having to think about the ins-and-outs of a self-custodial or custodial wallet.  The contours of this approach are already in the works as Worldcoin has partnered with the authentication service Okta to make signing in with a World ID available for a huge range of apps and services. With World ID, authorization is controlled by smartphone and/or biometrics (iris scanning) to protect against fraud. Whether Worldcoin emerges as a preferred DID solution remains to be seen, but it represents an emerging field of technology that can enhance how users connect with blockchains.  Bluesky  Bluesky is a social blogging app built on the AT Protocol, a framework for the social web that prioritizes decentralization so that users have privacy, control, and portability of their data. A single user account is interoperable across different decentralized social networks on the AT Protocol without requiring seed phrases or separate logins.  Public usernames or handles on the AT Protocol are underpinned by DIDs for authentication. User data on Bluesky is stored with cryptographic protection in signed data repositories that are linked to a user’s DID. If a user decides to leave Bluesky and migrate to another social network, they can take their identity, data, and social connections with them.  Despite being accessible by invite only, Bluesky has reached over one million downloads, reflecting the appeal of a new model of the social web. Although not based on blockchains, Bluesky and the AT Protocol are a demonstration of how new technologies can give users the convenience of a single account that works across different apps while preserving decentralization, security, and data privacy.  Google Passkey  Google Passkey allows users to access their Google account and other online services without passwords. To make this possible, a cryptographic private key is stored on a phone or laptop, and a public key is kept in the cloud. Logging in requires authenticating the private key, which can be done by unlocking the linked phone or laptop, such as with fingerprint or face recognition.  The passkey replaces the username and password as a means of accessing accounts, eliminating a vulnerable attack surface for hackers. Smart contracts could be programmed to verify identity by storing a public key in the smart contract so that only the user with the passkey could authorize interactions with the blockchain. This would give non-technical users an intuitive and secure way of engaging with dApps without passwords or seed phrases.  Passkey is the result of a long-term development process involving Google, Apple, and Microsoft, which sets this technology up for large-scale adoption by users and online services. While the role of these major companies in passkey synchronization might seem contrary to the decentralization ethos of blockchain, for many users, the trade-off might be worth the ease of use and familiar security mechanisms.  Token-bound accounts  With token-bound accounts, any non-fungible token (NFT) can contain assets, such as other cryptocurrencies or tokens, allowing the NFT to function like a wallet. In this way, tokens are directly held within the NFT, so when the NFT is transferred, all the assets bound to it are transferred as well.  While detailed use cases are still largely in the works, token-bound accounts demonstrate the flexibility and diversity of on-chain resources. Token-bound accounts make it possible to compartmentalize different decentralized assets in various ways, but at any time those assets can be controlled by the user whose credentials prove ownership of the NFT itself.  Unlocking Web3 without wallets  As smart contract wallets, DIDs, and other verification and login technologies mature, the wallet as we know it will move from front-and-center in Web3 onboarding to something that is abstracted away from the core user experience.  In a world of mass adoption of Web3, there is no reason that the average user needs to be thinking about blockchains or wallets. After all, Web2 is built on complex databases that users log into with a known method like their email or social media account. Yet virtually no users are aware of or concerned about the underlying mechanics of the database or sign-in process.  In the same way, wallets and blockchains can enable dApps but fade into the background for users, enabling key features critical to mainstream usage:  Simplicity: Users can sign in with familiar methods underpinned by robust security  Ownership: Users own and control their blockchain-based accounts to protect their privacy, but dApps can send rewards or assets directly to those accounts  Interoperability: Users can easily manage assets across an open ecosystem of token-enabled tools.  There may always be a subset of users that continue to use and manage wallets directly, but most future users in Web3 won’t need or want to micromanage thousands of high-value crypto trades. For the most compelling Web3 use cases, such as customer loyalty programs for brands, to take off, we need to removethe wallet barrier and simplify the UX.  For example, brands can build loyalty programs on-chain to create interoperable memberships, powerful rewards and unique collaborations for their customers, at the same time, they can leverage smart contract wallets to streamline onboarding, including by covering transaction costs at sign-up. Brands win by innovating and growing their loyalty programs, and users win by receiving perks without ever having to know that they are interacting with a blockchain.  A brand like Nike, for example, could reward a customer for a purchase by dropping a virtual shoe NFT to a familiar user account. With that same account, a user can wear that shoe in a metaverse of their choice, use the NFT to get access to an event or discount, or sell the shoe on a market like OpenSea – all without managing a wallet or seed phrase. This example just scratches the surface of the type of multi-faceted and user-empowering experiences that can be powered by Web3.  For Web3 to go mainstream, wallets should be as invisible to users as databases are in Web2. Converging technologies can push wallets to the background and make accessing and engaging with Web3 safer and more convenient. Capitalizing on those technologies can open the doors to mass adoption and a new era for Web3.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | WLD,Ben Turtel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/02/towards-a-web3-without-wallets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ba4e49f5f6e9ffa631b0139b393b47591f7621b1-3763x2520.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

In prior years, the token’s price peaked roughly a month before the halving event, then declined for months afterward.  Litecoin (LTC) plunged to its lowest price in a month Wednesday afternoon shortly after undergoing its anticipated ""halving"" event.  The native token of the Litecoin blockchain sunk to as low as $86, a level not seen since June 30, according to CoinDesk price data.  The coin is down roughly 6% during the day, underperforming bitcoin (BTC) and the broader crypto market represented by the CoinDesk Market Index, down 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively.  The decline followed Litecoin’s third halving in its history since 2011. The event happens roughly every four years – similar to Bitcoin halvings – and cuts the rewards for miners in half, curbing the issuance of new tokens. In crypto circles, LTC is often referred to as digital silver, akin to BTC’s digital gold nickname.  However, LTC’s price performance of around halvings differs from BTC’s behavior. Whereas bitcoin has tended to move higher following halvings, the past two occasions for litecoin has seen that crypto peak prior to the event and then sliding lower for months afterward.  “Litecoin’s halving cycle has been one of anticipation, where it troughs and peaks ahead of its halving event,"" Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at digital asset investment firm NYDIG, wrote in a report last week. “This is opposed to bitcoin, which has peaked well after its halving in its cycles.”  In prior halving years, LTC hit a top about four to six weeks ahead of the event, then declined into the halving and found a bottom after, Cipolaro explained.

In recent weeks, six companies have filed proposals with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to launch Ethereum futures ETFs. The Race To Launch An Ethereum Futures ETF Cryptocurrency ETFs track the price of the digital currencies they are tied to and they are not a new thing in the crypto industry. Bitcoin futures have gained popularity in recent years and are already being offered by popular investment companies. However, with bitcoin futures ETFs now established, it is only natural for the next hot product to be an Ethereum futures ETF. So far, more than 10 Ethereum futures ETFs have been filed in the past, but none have been approved by the SEC.

Now, Grayscale Investments is also looking to join the pack with its new Ethereum Futures ETF filing. After withdrawing its filing earlier due to SEC concerns, the digital currency asset management company is now back with a better application. Bitwise, another crypto index fund manager, also withdrew its previous filing at the same time. ETH price jumps to $1,839 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com According to the filing, the majority of the Grayscale Investments fund’s assets would be placed in Ether futures contracts with “front-month” maturities, which have “the shortest time to maturity.” The company also intends to diversify into other Ethereum contracts in the coming future. Why Ethereum Futures ETFs Are Gaining Traction The buzz around crypto ETFs was recently ignited by the news of BlackRock and other investment companies filing applications with the SEC for Spot Bitcoin ETFs. However, the SEC is still yet to give the go-ahead, citing failure to meet anti-fraud and investor protection standards in past applications. Analysts report that BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF could unlock $30 trillion worth of wealth. Of course, there’s no guarantee if or when they may get the green light. Related Reading: Here’s The Total Number Of XRP That Ripple Currently Holds For crypto investors and the industry, an Ethereum futures ETF would no doubt be a game changer.

As for ETH’s spot price, it has been struggling to break above $2,000 this year. At the time of writing, ETH is trading at $1,843.96.

42419828,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG20r,1691005789,Has the Bear Market Called Crypto's Bluff?,"When crises decimate an economy, governments try to look like they are doing something about it. The Great Depression spurred the New Deal, which included both banking regulations and a basic poverty-reducing safety net. The Great Recession brought about far less after millions lost their homes, but Congress could at least pretend that it passed necessary financial reforms.  But when the crypto economy collapsed over the past couple of years, with stablecoins losing their peg and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) revealing themselves as worthless jpegs, what did the ecosystem learn?  Nathan Schneider is professor of media studies at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he directs the Media Enterprise Design Lab. He is also the organizer of Exit to Community, the Metagovernance Project and Start.coop. This essay is based on a X thread here.  Stuff fell apart, and people got hurt. But crypto leaders didn't take responsibility. Instead, they turned to governments to clean up the mess with lawsuits and prosecutions, while also demanding favorable regulations. Unsurprisingly, especially after getting caught playing footsie with Sam Bankman-Fried, lawmakers have not been buying it.  The past year has called crypto's bluff, at least on the claim that this tech would be the basis of a better, fairer, more just financial system. As legions of newcomers saw their tokens become worthless, the protocol designers offered little consolation that this wouldn't happen again.  What makes me most hopeful about crypto is its capacity to enable more creative and democratic kinds of governance for online life  Many people have concluded, with good reason, that maybe crypto really is just about evading the law to do shady stuff. I cannot yet tell my relative who lost his house in the past year's crash that anything has changed.  What if the response had been different? What if crypto-world had tried to build infrastructure that is actually worth trusting? It still can. Protocol design is policy-making, and protocols can be designed with better policy. Being decentralized does not free an economic infrastructure from the need to be trustworthy and safe.  Allow me to paint a picture of what a serious response to the crypto collapse would look like. There are projects out there exploring each of these things—but none of them have reached the level of confidence-inducing, systemic change.  Protect users  During the Terra-Luna collapse in 2022, Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin suggested something like deposit insurance for crypto protocols. This and similar protections should be obvious. Average participants will not have much power in protocols through governance processes, so they should have confidence that the protocols will not rug-pull them. Protocols that don't include reasonable protections for users in their smart contracts should not be trusted.  Expect transparency  End the era of trusting crypto bros. Core protocols should require certain levels of transparency for contracts that run on them. FTX-style shadow transactions should not be possible for public services. In public stock markets, regular disclosures are required of all listed companies; the real-time data on crypto ledgers means that we should be able to expect more transparency from DeFi, not less. Privacy for users, but bright sunlight for public services.  Validate governance promises  What makes me most hopeful about crypto is its capacity to enable more creative and democratic kinds of governance for online life. But too often the promise of decentralized governance conflicts with the reality of projects that hand power to a few insiders with little accountability. Clear and decentralized governance should be expected for public apps—to ensure they walk the walk of democratizing talk. Systems should be transparent and audited.  Protocol design is policy-making, and each new protocol is a chance to make better policies    An organization I help lead, the Metagovernance Project, is working to enable this for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) with the DAOStar standards. But standards-setting should support, not inhibit, the kinds of governance innovation that sets crypto apart.  Embed adjudication  Before state courts get involved, participants should have a chance to bring their grievances before a well-designed, independent, decentralized court system. Tools like Kleros and Aragon Court show that such systems are possible, though there is still a lot of room for improvement. Nobody should trust a contract that doesn't include recourse.  Enable restitution  Despite using crypto wallets for almost a decade, just a few weeks ago I fell for a scam. Many times, I have made some kind of error on a transaction. Ledgers are immutable, but transactions need not be. Any contract worth trusting should be able to reverse transactions that can be proven erroneous or fraudulent. Reversible tokens exist and should be used far more widely, particularly for consumer applications. Combined with clear policies and adjudication, restitution is a requirement for any system that humans are expected to use.  Invest in collective power  There are already enough casinos for the wealthy in the fiat financial system. For crypto to be worth having, it needs to make good on the ambition of truly enabling more widespread access to ownership and economic power. Already, old-world investors have managed to co-opt most major crypto projects. To change that, it is necessary to intentionally design financial tools that enable ordinary people to access capital and participate fully. Techniques like quadratic funding point the way toward systems that privilege people over concentrated wealth.  Good governance needs more than startups  That is only a bare-bones list of what a mature, internet-native economy should include. Protocols could, for instance, include policies that protect a wide range of human rights and support ecological balance. What else would people in your life want to see to make a virtual economy trustworthy?  The story isn't over. The development of the layer-two ecosystem opens doors for a race to the top—toward infrastructure worthy of taking seriously. I can't emphasize this enough: Protocol design is policy-making, and each new protocol is a chance to make better policies.  I don't think, however, relying solely on markets and investor incentives will do the trick. Reliance on economics alone is a limitation on governance, as well as on design at every level.  See also: Tokenization Might Be a $5T Opportunity: Bernstein  If there is still promise in crypto, it means recognizing that the ecosystem is a commons, and it must be designed accordingly.

42419829,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG22v,1691005690,"Bitcoin Sees Little Boost From Fitch Downgrade, Slumps on Binance Contagion","Bitcoin falls on a report that DOJ officials have concerns about a run on exchanges in the event of criminal charges against Binance.  Prior to that story, cryptos had failed to see much of a boost from Fitch’s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on Tuesday evening.  Once strong positive correlations between bitcoin and the stocks have vanished and turned negative.  After failing to see a sustained bounce on the back of a downgrade to the U.S. credit rating by Fitch yesterday, bitcoin (BTC) tumbled into the red Wednesday afternoon following a Semafor report about U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials’ concerns regarding the possible fallout from charges against crypto exchange Binance.  Bitcoin fell more than 1% to below $29,000 in the minutes following the news hitting. A modest recovery since has brought the price back to $29,100, lower by 0.3% over the past 24 hours.  CoinDesk Market Indices (CMI) sectors reflected the downturn as well. The broad CMI is lower by 1%, with the Digitization Sector down by 2.3% and the DeFi sector off 3%. Performing best is the Computing Sector, down just 0.50%.  Traditional markets are down sharply following the Fitch downgrade, led by the Nasdaq’s 2.3% loss. Also at issue in tradfi is the continued strong employment picture, with this morning’s ADP jobs report for June showing 324,000 jobs added, nearly doubling economist forecasts. That’s helped send the 10-year Treasury yield higher by five basis points to 4.08%.  Key drivers of Fitch’s rating downgrade included expected fiscal deterioration, an increasing U.S. debt burden, and the “erosion of governance” relative to peers.  The news on Binance comes during a period when few factors have been able to move bitcoin’s price substantially. A look at BTC’s hourly chart shows that the troubled exchange’s potential charges changed that. Bitcoin fell sharply on higher than average volume, following the report. While prices have retraced slightly since, it’s been on lower volume totals.  Not surprisingly, Binance’s native token, BNB Coin, had an even more pronounced move downwards, falling as much as 4%, also on higher than average trading volume.  While cryptocurrencies and tradfi markets both wrestled with their own bearish catalysts, their movements with respect to each other continue to morph. What last year was a strong correlation between the two, at one point this year shifted to very little correlation, to currently an inverse correlation.  Correlation coefficients range between 1 and -1, with the former indicating a direct pricing relationship, and the latter implying an inverse relationship. BTC’s correlation with the S&P 500 has fallen to -0.70, while its correlation with the DJIA has dropped to -0.85. Also of particular note is bitcoin’s declining correlation with the U.S. dollar, down to -0.82 currently from 0.03 on July 23.  While the decline in correlations with TradFi is worth noting, it's worth remembering that the gauge can be quite volatile. The coefficient has ranged from as high as 0.91 to as low as -0.70 over the past year.",NEGATIVE,BTC | BNB,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/02/bitcoin-sees-little-boost-from-fitch-downgrade-slumps-on-binance-contagion,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8897ce42541d3167ef398a519dfacfdea6b7360c-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The token is now over 10% higher than seven days ago. Optimism’s gain has placed it among the top-gaining coins today, with a nearly 3% gain in the last 24 hours. Optimism Price Action As Bulls Struggle To Prevail According to CoinMarketCap data, Optimism peaked at $1.6712 on Wednesday morning, an over 5% increase from its past-day price. However, due to the intense struggle between the buyers and sellers, OP has receded from the day peak and is now traded at $1.63, with a 3.08% price increase. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is Shibarium The Key To A Trend Reversal? Optimism maintained a fairly bullish momentum from July 13 to August 2, reflected in its over 22% 30-day price increase. While the uncertainty about its next price action remains high, speculations suggest the following developments might influence the OP’s market outlook in the coming days. Optimism Could Face Backlash Due To The Recent BASE Exploit Coinbase’s newly launched BASE network built on the Optimism Stack reportedly witnessed a backdoor contract exploit, leading to the loss of 597 Ether worth approximately $1 million. According to on-chain investigations, the exploiters infiltrated a BASE Chain’s backdoor contract, continuously minted tokens, and sold them for profit. Data shows that the perpetrator address already minted 40 different tokens, generating approximately 597 Ether in profit, which has been moved out. Speculations are that the exploit might impact all protocols linked to it, including the Optimism network, since BASE anchors the OP Stack. Also, the BASE hype attracted several new crypto addresses to the Optimism network. The recent hack may depress investor sentiment, potentially impacting OP’s price. The number of active addresses on the Optimism network grew significantly over the last few months after BASE’s launch in late February. However, this growth could be stalled due to the unfortunate event on the BASE network. OP Price Outlook; Will the Bulls Sustain the Rally? The OP/USD daily chart demonstrates OP’s bullish momentum as the bulls fight to secure higher market positions for the coin. OP has surpassed its two critical support levels, and the bulls show no sign of stopping, evident in the short green candlesticks formed above the $1.631 support level. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence is above the signal line with green histogram bars that reflect the asset’s bullish momentum. In addition, the RSI has crossed the overbought region and now sits at 75, demonstrating increased buying pressure on OP. Related Reading: Here’s The Total Number Of XRP That Ripple Currently Holds However, a bearish trend reversal is possible since the buyers have reached saturation and may recede due to a decline in momentum. As of the time of writing, OP trades at $1.63. But the next few hours are critical as the price could decline to $1.61 if the bears reclaim control.

Federal prosecutors are concerned that indicting Binance could trigger a run on the exchange like the one FTX experienced when the DOJ filed criminal charges against its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, Semafor reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Such a run could lead to customers losing money, which in turn, could trigger panic in the crypto market. Other options, which could reduce that risk, include fines and deferred or non-prosecution agreements, the article said. In June, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued crypto exchange Binance and its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, for allegedly mishandling customer funds and secretly sending them to a separate entity controlled by Zhao. It's unusual that the DOJ would charge a company after the SEC. When both agencies are investigating wrongdoing at a company, they generally bring charges at the same time.

In the last few days, CRV has seen its value decline significantly due to the recent Curve Finance exploit on Sunday, which resulted in a total loss of over $60 million. According to data from CoinMarketCap, CRV is currently trading at $0.56, with an 8.28% loss in the last 24 hours. Abracadabra Exposed To Significant CRV Risk Levels In a governance proposal submitted on Aug 1, DAO contributor and community manager Romy highlighted that Abracadabra was currently exposed to a substantial level of CRV risk. To address this situation, the proposal contains a strategy that introduces collateral-based interest to both CRV cauldrons – lending markets – on Abracadabra. Related Reading: Ethereum DeFi Coins Plunge As Curve Concerns Threaten Major Market Crash Romy stated that Curve Finance, the underlying platform of CRV, has seen its TVL negatively affected over the last month by several events, including the Conic Finance Hack, the JPEG’d exploit, and the attack on Curve itself. In particular, Romy noted that the theft of $25 million from Curve’s CRV/ETH pool had impacted the on-chain liquidity for CRV, altering the conditions that led to the adoption of the token as a collateral asset on Abracadabra. In addition, the proposal also noted that Abracadabra had recorded CRV outflows toward markets with lower Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and higher interest rates. Together, all these factors have affected CRV’s price and liquidity, prompting the need for Abracadabra to reduce its exposure to the token. CRV trading at $0.558 on the daily chart: Source: CRVUSD chart on Tradingview.com Abracadabra’s Proposed Strategy To Introduce 200% Interest Hike As earlier stated, Romy’s governance proposal aims to cover Abracadabra CRV’s risk by applying collateral-based interest to the two CRV lending markets on the platform. It was stated that this strategy had been previously implemented with the WBTC and WETH cauldrons. This introduction of collateral-based interests would allow Abracadabra to levy interest directly on each CRV cauldron’s collateral which is directly transferred to the protocol’s treasury and converted to Abracardra’s native stablecoin MIM, either via on-chain or off-chain transactions. Related Reading: Is It A Good Idea To Buy Curve Now? Here’s What This Founder Thinks Based on projections, Romy stated that this strategy would allow Abracadabra to boost its treasury reserve and cut potential losses due to CRV exposure to about $5M borrowed MIM. Under the new proposed interest structure, the interest rates will be determined based on two factors: the combined outstanding principal of the CRV cauldrons and the collateral ratio of each cauldron. The base interest rate will vary depending on the total borrowed amount, classified into three ranges: $0M-$5M, $5M-$10M, and $10M-$18M. For instance, as the current outstanding principal stands at $18M, the base interest rate would be set at 200%. Using this rate, it is estimated that the loan would be completely covered in six months’ time. Furthermore, the collateral ratio would influence the interest multiplier, with ratios ranging from <= 40% to <= 70% correlating to multipliers of 1x, 5x, 10x, and 25x, respectively. According to the proposal, this interest rate structure ensures the maximum chances of “full principal recovery” for Abracadabra. The voting session for this proposal commenced on Aug. 1. and will run for only 46 hours due to the supposed urgency of the matter. As of the time of writing, 51 members of the Abracadabra DAO have placed their votes, with 99.74% supporting the proposal.

42419824,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG1zp,1690997783,Why I Don’t Feel Bad for HEX Founder Richard Heart’s Victims,"On Monday, July 31, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a series of civil charges against Richard Heart, born Richard Scheuler, the founder and relentless promoter of the related Hex, PulseChain and PulseX projects. The associated tokens, which have already been disemboweled by the continued dump after the disappointing launch of Pulsechain, dropped another 50% or more on the news.  The charges come after nearly five years of warnings from crypto watchers that these projects were scams – and the SEC agrees, including fraud amongst the allegations against Scheuler. Notably, that makes this a dramatically different situation than Ripple Labs’ legal battle with the SEC. That case is limited to the question of securities violations, which is why it has been seen as an important bellwether for the broader crypto industry.  This is an excerpt from The Node newsletter, a daily roundup of the most pivotal crypto news on CoinDesk and beyond. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  But the SEC claims that Richard Heart and his projects are simply frauds. While we haven’t yet seen any criminal charges from the U.S. Department of Justice, those might come later, as they did in the case of Terra founder Do Kwon. Because Richard Heart has clearly been up to no good.  Richard Heart flushed your money (and it all went down)  The most scandalous new claim made by the SEC is that Heart and his allies “recycled” investor funds during the initial presale of HEX, the earliest of the three projects, between 2019 and 2020. This recycling was done via the so-called “Hex Flush Address,” which receives various fees from Hex users, and also acted as a holding address for investor funds during the initial HEX sale.  The SEC alleges that Heart and associates moved funds from the Flush Address to a centralized exchange through a series of obscuring transactions. Heart then allegedly sent that money back to the Hex “Contract Address,” disguised as money from new investors.  This means, first, that actual investment in the Hex project was far lower than it appeared. The SEC claims that recycling constituted 94%-97% of supposed investments sent to the contract address. So instead of the equivalent of $678 million worth of ETH, the HEX presale actually attracted roughly $34 million worth of real investor funds.  As the SEC observes, this fund recycling helped Heart lie about the success of the sale, attracting more victims. It also left him in control of an overwhelming majority of HEX tokens.  (Some may note I’m talking about the HEX offering as a “presale.” Another of Heart’s manipulative rhetorical tactics was to describe it instead as a “sacrifice” somehow tied to freedom of speech. He specifically pitched this distinction-without-a-difference to victims as a way to avoid SEC scrutiny. But as the SEC says in the charges, it was simply a misdirection from the fact that the sale likely violated securities law.)  The recycling allegation is revelatory for a second reason. Who controlled the Flush Address has been hotly debated among Richard Heart’s critics, with Heart continually denying that he was the keyholder. But the SEC claims that this was indeed the case, and is what allowed him to fraudulently manipulate the initial offering.  Don’t fake the stake  The SEC has understandably attracted the ire of crypto advocates this year, but it’s still worth celebrating when somebody over there shows genuine understanding of how crypto works. The Richard Heart charges show this understanding when the SEC calls out Hex for what amounted to an entirely fake HEX “staking” program.  This is another way that Heart seemingly targeted the naïve. In a real proof-of-stake blockchain, staking an amount of tokens is required to become a block validator, or to delegate to a validator. A validator has responsibilities that can include building and confirming blocks. In many cases, this involves real technical skill and substantial work. But Hex’s “staking” program, the SEC makes clear, was not that.  Instead, staking offered high returns (also paid in HEX) simply for locking up a holders’ HEX for a long period of time. After all, for the first years of its existence, HEX didn’t even have its own chain to secure, so “staking” was a non-sequitur. Instead, as the SEC spells out, “staking” incentives were primarily intended to keep HEX tokens off the market. That is, like most purported “features” of HEX, it was meant to manipulate the token’s price higher – something Heart publicly discussed – rather than to actually accomplish anything technically useful or necessary.  See also: The PulseChain Sideshow Tent Is Collapsing | Opinioin  In short, Hex stakers got ripped off twice. Richard Heart sold them worthless tokens for real money – then convinced them to give the worthless tokens back in exchange for a smaller amount of worthless tokens, distributed over time.  Some stakers were even shaken down by yet a third gleefully exploitative design choice. Hex stakers could actually be penalized for not withdrawing their stake on time, and those penalty fees were among those that went to the Flush Address – that is, secretly, back into Richard Heart’s pocket.  ‘Number go up’ is not a business model  The SEC also notes that the Potemkin staking program’s advertised returns were not derived from fee revenue being generated on the chain. Notably, this was also the fundamental problem with Do Kwon’s Terra chain, which ultimately rested on subsidized and inflated returns through the Anchor Protocol.  That shared penchant for subsidies and money printing point to a broader parallel between Hex and Terra. They both had wildly flawed financial models that were reliant on leverage, lockups and cults of personality – and both were later credibly accused of being explicit frauds. This was one of the points made by the hosts of the “Crypto Critics Corner” podcast during our interview at Consensus: When something seems fishy on the surface, there’s probably even worse stuff going on under the hood.  Richard Heart also repeatedly said that the main goal of the project was to design an asset that only went up in price. Of course, what’s left unsaid here is that it’s not being designed for anything else. One former Hex investor, posting as @scottcbusiness on the Read.Cash platform, summed up the problem better than I possibly could:  “HEX uses a certificate of deposit in the form of staking to achieve a high interest return. This is considered to be the use case and utility of HEX. Considering staking is really a consensus model, I wouldn't really consider it a utility or use case … I don't consider staking itself as a product. For example, I can stake on Hive, but that's not a use case for Hive, the use case is blockchain integrated social media.”  In other words, no matter how much financial engineering you do, a token with no utility will have no actual organic demand and will eventually go to zero.  See also: 6 Kinds of Crypto Scams and How to Avoid Them  This is part of why it’s particularly hard to feel bad for Richard Heart’s victims. While all scams leverage victims’ greed, Heart targeted it like a sniper. His Gucci-draped image and unabashed focus on price meant he collected people who envisioned becoming rich, rather than people who thought critically about the technology or financial models they were buying into.  They’re getting the returns that mindset deserves: investors who bought in after the initial HEX presale have currently lost as much as 99% of their money.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING,David Z.

The consensus EPS estimate is -$0.62 (+29.10% Y/Y) and the consensus revenue estimate is $638.79M (-21.0% Y/Y). Over the last 2 years, COIN has beaten EPS estimates 63% of the time and revenue estimates 50% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 1 upward revision and 2 downward revisions. Revenue estimates have seen 5 upward revisions and 11 downward revisions. Past results : Q1 GAAP EPS of -$0.34 beats by $1.02, and revenue of $772.5M (-33.4% Y/Y) beats by $119.2M. The cryptocurrency exchange surpassed Wall Street earnings and revenue expectations for Q1 as expenses declined notably while revenue shot up during the quarter. Sentiment toward digital tokens soared in Q1 amid jitters surrounding the traditional banking sector, serving as a boon for COIN. News of interest : The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against the cryptocurrency exchange in June, alleging that it's operating as an unregistered securities broker. SEC had asked the company to halt trading in all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin. Wall Street analysts : ""We like the company's solid execution in Q1 with material cost-cutting and more focus on key parts of the business while being nicely profitable. We believe there should be follow-through momentum again in Q2, and we are upping our estimates here ahead of the print,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Joseph Vafi said. COIN also remains one of the most shorted names in the group despite recent short covering activity, which could catalyze a move in the event of better- than-expected results, Keybank Capital Markets said. Seeking Alpha analysts : The SEC's enforcement actions have impacted Coinbase's trade volume, which could lead to potential declines in Q2, SA contributor Mandela Amoussou said . Q2 results could show a drop in Bitcoin trading volumes, potentially leading to a sequential revenue decline. Analysts are predicting a sequential rise in quarterly revenues for Q3, but the risk of weak guidance remains, according to SA author Bill Maurer. Coinbase doesn't seem to have a solid path to profitability. All signs point to revenues decreasing over time. Bitcoin ETF filings are likely immaterial too, SA analyst Stony Chambers Asset Research said . Ratings : The sell-side analysts give the stock a Hold rating, with an average price target of $79.91.

Earlier this year, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued the company and founder and CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao for ""willful evasion"" of U.S. laws.

Bitcoin's price remains unaffected by the SEC's actions, continuing to rally and ""shake-off"" bearish news. Recent news of a summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs in the SEC's case against XRP brings a welcome change to the negative sentiment in the crypto space. Produced with Avi Gilburt and Ryan Wilday After a litany of bearish developments in the crypto space last year: The Terra Luna (LUNC-USD) crash, the Celsius (CEL-USD) crash, and the FTX (FTT-USD) collapse, the first half of 2023 concluded with similarly anti-crypto sentiments as the SEC announced the filing of charges against Coinbase for ""operating as an Unregistered Securities Exchange, Broker, and Clearing Agency."" Additionally, the SEC also announced the filing of charges against Binance for ""operating unregistered exchanges, broker-dealers, and clearing agencies; misrepresenting trading controls and oversight on the Binance.US platform; and the unregistered offer and sale of securities."" As noted in my most recent update from March, ""[w]hile these failures [FTX, Celsius, Terra] have demonstrated some of the risks of the larger crypto space, what is also apparent is Bitcoin's strength and stability in the face of adversity."" Similarly, the market seemed relatively unconcerned about these actions from the SEC. Please note the chart below and the red ""balloon"" where the news was announced. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) completed a small correction and started a new impulsive rally from the June low. BTCUSD Daily Chart (Jason Appel (Crypto Waves)) And, while the SEC's charges did not pertain to Bitcoin, the continued threat of regulatory action in the space is clearly not altogether inspiring wider adoption of crypto. The takeaway here is that Bitcoin's price continues to ""shake-off"" the bearish news. While our forte is not to predict the news, there's a real question as to whether the tide is turning on the news front. Two weeks ago, on July 13th, the announcement was made that, in the SEC's case against XRP, a summary judgment was made in favor of Ripple Labs, ruling that XRP is not a security. It should be noted, however, that this was not a complete victory, as the sales of XRP to institutional investors met the standard for the Howey Test, which is used to ascertain whether an investment is or is not a security. Nevertheless, this news is a welcome change from the negative tenor in the past year+. Let's take a look at the technical picture of the current stance. In the previous update, we noted that we tentatively considered the uptrend intact from the 2018 low, and while the November 2022 low briefly broke beneath ideal support, that its strong rebound and continuation higher in 2023 constitutes an overall successful test of support. On a smaller timescale, from the 2022 low, price has formed an uptrend in what appears to be a series of impulsive rallies and corrective declines. Based on the proportions among the individual waves, I've shifted the internal composition of my bullish perspective from the previous updates from a larger wave 1 of (5) forming, to a series of nested 1-2s that is getting near a larger breakout. (Reposting the chart from above for reference) BTCUSD Daily Chart (Jason Appel (Crypto Waves)) On the micro level, price has a good impulse up from the mid-June low and appears to be filling in a corrective retrace from the top. Fibonacci's support for upside follow-through in this count is $27.2k-$28.9k. So far, price has tested the upper end of this region but the corrective decline from the July high appears incomplete. Whether price intends to follow the black vs. purple path is still a larger and more significant question. We tentatively hold a bullish view for price to head to new all-time highs in this rally that's commenced from the 2022 low. However, even in the more bearish case presented in the purple count-the shorter timeframe of action is aligned within this perspective for a move up to $46k-$50k before a larger top is likely to be struck. That forecast portends approximately a 60% gain from current levels and even more from an entry in the noted support. Also, this setup is technically valid so long as Bitcoin's price remains above the June low. However, a sustained break below $26k would signal a likely failure. And while a breakdown below the June low still has some bullish potential later on into 2023 upon a successful retest of lower support, the immediate setup would be invalidated.",POSITIVE,BTC | XRP,BTC | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4622702-wheres-bitcoin-going-second-half-of-2023?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/15563617.jpeg

42419819,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG1uf,1690992161,Bitcoin ETF Approval Odds Just Got Better: Bloomberg Analysts,"ETF analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence raised their estimates for the launch of a U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) to 65% from 50%.  The analysts said the SEC's seeming approval of Coinbase’s bitcoin trading platform is one positive indication; another is SEC Chairman Gary Gensler downplaying his role in a recent interview.  ETF analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence raised their estimates for the approval and launch of at least one spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the U.S. this year.  “The odds of a spot Bitcoin ETF launching this year are up to 65%, in our eyes, after a flurry of developments,” analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas wrote. They previously assigned a 50% probability.  Several major institutions, among them BlackRock, Fidelity, WisdomTree and Valkyrie, have in recent months filed applications for a spot bitcoin ETF to make investing in bitcoin more accessible. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has in the past rejected such applications, many experts say there is a good chance that at least some of the applications will get approved, especially that of BlackRock, which has rarely been denied an ETF application in the past.  Contributing to the more optimistic outlook is an observation that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler downplayed his role at the agency in a recent interview with Bloomberg, emphasizing, when asked about crypto-related matters, that there are four other commissioners.  “The deflection seemed a change in the way he normally handles these topics,” the note said, pointing out that while there are five members, the chair has far more control and it would be unusual if the two other Democratic commissioners were to make a different decision. “We believe this may be a signal that aspects of the anti-crypto stance are becoming politically untenable for Gensler.”  Another positive development is the SEC’s seeming approval of Coinbase’s bitcoin trading platform, with CEO Brian Armstrong being told to delist all cryptocurrencies except bitcoin.  “This solidifies our view that if the SEC is going to bend anywhere on crypto ETFs, it will be with regard to bitcoin ETFs,” Seyffart and Balchanus wrote. Coinbase acts as the most prominent surveillance-sharing agreement partner and custodian in many of the current filings.  Lastly, the SEC’s case against crypto asset manager Grayscale could be a catalyst if the SEC loses in court, which Bloomberg expects to be the case. Grayscale, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group.  The SEC last year turned down the asset manager's request to convert the biggest bitcoin trust into an ETF, and Grayscale sued over that decision. If the asset manager wins the case, the easiest move for the SEC would be to approve all outstanding bitcoin ETF applications, the analysts said.  “One caveat to our line of thinking is Gensler’s oft-stated disdain for the current makeup of crypto trading markets,” the analysts wrote. Gensler has repeatedly stressed some of the negative aspects of crypto in the past, including fraud, manipulation and abuse.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/02/bloomberg-etf-analysts-raise-chance-of-spot-bitcoin-etf-approval-to-65,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d8d7972553621ce157e9c1b4d45809c493295e66-998x561.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
15562938,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545505,1690992008,"Bitcoin Funding Rates Most Positive Since Feb, Long Squeeze Soon?","Data shows that Bitcoin funding rates have risen to the greenest levels since February 2023, something that could increase the risk of a long squeeze. Bitcoin Funding Rates Are At Highest Levels Since February As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, longs have accumulated in the market recently. The “funding rates” is an indicator that keeps track of the periodic fee that traders on the futures market are exchanging between each other right now. Related Reading: Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators When the value of this metric is positive, it means that the long contract holders are currently paying a premium to the short holders so that they can hold onto their positions. This kind of trend implies that the majority of the market shares a bullish sentiment. On the other hand, the indicator being below the zero mark suggests the payments are flowing the opposite way: shorts are paying the longs. Naturally, here the bearish mentality is the dominant force. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin funding rates since the start of the year: The value of the metric seems to have been quite high in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin funding rates have surged during the past day as the cryptocurrency’s price has recovered back above the $29,000 level. The rise implies that new long positions have appeared on the market, and the gap between the shorts and longs has widened. Following this increase, the funding rates have hit highly positive levels not witnessed since back in February of this year. When the metric hit its high values back then, the cryptocurrency’s price had formed a local top and had started on a steep decline. The reason that the market reversed its trend even though the futures market traders were bullish was perhaps due to a long squeeze. A “squeeze” is an event where a sharp swing in the price sets off a high volume of liquidations at once. Such liquidations only end up providing further fuel for the price move, thus prolonging it and causing even more liquidations. As such, liquidations can be imagined to cascade during a squeeze. Whenever the futures market becomes overheated, the chances of this mass liquidation event taking place can go up. Generally, a squeeze is more probable to effect the side that has the larger amount of contracts. Naturally, this side would be reflected in the funding rates. Related Reading: Sell The News? Litecoin Traders Capitulate Ahead Of Today’s Halving As the indicator’s value is highly positive right now, a long squeeze could have reasonable chance of happening.

42419835,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG285,1690992000,Crypto Hedge Funds Will Shake Up the Industry: Crypto Long & Short,"It appears there are several hundred crypto hedge funds. PricewaterhouseCoopers counted more than 300 in 2022. And I expect the tally will rise amid an influx of institutional money. That growth will represent the industry’s next catalyzing event.  Each of those hedge funds will have its own unique story. What follows is just one of them.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A perk of my CoinDesk job is being able to speak with capital allocators – enjoying some access to the tip of the spear, so to speak, of institutional investment within the crypto landscape. Last week, I met with Jonathan Man, chief investment officer at Valmar Capital, an emerging U.S. cryptocurrency hedge fund. The company focuses on uncorrelated returns while implementing a multi-strategy, absolute-return approach.  The total breadth of our conversation can’t be captured in one article, nor will the depth of crypto-fund mechanics. But I thought this was a good place to start, and what can I say? I like hedge funds. Here’s some of what I learned:  While much of the retail focus is on individual tokens, institutions may use a combination of strategies instead.  It’s probably hyperbole to say that retail investors are only focused on specific tokens. But you’re more likely to overhear a discussion about bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) or maybe uniswap (UNI) on a given day than talk of arbitrage, market making and/or trend-following strategies within crypto.  Who doesn’t want to be the person who finds the next token that zooms up 10-fold in six months (or six hours, for that matter)? It’s what headlines, fortunes (and lost fortunes) are often made of. But it’s not the type of risk that I expect institutional capital to take.  I realized this when simply inquiring about Valmar’s approach to asset selection and whether it began with the asset itself or the sector from which the asset belongs. Man’s response provided context.  “I want to make the distinction that for us, our job is making allocations and determining our portfolio mix across strategies,” he said.  Here’s how I take that: It’s not about putting 45% of their money in BTC, 45% in ETH and the rest in altcoins. For institutions, it’s about allocating, say, 20% to market-making strategies, 30% to DeFi yield and 50% split between arbitrage and trend following.  This isn’t to imply that individual assets are an afterthought. Those tokens are primarily the means to deploy certain broader strategies.  Allocating capital with a focus on strategies rather than assets can work to provide diversified returns while limiting exposure to general market swings. It also means that monitoring the correlations of those strategies and the assurance of strategic discipline is paramount.  Macroeconomics, crypto market dynamics and regulatory clarity remain top of mind  Our conversation touched on monetary policy, crypto liquidity and regulations. He voiced concern the Federal Open Market Committee has raised rates too much.  “There continues to be a risk that, ultimately, if the Fed really wants to get back down to 2% inflation and they see that the markets are back to pretty much all-time highs, that just gives them more credibility to hike,” Man said. He acknowledged the Federal Reserve’s recent progress slowing inflation, but said the central bank has historically “never really nailed it.”  On an individual asset level, some of the issues prone to nascent markets like crypto stood out. He mentioned “low liquidity” and the “lack of the ability to borrow” as factors that need to evolve for crypto to move meaningfully higher.  On regulation, Man offered a note of optimism, expecting clarity eventually, while acknowledging the potential for a slow pace on the way there.  Running a fund requires multiple hats  One of the more interesting aspects of our conversation revolved around the growth and approach of the fund itself. Again, Valmar’s story is just one of many, but I imagine that the challenges of starting, scaling and running a fund are felt by all who attempt to do so.  One, in particular, involves the amount of time and effort needed for things outside of market analysis – things that would rank third for many traders if the other two choices were wearing a heavy coat in Florida and wearing no coat in Antarctica.  This includes raising capital, pitching ideas operations and on and on. The best traders on the planet still need assets to trade. In a competitive landscape, it requires skills beyond analysis and market timing.  Institutional funds with Valmar’s model often serve multiple client bases as well: the first being investors where performance is highlighted and the second being traders themselves.  While firms like Valmar implement and execute their own ideas, they also serve as a potential landing pad for independent traders, looking for a home to execute their own strategies. In that regard, the offering may include operational efficiencies, investor relations and data provision.  All told, the evolution of digital asset investment management appears to be running in concert with the evolution of the assets themselves. While much of the framework behind crypto hedge funds appears to have been derived from traditional finance, it also bears a lot of the nascency emblematic of cryptocurrencies themselves.  What comes next in crypto hedge funds will be as interesting to watch as market prices themselves.  Takeaways  From CoinDesk Deputy Editor-in-Chief Nick Baker, here is some news worth reading:  CORPORATE FINANCE: In my old TradFi journalism life, I spent no small amount of time dealing with stories about companies raising money by selling equity or debt. Let’s be honest: That is rarely exciting. Crucial for the companies involved, no doubt, but not exactly page-turners. And then comes Michael Saylor and his laser eyes. He’s kept investment bankers busy since the pandemic. His company, MicroStrategy, now holds about $4.5 billion worth of bitcoin (BTC), much of it purchased with money raised through securities offerings. And now MicroStrategy is at it again, planning to sell up to $750 million of its stock to fund bitcoin purchases and other things. He’s one of the biggest whales with sway over the market. News of his potential acquisitions immediately pushed BTC’s price higher.  DEFI DISASTER: Curve Finance is one of the more important players in decentralized finance (DeFi), a platform where traders can swap stablecoins or other products pegged to the same underlying asset. This is geeky stuff that serves as core infrastructure in DeFi. It was just exploited, with about $70 million taken from customers. Not great. But it gets worse. Curve’s CRV token dropped as a result, spelling potential trouble for founder Michael Egorov’s $168 million lending position backed by CRV. That stash gets liquidated if CRV gets too low and its price got uncomfortably close, raising a potential systemic risk for DeFi given how integral Curve is in that space. He managed to get a bailout from various parties including Justin Sun. Trouble briefly got real centralized in DeFi. CoinDesk’s Daniel Kuhn explores all this with the provocatively titled column, “DeFi Died and We Didn’t Even Notice.”  OF COURSE: Folks seem desperate for meme coins to work out these days. Pepecoin (PEPE) was a popular fad not long ago. Now people want to find the next one. Along comes BALD, which just zoomed higher for no good reason. BALD was so hot that it made Coinbase’s new Base blockchain a hopping place, even though it’s not even officially open yet. That’s not the crazy part. The crazy part is some crypto sleuths believe BALD’s origins can be traced to Alameda Research.

42419845,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG2CD,1690992000,Bitcoin Venture Capital Is Anything but Boring: Crypto Long & Short,"The Bitcoin ecosystem’s venture capital (VC) scene is more robust than you might realize, something we just reviewed at length in a research report. In fact, 2022 was a flagship year. Seed transactions were 133% higher last year versus 2021. There was 70% growth in total companies funded.  A select cohort of Bitcoin startups has “graduated” to the Series B stage or later, so the high growth in seed deals hints at potential early maturation of the ecosystem.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  Bitcoin VC grew while crypto VC stagnated  Crypto spot markets declined significantly since the November 2021 peak. In the aftermath, the overall crypto VC deal count effectively stagnated. Meanwhile, in contrast to that, Bitcoin VC emerged as a growth category, with 52.9% year-over-year growth.  Yet, a severe misallocation of capital remains  The purposeful and conservative approach to making changes to Bitcoin Core has given rise to the narrative that “nothing is happening on Bitcoin,” but the data shows that innovation across the Bitcoin stack has begun to accelerate in recent years. We expect innovation to flourish in the years to come, but for now, the market gap is highly significant. Just 1.31% of total 2022 crypto venture funding was invested in Bitcoin startups.  Building on the money: Methodical, but with step-function changes  Trammell Venture Partners (TVP) believes Bitcoin has “already won the battle to be the internet's base monetary layer,” noting some key distinctions. Namely, the Mark Zuckerberg ethos of “move fast and break things” is unsuitable when building a decentralized, global monetary network. Bitcoin Core development is rightfully methodical. That doesn’t mean it’s stagnant.  The Segregated Witness soft-fork activated in 2017 was a technical prerequisite for the Lightning Network, which has in turn grown to a capacity that has unleashed a subsequent wave of innovation. Similarly, Taproot (activated in November 2021) sets the stage for another wave. Of note is Lightning Labs’ Taproot Assets Protocol (TAP), facilitating asset issuance directly on the Lightning Network. If successful, TAP would allow the multi-asset reality to not only exist natively on the Bitcoin stack but also inherit the Lightning Network’s speed, very low cost and settlement finality.  Bitcoin’s careful development has begun to pay dividends. As the composability on the Bitcoin stack expands, TVP believes entrepreneurs will increasingly choose to build their business on the most secure, decentralized, mature platform possible: Bitcoin.

The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has declared US cryptocurrency investors must include staking rewards as part of their gross income. According to the IRS’s directive, taxpayers must include the fair market value of staking rewards as soon as they gain control of those assets. Staking Rewards Become Taxable The IRS’s directive states that staking rewards in crypto become subject to income tax within the US the moment they are in the taxpayer’s possession. It declares the instant an owner is awarded units of digital assets as incentives for validation, their fair market value must be included in the taxpayer’s income in the tax year in which the staking rewards were obtained. The IRS specifies: “The fair market value is determined as of the date and time the taxpayer gains dominion and control over the validation rewards.” According to the IRS, general tax principles apply to property transactions and crypto transactions. Thus, any reward obtained through staking must be included within an individual’s gross income as it applies to rent, royalties, and compensation for goods and services. Further, the IRS states taxpayers compensated for goods and services through cryptocurrencies, including crypto miners, must also include the market value of the assets as part of their taxable income. The agency explains: “If a cash-method taxpayer stakes cryptocurrency native to a proof-of-stake blockchain and receives additional units of cryptocurrency as rewards when validation occurs, the fair market value of the validation rewards received is included in the taxpayer’s gross income in the taxable year in which the taxpayer gains dominion and control over the validation rewards.” The Future of Staking in the US Remains Unclear Staking services have been the topic of controversy in the US over the past six months.

Coinbase has pressed the SES for regulatory clarity surrounding the industry, specifically concerning staking. The exchange petitioned the securities agency to exclude staking from its definition of securities. Still, the SEC maintain staking services through intermediaries, such as in the case of Kraken, which meets the requirements of the Howey Test and qualifies as securities.

42419821,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG1wj,1690991326,Bitcoin Is 'Big Barbie' Energy,"Australian actress Margot Robbie, star of the breakout summer blockbuster “Barbie,” called Bitcoin a ""Ken thing,"" in a playful remark directed at her husband this week. It got me thinking: Barbie would have been a fan of Bitcoin.  After all, Barbie's legacy of autonomy, entrepreneurship and empowerment aligns precisely with the principles of Bitcoin.  Aubrey Strobel is the host of ""The Aubservation"" podcast.  Barbie's story begins in 1959, a time when women faced significant social and legal barriers to financial independence. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act that granted women the right to open a bank account independently was still 15-years away. Despite this, Barbie became an icon and a symbol of feminine empowerment, a story that was expertly reimagined in director Greta Gerwig's latest film.  Barbie is full of contradictions: she's materialistic yet a good role-model, hyper-feminine but stridently independent, literally plastic while also being so much more. She surmounted countless obstacles and prejudices while reinforcing others, but also, ultimately, showed that empowerment doesn't always follow a predetermined script.  How did Barbie go from being essentially unbanked to a household name across the globe and model for empowerment?  One of the most compelling aspects of Barbie's legacy is her representation as a businesswoman. Throughout the years, she has been a leader across industries and professions as an astronaut, doctor and computer engineer – breaking gender stereotypes and demonstrating anyone can achieve anything to which they set their minds.  Perhaps most importantly, she set a powerful example for young girls and women to take control of their finances.  Drawing parallels between Barbie's entrepreneurial journey and the principles of Bitcoin, we find a shared pursuit of financial independence and self-empowerment. Bitcoin, as a decentralized digital currency, enables individuals to manage their financial futures without relying on traditional financial institutions. Of course Barbie the trailblazer, the independent thinker, and go-getter would see the value in Bitcoin.  See also: Aubrey Strobel – Yuga Labs' Embrace of Bitcoin NFTs Is a Big Deal | Opinion  Just as Barbie has challenged gender norms and pushed boundaries, Bitcoin can be a means for women to challenge the male-dominated financial landscape. Bitcoin allows female entrepreneurs to break into a fast-moving startup field and take charge, a legacy Barbie would be proud of. Perhaps Mattel should consider Barbie the cypherpunk or Barbie the crypto futurist next.  Promoting the achievements of women within the fintech space is crucial in challenging the misconception that Bitcoin is exclusively for men. Recognizing and celebrating female pioneers, traders, developers and influencers within the community will foster a more inclusive environment.  The spirit of Barbie's entrepreneurship aligns with the principles of Bitcoin. By showcasing her journey as a successful businesswoman, we can draw parallels between Barbie's empowerment and the opportunities Bitcoin offers. We should encourage more women, perhaps inspired by Barbie’s message, to also embrace Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is a pathway for financial independence – a ""Barbie thing.""",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,Aubrey Strobel,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/08/02/bitcoin-is-big-barbie-energy,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/97bd671d9aeb96a265b209067e63ed519c51a9b6-2048x1152.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419830,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG23x,1690991178,Why You Should Care About Litecoin: It's the Backbone of Dogecoin,"The Dogecoin blockchain, originally created as a joke, was at risk of attack in 2014 because it was on the verge of exhausting block rewards due to a frenzied pace of currency issuance.  So Charlie Lee, creator of the Litecoin blockchain, stepped in and proposed a “merged mining” arrangement, allowing Dogecoin to borrow Litecoin’s network security – ultimately rescuing the embattled cryptocurrency.  Dogecoin's DOGE cryptocurrency is now one of the world's largest, with a market value of $11 billion, and is a frequent talking point of Tesla CEO (and the billionaire owner of X, formerly known as Twitter).  Some industry veterans may dismiss Litecoin as a “ghost chain” – a network where cutting-edge technological development has all but disappeared. But here’s why today’s degenerate crypto traders might actually care about what happens to the network: The Litecoin blockchain provides security to Dogecoin, one of the best-known and most valuable blockchain projects.  Created as a joke in 2014 by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, Dogecoin has gotten added attention from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who regularly posts about it to his 150 million followers on his X social-media platform, formerly known as Twitter. The blockchain's DOGE cryptocurrency is inextricably linked to the adorable image of its mascot, the Shiba inu dog breed.  This article is featured in the latest issue of The Protocol, our weekly newsletter exploring the tech behind crypto, one block at a time. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  What’s no joke is that DOGE, one of the industry’s quintessential “meme coins,” has a market capitalization of nearly $11 billion, making it the eighth largest cryptocurrency ahead of Litecoin’s own $7 billion.  It’s no secret that Litecoin provides security to Dogecoin; CoinDesk wrote about it in 2014.  But the fact bears repeating now, with Litecoin making headlines Wednesday about its highly anticipated quadrennial blockchain “halving.""  Read more: Litecoin ‘Halving,’ Set for Wednesday, Should Harden Supplies of ‘Digital Silver’  Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, a computer scientist trained at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), created the network in 2011 by cloning Bitcoin’s code, which was the original blockchain, launched two years earlier by inventor Satoshi Nakamoto.  A couple of years after Litecoin’s debut, two software engineers, Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, created Dogecoin by allegedly cloning Luckycoin – itself a clone of Litecoin.  But there were some deficiencies in Dogecoin’s issuance model – the mechanics of its money supply – partly because it strayed from Bitcoin’s original parameters.  All three blockchains rely on a “proof-of-work” system that recruits “miners” to process transactions and secure the network in exchange for a form of compensation called a “block reward.” For Bitcoin and Litecoin, the reward is a combination of variable transaction fees and a predetermined “subsidy” that gets halved approximately every four years – a carefully chosen, marathon-like pace of issuance. (This is what happened Wednesday on Litecoin.)  Dogecoin’s halving schedule (and subsequent rate of issuance) before 2015, in stark contrast to that of its progenitors, was akin to a 100-meter dash. Blocks were generating every minute and rewards were getting halved every 69 days, resulting in block subsidies that rapidly depleted the network’s fixed supply of 100 billion DOGE.  “Because of that, the network security of Dogecoin went down really quickly,” Lee said.  Read more: 'Call Me the Dogefather': Elon Musk Explains Crypto to SNL's Audience  Without a subsidy, and with transaction fees too low to incentivize miners to stick around and secure the chain, the lighthearted dog-themed project would face a high probability of attack and subsequent implosion.  “Dogecoin was built to die quickly – none of us expected it to grow into the absurd entity it is today,” wrote Josh Mohland on the popular community site Reddit, in 2014. Mohland created the now defunct DOGE tipping service, Dogetipbot.  The situation became so dire that by 2014, Dogecoin had to hard fork – make a permanent change to its blockchain – to allow “merged mining” or auxiliary proof-of-work (AuxPoW) with Litecoin. It was essentially a method for miners to provide security to both blockchains simultaneously.  “There's absolutely an easy way to save the coin from its certain death (and by death, I mean 51% attacked for the lulz),” Mohland continued. “And that's AuxPoW.""  Merged mining is when miners simultaneously secure two or more networks, receiving rewards from both without a deterioration in performance. The reason it’s called auxiliary proof-of-work is because the process involves a less secure auxiliary blockchain borrowing security from a parent network with stronger security. In this scenario, Lee suggested that Litecoin could provide much-needed security to the embattled Dogecoin network.  Read more: Dogecoin Community Celebrates as Merge Mining with Litecoin Begins  “That was one of the main reasons why they needed to switch on merged mining with Litecoin,” Lee said. “And also one of the reasons why I stuck with Bitcoin’s halving schedule.”  “So that the Dogecoin network wouldn't be easily attacked,” he explained.  Dogecoin still generates blocks every minute or so, but nowadays, there are no more halvings and the 100 billion DOGE cap has been removed to allow for a 10,000 DOGE reward per block, indefinitely.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | DOGE | LTC | MINING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/02/why-you-should-care-about-litecoin-its-the-backbone-of-dogecoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/45966b878bf647cb2f088f88deba6ee99b06802b-5999x3374.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Kenyan Government Suspends Worldcoin’s Activities Only 10 days after the official launch of Worldcoin, the project has already been suspended in one of the few countries where the company’s iris-scanning device Orb was available. Kenya was one of the first countries to open registration for World ID back in 2021. It is also reportedly one of the regions that got the highest number of sign ups. Initially, Worldcoin listed around 18 Orb-locations that would open in Kenya but in the end left only one – Kenyatta International Convention Centre. Tens of thousands of Kenyans flocked to the Orb to get their iris scanned and receive the World ID. They may have also been motivated to undergo the procedure by the 25 WLD (equivalent to around 7,000 shillings) Worldcoin promised to give everyone for the identity verification. However, despite the platform's high demand in the country, the Kenyan government decided to suspend all Worldcoin’ activities on Wednesday, August 2. The Ministry of Interior and National Administration of Kenya reported that relevant agencies need to “certify the absence of risks to the general public whatsoever”. ""Relevant security, financial services and data protection agencies have commenced inquiries and investigations to establish the authenticity and legality of the aforesaid activities, and the safety and protection of the data being harvested, and how the harvesters intend to use the data,” Kithure Kindiki, Kenya’s Cabinet Secretary for the Ministry of Interior and National Administration, said in the statement. Worldcoin officials haven’t yet commented on the news. Worldcoin Continues to Face Backlash The controversial crypto project has been heavily criticized after its launch and received both applause and judgment. Even though only Kenya has officially suspended Worldcoin’s services so far, the company has been under scrutiny from a number of other countries, especially in Europe. France and the UK have recently reported that their privacy watchdogs are investigating the project to verify the security of the data it collects. On the day of the Worldcoin’s launch, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also published a long essay about Worldcoin in particular and the biometric proof of personhood in general.

On Tuesday afternoon, Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, bought CryptoPunk #4953 for 113.7 ETH, which cost him $208,000, according to data from Etherscan.  Last week, Beeple posted a tweet sharing he was “in the market for a punk,” claiming he had “never actually purchased a single PFP.” Several days later, he asked his followers what the best traits were for his punk purchase.  While Beeple didn’t immediately confirm he purchased the punk, CryptoPunks Brand Lead Noah Davis posted a tweet sharing a text conversation he had with Beeple about the NFT purchase. It’s somewhat of a full circle moment for Davis, who previously worked in digital art sales at auction house Christie’s and helped facilitate the record-breaking $69 million sale of Beeple’s Everydays: The First 5,000 Days in March 2021.  Late Tuesday evening, Beeple shared an original digital artwork titled “A Punk Is Born,” featuring himself made up as his new punk, with CryptoPunk #4953 in the upper right corner of the image as well as on the tiny computer screen.  On Wednesday afternoon, he posted about his new purchase, writing that CryptoPunks have ""changed the way we think about identity and ownership. i believe this is a historic work from both a technological and artistic perspective and it's influence on NFTs and this space is already undeniable."" He concluded the post by saying ""can't wait to connect and learn from more members of this incredible community, more on that very soons. ;)""  Beeple chose one of the rarer punks in the collection, making his purchase the most expensive NFT sold in the past 24 hours according to data from CryptoSlam.  The punk’s rarity traits include a mohawk, clown green eyes and a red clown nose. The nose, which the rarest punk trait of #4953, is only present in 2% of Punks according to marketplace OpenSea. Data from analytics tool Deep Value NFT shows that only one other Punk with this trait is currently listed at about 91.7 ETH, or $169,800.  Additional on-chain data shows that Beeple’s newly acquired Punk was previously purchased on February 4 2022 for 109 ETH by collector Twill – who still uses the PFP on his OpenSea account as of writing. However, the price of ether at the time was $3,000, which means Twill purchased it for $327,000 and took a sizable loss on the sale.  While Beeple may be new to the collector scene, he’s long been in the business of creating digital art. In March, he opened up a studio in Charleston, South Carolina to host in-person experiences bringing digital art creators and collectors together. This week, his Human One sculpture, which sold for $29 million in 2021, is on exhibit for the first time in the U.S. in the Crystal Bridges Museum in Arkansas.

Every four years, the blockchain's pace of new issuance of its LTC cryptocurrency is cut in half – the third reduction in the project's 12-year history was conducted on Wednesday.  Litecoin, one of the oldest and largest blockchains, underwent the third “halving” in its 12-year history, a key milestone for a project often referred to as “digital silver” in comparison to Bitcoin’s reputation as “digital gold.”  The event in the blockchain's lifecycle was expected, since it was programmed into the decentralized network's underlying code, prescribed to happen roughly every four years. Technically it meant that the ""block subsidy"" – the predetermined reward miners receive for processing transactions and securing the network – went down from 12.5 litecoin (LTC) to 6.25 LTC.  While the cut in rewards can reduce incentives for miners to continue securing the network, it benefits the project by helping achieve mass adoption without sacrificing the blockchain's security.  The reduction took place on Wednesday around 15:06 UTC (11:06 am ET) when the network reached block height 2,520,000, according to the website litecoinspace.org. It was the network’s third halving since its inception in 2011.  Few crypto analysts see Litecoin as one of the most technologically promising blockchains, but its vintage status and staying power have kept the project on the minds of crypto veterans. The native LTC cryptocurrency still ranks as one of the industry's most valuable, at about $7 billion.  Litecoin is also notable because it helps secure the Dogecoin blockchain, which despite being created as a joke in 2014, has become a top-20 project with a market capitalization of $14 billion. Dogecoin has become a frequent talking point of the billionaire Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and the owner of X, the social-media platform formerly known as Twitter.  Bitcoin and Litecoin both reward “miners” who process transactions and secure the network, with a reward – a combination of variable transaction fees and a predetermined “subsidy” that gets halved approximately every four years. (With Litecoin, they happen every 840,000 transaction blocks, and the average time to generate each block is about 2.5 minutes.)  Read more: Litecoin ‘Halving,’ Set for Wednesday, Should Harden Supply of ‘Digital Silver’  On Wednesday, that subsidy was officially reduced by 50%, meaning that miners have basically received a pay cut, albeit one they were already expecting.  Litecoin founder Charlie Lee says these disinflationary halvings help achieve mass adoption without sacrificing network security.  “Satoshi chose four-year block halving so that it gives enough time for the network to grow in time for the fees to eventually take over.” Lee explained during a Twitter livestream last week. “The idea is that there will be enough usage on-chain creating enough fees. The fees will be enough to pay the miners to continue to help secure the network.”  Lee knew Bitcoin was special after he read an article in 2011 about how it was the exclusive payment method on Silk Road, a marketplace for illicit drugs; a feat no traditional payment method could accomplish at the time.  He was so impressed that when he later decided to start his own project, he cloned Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto’s code – including many of the original blockchain’s key features. One of those was the implementation of periodic “halvings” into the blockchain’s underlying programming, for a 50% reduction in the pace of new issuance of the cryptocurrency every four years or so.  Charlie Lee has an older brother, Bobby Lee, who is the CEO and co-founder of Ballet, a manufacturer of special cards used for “cold storage” or holding crypto offline. The pair have teamed up to commemorate the blockchain’s third halving by creating 500 collectible cards made of 99.9% pure silver.  The cards themselves – the silver alone – could carry a value of roughly $40 a card, but they would also be loaded with 6.25 LTC, about $581. They are expected to be sold for around $1,000, which means the premium would represent some intangible value to buyers. All proceeds from the sale will be donated to the Litecoin Foundation to further the blockchain’s adoption and development, according to Charlie Lee.  “It's on a silver card,” Charlie Lee explained. “So even if litecoin goes to zero, it will still be worth the price of silver.”  Litecoin's market capitalization is currently around $7 billion. LTC was trading at $89.02 at the time of reporting, down 4% in the past 24 hours.  “Like I’ve previously said, a lot of the price action is a self-fulfilling prophecy,” Charlie Lee said. “Just because people think the halving is going to cause the price to go up, they will buy ahead of the halving or even right after the halving.”  “For bitcoin and litecoin, sometimes the price went up before, sometimes it runs up afterwards,” he added. “Sometimes it doesn't really have too much of an effect. It all depends on how the market reacts to the halving.”",POSITIVE,LTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | LTC | MARKET | TRADING,Frederick Munawa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/02/litecoin-undergoes-third-halving-in-milestone-for-12-year-old-blockchain,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/85ce0539f2cc237ca378e450c9aad65733d6b2f2-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to new data published by Santiment, they are now accumulating tokens projected to rise in the bull market. The data shows that over the last eight weeks, Shiba Inu sharks and dolphins have bought $9 million worth of SHIB. Sharks and dolphins are wallets that hold between 10 million-100 billion SHIB tokens. The accumulation of SHIB tokens comes after the public release of a beta bridge in anticipation of the Shibarium launch. Shibarium is Shiba Inu’s most anticipated layer-2 scaling solution expected to improve network performance. The launch scheduled for August is expected to cause a SHIB rally. Now trading at $0.000008384, Shiba Inu is expected to bridge the $0.000010 resistance at the launch of Shibarium. Pomerdoge (POMD) Accumulation Spikes Ahead of Massive Rally Another token Shiba Inu investors have been stacking up is Pomerdoge (POMD). The new play-to-earn token promises even bigger returns than Shiba Inu in 2023. Promising up to a 4,000% increase before the end of 2023, Pomerdoge has captured the attention of a lot of investors. It combines the already popular meme coin sector with the fast-growing P2E sector. The goal is to create an immersive gaming ecosystem where gamers are rewarded for their accomplishments as well as their effort. Gamers will create avatars in the ecosystem known as Pomerdoges. They will be able to customize and upgrade their Pomerdoges to increase their chances of winning in competitions. Pomerdoge will also allow gamers to interact amongst themselves outside the area for competitions. The ecosystem will also feature a Pomerplace – a non-fungible token marketplace. Here, the gamers will be able to trade skins, in-game items, and other valuable assets. The combination of meme coins with entertainment is what has made POMD one of the most popular tokens still in presale. Early participants of the presale will get access to an exclusive collection of 7,777 NFTs. Each of these NFTs will hold immense value and benefits. At the time of this writing, the POMD token trades at $0.007 in the first stage of its presale. The promised price rally would see the token trade as high as $0.28 by the end of this year.

On the other hand, Litecoin (LTC) and TRON (TRX) are swinging wildly, making their holders nervous. The crypto market is intrinsically volatile, but you can get some enormous returns on your investment if you choose a stable, and growth-oriented project. >>Register For The Tradecurve Presale Litecoin’s (LTC) Trade Volume Sinks Amid the current dwindling market, Litecoin (LTC) has not been able to put up a strong performance. As per the data from Tradingview, the trading volume on the Litecoin network has been declining. Subsequently, the price of Litecoin has tumbled, with its exchange rate falling by 18% in the past week. Currently, Litecoin is being traded at $72.58. Experts say that Litecoin’s market health has worsened since the SEC described LTC as a security. Thus, the hype around Litecoin’s upcoming halving event has waned. Although the Litecoin community hopes to see a price rebound ahead of the halving event scheduled in August, the fading hype around it may hurt LTC in the long run. TRON (TRX) And DWF Labs Join Hands TRON (TRX) has been suffering with selloff pressure for the past many days. Subsequently, Tron’s value on exchanges has taken a toll. The trading price of TRON has nosedived by more than 10% in the past seven days. At the time of writing, TRON is changing hands at $0.0695. Meanwhile, to sustain its network growth and prevent the price from falling further, TRON has entered into a strategic partnership with DWF Labs. Through this collaboration, DWF Labs will act as a liquidity provider for TRON. However, experts believe that TRON will not be able to get any immediate relief with this partnership. Tradecurve Shows Bullish Path To Dwindling Market After the collapse of the FTX exchange, which wiped out $2 billion in customer funds, traders have become apprehensive about the credibility of centralized exchanges. The situation has worsened with the latest lawsuits filed against well-established platforms like Binance and Coinbase. Therefore, traders are jumping ships to register on the Tradecurve (TCRV) exchange. It is a new decentralized trading platform, which is set to enter the top 3 crypto exchanges list. The platform enables people to trade various classes of assets on a single platform, without relying on fiat payments. To assure traders of their anonymity and privacy, Tradecurve has not implemented any KYC procedure on the platform. This makes it one of the first such crypto exchanges, eclipsing other centralized platforms like Coinbase, where users are mandated to input their sensitive details. It has also implemented 2FA security, and DeFi capabilities to ensure the protection of traders. The platform offers many benefits to its token holders, including exclusive deposit bonuses, discounts on transaction fees, and high leverage starting from 500:1. The platform’s presale stage 5 is live, and a token is now available for $0.025. The project’s market value has been pegged to grow by 80x in the next few months.

This comes as another blow for the token in what has been an unpleasant week so far. This unfavorable run has had an impact on the price of HEX, which is currently valued at $0.00486457. According to CoinGecko data, the token’s price has declined by more than 12% in the last day, as it continues in a downward trend. Uniswap Withdraws Support For “Unregistered Security” HEX Uniswap has delisted the HEX token from its interface, placing it in the protocol’s “Unsupported List.” It is a list manually curated by Uniswap Labs – the developer of the protocol – to restrict tokens that violate trademarks, projects that have proven to be scams, or otherwise based on legal considerations. Following the SEC’s declaration on Monday, July 31, it appears that Uniswap is distancing itself from the HEX token. This declaration came when the financial regulator filed a lawsuit against Richard “Heart” Scheuler, the founder of HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX (a Uniswap fork). Related Reading: Breaking: HEX Token Plummets 25% Following SEC Lawsuit Against Founder Richard Heart In the court document, the Securities and Exchange Commission mentioned Uniswap as one of the factors behind its selection of the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York as the case’s venue. The commission said it chose this venue because many of the transactions highlighted in the lawsuit occurred on Uniswap, which is headquartered in Brooklyn, New York. The SEC accused the controversial Richard Heart of offering an “unregistered security”, the HEX token. Other angles of the case include HEX’s staking mechanism, its lock-up schedule, and how Heart manipulated the token’s supply by “recycling” transactions. The regulator claims that, by making “grandiose” promises of wealth, Heart was able to raise $1 billion from investors, which he “inappropriately” spent on luxury goods. The Crypto Community Reacts After the news of Uniswap blocking traders from trading the HEX token broke out, there has been a mixed reaction from the crypto community on Twitter. Several tweets are questioning the “decentralized” nature of Uniswap, with some users even going as far as giving the protocol a bad review on various review platforms.

42419823,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG1yn,1690988330,Ethereum Juggernaut MetaMask’s Origin Story Challenged in New Lawsuit,"In a lawsuit, crypto OG Joel Dietz says Consensys stole his idea for an in-browser crypto wallet.  Consensys’ MetaMask is the most important Ethereum crypto wallet.  The origin story of Ethereum’s most important crypto wallet – MetaMask – may be headed to court.  In a lawsuit filed in state court in San Francisco on Tuesday, Joel Dietz, an entrepreneur who says he spearheaded early efforts to build a browser-based digital wallet, accused the Ethereum-focused developer firm Consensys of writing him out of its history and stealing his share of its treasure.  MetaMask is the world’s most widely used crypto wallet and the powerhouse asset of Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin’s Consensys, a company last valued at $7 billion in early 2022. MetaMask was created in 2016 by Consensys employees Aaron Davis and Dan Finlay, according to the company.  But, according to Dietz, he created the intellectual property that he says became MetaMask in late 2014, when he founded a project called Vapor. In his lawsuit, he accuses Davis, whom he says he hired in 2015 to help code Vapor, of betraying him and conspiring instead with Consensys.  A Consensys spokesperson said: “Joel Dietz is an individual we understand to have been falsely marketing himself as the founder of MetaMask in an attempt to sell tokens or gain investment from unsuspecting investors globally. Joel Dietz is not a founder of MetaMask, has no relation to MetaMask or any of its technology and we look forward to the court promptly disposing of these frivolous claims. MetaMask was founded by Aaron Davis and Dan Finlay in 2016. The origin story of how MetaMask came to life is publicly available here.”  Ethereum’s earliest days  The history of Dietz’s Vapor is entangled in Ethereum’s earliest days. In an interview with CoinDesk, Dietz said he came up with the vision for an in-browser crypto wallet more than half a year before the blockchain went live in July 2015.  Even then, Dietz said he was a fan of Ethereum’s potential to host software programs that anyone could use on a decentralized platform that no one could stop. But he thought it needed a wallet through which people might navigate this universe right from their browser, instead of first downloading a clunky, separate app.  Dietz said he pitched Vapor to key Ethereum figures Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood in November 2014 “and got an initial sign-off from them” to build it, plus encouragement from Buterin to seek a grant from their Ethereum Foundation. He said he did so in March 2015, having brought on two partners, Martin Becze and Aaron Davis.  Within this group, Dietz fashioned himself as the product’s visionary, spokesperson and fundraiser, while Becze and Davis were its primary coders, according to the lawsuit. He said they planned to build it as an open-source project but had a road map to eventually monetize it by imposing fees on users who swap between different cryptocurrencies within the app.  (Under Consensys, MetaMask has generated over $220 million in swap fees, according to one estimate of its lifetime revenue.)  But the $30,000 they received from the Ethereum Foundation in early 2015 barely funded two months of work on Vapor; other fundraising efforts, including an application to join the storied accelerator program Y Combinator, didn’t pan out.  Dietz moves on  By May, Dietz seemed to think Vapor was losing momentum and, not hearing anything to prove otherwise from Davis, the developer, he shifted his focus to other ventures. Dietz didn’t think much of it when Davis nixed his access to their shared Slack server and GitHub repositories; as far as he was concerned, Vapor and its vision to build an in-browser crypto wallet was dead.  One year later, Consensys debuted MetaMask, the Chrome browser extension that made it easy for anyone to send, spend and swap cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum blockchain. It credits Davis as one of the app’s founders, but has never mentioned Dietz.  According to Dietz, Consensys has gone to great lengths to suppress his involvement in MetaMask’s creation. He alleges the company threatened a journalist whose article described Dietz as the founder of MetaMask in November 2021.  At this point, Dietz said he pieced together “the exact relationship” linking his Vapor and Consensys’ MetaMask, and became convinced that he had been wronged. The way he saw it, Ethereum’s insiders had pulled “an elaborate internal rug pull” on him.  “These were things that Vitalik specifically asked me to do – and then they just never compensated me at all for anything,” he said. “So, it feels kind of like a rigged insider game.”  He added: “I’m confident that the case will show the substantial evidence that proves my role as a founding partner of MetaMask, and I know several colleagues in our community will verify that.”  UPDATE (Aug. 2, 2023, 18:13 UTC): Adds an additional comment from Dietz in the final paragraph.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/02/ethereum-juggernaut-metamasks-origin-story-challenged-in-new-lawsuit,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6006797fd888631272026417c32187e78706ead8-1667x938.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42419818,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcUG1sb,1690988267,Decentralized Exchange THORSwap Introduces New Feature Aimed at Better Price Execution for Large Trades,"THORSwap – a multichain decentralized exchange aggregator – introduced yesterday Streaming Swaps, a new feature aimed at reducing slippage and getting better price execution for large decentralized finance (DeFi) trades.  Slippage, the difference between a trade’s expected price and the actual price at which the transaction is executed, typically transpires when volatility is high or market liquidity is low.  Before the introduction of Streaming Swaps, if a crypto user wanted to execute a large trade and achieve lower slippage on THORChain, they would have to manually divide the swap into several smaller transactions, resulting in higher gas fees. With the new feature, large swaps are broken down internally on THORChain, resulting in a single outbound transaction, “allowing for potentially a more favorable average price,” according to a blog post.  Streaming Swaps is aimed at attracting new users, liquidity and volume as “the goal is to outperform centralized exchanges (CEX) in speed, privacy and price execution,” per the blog post.  RUNE, the native token for THORChain has increased almost 1% in the past 24 hours to 93 cents, per CoinGecko.

15559946,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545493,1690984819,Shiba Inu Price Prediction: Is Shibarium The Key To A Trend Reversal?,"In recent weeks, the meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) has shown signs of recuperation, gradually recovering from its yearly low of $0.00000597, reached on June 10. SHIB was following the pawprints of its rival, Dogecoin (DOGE), which recently garnered momentum following a profile update from Elon Musk. As the value of SHIB began to move upward, anticipation around the forthcoming release of Shibarium, a layer 2 solution, also began to ripple through the investor community. The announcement that Shibarium will be unveiled at the Blockchain Futurist Conference held from August 15-16, 2023, in Canada, ignited a flicker of optimism. However, there is still no clear confirmation for a trend reversal from a technical perspective for SHIB. Can Shiba Inu Finally Enter Bullish Territory? While DOGE has already breached the threshold of the 200-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average) – a widely respected metric in chart analysis – SHIB has yet to break through this key technical indicator. In simplified terms, an asset above the 200-day line indicates an uptrend, while trading below suggests a downtrend. Related Reading: Shibarium Hype: Shiba Inu Whales Boost Appetite, Snag 1 Trillion SHIB Tokens A classical approach would recognize a strong buy signal when the price moves from below to above the trend line. Investors with an eye on SHIB continue to await for this buy signal. This is despite the meme coin currently trading 55% higher compared to its low on June 10. Remarkably, the recent positive price trend did enable SHIB to ascend beyond the 50-day EMA (orange), a modest victory in its own right. At the moment, SHIB faces an uphill battle against the 100-day EMA, priced at $0.00000840. As of press time, Shiba Inu traded just shy of this mark, at $0.00000830. Another bullish argument is that the meme coin recently broke out of the ascending triangle formation that had held it captive since mid-June. SHIB should not fall back below the formation’s former resistance at $0.00000831 to confirm the breakout. Remarkably, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level is also at this level, making this price twice as important. If Shiba Inu can maintain its current position and use the 23.6% Fibonacci level as support, it could successfully break above the horizontal resistance around $0.00000870. Then, a subsequent jump to the bullish boundary – the 200-day EMA at $0.00000933 – could be on the cards. Should SHIB bulls accomplish this feat, the price would technically trigger a buy signal. This could potentially pave the way for a further surge, with the next resistance looming at the 38.6% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.00000976. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Reclaims 14th Spot In Market After 5% Jump At this point, substantial selling pressure can be expected, given that this price level functioned as strong support from early March to early May this year. Additional price targets are the 50% Fibonacci level at $0.00001093 and the 61.8% Fibonacci level at $0.00001209. A bearish scenario would be triggered if SHIB fails to sustain the breakout above $0.00000831 on the 1-day chart. A drop to the previous month’s low of $0.00000709 could be in the offing. Holding this price level will be critical to avoid revisiting the year’s low at $0.00000597. Yet, with the much-anticipated launch of Shibarium less than a month away, this bearish scenario appears less probable. The question that investors are grappling with: Will Shibarium be the catalyst that finally signals a trend reversal for Shiba Inu? Only time will reveal the answer.

Retirement Funds Tied to Blacklisted Chinese Firms Lawmakers have expressed concern that Americans' retirement funds are unknowingly being funneled into Chinese firms flagged for security and human rights issues, and they believe BlackRock has been involved in this process. The House of Representatives Select Committee on the CCP has notified BlackRock about the investigations, with the intention of gathering facts to inform U.S. policies on capital flows to China. According to the committee, the massive influx of American capital into these Chinese entities further exacerbates national security threats and undermines American values. The committee has claimed that the firm has facilitated the investment of over $429 million across five funds in such blacklisted Chinese companies. The committee has raised concerns over the scope of these investments, suggesting that the true scale may be much larger. BlackRock's Response In response to the allegations, BlackRock has denied any wrongdoing. The firm stated that it complies with all applicable U.S. government laws in its investments, both in China and markets around the world. The investment firm, which manages over $9 billion of assets, expressed its willingness to engage directly with the Select Committee regarding the issues raised. The news of the investigation has impacted BlackRock's stock, with shares down 0.8% in mid-afternoon trade, underperforming the main stock indexes. The Broader U.S.-China Tensions This investigation is just one example of the wider implications of the ongoing tensions between the U.S. and China. As these tensions continue, U.S. companies are facing challenges in their operations and investments related to China. The impact of the investigation is not limited to BlackRock alone. Other asset management firms like Franklin Templeton, VanEck, and WisdomTree also have funds or ETFs with Chinese assets. However, these firms have not yet responded to requests for comment on their investments. The Select Committee, led by Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Democrat Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, holds significant power in making policy recommendations and can subpoena executives and officials. While it has not used this authority until now, Representative Gallagher had previously stated his intention to issue subpoenas for uncooperative executives. As the investigation unfolds, it remains to be seen how BlackRock and other asset managers with Chinese investments will navigate the complexities of U.S.-China relations and comply with the committee's inquiries.

42392810,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC4Uv,1690981621,CRV Gets Plunge Protection on Binance as Market Makers Add Bid-Side Liquidity,"Crypto market makers stepped in on Binance to support Curve's native token CRV after the decentralized exchange's late Sunday exploit sent the cryptocurrency crashing and threatened the liquidation of a large CRV-collateralized borrowing and market-wide contagion.  The 2% bid-side market depth, or the collection of buy orders within 2% of the mid-price, doubled from roughly 500,000 CRV to more than 1 million CRV following the exploit, according to Paris-based crypto data provider Kaiko.  In other words, the ability of the market to absorb large orders at stable prices doubled due to an influx of buy-side liquidity. The 10% bid-side depth on Binance also increased sharply.  The surge in the bid depth is surprising and is reflective of market makers offering plunge protection to the cryptocurrency, according to Clara Medalie, director of research at Kaiko.  ""Market makers tend to pull orders to avoid getting caught in an unfavorable price swing,"" Medalie told CoinDesk. ""That is why liquidity disappeared on order books during big market events, such as the March banking crisis or FTX collapse,"" she continued. ""Right after the Curve exploit, we saw the opposite trend, with liquidity being added to the CRV order books, specifically on the bid side.""  CRV fell over 14% to 58 cents immediately following the late Sunday exploit. The quick drop raised fears of a potential liquidation of Curve founder Michael Egorov's multi-million dollar worth of USDT and FRAX borrowings collateralized by CRV, and spurred more CRV selling. The negative feedback loop threatened to push prices down to Egorov's then liquidation level of 37 cents.  Potential liquidation could have destabilized the broader decentralized finance market. As of now, the panic has been averted.  ""It's clear that there are A LOT of incentives to not have CRV price drop below a certain level,"" Medalie added.  While the bid side depth on Binance doubled, overall liquidity in native token terms across other exchanges did not see a notable change, Medalie added, echoing FalconX Research's view.",POSITIVE,CRV,CRV | EXCHANGE | MARKET | RESEARCH | BNB,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/08/02/crv-gets-plunge-protection-on-binance-as-market-makers-add-bid-side-liquidity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/334e448c8dceeec72b121a354f414cfe3e7e45ff-1280x689.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42392807,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC4Pn,1690981457,DeFi Protocol Abracadabra Wants to Charge 200% Interest on Curve Founder’s $18M Loan,"Abracadabra is proposing measures to protect from a bad debt situation stemming from an $18 million loan to Curve Finance founder Michael Egarov.  If passed, the protocol would automatically sell crv tokens to liquidate the position unless topped up with more collateral, putting selling pressure on an already stressed crv market.  As decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols scramble to protect themselves from the risks posed by a massive loan taken against crv (CRV) tokens, one platform is proposing an aggressive measure – raising interest rates on that loan exponentially to effectively liquidate the position.  Abracadabra Finance today floated a proposal that introduces sky-high interest rates on two specific pools it terms “cauldrons” that are made up of crv belonging to Curve Finance founder Michael Egarov.  Egarov has taken out $18 million from Abracadabra at a current rate of 18%. But Wednesday’s protocol seeks to increase this to 200% – effectively squeezing him out. The move seeks to reduce Abracadabra’s overall crv exposure to just $5 million worth of tokens.  “Given the current outstanding principal is $18M, the base rate would be 200%. At this interest rate, the loan would be fully covered within 6 months. As the principal is repaid, the base rate would decrease,” the proposal read.  The hike is not a total interest rate bump, but a gradual rate that starts at 200% and decreases as the loan is paid back by automatically selling crv tokens. Developers expect the loan to be paid back in six months with such a strategy, with all proceeds going to the Abracabadra treasury.  “We believe this solution will reduce negative externalities associated with such positions compared to a simple interest rate hike,” developers wrote in the proposal.  A staggering 99.95% of the Abracadabra community has voted in favor of the proposal as of Wednesday at 13:00 UTC, governance data shows.  Such concerns were earlier raised in a June post by community member “0xthespaniard,” who said that while the 18% interest charged on the large loan “meaningfully contributes” to the protocol’s profitability, the platform ultimately faces asymmetric downside risk.  “There are several indications that a liquidation would prove to be fatal to the Abracadabra protocol,” 0xthespaniard warned at the time. “According to Curve’s own DEX front-end, a 10M CRV swap (equivalent to approximately $6.7M at spot prices) is expected to cause a 30% price impact on Curve’s own DEX.”  “The gigabrains over at (risk management firm) Gauntlet conducted their own simulations and are estimating that the markets would struggle to support even a $6M liquidation,"" he added. ""It seems incredibly unlikely that Abracadabra would be able to liquidate the full CRV position without incurring significant amounts of bad debt.""  Curve Finance, a stablecoin swapping giant, suffered a Sunday exploit that drove down the price of the CRV token, putting a $168 million stash of founder Michael Egorov's money at risk of being liquidated.  This created bearish sentiment for the tokens among traders alongside concerns that liquidated assets would have to be sold into a market where prices are already falling. The liquidation of such a large position could put pressure on other DeFi protocols because CRV is used as a trading pair and ballast in trading pools across the ecosystem.",NEGATIVE,CRV,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/02/defi-protocol-abracadabra-wants-to-charge-200-interest-on-curve-founders-18m-loan,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dd3a09c4469c344853c1c441023c81a6ca25c38f-1000x667.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

IMF enslavement The International Monetary Fund (IMF) was established after the Bretton Woods agreement, and since then has provided loans to developing countries, however some have pointed out that the loans have served to export the dollar and enslave countries with repayments rather than help them to develop. Argentina is one of the most indebted countries in the world, having defaulted many times in its torrid financial history. The latest default avoidance was made possible by the People’s Bank of China stepping in and providing the means for Argentina to meet its IMF obligation by way of $1.7 billion in yuan currency swaps. According to the South China Morning Post, the intervention of the PBoC and the Latin American Development Bank has only succeeded in buying time for Argentina. Ariel Gonzalez Levaggi of the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina was quoted by the SCMP as saying “it does not provide a viable way out for Argentina.” However, it does mean that for now Argentina does not have to dip into any of its dollar reserves, which wouldn’t have been adequate with which to pay the debt and would have placed the country in an extremely precarious situation. Further encroachment into dollar hegemony This recent move by China is seen by many as an attempt to undermine the use of the US dollar for debt settlement, and another nail in the coffin of de-dollarisation. Alexandre Coelho of the International Political Science Association, and former legal advisor to the Bank of China said on the matter: “Although the renminbi has been part of the IMF currency basket since 2016, its use for debt settlement is not common. The path chosen by Argentina sets a precedent and may, in the future, be adopted by other emerging countries in a similar situation,” As the BRICS countries prepare for their summit later this month, and a potential announcement of a rumoured gold-backed currency to rival the dollar reserve currency, the US domination of global finances could certainly be slackening. Bitcoin - the last hope for world citizens In addition, the IMF’s scathing view of El Salvador’s adoption of Bitcoin as a joint legal currency with the dollar while at the same time exacting a promise from the Argentine central bank to steer clear of Bitcoin as a requirement for payment of its loan looks to be patronising and a form of bullying. The global financial system is changing, and whether the good will of China is actually that, and not just a way of usurping monetary power from the US in order to achieve its own world domination remains to be seen. This is probably the likely scenario, and therefore Bitcoin is still potentially the only way out of super power domination for the world’s citizens. A currency/store of value such as Bitcoin, that has no government or politics backing it, remains an extremely attractive proposition.

As part of the report, the company shared its XRP holdings as of March 31, 2023, and June 30, 2023. Ripple’s XRP Holdings Ripple revealed that its XRP holdings fall into two categories; wallet-held XRPs and ones in escrow lockups (Ripple releases one billion XRP monthly as part of its monthly token unlock). As of March 31, 2023 (representing the first quarter of the year), Ripple held 5,506,585,918 XRP and a further 42,800,000,013 XRP subject to on-ledger escrow.

From the report, Ripple grew its XRP holdings in Q2 as the Q2 figures are slightly up from the Q1 figures. However, its XRP tokens in escrow at the end of Q2 slightly reduced compared to the Q1 figure. XRP price still holding $0.69 | Source: XRPUSD on Tradingview.com Ripple Addresses Popular Misconceptions Ripple also addressed some misconceptions from the recent court ruling that XRP isn’t a security. On July 13, 2023, Judge Analisa Torres ruled in favor of Ripple in the ongoing case between the crypto company and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The first misconception Ripple addressed in the report was whether or not the ruling was a split decision, as several media outlets had tagged Ripple’s victory again the SEC as a ‘partial victory.’ The crypto firm has debunked this claim by categorically stating that the ruling isn’t a split decision. Ripple stated that the ruling was a big win for its firm and the crypto industry as it provides regularity clarity not only for Ripple but also to other token issuers, as they can now determine that their tokens, in and out of themselves, are not securities. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is The Best Thing To Happen To Bitcoin, Mike Novogratz Says The company also stated in the report that its XRP tokens were never a security. It admitted that there are instances where XRP (just like “an orange grove or a gold bar”) can be sold as an investment contract. However, such events don’t “magically transform” the token into a security. Ripple’s XRP enjoyed a significant rally following the court’s ruling, but there remain concerns that an appeal from the SEC could see the token lose most of its gains from the post-lawsuit rally. As of the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.69, according to data from CoinGeko.

A validator participates in verifying new transactions and helps maintain the security of a blockchain.  The initiative builds on Google Cloud and Celo’s long-standing relationship, including a previous collaboration where the Web2 giant worked with Celo to offer workshops and cloud computing services to developers and Web3 founders building on the network.  The Celo network recently passed a proposal to migrate from its own independent blockchain to an Ethereum layer-2 solution in a bid to simplify liquidity sharing between the two networks and to boost security.  “In order to streamline and accelerate the proposed transition to the Ethereum ecosystem, cLabs will leverage Google Cloud’s Blockchain Node Engine, a fully managed node-hosting service,” a press release noted.  The Blockchain Node Engine will facilitate node operations for Celo participants by relaying transactions and not waiting for nodes to sync, making it easier for Celo 2.0 to align with the Ethereum network, according to the press release.  “At Google Cloud, we’re focused on strengthening the Web3 ecosystem by offering founders and developers the tools they need to scale their applications,” Carlos Arena, director of digital assets at Google Cloud, said. “Running a validator on the Celo network builds on our collaboration with the Celo Foundation, and we look forward to helping to enable the growth of the network.”  The Celo Foundation was a founding partner of Google Cloud’s Web3 startup program.  Celo's token CELO rose as much as 6% in the minutes following the story. It's since pared some of those gains, but remains higher by 2.4% over the past 24 hours.

Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  As many as six asset managers have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) for ether (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs). First off the block on July 28 was the Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF. That filing was quickly followed by five other applications: the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF all were submitted to the SEC by August 1. Grayscale currently operates the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) with just more than $3 billion in assets under management. It’s suffered from a long period of trading at a substantial discount to net asset value – 41.5% as of yesterday.  MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer that’s amassed a giant bitcoin stash in recent years, filed to raise up to $750 million in share sales, with plans to use the proceeds to in part buy more bitcoin. The news came just after the company announced its second quarter results late Tuesday afternoon. Including some small bitcoin purchases made last month, MicroStrategy’s holdings as of July 31 amounted to 152,800 tokens worth about $4.5 billion at current prices. The news seemingly gave a lift to bitcoin, which quickly rose about 3% and briefly breached $30,000. The price has since pulled back to the current $29,500.  Binance counts China as its largest market, followed by South Korea, Turkey, Vietnam, and the British Virgin Islands, according to documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. The Journal reports that despite the ban on crypto within China, teams from Binance regularly collaborate with Chinese law enforcement to detect potential criminal activity. It also has 900,000 active users in-country, according to the report. A spokesperson for the exchange did not immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment. Data from the Journal shows that China is a $80.6 billion futures market and a $9.4 billion spot market for Binance. Second place South Korea provides $56.9 billion in futures volume and $1.39 billion in spot volume, and fifth place British Virgin Islands is responsible for $12.82 billion in spot volume and $5 billion in futures volume.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows the number of addresses with a non-zero bitcoin balance has increased to a new record high of 47.9 million.  Per Glassnode, it's a sign of continued bitcoin adoption.

Cash, BTC and cash deposits totaled ~$2.4M as of July 31, in line with its cash and crypto holdings of $2.3M as of June 30. Digihost ( DGHI ) continued to monetize a portion of its BTC production to fully fund its energy costs, consistent with its commitment to avoid equity dilution for shareholders. As a result of Digihost's ( DGHI ) site acquisition in Q1, its consolidated operating capacity across three sites increased to ~100 MW, representing ~2 EH of computing power. Digihost ( DGHI ) projects that total capacity will be fully deployed by Q3-end.

42392790,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC3Fz,1690977600,"Coinbase Analysts Optimistic Ahead of Q2 Earnings, but Warn About USDC Risks and Lower Trading Volumes","Coinbase earnings are expected to come in strong based on the resilience of retail trading activity on the exchange.  But some warned Coinbase’s revenue from the USDC stablecoin could decline, and the SEC’s lawsuit against the exchange could hurt trading volumes.  Traders of Coinbase (COIN) are likely in for a better-than-expected earnings report for the second quarter, analysts predict, but regulatory risks, as well as the threat of lower trading volumes, continue to persist.  FactSet consensus estimates call for Coinbase’s revenue to decrease from the previous quarter, to $629 million from $773 million. Trading volume for the period ending June 30 is expected to have slowed down to $114 billion from Q1 when it was $145 billion. And earnings per share are expected to be a loss of $0.76, compared to a loss of $0.34 in the first quarter.  “We expect adjusted EBITDA to come in well ahead of consensus,” analysts at British banking giant Barclays wrote in a report on Tuesday. In an earlier note from July 13, they said they had been impressed by the resilience of retail trading activity on the exchange. However, they noted that the upside remaining over the longer term could compress.  Shares of Coinbase are currently up 177% year-to-date, which is thanks to two factors, Barclays said. One is the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of New York judge’s ruling that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts, which bolsters Coinbase’s argument that many of the tokens it sells are not securities.  And the second is multiple applications from financial institutions for spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETF), which could greatly expand the availability of and demand for bitcoin.  However, the rally could be short-lived. Berenberg analyst Mark Palmer warned in a note on Tuesday that another judge from the same district rejected the ruling , arguing that there should be no distinction between institutional sales and sales to retail investors on crypto exchanges. In a separate note on Monday, Palmer also wrote that the “underpinnings of COIN’s recent rally were shaky and that the reality of the company's still-precarious situation may come back into focus with the release of its Q2 report.”  He also warned about risks coming from the USDC stablecoin, which generated $199 million, or 27% of Coinbase’s net revenue from interest income in Q1.  “The market cap of USDC has continued its steady decline,” Palmer said. “Now, USDC, and Coinbase’s revenue derived from it, could be facing another threat.” This is because of concerns raised by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other regulators regarding stablecoins.  Another area of concern is Coinbase’s trading volume, which remained low in July, Barclays noted, citing data from The Block which showed that exchange volume in July was down 5% month-over-month.  “We had expected COIN to report weak Q2 23 trading volumes even before the SEC filed a lawsuit against it on June 6, and we believe the overhang from the suit could result in persistent weakness in the company’s trading volumes as well as a reduction in the amount of assets on its platform,” Berenberg’s Palmer wrote.",NEUTRAL,USDC,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TRADING | USDC,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/08/02/coinbase-analysts-optimistic-ahead-of-q2-earnings-but-warn-about-usdc-risks-and-lower-trading-volumes,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/995f695f22ef4f2c21a3fdb5a96311640f2a12d7-1123x632.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

These breakthrough initiatives encompass a diverse range of areas, offering innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges faced in the virtual space. From an innovative social media gamified approach and decentralized personal identification system to advanced infrastructure solutions for seamless interaction with the blockchain, these projects are paving the way for a more accessible, secure, and interconnected crypto ecosystem. As the world continues to embrace the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, these five projects stand out for their ambitious visions and disruptive approaches. With a shared commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible, they hold the potential to redefine how we engage with the digital realm and leverage the power of decentralized networks. In this exploration of the most noteworthy young projects in the crypto industry for 2023, we delve into the cutting-edge innovations that are shaping the future of finance, identity management, and decentralized applications. Cheelee Cheelee, a Web3 GameFi short video platform that rewards users for watching the feed, changes the way people make money on social media. Cheelee uses the Attention Economy concept to give everyone a new way of earning an income and a living wage, regardless of age, occupation, or socioeconomic background, and has the potential to redefine the social media industry while helping solve the problem of job automation by AI. ""Cheelee is a game-changing Web3 GameFi short video platform that reshapes the landscape of social media platforms and rebalances the power which was earlier concentrated in the hands of platform owners, bloggers and advertisers. Our platform is not just about watching short videos; it's about empowering users to become more active in their virtual journey,"" CPO Cheelee Yuriy Kardonov explains. To inspire new users to learn its money-making mechanisms, the app gives them a free pair of Starting Digital glasses. Users that upgrade these glasses can increase their initial investment by more than X2. Cheeleers manage to earn up to several thousand dollars monthly with this tool, as seen from their reports on the platform's socials. Cheelee is going to blow up in 2023 with its governance token, $CHEEL, which has been steadily increasing in value and shows great promise because of its limited supply, high utility, and possible access to almost 5 billion social media users around the world. Cheeleeis already available on App Store and Google Play. WorldCoin Meet Worldcoin, a unique cryptocurrency project with a mission to verify people's identities online and combat the problem of bots and fake virtual profiles created by AI. Their special system, Proof-of-Personhood, works by scanning your eyes to ensure you are who you claim to be, preventing multiple accounts and stopping fraud. ""A very central one is, how can you prove that you are a real human (not a bot) and have not yet claimed your free share of the currency, without revealing personal information about yourself like your name or email. Making this work in a scalable and fraud-proof way is hard,"" explains Alex Blania, co-founder of Worldcoin and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the project. Founded in 2019 by Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI), Max Novendstern, and Alex Blania, and supported by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Worldcoin uses a distribution method similar to universal basic income (UBI) to encourage users to join their network. They offer their cryptocurrency as a reward to users who get their iris scanned using Worldcoin's orb-shaped iris scanner. Worldcoin has been highly successful in raising funds, starting with $25 million in October 2021 and an additional $100 million in just six months, boosting the token's value to an impressive $3 billion. And they didn't stop there, announcing another $115 million in funding in May 2023. As of January 2023, Worldcoin celebrated reaching 1 million sign-ups, with more than 115,000 new users in December 2022 alone. Their user base is diverse, coming from various countries like Argentina, Chile, India, Kenya, Portugal, Spain, and Uganda. By July 2023, they expanded to over 2 million users, and their World App is rocking with over 500,000 monthly active users. Arkham Intelligence Introducing Arkham Intelligence, a company focused on blockchain intelligence. Their platform is designed to reveal information about the real-world entities and individuals connected to cryptocurrencies, giving valuable insights into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The goal is to remove anonymity from the blockchain and shed light on the identities behind cryptocurrency transactions. ""Our industry has been plagued with bad actors who survive by hiding in the shadows. Crypto intelligence brings them into the light, and that’s what our platform and our research have always done,"" Arkham CEO Miguel Morel tweeted. In July 2023, Arkham Intelligence launched a bounty marketplace, enabling people to buy and sell on-chain cryptocurrency data. To facilitate these trades, they introduced the ARKM token as the main currency on the Arkham Intelligence exchange. Currently, as of July 2023, the ARKM token is being traded at $0.75 with a market cap of $113 million. For example, two savvy users of the Arkham platform recently earned a substantial reward of nearly $6,000 for successfully uncovering Do Kwon's wallet. The initial request to track the wallets of the former head of Terraform Labs was placed on the on-chain data marketplace, Arkham Intel Exchange. Two online detectives took up the challenge and accomplished the bounty hunt with great success, providing evidence that several addresses indeed belong to the businessman. As a result, they were rewarded with 9519 ARKM tokens, equivalent to approximately $5971. Fetch.ai Fetch.ai is an open-source machine learning platform, decentralized and based on a distributed ledger. It offers secure access to AI for smart and autonomous services. They've also made Agentverse, a web3 virtual hub, letting users create autonomous agents easily, no matter their technical skills. The platform's smart ledger combines blockchain with direct acrylic graph (DAG) tech. Transactions can be assigned to different routes, forming a fragmented network. New routes can be created if existing ones get overloaded. Fetch.ai uses UPoW (useful proof-of-work/proof-of-beneficial work), a mix of proof-of-work, proof-of-stake, and other mechanisms. FET is the primary value exchange on Fetch.ai. It's essential for network exchanges, staking, and rewarding node operators. FET unlocks various operations on the network and acts as the main payment method. It's also needed to find, create, deploy, and train autonomous economic agents. Fetch.ai's disruptive nature stems from its ability to challenge the status quo in machine learning, blockchain technology, and decentralized applications, offering new solutions and possibilities that can potentially reshape industries and user experiences. Arbitrum Arbitrum, developed by Offchain Labs in 2018, is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Its purpose is to address the Ethereum network's limitations, like slow transaction speeds and high fees during busy times. By reducing work and data storage on Ethereum's mainnet(Layer 1 or L1), Arbitrum aims to decrease network congestion and transaction costs, enhancing the speed and scalability of Ethereum smart contracts. ""Our mission at Arbitrum is to scale Ethereum without compromising on security. Notice that we're focused on the result, not the tool. On the end, not the means,"" wrote Steven Goldfeder, co-founder and CEO of Offchain Labs. Arbitrum enables users to perform transactions off the main network, which are later verified and grouped before being added to the main chain. This process helps ease congestion and lower gas fees on Ethereum, benefiting decentralized finance (DeFi) projects like Sushiswapand Aave, which utilize Arbitrum to offer efficient swaps with lower gas fees. The platform supports the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing seamless integration with existing Ethereum tools and infrastructure for DeFi developers. To gain exposure to the Arbitrum network, individuals can consider the governance token, ARB. Holders of ARB tokens can participate in the protocol's decision-making processes, including proposing and voting on upgrades or changes. Additionally, ARB tokens are used to pay for transaction fees on the Arbitrum network. Despite being launched in March 2023, the ARB token has already reached a market capitalization of over one billion dollars. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Latest Earnings Report From MicroStrategy MicroStrategy, the largest independent publicly-traded business intelligence company, has announced its financial results for the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. One of the standout highlights of the report is MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings. The company has been steadily accumulating the crypto as part of its capital allocation strategy. Its co-founder and chairman, Michael Saylo,r has been a very vocal proponent of Bitcoin. He recently revealed that the company had acquired an additional 467 BTC for $14.4 million. The company had previously reported the purchase of 12,333 BTCs in the month of June. As of July 31, 2023, MicroStrategy held a staggering 152,800 bitcoins, acquired at a total cost of $4.53 billion, with an average price of $29,672 per bitcoin. Financial Performance in Q2 2023 Andrew Kang, the Chief Financial Officer of MicroStrategy, emphasized the importance of their bitcoin holdings in light of favorable factors such as increasing institutional interest, progress on accounting transparency, and ongoing regulatory clarity for bitcoin. MicroStrategy's gross profit for the second quarter of 2023 was $93.3 million, representing a gross margin of 77.5%. By reducing operating expenses by 88.2% from that of Q2 2022 and other significant changes in the company’s loss and revenue structure, MicroStrategy was able to bring in its digital asset impairment losses to $24.1 million for Q2 2023, compared to the significantly higher amount of $917.8 million in Q2 2022. MicroStrategy's Vision and Strategies In its latest earnings report, MicroStrategy spoke about its two corporate strategies: first, to acquire and hold bitcoin as a dependable store of value, and second, to grow its enterprise analytics software business to promote its vision of Intelligence Everywhere. The company views Bitcoin as an attractive investment and has been committed to increasing its bitcoin holdings over time. President and CEO Phong Le highlighted their new MicroStrategy ONE platform, saying, “Our new MicroStrategy ONE platform is the most important product innovation in the history of our company because it represents a fundamental shift in our industry to harness the power of business intelligence and artificial intelligence together to upgrade the way organizations do business.

15557163,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545469,1690977482,Binance Coin (BNB) Price Gears Up For A 10% Upswing – Here’s How,"Binance Coin (BNB) has recently exhibited a period of price consolidation, displaying a lateral movement within the range of $245 to $234 over the past two weeks. This intriguing price action has given rise to a bullish reversal pattern known as the inverted head and shoulders, hinting at potential future price movements. The inverted head and shoulders pattern is a popular technical analysis formation, often indicating a potential trend reversal. It consists of three main components: a low, followed by a lower low forming the “head,” and then another low resembling a “shoulder.” Related Reading: Curve DAO (CRV) Price Recovery Post-Exploit: What Would Be A Realistic Scenario? The crucial point of this pattern lies at the “neckline,” which is a horizontal resistance level connecting the highs of the head and the two shoulders. A breakout above this neckline is typically a bullish signal, indicating a potential price upswing. Source: Coingecko BNB’s Potential For Recovery And Growth The pattern signifies a shift from a downtrend to an uptrend, suggesting that selling pressure may be waning and buying interest could be building up. Currently priced at $244 according to CoinGecko, BNB has experienced a minute 0.4% increase in the past 24 hours, and a 3.8% increase over the last seven days. On the daily chart, BNB is currently trading in the $26K range at TradingView.com Analyzing the price action reveals the emergence of the aforementioned inverted head and shoulders pattern. If the buyers can successfully uphold this newly formed support level, it could pave the way for a potential 10% recovery, potentially propelling the price toward the upper trendline of the established channel pattern. Binance Expands Influence With Japan Launch In a significant move, Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has launched its Japan subsidiary – Binance Japan K.K. The inauguration of this platform introduces BNB to the Japanese market for the first time, contributing to a slight weekly price uptick. This expansion into Japan signifies Binance’s commitment to broader global outreach and adoption of its native token, BNB. Related Reading: Weeks of Prosperity: MKR Holders See Wealth Grow By Over 100% Amidst Price Boom Binance Coin’s recent price action, characterized by a tight consolidation range, has unveiled an inverted head and shoulders pattern. This technical indication, if validated, could usher in a trend reversal and a potential price surge. Additionally, Binance’s strategic expansion into Japan through its subsidiary launch has introduced BNB to a new market, underlining its prominence and potential for further growth. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, these developments may play a pivotal role in shaping BNB’s trajectory in the coming weeks. (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

42392797,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC3kl,1690975008,A New Bitcoin-Based Arcade Game Is Leaving a Mark on Gamers,"A relatively new platform is trying to expand bitcoin (BTC) usage – beyond trading or investments – by building games on the Bitcoin blockchain that offer payouts on wins, among other uses.  New Bitcoin City, which went live last week, currently offers casual games, board games, and strategy games on both web and mobile that run on Bitcoin. The platform also offers NFT auctions and a marketplace, all native to the Bitcoin network.  “We want to make Bitcoin as generalized as possible — usable for far more than just a currency,” said @punk3700, one of the developers at New Bitcoin City said in a post on the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. “We started first with Art, then AI, and DeFi is the natural next area to add.”  Bitcoin’s usage in DeFi applications has so far been limited to tokenized representations of bitcoin on other chains, such as Ethereum or Solana.  The introduction of “Bitcoin Request for Comment” (BRC-20) standards earlier this year has allowed developers to issue tokens and build DeFi applications on Bitcoin. This has spurred the development of digital artwork and meme coins built on Bitcoin in recent months.  @punk3700 previously built Trustless Market, a Uniswap fork on Bitcoin, amid the Ordinals protocol hype to jumpstart BRC-20 token activity on the blockchain. Shortly after launch, the protocol racked up daily volumes of $500,000, attracted over 2,000 users, and let liquidity providers earn a 2% cut on all swaps conducted on the network.  As such, New Bitcoin City developers say using blockchains keeps games and wins fair – unlike opaque online games which may tamper their mechanism behind the scenes and make it difficult for a player to amass big earnings.  Meanwhile, to combat Bitcoin’s infamous slow transactional speeds, New Bitcoin City developers built NOS, a layer 2 network, using an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) on top of Bitcoin – allowing for smart contract functionality, similar to Ethereum, and faster speeds. EVMs are the software environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts work.  Such developments are what the likes of @punk3700 say takes the ecosystem forward. “It’s best when we can combine the best of both worlds, i.e. Ethereum and Bitcoin, together, rather than pitch Ethereum versus Bitcoin,” he stated.",POSITIVE,BTC,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/08/02/a-new-bitcoin-based-arcade-game-is-leaving-a-mark-on-gamers,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2261f393d8ccf9aacf1a2becf22cc1bc978eb606-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Artificial Intelligence (AI) trading specialist, ""MensAi,"" is gaining attention for introducing a new paradigm in the trading field. With the recent launch of the AI trading bot called ""MensAi Bot,"" there is a growing expectation that AI will completely replace traders in the securities and cryptocurrency markets. MensAi is an automatic Ai trading bot that was first released on the global cryptocurrency exchange ""OKX Exchange"". Notably, it is based on raw data from OKX Exchange and has undergone AI training led by a group of experts from global corporations. The program specializes in portfolio tracking, management, and trade performance analysis. Its merit lies in its ability to autonomously select coins, expanding its capabilities beyond conventional trading bots. Furthermore, MensAi Bot's key feature is its expertise in machine learning AI for perpetual swaps, enabling it to perform both long and short trades. Its strength lies in conservative asset management, ensuring profitability while safeguarding investors' assets. As a result, it has been highly regarded as a valuable bot for novice investors. MensAi Bot performs specialized functions based on the vast big data of the exchange, including backtesting and paper trading using indicators and tools. MensAi emphasized the increasing role of AI in the virtual asset investment sector with the launch of MensAi Bot. As traditional trading bot functions, which were previously limited to use by a few financial institutions and experts, continue to advance, there has been a recent increase in the utilization by individual investors. An official from MensAi stated, ""Unlike conventional programs that automatically buy and sell at specific preset prices, AI has no predefined prices."" They added, ""The key is for AI to capture real-time fluctuations in the stocks or coins that need to be traded and place orders when it determines the optimal price."" In essence, AI-based trading involves no preset prices and continually monitors market fluctuations to maximize investor convenience by placing orders at the best price or profit potential. MensAi highlighted that even beginners can benefit from the trading bot, which repeatedly executes buy and sell actions based on familiar and well-known indicators. Representative indicators include MACD (Moving Average Convergence and Divergence),moving averages used for predicting stock prices, the golden cross known as a bullish signal, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and the volatility indicator, Bollinger Bands. Additionally, MensAi backed its claims with actual performance cases, stating that AI trading bots outperformed conventional programs. It asserted that, over the long term, the difference in profits can reach as high as 5 to 13 basis points (bps), which translates to significant amounts due to the large order volume in real performance. Regarding the potential of AI, a MensAi representative stated, ""Ultimately, AI is highly likely to surpass human capabilities in finding patterns in data and identifying trading opportunities. However, while humans will still be needed for decision-making in new environments or understanding the context of information, AI is already making a difference when considering factors like information processing time."" They added, ""Though individual trader performance may vary, comparing human and AI trading skills are incomparable. It's similar to the situation when cars were invented, but some people still continued using horse-drawn carriages.""

15555359,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545452,1690973924,Sell The News? Litecoin Traders Capitulate Ahead Of Today’s Halving,"On-chain data shows that Litecoin traders are showing signs of capitulation as the asset’s much-anticipated halving event is only a few hours away now. Is Litecoin Halving A Buy The Rumor, Sell The News Event? The “halving” here refers to a periodic event where Litecoin’s block rewards (that is, rewards that miners receive for mining blocks) are permanently cut down in half. This event takes place approximately every four years and the next one, which would be the third, is scheduled to happen in around five hours if data from the mining platform NiceHash is to go by. The LTC halving is only a few hours away now | Source: NiceHash This third halving event will reduce the cryptocurrency’s block rewards from 12.5 LTC to 6.25 LTC. Historically, these events have been important for the asset, as they mark points where the cryptocurrency’s production rate (which is nothing but the block rewards, as miners releasing these coins is the only way to mint new LTC) shrinks, and hence, the coin becomes more scarce. As these halving events are so significant, the market naturally speculates around them, leading to the coin experiencing volatility. In a new tweet, the on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed how the traders have been behaving in anticipation of today’s Litecoin halving. The data for the two indicators | Source: Santiment on X In the above graph, Santiment has attached the data of two metrics related to LTC: “social dominance” and the “ratio of on-chain transaction volume in profit to loss.” The former of these tells us what percentage of discussion on social media related to the 100 largest assets in the cryptocurrency sector is coming from Litecoin alone. Related Reading: Why Is The Bitcoin And Crypto Market Up Today? From the chart, it’s visible that this indicator has observed a large spike today, showing that investors are participating in a large number of discussions related to today’s halving. The other indicator keeps track of the ratio between the profit-taking and loss-taking volumes on the network. As displayed in the graph, this metric has taken a plunge below the 1 mark recently. The ratio being less than 1 implies that loss-taking is the dominant force on the market at the moment. The loss volume is not only more than the profit volume right now, but it’s actually outweighing it at a ratio of more than 2:1. Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is The Best Thing To Happen To Bitcoin, Mike Novogratz Says This extraordinary loss-taking may be coming from the investors who purchased coins ahead of the halving believing it to be a bullish event, but as Litecoin has only gone down lower recently, the holders have panicked and are selling at losses in an attempt to avoid going further underwater. The high social dominance of the asset may also likewise be because of FUD-related discussions blowing up. Based on these signs, it’s possible that Litecoin may be going through a classic “buy the rumor, sell the news” event. LTC Price At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading around $91, up 1% in the last week.

It says it invested in the startups earlier this year as part of a wider push to accelerate its vision around decentralized commerce and Web3. KX, the venture building arm of Kasikorn Business Technology Group, aims to become a key player in Thailand’s active Web3 scene, which has been aided by the huge popularity of cryptocurrency in the country. According to the 2022 Global Crypto Adoption Index by Chainalysis, Thailand is ranked 8th in the world in terms of crypto adoption and it has emerged as the home for a number of Web3 startups, thanks in part to its reputation as a hub for digital nomads. The investments in Magic and Transak are strategic, as part of KX’s plan to boost decentralized commerce in the region. Magic is an established crypto wallet-as-a-service provider that enables Web3 developers to create customized wallets, complete with onboarding tools and fiat on- and off-ramps. Meanwhile, Transak is a payment and onboarding infrastructure provider that makes it possible to acquire and sell crypto in a way that feels intuitive to Web2 users. It’s notable that both startups are focused on technology that makes it simple to bring new users into Web3, as per KX’s mission. Besides investing in promising Web3 projects, KX has also developed its own crypto applications. It’s the creator of one of the most popular NFT marketplaces in Thailand, known as Coral NFT, which makes it possible to buy digital assets with local currency. In addition, it has created an on-chain wealth management app called Bigfin. KX Venture Director Paul Thanaarmates Arriyavat said the investments in Magic and Transak underscore its commitment to shaping the future of decentralized commerce. “We are deeply invested in unlocking the true potential of the Web3 ecosystem, and by backing these trailblazing companies, we aim to nurture a digital landscape that is secure, compliant and accessible for all,” he said.

The silver to Bitcoin’s gold When Litecoin creator Charlie Lee read an article in 2011 about this new form of payment that was being used on the Silk Road at the time he was immediately intrigued, and set about copying many aspects of the Bitcoin code in order to produce his own blockchain which he called Litecoin. Litecoin, often called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, is still with us, and holders will celebrate its third halving event at around 15:08 UTC (16:08 BST). The mining rewards will be cut in half, leading to what founder Charlie Lee calls a “disinflationary” system. The Litecoin price history It can be argued that the Litecoin halving, although a disinflationary event, does not actually impact the price, at least not in the short term. At the time of the first Litecoin halving in August 2015 price remained flat, with the odd spike to the up or downside, all the way up until late March of 2017 when the first great hyperbolic rise in price began. Litecoin went from $4 to around $370 by the end of the year. A bear market then ensued, which took the price all the way back down to $21. Litecoin’s second halving in August 2019 happened as the price was on the way down to a double bottom which finally arrived at $23 in early March 2020. From here another hyperbolic rise took place which coincided with Bitcoin’s first double-top peak. Litecoin hit $413. However, whereas Bitcoin’s second top went even higher, the second Litecoin spike came short of $300 before both cryptos began their descent into the next bear market. This time, Litecoin looked to have bottomed at around $40. Since then the price has ground higher, turning the major resistance at $90 into support, and also the very critical 200-day moving average. Just as Bitcoin is battling to turn its own major resistance at $30,000 into support, Litecoin needs to now hold where it is, making a higher low, and potentially going on to make a higher high in the coming bull market. Litecoin certainly isn’t Bitcoin, but it does share many of its characteristics, and this latest halving will reduce supply by half, making it a lot more attractive for those looking for what might be seen as a cheaper alternative to Bitcoin.

Nonetheless, a shift in focus has occurred as altcoins, spearheaded by MKR, appear to overshadow this turbulence. Presently, the value of MKR on CoinGecko stands at $1,346, showing a noteworthy 9.1% surge within the past 24 hours, accompanied by an impressive week-long ascent of 18.0%. Related Reading: Curve DAO (CRV) Price Recovery Post-Exploit: What Would Be A Realistic Scenario? From mid-June, MKR has achieved an increase exceeding 115%. This growth has effectively diminished the proportion of investors encountering losses by a significant margin of 26%. MKR Price Report Reveals Sustained Accumulation, Whale Activity MKR has emerged as a notable hotbed of investor interest, with a recent price report shedding light on intriguing market dynamics. The journey of MKR’s price has been marked by a distinct trend of accumulation (see chart below) that has been underway since March, underscoring the growing interest and confidence among investors. Source: Santiment As the calendar flipped to June, the accumulation of MKR gained considerable traction. Notably, this month saw a strategic move by prominent investors, often called “whales,” who opted to divest a portion of their holdings. This strategic decision, seemingly aimed at capitalizing on profits, had the unintended consequence of temporarily affecting the supply. However, the cryptocurrency market is known for its intricate interplays, and MKR’s case was no exception. While whales reduced their holdings, more oversized wallet holders recognized an opportune moment and swiftly absorbed the newly available supply. This orchestrated shift in ownership demonstrated the agility and resilience of the MKR ecosystem. Resurging Interest In DeFi Tokens DeFi has recently witnessed a fascinating shift in dynamics, drawing attention from analysts and investors. Glassnode’s insightful observations highlight a distinct surge of interest in DeFi tokens sparked by lackluster performances within the ecosystem. The backdrop against which this resurgence unfolds is crucial to understanding its significance. The previous dip in DeFi token prices was undeniably attributed to a significant event – the release of a memo by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Maker (MKR) is currently in a positive trend, trading at $1,328 on TradingView.com This regulatory communication deemed approximately 68 tokens unregistered securities, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the DeFi landscape. Related Reading: Uniswap (UNI) Stays Afloat With 11% Gain As Rest Of Top 50 Coins Sink Amidst the tumultuous landscape, the resurgence of interest is indeed noteworthy. Glassnode’s analytical lens zooms in on this intriguing development, offering valuable insights into the changing sentiment.

42392811,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC4fB,1690966535,"Litecoin Halving Unlikely to Drive Immediate Price Gains, Past Data Show","Later Wednesday, Litecoin's blockchain will cut per block reward to 6.25 LTC from 12.5 LTC.  Litecoin's native token LTC was little-changed to negative for months following the previous two halvings.  The Litecoin Network, created in 2011 as a fork of Bitcoin, is set to implement its third mining-reward halving later Wednesday, reducing the pace of expansion in the supply of its native token, LTC.  Halving is a process by which the per-block reward given to miners in a crypto network for verifying transactions and adding blocks to the ledger is reduced by 50%. It's a feature in both the Litecoin and Bitcoin blockchains, which implement the halving roughly every four years. While traders might expect LTC to surge after cut takes effect due to the supply constraint, past data suggests otherwise.  Wednesday's change will reduce the per-block LTC reward to 6.25 LTC from 12.5 LTC and will probably happen around 15:11 GMT (11:11 am ET), according to the website litecoinblockhalf.com. Previous halvings occurred on Aug. 5, 2019, and Aug. 25, 2015. According to Litecoin founder Charlie Lee, these disinflationary halvings help achieve mass adoption without sacrificing network security.  However, litecoin's response to the previous two occurrences was anything but bullish.  Following the August 2015 halving, litecoin traded between $2.8-$3.6 for 19 months, before a breakout that coincided with the bitcoin rally and saw prices rise as high as $370 by December 2017. A somewhat similar pattern played out following the August 2019 halving.  Perhaps traders priced in the halvings in advance, as evident from the pre-event rallies, and then took profits before sitting on the fence for months awaiting a bitcoin bull run.  LTC's indifferent attitude toward the pivotal event could be explained by the fact that on both occasions, bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value and industry anchor, was nursing the after-effects of a brutal bear market. More importantly, crypto bull markets typically begin months after bitcoin's reward halvings, which occur 8-9 months after Litecoin's halvings. Bitcoin's fourth halving is due in March/April 2024.  At press time, LTC changed hands at $90.29, a 28.8% year-to-date gain.

15552318,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2023/08/tether-blacklists-scammer-after-20-million-usdt-heist,1690966320,Tether Blacklists Scammer After $20 Million USDT Heist,"A scammer managed to steal $20 million worth of Tether (USDT) on the 1st of August, using a zero transfer phishing attack. Tether immediately swung into action, blocking the scammer’s address and blacklisting them, all within an hour of the attack being orchestrated. Zero Transfer Attack Blockchain users have to always be on their guard when making on-chain transactions, primarily due to the threat of hackers and scammers. One such scammer managed to steal $20 million worth of Tether (USDT) by orchestrating a zero-transfer phishing attack. Most zero-transfer attacks operate using the same modus operandi. Hackers trick the user into sending a $0 transaction to a phishing address similar to an address the victim frequently transacts with or transfers funds to. Users typically check only the first and last few digits of a wallet address and ignore reading the complete address. This is the loophole that hackers are able to use, outsmarting the intended victim with a phishing address that looks similar to the original address. Users that don’t bother to check the whole address typically fall for such attacks. For example, if a user sends 100 coins to a particular address, the hacker could send 0 coins from the victim’s wallet to a similar address controlled by the attacker. The victim views the transaction in their transaction history and assumes that the address in question is the proper address and ends up sending the transaction to the phishing address instead. The Tether Attack Data from On-chain analytic firm PeckShield has shown that a scammer managed to grab $20 million worth of USDT using this type of attack. The intended address to which the victim wanted to send the funds was 0xa7B4BAC8f0f9692e56750aEFB5f6cB5516E90570. However, the scammer tricked the victim into sending the funds to another address, 0xa7Bf48749D2E4aA29e3209879956b9bAa9E90570, as shown by PeckShield in its analysis. Data shows that the victim’s wallet address initially received $10 million from a Binance account. This was sent to another address before the scammer jumped into the middle of the transaction, sending a fake Zero USDT transfer from the victim’s account to the phishing address in question. Following this, the victim inadvertently ended up sending 20 million USDT to the phishing address, thinking they were transferring it to the original address. “#PeckShieldAlert A #ZeroTransfer scammer grabbed 20M $USDT from 0x4071...9Cbc. Intended Address: 0xa7B4BAC8f0f9692e56750aEFB5f6cB5516E90570 Phishing Address: 0xa7Bf48749D2E4aA29e3209879956b9bAa9E90570.” Tether Swings Into Action Tether was extremely proactive in dealing with the scammer, almost immediately freezing the stolen funds by putting the scammer’s address on a blacklist. This was done barely an hour after the attack. Tether’s quick response has raised plenty of eyebrows regarding the victim’s identity, with on-chain sleuth ZachXBT tweeting his curiosity about the victim’s identity. “Curious who this would be if it were blacklisted within ~1 hr. Tether takes days to do that after obvious hacks but was acted here extremely quickly.” According to some members of the crypto community, the victim could be an influential individual or a very large firm. Zero transfer scams are becoming increasingly common in the crypto space over the past year. The first instance of a big zero transfer scam occurred in December 2022, with the ecosystem losing around $40 million to similar attacks since.

Gauntlet, which specializes in risk management, posted the proposal on Wednesday to the Aave community members, who have until August 5 to vote on the proposal.  “Gauntlet has been looking into the risk profile of 0x7a16ff8270133f063aab6c9977183d9e72835428. This account borrows roughly $54m of USDT against $158m of CRV, as of 2023/08/01,” the proposal read. “We recommend setting CRV LTV to 0 to help impede additional borrowing against existing CRV collateral due to the recent decrease in CRV liquidity.”  The loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is a measure comparing the amount of any collateral asset to the loan’s size. The higher the down payment; the lower the LTV ratio – and a zero LTV effectively means loans cannot be taken.  Curve Finance, a stablecoin swapping giant, suffered a Sunday exploit that drove down the price of the CRV token, putting a $168 million stash of founder Michael Egorov's money at risk of being liquidated.  This created bearish sentiment for the tokens among traders alongside concerns that liquidated assets would have to be sold into a market where prices are already falling. The liquidation of such a large position could have put pressure on other DeFi protocols because CRV is used as a trading pair and ballast in trading pools across the ecosystem.

The first ether futures ETF could go live on Oct. 12, if the SEC does not deny the application.  As many as six entities have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) for ether (ETH) futures-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs), following the bitcoin spot ETF hype some weeks ago.  First off the block was Volatility Shares Ether Strategy ETF application, which filed on July 28. Volatility Shares came into the spotlight in June, when its 2x Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITX) became the first leveraged crypto ETF available in the U.S.  By August 1, other companies had filed for the Bitwise Ethereum Strategy ETF, VanEck Ethereum Strategy ETF, Roundhill Ether Strategy ETF, ProShares Short Ether Strategy ETF, ProShares Ether Strategy ETF and Grayscale Ethereum Futures ETF.  Historically, the SEC has never approved any ETF applications tracking Ethereum futures contracts, though nearly 10 have been filed previously, a person familiar with the process told CoinDesk.  If the SEC doesn't deny the applications, the Ether ETFs will launch 75 days from the filing date and Volatility Shares would be the first on Oct. 12, with the others to follow.  The excitement in the crypto market around crypto-related ETFs was triggered after a wave of applications for spot-bitcoin ETFs came into focus, particularly after BlackRock first filed on June 15 and then refiled in early July with Coinbase as a surveillance-sharing partner.  ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF is first in the queue among the others including BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, Bitwise's Bitcoin ETP Trust, Fidelity's Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust, WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust, VanEck Bitcoin Strategy ETF, Invesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF and Valkyrie’s spot-bitcoin ETF.  Grayscale, which sued the SEC for denying its application to convert its trust product into an ETF, has said that the SEC should approve all spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications simultaneously if it approves any, to grant equal treatment to all applicants.

Curve had suffered a major exploit earlier in the week, leading to the protocol losing nearly $50 million to hackers. Chaos At Curve Finance Curve Finance suffered a major exploit earlier in the week, allowing hackers to siphon off nearly $50 million worth of crypto. This included CRV tokens worth $4.52 million, leading to a significant drop in the token’s price. The exploit resulted from a reentrancy bug in Vyper, the programming language powering parts of the Curve ecosystem. The CRV token saw a decline of nearly 20% following the attack. The markets were further spooked after reports emerged that the founder of Curve Finance, Michael Egorov, had allegedly taken several loans, using nearly 47% of the total circulating supply of CRV. Reentrancy attacks have become relatively common in the DeFi space. In such an exploit, hackers trick smart contracts by making repeated calls to the protocol and stealing user assets. As a result, Upbit has suspended deposits and withdrawals of the CRV token, while other exchanges have warned users to exercise caution when dealing with investments related to CRV. Upbit had tweeted, “Today, certain vulnerabilities have been discovered in some of the stablecoin pools associated with Curve (CRV). As a result, CRV is currently experiencing significant volatility. We advise exercising caution when considering any investments related to CRV. To ensure the safety of digital asset transactions, we have temporarily suspended deposits and withdrawals for CRV.” Curve And Egorov Find Support The plummeting CRV price significantly increased the risk of liquidating the loans Egorov took. However, prominent players from the crypto space have stepped in to assist Curve and Egorov. These include Power DeFi user DCF God, Tron Foundation CEO Justin Sun, and Jeffrey Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother. All have since stepped in and purchased CRV tokens from Egorov. As a result of this help, the principal value of Egorov’s loan dropped from $63 million to $54 million. Tron founder Justin Sun tweeted that he was excited to assist Curve, demonstrating his support for the protocol by acquiring a number of CRV tokens. According to available on-chain data, Sun purchased around 5 million CRV tokens worth around $3 million. The tokens were purchased from a wallet called the Curve.fi Founder, and was completed through an over-the-counter transaction. Sun tweeted, “Excited to assist Curve! As steadfast partners, we remain committed to providing support whenever needed. Our joint efforts will introduce an @stusdt pool on Curve, amplifying user benefits. Together, we aim to empower the community and forge a decentralized finance!” Other players that chipped in to assist Curve were Cream Finance, who sent Egorov $1 million in USDT and USDC stablecoins. Egorov also received $1.5 million worth of USDT from Jeffrey Huang (Machi Big Brother), according to data sourced from PeckShield. Egorov also transferred over 50 million CRV to other entities, including the Web3 investment firm DWF Labs and Power DeFi user DCF God. Going by these numbers, Egorov sold around 50 million CRV tokens at a price of around $0.4 per token, making the transactions worth close to $20 million. Major Implications For DeFi The Curve Finance exploit could have major implications for the larger DeFi ecosystem, with the CRV token’s value suffering a significant decline, putting Egorov’s $168 million lending position at risk of liquidation. If the position were to be liquidated, it could have a domino effect on the larger DeFi ecosystem. Egorov has a $70 million loan on Aave v2, for which he has used CRV as collateral. Additionally, he has also borrowed $17 worth of FRAX, putting $32 million worth of CRV as collateral, along with another $18 million loan from DeFi protocol Abracadabra. Concerns about the concentration of CRV on Aave were flagged by Gauntlet, who recommended freezing the token on Aave. “The amount of CRV concentrated on Aave, relative to the circulating supply of CRV, is already high. Given the limitations of V2 mechanisms, including the possibility of circumventing an LTV of 0, the only way to truly prevent more risk of this position is to prevent borrowing of all assets on V2.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

""The Government is concerned by the ongoing activities of an organization calling itself 'WORLD COIN' which is involved in the registration of citizens through the collection of eyeball/iris data,"" said the statement signed by Minister Kithure Kindiki.  Worldcoin is attempting to create a global identification mechanism based on iris scans, which can be used to prove that an agent is human and unique. In a world where artificially intelligent agents are participating in the economy, this could be crucial, the project says. But the collection of biometric data and the signup process in developing countries have drawn criticism, including accusations of exploitation.  Several European regulators have started investigations into Worldcoin, among them the Bavarian data protection office that supervises the firm, according to a statement sent to CoinDesk. Kenya, however, is the first country to go further and suspend the company's operations completely while local agencies investigate.  Users that have had their irises scanned have received WLD tokens since the project's launch last week. The token has risen 4.8% to $2.41 on crypto exchanges in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data.  Kenya's Capital Markets Authority also issued a ""cautionary statement"" on Wednesday. Neither the project nor the tokens are regulated by the authority, it said in an email sent to CoinDesk. The statement warned of ""potential fraudulent schemes that may emerge in the over-the-counter market of crypto tokens."" The CMA is willing to work with the company through its regulatory sandbox.

However, an unfortunate security breach occurred over the weekend, causing a significant decrease in both the total funds entrusted to Curve and the value of its native token, CRV, which serves as a means of transaction within the protocol. According to a report from Bloomberg, this decline in CRV’s price has put the substantial sum of over $100 million in loans at risk of being liquidated, posing a serious challenge for Curve Finance’s founder, Michael Egorov. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prospects: Can The Memecoin Climb To The $0.1 Level? As news of the potential liquidation of the Curve Founder’s assets spread, the sentiment among investors turned increasingly fearful, resulting in a notable impact on the CRV market’s price action in recent days. Many are now questioning whether there is any hope for a recovery. CRV price action in the last week. Source: Coingecko CRV Price Analysis: Mixed Trends Prompt Speculation On Sentiment According to CoinGecko, the price of CRV currently stands at $0.563, reflecting a decrease of -2.40% in the last 24 hours. Additionally, over the past seven days, CRV has experienced a significant decline of 22.1%. Despite the recent uptick, a bearish sentiment overshadows the CRV token’s prospects. Notably, a fundamental support level lies at the $0.5 mark, which underwent testing in November and December 2022. Furthermore, a potential positive price response might be witnessed at the $0.32 support level from October and November 2020. CRV is currently in the red, with a price of $0.563 on the daily chart on TradingView.com Unveiling Potential Shifts In Sentiment An intriguing observation comes from the CRV price report, highlighting a sudden spike in previously dormant Open Interest (OI) charts within the past 48 hours. This occurrence coincided with a period of losses for the Curve DAO token on the chart. A noteworthy development emerged during the recent rebound from $0.5 as the OI continued its ascent. This phenomenon raises the question: could this point to a direction toward bullish sentiment? Related Reading: The Litecoin $95 Question: Is A Bullish Breakout In The Pipeline?

Egorov Responds To Contagion Concerns Amidst CRV Incident Meanwhile, Egorov talked to Bloomberg in the same report, shedding light on his strategic approach to mitigate the impact of the ongoing liquidation threat. He shared his focus on diminishing the sizes of his loans as a precautionary measure. Speaking about the potential contagion effects of the situation, Egorov conveyed his perspective in an email to the publication: “I cannot comment much about contagion effects apart from saying that we, and I personally, work on minimizing or eliminating the impact,” he wrote. “In any case, I think we and all DeFi will come out stronger surviving this event.” (This site’s content should not be construed as investment advice.

15549903,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545390,1690960235,Why Is The Bitcoin And Crypto Market Up Today?,"Bitcoin (BTC) saw a significant resurgence over the past few hours after hitting the lowest price since June 21 at $28,641 yesterday. At press time, BTC has experienced a 3.7% hike from its low. In fact, BTC even brushed past the $30,000 mark, indicating a substantial shift in market sentiment. So, the question begs. Why Is Bitcoin Up Today? “The entire short build-up of the past couple days just got wiped,” tweeted analyst Byzantine General. Data from Coinglass backs this claim and shows that BTC short positions amounting to $27.8 million were liquidated yesterday, followed by an additional $13.45 million today. This accounts for the most significant short liquidation since July 14, undeniably playing a significant role in the current price movement. But perhaps the most influential reason for the sudden shift in market sentiment was MicroStrategy’s recent announcement. The company stated that it will conduct stock sales worth $750 million. After the announcement, the Bitcoin community was abuzz with speculation that Michael Saylor might make additional, gigantic BTC purchases. Related Reading: Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators “As with prior programs, we may use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, which include the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the repurchase or repayment of our outstanding debt,” said Andrew Kang, MicroStrategy’s CFO during a recent earnings call. While it remains unclear if the entire proceeds will be funneled into Bitcoin, the likelihood of a substantial chunk is certain. Directly after this announcement, Bitcoin surged by 1.6% within one hour. On-chain analysis firm Santiment tweeted: “Bitcoin has breached back above $30k once again, with assistance from the many traders who capitulated during the past week of price declines. Volume is rising to kick off August, & this psychological resistance cross may shift sentiment positive.” Related Reading: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink Is The Best Thing To Happen To Bitcoin, Mike Novogratz Says The chart shared by the firm shows that yesterday trading volume picked up steam again, rising to the highest level since six weeks. Also, the lowest amount of profit / loss taking in 7 months indicates a capitulation event. Analyst @52Skew added that the Bitcoin on the Binance spot market experienced a “real spot demand” which he wanted to see for a strong price reaction. “Note the limit bid wall that pushed up price; typical with PvP conditions to force limit chasing. Marked notable liquidity on the orderbook,” the analyst stated. What’s Next? However, he also cautioned that the 4-hour chart is so far looking like a classic Swing Failure Pattern (SFP) into a higher time-frame support / resistance. The Swing Failure Pattern, or SFP, is a type of reversal pattern where traders target stop-losses above a key swing low or below a key swing high to manipulate the price direction by generating enough liquidity. Nevertheless, the market appears to be brimming with anticipation. As per @DaanCrypto: “If price starts ranging here I’d look for another sweep of the lows and consolidation there. $28.5 & 29.5K are the areas of interest.” Meanwhile, a break above the resistance zone at the monthly and weekly open between $29,236 and $29,300 would validate a bullish scenario where the price targets $30,000. At press time, BTC wasn’t able to reclaim the red resistance zone and was trading at $29,606.

Registration should, in theory, make it easier to obtain the necessary registrations and permissions across the EU owing to the bloc's MiCA regulation.  Digital asset custodian Hex Trust has expanded its regulated footprint in Europe, winning registration from France's Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) and Autorité de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Résolution (ACPR).  The Hong Kong-based firm can now provide digital asset custody and the buying, selling and trading of digital assets in France as well as Italy. It received equivalent registration from Italy's Organismo Agenti e Mediatori (OAM) in June last year.  Hex Trust described registration in France as ""a significant milestone"" for its European expansion plans, in an emailed announcement on Wednesday.  Under new European Union laws set to take effect in 2024, exchanges and wallet providers licensed in one EU country such as the Netherlands – a more demanding process than registration that involves checks on governance and financial health – will be able to operate across the 27-nation bloc.  France has emerged as a favored destination for cryptocurrency firms, thanks to the country's welcoming stance towards the industry, with tax cuts on crypto profits and a simplified registration processes with financial watchdogs.

These channels allow two parties to lock up on-chain funds. It decreases network congestion by conducting several transactions separately and by then bundling every transaction into one when submitting to the main blockchain.

According to an initial report from Bloomberg, the incident occurred just as the firm reopened its platform, after months of court-led fundraising initiatives, to allow clients to retrieve any residual assets. During the 30-day window for withdrawal, customers managed to recover about $490 million in assets, accounting for nearly 80% of the available amount, Voyager's lawyer Darren Azman informed the presiding judge of the Chapter 11 case in Manhattan. This potential breach has since been reported to law enforcement agencies and is under investigation by bankruptcy officials overseeing the company's liquidation process. Clientts have reportedly been targeted with scams aimed at gaining access to their digital wallets. According to Azman, customers were targeted by several scams attempting to infiltrate their digital wallets. These scams typically involved the creation of fraudulent websites, promising customers an increased payout if they linked their non-Voyager cryptocurrency wallets to a newly created account. Upon creating these new accounts, the scammers would proceed to deplete the linked non-Voyager wallets, Azman explained. Presiding over the telephone-held court hearing, US Bankruptcy Judge Michael Wiles condemned the situation, stating: ""It’s disgraceful. I don’t know what to say. After everything these folks have been through."" Voyager is the first among a string of bankrupt cryptocurrency firms to commence the repayment of creditors and customers. In April, Binance.US nullified a deal to buy the cryptocurrency platform, which ultimately diminished what customers could recover. Voyager officials previously projected that customers could recuperate about 36% of what they were owed, or more than 60% if the company prevailed in a court dispute with another bankrupt cryptocurrency firm, FTX Trading. Based on court documents, Voyager possessed about $630 million to settle $1.8 billion in account claims. Launched sometime in 2018, Voyager rapidly expanded, peaking at 3.5 million users and holding approximately $6 billion worth of cryptocurrency assets, according to court records.

The note assumes significance as it's the official document that voices India's recommendations before the next iteration of framing global crypto rules – a synthesis paper jointly produced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Financial Stability Board (FSB). In July, the FSB individually called for tougher rules for crypto asset activities and global stablecoin arrangements.  The note revealed that the synthesis paper is expected at the end of August, less than two weeks before the G20 Leaders' Summit. On July 18, an IMF blog said the organization would deliver the synthesis paper at the Leaders’ Summit.  The note asks that the synthesis paper include action points such as promoting the effective implementation of the FSB's recommendations and all other standard-setting bodies. Additionally, the note asks that macro-financial implications and risks specific to Emerging Markets and Developing Economies are taken into account.  Other action points include conducting outreach to all jurisdictions to generate awareness of risks, starting with the regions which have seen higher adoption of crypto assets and involving non-G20 members and handing responsibility to coordinate the work around global crypto rules to the IMF and FSB.  News of the existence of such a note first emerged ahead of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) meeting in India last month through Ajay Seth, a senior official of the Indian Finance Ministry. Later, at the post-event media briefing, without revealing details of the note, Seth said ""(India) contributed its own note, it's the presidency note in the sense that we originated that idea (and) several other countries contributed.""

OKX Wallet will soon launch additional account-abstraction powered features, including social recovery functionality. This will enable users to select trusted ""guardians"" from their social network to help them recover their Smart Account if they lose their keys. OKX Wallet is one of the first wallets in Web3 with multi-chain account abstraction support. With Smart Account, users can now interact with multiple contracts in a single transaction. This enhances composability for advanced users and adds convenient features for beginners, creating a more user-friendly and intuitive wallet experience. OKX Chief Innovation Officer Jason Lau said: ""Our aim is to provide our users with the most accessible, secure, and powerful Web3 gateway. The Smart Account feature will play a significant role in achieving this goal. Account abstraction technology is a game-changer for the broader adoption of Web3 and enables new use cases and user experiences. We are excited to share more as we continue to build on top of this feature."" Account abstraction simplifies crypto transactions by enabling the creation of Web3 wallet accounts that conceal the more technical details of their on-chain interactions behind a more accessible and user-centric interface. This is achieved by combining users' smart contracts and Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) into a single ""smart"" account, providing a more unified Web3 experience. The account abstraction-powered Smart Account simplifies some of the complexities of blockchain transactions; for example, one of the biggest painpoints that users face is the need to navigate the complex transaction process and decipher technical terms such as 'gas fees' and 'Gwei.' Smart Account addresses this painpoint by reducing the number of steps required to complete a token swap or trade to just one click. OKX Chief Marketing Officer Haider Rafique said: ""We promised our customers and the larger DeFi community that we would prioritize security and interoperability as we build our Web3 wallet and apps. We support 60+ cross-chains, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), and now with Smart Account, we offer a stablecoin account that can interact with transactions on multiple blockchains without the need for a specific blockchain's native token, with a social recovery feature coming soon.

15547425,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545380,1690954254,Ethereum Denied Non-Security Status In Latest Court Battle Against SEC,"In a recent court ruling, Ethereum (ETH) was denied non-security status in a case against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The court granted the SEC’s motion to dismiss the complaint for declaratory relief on whether Ethereum and the Ethereum Network are securities. While the ruling was a procedural one and not on the merits, it confirmed that there is no protection for Ethereum as a non-security. Ethereum And Other Cryptocurrencies Left In Legal Limbo At this point in the US, only Bitcoin (BTC) and XRP are large-cap tokens that have legal clarity. The court’s decision highlights the regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies and the need for the SEC to issue definitive guidance rather than approaching the issue in piecemeal litigation. According to the Law Firm Dedicated to unique issues of digital assets and cryptocurrency, Hodl Law, the court emphasized that the SEC has not investigated the plaintiff or threatened to investigate, and there is no imminent threat based on its unclear Ethereum position and enforcement-by-litigation approach. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Dark Days Ahead As $29,200 Support Fails However, the SEC’s recent refusals to comment on Ethereum, combined with the position it was forced to take in this briefing, clearly demonstrate that it views Ethereum as a security and is waiting for the most opportune time to strike. While there are appellate options and constitutional grounds available, the ruling underscores the need for greater regulatory clarity in the cryptocurrency space. Businesses and individuals operating in the crypto industry need expert legal counsel to navigate the complex legal landscape and ensure compliance with applicable regulations. ETH’s Fate As A Security If the SEC were to classify Ethereum as a security, it could have significant consequences for the cryptocurrency and the broader industry. First and foremost, if Ethereum were classified as a security, it would be subject to the same regulations as traditional securities, such as stocks and bonds. This would mean that Ethereum would have to comply with securities laws and regulations, including registration requirements, disclosure requirements, and other compliance obligations. This would likely increase the cost and complexity of operating the ETH network and could potentially stifle innovation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Are The Tightest Ever, What Happens Next? Additionally, it could impact the value and liquidity of the cryptocurrency. The SEC’s classification would create uncertainty and potentially undermine investor confidence in Ethereum, leading to a decline in its value and potentially reducing demand for the cryptocurrency. Furthermore, this case could potentially lead to legal action against the platform and its developers. If the SEC were to determine that Ethereum was sold in violation of securities laws, it could result in penalties and fines for the platform’s founders and developers. As the crypto industry continues to evolve, regulators must provide clear guidance on the status and treatment of cryptocurrencies. The ongoing confusion and uncertainty surrounding the legal status of Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies pose significant challenges for businesses and investors in the space. While the court’s ruling, in this case, maybe disappointing for some, it underscores the need for greater clarity and regulatory certainty in the cryptocurrency industry. As of the time of writing, ETH is in the process of recovering from a significant decline experienced over the past few days. Currently, the second-largest token in the nascent industry is trading at $1,850, which represents a 0.7% decrease in the last 24 hours.

Starting November 1, GameStop will withdraw its iOS and Chrome Extension wallets, designed to manage cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). As part of this move, the firm has advisred users to ensure they have access to their secret passphrases by October 1. Launched in May 2022, these digital wallets were a part of GameStop's foray into the realm of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. A notable shift from its traditional business model, GameStop, which is well known for its brick-and-mortar stores that offer trade-ins of used consoles and games, has been striving to tap into digital asset-based growth opportunities. GameStop previously partnered with blockchain startup Immutable X earlier in 2022 to work on the NFT marketplace, leveraging Immutable X's Ethereum-based layer-2 protocol, which promised a carbon-neutral environment, high transaction rates, and the elimination of gas fees, thus enabling affordable, faster, and nearly limitless transactions. This joint venture also led to the creation of a $100 million fund, designed to empower game developers and studios to build on the new NFT marketplace. The initiative allowed developers to engage in seamless trading and minting of NFTs, with the added assurance of securre transactions. The retailer's entry into the crypto world followed the company's unexpected surge into the media spotlight in January 2021, when retail investors on Reddit triggered a short squeeze, causing significant losses for hedge fund managers. The incident has since prompted GameStop to launch its NFT marketplace and explore Web3 applications to bolster growth. The specifics of the ""regulatory uncertainty"" cited by GameStop remain unclear. Being headquartered in the United States, the firm operates in a jurisdiction where lawmakers and regulators have diverse views on crypto and blockchain. Notably, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently ramped up its legal actions against crypto firms, resulting in several ongoing lawsuits between blockchain companies and their executives. GameStop's decision to pull its digital wallets from the market comes amid these increasingly complex regulatory challenges, emphasizing the influence of regulatory landscapes on businesses operating within the crypto space.

15545874,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=545373,1690950604,Bitcoin Addresses In Loss Soar To One-Month High Amid Mixed Market Indicators,"Bitcoin, the pioneering cryptocurrency, is currently exhibiting mixed market signals, according to the latest data from Glassnode. The analytics firm points out that Bitcoin addresses in loss have reached a one-month high, even as the count of addresses holding smaller balances of the coin marks a record high. The contrasting trends paint an intriguing picture of the current state of the Bitcoin market, further spurring dialogues on the future trajectory of this digital asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast: Dark Days Ahead As $29,200 Support Fails BTC Addresses In Loss Reaches New Heights Glassnode’s report reveals earlier today that the number of Bitcoin addresses in loss (seven-day Moving Average) has peaked at roughly 14.043 billion, marking a new one-month high. This supersedes the previous peak of 14.041 billion recorded on July 31, 2023. Such a trend points towards a section of investors who bought BTC at higher price points and are now in the red due to the recent price fluctuations. However, it’s important to note that these losses are only ‘unrealized’ and turn ‘real’ only when the Bitcoin is sold. While a high number of addresses in loss might initially signal negativity, they can also indicate potential price recovery as these addresses might be waiting for prices to bounce back. Bitcoin Addresses With Smaller Holdings On The Rise In contrast to the increasing number of addresses in loss, Glassnode reports that the number of Bitcoin addresses with 0.01+ coins has attained a new all-time high (ATH) of 12.2 million. This suggests a broadening distribution of Bitcoin among retail investors, perhaps indicative of an increasing acceptance and adoption of the cryptocurrency. Adding another dimension to the market’s mixed signals, the number of non-zero Bitcoin addresses has also reached an all-time high of 47.9 million. This growth underscores the expanding base of Bitcoin holders, reflecting the coin’s widespread global adoption. Related Reading: Why This Billionaire Continues To Advocate For Bitcoin Amid Surging US Debt? While these trends unravel, BTC’s price has found itself in a rebound after a decline of nearly 5% in the past month. Particularly, the asset has seen a slight increase of 0.2% in the past 24 hours bringing its current price to trade at $29,375 after trading below the $29,000 mark earlier today. BTC’s market capitalization has also recorded more than $6 billion in loss in just the past week. The asset market cap has plunged from a high of $575 billion earlier last week to a current cap of $568 billion. Interestingly, Bitcoin’s trading volume has traced quite a contrasting path over the same period. Instead of following the trend of the recent falling BTC price, trading volume has been on a slight uptrend. Last week, the trading volume was stuck at $10 billion. However, in stark contrast to the price trend, this volume experienced a surge, peaking at $13 billion in just the past 24 hours. This suggests a heightened market activity, despite the dwindling Bitcoin price.

On August 1, the company’s bankruptcy administrators confirmed rumors of a relaunch by filing a draft plan of reorganization in which it proposes the kick-off of a “rebooted” offshore exchange exclusive to non-U.S. users only. Related Reading: FTT Flies 45% On Rumors Of FTX Planned Relaunch FTT Gains By 17% Amidst Plans To Terminate Claims FTT, native token of the FTX exchange, recorded a significant boost in its price on the emergence of the exchange’s proposal to relaunch in the international market. According to data by CoinMarketCap, FTT rose by 17% on Tuesday, moving from $1.34 to $1.59. Thereafter, the token experienced a decline, falling as low as $1.42, but has been climbing back up since then. Interestingly, FTT’s gain today has occurred amidst the exchange’s plans in relation to its native token. According to the draft plan of reorganization, FTX stated intentions to cancel all FTT claims as a result of their “equity-like characteristics.” The statement read: ….claims by holders of FTT (whether or not held on any FTX exchange), preferred stock, and equity investors in the Debtors and related claims. All these claims and interests will be canceled and extinguished as of the Effective Date, and holders will not receive any distribution. At the time of writing, FTT is trading at $1.45, having gone up by 7.39% in the last day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is up by 378.65% and is now valued at $43.8 million.

Those who use FTX.com exchange will be referred to as Dotcom customers, while FTX U.S. customers will be placed in the U.S. Customer Pool. This approach is aim at helping FTX better organize its customer data and provide more efficient service to its valued clients. In regards to the settlement of Dotcom creditors, FTX proposes that debtors may partner with third-party investors to set up a new exchange that will operate as an offshore platform. Alternatively, this exchange can also be formed as a merger or “similar transaction.” Thereafter, the debtors may then choose to grant the Dotcom customer pool some share of the company instead of conducting a full cash settlement. A statement from the draft read: Rather than all cash, the Debtors may determine that the Offshore Exchange Company remit non-cash consideration to the Dotcom Customer Pool in the form of equity securities, tokens, or other interests in the Offshore Exchange Company or rights to invest in such equity securities tokens or other interests (“Take-Back Interests”). Talks concerning an FTX.com relaunch began as early as January, with the company CEO, John J. Ray III, stating he had authorized a team to explore that possibility. In June, WSJ reported that the company had begun discussions with potential investors in a bid to meet the goal.

Although the regulator is yet to accept the filing, CEO Larry Fink has also made some supportive comments, comparing BTC to digital gold. In light of these events, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has come forward to share his opinions on BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and how he affects the digital asset. BlackRock CEO’s Pivoting Sentiment Toward Bitcoin Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz has stated that BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink’s change of heart is the best thing to happen to Bitcoin. “I think the most important thing that happened this year in Bitcoin is Larry Fink,” Novogratz mentioned during an interview on Bloomberg TV with David Rubenstein. Related Reading: USDT Issuer Tether Reports A 30% Decline In Profit Novogratz believes Fink’s acceptance of Bitcoin highlights a shifting sentiment towards Bitcoin and other digital currencies worldwide. According to him, “180 million people around the world, without a gun to their head, take their hard-earned savings and store it in this community of people that run this technology, you know, called bitcoin.” He further opined that Fink’s change of heart, alongside the increasing adoption of cryptocurrencies, could help Bitcoin surpass its all-time high of $69,000 recorded in 2021. Blackrock’s CEO Larry Fink was long known to be a skeptic of cryptocurrencies as he once went as far as tagging BTC an “index of money laundering.” “Bitcoin just shows you how much demand for money laundering there is in the world,” Fink stated in 2017. BTC price continues to fall as it trades at $28,789 | Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview.com However, there has been a change of heart from the CEO as earlier in June, BlackRock filed an application to the SEC to establish a Bitcoin spot ETF, a move that saw some other institutions file a similar application. In fact, in a show of support for cryptocurrencies, Fink stated that crypto, especially bitcoin could “revolutionize finance.” During an interview with Fox Business, he stated: “We do believe that if we can create more tokenization of assets and securities – that’s what bitcoin is – it could revolutionize finance.” Regulatory Environment Far From Certain Novogratz also noted Ripple’s recent victory over the SEC, with a judge ruling that the XRP token isn’t a security when sold on secondary exchanges. The Galaxy Digital CEO believes the court’s decision highlights the fact that regulators are still not familiar with the crypto space, and regulations from these regulators “are nowhere close to clear.” Related Reading: US Presidential Candidate Defends Bitcoin, Calls Out Environmental Critics The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has, so far, continued to label many cryptocurrencies as “securities” and filed separate lawsuits against different crypto exchanges and firms for allowing the trade of “unregistered securities.” However, if the recent ruling is anything to go by, it is obvious that the regulators are mistaken, and there is a need for the US Congress to enact crypto-related laws for stakeholders (including regulators) to gain more clarity on how to navigate the industry regulatory-wise.

Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin is shrugging off a downgrade of U.S. Government debt by Fitch.  Insights: How quickly times change. Bitcoin dominance sagged in July after rising in June.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Bitcoin Bounds Over $30K After Debt Downgrade, MicroStrategy Filing  Both bitcoin and ether are beginning the Asia trading day in the green, with the world’s largest digital asset up 2.2% and ether up 0.8% as markets in the East open in the red after Fitch downgraded the U.S’. long-term ratings to AA+ from AAA.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) is up 1.43% to 1,286.  This downgrade comes at a time when companies are reporting relatively positive earnings, which is why the market doesn’t seem to be as panicked as it was in 2011 when S&P downgraded U.S. debt.  In the middle of Q2 2023 earnings season, the S&P 500 has seen a greater proportion of companies reporting positive earnings surprises, according to Factset. This is in contrast to 2011, where stocks generally performed poorly, and news of the then-downgrade caused a panic.  Back in 2011, bitcoin wasn’t really a mature asset class, and there wasn’t at the same trading volume making the quality of correlation to macroeconomic events poor.  But how did it perform when the downgrade happened?  Mixed. On August 6, 2011, it was down 33% to $6.6, but the next day it jumped by 20% to $7.9. Although, between the two days, there was only $200,000 in trading volume.

Groth tied the trend reversal to an absence of the sort of catalysts that drove bitcoin's price dramatically higher in June, and Ripple's partial win last month in an ongoing court case with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that buoyed altcoin investors. The decision in U.S. federal court found that the sale of Ripple’s XRP tokens on exchanges and through algorithms did not constitute investment contracts and raised hopes that the SEC could not deem other tokens as securities.  ""What it basically did was allowed for a lot of the altcoins to catch up with where bitcoin was, and even Etherium relative to the small cap universe,"" Groth said.  In the days following the ruling, Coinbase, Kraken and other exchanges re-listed or announced plans to reopen trading of XRP and trading of the token mushroomed. Meanwhile, bitcoin slogged steadily downward to finish July off at 5%, the second monthly decline in an otherwise upbeat year. The BTC dominance rate in July sank below 49% in July after rising over 52% near the end of June. The CoinDesk Market Index was off only about 1%.  ""That was really driven by the computing sector, DeFi and digitalization, which have small tokens relative to currency and smart contract platforms where bitcoin and Etherium reside,"" Groth said.

42392791,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgC3QF,1690940657,U.S. DOJ Has 'Extremely Thin' Basis for Jailing FTX's Bankman-Fried Ahead of Trial: Defense,"Sam Bankman-Fried has not tried to tamper with witnesses, and the U.S. Department of Justice's allegations that he had ""mischaracterizes"" the reality, a filing by the FTX founder's defense team said.  The ex-CEO of the crypto exchange faces potential jail time ahead of his trial later this year, if the DOJ wins its motion to revoke his bond.  Attorneys for Sam Bankman-Fried pushed back against the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) motion to remand the FTX founder into custody in a court filing Tuesday, saying it relied on an ""extremely thin"" factual basis.  The DOJ has ""jumped to conclusions"" about Bankman-Fried's conduct, the filing said, which also pushed back against government arguments that he had pushed the boundaries of his bond release on multiple prior occasions.  ""The Government is wrong. Its version of events mischaracterizes the facts and removes them from their proper context to cast Mr. Bankman-Fried’s actions and intentions in the most negative light possible,"" the filing said.  Prosecutors alleged that Bankman-Fried had shared former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison's personal diary with the New York Times in an attempt to harass her and potentially tamper with her testimony as a potential witness in his criminal trial in October 2023.  During a hearing last week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon said the DOJ was seeking Bankman-Fried's detention, an argument her team reiterated in a written submission on Friday.  ""The defendant’s leaking of Ellison’s private writings is yet another instance of the defendant trying to intimidate and corruptly persuade Ellison with respect to her upcoming trial testimony, as well as an effort to influence or prevent the testimony of other potential trial witnesses by creating the specter that their most intimate business is at risk of being reported in the press,"" the DOJ said in the filing.  The DOJ's argument did not show that Bankman-Fried was trying to intimidate Ellison, the defense filing said.  ""The reporter contacted Mr. Bankman-Fried about an article he was already writing that featured Ms. Ellison’s personal diaries and writings. The reporter was already aware of these documents because he had written an article two months earlier in which he described Ms. Ellison’s writings and reported that they contained her 'raw reflections on SBF' and her 'personal and professional resentment' towards him,"" it said.  The DOJ had also pointed to Bankman-Fried's previous reach-out to FTX.US's general counsel, Ryne Miller, to ""vet things with each other"" as another example of alleged witness tampering.  In its response, Bankman-Fried's attorneys said that in reality, Miller had initiated the conversation with him, sharing a limited number of screenshots of Signal messages as evidence. The initial set of messages date back to Nov. 10, 2022 – prior to Bankman-Fried's arrest – and a second page of messages does not specify what date they were sent. A second exhibit shows Miller connecting Bankman-Fried with current FTX CEO John J. Ray III's team.  Another exhibit contains the actual message the government found fault with, which Bankman-Fried appears to have sent via both email and Signal.  Bankman-Fried's attorneys also argued that his use of a virtual private network – the use of which both the DOJ and the judge overseeing the case questioned – was innocuous, and that the DOJ had no evidence of wrongdoing.  The defense team further argued that locking Bankman-Fried up would deprive him of the ability to build a strong case, citing working conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he may be held.  Bankman-Fried faces seven different charges, including securities and wire fraud allegations, facing a trial currently scheduled to kick off in October. Another trial, set for March, will see the DOJ try Bankman-Fried again on another five charges, including conspiracy to commit bank fraud. He was arrested in December and extradited to the U.S., where he was released on bond while subject to a strict set of bail conditions.  The DOJ also announced last week that it had dropped a campaign finance charge, citing treaty obligations.

According to on-chain data from @WhaleAlert, an Ethereum whale transferred 2.4 trillion SHIB tokens worth $18.7 million from Binance.US into an unknown wallet. With the price of the token up by 10% since then, the whale’s SHIB holding is now valued at more than $20 million. These massive SHIB withdrawals can be traced to the announcement of the Layer 2 blockchain, Shibarium, which is expected to help minimize gas fees and increase the transaction speeds of the blockchain. Token price falls to $0.00000821 | Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview.com While there’s still no official launch date for Shibarium yet, the high rate of withdrawals likely signals that SHIB investors are reducing the selling pressure and want to hold their tokens in private wallets in hopes of what the Shibarium launch might bring. Withdrawals From Exchanges Reduces Selling Pressure On SHIB When SHIB is withdrawn from exchanges, it can’t be readily sold. This reduces the available supply of SHIB for sale, putting upward pressure on the price. When whales transfer such high amounts into self-custody, it frequently results in massive price changes and a rise in interest from other investors. This flurry of withdrawal into self-custody demonstrates the strength of the SHIB community and their faith in SHIB’s future. Related Reading: Is It A Good Idea To Buy Curve Now? Here’s What This Founder Thinks The meme-inspired token has gained quite a lot of community and has led the entire crypto industry in gains for the past two weeks. Shibarium’s launch is anticipated and SHIB holders want to make sure they capitalize on everything the new scaling solution will offer. At the time of writing, SHIB’s market cap is nearing $5 billion after it recently retook the 14th position by market cap. The meme coin is trading at $0.000008314 and is up by 7.55% in the past seven days.

A person familiar with the matter told the outlet that the board of directors of Binance.US, the U.S. affiliate of the massive exchange, voted on whether to liquidate the company but could not come to a unanimous decision, with Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder blocking the decision. Zhao serves as chair for the Binance.US board of directors.  A spokesperson for Binance.US did not have a comment when reached by CoinDesk.  Binance has been under heightened regulatory scrutiny in recent months over the handling of its global operations. Earlier this month, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Binance, Binance.US and CZ, alleging that the companies operated as an unregistered securities exchange. And in March, U.S. regulator Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) sued Binance and Zhao over allegations that the company knowingly offered unregistered crypto derivatives products in the U.S.  According to reports, Binance has conducted massive cuts to its staff as it mounts a response to the ongoing lawsuits.

The company announced today a world-class investor group comprising 500 Global, CMCC Global, Consensys Mesh, Bixin Ventures, BlackPine, DWeb3, Hard Yaka, Bored Room Ventures, Mozaik Capital, and others. The company aims to replace centralized data storage that deprives users of privacy and saddles enterprises with compliance and security issues and their associated costs. Terminal 3 leverages decentralized storage and zero-knowledge proofs to empower an equitable Web3, where user data is freely composable while remaining fully private and secure. “The continued growth in blockchain allows us to reimagine digital data ownership and security,” said Gary Liu, CEO of Terminal 3. “We believe that data should flow freely between applications to drive innovation and improve user experience, but not at the expense of personal privacy and control.” Terminal 3 was co-founded by Gary Liu alongside his partners Malcolm Ong (CPO) and Joey Liu (COO). All three were former entrepreneurs and business leaders who have built, scaled, and transformed some of the world’s leading technology companies. The co-founders previously worked together at the South China Morning Post, where they led the historic newspaper’s successful digital transformation. Gary was the Post’s CEO, while Malcolm and Joey were SVP of Product and Head of Strategy respectively. Malcolm was also the Co-founder and CTO of Skillshare, the world’s largest online learning community for creativity, while Gary and Joey co-founded Artifact Labs, a Web3 startup backed by Blue Pool Capital and Animoca Brands that is preserving historical assets on the blockchain. Gary is also the Founding Chair of Web3 Harbour, an association in Hong Kong serving Web3 builders, investors, users, and leaders. “I believe Gary, Malcolm, and Joey are perfectly suited to address data privacy problems that plague the internet,” said Vishal Harnal, Managing Partner at 500 Global. “Their mix of consumer startup success and expertise in enterprise technology could help bridge a critical gap between the old world of centralized data and the new world of decentralized identity.” Growing Need for Alternative Data Infrastructure Over the past five years, new regulations on data privacy have created a stringent environment for the storage and use of personal information worldwide. Led by Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), global regulators and lawmakers are increasingly holding enterprises accountable for the protection of individual privacy. This trend is set to continue with the approval of the Digital Market Act in Europe and upcoming GDPR-inspired laws in the United States and around the world. US and UK corporations have spent over US$9 billion on GDPR compliance since 2018, with those investing incurring average costs of US$1 million annually. However, over 40% of companies still lack any budget for such compliance while GDPR fines continue to grow, with Meta alone sustaining over US$2.3 billion in penalties. Data security is also a costly enterprise concern as data breaches accelerate in frequency. Global spending on data security and risk management products is projected to exceed US$188 billion in 2023. However, in a world where 90% of companies rely on multi-cloud environments, data privacy and security issues will grow regardless of investment. Blockchain technology is increasingly viewed by corporate executives as a solution for user data privacy and security. In a recent survey of US Fortune 500 companies, Coinbase found that 51% of enterprises that use or plan to use blockchain employ the technology for ‘Data Collection and Management’. “Terminal 3 is a compelling alternative to the non-compliant and unsecured data infrastructure that enterprises rely on today,” said Shawn Cheng, Partner at Consensys Mesh. “Data regulations and security laws are becoming more stringent around the world, and companies are finally realizing that self-sovereign data is a great solution for both users and enterprises. We are excited to be involved in this important project.” “Scaling Web3 will require the re-invention of core enterprise technologies,” added Gary Liu. “Terminal 3 is building solutions that serve both corporations and individuals, to enable this critical shift in our digital world.” About Terminal 3 Terminal 3 is a Hong Kong-based Web3 startup building user data infrastructure for a decentralized future.
