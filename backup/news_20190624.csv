42430651,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdPh,1561419928,Scammers Target Would-Be Libra Crypto Buyers With Fake Site,"Several exploitative websites launched over the weekend aiming to separate credulous Libra investors from their cash.  Though Libra has not seen its public debut, the media buzz around it has piqued some would-be investor’s attention. While the majority of searches around buying Libra are focused on how to exchange it for BTC, according to Google Trends and Reddit, some nefarious scammers are hoping to ensnare the hapless trader in a supposed Libra pre-sale.  One site, calìbra.com, (note the ì) is a mirror image of Facebook’s legitimate website, calibra.com, as noted by The Next Web's Hard Fork.  The artifice begins by switching the normal English i for a a grave accent ì. Those unfamiliar with Alcozauca Mixtec, Italian, Sardinian, Taos, Vietnamese, Welsh, Scottish Gaelic or the constructed language Na'vi, may have the unicode character – that Hard Fork reporter Matthew Beedham confused for a bit of dust.  Most prominently, the false site is allegedly offering ""Pre-Sale Libra Currency"" ahead of the official launch -- something that Facebook itself hasn't expressly announced. Specific prices include 600 ""LBR"" for 2 ETH, and 8,000 LBR for 20 ETH. This pre-sale buy option is placed in the same spot as the ""Get Started"" button on the official Libra page.  The website itself presents a range of differences when compared alongside Libra's official page. Similar components, including the actual text on the page, make them seem the same, but the fraudulent one itself looks a bit less polished.  Lighter ideas (but not scams)  While this particular scam – hosted in Russia, no less – is an obvious ploy to capitalize on the general incoherence of Facebook’s plan, some of the chicanery put online is of a more derisive sort.  Zuckbucks.cash offers visitors the option to swap ethereum for ZBUX, “an ERC20 token which can be used to do absolutely nothing.”  “Want to buy a cup of coffee with your ZBUX? Too bad! Need to pay your bills? Better use another currency! Want to pile on to Mark Zuckerberg's already incredibly overinflated bank account? Now we're getting somewhere!,” according to the website.  Indeed, if Facebook is behind zuckbucks, it surely would be the quickest and most convenient way to “feed Mark Zuckerberg’s insatiable greed.”  The masterminds behind zuckbucks promise to spend the funds they collect on gas and kick the remaining balance up to the dev-team. They write, “Just like LIBRA, Zuckbucks offers no inherent benefit besides putting your money directly into the pocket of the developers.”  Of the 1.5 million ZBUX available, 961,845 are currently in circulation.

In other words they're sequencing your weed's DNA and sticking it onto the blockchain.  ""The biotrace system provides seed-to-sale traceability for cannabis and hemp and uses Applied DNA’s unique, safe and persistent molecular tag for the identification of any biomass, extraction, isolate, derivative or cannabis packaging,” said CEO Jason Warnock in a release. “Collaborating with TruTrace connects the dots with an information platform linking the provenance of material, testing information and patient data that is so vital to the safety and efficacy of the global market.”  The company has been working to ensure that the weed or oil you take in is legal and traceable and they have a number of products that shows how weed travels via live maps. To that end they have added these DNA tags to TruTrace Technologies blockchain-based StrainSecure database. The company began as BLOCKStrain and is based in Vancouver, British Columbia. It is currently traded over the counter and it does not have a token.  This partnership is, as one would assume, a no-brainer. Connecting DNA tags to the blockchain is one of the interesting ways to track almost any type of consumable - from food to candy to ganja - from farm to bowl. Interestingly, the system also protects a farmer's intellectual property by ensuring genomes are traced.

Israeli news outlet Ynet reports the two allegedly stole over $100 million in cryptocurrency.  The infamous Bitfinex theft of 119,756 BTC shocked the crypto market with the largest loss of bitcoins by an exchange since the Mt. Gox breach in early 2014.  Earlier this month, some of the stolen bitcoin were recorded moving from wallets connected with the hack, after three years of lying dormant.  Israeli crime news portal Posta reported that several several cyber units across the globe are cooperating in an effort to retrieve the missing funds. The majority of compromised accounts were from users in the U.S. and E.U. In February, Bitfinex announced that some of the stolen bitcoin – 27.66270285 – were returned after being retrieved by the U.S. government.  The Gigi brothers Eli, 31, and Assaf, 21, also allegedly constructed a phishing scheme that involved luring investors from crypto trading forums, such as Telegram or Reddit, onto websites that mimicked prominent crypto exchanges. They would collect the traders’ login and wallet information and use it to transfer the funds stored on legitimate exchanges to their own accounts.  Police allege they may have used other tactics as well, including dropping links to wallet management software that once downloaded would allow access to the victim’s funds.  During a raid of Eli’s house the Israeli police seized one of his crypto wallets, which contained less than the suspected total of stolen funds. They also found two luxury cars.  Eli is a former computer science expert in the IDF, which one reddit user said “would be Unit 8200, the largest military branch in the Israeli army. It specializes in hacking, spying and creating computer viruses (Stuxnet) - many of them are now employed by Google, Microsoft and Coinbase.”  Eli said in court, as reported by Posta, ""I was wrong, I came from a bad place. I'm a good boy, and I'm sorry. I'm willing to cooperate.”  The investigation, which began in 2017, is ongoing.

The exploit, detailed by ZDNet, was a remote code execution attack that could force machines running Firefox to install spyware to capture passwords and other data.  The two vulnerabilities - CVE-2019-11708 and CVE-2019-11707 - first appeared in April 15 and hackers used them to spear-phish Coinbase employees. When they visited sites linked in the email the browser would download a piece of spyware to steal logins and other data.  Some detail from the exploit suggests that the bug could escalate privileges outside of the ""sandbox"" where most Mozilla code runs:  Insufficient vetting of parameters passed with the Prompt:Open IPC message between child and parent processes can result in the non-sandboxed parent process opening web content chosen by a compromised child process. When combined with additional vulnerabilities this could result in executing arbitrary code on the user's computer.  The two vulnerabilities combined to create a perfect storm, allowing hackers to run malware installers instantly. Researchers discovered the exploits on April 15 and they suspect that hackers saw them in Mozilla's Bugzilla bug tracking database and exploited them before they could be patched. The hack did not effect Coinbase users.  Mozilla  is asking users to update their browsers in order close these holes.

The announcement came during an interview on Radio One.  The prime minister said the reformed rental laws were approved by the cabinet after a long consultation period.  This initiative ensures security, prevents record tampering, and ensures only authorized persons can access the records, said Muscat. Additionally, the distributed ledger prevents the possibility of there being contracts in place for which there is no record.  “We will now be showing people the added value of this technology through applying it to something which they will use in their daily lives,” he said. “This shows how the digital transformation will affect their lives.”  Malta – also known as “blockchain island"" – first made moves into the world of cryptocurrencies in July 2018, when they released a relaxed regulatory framework favorable to distributed ledger technologies. Electronic money, financial instruments, virtual tokens, and virtual financial assets were granted a path to legitimacy. By March of that year, Malta’s lawyers were reportedly tokenizing themselves.  A tolerant regulatory environment, educated workforce, and E.U. membership all contribute to Malta becoming a burgeoning hub of blockchain experimentation.

According to a report from local news source Interfax.ru, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseyev told journalists on Friday that among the options currently being discussed is to allow the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies. Crypto payments are not on the table, however.  Worryingly for the country's crypto community, the bill could still see cryptocurrency use banned outright.  Moiseyev said that the finance ministry had met with the Russian central bank and the Federal Security Service, the nation's security agency, to discuss the bill.  ""There is a range [of possibilities] from prohibition to the possibility of purchase,"" he explained. ""Like with foreign currency, it would be possible to buy and sell [cryptocurrencies], but impossible to use them for payments. After a political decision is made on this issue, we will have the responsibility.”  Russia's bill on digital financial assets was expected to be considered at the plenary session of the State Duma on March 19, but was postponed.  According to the report, Anatoly Aksakov, head of the Duma Financial Market Committee, has said that Russia must adopt a bill on cryptocurrency before the end of this year in order to comply with recommendations from international watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  In related news, FATF announced new standards on Friday that include a controversial requirement that “virtual asset service providers,” including crypto exchanges, pass information about their customers to one another when transferring funds between firms.

In a report published late last week, SWIFT said that, following a successful proof-of-concept with R3's Corda platform, it would ""soon be enabling gpi payments on DLT [distributed ledger technology]-based trade platforms.""  Saying that GPI would resolve the ""payment challenges"" faced by DLT platforms, the firm explained that payments using the system would be initiated within trade workflows and be automatically sent on to the banking system.  Launched in early 2017, GPI was created as a set of business rules encoded on top of the firm's existing infrastructure as a means to increased speed, transparency and the traceability of transactions.  In the report, the firm said 55 percent of SWIFT cross-border payments are now being made over GPI, a payments flow worth over $40 trillion. ""Half of them are reaching end beneficiary customers within minutes, and practically all within 24 hours,"" the report stated, further predicting that all cross-border SWIFT payments will be made over GPI ""within two years.""      At the launch of the proof-of-concept back in January, SWIFT explained that the trial would connect the GPI Link gateway with R3’s Corda platform to monitor payment flows and support application programming interfaces (APIs), as well as SWIFT and ISO standards.    Commenting on the SWIFT news, Charley Cooper, managing director at R3, said:      “We’re proud to be pioneering this work with SWIFT on the GPI Link initiative and R3’s Corda Settler. SWIFT’s intention to expand blockchain access to its GPI Link is an important step towards enterprise blockchain adoption and Corda is already a leader in this space. The ability for firms utilising enterprise blockchain applications to settle off chain using existing, established and trusted payment networks, like SWIFT, allows firms to access the efficiency gains from blockchain while reducing the friction in crossing between on-chain and pre-existing payment systems.”            It's also notable that R3 began testing its Corda Settler payments engine with XRP, the native cryptocurrency of Ripple, prompting a frisson of excitement among Ripple supporters. In any case, R3 has made clear from the start that the technology was always designed to be interoperable with a variety of payments systems.  Edit (09:00 UTC, June 25, 2019): Added comment from R3.

42430657,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdVh,1561377638,TechCrunch Founder Sells $1.6 Million House on Crypto Real Estate Platform,"Propy  , a blockchain based real estate platform, announced the sale of a $1.6 million San Francisco property owned by the venture capital fund CrunchFund, co-founded by Michael Arrington.  The announcement follows news of Propy’s highest cost transaction to date, a $2.4 million duplex in San Francisco, completed entirely on the platform.  Propy is a real-estate transaction platform that empowers buyers, sellers, their agents, and escrow agents to close a traditional real estate deal entirely online. The purchase offer, payment and deeds are uploaded to an immutable blockchain.  “The traditional real estate sale process is arduous and broken. Buyers, sellers, and their professional support struggle with overly complex interactions – it’s an opaque, dated, and unnecessarily lengthy process, full of risks such as wire fraud,” said Arrington, founder of TechCrunch, whose most recent venture is into blockchain capital investments and management with his $100m firm, Arrington XRP Capital.  “When it comes to expensive property or other expensive goods, these normally already have digital presentation of ownership, that’s why blockchain is applicable to space,” said CEO Natalia Karayaneva. “Blockchain’s main implications, after [virtual] money, is as a technology that enables ownership transfers… it aligns the entire process of any value transfer including real estate.”  Propy completed its first deal in 2017, and its first US transaction in Vermont 12 months ago. Worldwide, they have assisted in some form in over 60 real estate transfers. This includes auctioning a 17th century Italian mansion and UNESCO site on its blockchain.  The median price of a house sold on its platform is around $1.5 million, said Karayaneva, though the value of the houses is steadily increasing. About 20 realtors have closed deals on the platform, though 3,000 have signed up.  Karayaneva believes in two or three years the majority of real estate transactions will be entirely digitized. The company is working with county governments to provide technology that automatically and immediately reports the transfer of title deeds.  “We don’t want to work against them. Either we help them or will eliminate them,” she said.  The venture capital arm of the U.S. National Association of Realtors (NAR) recently invested an undisclosed amount in Propy via its REACH accelerator program. The company also raised $15.5 million via an initial coin offering in 2017.  Arrington previously purchased a $60,000 apartment in Kiev through Propy, using ethereum and smart contracts to settle the deal.

In one job description posted Monday, Facebook indicated it's looking for a head of data science at Calibra wallet – an app that's being developed for the Libra project. The new role is focused on analyzing how customers are using Calibra and making decisions based on that data across Facebook's teams and products.  The data engineer will need to use ""quantitative analysis, data mining, and the presentation of data to see beyond the numbers and understand how our users interact with our core products,"" the ad says.

The engineer will also manage the proper service-level agreements – that is, the agreements between Facebook's services and its customers on what the company will do to provide the services and what the customers should expect.  Lending and wealth management  The job description also gives some specifics on Facebook's ambitions regarding the future developments of Calibra, including banking and financial services:  ""The wallet will be the delivery vehicle for many financial services starting with personal payments, but expanding to online and offline commerce and eventually lending and personal financial management. We are very focused on the mission of creating opportunities for the billions of people around the world that are excluded or are underserved by the incumbent financial players.""  This is the second job for Calibra posted by Facebook so far. On Friday, the company announced it was seeking a finance program manager to plan, lead and execute ""on global, cross-functional finance projects,"" CoinDesk reported. The job description didn't specify that the manager will be working for Calibra, but Facebook spokesperson Elka Looks later told CoinDesk in an email that the new position was meant for the wallet app.  In total, Facebook’s career website now has over two dozen blockchain-related jobs, as the company looks to grow the team working on Libra – an initiative that picked up pace with the hiring of former staffers at blockchain startup Chainspace earlier this year.  Data privacy concerns  Libra became the biggest blockchain-related news in recent months, reaching a peak with Facebook's publication of the project's white paper last week. The company announced partnerships with companies including Uber, Lyft, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard, who have all joined the Libra Association, a non-profit dedicated to the network's development. Crypto-oriented companies like Bison Trails, Coinbase and Xapo are also on board.  However, the way Facebook is handling users' data has been a point of concern for the blockchain and crypto community when talking about Libra. In particular, startups like Stellar, Tendermint and MobileCoin declined to work with Facebook, according to CoinDesk sources, because of the enormous control over users’ financial information that the Libra Association will have.  ConsenSys founder Joe Lubin warned about trusting Facebook with wallet data in an op-ed for Quartz on Friday, saying:  ""That our digital identity will never merge with Libra’s financial data is a hard perception to shake. It is almost a given, even if they have the best of intentions — 'accidents' and incursions happen when relying on centralized architectures.""  To address potential policy risks for the Libra project, Facebook is looking to fill another post for a public policy manager.  The role includes analyzing possible policy risks and ""responding strategically to related legislative and regulatory initiatives."" The candidate should have experience in ""emerging payments, commerce, blockchain, digital identity, cryptocurrency, and related policy issues, as well as experience working on technology policy issues generally,"" the ad says.  Members of the U.S. Congress also voiced some concerns over the greater power Facebook will acquire once it's in charge of a global financial network. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told Yahoo Finance: ""I’m concerned about their size, I’m concerned about their anti-competitive conduct, I’m concerned about their rampant violations of privacy.""  Congress has already spent quite some time trying to figure out how Facebook is handling its users' data after the scandal involving Cambridge Analytica – the private company that used large amounts of Facebook's users data to influence the voters' moods during the 2016 presidential election.  Now, the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs has scheduled a hearing on July 16 focused on Libra and named ""Examining Facebook’s Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations.""

42430676,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwe1h,1561374134,Bitcoin on Track for Best Second Quarter Price Gain on Record,"View  Bitcoin's 165 percent gain so far this quarter is the best second quarter performance on record and the highest quarterly percentage gain since the end of 2017. The stellar gains have bolstered the long-term bullish technical setup.  While the relative strength index is reporting overbought conditions, there are no signs of bullish exhaustion on the daily, 3-day or weekly charts. As a result, the outlook remains bullish with resistances lined up at $11,247 and $11,394, according to Bitstamp data.  A minor pullback to $10,000 could be seen if the price again fails to hold onto gains above $11,000, validating a more bearish setup on the 4-hour chart.  The bullish outlook would be invalidated if the price finds acceptance below $9,097 (May 30 high).      Bitcoin (BTC) appears to be powering to the best second quarter price gain on record and the best quarterly performance overall since late 2017.  At press time, the 165 percent gain on the April 1 opening price of $4,092 is the biggest percentage rise observed in May to June to date, going by Bitstamp data.  Further, bitcoin’s triple-digit gain so far for Q2 is the best quarterly rise overall since the fourth quarter of 2017. Over that period, the cryptocurrency rose 230 percent, propelling prices to a lifetime high of $20,000 in December.  Monthly chart  With the 165 percent price rise, BTC seems to have left the bear market far behind. In fact, the bearish-to-bullish trend change was confirmed on April 2, when prices rallied $1,000 to levels above $5,000.  The cryptocurrency then rose above $8,000 in the run-up to New York Blockchain Week held from May 10 to May 18 and remained bid after the event to hit highs near $9,100 on May 30.  The two-month double-digit winning streak has now extended into June, with prices briefly hitting 15-month highs above $11,000 over the weekend. The recent leg higher from $7,500 to $10,000 could be associated with Facebook’s foray into cryptocurrencies.  Observers  believe that Facebook’s Libra project will not only boost the adoption of cryptocurrencies, but will also strengthen bitcoin’s appeal as an anti-establishment asset.  Further, the leading cryptocurrency by market value is set to undergo a mining reward halving in May next year. Therefore, the long-term price prospects look bright.  In the short run, however, a repeated failure to hold onto gains above $11,000 could yield a correction. As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $10,880, representing 2.4 percent gains on the day.  Weekly, 3-day and daily charts  The RSIs on the weekly, 3-day and daily charts are reporting overbought conditions with above-70 readings.  So far, however, prices aren’t showing any signs of bullish exhaustion. The bullish structure of higher lows and higher highs is intact and the 5-and 10-candle moving averages (MA) on all three charts continue to trend north.  The overbought readings on the RSIs would gain credence only if signs of bull exhaustion emerge in the form of candlestick patterns such as doji, bearish engulfing, hanging man, etc.  The bullish outlook would be invalidated only if and when prices drop below $9,097 (May 30 high), invalidating the bullish higher lows and higher highs pattern.  On the higher side, resistance is seen at $11,247 (Sunday’s high) and $11,394 (50 percent Fibonacci retracement of the bear market drop).  4-hour chart  BTC has failed twice over the weekend to hold onto gains above $10,000 with the RSI charting lower highs (bearish divergence).  That RSI pattern would gain credence if the cryptocurrency again fades a break above $10,000, leading to a drop toward $10,000 – the support of the ascending trendline.  BTC was expected to put on a good show in the three months to June 30 this year, as a number of technical indicators had turned bullish in February and March.

42430656,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdZh,1561369232,BIS Wants 'Level Playing Field' for Banks Amid Threat from Facebook,"The Bank for International Settlements (BIS), often described as the bank for central banks, has issued its annual report for 2019, expressing concerns over the expected disruption as big tech firms like Facebook enter the financial space.  While titled ""Big tech in finance: opportunities and risks,"" the report looks at the risks and challenges posed by companies such as Alibaba, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Tencent, rather than paying lip service to the potential benefits of this building fintech revolution.  These firms have developed huge customer bases, says BIS, and have the benefit of a ""data-network-activities loop"" which gives them "" the potential to become dominant.""  While the encroach of such companies into payments, money management, insurance and lending has only just started, it brings the potential for major change in the finance industry.  On the benefits, BIS writes:  ""Big techs' low-cost structure business can easily be scaled up to provide basic financial services, especially in places where a large part of the population remains unbanked. Using big data and analysis of the network structure in their established platforms, big techs can assess the riskiness of borrowers, reducing the need for collateral to assure repayment. As such, big techs stand to enhance the efficiency of financial services provision, promote financial inclusion and allow associated gains in economic activity.""  However, such change brings new risks, according to the report. As well as the old issues of financial stability and consumer protection, ""big techs have the potential to loom large very quickly as systemically relevant financial institutions."" At this point, BIS specifically raises the recent reports of Facebook's new Libra project, which sees the social media giant ""considering offering payment services for their customers on a global basis.""  There are also ""important new and unfamiliar challenges"" that, BIS suggests, go beyond the remit of current regulations. The report says that ""Big techs have the potential to become dominant through the advantages afforded by the data-network-activities loop, raising competition and data privacy issues.""  As such, policies will be needed for a ""comprehensive approach"" on financial regulation, competition policy and data privacy regulation.  ""The aim should be to respond to big techs' entry into financial services so as to benefit from the gains while limiting the risks. As the operations of big techs straddle regulatory perimeters and geographical borders, coordination among authorities - national and international – is crucial,"" according to the report.  In a somewhat telling statement, BIS further reveals its fears that banks could lose ground to the new big tech disruptors saying:  ""Regulators need to ensure a level playing field between big techs and banks, taking into account big techs' wide customer base, access to information and broad-ranging business models.""  And with such major companies having the ability to work across borders, international coordination is needed on rules and standards to address the potential shift in the ""risk-benefit balance,"" says BIS.  As the report suggests, Facebook's crypto project may not have an easy time with the world's regulators as the firm seeks to launch financial services for its billions of users.  France has already moved to create a task force within the G7 nations to examine the issues raised by Libra, while U.S. lawmakers have also expressed concerns over the project.

42430661,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdbh,1561366823,This Ethereum Lottery Perfectly Explains How Facebook's Big Corporate Backers Will Profit From Crypto,"To understand how early investors in Facebook's new Libra blockchain will make money over time, it helps to dig into a new lottery going live on ethereum mainnet Monday.  It's a lossless lottery called PoolTogetherhttps://www.pooltogether.us/how-it-works and tickets are now on sale. Its similarity to Libra is not a completely one-to-one relationship, but the key insight of both is the same: Earning interest on your own money is good, but it's better to also earn interest on other people's money.  So first let's explain this new ethereum game before circling back to Libra.  On PoolTogether, each ticket sells for 20 DAI (the stablecoin generated by the MakerDAO protocol, which aims to keep a stable price at $1.00 each). Each pool sells as many tickets as it can, and all the DAI gets put into the ethereum-based money market protocol, Compound. There, all the ticket money collects interest over the life at the pool and at the end, one ticket earns all the interest off everyone's ticket price.  But everyone else gets the money they paid for their tickets back, too – ergo, no losers.  Gamified savings  ""What excites me is that I think it can actually move the needle on economic health for a lot of people,"" PoolTogether's creator, Leighton Cusack, told CoinDesk.  People get excited about lotteries. They don't excited about savings accounts. This is a way of nudging them in the right direction.  The idea of putting the concept on ethereum was first discussed in a popular post on the MakerDAO subreddit in late March, and the project has been made possible thanks in part to a $25,000 grant from MakerDAO, the company.  ""We think it's good for the ecosystem,"" MakerDAO's Richard Brown, who runs community development for the decentralized finance firm, said of the project. ""One of the things that interested me the most about this is it has the capacity to take a behavior that was essentially a tax on the poor and it allows it to become a tool for social good.""  In other words, lots of low-income people gamble despite dismal chances of ever benefiting. Personal finance site Bankrate has found that people are less likely to buy lottery tickets as household income increases. PoolTogether takes the attractiveness of gaming and combines it with the healthy behavior of delayed gratification.  The strategy isn't without precedent. Walmart has actually been running a gaming mechanic to encourage people to save money on their cash cards. People have locked up over $2 billion since 2017.  With no risk of losing money, people start saving money rather than spending everything they have. With the returns on a typical savings account currently at 0.9 percent, it's not even irrational for a new saver to participate in a program like this. The opportunity cost is quite low.  PoolTogether's approach  At first, there will only be one pool on the site. It will be open for tickets for three days and then the winner will be announced after earning 15 days worth of interest, on July 11. PoolTogether will shave off 10 percent of the interest earned for its business model and the rest goes to the winner. It's all defined in a smart contract recently audited by Quantstamp.  MakerDAO's Brown believes the model could become a frictionless way for large groups of people with disposable funds to support good causes.  For example, someone could create a decentralized autonomous organization where all the interest on a pool goes to a wallet controlled by a non-profit of the winner's choice (rather than into their personal account). He called it a new kind of ""primitive"" for decentralized finance, saying:  ""It's pretty low-friction. It's pretty low-risk. It's low-stress, because no one is coming out of this thing broke.""  PoolTogether's Cusack foresees the project starting off just big enough. He wants the first winner to basically double their money off the winning 20 DAI ticket. That's going to take getting a pool together of 100,000 DAI, Cusack said, which is a big goal but they already have several commitments to prime the pump with 1,000 DAI each.  So what about Libra?  Libra is also designed so that a select few capture the interest earned on money tucked away by the vast many.  As CoinDesk previously reported, there are two tokens that make Libra work. Most of the attention has been on the Libra coin, the stablecoin backed by some as-yet-unnamed basket of bonds and currencies. To get that basket started, though, Facebook came up with the idea for the ""Libra investment token"" (LIT).  Like PoolTogether, the whole point of LIT is to earn interest off other people's deposits.  To make sense of why this is so powerful, think of a very simple example. Imagine one LIT sold for $10 million. Invested in a basket of boring, safe investments, Canaccord Genuity has projected the reserve should earn about 0.25 percent. So $25,000 in a year on $10 million. That's not nothing, but it's a lousy return for a tech investor.  But imagine 100,000 people decided they wanted to use Libra coin, and all of them bought $100 worth each. Now that holder of the one LIT will earn $50,000 in a year, because the reserve was doubled with other people's money, but only the LIT earns the interest.  Now, this is a global project, so obviously Libra's backers want to get in a lot more than 100,000 people. Even if a billion dollars in LIT tokens are sold, with companies like Visa, Uber and PayPal involved, there's no way they aren't targeting many, many billions in the reserve. With each additional billion, the returns multiply to LIT holders.  Canaccord Genuity estimates that if Libra coin gets a market cap equal to bitcoin's, $162 billion, then $324 million could be paid back to all LIT holders each year, after subtracting operational expenses for the Libra Association.  Let's assume no organization holds more than one LIT and the Libra Association hits its 100 founding partners as planned: that's a $3.24 million annual return on each partner's $10 million investment. It's not a one-time return either. They keep getting it as long as the Libra coin keeps running.  So 10 years after it matches bitcoin's market cap, a LIT holder would have earned $32.4 million without losing any of their principal, a better than 300 percent gain. And that's assuming the reserve didn't grow at all as the decade passed.  On PoolTogether, everybody is betting that they can win the interest off of everyone else's tickets. A crypto newbie could buy one ticket for 20 DAI and get all the interest earned off a whale who bought 1,000 tickets.  On the Libra protocol, it works the same way, except the same whales always win.  It remains to be seen if Libra will get to that point or if it will even get off the ground, but PoolTogether is starting now for anyone who wants a shot at robbing a whale. The person who created the product that will host the first pools, Compound's Robert Leshner, told CoinDesk that he'll definitely be buying some tickets in the first round.  Said Leshner:  ""We love watching the world experiment with new products and new ideas built on top of Compound no matter what they do. I'm excited.""

42430671,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMwdth,1561348815,A Monumental Fight Over Facebook's Cryptocurrency Is Coming,"Michael J. Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative.  The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday exclusively to our subscribers.      Given how slowly Washington lawmakers have taken to devise a coherent, informed view of cryptocurrency, the Chair of the House Financial Services Committee’s rapid leap to action last week over Facebook’s ambitious Libra project was remarkably fast.  But let’s reflect not on the details of Rep. Maxine Waters’ (D-Calif.) urgent requests that Facebook to cease work on Libra until after hearings are held or on how European lawmakers made similar appeals. The important takeaway from these legislators’ actions is that they are able to make such demands at all. since this is not the case with truly decentralized projects.  Unlike with bitcoin, representatives in Congress can directly identify and talk to the people in charge of the Libra project. They can subpoena them and, thus, pressure them. They might start with David Marcus, head of Facebook subsidiary Calibra, but, ultimately, it’s Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who’ll give lawmakers the greatest leverage.  In this case, the buck stops with Zuck.  Now, imagine a Congressional leader calling for a halt in bitcoin development. Who exactly are they going to pressure to end an open-source project involving millions of globally spread mostly unidentifiable developers, miners and users?  This distinction – between one project with a single, identifiable authority figure and another whose governance is distributed and leaderless with a founder who has never revealed their identity – goes to the heart of a crypto community critique that the social media giant’s initiative is not censorship resistant.  When there’s someone in charge, an interested party – a policymaker, a banker, a regulator, a shareholder – can lean on them to make changes. And when the blockchain consensus model is based on a club-like permissioned membership, a coordinated effort to alter, or censor, the ledger is always possible. And if the ledger or its software can be altered by this pressure, the Libra platform can’t unconditionally promise to support open, unfettered access for users and a permissionless innovation environment for developers.  Let’s be clear: Libra’s designers have thought deeply about how to protect their project from Facebook itself, both in a real sense and that of public perception. In its commitment to decentralization, the team has put the code under an open-source license, handed the network’s governance authority to a separate Swiss-based foundation, brought in 27 external partners to work alongside Facebook as independent, permissioned nodes in the network, and verbally committed to transition to a permissionless model over time. There is a structure and roadmap in place for Libra to grow and survive regardless of its genesis as a Facebook project.  All that’s fine. But we’re still at the genesis phase, one that is and will for some time hinge on the centrality of a particularly powerful company.  The culture problem  At the risk of stating the obvious, Marcus and his team are paid by Facebook. Follow the money, as they say. But also, follow the code.  The Libra protocol’s all-important source code is now open-sourced, but it was conceived and gestated inside Facebook. So, whether the project managers and programmers resist or not, the culture of that organization will inherently feed into Libra’s design priorities.  The elephant in the room is that a drumbeat of recent news has revealed Facebook’s corporate culture to be profoundly toxic. The company’s model of surveillance capitalism has turned users into pawns in a global game of data manipulation, cultivated echo chambers of narrow-mindedness, done irreparable harm to the worthy cause of journalism, and deeply undermined our democracy.  This legacy is the unavoidable reason why people, including lawmakers, are alarmed that Facebook might be on the verge of creating a new international model for money and payments. Rightly or wrongly, there’s a fox-in-the-henhouse optic here that’s unhelpful.  Wharton Professor Kevin Werbach argued in the New York Times this week  that Facebook’s Libra is a bold effort to win back public trust by leveraging the accountability ingrained in blockchain technology. But at the project’s genesis phase, with no choice but to trust Facebook’s early input, that legacy of prior mistrust could easily become a huge barrier to its progress.  We should support Libra, not Facebook  Notwithstanding all the above, I actually want Libra to succeed. (Note: I also want Facebook to die. That’s not a contradiction; those two outcomes can and should be separate. In fact, it’s the nub of the issue.)  The Libra team has set its sights on achieving financial inclusion for the 2 billion adults worldwide who don’t have bank accounts. It’s a noble goal, and they are going about in an intelligent way – from a truly international, cross-border, cross-currency perspective. Bring all those people into the international economy and the payoffs could be huge, for them and for the rest of us.  And let’s face it, bitcoin has dismally failed to live up to its advocates’ promises of a financial inclusion solution. Bitcoin’s and other cryptocurrencies’ impact on the $800 billion global remittances market is puny.  Sure, uptake could rise if the off-chain Lightning Network lives up to its promise to enable larger-scale transaction-processing, if stablecoin projects resolve bitcoin’s volatility problem, and if new encryption solutions can improve both security and user experience with crypto wallets. But these solutions will take time. We need to act now.  In the end, it’s not at all clear that global person-to-person payments are a viable use case for bitcoin, perhaps because too many HODLing speculators crowd all the spenders out. And, of course, no other payments-focused cryptocurrency has put a big enough dent in the remittance market.  So, perhaps the recipe for a global broadening in payments lies with a cross-border, low-volatility international stablecoin backed by a basket of leading fiat currencies and developed with the formidable programming and marketing resources of 28 tech and financial giants. Also, when you combine Facebook’s, Instagram’s and WhatsApp’s user count, the number of potential wallets runs to 4 billion. Global network effects. Instantly.  All other things being equal – that is, if we ignore, for now, the genesis problem of Libra inheriting Facebook’s toxic roots – one could also argue that a permissioned, corporate network is the best approach for the Libra blockchain in place of a fully open, permissionless chain such as bitcoin’s or ethereum’s. The heavy lifting needed for early global traction – the software development, the marketing effort and the public policy outreach – requires that significant corporate resources be deployed in a targeted, coordinated manner that’s hard for open-source blockchain communities to achieve. There are efficiency advantages to be had from centralization.  Over time, as the project grows, Libra hopes to expand the consortium. That could undermine the coordination efficiency, but in a classic centralization-versus-decentralization tradeoff, the addition of new members – more NGOs, some banks, a workers union perhaps, and some public pension funds – will achieve greater diversity and lower collusion capacity. It’s far from perfect but the timed transition brings things closer to censorship resistance at a time in the future when it will matter -- if it they get there.  What this means for bitcoin and crypto  As an aside, I also believe Libra’s success would be a positive for bitcoin – and the past week’s price action suggests that the market sees the same.  Here’s why: Currently the one value proposition that holds well for bitcoin is that it will be a more liquid, digitally up-to-date risk-hedging vehicle than gold when people need to preserve value in something immune from political and institutional risk. That argument could be enhanced if Libra succeeds in converting billions of people to digital payment wallets, because it will more broadly establish the power of blockchain-based digital money as the way of the future. At the same time, because of its genesis as a Facebook-initiated, permissioned system, Libra will not shake the perception of being prone to political – i.e. censorship – risks. For many, then, Bitcoin, aka digital gold, will become the obvious alternative.  The currency-basket-backed Libra token is, however, a real competitor to other reserve-backed crypto-tokens, such as USDC, issued by the CENTER coalition initially formed by Circle and Coinbase, GUSD, Gemini’s stablecoin, and PAX, from Paxos.  But we can imagine events working in the latter’s favor. Developing countries like India, for example, may become hostile to a new currency entering circulation that sucks demand away from their local currencies, but they would be more accepting of a digital dollar, given that the greenback already circulates in their economies. Users, also, might be happier holding tokens pegged to single sovereign currencies rather than in a hard-to-measure basket. And if concerns about centralized control undermines trust in Libra or limits innovation, the fact that these tokens are built on truly permissionless blockchains may make them more appealing (even if you still have to trust the reserve-holder to guarantee to the price stability.)  Whatever happens, the world of money flows is mind-blowingly huge. There are $6 trillion a day in foreign exchange transactions alone. That allows plenty of room for different models, different tastes, and different trust systems for coordinating digital value exchange.  Getting our priorities straight  The bigger risk is not that Libra succeeds and enriches Mark Zuckerberg even more but that neither Libra nor one of its crypto competitors ever succeeds in breaking down the barriers to economic participation. Financial exclusion breeds poverty, which in turn breeds terrorism and war.  And if we assume that the technology, if it isn’t yet ready, will ultimately get there, then the biggest threat to that is from a policy mistake.  The subtext of both Waters’ statements and those of European lawmakers was that this private exchange system can’t be allowed to replace national currencies. Thats' not what Libra intends, but the perception that it is undermining nation states’ sovereignty over money could stoke fears and lead to a ban on Libra. And if that happens, it sets an ugly precedent for or all other competing ideas, whether it’s USDC, GUSD, PAX or DAI or something else.  The projects capacity to foster financial inclusion could also be hurt by the Financial Action Task Force's, or FATF, embrace of a new rule for exchanging cryptocurrency. If ratified by enough countries that could curtail the free flow of cryptocurrency among addresses that haven’t been through a bank-like “know your customer” process. In other words, it could pose a real barrier to Libra’s and everyone else’s dream of financial inclusion for the “unbanked.”  The bottom line: the Libra team has its work cut out, and we all have a lot riding on it. The project’s representatives must face the reality that, for now at least, the buck still stops with Zuck, and that regulators will use that against them.  We should all wish them success in trying to convince policymakers that an open-system to global financial transactions is important. (It’s encouraging that the Bank of England is taking an open-minded view, proposing that tech companies like Libra be allowed to access funds directly from central banks.)  But, by the same token, we must be vigilant against corporate power that could easily convert this important project into something more sinister. Facebook’s own history is a reminder of the risks we face.  I wish it were a different company running with this ball right now. But since it’s not, the need for all of us to take a direct interest in this project is even greater.  We must demand that our representatives provide clear-headed, informed oversight that holds corporations like this to account and curtails their monopolizing powers. But we should also expect smart, open-minded regulation that encourages companies to compete and innovate in an open system that creates opportunities for everyone on this planet.

At 21:00 UTC on June 23, the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization shot upwards on the daily chart, cementing a new high beyond June 22's peak of $11,215. The move to another 2019 high comes after bitcoin's price dropped to as low as $10,416 on June 23 before another surge of buying pressure pushed prices back above $10,750 within the same day.  From then BTC bolstered 6 percent, rising above $11,000 at around 19:00 UTC on Sunday evening and then reaching over $11,300 two hours later. It’s currently changing hands at $10,768 as per CoinDesk’s price data.  BTC's 2019 bull run has already started off with a bang in recent weeks, a likely a combination of traders buying into their own fear-of-missing-out (FOMO) as well as institutions chasing the tail end announcement of Facebook's project Libra.  However, large levels of volume failed to accompany the rally, beginning at 97.6 billion traded over a 24-hour period and continued to decrease to as low as 67.5 billion by days end, meaning that the move was unsupported and a small sell-off from that point out, was definite.
