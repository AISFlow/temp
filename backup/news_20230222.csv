Four Russian nationals – Vladimir Okhotnikov, Olena Oblamska, Mikhail Sergeev and Sergey Maslakov – promoted Forsage on social media as a legitimate system, when in fact it was fraudulent scheme, according to a U.S. Justice Department statement announcing their indictments Wednesday.  Forsage relied on smart contracts on Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain and Tron that were ""consistent with a Ponzi scheme,"" the statement said.

Proposal FIP-188, posted last week on Frax’s governance forum, suggested setting the target collateral ratio to 100% using protocol earnings to increase the stablecoin reserves.  The result represents a significant shift for FRX, the fifth-largest stablecoin with more than $1 billion in market capitalization, as it eliminates the algorithmic element of the stablecoin’s stabilizing mechanism.  Read more: Algorithmic Stablecoins: What They Are and How They Can Go Terribly Wrong  Frax uses a hybrid design to keep its price pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is 80% backed by crypto asset collateral and partially stabilized algorithmically, burning and minting the protocol’s governance token FXS. Its issuer, Frax Finance, is managed by a decentralized autonomous organization through community proposals and votings.  According to the proposal, the protocol will not create additional FXS to hike the collateral ratio, which would inflate the token’s supply. Instead, it proposes retaining protocol revenues and authorizing the purchase of up to $3 million of frxETH, the protocol’s liquid ether staking derivative, to prop up reserves.  Sam Kazemian, co-founder of Frax Finance, said in the project's Telegram group chat that he favored increasing the collateral for being the ""safest design, while also being the most capital efficient.""  Some 98% of the voters favored the proposal.  Frax’s decision comes after multiple algorithmic stablecoins lost their price peg and eventually collapsed last year, triggering a wider downfall in crypto markets. The highest-profile fall, terraUSD’s death spiral in May, wiped out several digital asset firms in the subsequent contagion.

42412807,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6LfA,1677103813,"Polygon Blockchain Nodes Briefly Went Out of Sync, Affecting Explorer, Sowing Confusion","CORRECTION (Feb. 23, 4:42 UTC): Corrects story to say that Polygon nodes briefly went out of sync on Wednesday. An earlier version of this story stated that speculation over a possible blockchain malfunction was unfounded.  The Polygon blockchain ran into trouble on Wednesday after some of its nodes fell out of sync, causing a cascade of problems that hamstrung performance and knocked popular blockchain explorer PolygonScan offline.  The interruption on PolygonScan created the appearance that no transactions were taking place, sowing confusion and ultimately prompting Polygon’s leader, Sandeep Nailwal, to tweet that there were “issues” with the blockchain explorer.  “About 8:26 UTC, a few nodes went out of sync. This caused a reaction where some nodes could not validate blocks for a very brief period of time,” a spokesperson said, referring to the process by which decentralized networks such as Polygon add information to their permanent record.  Dapp developers reliant on impacted nodes struggled to get services back online, according to the founder of one infrastructure company, Rivet.  “While I would hesitate to call it a catastrophe, it is likely more people were impacted than were talking about it,” Rivet’s Greg Lang said of the incident.  Degraded performance  “There could have been a degradation in network performance temporarily,"" the spokesperson said, explaining the ramifications of some nodes falling behind. All nodes have come back in sync, the spokesperson said, and Polygon is investigating what caused the issue.  Polygon’s troubles appear to stem from an “unusually large” block reorganization that occurred two minutes before Polygon said nodes went out of sync, according to Lang. Rivet is a node infrastructure provider on Polygon.  When operators of a network publish two blocks at once, it creates a “fork” in the chain in which there are dueling accounts of the chain’s permanent record. A block reorganization is how the network resolves the discrepancy: It excludes one of the records in favor of what the network deems the correct, “canonical” record.  Small block reorganizations are commonplace on Polygon and other networks based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Lang said, and they’re not necessarily cause for concern. What was different on Wednesday was the size of the reshuffle: 157 blocks.  “The reorg was definitely outside the norm in size” for Polygon reorganizations, Lang said. “From Rivet’s standpoint it overran our ‘no-touch’ reorg correction mechanisms by at least a couple dozen blocks.”  Infrastructure providers handle reorgs differently, Lang said, but Rivet can automatically handle shuffles of roughly 125 or less. Beyond that, Lang said Rivet has to manually restore the chain history from backups. He said that likely happened on Wednesday.  Generally speaking, Lang said node operators can get thrown off kilter by blockchain reorganizations and could even “serve stale data” (data from excluded blocks) if they don’t get back on track fast.  “We certainly were in ‘all hands on deck’ mode,” Lang said of Rivet’s efforts to fix the issue.  Perhaps the most notable public-facing outcome of the blockchain's period of instability was an outage of popular block explorer PolygonScan. The Polygon spokesperson said the network issues “caused Polygonscan to get stuck” because the block explorer utilizes nodes that had fallen out of sync.  Polygon's Nailwal tweeted that PolygonScan was experiencing problems, and that the OKLink explorer was available as an alternative.",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | MATIC,"Sam Kessler, Danny Nelson",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/620ef87a9eb1a774480fa497c21f1722255176c4-1250x931.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Net position metrics show that Investors are sending bitcoin to exchanges and removing ether from them. The moves imply bearish sentiment for BTC and bullishness for ETH, a departure from their more typical correlated paths.  Exchange balances tend to increase when investors are considering selling an asset, or at least placing themselves in positions to do so quickly. Investors removing assets from exchanges implies that investors are looking to hold the asset.  The current trends don't necessarily predict longer-term future investor action, but they are noteworthy. Bitcoin trending bearishly would run opposite its average performance following a ""golden cross,"" such as the one that the asset reached Feb. 18. Bitcoin’s price rose an average 8% following the seven golden crosses since 2015 that preceded the latest one.  A golden cross occurs when the price of an asset’s 50-day moving average surpasses its 200-day moving average.  Motivations?  What’s behind the latest movements?  BTC prices remain up 42% year to date, and investors may be unable to ignore the temptation of realizing profits. A key point to watch will be whether BTC movement onto exchanges rises. The current increase has been mild, which may reflect more that investors are looking to manage risk as the market seems to be emerging from a period of contraction than negativity.  ETH activity has been more pronounced because its exchange net position change has been negative in each of the last 13 days. ETH was removed from exchanges even as prices declined 10% between Feb. 7 and Feb. 13.

42421381,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuNZ,1677100853,An Overlooked Source of BTC Support: Its Price Floor,"As surely as the Earth spins on its axis, spring emerges after winter. This applies to markets as well, and few markets have suffered as brutal a winter as crypto assets. It’s not just the collapse of prices that hurt, it’s also the implosion of key components of market infrastructure, starting with the Terra ecosystem and ending with … well, that’s still to be determined.  The two threads of doom – a weakening macro environment and structural fragility – fed upon each other, with price drops unmasking faulty disclosures, risk practices and incentive constructs, which led to further price drops and further unmasking. Until they didn’t anymore. That’s the part I want to focus on here: Why prices stopped falling.  Noelle Acheson is the former head of research at CoinDesk and Genesis Trading. This article is excerpted from her Crypto Is Macro Now newsletter, which focuses on the overlap between the shifting crypto and macro landscapes. These opinions are hers, and nothing she writes should be taken as investment advice.  In early November, as the shock of the FTX revelations tore through the ecosystem, BTC suffered what would be its last leg down, dropping to around $16,000. The bad news did not stop coming: the bankruptcy, the magnitude of the fraud, the spread of the damage, the suspension of withdrawals and subsequent bankruptcy of the industry’s “blue-chip” lender, concerns about bitcoin’s largest fund … The hits kept coming. But BTC did not fall further, when – just going by the bleakness of the narrative – in theory it should have. What happened?  It has to do with bitcoin’s multiple use cases. Many insist that the asset is only about speculation: there’s no fundamental value, price is driven by narrative and nobody uses it. This blinkered assumption even tends to come from experienced market watchers, which is an encouraging lesson for the rest of us (as in, no one understands everything, no matter how much of a household name they may be).  Those of us who have been paying attention know they are wrong: Bitcoin is not just for speculation. It is a speculative asset, sure.

While we don’t know who is behind these trades, on-chain data tells us that the vast majority of BTC moved on any given day was last moved in the previous 24 hours (the light yellow-dark yellow area in the chart below). In other words, most on-chain activity is short-term churn. While some of this could be payments, we can probably assume that at least most of that is, for now, the result of speculative moves.  However, this accounts for less than half of the bitcoin in circulation. Most BTC held in addresses do not move much. Over 67% has not moved in over one year, almost 50% has not moved in over two years when so far this year most of that cohort could have sold at a profit. Even being conservative and removing all coins dormant for more than 10 years because they could be considered “lost,” over half of outstanding BTC has been stationary for over a year.  While any of these holdings could be sold at any time, and many probably will be should the BTC price continue to rise, these address owners are not pure speculators. For them, BTC is a long-term investment, a store of value, a hedge – whatever you want to call it, for them bitcoin does have utility beyond short-term speculation.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Security Tokens and Tokenized Securities Are Not the Same Thing  A caveat against using address-based analysis: With the recent mass exit from exchange custody given the concerns about market structure, reading address tea leaves is harder than ever. For instance, the number of non-zero addresses is shooting up – but this doesn’t necessarily mean an uptick in activity, it could just be people moving coins off-exchange. In other words, these are not necessarily new users, they are just moving coins around. Or, they could be new users. We just don’t know. However, when looking at bitcoin that hasn’t moved in a while, we can be relatively confident about what we are seeing – you can’t disguise a lack of movement. If anything, the HODLer positions are probably understated – many investors may have held their BTC on exchanges up until the market drama. They are long-term holders, but on-chain they appear short-term holders.  Back to the thread … Bitcoin is a speculative asset, and a long-term investment. For some it is a payment tool, judging from the growth on the Lightning Network. Bitcoin is all of those at once, and perhaps in the future it will also be a non-fungible token (NFT) platform. Who knows? This multifaceted use case lends support. Back when bitcoin's price was at the local floor, accumulation was scooping up the sell pressure from miners and exiting speculators. That provided some price support and goes a long way toward explaining why, even amid further terrible news, the price didn’t fall further.  The below chart from Glassnode color-codes accumulation according to address size. Purple represents large holders accumulating, yellow shows that smaller participants are becoming more active. Back in November, after BTC dropped to $16,000, large holders were buying the dip. Some of this could have been for speculation. But back then sentiment was as bleak as I’ve ever seen it. Volatility moves suggested that traders were stampeding for the exits, and speculators generally found more attractive risk profiles elsewhere.  This multi-use case not only provides a strong floor support, it also explains why even experienced traditional market watchers don’t “get it.” Can you think of any other asset that has multiple use cases? Gold and real estate come to mind – art, perhaps. But these have millennia of understanding behind them, and they are rarely confused with speculative assets because their prices are not volatile. Nor are these assets particularly liquid (with the exception of gold, although it could be argued that physical bars are only liquid at certain times of the day, and certain days of the week, if they are held at a centralized depository, which introduces new vulnerabilities). It is not easy to conceive of a liquid, always-on asset that represents different things to different people. This further underlines just how “unusual” bitcoin is – it’s speculative and volatile, it is also treated by many as a long-term investment, and history has shown that this lends the asset floor support while giving it ample upside.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - Bitcoin, Markets and the Symmetry of Information  Another reason why many seasoned investment veterans don’t “get it” is what they read in the media. Sharp price moves, uncovered fraud, exploits and examples of hype make for dramatic headlines, which get clicks and keep media business models afloat. It’s easy to see how those without the time or interest to dig deeper would take that as the whole story, especially when they are used to feeling “smart.”  But bitcoin’s theoretical and demonstrated price floor is a key feature of the asset’s asymmetrical risk – at these levels, the potential upside far surpasses the potential downside, especially now that we know the floor is not $0. Truly smart investors go beyond the headlines, even when it means going outside of comfortable frameworks.  What’s more, bitcoin’s use cases are still evolving – one example is the network’s possible use as a base for NFTs, another is the potential application of smart contracts. This will not only impact the debate around “intrinsic value,” it will also add more layers to the price floor. More traditional assets, even those also poised to benefit from the return of liquidity, don’t have this evolution embedded in the asset itself.  This implicit price floor goes a long way toward explaining why BTC has rallied so strongly this week. The price floor evolution also positions the asset as an intriguing longer-term bet.

42421375,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuHN,1677100773,AI Could Help Build More-Efficient Crypto Markets,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained tremendous traction over the last couple of months. Since the end of 2022, AI has become a household topic due to the mainstream adoption of OpenAI’s chatbot “ChatGPT” and its immediate, worldwide impact across industries and people's lives.  In 2022, consultants at McKinsey found that AI adoption had stagnated over the past few years. However, with the arrival of ChatGPT, adoption has increased significantly. According to OpenAI’s founder, Sam Altman, ChatGPT crossed over 100 million users in just two months, a milestone it took Facebook 4.5 years, Instagram 2.5 years and Twitter five years to achieve.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.” Marcello Mari is chief executive officer of SingularityDAO and Rafe Tariq is a senior quant researcher at SingularityDAO Labs.  As we start 2023, we see that Microsoft and Google are engaged in a fierce battle for AI dominance. They are competing with rival chatbots, search optimization and more – and it appears Microsoft is leading the way. The software giant gave OpenAI $1 billion in the initial stages of ChatGPT's development, taking a 46% stake in the company, and plans to integrate ChatGPT into its web browser Edge and search engine Bing, both of which are likely to revolutionise search and internet browsing.  When you think about it, AI may finally allow Microsoft to outcompete Google in a space the latter has dominated for years. OpenAI predicts that ChatGPT will generate revenue of $200 million by the end of 2023 and $1 billion by the end of 2024. It’s quite possible that by 2030 AI will become the number one industry in terms of revenue generation and market cap.  See also: Crypto AI Needs a Showcase to Know What's Real | Opinion  As we move towards a future where AI is everywhere, inevitably replacing many human jobs, it is interesting to consider how this powerful form of computing can be used to maximize opportunities in the crypto industry. AI can be applied to make crypto more efficient, and blockchain technologies can also be used to solve problems unique to machine learning.  Traditional AI methods applied to crypto  Sentiment analysis and cognitive distortion detection in social media  Sentiment Analysis is a technique in which natural language processing algorithms (NLP) are able to analyze text and attribute meaning to it, helping humans to understand whether there is a positive or a negative sentiment regarding a particular asset class.  In traditional finance, sentiment analysis was typically performed over news media. However, in the crypto market, by the time an update reaches the news, it's usually already too late to make money from trading. This may explain the adage ""buy the rumor, sell the news,"" meaning a new market trend must be spotted on social media as it happens or even before it happens.  As we know, crypto markets without volatility wouldn't be as attractive. The unpredictable movements in the crypto market play a crucial role in its dynamics. Therefore, there is a need for further development of AI and data frameworks to facilitate price prediction studies and applications.  These frameworks should be capable of collecting sentiment data from various channels, whether they are crypto-related or not, and should have an AI analytical framework that can integrate the latest developments in sentiment analysis research. It should also be able to distinguish a real person from a bot as well as real conversations from orchestrated ones.  These frameworks will be able to detect so-called cognitive distortions on social media, such as catastrophizing (exagerating the importance of a negative event: “because of this everything will dump”), fortune-telling (pretending to know about the future: “this will definitely happen”) and mind reading (pretending to know what other thinks: “everyone knows that.”)  Predicting market movements  AI has been used for decades in traditional finance to detect market dynamics before they occur. Traditionally, this has been achieved through sentiment analysis. However, in the field of cryptocurrency, we can rely on statistical correlation between major coins or categories of coins. For instance, in localized ecosystems like the decentralized exchange Curve or AI-focused SingularityNET, which have multiple tokens, we see lagging and correlative trading patterns emerge.  Due to rapid technological advancements in hardware used to secure and mine decentralized networks (i.e., the rise of GPU-based computation), the use of large-scale deep learning models has become increasingly valuable for understanding price fluctuations. Expanding machine learning and deep learning methods used in traditional finance to predict price fluctuation or identifying market regimes (i.e. whether we in a bear or bull market) is one of the key areas of exploration for AI use cases in crypto.  A further area of research regards the application of reinforcement learning, an AI technique that learns without supervision from humans (aka unsupervised learning) to better understand the impact of its actions. This has applications for predicting slippage and price impact when assets are traded.  Trading bots/AI-based market making  The AI team at SingularityDAO has conducted exploratory studies in the field of market simulation and backtesting to improve the state of the art in quantifying market dynamics. One promising technology we have explored is the ""adaptive multi-strategy agent"" (AMSA) for market making. This basically provides an environment where different AI algorithms can buy and sell assets and backtest those trades, while evaluating the performance and effect trading has on the market.  These self-reinforcing trading algorithms can be seen as the next step evolution of traditional trading bots already widely adopted by traders and market makers on centralized exchanges. In other words, AI is being developed to help create more sophisticated automated market maker systems. This contributes to the adoption of more robust decentralized trading systems, and can help traders to rebalance their multi-asset portfolios.  Crypto native AI problems  Effective monitoring of dynamic position and entity risk  Due to the increasing frequency in crypto markets of black swans (unpredictable events with potentially severe consequences), traditional methods to evaluate risk in trading positions have become outdated. In crypto, analysts need to evaluate risk associated with liquidity movements across protocols and this is virtually impossible to do manually given the large amount of data to be analyzed.  An AI approach, once again, can extend human decision making.AI algorithms can be used alongside other methods commonly used to monitor the health of on-chain positions across all protocols, like analysis of large wallet holders and liquidation risk. By gaining expertise and experience in both AI and decentalized finance (DeFi), it is possible to create new metrics that can provide easy-to-read signals about risk exposure taken across different protocols.  Further, AI offers a substantial amount of value and support to human analysts as the crypto industry become increasingly multiprotocol (with development across blockchains happening even in the bear market), leading to a significant increase in complexity. Predictive and correlational risk methodologies are essential to prevent future black swan events, such as those that occurred with crypto exchange FTX and lending platform Celsius Network.  An emphasis on flow analytics, correlation and predictive analysis  Following the fallout of Celsius and FTX, there was an increased need to develop methodologies for monitoring events and factors that could lead to similar cases. Crypto analysts and data scientists explored a range of approaches, from classical alerting signals based on wallets and entities to more advanced AI-based capital flow aggregations.  Twitter vigilantes are already using AI-based analytics platforms to uncover news stories before they break to mainstream crypto news. However, a lot can be done to simplify and expand these tools in order to be adopted by the wider market.  AI techniques for malicious entity labelling and detection on-chain  In the crypto market, there is a constant game of identifying malicious entities on-chain, which requires the use of extremely large datasets. AI plays a crucial role in this transparency effort, using state-of-the-art clustering, genetic programming and neural networks to pinpoint these malicious entities to their aliases on-chain.  See also: Why Crypto Trading is Essential for the Cryptocurrency Industry | Opinion  As malicious users become more sophisticated in hiding their obligation to an entity, we rely on advanced AI algorithms along with geographical and behavioral data to identify these wallets.  Far away and here today  Although AGI (artificial general intelligence) or an AI that is sentient is still far away, progress in the field in the last few years has been remarkable. I strongly believe that in the future, artificial intelligence will manage our crypto funds and ensure the safety and health of our wallets.  The integration with large language models like ChatGPT has significantly expedited this process and will make it easy and accessible to anyone. Crypto has the potential to create a new inclusive financial ecosystem, and we have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lead the way in this and compete with Big Tech companies.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | RESEARCH,"Marcello Mari, Rafe Tariq",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2023/02/22/ai-could-help-build-more-efficient-crypto-markets,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1792f79709c94a89b92bbb548d369f080ba7ac7c-2048x1205.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42412817,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Lme,1677100439,What Coinbase's Q4 Earnings Mean for Crypto Adoption,"Coinbase (COIN) reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations and margins that are compressed, but ""it's not necessarily anything that's unexpected"" considering the current economic environment, Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of decentralized layer 1 blockchain Pastel Network, said Wednesday.  Nonetheless, “digital assets are certainly here to stay,” he said on CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover.”  On Tuesday, San Francisco-based Coinbase, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, reported fourth-quarter net revenue of $605 million, ahead of analyst estimates of $588 million, and up 5% from $590 million in the third quarter. Adjusted loss of $2.46 per share for the quarter also beat estimates for a loss of $2.52 a share but transaction volume fell 12% quarter over quarter to $322 million on lower overall trading volume.  During its earnings call, CEO Brian Armstrong cautioned retail investors “not to extrapolate those results forward,” pointing out that last year revealed just how fast the crypto market can change.  Investors are right to be wary, said Georgiades. Retail adoption today is “certainly up in the air” because crypto markets aren’t immune to the broader macro environment.  Coinbase has, in part, been able to capitalize on the bankruptcy of other crypto exchanges, he said. Because it is a U.S. publicly traded company, consumer and retail investors trust it. However, being a public company may also be one of its “largest intrinsic barriers” as it relates to regulation.  In the past few weeks, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been cracking down on crypto companies. Earlier this month, the agency settled a $30 million fine with crypto exchange Kraken, ordering it to close its U.S. staking service. The agency separately said it plans to sue Paxos for allegedly selling an unregistered security token, Binance USD (BUSD).  Attempts to diversify Coinbase’s revenue may face headwinds. Georgiades said investors should be mindful of the three hyper-growth areas Coinbase provides – coin custody, stablecoins and staking products. Those areas “are all coming under significant regulatory scrutiny.”  Depending on what the regulators do and whether “Coinbase is looking to continue to drive hyper-growth across those new product lines,” the company may “need to reevaluate where it's domiciled as well,” he said.

Even more humbling was the fact that nonprofits like AFDA and Red Crescent, which usually accept fiat donations, turned to crypto for its efficiency.  The use of technology is not an end in itself but a means to an end, which is to help people in times of crisis. We must never forget that it is people who need our help the most. The crypto industry's response to natural disasters highlights the need to improve the compatibility between a crypto infrastructure and traditional financial processes.  The article is part of CoinDesk's ""BUIDL Week."" Johnny Lyu is the CEO of KuCoin, the fifth-largest cryptocurrency exchange launched in 2017.  When a natural disaster strikes, it can leave entire communities devastated and in dire need of support and aid. While people all over the world want to help, the process of traditional donation methods can often be frustratingly opaque, leaving questions about where the resources are going and whether they're actually getting to the people who need them the most.  Immutable ledgers provide an unparalleled level of transparency that traditional donation methods simply cannot match. With trust in institutions at an all-time low, according to the 2023 Edelman Trust Barometer, this level of transparency is desperately needed. In our complex society, trust is being buried deeper under mountains of obscurity. This apparently vague sentiment can be quantified; the report says that only 44% of people surveyed have trust in institutions, down from 53% in 2019.  But it's not just transparency that makes crypto donations so impactful. With the ability to provide traceability and efficiency, blockchain technology offers a unique solution to the issues that plague traditional donation methods. With the use of smart contracts, which ensure that funds are only released once predetermined conditions specified in the contract are met, crypto donations provide an unprecedented level of accountability.

42412797,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6LUs,1677097158,Bitcoin Price Remains Lower After Release of FOMC Minutes,"The minutes from the Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting of the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) suggested both hawkish and dovish sentiments among the participants, but notably missing was any discussion of a pause in the U.S. central bank's rate hike cycle.  ""Almost all participants observed that slowing the pace of rate increases at the current juncture would allow for appropriate risk management,"" according to the minutes of the meeting, at which the Fed hiked the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, a slowdown from the 50- and 75-basis points hikes that became the norm through much of 2022.  For the doves, some participants noted a softening in the growth in consumer demand. On the hawkish side, though, some at the meeting said some measures of financial conditions had eased over the past few months – perhaps inconsistent with the degree of policy restraint necessary to bring inflation back to its 2% target.  Bitcoin (BTC) was down more than 3% for the day at around $23,800 prior to the news release, and currently remains around that level.  Bloomberg's David Wilcox found only one mention of the word ""pause"" in the minutes and that was in reference to other central banks. This is somewhat notable as markets as recently as three weeks ago had priced in a pause in the Fed's rate hikes in May (after one more 25 basis point rate hike in March). After a raft of strong economic data and a number of hawkish Fed speakers, markets now anticipate not just another 25 basis point hike in May, but the chance of the central bank hiking by 50 basis points in March.  That change in sentiment has helped push U.S. Treasury yields sharply higher, with the 10-year Treasury yield at more than a three-month high of 3.92% and the two-year yield to more than a 15-year high of 4.70%.

""The goal of the regulation is to allow activity in stablecoins while managing the risk inherent in using them, and adjusting the consumer protections and prudential requirements to this unique activity,"" the central bank said. As such, the BoI recommended requiring stablecoin issuers to keep reserves fully in-line with the amount of tokens outstanding. It also proposed that stablecoin issuers should be required to get licenses for operations. For coins that don't have ""systemic importance,"" issuers should be licensed by the Capital Market Authority, while those that do have systemic importance should be licensed by the Banking Supervision Department. In addition, ""a stablecoin that is declared to be a controlled payment system shall be overseen by the payment systems oversight function at the"" BoI, the document said. The proposed rules mapped out by the BoI are open to the public for comments and feedback until March 15.

42412798,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6LVo,1677096275,BlackRock Starts Metaverse-Themed ETF Despite Waning Investor Interest,"Investment giant BlackRock (BLK) is offering an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will focus primarily on tech companies that are exposed to the metaverse, even as some institutional investors appear to have lost interest in the concept after its immense popularity during the recent bull run.  The fund, iShares Future Metaverse Tech and Communications ETF (IVRS), will invest in companies that are expected to contribute to the metaverse in areas including virtual platforms, social media, gaming, 3D software, digital assets, and virtual and augmented reality, according to its website. The top five companies that are included in the holdings are Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDIA), Netease (NTES) and Roblox (RBLX).  Interest in building the metaverse, a concept first coined in Neal Stephenson’s 1992 science fiction novel “Snow Crash,"" has expanded in recent years, with independent platforms like Decentraland and The Sandbox gaining considerable market share.  However, general attitudes toward building the metaverse remain mixed, according to a recent survey from consulting firm KPMG. While over 90% of investors still believe the metaverse is the next phase of the internet, a large portion of investors remain cautious due to regulatory, privacy and adoption concerns.  Read more: A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse - CoinDesk  While major companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta demonstrated enthusiasm for the metaverse during the bull run, their funding of virtual social spaces has slowed amid an ongoing crypto winter. Microsoft was reported to have recently ended a project intended to encourage the use of the metaverse in industrial environments just four months after it was formed. Meanwhile, in 2022, Meta lost about $14 billion in its fledgling Facebook Reality Labs (FRL) division, which comprises its augmented and virtual reality operations.  Still, the new ETF is likely positioning itself for the longer-term potential of the technology, given the timing of the launch. ""[The metaverse] at this juncture, it is much like the internet of the early 1990s or the smartphone of the early 2000s. We expect it is going to be big, and very likely change people's daily lives,"" said Reid Menge, co-portfolio manager of the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund, in a blog post dated Feb. 8.  The ETF has a net asset value of about $5 million and trades on the New York Stock Exchange. It will primarily focus on equities and won't invest in cryptocurrencies directly. However, the fund will invest in companies that facilitate the use of payment systems or digital assets in the metaverse, according to its prospectus.

The crypto exchange acknowledged the problems last month with the tokens, also known as B-tokens, and said they had been fixed.  ""Per recent media reports, historically, the assets we used to collateralize B-token weren’t always kept in dedicated wallets,"" a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk. The spokesperson said that Binance has now established 35 dedicated wallets to hold collateral for B-tokens, and its new process ensures that minting only takes place after collateral is added to the appropriate, dedicated wallet.  ""Over the last few weeks, we have been moving the collateralized assets to dedicated wallets, one for each network, to make the 1:1 backing clearly visible,"" the spokesperson said. “This collateral has always been backing our users’ B-token assets and has always been available for withdrawal at any time. We are now simply showing it on-chain in dedicated wallets where it will remain until it may be required.”  Binance said it had decided to make its new process partially, rather than fully, automated, in order to limit security risks.

42412811,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Liu,1677093808,LinksDAO to Bid on Scottish Golf Course Following Vote,"LinksDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), is moving forward with plans to buy a golf course in Scotland following a landslide community vote in favor of the purchase that closed early Wednesday.  Nearly 90% of the 953 respondents voted in favor of submitting an offer to purchase Spey Bay Golf Club in Forchabers, Scotland, while roughly 8% voted against it and 3% abstained. The 18-hole property, located about a three-and-a-half hour drive outside of Scotland's capital of Edinburgh, has an estimated market value of £750,000, or about $900,000, according to Golf Business News.  Funds for the purchase will come from the $10.5 million in revenue the DAO collected from its non-fungible token (NFT) project that sold out early last year. LinksDAO members in charge of the initiative expect the golf course purchase and due diligence process to take roughly a month and a half.  “A primary goal of LinksDAO from the outset has been to purchase an extremely high-quality golf course for our members to call their own – shaping the course and club culture with the direction of the DAO, and creating the future of a golf and leisure club in the process,” the proposal’s authors wrote.  LinksDAO NFT holders have access to several golf courses in the U.S. as part of their membership, but Spey Bay Golf Club could be the first property the organization has purchased through its governance voting process. The proposal's authors say the organization is reviewing more than 30 properties for purchase, with five prospective purchases in the later stage of the due diligence process.  “A cash outlay of this size would not significantly affect our remaining course purchase budget, and in fact would not change our ability to purchase any of the four U.S. course options that we are deepest in diligence on,” the authors added.  LinksDAO has 5,305 unique holders of its membership passes, which were issued on the Ethereum network in December 2021. At the time of writing, the floor price for the project on OpenSea was 0.31 ETH, or about $500. According to OpenSea, the project has done about 6,145 ETH in total sales volume, or about $9.9 million.  LinksDAO's treasury balance is unknown, but the organization has a market cap of $4.34 million, according to CoinGecko data.

Last week, stablecoin issuer Paxos Trust was ordered by the New York Department of Financial Services to stop minting BUSD ( BUSD-USD ). Also, the SEC is looking to sue Paxos over breaching investor protection laws. The regulator is yet to take a final call on the charges, but an SEC lawsuit over BUSD will be a significant hit to the crypto industry. However, securities lawyers told The Wall Street Journal that the SEC may find it difficult to win a lawsuit over stablecoins as users of such tokens don't expect profits from their holdings. ""In your classic stablecoin… the profit is kept by the house,"" Timothy Spangler, partner at Dechert LLP, told WSJ . However, ""regulators are well within their jurisdiction to look under the hood,"" he added. Another potential roadblock for any SEC case is the fact that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the NYDFS labeled tether ( USDT-USD ) and BUSD ( BUSD-USD ) as ""virtual currencies"". According to lawyers, this could result in confusion when deciding which laws are applicable. Regulators have two Supreme Court tests by which they can classify cryptos as securities - Howey and Reves.

Hurt by a lingering market downturn, Coinbase's ( COIN ) transaction revenues plunged 86% to $322M Y/Y in Q4, and total average daily volume dropped 73% to $1.6B from a year ago. There were, however, some bright spots. For example, subscription and services sales drove higher by 33% Y/Y to $282.8M thanks to higher interest income. That, in addition to its cost-cutting efforts, helped the company's profit and sales come in slightly above Wall Street expectations.

42412805,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6LdI,1677087764,"NBA-Branded 'Top Shot Moments' NFTs May Be Securities, Judge Rules in Dapper Labs Case","The offering of Dapper Labs’ NBA-branded “Top Shot” non-fungible tokens might be securities, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.  The ruling on a motion to dismiss comes a year and a half after a class-action lawsuit was filed against Dapper Labs and its CEO, Roham Gharegozlu, in New York. The lawsuit alleges Gharegozlu and Dapper Labs violated federal securities laws by offering a non-fungible token (NFT) collection – the NBA Top Shot Moments – without first registering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  “The Court finds that Plaintiffs’ allegations render each consideration under Howey facially plausible and survive Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the alleged violation of Sections 5 and 12 of the Securities Act,” ruled District Judge Victor Marrero, of the Southern District of New York. The Howey Test mentioned by the judge was created by the U.S. Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as ""investment contracts.""  According to the ruling, Dapper Labs’ FLOW tokens – while not necessarily securities themselves – are “necessary to the totality of the scheme at issue.”  “Plaintiffs have alleged that, without FLOW tokens, no transactions on the Flow Blockchain can be validated. Indeed, the ‘Proof-of-Stake’ mechanism employed by the Flow Blockchain requires FLOW to power it and incentivize miners to validate transactions. In that respect, FLOW’s utility creates value for Moments through the network’s consensus as to ownership and the price of each transaction,” the judge said.  Dapper Labs filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit in September, arguing its collection of digital basketball cards are not securities.  “Basketball cards are not securities. Pokemon cards are not securities. Baseball cards are not securities. Common sense says so. The law says so. And courts say so,” lawyers for Dapper Labs argued.  However, Judge Marrero disagreed in his Wednesday ruling, which denied Dapper Labs’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit.  In the ruling, the judge went through the prongs of the Howey Test.  The judge said he found that the first prong, an investment of money, was “adequately pled,” noting neither party had an objection to that prong.  With regard to the second prong, whether there is a common enterprise, the judge looked at the definition of “pooling” of investors’ funds, pointing to precedents such as the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuits against Kik Interactive and Telegram, and the U.S. Department of Justice’s case against Maksim Zaslavskiy.  “The Court is persuaded that the [plaintiff's complaint] adequately alleges pooling to survive the Motion to Dismiss,” the judge wrote.  Marrero added that the “purchasers’ fortunes were tied to the overall success of Dapper Labs,” because Dapper Labs controlled the Flow Blockchain as well as the online marketplace where the Moments were sold and traded.  The judge also pointed to claims from the plaintiffs that Dapper Labs held funds from the sale of Moments for the purposes of fundraising and maintaining FLOW tokens’ value.  “The reasonable inference to draw from these allegations is that the capital Dapper Labs raises through the offer of Moments is used to develop and maintain the Flow Blockchain,” said the judge.  Other considerations further reinforce the judge’s conclusion, he wrote.  On the third prong, whether there is an expectation of profits, the judge said Dapper Labs “misstated” the law in saying there needed to be a “‘persistent’ promise of profit,” which appeals courts have said is not the case.  “As to the allegations here, the Court finds that Defendants’ public statements and marketing materials objectively led purchasers to expect profits,” the judge wrote, using screenshots of Top Shot tweets as examples.  He added, “Plaintiffs’ allegations, including those detailed above, are adequate to support a finding that Moments were primarily purchased for an investment purpose.”  The final prong of the test, the efforts of others, also appears to be met, the judge said.  “As detailed above, it is plausible that Moments’ value is derived almost entirely from the continued operation by Dapper Labs of the Flow Blockchain, which enables price transparency (and thus influences value) but, perhaps more critically, appears to provide purchasers with the ability to trade at all. Defendants’ failure to acknowledge the blockchain technology that underlies Moments is fatal to their Motion in this respect,” he wrote.  The judge also said the existence of a secondary marketplace controlled by Dapper Labs supports his conclusion.  “The allegations that Dapper Labs created and maintains a private blockchain is fundamental to the Court’s conclusion. By privatizing the blockchain on which Moments’ value depends and restricting the trade of Moments to only the Flow Blockchain, purchasers must rely on Dapper Labs’s expertise and managerial efforts, as well as its continued success and existence,” the judge wrote.  The judge said his conclusion “that what Dapper Labs offered was an investment contract under Howey is narrow,” and other NFTs may not be securities.  “Rather, it is the particular scheme by which Dapper Labs offers Moments that creates the sufficient legal relationship between investor and promoter to establish an investment contract, and thus a security, under Howey,” he wrote. ""... In sum, Plaintiffs adequately allege that Dapper Labs’s offer of the NFT, Moments, was an offer of an 'investment contract' and therefore a 'security,' required to be registered with the SEC.""

42421368,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuBB,1677086074,Was OneCoin’s Missing Cryptoqueen Murdered by Mobsters?,"New documents suggest that infamous crypto scammer Ruja Ignatova, co-founder of the OneCoin fraud and one of the FBI’s 10 Most Wanted, was murdered by a notorious drug lord as long ago as 2018. OneCoin, a Ponzi scheme that never launched a blockchain, ran from 2014 to roughly 2017, and allegedly fleeced victims of around $4 billion.  Though inconclusive, the new evidence would be consistent with prior hints that Ignatova and her fake crypto were entangled with organized crime. The story could also be a dire premonition of the danger facing other crypto scammers who may have dallied with high-level thugs – a group possibly including some of the most recognizable crypto-fraudsters of 2022.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  The evidence of Ignatova’s murder came in documents acquired by the Bureau for Investigative Reporting and Data, or BIRD. BIRD has shared documents seized after the shooting of Lyubomir Ivanonov, a former Bulgarian police commander. According to BIRD, the documents suggest that Ignatova was murdered in 2018 on orders from Christophoros Amanatidis-Taki, a notorious Bulgarian drug lord usually referred to simply as “Taki.” BIRD also claims the documents implicate the head of Bulgaria’s national homicide investigators, one Mikhail Naumov.  The documents also contain details about drunken statements made by a Taki affiliate. According to those statements, Taki ordered Ignatova’s murder, which allegedly occurred in November 2018 on a yacht in the Ionian Sea. According to the statements, Ignatova’s body was dismembered and thrown into the ocean. Finance Magnates has a good summary of the BIRD report here.  Ignatova has not been seen in public for more than five years, and intense speculation has swirled around her disappearance, including the possibility that she may have changed her appearance. Speculation flared again recently when a London apartment owned by Ignatova went on sale, but the BBC reports that sale was conducted by German prosecutors who had apparently seized the property, not by Ignatova.  The new evidence is tentative and partial, but BIRD is a seemingly reputable investigative organization focused on corruption in Eastern Europe, Russia and the Balkans. It is an affiliate of the respected International Consortium for Investigative Journalism.  The crypto-mafia connection  Prior to BIRD’s findings, the BBC’s Jamie Bartlett had assembled a variety of hints that Ignatova and OneCoin were either a front for organized crime or had become entangled with mobsters. Such a relationship could have seemed mutually beneficial for a time.  Taki’s apparent influence over high-level police officials in Ignatova’s native Bulgaria could have sounded like a path to safety for the so-called Cryptoqueen. And a cryptocurrency pyramid scheme, which included vast, opaque and entirely off-chain accounting, would have been an incredibly useful channel for both laundering illicit funds and generating its own profits.  This would not be the first time a high-profile scam (crypto-inspired or otherwise) was linked to organized crime and official corruption. As we explore in the first season of CoinDesk’s new “Crypto Crooks” podcast, for instance, there is significant evidence that the infamous BitConnect scheme was linked to corrupt officials in India.  But the main nexus of crypto and organized crime has long appeared to be in Eastern Europe, Russia and the Balkans (these are also hotbeds of traditional banking fraud). Meanwhile, there have been rumors of dark connections to more recent high-profile frauds – particularly those whose founders have fled to far-flung, non-extradition countries to evade prosecution in jurisdictions with strong rule of law. Speculation has swirled that investment funds or projects may have taken emergency loans from gangsters as the crypto market declined, for instance.  Read more: The Missing CryptoQueen Has Friends in (Very) High Places | Opinion  It is particularly suggestive that Terra founder Do Kwon, a South Korean national, has allegedly made the unlikely flight to Serbia, which shares a long border with Bulgaria. Recent U.S. Security and Exchange Commission charges have clearly established the fraudulent intent of the Terra project, and claim that Kwon has cashed out huge amounts of bitcoin after the scheme’s collapse.  We already know that many of the con men and hucksters who stole vast sums in 2022 were fundamentally very dumb people with little concept of risk management. That certainly could have led to entanglements with the kind of people who are willing to dismember your dead body and literally throw you to the sharks.

42421382,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcXnuOb,1677083400,Washington Plays Tennis With Crypto,"This week, Glenn Williams Jr. examines what politicians are saying about crypto regulation in Washington, D.C.  Then, Jodie Gunzberg, managing director of CoinDesk Indices, talks about the crypto sectors that continue to thrive despite the regulatory crackdown.  – Nick Baker  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  A Descent Into Partisanship for Digital Assets Won’t Benefit Anyone  I took the time last week to tune into the Senate hearing on cryptocurrencies titled “Crypto Crash: Why Financial System Safeguards are Needed for Digital Assets.” Quarterbacked by Democrat Sherrod Brown and Republican Tim Scott, it focused on the need for increased regulation within the digital asset space, punctuated by recent industry collapses.  At times I question the importance of even monitoring these events. It’s getting to the point where if you’ve heard one, you’ve heard them all. One concern, however, is whether the regulation of digital assets is drifting more and more into partisan waters, which I think is negative for all involved.  If the discussion around cryptocurrencies devolves into a scenario where one’s stance can be accurately predicted by which side of the aisle they sit on, it will have sunk to a level of simplistic discourse; a new technology like crypto deserves better than that. For that reason I often find political discussions around crypto as more akin to political theater.  But if you’re going to operate within a sector, it makes sense to have an idea of which way the regulatory winds are blowing. It certainly makes sense to challenge your own ideas with ones that may be counter to your own. I would encourage all to watch it, even at 1.25x speed – which I may or may not have done.  Chairman Brown’s testimony appeared to target cryptocurrencies in general. The overarching theme from my perspective is that the sector itself is not just vulnerable to fraud, but intrinsically emblematic of it. My guess is that if I sat down with him and discussed cryptocurrencies, it would largely revolve around its usage in criminal activity and the “greater fool theory” – the idea that the only value crypto has to the owner is being able to sell it to a bigger fool in the future at a higher price. It’s worth noting, however, that his testimony concluded with a list of pre-existing financial regulatory methods. Examining where crypto fits within an already existing framework at least implies that a place is seen for it.  Ranking member Scott’s testimony seemed to center around the failure of current regulators, with Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler singled out specifically. An acknowledgement that financial innovation is an engine for growth was stated, along with an emphasis on the need for existing regulation to be conducted in a timely and appropriate manner. My guess is that if I sat down with him and discussed cryptocurrencies, he’d ask me if I knew where Gary Gensler was.  From there, testimony was provided by Lee Reiners of the Duke Financial Economics Center, Professor Linda Jeng of the Georgetown Institute of International Economic Law and Professor Yesha Yadav of the Vanderbilt University Law School. Each provided their views on cryptocurrencies, discussing the harnessing of innovation, development of a self-regulatory organization (SRO) and the banning of cryptocurrencies outright. I think some of their suggestions warrant consideration, while other suggestions seem openly hostile to the asset class itself.  For example, a focus on clear disclosures by crypto exchanges makes perfect sense to me. A well-informed investor is prone to making decisions based on an underlying idea they believe to be true. It doesn’t guarantee that the idea is right, but at least it’s rooted in something.  The prohibition of the commingling of funds is also something that makes sense. I can’t think of a good reason why customer funds and firm funds shouldn’t be separated. It’s been the case for years within traditional finance, and for good reason.  The creation of self-regulatory organizations (SRO) within crypto rang as a viable option to explore as well. What also stood out is that it was presented as a practical (though not perfect) way to improve the current regulatory framework in short order. SROs exist within traditional finance, so a blueprint for implementing them already exists.  I take issue with the notion that bitcoin being 14 years old means it’s not a “new” asset class. While bitcoin’s genesis block was mined in 2009, a significant amount of trading activity has occurred within the last three to four years.  Moreover, it strikes me as incongruent to state bitcoin’s existence since 2009, but only noting its performance as an asset since 2021. The fall from $69,000 to $21,000 should absolutely be stated. But its rise in price from less than 10 cents to $21,000 since 2009 should be mentioned as well if the objective is to be balanced.  Still, what was most encouraging about the witness testimony is that, agree or disagree, I’m not able to automatically determine their political affiliation based on their recommendations. I don’t know if I can say the same for the people asking the questions, however.  There’s a cadence that is beginning to present itself in these hearings that mirrors that of a tennis match – one where politicians alternate back and forth between pro-crypto and anti-crypto statements, directing the bulk of their questions to whichever witness aligns most with their political party’s’ decided stance.  I sincerely hope that this does not become the norm. Extreme partisanship would be detrimental to all parties involved, because it will likely remove the nuance necessary to allow for technical innovation, while protecting individual investors from bad actors.  Ultimately, investor protection, financial inclusion and innovation are all necessary elements for healthy growth within the digital asset space. As members of the U.S. Congress work to achieve these goals, I hope that they view them more from the lens of individuals than as members of a political party.  – Glenn C. Williams Jr., CMT  Bitcoin, DeFi and Computing Thrive Amid Crypto Crackdown  After bitcoin’s (BTC) best January since 2015, it has retreated because the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is cracking down on crypto, and inflation was slightly hotter than expected. Despite these challenges, crypto continues to dramatically outperform traditional asset classes.  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), the broad measure of crypto returns, surged 6.5% in February through Feb. 16. Stocks haven’t done nearly as well, with the S&P 500 up only 0.5%. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index fell 2.2%, while the Bloomberg Commodity Index lost 3.9%.  A key reason why crypto is doing so well: Bitcoin is on a tear because the Ordinals Protocol essentially brings non-fungible tokens (NFT) to that blockchain. “This has demonstrated a new, high-value use case for the longest-running cryptocurrency chain,” CoinDesk Chief Content Officer Michael J. Casey recently wrote.  The big gain in the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (XBX) shows the enthusiasm. But many other digital assets performed even better. There are 158 total digital assets in the CMI, and 109 of them did better than bitcoin. These outperforming assets were concentrated in the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard’s (DACS) DeFi and Computing sectors.  Although they make up only 2% and 1.4%, respectively, of the CMI’s weight, their gains stand out. Month to date, Computing is up 23.5%, giving it a gain of 91.5% so far this year. DeFi is up 12.4% in February and nearly 66% in 2023. Computing has been driven by excitement over artificial intelligence (AI), with ChatGPT and Bing dominating the conversation. DeFi is the sector many are looking to for greater security and infrastructure.  Although Computing and DeFi are relatively small by market cap, there are many constituents in each sector: Computing has 23 assets and DeFi has 39. So opportunities for big gains (alpha, for you pros) are plentiful.  However, bitcoin is still in high demand as the most established, largest, most-liquid asset with the longest track record and deepest derivatives market. So, in order to mix bitcoin with some of these potentially high performers, some market participants prefer the CoinDesk Large Cap Select Index (DLCS), which is similar in concept to other market-cap-weighted flagship indexes to measure various asset classes.  Still, the digital asset market is in its early days, so the concentration is high currently with five assets (which are in two sectors) accounting for 70% of the index’s market capitalization. Therefore, some prefer a broader sector exposure through the CoinDesk Market Select Index (CMIS) that spans five sectors with at least five market-cap-weighted assets from each sector.  – Jodie Gunzberg, CFA, managing director of CoinDesk Indices  Takeaways  From CoinDesk’s Nick Baker, here’s some recent news worth reading:  MT. GOX: Once upon a time, in the early days of crypto, there was an exchange called Mt. Gox (which stood for Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange, just to clue you into the vibe). The business collapsed spectacularly because of a 2014 hack. The ensuing bankruptcy process has dragged on and on, but there was important news last week that may signal the end is in sight: The two largest creditors picked the repayment option that could allay fears the restructuring will tank the price of bitcoin (BTC).  CANADIAN CRACKDOWN: Canada is close to boosting requirements on crypto exchanges, putting it toward the front of the pack in terms of tangible action in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse. Surely, it will not be the last to do something, though.  SHANGHAI VOLATILITY: The Ethereum Merge didn’t stir up ETH prices much back in September. But there’s reason to believe that Shanghai, the Ethereum upgrade that will allow staked ETH to be unstaked, could generate volatility.  JUMP CRYPTO: Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission didn’t identify the company that made more than $1 billion from the terraUSD/luna ecosystem before it collapsed. (The unnamed company wasn’t accused of wrongdoing.) But sources told CoinDesk that it’s Jump Crypto, which declined to comment.

42393916,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69brc4FF,1677079239,A Day in the Life of a Dev: Ethereum’s Justin Florentine,"The devs never get the spotlight. The devs never get the glory. Without their countless hours of coding, programming, vetting, error-checking, brainstorming, problem-solving and just flat-out doing, nothing in crypto would ever get done. Bitcoin doesn’t exist without devs. When we say that crypto winter is the time for “BUIDLing” (building), what we’re really saying is that this is the time for developers.  Just ask Justin Florentine, a senior protocol engineer for Ethereum, or specifically at Besu, an Ethereum client. (Technically, Florentine works for ConsenSys, which cuts his paycheck.) The work is not glamorous and it is not easy but it gives Florentine a satisfaction he never quite felt in his earlier tech career, which dates back to the 1990s and includes a stint at ESPN.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.""  “It's hard. It's really, really hard,” says Florentine, a 44-year-old family man who lives in Philadelphia. But the rigor is also the reward. “It’s super-fulfilling work from an intellectual capacity,” says Florentine, “and it’s super-fulfilling from a social capacity.” Bonus? You’re “constantly being surrounded by geniuses.”  Too often the world of crypto is abstract, pie in the sky and focused on philosophy and big dreams. So to ground us in the nuts and bolts, Florentine gives a breakdown of what the job of a dev is actually like, and why when he started he was “sh**ting bricks.”  Interview has been condensed and lightly edited for clarity.  Let’s get into your workday. Walk us through it. When do you start?  Justin Florentine: I have a family. I wake up at about 7:30 a.m. and my wife’s already at work. My kid is maybe out the door, maybe not, probably not. He's probably whining about it.  I work from home. I have a dedicated space where I work; it’s a shed in the backyard. So I go out there, I do a little yoga and then check my comms, which is a huge pain in the ass because there’s email, Slack, Discord, Signal, Telegram – a million different communication sectors.  I’ll have a cup of coffee, and while my day is getting started the European team is sitting down for their lunch. I’ll touch base with them and plan the day out.  What does that look like, specifically?  I kind of have these different archetypes of days, honestly. Not every day is the same. If I'm in the zone on something, maybe I sit down and I start programming for two hours at a time, take a break, do something else, then two more hours at a time, etc. On days like that, I'll be turning off a lot of comms and then check in only once at the end of the day.  Other days are a little bit more social, and I have to have conversations with people. And there’s always new code that needs to be reviewed.  Can you elaborate on that?  So, we do everything open source, and it's all hosted on GitHub. And so when somebody has a change that they want to make to the code base, somebody else has to approve it, take a look at it and make sure that it's not doing anything crazy. And that's always good fodder for other conversations that you may have with the other developers, which usually happen over Discord.  I also do a lot of work with the Protocol Guild, and I’m also doing things for the Ethereum Foundation. So there's a lot of different modes you can be in as a developer and maybe kind of jump back and forth.  What time do you call it a day?  Unfortunately, I kind of work better at night so I may take a break mid-afternoon, take a nap and then come back and work a little more after dinner. I'm a big baseball fan. Go Phillies. So in the summer I'm basically listening to a baseball game on the radio every night. And that's actually a really good time to get some work done, because, frankly, baseball can be a little long and boring. But it's great background noise.  At the end of the day, nobody cares when I work, but I try to make myself available in the evenings so I can sync up with the Australian team.  How many hours per week do you work, on average?  I guess anywhere from 40 to 45 or 50, at the most. I’m pretty big on work-life balance, because I’ve [been] bending this for a long time.  See also: Crypto Layoffs: Here's the Grim Count Since April  Crypto is 24/7 and across the globe. How do you handle getting bombarded by inbound messages at all hours of the day?  I mean, that's just knowing how to operate your notifications. That's not a challenge, honestly.  What are the main upgrades and improvements you’re working on?  Our main focus, first and foremost, is keeping up with the Ethereum road map. So, for instance, right now I'm working on EIP [Ethereum Improvement Protocol] 4844, and that is a scaling improvement. That’s going to allow L2s [layer 2 blockchains] to operate a little bit cheaper. Well, a lot cheaper. So those are always at the top of the list.  How do things like assignments, deadlines and decision-making work? Who’s organizing meetings?  It really is very decentralized and organic. So there may be people that work at ConsenSys who say, “Oh, you should work on this.” And we get to say, “Yes, good to know. Thank you for your input. But really we work for Ethereum, the protocol,” and the day-to-day of what we do has a lot more to do with that.  I get this in theory but it’s tough to see it in action. How are you keeping track of things?  So, for instance, how do we organize work? Well, we say, OK, great, here's the schedule. Are we on schedule or are we behind schedule? And we have a constant feedback loop with the rest of the core devs. That's where we get our orders from, I guess, as much as they’re orders.  But, really, it's that rough consensus that we come to through our different social networks where we say, “Yes, this should be included in future upgrades,” or it should not be included in future upgrades. And then the protocol defines the workload. The protocol defines what needs to get done. It's up to us as a team to then decide, all right, who's going to do what.  So it's very flat. It’s very organic. It’s very nonhierarchical. It is virtually meeting-free.  Really, no meetings?  I have a daily meeting with my team, but then on most days I’ll have none other than that daily status meeting. My team is very spread out; I’m in the U.S. on the East Coast. I have a colleague on the West Coast. Then there are five or six in Australia and then another seven or eight in European time zones. So for the most part, everything's done asynchronously.  What’s the social component of the job like? How do you make friends with coworkers and stuff?  Oh, that's a really good question because these are the most impressive people that I've ever worked with. It’s like you’re constantly being surrounded by geniuses. And they're a lot of fun to be around. I do give them a lot of [crap] for being too crypto-focused, though.  What do you mean?  At a gathering like a devcon [developer convention], one of my favorite things to do is call people out and say, “What are you doing with your life outside of crypto?” And they're like, ""What are you talking about? There's nothing outside of crypto."" [Laughs.]  But they're all wonderful people. Super-warm and engaging and really comfortable with disagreeing with each other in a very gentle, professional and productive manner.  What do you like the most about being an Ethereum dev?  Well, number one, I’d say just having to step up. When I got this job I was very scared. I was sh**ting bricks. I was like, man, this is for real, dude. You're working on the second biggest protocol in crypto, with hundreds of billions of dollars secured. And The Merge was coming up, which needed to happen without any downtime. It was kind of bonkers.  But everybody was so welcoming when I got here. And it’s super-fulfilling work from an intellectual capacity, and it’s super-fulfilling from a social capacity. I’ve worked at so many places where they say, ""We’re going to change the world."" And by the time I left it felt like a waste of time. But in the two years I’ve been doing this, we transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake, and that’s a measure contribution to reducing climate change and power usage.  The most challenging part of being a dev?  It's hard. It's really, really hard. Like, really mentally hard. Like, there's so much of Ethereum in general that I still don't understand. I've gotten comfortable with that.  How so?  I’ve kind of settled in to being a little more focused on the [Ethereum Virtual Machine] itself and sort of picking out my battles, because it's so easy to go down a rabbit hole and then look up and see that it’s two in the morning, and now your next day is ruined.  And it’s stressful. There's no two ways about it. Like, being online for The Merge when that was happening, hoping everything would work as well as we tested it.  See also: Ethereum's 2022 in Review: The Merge, MEV and Mayhem  Any other downsides?  It sucks when people give you [crap] for being in crypto. Like, there are so many people who have completely written me off. They’re like, “Oh, you’re now a libertarian blowhard and you’re making magic internet money and destroying the planet.”  But that’s a small price to pay.  What’s it like working during crypto winter? How has the job changed now that the overall industry vibes have kind of soured?  For the people that I care about, their vibes have not soured at all. They're actually really refreshed by it. There’s less noise. The signal-to-noise ratio is much better.  So you guys never think about price?  We do think about price to the degree that we kind of have to plan. It does have impact on the mechanics, or the crypto economics of certain things. There are some things that we have to plan for.  Can you give an example?  For instance, EIP-4844, right? That's going to make [layer 2s] cheaper and more effective. And at the end of last year, gas prices were in the doldrums so we were like, OK, I’m not in a big rush to get 4844 done just to make the L2s happy when gas is cheap.  But we kind of have to be aware that this is all cyclical, and with a bull market comes higher usage and we have to get out in front of that. So we do care about the market cycles in that we try to position upgrades for maximum impact.  How about thinking about crypto prices with respect to job security? If the price of Ethereum crashes, say, are the devs' jobs at risk?  Here's the thing. We work for ConsenSys, and Joe Lubin is dedicated to client diversity. And, honestly, as far as the ConsenSys empire is concerned, we are a small part of that puzzle. We’re a 15-person team, and overall it’s a company of close to 1,000 people. If the price completely craters then I think Ethereum has bigger problems.  Advice for anyone thinking about becoming a dev?  Just do it. Just jump into it. And the number one thing is to expect to be intimidated and be comfortable with that.  Nobody knows what they're talking about 100% [of the time]. You'll meet some of the most terrifyingly brilliant people. Just kind of sit back, listen to them and understand that they're not judging you.  Awesome.

42410832,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtyF,1677077990,Developer Activity Shows Healthy Growth of the Crypto Space,"Crypto developers are doing what they do best: buidling.  The number of weekly active developers has ranged from 6,000 to 7,000 since the start of 2023, according to a dashboard from crypto data firm Artemis.xyz. The number of daily active developers as of Wednesday is near 1,700, according to blockchain analytics firm Token Terminal’s most recent data.  This article is part of CoinDesk’s “BUIDL Week.""  Token Terminal shows developers have pushed roughly 4,500 commits every week this year to public GitHub repositories in the crypto ecosystem. Artemis, on the other hand, shows the number of weekly developer commits to be above 50,000, in the same time period.  Commits is a term for “the smallest unit of work for developers … typically a good proxy for developer productivity,” Artemis says on its web site.  Despite the decline in weekly commits from 2022 to 2023, weekly active developers across the crypto ecosystem have grown steadily over the past three years as there are more active developers in this year’s bear market compared to the bear market in 2020.  Jimmy Zhang, who works in the Business Operations & Strategy department at Artemis, wrote in an email to CoinDesk, “The daily active developers/commits data continues to give us confidence that people are continuing to build in the crypto ecosystem.”  The discrepancy between the Artemis and Token Terminal figures on the number of active developers and code commits may come from how Artemis pulls developer data from core ecosystems and sub-ecosystems, which includes developer building applications on top of individual blockchains. Each year, the number of developers and commits drops during the holidays, suggesting developers take time off for vacation.  According to Artemis, in the week starting on June 6, 2022, when CoinDesk’s Consensus took place in Austin, Texas, about 9,700 developers were active. In the week of Sept. 11, 2022, when Ethereum transitioned to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, roughly 9,200 developers were active, defined as a developer pushing at least one commit during the week.  In the week of Nov. 6, the crypto exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and yet crypto developers pushed 71,200 commits.  See also: Crypto Layoffs: Here's the Grim Count Since April  Some developers are trying to build the “Infinite Garden,” an abundant ecosystem where people nurture growth for the Ethereum protocol, while others are focused on prioritizing cypherpunk ideals in their work. Regardless of what event is currently happening – whether it is a festival that showcases all that crypto has to offer, a major upgrade to a protocol or a company filing for bankruptcy – developers are waking up and developing the crypto ecosystem.  The number of active developers and commits not only highlight the vitality embedded in the crypto space, but also demonstrate how people are trying to have a significant impact in both the physical and digital realms.  “All in all, we believe that the crypto ecosystem is continuing to grow in a healthy manner,” Zhang, from Artemis, added.",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,Sage D.

42414356,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4rHx,1677077148,Bitcoin Volatility Holds Steady as the VIX and MOVE Spike,"The bitcoin (BTC) market is showing an uncanny resilience in the face of renewed investor anxiety on Wall Street.  Data from CryptoCompare shows the Bitcoin Volatility Index (BVIN), which measures the implied or expected volatility over the next 30 days, has remained flat of late near the lower end of its three-month range of 60 to 100. Implied volatility is often equated with the degree of uncertainty or anxiety in the market.  Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) – commonly referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge – has jumped from 18 to 23 over the past three days, reaching a 2023 high.  Alongside, the MOVE index, which measures volatility in U.S. Treasurys, has jumped to a one-month high of 120, ending a four-month downtrend.  Bitcoin's lack of participation in global volatility repricing is reminiscent of the pre-March 2020 days when traditional investors took little interest in digital assets, leaving the crypto market in its own world. Bitcoin only evolved as a macro asset after the crash of March 2020, with BVIN typically closely tracking movements in VIX ever since.  ""We attribute this correlation break to reflect a continued mainstream dis-interest in crypto products, as we return to the fringes of U.S. capital markets and chart our own narratives forward with hopefully more uncorrelated alpha,"" SignalPlus Ltd, a tech firm focused on democratizing crypto options, said in its daily market report.  The most popular narrative since late 2022 is that bitcoin will repeat history by rallying sharply in the months leading up to its fourth mining reward halving due sometime in March 2024. Reward halving refers to a programmed code that reduces the pace of bitcoin's supply expansion by 50% every four years.  ""The conditions are ripe for a breakthrough in 2023 that could catalyze a new bull market,"" San Francisco crypto asset manager Bitwise wrote last month, taking note of the crypto's tendency to rally ahead of the halving. ""We are excited by the growth of layer 2 solutions, the development of ZK-rollups and privacy solutions, and many other emergent capabilities of crypto,"" the team added.  As for the jump in volatility in traditional assets, these markets have turned nervous in response to rates traders – factoring in recent upbeat economic data – quickly reversing bets on potential easing by the Federal Reserve later this year.  Markets were previously certain the Fed would hike its benchmark fed funds rate just 25 basis points in March, but are now showing a 20% probability of a 50 basis point move. The yield on the two-year Treasury note has increased by more than 50 basis points to 4.64% in February. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback's value against major fiat currencies, has bounced from 102.00 to 104.00 as international money flows take advantage of higher yields.  ""The risk of a 'break higher' in the economy with higher prices is a much bigger risk than recession concerns at this juncture,"" SignalPlus said.

The initial Microsoft announcement, under which the two companies offer support to enterprises looking to use blockchain technology, sent price surging to nearly 6 cents from a low of 3 cents.

Trading volume for the ANKR token across all exchanges eclipsed $1.5 billion over the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  The emergence of liquid staking tokens and derivatives as a bullish asset class was spurred by regulatory action against exchanges offering traditional staking, with Kraken immediately shutting all staking products in the U.S. and paying a $30 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Other notable participants in the round included Gnosis, an Ethereum-based project that offers infrastructure and tooling to on-chain users, including its popular multi-signature wallet Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe). Den declined to disclose the full valuation.  ""We build on top of Safe contracts, which currently holds about 5% of all cryptocurrencies,"" said Jonah Erlich, co-founder of Den. Den is also a guardian of SafeDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization that manages Safe, and Erlich and his co-founder Ittai Svidler are delegates of SafeDAO.  Den is building tools that make it easier for crypto projects to fully move their operations on-chain. This includes solving coordination problems when it comes to multi-signature wallets, which often require nine out of 13 or five out of seven designated signers to approve a transaction before it can be executed on a blockchain. The startup is also building tools that make it easier for teams to initiate a transaction and understand what’s going on in a token transfer.  ""We built bots that send out recurring notifications to automate the coordination process,"" said Erlich. “Coordinating is actually the most commonly cited problem. It sounds trivial, but it’s not.”  Erlich and Svidler, both core contributors of the viral hit ConstitutionDAO, experienced the coordination problem firsthand when ConstitutionDAO put in a bid to buy a copy of the U.S. Constitution from Sotheby’s in November 2021. Sotheby’s gave the DAO 48 hours to provide proof of funds in dollars, which required Svidler to execute a single transaction to swap over $40 million of Ethereum in the DAO’s treasury into dollars.  ""We needed nine out of 13 signatures,"" said Svidler, who described ConstitutionDAO’s signatories as ""high-profile crypto celebrities"" who were ""busy people.""  ""I had to run around New York City coffee shops and send Instagram DMs to get a hold of signers,"" Svidler told CoinDesk. ""We barely made the deadline.""  Svidler hopes to streamline the process for future organizations. So far, Den’s current roster of users includes the Ethereum staking protocol Lido, non-fungible token collective PleasrDAO and decentralized finance protocol OlympusDAO, among others.  “We really are focused on serving on-chain teams in whatever form they come in,” said Svidler. “The future is not just DAOs, but more and more traditional teams that are going to be on-chain.""

The plunge was triggered by a single $647,000 market sell order, which prompted a cascade of slippage down to 20 cents.

For Wednesday's $647,000 sell order to trigger a move to the downside of that magnitude meant liquidity was either pulled from the book shortly before the sale was made, or a pricing error failed to account for resting buy orders.

42414365,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4rt6,1677074400,"Decentralized Storage Protocol Starts Beta Testing, Will Allow Users to Buy or Rent Storage","UltronGlow, a storage protocol that offers inexpensive, user-priced decentralized storage options, has started its beta program, the company said Wednesday.  The protocol aims to offer more economical and secure storage services than cloud-based, centralized storage providers like Google and Apple, according to its press release. It also aims to facilitate and expand participation in decentralized storage protocols by allowing users to purchase, lease and rent services from almost any type of computer.  UltronGlow joins an increasingly crowded field of decentralized storage networks, such as Arweave, Filecoin and BNB Greenfield, that have grown in popularity as traditional cloud services face mounting cyber security threats. The Interplanetary File System (IPFS), powered by the Filecoin blockchain, for example, experienced a 15-fold increase in the data stored on its network last year, according to Messari.  UltronGlow has 2,500 storage nodes, offering roughly 183 petabytes of data storage.  The platform is well positioned to carve out a space for itself in the crowded decentralized storage market due to its storage capacity and accessibility, Jason Anderson, chief technology evangelist at Ada Byron Foundation told CoinDesk exclusively.  “The goal is to promote citizen data, where anybody has the ability to rent out [their extra storage] and reap some reward for doing so,” said Anderson.  UltronGlow’s pricing is also more competitive – and flexible – compared to that of more well-known decentralized protocols, Anderson said.  Storage rental prices on UltronGlow are determined by the protocol’s storage owners. Costs usually hover at around 50 cents per terabyte of storage, but users with a high uplink bandwidth, which expedites the rate at which data is transmitted from one place to another, could charge more for their available storage.  The protocol includes a staking-based check on power that aims to keep pricing honest, disincentivize fraud and minimize abuse between storage owners and renters. It works by requiring storage owners to stake a “small amount” of ultron glow (UTG) that will be slashed by the protocol if owners don’t honor their contractual obligations to the renters.  UltronGlow's setup also would discourage bad actors beyond the protocol, such as hackers who might want to steal users’ data, by allowing for data to be spread out among tens of thousands of nodes instead of keeping all the data in one place such as in centralized data storage providers.

The company’s crypto assets shrank sharply, indicating it disposed of more cryptocurrency than it produced, as its main mining pool business appears to have nearly ground to halt. Although BIT Mining’s last quarterly results hardly featured any achievement to cheer, its stock jumped nearly 7% on the day the report was released, probably because the price of bitcoin jumped. The crypto currency miner’s net loss ballooned in last year’s fourth quarter, as it appears to have sharply slowed its main mining pool business to keep down costs. As the crypto winter rages on, there aren’t many ways mining companies can warm investors’ hearts. One thing they can do is continue amassing digital assets using any capital they have left, even as weakness of those currencies causes their losses to balloon. The hope is that the hoarding will pay off if and when spring for the industry finally arrives. For BIT Mining Ltd. ( BTCM ), though, such tactics aren’t really viable as it fast depletes its cash. This means the company is in a helpless situation where it can only hope to hunker down around its fast-disappearing cash pile and hope that spring comes sooner rather than later. BIT Mining’s latest quarterly earnings , released last Friday, illustrate the company’s conundrum quite vividly. Its revenue plunged about 88% year-over-year to just $61 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, the company’s net loss for the three-month period ballooned more than tenfold to about $123 million. For the whole of 2022, the crypto miner’s revenue more than halved to $650 million from the prior year, while its net loss more than tripled to $170 million. Such dismal results are the norm these days for most crypto companies, given the deep slump that has ravaged the industry since last summer. The big problem for BIT Mining is that its main mining business appears to have all but ground to a halt. The company’s digital assets were worth just $15 million at the end of last year, down sharply from $55 million a year earlier. A drop in the value of a crypto miner’s assets alone doesn’t necessarily mean its operations slowed. Obviously, if the prices of cryptocurrencies fall sharply, as they did last year, a portfolio’s overall value could fall even if new assets are added. But that doesn’t seem to be the case for BIT Mining. Its bitcoin holdings at the end of last year shrank more than 36% in number to 289 units, while its stock of ether, which the company is focusing on, decreased about 18% to 4,845 units. The decreases indicate that BIT Mining disposed of more assets than it produced. BIT Mining said it made a net gain of about $2 million from sales of cryptocurrencies in the fourth quarter. What’s not said explicitly, but would be revealing if true, is that the company appears to have pretty much put the brakes on its core mining pool business, which accounts for the bulk of its revenue. Such a sharp slowdown appears to have happened based on the fact that costs associated with that operation dropped 85% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier. The company recognizes the value of new cryptocurrencies minted by its pool operation as revenue, and then pays out mining rewards to pool participants and books those as costs. Those mining rewards make up a big chunk of BIT Mining’s operating expenses. This is why an 84% drop in the company’s operating expenses in the fourth quarter is more worrying than encouraging, since it shows the company is paying far less to its pool mining participants as their activity drops. High energy costs Other costs, such as administrative expenses, pale in comparison to those for the mining operation, and any decreases in those are relatively minor. In other words, BIT Mining can’t really cut costs drastically without sacrificing its main mining pool business, hence our assertion that the plunging costs reflects a big pullback in that operation. Another major cost for crypto miners is energy, whose prices have gone up steeply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. And the more mining a company does, the more computing power it needs and the larger its energy bill will be. Thus, the combination of higher power costs and depressed cryptocurrency prices mean BIT Mining’s losses might only worsen if it ramps up its mining activities, depleting its already-rapidly shrinking cash pile even faster. At the end of last year, its cash and cash equivalents dropped to just $5.4 million from nearly $20 million a year earlier, even though the company raised $9.3 million in a new share sale last August. BIT Mining, which was originally an online lottery ticket seller that transformed into a crypto miner in 2021, does have other operations. It mines its own cryptocurrencies in addition to the pool business. It also makes mining machines and runs data centers. But revenue contributions from these are negligible, and the pool operation accounts for nearly 90% of the company’s total revenue. In a move that only highlights BIT Mining’s desperation to find any other source of revenue, it invested $2.4 million in short-term bonds as of the end of last year – something it had never done in prior years. Probably helped by those investments, the company earned $150,000 in interest income last year. Unlike BIT Mining, some of the world’s largest crypto miners have actually been increasing their activity lately to produce more digital assets. Among them, U.S.-based Riot Platforms ( RIOT ), despite losing money in the first nine months of last year, minted 55% more units of bitcoin last December than a year earlier. It held nearly 7,000 units of the bellwether crypto currency at the end of last year, even after selling about 600 to generate $10 million in December. Another U.S.-based miner, Marathon Digital Holdings ( MARA ), also produced 30% more bitcoin last year than in 2021, even though its net loss ballooned. Although BIT Mining’s last quarterly results hardly featured any achievement to cheer, its stock jumped nearly 7% on the day the report was released, probably because the price of bitcoin jumped. Yet the stock trades at a rock-bottom price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 0.02, a tiny fraction of the 2.8 for Riot and 5.2 for Marathon. Understanding why such a large valuation gap exists doesn’t take rocket science, as BIT Mining appears to be living on borrowed time and could quickly run out of options if the crypto market doesn’t get on a more solid footing soon. The company may find some comfort in the fact that crypto prices appear to have bottomed out and have staged mini rallies lately. Still, whether that marks the start of a new spring for crypto markets remains anyone’s guess, meaning BIT Mining’s fortunes will be up in the air. Disclosure: None.

The document follows the publication of guidelines for digital asset regulation from the country's Ministry of Finance in November. The goal of the central bank's proposed regulations is to allow stablecoin use in the country ""while managing the risk inherent in using them, and adjusting the consumer protections and prudential requirements,"" the document said.  Although the document refers to the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD in May as a motivation for establishing regulations, the recommendations only target stablecoins attached to other assets and backed by collateral, not algorithms. The central bank said algorithmic stablecoins like terraUSD are not used widely for payments, but indicated it may prohibit them if they become too popular.  ""If, nevertheless, this type of currency becomes a common means of payment, issuers will be required to hold full collateral, and in fact the issuance of a bearer currency that uses an algorithmic stabilization mechanism will be prohibited,"" the document said in Hebrew.  The central bank recommends requiring stablecoin issuers to maintain reserves matching the amount of crypto in circulation, covering ""100 percent of its liabilities to the coin holders."" The recommendation aligns with that of other jurisdictions like Hong Kong, which plans to regulate asset-backed stablecoins by June this year.  The recommendations include splitting supervisory roles between multiple regulators to enhance efficiency. The central bank proposes that stablecoins issuers should be required to obtain licenses to operate. It adds that issuers of larger stablecoins that could have ""systemic importance"" should be licensed by the Banking Supervision Department while others should be supervised by the Capital Market Authority.  Payments-focused stablecoins ""shall be overseen by the payment systems oversight function at the Bank of Israel,"" according to the document.  The proposed rules are open to public comment until March 15, after which the bank will make required changes and recommend legislation to the government.

The number of transactions yesterday of 1,103,398 was up from 159,919 at the start of the year, according to Arbiscan. The Ethereum network had 1,084,290 transactions Monday, according to Etherscan. The boosted activity on Arbitrum may be a result of users expecting a potential airdrop, according to Walter Teng of Fundstrat Global Advisors. There have, however, yet to be any plans made or announcements to this effect.  Developers of the Klaytn blockchain have proposed burning 5.28 billion KLAY tokens, amounting to around 48% of the total supply, worth around $1.65 billion. The Klaytn Foundation has submitted this proposal to its governance council with the aim of helping develop Klaytn into a sustainable decentralized network. The 2 billion tokens that remain will be reserved for use cases and scenarios that help to facilitate deflationary economics for KLAY, with the goal of creating long-term value. Voting on the proposal commences today and will continue until Feb. 28.  Google Cloud is to become a validator on the Tezos network, marking the tech giant’s latest integration with a blockchain network following similar moves with Ethereum and Solana late last year. Corporate customers of Google’s cloud computing service will be able to deploy Tezos nodes in order to build Web3 applications on the network. Integrations of this kind should demonstrate the interest tech giants are taking in blockchain and Web3 projects and may promote confidence of other firms looking to move into the industry.  Chart of the Day  The seven-day moving average of the number of bitcoin addresses in profit has risen to the highest since April. Back then, bitcoin traded at $42,000, or 75% higher than the current market price of $24,000.  The data is perhaps reflective of investor accumulation at around $20,000 during the height of the bear market in the second half of last year, according to Matrixport's Markus Thielen.  An address is said to be in profit when the current price of bitcoin is higher than the price at which the address acquired the cryptocurrency.  - Omkar Godbole  Trending Posts  SEC’s Shadow Crypto Rule Taking Shape as Enforcement Cases Mount  Coinbase Q4 Revenue and Earnings Beat Expectations, but Transaction Volume Falls 12% From Q3  It's Time to BUIDL Week",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH | KLAY,BTC | ETH | MARKET | ARB | KLAY,"Jamie Crawley, Omkar Godbole",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/22/first-mover-americas-lido-daos-governance-token-jumps-17,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dca4a39e0f1b391a1bd59e2d6389fbe0bf2d1c87-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The reserve data is aggregated by an accounting firm called The Network Firm LLP and then provided on-chain via Chainlink, according to a press release from Chainlink and Archblock, which supports TUSD.

42414363,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboB4s91,1677070800,Web3 Wallet Bitski Releases New Mobile Wallet and Browser Extension,"Leading Web3 wallet Bitski is rolling out an iOS-compatible mobile application and browser extension to help onboard users to Web3 and non-fungible token (NFT) custody, the company told CoinDesk Wednesday.  The two interfaces showcase features to help facilitate an efficient user experience, while prioritizing safety and security. The update includes nine upgraded features including a wallet activity feed, self-custody support and a decentralized application (dapp) browser.  The aim was to provide people with a friendly experience that also speaks to more experienced NFT collectors and creators with tools like NFT floor price alerts and the ability to see all your NFTs and tokens in your wallet.  Donnie Dinch, CEO and founder of Bitski, told CoinDesk he hopes the latest updates to its wallet will help onboard users to Web3 through its advanced, yet digestible, user interface.  “The reason we're excited about NFTs is less about the technology behind it per se and more about the user experiences and enabling this idea of digital ownership,” said Dinch. “This kind of touches all of the features that we've shipped, which is really to do these things in a human readable way in a way that allows people to have a safe experience navigating Web3.”  One area of focus for Bitski was to focus on removing barriers to Web3 wallets and self-custody such as complicated seed phrases or the need to be able to decipher on-chain data. The activity feed is something Dinch is “super excited about” and was developed so that non-crypto natives can see on-chain transactions in a digestible, clear manner that's intuitive.  While Bitski currently supports Ethereum and sidechain Polygon, Dinch told CoinDesk that the wallet will likely support additional Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible chains in the future.  Bitski gained popularity in November 2019 when the application raised $1.8 million in a seed round led by the Winklevoss twins, crypto exchange Coinbase and investment fund Galaxy Digital. In the wake of the NFT hype in May 2021, the company raised $19 million in Series A from rapper Jay-Z and crypto venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z).

42410819,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1ggrtNs,1677067200,War of Words Over zkEVMs Might Portend Long Struggle to Tech Maturity,"The race to bring the first zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (zkEVM) to market culminated in a meme-laden Twitter spat between two crypto co-founders last week.  Polygon’s Mihailo Bjelic and Matter Labs’ Alex Gluchowski are competing to launch the “first” zkEVM chain to help scale Ethereum. When both co-founders happened to announce major updates to their timelines last week, each of them used the occasion to jab at the security practices of their competitor.  After Gluchowski announced that zkSync Era – the Matter Labs platform – was open-sourcing its code and opening the doors to developer testing on Ethereum’s mainnet, Bjelic accused him of lying about the progress of zkSync’s third-party security audits. Gluchowski, for his part, suggested that Bjelic was avoiding key questions about how Polygon's zkEVM system will work when it launches in March, purportedly the first such platform to come to market.  This article originally appeared in Valid Points, CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter breaking down Ethereum’s evolution and its impact on crypto markets. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.  If anything’s clear from this exchange, it’s that Ethereum’s layer 2 landscape – zkEVMs and other scaling platforms that allow users to transact on Ethereum with greater speeds and lower fees – is still in its early days. While a series of companies are racing to go live, all of the products are likely to have major security caveats when they open up to users.  Ethereum’s layer 2 landscape  Ethereum’s layer 2 rollups are separate blockchains that sit above the base, layer 1 Ethereum chain. These blockchains host apps just like the base Ethereum chain, but they allow users to transact for cheap by bundling up big groups of transactions and then passing them down to the base chain for all-at-once settlement.  Read more: What Are Layer 2s and Why Are They Important?  Ethereum’s core developers envision a future where rollups become the main point of entry for most users. The big selling point for rollups is that they use technology that allows them to “borrow” Ethereum’s security – meaning transacting on the rollup chains should be functionally equivalent to transacting on Ethereum itself. But that’s not really the case yet.  “There are currently a large number of (Optimistic and ZK) rollup projects, at various stages of development,” Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin explained in a developer forum.  “One pattern that is common to almost all of them is the use of temporary training wheels.”  Optimistic rollups, the first rollups to come to market, already process a greater volume of transactions than the main Ethereum blockchain. But as CoinDesk has previously reported, the leading Optimistic roll-ups – Optimism and Arbitrum – have safeguards in place that hinge on the honesty of third parties.  Read more: Ethereum’s Layer 2 Rollups Reduce Costs, but the Risks Are Underappreciated  One example of how third parties come into play is code upgradeability. Due to the relative immaturity of their technology, rollup protocols can be upgraded to fix bugs. While the ability to fix bugs may seem like an obvious necessity, many keystone crypto protocols, like Uniswap, opt to be non-upgradable. This is because upgrades have the potential to introduce additional bugs (see the $190 million Nomad bridge hack) or be exploited by bad actors who then sneak in outright malicious code.  There’s no evidence that Optimism or Arbitrum have ever suffered in a major way as a result of their upgradeability. However, this isn't the only place where they bake in trust assumptions as a matter of bootstrapping. Until these trust assumptions are pared back significantly, using rollup chains won’t actually be synonymous with using the main Ethereum blockchain.  The zkEVM war of words  ZkEVMs are supposed to be a more advanced breed of rollup platform than Optimistic rollups, since they use fancy zero-knowledge cryptography to ensure transaction integrity. But because of their more complex inner workings, they will also come to market with more caveats.  “I presume that long-term all of us will have your Aaves, Uniswaps, and all the standard DeFi applications that have been on Ethereum,” Toghrul Maharramov, senior researcher at the zkEVM startup Scroll, told CoinDesk. “So the question is, how do you stand out? How do you build a unique ecosystem?”  According to Maharramov, “Unless somebody makes a major technical breakthrough and there’s a massive gap between them and everyone else, it’s more about the values you present.”  For Polygon, Matter Labs and other zkEVM builders, security will be a major – if not the major – selling point; hence all of the debate online. But beneath the marketing and social media posturing, says Maharramov, all zkEVMs will face similar security challenges.  The “primary concern” in the short term will be bugs in the bridges that people use to pass funds between Ethereum and the zkEVM chains, says Maharramov. Smart contracts that power crypto bridges have long been a major target for hackers, and in the world of zkEVMs, Maharramov says that “bridge contracts are quite complex and avoiding bugs will be difficult.”  Perhaps more worrisome than bridges, though, is the difficulty of testing zero-knowledge circuits – the cryptography that will power zkEVMs under the hood.  “The technology has evolved drastically throughout the years, so it's not like an established and battle-tested thing,” said Maharramov. Compared to Optimistic rollups, zkEVM code is “much more complex,” and there “are fewer people who can audit that kind of stuff, so it's also going to be more difficult to spot bugs.”  As a result of their security risks, zkEVMs are likely to rely on greater trust assumptions (ie. training wheels) as they mature in comparison to Optimistic rollups. Code will be upgradeable, for instance, and trusted third parties will be able to step in to safeguard against circuit bugs.  As for when any rollup – Optimistic or zkEVM – will be able to take off these training wheels and launch in earnest, Maharramov says it will still be a while.  “I think for Optimistic roll-ups, the path is shorter just because they've been around for a longer time,” he said. “I would expect by next year to have at least protocols that are almost true rollups.”  As for zkEVMs, “I would say two years would probably be somewhere around the mark that I would be comfortable with saying that the tech is mature enough,” he said.",NEUTRAL,없음,ETH | MARKET | MATIC | TECHNOLOGY | ARB,Sam Kessler,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/war-of-words-over-zkevms-might-portend-long-struggle-to-tech-maturity,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/abef987fb70366e87cd53befe9c85b062dab74f2-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The bank raised its price target on Coinbase to $57 from $52, but maintained its neutral rating. At the time of writing, shares of Coinbase were down 1.5% at $61.16 in premarket trading.  “Coinbase is well positioned to deliver notable year-on-year improvement in EBITDA at current expense levels with the marked improvement in overall crypto volumes in 2023 thus far combined with somewhat better than anticipated costs cutting going into 1Q23,” analysts led by Kenneth B. Worthington wrote.  Unsurprisingly, trading volumes remained weak during the fourth quarter, but this was offset by take rates and higher interest income, the report added.  One of the biggest contributors to fourth-quarter revenue was from Coinbase’s relationship with Circle. Subscription revenue continued to grow in the quarter with USD coin (USDC) generating $146 million of interest income for the exchange, the report added.  More importantly, Coinbase said it now aims to generate positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) “in all market conditions,” whereas previously it aimed to operate at EBITDA break-even across each crypto cycle, said JPMorgan.  The bank says this is a notable change given the level of restructuring and “business realignment” in the past several quarters.

Ordinals is a new protocol that allows NFTs to be stored on the Bitcoin blockchain. STX is the native token of the Stacks Network, a layer 2 blockchain that leverages the security of the bitcoin blockchain to settle transactions.  As Ordinals are minted directly onto the blockchain, they are “considered to be digital artifacts due to their permanence and immutability on the distributed ledger,” as opposed to traditional NFTs which can be altered by smart contract developers, wrote Markus Thielen, head of research.  Matrixport notes that the idea of Bitcoin NFTs is not a new concept and has been developed by protocols such as Counterparty and Stacks. The recent hype around Ordinals NFTs led to a 50% rally in STX earlier this week.  The coming together of NFTs and the Bitcoin network brings more security, transparency and traceability. It has opened up more use cases and reignited interest around these tokens, the report said. Last week the number of newly minted Ordinal NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain surpassed 100,000, it added.  “Stack’s ability to leverage the Bitcoin blockchain’s security for settlement of transactions positions the network well for developing Bitcoin decentralized finance (DeFi),” the note said. DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.  The full potential of the Stacks Network is starting to get recognized which could lead to further gains in the STX token, the note added.

The proposal will be voted on by the GC, a group of network participants that currently oversee the governance of the Klaytn network, from Feb. 22 to Feb. 28.  The proposal includes short-term tokenomics improvements: from the initial burning of 73% of the reserve supply, amounting to 5.28 billion KLAY (approximately 48% of the current total KLAY supply), to enhancing transparency in information disclosures and modifying the management structure of ecosystem resources.  Over 75 million KLAY has been burned to date through strategic buybacks and the burning of gas fees. Currently, around 3.073 billion KLAY is in circulation.  Out of the initial minting reserve of 7.48 billion KLAY, the Foundation looks to initially burn 5.28 billion KLAY that has remained unused in the last three years and eight months. Approximately 200 million KLAY that has already been contracted to be paid to GroundX, the subsidiary that developed the Klaytn blockchain, for infrastructure development, network operation and management services will be transparently executed.  The remaining 2 billion KLAY will be designated as the ""KLAY Value Creation Reserve,"" which will only be channeled towards use cases and scenarios that will help facilitate deflationary KLAY tokenomics.  Such tokenomics are intended to create long-term value for KLAY tokens. “The Foundation looks to increase KLAY demand in a few ways: first, increasing on-chain interactions by collaborating with major portfolio projects as well as fostering services within the Klaytn ecosystem, especially dapps that look to ‘use and burn’ KLAY as their main tokenomics model,” Klaytn said in the proposal.  The foundation added it aims to increase the utility of KLAY beyond transaction fees by securing infrastructure services that are necessary for the ecosystem, such as oracles, as well as investing in high-growth potential projects necessary for the Klaytn ecosystem, such investments will channel returns back to the ecosystem and leverage said returns to expand KLAY demand.",POSITIVE,KLAY,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | KLAY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/02/22/klaytn-foundation-proposes-burning-528b-klay-in-tokens-overhaul-cutting-token-supply-by-nearly-50,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/6512bb86380495954d8e837011052e96f9dccfdf-1280x960.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of other assets like sovereign currencies, do not benefit from the regulatory requirements and protections that apply to bank deposits, Carstens, who leads the association of central banks from around the world, said while speaking at the Monetary Authority of Singapore.  Regulators and lawmakers the world over were skeptical of these cryptocurrencies even before the shocking collapse of algorithmic stablecoin ecosystem Terra in May – that set off a wider crypto market collapse and a string of high profile bankruptcies in the industry. This year, global standard setters have warned many existing stablecoins may not meet the tough standards they have planned for issuers.  Carstens – who had previously criticized stablecoins because of prevailing concerns they could shift power over monetary systems away from central banks to private entities that are ""driven by profit"" – instead praised tokenized deposits and central bank digital currencies that take advantage of the technologies tied to crypto but preserve the ""trust"" offered by public systems.  ""However, there is an important lesson to be taken from stablecoins from a public policy perspective,"" Carstens added. ""Stablecoins arose in part because some of the technical capabilities they provide cannot currently be met by existing forms of money.""  Central banks must therefore engage with new technologies and look to innovate, or the private sector ""will step in"" according to Carstens. In 2021, the BIS signaled for central banks around the world to start exploring national digital currencies. Now, more than 100 jurisdictions around the world are considering whether to issue digital versions of their sovereign currencies.

The number of daily transactions on the Arbitrum, the fourth-largest blockchain overall in terms of total value locked (TVL), jumped from 159,919 in daily transactions on Jan. 1 to over 1,103,398 at the time of press, representing a roughly 590% increase in less than two months, according to block explorer Arbiscan.  In comparison, the number of daily transactions on Ethereum increased a meager 46% in the same period to 1,084,290, per Etherscan.  Moreover, the number of unique addresses on Arbitrum’s network has reached an all-time high of about 2.95 million addresses, and data from TVL aggregator DeFiLlama shows that Arbitrum’s total value locked jumped 81% since Jan. 1 to roughly $1.85 billion.  Arbitrum’s move ahead of Ethereum follows GMX, a decentralized perpetual exchange native to Arbitrum, overtaking Ethereum in daily fees last week. The growing layer 2 ecosystem has also seen many financial applications emerge like Camelot, Vela Exchange and Radiant Capital, which have all seen their users and transactions increase by over 100% in the past 24 hours, per Nansen data.  Despite Arbitrum’s boost in transactions and addresses, Arbitrum is still lagging behind Ethereum in terms of network fees.  At press time, Ethereum’s one-day fees stand at $6.7 million, while Arbitrum’s one-day fees sit at roughly $154,000, which is less than 2.3% of Ethereum’s network fees for the day, according to cryptofees.info.

Bankman-Fried's attorneys told a judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California is in a filing that case law holds this specific type of subpoena must be personally delivered to the named individual, not left in the care of someone else.  Lawyers for Voyager’s creditors are investigating the attempt by the FTX exchange Bankman-Fried once ran to bail out crypto lender Voyager Digital when it filed for bankruptcy protection in July.  The specific type of subpoena in question is called a Rule 45 subpoena, which commands the named individual to produce designated documents for inspection and copying. These types of subpoenas are used to procure records and documents used in court cases.  “Leaving the Subpoena in the possession of Barbara Fried does not satisfy the Rule’s requirement for personal service on Mr. Bankman-Fried. Substitute service is generally not permitted to serve a Rule 45 subpoena,” according to Bankman-Fried's attorney, citing prior precedent from a number of cases.  The lawyers' filing added the subpoena places an undue burden on Bankman-Fried because it gives him only one business day to produce 49 separate documents, and a four-day notice to appear. The subpoena was served before the President’s Day three-day holiday weekend.  Compliance with the subpoena would also potentially violate Bankman-Fried’s Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution, which protects against self-incrimination.  “Each of the document requests calls for documents that may be relevant to the Criminal Case, in which loans by and to Alameda are at issue,” according to Bankman-Fried's attorneys. “The requested production would entail reviewing a large volume of material and making judgments about their responsiveness – a process that could be deemed to constitute an incriminating testimonial act in the Criminal Case.”  Voyager’s creditors are due back in court in New York on Feb. 22 for another hearing.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/22/sam-bankman-frieds-lawyers-move-to-squash-voyager-subpoena,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/7487a6f8fd2c3c1138d0b10b0bb1d1134d910d6c-1145x644.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42412827,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Pu2,1677035716,"Solana-Themed Storefronts Close Shop, Ending Experiment in IRL Blockchain Evangelism","Solana Spaces, a company that used storefronts in New York City and Miami to pitch adoption of its namesake blockchain, said in a tweet Tuesday it will close its locations by the end of the month.  The startup reached “an inflection point” in the past two months and will pivot away from brick-and-mortar experiences and into non-fungible tokens (NFT), CEO Vibhu Norby said in the tweet. He indicated Solana Spaces will rebrand itself as DRiP, a boutique NFT distribution platform created by Norby, which he also promoted in his stores.  The closure comes seven months after Norby opened Solana Spaces’ first location in a glitzy mall in New York City’s Hudson Yards. Its staffers guided visitors through interactive stations that taught them how to get going on Solana, from setting up a crypto wallet to swapping tokens on a decentralized exchange. Norby later set up a second shop in Miami.  Some 60,000 total visitors came to the stores over six months and they completed 16,000 onboarding tutorials, according to a spokesperson for the Solana Foundation, which gave Norby a grant to help Solana Spaces launch. The spokesperson said the Foundation had no financial stake in the company.  Rather than selling a product, Solana Spaces pitched its storefront as an interactive billboard for crypto brands like FTX, Phantom and Orca that paid for exposure to mainstream audiences. Their advertising dollars paid for Solana Spaces operations; when the FTX exchange imploded it shook the company, but Norby insisted Solana Spaces could still sustain itself using his so-called “retail-as-a-service” (RaaS) model.  Just over a year ago, Norby’s first attempt at RaaS, the tech gadget-focused store b8ta, closed its doors after failing to reach a deal with its landlords. Solana Spaces’ New York location inhabited a former b8ta storefront.  Norby said he closed Solana Spaces’ brick-and-mortar operations because the behind-the-scenes administrative operations proved too burdensome and the potential for growth was too small.  “It’s a little less about the economics and more about where I thought this was going in the future,” Norby said.

42412835,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl6Q1W,1677031056,First Mover Asia: Deconstructing Crypto's China Narrative,"Good morning. Here’s what’s happening:  Prices: Bitcoin can't seem to break past the $25K mark. But when it does, $30K is the next important milestone. Here's why.  Insights: Some of crypto's China narrative is old, some of it is new. Is the market treating this irrationally?  Prices  $30,000 is Bitcoin's Next Important Milestone  CoinDesk Market Index (CMI) 1,130 −6.2 ▼ 0.5% Bitcoin (BTC) $24,405 −404.6 ▼ 1.6% Ethereum (ETH) $1,661 −39.3 ▼ 2.3% S&P 500  3,997.34 −81.8 ▼ 2.0% Gold  $1,845 +4.8 ▲ 0.3% Nikkei 225  27,473.10 −58.8 ▼ 0.2% BTC/ETH prices per CoinDesk Indices, as of 7 a.m. ET (11 a.m. UTC)  Bitcoin is lingering around $24,400 as Asia begins its business day, down 1.6% in the last 24 hours. Ether has also experienced a slight correction too, down 2.3% to $1,661.  Some of the ""China coins"" that surged over the last week are also seeing a slight correction. Conflux (CFX), which is up a staggering 485% during the last week, is down 4.7% on the day.  Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist at Verified Investing, says the China narrative continues to be what’s attracting new bitcoin buyers.  “The big question is, in spite of interest rates going up and the dollar gaining strength, is there a catalyst that can push it over [$25,000]?” he said during an interview on CoinDesk TV. “I think this narrative out of Hong Kong could be something that helps.”  Soloway points to the 200-weekly moving average as being $25,000, which creates a strong resistance level with some headwinds.  “If we can punch through $25,000 and get above that level, it’s a straight shot to $30,000,” he said.  That figure is important because in 2021, he says, $30,000 was the midpoint low for the year. Prices came down from an April 2021 high of $60,000 to $30,000 at the end of July before rallying back to around $69,000 in November.  “If we can retrace and get back above $30K, that would solidify that the lows are in for crypto,” he said. “I still think that there are some nervous issues out there the market has to resolve, but $30K being recaptured would put that to rest.”  Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Avalanche AVAX +2.4% Smart Contract Platform Stellar XLM +0.6% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Polygon MATIC −5.4% Smart Contract Platform Decentraland MANA −4.6% Entertainment Gala GALA −4.5% Entertainment  Insights  Any token that’s China-related is currently off to the moon.  Conflux (CFX) has risen 467% during the last week, according to CoinGecko data, while NEO is up 51% and filecoin (FIL) is up 60%.  The ""China narrative"" has been used to sell the next bull market.  But what exactly is this narrative?  Some of it is new, some of it is old. And some of it is more hype than substance.  Hong Kong and retail crypto traders  Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is starting a consultation process for licensing crypto exchanges to serve retail investors. The SFC spent the last few years working on a consultation plan for Professional (accredited) investors, which goes live on June 1.  Stablecoins are also set to be regulated in the city, and it's likely that they will be using locally incorporated institutions and trusts.  CoinDesk has asked Tether, Circle and Paxos if they would be interested in applying to be regulated under Hong Kong’s proposed stablecoin regime – so far none have responded.  Don’t expect super-leveraged crypto degeneracy when this launches. Regulators are talking about things like ""approved tokens"" and ""risk profile."" This is likely going to be a controlled, calm walled garden of crypto.  Crypto is already widely available in China  Officials from China’s Liaison Office are apparently interested in Hong Kong’s progress with crypto, and have been reportedly stopping by conferences and meetups in the City.  Some say that this is a blessing. China can study Hong Kong’s approach to crypto much like it learned from Hong Kong about open markets.  Still, there is no shortage of crypto available in China, through domestic payment rails.  Both OKX and Binance offer active over-the-counter crypto markets for USDT, ether, bitcoin and other major cryptos. Payment is done via WeChat or a domestic bank transfer.  Anyone who wants crypto in China already has it.  Conflux and blockchain SIMs  Part of Conflux’s sharp rise has been attributed to its announcement that it is working with China Telecom to build blockchain-based SIM cards, complete with all the Web3 terminology to get people excited like metaverse and proof of work.  But Blockchain SIM cards aren’t anything new. This isn’t China Telecom’s first attempt at it.  Back in 2018, China’s telecoms started to explore blockchain technology. In 2019, China Telecom began pitching the idea of a blockchain SIM with the buzzwords of the day: internet of value, internet of things, 5G. A deck advertising the technology from 2020 talked about how digital ledgers could help carriers reconcile billings.  A spokesperson for China Telecom didn’t respond to a request for more technical details by press time.  Around the same time, Verizon won a patent for a blockchain-based SIM card it was calling vSIM. Verizon’s exact approach didn’t win out, and what it was describing has become eSIMs.  It’s also important to remember the Conflux operating within China isn’t the same Conflux you access with the CFX token.  The version of Conflux that has been funded by various provincial governments in China, such as Hunan and Shanghai’s city government, doesn’t have a token and uses a made-in-China encryption protocol. The same team is behind it, and the tech is mostly the same, but China’s version of the chain doesn’t touch the global version.  Tony Ling, a China-based partner at Bizantine Capital, calls Conflux a “one country, two systems” blockchain, noting that its chain and performance is strong but development has been restricted due to compliance with domestic policy.  “It has no [cryptocurrency] in China, it may be somewhat different from traditional public chains,” he said. “Conflux is the only public chain recognized by the government in China.”  What’s old is new again  Finding the catalyst for China’s crypto boom is tough.  Hong Kong allowing retail crypto is a long way off. Authorities there are only in the consultation stage, and even when it launches it's going to be a controlled environment.  That said, crypto is already widely available in China, albeit through gray channels like OTC desks. But it’s as simple as using a virtual private network to access Binance or OKX then completing a transaction with WeChat Pay.  Conflux has been around for a while. Blockchain SIMs aren’t a new idea and haven’t yet taken off.  Maybe it’s just the economy? China’s ""home team"" tokens are rising because the stock market is up.  Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at Oanda, outlined this thesis in an earlier interview with CoinDesk.  “The bullish case for the Chinese economy remains solid, and the likely release of stimulus over the next couple of months as it gathers pace could supercharge that,” he told CoinDesk in an email. “Domestic demand is going to be the cornerstone of the economic revival, and policymakers appear poised to unleash that to its full potential.”  The Hang Seng Index is up 4% in the last six months as the market looks forward to China’s post-COVID-19 reopening and domestic consumption coming back.
