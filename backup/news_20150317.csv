42398265,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Jz,1426627832,Coinapult Claims $40k Lost in Hot Wallet Compromise,"One of the longest-operating bitcoin startups has suffered a hot wallet attack that resulted in the loss of 150 BTC, or roughly $42,900 at press time.  Founded by Ira Miller and investor Erik Voorhees in 2012, Coinapult announced the compromise on Twitter, advising customers to refrain from sending bitcoin to Coinapult addresses until the problem is resolved.  Coinapult COO and CFO Justin Blincoe stressed that the hot wallet was used only for funds owned by the bitcoin wallet and service provider, and that no customer funds were affected.  Blincoe told CoinDesk:  “Our team is looking into all possible scenarios in regards to what happened.”  The hack is the latest in a string of high-profile breaches at exchanges including Bitstamp and CAVirtex, with the later ceasing its operations after password hashes and two-factor authentication details were lost.  Customers that may have sent funds to the hot wallet since it was compromised or who have more specific questions, Blincoe said, can contact Coinapult directly at support@coinapult.com.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/17/coinapult-claims-40k-lost-in-hot-wallet-compromise,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png
42398284,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbT5Yk,1426623822,Whale Club: The Trading Room That Loves Bitcoin Price Declines,"“How much is he dumping?”  The phrase comes to surface amid a collection of voices, most discussing the unknown trader. The room focuses on his (or her) observable market influence, dissecting how and why he closed all his short positions for signs of strategy.  “He was defending that position,” one of the voices says with authority. “That price should have gone up on the ratio, it didn't. I think it was him dumping.”  Whether he's Clowncontrol, Gregcron or Barry White, or one of a host of other usernames that dot the screen, is unclear.  Salacious talk aside, it’s a boring day in the Whale Club trading room. Bitcoin is trading at $250, up from $230 days before. The rise has been the first jolt in an otherwise “choppy” cycle for the price of bitcoin, weeks of ups and downs with no clear trading patterns to yield profits.  “It's been out since Monday,” one of the traders interjects amidst sudden silence, clearly bored by bitcoin’s stability. Debate ensues over the hit Netflix series House of Cards.  For a moment, it could be any Wall Street break room.  “Look at this one-minute candle, holy [expletive]!” exclaims another voice. Just as quickly, Whale Club is back to business.  Open secret  Though the rise of a secretive group may be business as usual for the bitcoin community, Whale Club has built up an unusually polarizing reputation.  The informal club of traders is at once reviled in public for its perceived shadowy market practices and heralded in private by exchanges for knowledgeable product insights.  At any given time, traders can be heard on Whale Club’s TeamSpeak channel, discussing market movements and strategy. Notable members of the exchange industry, including Bitfinex’s Phil Potter and BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes, are known to stop by to get a gauge on market activity.  Others like soon-to-be-incarcerated bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem have made special appearances.  Group leaders like BTCVIX and Flibbr are aware of its more negative reputation, but believe that much of this sentiment has been an unfair byproduct of its name (the term ‘whale’ denoting traders that are large enough to move markets for their own benefit), as well as what they deem a lack of education in the bitcoin community about market dynamics.  As for how the group is viewed by exchanges, the answers differ based on the company. Some are fans and members, while others downplay any relationship.  Bitcoin derivatives exchange BitMEX is a vocal advocate, with CEO Arthur Hayes and CTO Sam Reed both defining themselves as members. Calling the community a “very important segment of the market”, Hayes and Reed confirmed that they use Whale Club's insights to shape decisions.  OKCoin  indicated that while employees may be associated with the group, it doesn’t have any formal relationship with Whale Club.  Zane Tackett, OKCoin’s former community outreach director, said that though he has been in contact with the group, no special emphasis was put on its feedback during his tenure.  “I would say the thing that makes them more noteworthy would simply be they seem to reach out to exchanges and trading services on a much more regular basis,” he said, adding:  ”They can be abrasive I guess. And they also are quite vocal.""  Bone to pick  If there’s one thing that bothers the traders behind Whale Club, it’s the one-directional discussion about bitcoin price, and their views on the subject may paint a picture of why they sometimes offend the sensibilities of the general market.  Contrary to what you may read in the media, bitcoin’s volatile price is one of its biggest benefits to certain subsections of the community.  Apart from its use as a spending tool, bitcoin is an asset class, meaning it trades on the open market. Exchanges have spent the last year moving to offer an increasing variety of tools for traders, and this includes the ability to short or long the market. Whichever direction it goes, there’s money to be made.  “It was like I was given a second birthday in the same year,” Flibbr, 29, recalls, talking about the digital currency’s stunning year-over-year decline, and its more recent “capitulation”, falling under $200 at the start of 2015.  “The downtrend has been fantastic for profits,” he boasted.  “People have made a lot of money on the up run, I’ve made more with leverage on the downtrend,” he adds, not quite hiding his excitement with a giddy tone. “The initial run from $800 down was insane, but then we went all the way up to $700 and repeated the whole process again!”  Perhaps as a nod to its reputation, Flibbr first quips that the group requires users to hold 500 BTC ($143,000 at press time). It takes him a few seconds to note the joke doesn’t resonate.  “We’re zero barrier to entry,” BTCVIX, a former hobbyist options trader, counters. “We call it Whale Club, which has this allure of being very exclusive, but we’re very open. If people want to come in, they can join.”  Whale Club’s origins  Despite claiming 200 traders from 30 countries, Whale Club has only been around for about a year. First connecting on stock and forex chart analysis site TradingView, future members began to look toward alternatives that would provide the feeling of a real trading room floor.  BTCVIX credits the 2009 documentary Floored as part of the inspiration, calling it “a story of the dying breed of floor traders who can’t make the transition to the desk”.  Still, he believes the TeamSpeak channel is about more practical matters than nostalgia. “In a profession where information processing and dissemination is king, the fastest medium wins,” he said.  Today, Whale Club says it has no idea as to its own influence in the market, citing this as a testament to the anonymity the group offers. “Some people are on there playing with bitcoin dust, 0.25 BTC or 0.5 BTC, but there are other traders with hundreds or thousands of bitcoins,” BTCVIX said.  The group has a Vaughn Live TV channel, as well, allowing anyone access to its TeamSpeak room, factors they say make them open to the public.  ""We’re not all betting the same way,"" he said.  Controversy follows  It wasn’t long before this attitude raised eyebrows and spurred accusations. Still, BTCVIX and Flibbr dismiss criticisms of the community, attributing the backlash to the relative newness of trading to younger bitcoin owners.  “They’ve taken the trade, they’re wrong on the trade and their ego is not able to process being wrong, so rather saying ‘Hey I was wrong’ … they instead lash out and want to blame people,” BTCVIX argues.  Indeed, the group’s worst critics have sought to associate Whale Club with market manipulation, a charge that the group also dismisses due for similar reasons. It also fires back, in its own tongue-in-cheek way, naming its various chat channels ""Collusion room"" or ""Conspiracy room"" in nods to controversies.  Both BTCVIX and Flibbr attest to doing “very well” as full-time bitcoin traders, though they are hesitant to provide details.  On a good week, such as when bitcoin plunged in January, BTCVIX attests to earning 100 BTC (about $20,000). This sum, he said, can outpace what he’s likely to earn over the next two or three months, during the “choppier periods” when the market has no direction.  Flibbr admits to keeping small positions of about 50 BTC ($10,000 at press time) to “keep himself occupied”, but also spoke out against the idea that trading is an easy occupation.  “Trading bitcoin is incredibly hard work, it’s 24/7. You have Asia open, you have London hedge fund kill zone. You have New York, East Coast, West Coast, so you’re constantly sleeping with price alarms set,” he said.  This active work has turned Whale Club into a kind of thriving community of friends. Flibbr and BTCVIX admit to becoming more than acquaintances based on “the shear amount of time” they spend on TeamSpeak.  At the very least, the group shares a sense of commonality, describing their influence as follows when asked about their interests beyond bitcoin.  “Degenerate gamblers aspiring to get rich, quit their jobs, drive Lambos and bang [expletive]. I tried to dress it down but the room agreed unanimously on that description,” BTCVIX said, adding that other interests of members include, UFOs, swans and Asian fetishes.  Liquidity boost  In contrast to the perception of their critics, BTCVIX and Flibbr both look at themselves as bitcoin enthusiasts.  The two suggested that they are limited in programming talent, and are simply helping bitcoin by contributing to a more liquid market in a way that best uses their skills and background.  The members of Whale Club, he asserts, aren’t separate from the bitcoin ecosystem. Flibbr claims to have lost money in the Mt Gox collapse, and BTCVIX said he is sympathetic to the calls from the community for decentralised alternatives to the current exchanges.  However, he said that Whale Club and any active traders who love bitcoin’s volatile market will be willing to trade no matter the solution.  “Ultimately it’s about price discovery and liquidity. If the idealists want to have their Amazon accepting bitcoin, they’re going to need a very liquid market,” BTCVIX said, adding:  “We can’t just snap our fingers and have it be that way.”  Image via Whale Club",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/17/whale-club-the-trading-room-that-loves-bitcoin-price-declines,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a12c7f321a959e63f826c3f7df4f20f3d9a8e7c1-1267x545.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378076,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M20J,1426613611,Overstock Reveals Items Most Often Bought With Bitcoin,"Online retail giant Overstock has released new insight into the buying behavior of its bitcoin customer base, revealing bed sheets have become the demographic’s favorite item to purchase.  The top five items bought on Overstock with bitcoin are now sheets, donations to non-profits, headphones, cases and holders, and area rugs, respectively. Cables and tools, mattresses, coffee tables, A/V cables and fashion sunglasses round out the top 10 categories.  Addressing the findings, Overstock director of communications Judd Bagley commented on the relatively mundane list of items as evidence of the program’s overall success.  Bagley told CoinDesk:  “The only thing that makes that list interesting is the fact that it’s so unremarkable. I guess bitcoiners are regular people.”  The remaining top 50 items show everyday items such as bath towels and comforter sets ranking above tech fare such as USB flash drives and micro SD cards.  Overstock’s data suggests it has been successful in winning regular spending from the bitcoin demographic, a trend it first discussed last August.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC,Pete Rizzo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2015/03/17/overstock-reveals-items-most-often-bought-with-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9fb6b7e3a0b193e549891e816385b811cf5ce9df-1269x529.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
42378091,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX7M2FP,1426603009,Bitcoin Billboard Wins Tel Aviv Hackathon,"Over 20 hours of hacking at the Decentralize This! hackathon in Tel Aviv has resulted in the creation of bitcoin's own Million Dollar Homepage – among many other interesting projects.  From Thursday evening until far into Friday afternoon, over 50 programmers spent more than 20 hours brainstorming, conceptualizing and coding at the first Decentralize This! hackathon in the city's Lool Venture Capital offices.  The event was the biggest bitcoin-related hackathon organized in this growing Middle Eastern bitcoin hub to date, with 14 teams building original bitcoin applications in less than a day's time – 10 of which made it to the finish line with a functioning product.  Maya Zehavi, who organized the hackathon alongside Reuven Palatnik, hopes the progressive technological atmosphere for which “start-up nation” Israel has made a name during the past decade will continue to gravitate towards the crypto space, and believes the Decentralize This! hackathon could contribute to this process.  “Like many others, we are disillusioned by the financial sector, and tech tools like bitcoin can help us battle this heavily concentrated industry,” Zehavi explained to CoinDesk, adding:  “But in order to do that effectively we need to bring in new users. The aim of this hackathon, therefore, is to create applications that make bitcoin more accessible in a way that attracts these new users.”  With the significant turnout, and a balanced mixture of bitcoin veterans and coders new to the scene, it seems this goal was certainly accomplished.  The judging panel comprised of early-stage investor Gigi Levy-Weiss, BlockTrail's Ruben de Vries, Lool VC's Yaniv Golan, VC firm Aleph's Eden Shochat, Ernst & Young's Yoram Tietz and myself.  Innovative offerings  The Israeli hacker community demonstrated its innovative side during the day long hacking event, as the hackathon's final entries added up to an impressive list of projects, although most of them are of course still at a proof of concept stage given the relatively short time the programmers had to hack them together.  These final projects included a decentralized and provably fair gambling platform, a functional “oracle” for smart contracts built on top of the bitcoin blockchain, a pay-per-second payment channel for video streaming, a personalized wallet app including budgeting software, a decentralized public land registry, a multi layered affiliate coupon marketing scheme, an automated dependency market, a personalized tipping application for content creation on the web, and – as a runner up winning 10,000 nis ($2,500) – a user friendly cold storage solution.  Picked by the judges and the audience as the winner of the grand prize of 20,000 nis ($5,000) provided by the event's API-provider and main sponsor BlockTrail, was the gimmicky yet potentially effective Blockchain Billboard.  This Blockchain Billboard is essentially a play – or perhaps an improvement – on the Million Dollar Homepage, the 10-year-old Internet phenomenon that sold a million pixels on a webpage for one dollar each, hence collecting (little over) a million US dollars.  As opposed to the Million Dollar Homepage, however, the Blockchain Billboard uses some of bitcoin's programmable functionality in order to establish a much more dynamic concept.  The webpage, for instance, can never be sold out completely, like the Million Dollar Homepage has been for almost 10 years now. Instead, buyers of pixels won't merely buy and colour their pixels for one time only, but will instead be able to set a new price for the pixel, hence automatically reselling it to whomever sends bitcoin to the corresponding bitcoin address.  As such, after the initial one million pixels are sold, the website might keep changing forever, since a marketplace for the limited amount of pixels on the webpage will continue to exits.  “This could lead to all sorts of interesting situations,” one of the winning team members, Jonathan Rouache, explained, adding:  “Instead of a static webpage, we might now see battles of the brands plastering their names over each other or perhaps even skewing each others logo's. Alternatively, you might be able to effectively create animations on the website, or possibly even play weird kinds of games.”  Zehavi said one of the determining factors for the judging panel was the ""inherent virality"" of the Blockchain Billboard, which might introduce the technology to a whole new set of users.  “We're happy we were able to bring together such a widespread group of people who are passionate about blockchain technology. We hope to organize another event maybe next year, hopefully there will be even more people, and the concept of decentralized services will be more widespread by then,"" she concluded.  The Blockchain Billboard is set to go live later this week.

Often considered a rival to Amazon, Rakuten has also confirmed plans to roll out bitcoin integration to both its German and Austrian e-commerce sites.  Yaz Iida, president of Rakuten USA, said the company's mission was to ""empower the world through the Internet"". He added:  ""Not only can bitcoin support this vision by helping our merchants to compete globally, but it also has the potential to benefit society by enhancing the security, privacy, and convenience of financial transactions.""  Speaking about the integration, John McDonnell, co-founder and CEO at Bitnet, said that they were excited to join with Rakuten in helping both merchants and shoppers reap the benefits of this new technology.  He added: ""Rakuten's global marketplaces are great examples of how digital currencies can impact global commerce.""  Interest in bitcoin  The news comes after Rakuten's CEO, Hiroshi Mikitani, one of Japan's wealthiest individuals, announced his company was considering accepting bitcoin just last month.  Rakuten is not new to the bitcoin space. The Wall Street Journal previously reported that the e-commerce giant had formed a department to study digital currencies and had invested in US-based bitcoin ventures such as Bitnet.    The Tokyo-based company employs over 14,000 people and operates 40 businesses worldwide. The company is expanding worldwide and currently operates throughout Asia, Europe, the Americas and Oceania.      In Japan it operates a bank, an insurance company and even a professional baseball team.
