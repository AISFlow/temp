37606756,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26393,1734133980,"Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR) Solana Memecoin to Rally 16,000% Before Exchange Listing, As SHIB, BONK and DOGE Fall","Trump’s Tariffs could turn early investors into multi-millionaires, like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) did. Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-as-shib-bonk-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37606506,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374548,1734133506,This Altcoin Exploded by 300% After Changpeng Zhao (CZ) Tweeted About It,"A recent endorsement by former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) of the blockchain-driven travel platform Travala has skyrocketed its AVA token by more than 300% in the last 24 hours. The surge also follows a series of announcements, including new market listings and milestone achievements for the company. CZ’s Influence On December 11, Travala reported that its annual revenues had reached $100 million, up from $59.6 million in 2023. This achievement was made possible by the growing demand for flight and hotel bookings paid using crypto. It also coincided with the firm’s disclosure of a new strategy: It intends to hold a portion of its treasury reserve in AVA and Bitcoin in the manner popularized by Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy . However, Zhao’s December 12 post on X highlighting his firm’s early investment in Travala, dating back to the pre-COVID era, tipped the scales, getting the market excited and fueling investor curiosity. Hailed as one of the “OG of Crypto” by some X users, Zhao’s influence within the blockchain and crypto sector is well-documented . By drawing attention to Binance’s early involvement, he not only reinforced Travala’s credibility but also signaled its potential for long-term growth – at least that’s how the market took it based on the price’s performance. According to the social metrics platform LunarCrush, CZ’s post, viewed more than 1.3 million times, caused a marked rise in AVA-related social activity. As a result, it experienced an explosive 350% price rally, jumping from $0.75 to a peak of $3.38 in just one day. Performance and Outlook At the time of this writing, the token was still almost 310% higher than its level from 24 hours ago. Its current price also represents a 286.6% improvement over seven days and an even more impressive 541% jump over 30 days. Additionally, it registered a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $890 million per data from CoinGecko, a 28,436% increase across the period, highlighting the catalytic nature of CZ’s post. With a circulating supply of 56.3 million units, each costing over $3.00, AVA now boasts a nearly $172 million valuation, placing it at #445 on the list of cryptocurrencies with the largest market caps. The token has massively outperformed the broader crypto market, which is down 2.20% in the last seven days, and similar Ethereum ecosystem assets, which are up 12.7% on average.

Is it the technology, the community, or the potential returns for early investors? While the market evolves, three projects have captured the spotlight: Filecoin, EOS, and the innovative newcomer Qubetics ($TICS). These projects bring unique opportunities and updates, but Qubetics has generated a different buzz than any of them, particularly with its groundbreaking Web3 infrastructure and Top Crypto Presale to buy. Recent updates highlight exciting predictions for Filecoin and the potential of EOS. However, Qubetics takes centre stage with its ambitious plans, cutting-edge decentralised VPN service, and highly rewarding presale. This article will delve into the latest developments for all three projects, focusing on Qubetics and why it’s the most compelling opportunity for savvy investors. How Qubetics dVPN Is Changing the Game for Online Privacy Qubetics is making waves with its Web3 ecosystem, and a key highlight is its decentralised VPN (dVPN) . Unlike traditional VPNs that often log user data or are prone to censorship, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to ensure true privacy and security. Creating a peer-to-peer network eliminates centralised control, offering unrestricted and anonymous internet access. What makes this unique? First, the decentralised architecture ensures no single entity can control or compromise your data. This model provides unmatched transparency and censorship resistance. Additionally, users providing bandwidth are incentivised with $TICS tokens, transforming the service into a self-sustaining marketplace. Advanced features like multi-hop routing and end-to-end encryption further enhance privacy and security. Recently, Qubetics hosted an AMA session , connecting directly with its community to answer questions and share updates. This initiative underscores the project’s commitment to transparency and user engagement. With its dVPN, Qubetics isn’t just improving privacy—it’s setting a new standard for secure, decentralised internet access. Could this be the Top Crypto Presale to buy for those seeking long-term growth? Filecoin: Powering Decentralised Storage Solutions Filecoin continues to lead in decentralised storage, offering a secure and efficient alternative to traditional cloud providers. By enabling users to rent out unused hard drive space, Filecoin rewards participants with FIL tokens. This system, built on proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime mechanisms, ensures data reliability and long-term storage. Looking ahead, market analysts predict a steady price climb for Filecoin. By 2024, FIL is expected to average $17.28, with projections of $35.70 by 2027 and $58.80 by 2030. These forecasts highlight Filecoin’s potential as a long-term investment in the decentralised Web3 infrastructure. EOS: A High-Potential Altcoin for 2024 EOS offers a versatile blockchain platform for decentralised applications (dApps) and smart contracts. As Bitcoin sets the stage for another “Altseason,” EOS could see significant growth in 2024. Current projections suggest EOS might reach $1.165 by the end of the year, driven by increased developer adoption and market momentum. However, the token’s performance hinges on key factors such as adoption rates, competition from other blockchain platforms, and regulatory developments. Despite these uncertainties, EOS remains a promising contender for investors seeking exposure to altcoins in 2024. Qubetics Presale Is Exploding: The Top Crypto Presale to Buy Now Currently, in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics is offering early investors a chance to secure $TICS tokens at a low rate of $0.031. Each week, the token price rises by 10%, culminating in a 20% hike during the final phase. With over $5.9 million raised, 318 million tokens sold, and 9,000+ holders, Qubetics is rapidly gaining momentum. The numbers are compelling. Analysts predict $TICS could hit $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch. For investors entering now, the potential ROI is staggering. A $10 target would mean a return of over 32,028%, while $15 could yield an ROI of approximately 48,092%. With the presale ending soon, this phase presents a golden opportunity to maximise gains. Qubetics has already demonstrated its appeal through its cutting-edge technology and growing community. The excitement surrounding the presale only strengthens its position as the top crypto presale to buy for 2024 . Will you seize this chance before the next phase kicks in? Conclusion: Why Qubetics Leads the Pack The cryptocurrency market offers countless opportunities, but few are as compelling as Qubetics. While Filecoin continues to innovate in decentralised storage and EOS positions itself for growth in the coming year, Qubetics stands out with its ambitious plans and exceptional ROI potential. Its decentralised VPN service and rapidly advancing presale make it the Top Crypto Presale to buy, offering a rare blend of technology and opportunity. As analysts predict meteoric growth for $TICS, the time to act is now. Don’t miss your chance to join the Qubetics revolution and secure your place in what could be the next major success story in the blockchain world.

The 2024 report includes data from StablePulse.org, NFTpulse.org and CodeSlaw.app. Electric Capital’s report confirmed perceptions about the significant growth the crypto industry has witnessed across multiple sectors and on a global scale this year. The continued adoption and adaptation of the industry has had a great impact on the world and shown the industry’s capacity to innovate. One of these notable trends in this year’s report is the Asian developer momentum. The population of programmers from that part of the world has increased, taking over North America’s dominance. Asia now ranks first, while North America is third in line after Europe. Back in 2015, 81% of crypto developers were in North America and Europe. Now, that stat has dropped to 55%. India and Ethereum were the biggest winners this year Despite Asia taking the lead over other continents, the US remains the country with the highest concentration of developers, with 19%. However, the country is down from 38% in 2015. India, on the other hand, has seen the most growth and is now the country with the second-highest developer share. The South Asian nation has come a long way from its 10th position in 2015. The country also onboarded the most new crypto developers in 2024, contributing 17% of new talent.

Base owns 97% of NFT minting volume, while Solana owns 64% of NFT mint transactions. NFT minting volume reached an all-time high of $1.5B this year. Minting wallets grew to 67M in 2024, with most of the activity on Solana (57%), Polygon (24%), and Base (13%). The all-time high volume for unique minting wallets was 23M.

Restaking emerged in 2023 and grew to $30.6B this year. It has now become the largest sector in DeFi. EigenLayer spearheaded the growth in restaking as it saw its developer count grow more than twofold in 2024. 53% of EigenLayer developers are established and 39% of them are committed devs. Electric Capital’s report also shows stablecoins closing the year at an all-time high of $196B in circulation and $81B in daily transaction volume. Tether’s USDT is the runaway leader in stablecoin dominance, accounting for 72% of fiat-pegged tokens in circulation this year. Circle USDC’s 20% is its closest competition. Ethereum and TRON hosted the most issued stablecoins, with 59% and 35%, respectively.

37608711,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319441,1734130839,Ethereum Price Set to Pump to $5K Before Year’s End? Here’s Why a “Santa Rally” Is Likely,"As the Ethereum (ETH) price consolidates just above $3,900, traders are eyeing the possibility of a surge into the year’s end, a phenomenon referred to as a “Santa Rally”. From a technical perspective, Ethereum is looking good right now, sitting above all of its major moving averages and still in a clear uptrend. However, resistance in the form of the early 2024 highs just above $4,000 continues to cap the Ethereum price action. However, Christmas could be about to come early for Ethereum investors. While Polymarket betting odds only currently place a 14% chance that the Ethereum price will hit new all-time highs at $5,000, this may represent the market under-pricing the likelihood of a strong breakout. Here’s why. Ethereum Price to Pump to $5,000 Soon? Here’s Why That’s Likely Reason 1 – Vibes To say that vibes are good in the crypto market right now would be an understatement ahead of the arrival of an almost unimaginably pro-crypto incoming US administration in March. Trump promised this week to do great things for the crypto industry, his picks for Treasury Secretary and SEC Chair are ardently pro-crypto, and his family were spotted loading up their ETH, AAVE and LINK positions just days ago. U.S. President Donald Trump's World Liberty Financial bought • 2,631 $ETH ($10M) • 3,357 $AAVE ($1M) • 41,335 $LINK ($1M) UNREAL pic.twitter.com/KubybniuBb — Quinten | 048.eth (@QuintenFrancois) December 12, 2024 Its not hyperbole to say we are not he cusp of a new golden age for crypto markets as policy in the US swings decisively in a positive direction. That is a strong reason why buy pressure is likely to remain elevated into the year’s end, boding well for the Ethereum price. Reason 2 – Market Leadership and ETF Inflows The prospect of the establishment of a national Bitcoin reserve in the USA suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) will be a massive winner amid the upcoming administration. However, altcoins like Ethereum which have been weighed so heavily by regulatory uncertainty in recent years may enjoy an even greater snapback. And Ethereum is in a great position to be one of the strongest-performing altcoins . It remains far and away the most dominant blockchain in DeFi, with a 56% market share of TVL per DeFi Llama , even if Solana has overtaken it in terms of speculative trading activities (thanks to its lower fees). For investors new to crypto looking to expand beyond BTC, Ethereum will likely stand out as the obvious next option. That is even more the case given Ethereum is the only other major crypto to have spot ETFs in the US. According to data presented by The Block , Ethereum ETF inflows have been ramping up since Trump’s election victory. And there is no reason for this to slow down into the year’s end, meaning upside risks to the Ethereum price in the coming weeks. Reason 3 – On-chain Activity Heating Up Another reason to be bullish on the Ethereum price into the year’s end is because the activity on its blockchain is really starting to heat up. Per Glassnode’s Ethereum core on-chain dashboard , metrics such as number of active addresses, number of transactions, and total transfer volume are all trending higher and challenging yearly highs. That strengthens the adoption narrative and can help to support prices. But it also contributes to the narrative of Ethereum as a deflationary asset – a portion of the ETH gas fees get burnt, so the more fees are generated, the more ETH is burnt. How Much Higher Can Ethereum Go? With Ethereum now close to its record highs, investors would be forgiven for fearing that the best part of the rally might now be over. But that would be a mistake – Just like Bitcoin, the Ethereum price has historically moved in cycles, breaking into phases of aggressive price discovery, followed by large and prolonged drawdowns. Luckily for the bulls, a new phase of price discovery is likely just around the corner. Bitcoin entered its new phase of price discovery last month, as it historically always have within eight months of the BTC halving. Ethereum, meanwhile, has historically lagged Bitcoin by up to two months. That could mean an aggressive breakout to fresh record levels is coming in January. Various on-chain metrics also support the thesis that the top isn’t yet in – Ethereum’s “realized cap” (i.e. the market cap at the average price when each last coin moved) just hit new record highs at just under $248 billion. And the ratio of the ETH market cap to its realized cap, last around 1.5 per Glassnode , remains well below levels that have marked prior market peaks (above 3). Meanwhile, while high, the profitability of the Ethereum market also remains below levels that have marked prior Ethereum price peaks. Per Glassnode , NUPL was last just over 0.5, but prior market peaks have seen NUPL rise above 0.75. Regarding the question “how much higher can Ethereum go?”, no one knows for sure. But the answer is certainly a lot. The past cycle saw the Ethereum price rally over 4x beyond its prior record highs. A repeat of these gains is very possible, setting up the possibility of a near $20,000 Ethereum price. The post Ethereum Price Set to Pump to $5K Before Year’s End?

37605029,https://crypto.news/?p=14319389,1734130618,5 XRP alternatives to move from $300 to $6000 by early 2025,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP slows down but 5 altcoins, including Rexas Finance (RXS), could turn $300 into $6,000 by 2025. Table of Contents Rexas Finance Tron Floki Inu Dogecoin Polygon Conclusion Since November, XRP has been one of the strongest bull run performers, rising from $0.63 to $2.92. XRP’s momentum reversed when it failed to test $3, dropping to $2.52 levels. While XRP’s ascent has hit a snag, Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon might bring huge gains, potentially upgrading $300 portfolios to $6000l. Rexas Finance Investors looking to build a profitable portfolio from a low budget within the shortest time interval could consider Rexas Finance , one of the most inventive crypto projects. It seeks to digitise a variety of tangible things such as properties, commodities, and arts, thus enabling the retail investor to enter into otherwise untouchable investments. Considering the worldwide commodities, real estate, and financial assets market to be $121.2 trillion, $379.7 trillion, and $486 trillion, respectively, RWA tokenization is the future of money. Rexas Finance will open up investment options to a wider audience by allowing fractional ownership and digital trade of these precious assets, removing geographical and financial limitations. Rexas Finance’s ecosystem will include the Rexas Token Builder and QuickMint Bot, making asset-backed token creation, management, and trading easy. The platform will also support Rexas Treasury, a multi-chain yield optimizer that maximizes investor income with minimal effort. Moreover, it will offer a decentralized Launchpad for startups to raise funds and increase their reach. These features make Rexas Finance a key player in the DeFi movement. Rexas Finance’s presale has been a success so far, with the token price rising over 316% in three months. The project has raised $25.3 million and sold 334 million RXS tokens as investors flock to its current presale stage despite the price appreciation of $0.125. Rexas Finance opted for public presales over VC funding, a crucial step to creating a community-driven platform with decentralized ownership. A recent Certik audit improved Rexas Finance’s security and transparency. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, two major cryptocurrency tracking websites, have listed RXS, enhancing visibility and investor interest. Before RXS is listed on the proposed top crypto exchanges, investors have a limited time to buy it at its current presale price. Rexas Finance is also offering a $1 million giveaway, with the top 20 entrants each receiving $50,000 in RXS tokens. Experts see a huge potential in the Rexas Finance project, with many projecting a massive surge to $10 immediately after its anticipated mega listings.

This prediction follows its impressive chart patterns, which suggest bullish momentum. Dogecoin Dogecoin recently reached a yearly top of $0.4634, proving its market viability. A strong optimistic trend over the last month produced a 200% increase. Though its popularity and strong community support have kept it among the top cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin is most renowned for its meme roots. After rising, DOGE still lags 37% below its all-time high of $0.73. Due to considerable accumulation by whales, recently launched DOGE ETP, and upcoming political shift in the US, Dogecoin might soon soar above $1. Polygon Polygon is recognized as an Ethereum Layer-2 scalability solution. The POL coin, which rose 18% to $0.64 in the previous week, is becoming a key player in Ethereum dApp scalability. Polygon’s long-term projections are good despite recent setbacks. The platform makes perfect use of Ethereum’s features, making it a necessary component of the Ethereum ecology. As the altcoin season nears, Polygon’s price will rise as Ethereum benefits from the anticipated clear regulatory climate following Gary Gensler’s recent resignation. Experts predict it might surge to $5 in the coming months. Conclusion Rexas Finance, Tron, Floki Inu, Dogecoin, and Polygon are predicted to rise dramatically in 2025. These solutions provide distinct promise and development potential for those looking to grow their portfolios from $300 to $6,000 by early 2025. Rexas Finance is a transformative project with a solid foundation. Its presale success, growing ecosystem, and upcoming exchange listings make it a great candidate for huge gains.

37625173,https://crypto.news/?p=14317728,1734130020,"Why shareholders want Amazon to bet on Bitcoin, and why it matters","What if Amazon added Bitcoin to its balance sheet? With BTC up 125% this year, some shareholders argue it’s the perfect moment to explore the crypto market. Table of Contents Amazon under pressure to add Bitcoin to reserves Microsoft facing its own Bitcoin dilemma MicroStrategy’s shift to Bitcoin Bitcoin could change corporate treasury practices Crypto’s growing role and the road ahead Amazon under pressure to add Bitcoin to reserves Amazon, one of the largest and most influential companies in the world, is facing increasing pressure from its shareholders to diversify its financial reserves by adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) to the mix. Shareholders have pushed for Amazon to at least consider holding a small percentage of its reserves in Bitcoin — just 5%, according to one proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research. This suggestion stems from a growing trend seen in other major corporations, such as MicroStrategy , Tesla, and Block, all of which have embraced Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and a way to potentially enhance long-term shareholder value. Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, often subject to dramatic swings in price. However, proponents argue that, much like Amazon’s own stock, Bitcoin’s volatility should not overshadow its potential to outperform traditional assets like bonds. As of Dec. 9, Bitcoin has already proven to be a strong performer, having surged by 125% this year alone, far surpassing the performance of traditional investment vehicles, including gold and the S&P 500. In comparison, MicroStrategy, which has heavily invested in Bitcoin, has seen its stock price nearly 450%, outperforming Amazon’s own 51% gain over the same period. Shareholders argue that with $585 billion in total assets — $88 billion of which is held in cash and low-yielding investments like bonds—Amazon should reconsider its investment strategy. Microsoft facing its own Bitcoin dilemma Not just Amazon — Microsoft is also facing a similar crossroads when it comes to Bitcoin. As the BTC continues its impressive surge, recently topping $100,000, Microsoft shareholders have urged the company to follow in the footsteps of firms like MicroStrategy by adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The proposal, titled “Assessment of Investing in Bitcoin,” will be up for a vote on Dec. 10. It’s backed by the same group, the NCPPR. Yet, Microsoft’s board has advised against the proposal. Co-founder Bill Gates, who has been vocal about his scepticism of crypto assets, has warned that the current crypto market is driven by what he calls the “greater fool theory” — essentially, a speculative bubble. Gates’ approach is reflected in the board’s stance, with many members believing Microsoft is already making thoughtful investment decisions without venturing into such volatile territory. In fact, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman, Michael Saylor, has directly lobbied Microsoft’s board to consider Bitcoin, arguing that it’s a crucial digital transformation and one of the highest-performing assets corporations can hold. This upcoming vote at Microsoft could set an important precedent. If the proposal passes, it would signal that mainstream companies are beginning to seriously consider Bitcoin as a legitimate and valuable part of their financial strategy. MicroStrategy’s shift to Bitcoin MicroStrategy, once known primarily as a software and business intelligence company, has undergone a radical transformation in recent years. Historically, the company focused on providing enterprise analytics solutions, helping organizations make data-driven decisions. But in 2020, MicroStrategy took a bold and unconventional turn — it began shifting large portions of its capital into Bitcoin, a move that has since redefined its identity. The pivot was driven by concerns over the depreciating value of cash in a low-interest, inflationary environment. MicroStrategy’s leadership, led by then-CEO Michael Saylor, argued that Bitcoin, as a deflationary asset with a capped supply, offered a far better store of value. The firm began buying Bitcoin aggressively , describing it as “digital gold” and a cornerstone of its corporate treasury strategy. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin buying spree accelerated rapidly. While it took nearly a year to accumulate its first 100,000 bitcoins, the pace picked up significantly in subsequent years. As of Dec. 9, MicroStrategy holds a staggering 423,650 bitcoins, purchased at an average cost of $60,324 per coin, with a total investment of $25.6 billion, making it one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin, surpassing even Nvidia Corp.’s cash reserves and most non-financial S&P 500 companies. The impact on MicroStrategy’s stock has been dramatic. Over the past five years, MSTR’s share price has surged nearly 2,500%, trading at $377 as of Dec. 9. Earlier in November, it hit a 52-week high of $543 before experiencing a retracement. While Bitcoin’s price increases have boosted the company’s valuation, the volatility of the asset means that MicroStrategy’s fortunes are now closely tied to the ups and downs of the crypto market. Bitcoin could change corporate treasury practices If companies like Amazon and Microsoft integrate Bitcoin into their reserves, it could redefine corporate treasury practices on a global scale. Traditionally, businesses diversify their financial holdings across cash, bonds, equities, and other low-risk instruments to manage risk and ensure liquidity during economic shifts. Including Bitcoin — a digital asset with a finite supply — might seem unconventional, but it aligns with the growing trend of seeking inflation-resistant and high-performing alternatives. The approval of the first spot Bitcoin ETF in January was a key milestone for institutional adoption. It legitimized Bitcoin as a regulated investment vehicle and sparked a wave of interest from both corporates and individual investors. As of Dec. 9, combined spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold over $115 billion in assets under management (AUM), making them some of the fastest-growing ETFs in financial history. What’s even more remarkable is the consistent demand: since November 29, spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded only net positive inflows, pulling in over $3 billion in just a matter of days. For companies like Amazon and Microsoft, adding Bitcoin to their reserves could enhance their financial strategies in multiple ways. Even a small allocation — say 5% of their reserves — could offer huge upside potential, especially as Bitcoin’s long-term performance continues to outpace traditional assets like gold and bonds. Furthermore, holding Bitcoin would align these corporations with the rapidly growing ecosystem of institutional adoption, a trend highlighted by the explosive growth of ETFs and the entry of major players like BlackRock into the Bitcoin market. The ripple effects of such a decision would be profound. If the world’s most influential companies take this step, it could normalize Bitcoin as a treasury asset across industries, encouraging smaller companies to follow suit, potentially driving Bitcoin’s price higher due to increased demand. Crypto’s growing role and the road ahead In the last few years, the crypto world has changed dramatically, and a lot of this shift can be traced back to how major figures, companies, and governments have started to get involved. A key example is the recent appointment of David Sacks as the AI and Crypto Czar by President-elect Donald Trump , hinting how both AI and blockchain are now seen as critical areas for innovation, and it shows how much more seriously the U.S. government is taking these technologies. The vast adoption of crypto, in particular, is similar to how other tech innovations, like the internet or cloud computing, went from niche to mainstream. In the 90s, companies were hesitant about the internet, but now it’s an essential part of doing business. The same is starting to happen with crypto. As more companies, from tech giants to financial firms, look for ways to gain exposure to crypto, it’s clear that we’re entering a new phase. The next few years will likely see these shifts become even more normalized, and in the process, crypto could become as ubiquitous as any other asset class in corporate treasuries and investment strategies.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/why-shareholders-want-amazon-to-bet-on-bitcoin/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37625173.jpeg
37604186,https://crypto.news/?p=14319387,1734129129,Lightchain AI is geared to disrupt Solana’s dominance; experts discuss the possibilities,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana faces competition as Lightchain AI, with AI-powered blockchain tech, offers a bold vision for decentralized creativity. Table of Contents Solana’s current position in the blockchain space What makes Lightchain AI a contender? Comparing Lightchain AI and Solana: Key Metrics Why experts see disruption potential The road ahead: Challenges and opportunities In the world of blockchain technology, Solana (SOL) has carved out a significant niche for itself. Known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds, low costs, and growing ecosystem, Solana has become a go-to blockchain for developers and investors. However, as technology evolves and new players emerge, questions arise about whether Solana’s dominance can be challenged. Enter Lightchain AI , a next-generation blockchain platform that combines unique artificial intelligence (AI) integration with creative scalability solutions. Boasting its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI presents a bold vision of the future—one where blockchain and AI work in tandem to power decentralized creativity. Can Lightchain AI challenge Solana’s supremacy? Experts believe the possibility is real, and here’s why. You might also like: Shiba Inu highlights and Lightchain AI’s blockchain solutions for December 2024 Solana’s current position in the blockchain space Solana’s rapid rise to prominence in the blockchain world can be attributed to several key factors: Speed and Scalability: Solana processes up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), a significant leap over Ethereum’s 15 TPS and other competing blockchains. Low Fees: Solana’s transaction fees are fractions of a penny, making it attractive for developers and users looking for cost-effective solutions. Developer Ecosystem: Solana’s active community has built an array of decentralized applications (dApps) spanning DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Institutional Interest: High-profile backers like FTX and venture capital firms have provided financial and strategic support. Despite these strengths, Solana has faced its fair share of challenges: Network Downtime: Solana’s network has experienced multiple outages, raising concerns about its reliability and centralization.

The analyst urges the XRP community to monitor this fractal closely, highlighting the need to monitor price movements in the coming weeks. XRP Price Eyes $16 As Analyst Spots Bullish Fractal An XRP supporter on X (formerly Twitter), known as ‘LUDXRP,’ has released a detailed chart analysis, predicting that the XRP price could climb to an ambitious price target of $16.15. The analyst mentioned the presence of a historic fractal on the XRP chart. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything The fractal pattern, indicated by the blue circle in the chart, highlights a significant upward movement in the XRP price. Following the movements of the chart, if XRP can replicate this fractal, it could trigger a significant price rally toward $16.15. Multiple green horizontal lines have also been shown in the chart, spotlighting different resistance and support zones that could trigger a reaction in the XRP price. With XRP trading at $2.42, the horizontal trend lines above its current price are seen as crucial resistance levels. The analyst highlighted intermediate price levels like $2.8, $4.1, $7.6, and $12.7 as crucial resistance levels, which XRP must surpass before reaching the ambitious target of $16.15. Additionally, the chart identifies $2 as a potential support level, warning that if the price drops below this mark, it could lead to a possible price dip to $1. With the possibility of breaking above $16, the XRP supporter has urged community members to monitor the fractal on the price chart closely. He emphasized the importance of XRP maintaining an upward trend within the blue circle, which could trigger his projected price increase toward $16. XRP To See “Face Melting” Rally This Christmas A crypto analyst identified as the ‘Charting Guy’ on X has expressed optimism about XRP’s future price outlook. According to the analyst, XRP could experience a ” face-melting “ rally to new highs by Christmas and in late January. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Price Rebounds Toward $0.00003, Taking 69% Of All Holders Back Into The Green The analyst has stated that if XRP continues to follow past bullish trends seen in 2017, the market will likely consolidate for another two weeks until Christmas. He disclosed that this bullish projection was primarily based on XRP’s fractal rather than relying on Fibonacci levels. In response to a comment from a crypto community member, the Charting guy agreed that by December 30, XRP would experience a series of strong green weeks, potentially driven either by the Christmas hype or the bullish sentiment surrounding the RLUSD stablecoin. The analyst also agreed that January 20, the inauguration day of Donald Trump as the United States (US) President, could mark the XRP price top, which the market would likely consider a “sell the news event.” Featured image created with Dall.E, chart from Tradingview.com",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-breakout-above-10/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

This comes after leading the panel’s subcommittee on digital assets. This committee is pivotal in crafting the nation’s crypto regulations, and Hill’s election marks a turning point for the industry. Hill has been a vocal critic of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly its chairman, Gary Gensler. Hill believes Gensler’s heavy enforcement approach to crypto regulation stifles innovation. In September, U.S. Congressman Tom Emmer criticized Gensler’s SEC leadership, calling his tenure the most destructive and lawless. Hill argues that the U.S. needs a clearer market structure for digital assets, limiting the potential of Web3 and blockchain technologies. Many crypto leaders share this view, calling for necessary changes. The crypto community has praised Hill’s leadership, with groups like the DeFi Education Fund and Blockchain Association supporting his efforts to create clear regulations. They appreciate his focus on innovation and protecting the rights of developers and DeFi users. Hill is seen as a strong advocate for sensible crypto policies. Digital Assets: A Priority in the First 100 Days Hill’s vision for 2025 aligns closely with Steve Scalise, the House Majority Leader. Scalise plans to move a regulatory structure bill for digital assets within the first 100 days of President-elect Donald Trump’s term. The focus will include stablecoins and other key aspects of the crypto landscape, creating much-needed certainty for the industry. Scalise intends to establish a framework that will allow digital assets to grow with clear rules in place. The new bill will provide businesses and innovators with the confidence to build. A Potential Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In addition to regulatory work, discussions around a strategic Bitcoin reserve have gained momentum, both federally and at the state level. Hill will be tasked with navigating these discussions in his new role, including proposals from Senator Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Giovanni Capriglione. Lummis has proposed a bill directing the U.S. Treasury to purchase one million Bitcoins over five years. Capriglione has filed a state bill to create a Bitcoin reserve through donations, holding the assets for up to five years. When asked about the idea of a Bitcoin reserve, Hill acknowledged its appeal but was cautious in his assessment.

In December 2024, it’s not just about the next viral meme—it’s about serious growth, explosive potential, and making those significant returns. If you’re looking to ride the hype and secure your spot in the future of meme coins, then you need to pay attention to the best meme coins for significant returns. From BTFD Coin raking in millions in presale sales to Goatseus Maximus battling a slight dip, and Degen steadily moving up—there are some coins you’ll want to keep on your radar. Let’s start with BTFD Coin —rapidly becoming a powerhouse in the meme coin world. The presale has already raised over $3.7 million, with 53 billion tokens sold and counting. The community is buzzing, and the BTFD Coin presale is already showing signs of massive returns. If you’re looking to snag a piece of this before it rockets even further, you better act fast. BTFD Coin: From Presale Success to 2025 Moonshot We can’t talk about the best meme coins for significant returns without giving BTFD Coin a serious spotlight. From the “Buy The Dip” mentality to staking rewards that could offer you an APY of 90%, there’s no shortage of reasons why this coin is making waves. The presale for BTFD Coin is already in full swing, with over $3.7 million raised and 53 billion tokens sold. That’s a lot of momentum to start with. With the presale price at $0.00013, this coin is set to see substantial growth as the price increases over time. The community is massive, and with Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull leading the charge, BTFD Coin is taking off faster than we can keep up. But let’s talk numbers: if you were to invest $2,000 at the current presale price of $0.00013 per token, you’d be buying 15.3 million BTFD coins. Now, if the price were to reach $0.0006 by 2025 (a reasonable prediction based on current momentum), your $2,000 investment could turn into $9,180. That’s a 359% return on your investment—now, that’s the kind of growth you want in your portfolio. BTFD Coin has everything you could want for significant returns—staking rewards, a Play-to-Earn game , and a community-focused movement that will push it into the crypto stratosphere. Goatseus Maximus: Facing the Dip, But Long-Term Potential Remains Next up is Goatseus Maximus, a meme coin that had all the hype earlier this year but has recently faced some volatility. The coin has seen a 24-hour -0.95% decline, but don’t be fooled by this temporary setback—it’s still one of the best meme coins for significant returns over the long term. At its peak, Goatseus Maximus was hitting highs, with prices that reflected its strong community and meme-driven popularity. But right now, it’s undergoing a bit of a retrace. The latest price sits around $0.7382, and despite the short-term dip, Goatseus Maximus still boasts a robust ecosystem with massive community engagement and ongoing development. This dip could present a perfect buying opportunity if you’re a believer in meme coins with long-term growth potential. As for predictions, Goatseus Maximus could very well rebound in 2025, potentially reaching prices around $0.73558 to $1.466409. For investors looking to buy and hold for significant returns, Goatseus Maximus is still one to consider, despite its current downtrend. Degen: A Steady Climb for the Bold Investor And then there’s Degen, the meme coin that refuses to quit. While Goatseus Maximus might be experiencing a brief hiccup, and BTFD Coin is on its way to the moon, Degen has been moving steadily upward, gaining traction among investors who believe in its quiet, consistent growth. Degen might not have the same viral hype as the others, but it’s proving to be one of the best meme coins for significant returns due to its consistent growth trajectory and strong community backing. The current price of Degen is sitting at $0.015359, but its solid fundamentals—paired with increasing interest from influencers and crypto communities—means it could experience strong growth moving into 2025. Looking ahead to 2025, Degen has the potential to hit between $0.027856 and $0.077508.It’s the steady Eddie of the group, but don’t sleep on its potential. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the BTFD Coin Presale—The Time to Act is Now! If you’re serious about grabbing the best meme coins for significant returns, BTFD Coin is the one that’s impossible to ignore. Whether you’re looking at short-term gains or long-term growth, BTFD Coin has the community, the rewards, and the Play-to-Earn integration to make it a serious contender. So, why wait? Invest in BTFD Coin today and take advantage of the presale price before it skyrockets. At the current price, the potential for growth is massive.

37604877,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319436,1734128084,"VanEck Predicts $180K Bitcoin, US Strategic Reserve, and Bank Custody by 2025","Asset management firm VanEck forecasts a massive bull run for cryptocurrencies. It predicts Bitcoin will reach as high as $180K, and other major digital assets will reach record highs by the end of 2025. The firm projected in a December 13 blog post that the cryptocurrency bull market will experience a “medium-term peak” in the first quarter of 2025 before a period of consolidation and eventual recovery leads to new all-time highs. VanEck Predicts Bitcoin at $180K and Ethereum Above $6K in the Next Market Cycle According to a blog post published on December 13 by Matthew Sigel, VanEck’s head of digital asset research, at the anticipated market peak, VanEck expects Bitcoin (BTC) to reach approximately $180,000, with Ethereum (ETH) surpassing $6,000. Other major cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL) and Sui (SUI), could see valuations exceeding $500 and $10, respectively. However, the firm forecasts a summer correction, with Bitcoin facing a 30% retracement and altcoins potentially declining by up to 60%. Despite these setbacks, VanEck expects a recovery by the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and achieving new highs before the end of the year. NEW: Spot #Bitcoin ETF issuer VanEck is predicting in 2025: – $180,000 bitcoin price – Banks will be allowed to custody bitcoin – US will adopt Strategic Bitcoin Reserve – Bitcoin ETFs will support in-kind creations & redemptions THIS WOULD BE MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/l6JyjFaaRc — Nikolaus Hoffman (@NikolausHoff) December 13, 2024 The firm has identified several key indicators to monitor for signs of speculative market peaks. For example, high funding rates on Bitcoin perpetual futures above 10% for three months could indicate speculative excess. Similarly, many Bitcoin holders with unrealized profits exceeding a 70% profit-to-cost ratio suggest market euphoria. An overvalued market cap relative to realized value, measured by MVRV scores above 5, often signals overheated conditions. Additionally, a decline in Bitcoin’s dominance below 40% could indicate late-cycle speculative shifts into riskier altcoins. Increased speculation from non-crypto-savvy individuals is also a warning sign of mania near a market top. The blog post also reflects on previous predictions made by Sigel, including a projection that Bitcoin could climb to $2.9 million per coin by 2050 and Ethereum reach $22,000 per token by 2030 . Trump’s Pro-Crypto Administration: A Boost for Bitcoin Institutional Adoption? The market outlook for Bitcoin reflects growing bullish sentiment among experts. Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, has predicted BTC will surpass $1 million by 2030 , citing increased participation from major investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. Similarly, Henry Arslanian, co-founder of Nine Blocks Capital Management, believes President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-crypto administration will drive institutional adoption. In a November 6 X post , he highlighted opportunities for asset managers and family offices to enter the U.S. crypto market. What is the impact of Trump’s win on the #Bitcoin and #Cryptocurrency markets? 3 things to watch: – change of US regulatory stance – further entry of institutional investors – wave of M&A in the space pic.twitter.com/9rJAJNO6h9 — Henri Arslanian (@HenriArslanian) November 6, 2024 Analysts are optimistic about Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Crypto research firm 10x Research suggests BTC could reach $100,000 by January 2025 , noting historical patterns where a six-month high typically leads to a 40% median gain over three months. Independent analyst Mags also predicts Bitcoin could hit $250,000 within a year , referencing its 360% post-election rally in 2020 and potential similar growth in 2024. MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin strategy continues to yield massive returns. Since 2020, the firm has invested $23.5 billion to amass over 400,000 BTC, equivalent to 2% of Bitcoin’s total supply.

Table of Contents Wall Street bulls flock to WallitIQ XRP faces pressure as Wall Street bulls predict 60% crash Conclusion The XRP price is shaky, as its past highs could soon halt, with Wall Street bulls dumping and predicting a massive 60% crash. As confidence in the XRP price falters, the Wall Street bulls are pivoting toward WallitIQ , eager to buy this new presale token and dominate the crypto market with ROIs of up to 46,000%. Wall Street bulls flock to WallitIQ The Wall Street experts are buying WallitIQ , a presale token set to transform the crypto market with a forecasted 46,000% gain in 14 days. Priced at $0.0243, WallitIQ has already raised over $2.4 million, with tokens selling out rapidly as investors race to secure their positions. Wall Street bulls believe WallitIQ is the ultimate alternative to XRP, as its presale has performed exceptionally well. The WallitIQ presale is quickly approaching a sellout, providing a narrow window to buy tokens before the price rises to $0.0420 in the next stage. With a SolidProof audit guaranteeing security and advanced wallet features like biometric authentication and fraud detection, Wall Street bulls recognize WallitIQ as a safer and smarter investment. WallitIQ could deliver over 400% gains upon launch and listing on major exchanges for those seeking long-term returns. The WallitIQ wallet will also support trading of over 1,000 cryptocurrencies and will feature QR and Scan payment options.

Currently trading at $2.01, the XRP price is struggling to hold its key support level despite a 232% surge on the monthly chart. Data also reveals a concerning drop, with the XRP price declining over 21% on the weekly chart and its market cap shrinking by 17%, now at $114 billion. On the daily chart, the XRP price has fallen further, recording a 16.5% dip at the time of writing. This downward trend is attributed to Wall Street bulls selling off their XRP holdings, causing concerns of an imminent crash and a shift in attention toward alternative investments. As decreased market activity and fading momentum hinder the XRP price’s ability to reach new highs, investors are pivoting toward WallitIQ. With fears of a 60% crash looming, XRP holders are left questioning whether it’s time to follow the Wall Street bulls and consider WallitIQ. Conclusion Wall Street bulls are predicting a 60% crash for the XRP price while dumping the token and turning their focus to WallitIQ. Their bold projections of a possible 46,000% surge in just 14 days have ignited a wave of excitement and FOMO, driving investors toward the WallitIQ presale. WallitIQ, priced at a discounted $0.0243, has gained a listing on CoinMarketCap and plans to turn modest investments into life-changing profits.

Table of Contents XRP: changing Digital Payments Cardano: Blockchain for the future Dogecoin: From meme coin to major altcoin Rexas Finance: Tokenizing the Future of Assets Conclusion Investors are always searching for the next possible investment that can yield them considerable returns. For instance, anyone who is looking to take a $1000 investment and reap $100000 returns then has ways to do that because some of the cryptocurrencies have been able to beat the market. Out of them, XRP, Cardano(ADA), Dogecoin(DOGE), and Rexas Finance (RXS) stand out as the top performers and offer significant opportunities to increase their profits shortly. XRP: changing Digital Payments There is much to catch up with XRP , which is already known in crypto. Having been considered one of the leading digital currencies within the database of the Ripple Association, XRP’s main aspect was to increase the efficiency of payments around the globe. The digital asset, however, boosts its attractiveness through remarkable operating figures, including annual growth of 311.82%, despite being embroiled in the class action suit with the Securities and Exchanges Commission of the United States, among other litigation issues. The primary goal of XRP is to facilitate global transactions at the lowest costs possible, with payment confirmations done in seconds. Having collaborated with several finance companies, Ripple has established a robust presence in worldwide payment services. Currently priced at $131.51 billion, XRP has started catching the eyes of institutional investors. Considering the recent strengthening of the DeFi industry, XRP is well-positioned to take advantage of its growth in the future and provide ample returns to investors. You might also like: DTX Exchange set to make history with ICO as Dogecoin whales adopt $9.5M pre-launch Cardano: Blockchain for the future Within the last year, Cardano (ADA) has made huge gains of over 200% which only goes to prove that Cardano is a top tier blockchain project. Cardano has 203.78% annual growth and its market is around $43 billion. It has a very active ecosystem which is growing rapidly. The active developers are working on strengthening its smart contract and decentralized applications platform which ensures the growth potential is quite high. Cardano stands a good chance of remaining relevant in the crypto space as its user and developer base increases which also means that its holding more prospects for innovations and adoption in blockchain technology. Dogecoin: From meme coin to major altcoin As the past year has shown, Dogecoin has, so it’s no longer a laughing stock. Having started just as a meme featuring a Shiba Inu, it did catch the attention of those in its space, and today, it has an ever-growing community thanks in large part to Elon Musk. What’s fascinating is the spike in the price of Dogecoin, which has gone up by 121.31% alongside its market cap which currently stands at $62.76 Billion, marking its growth as enormous. If more people begin to see Dogecoin as a proper means of transacting, not only will its price increase, but all those who bought it earlier will benefit greatly as a result. Rexas Finance: Tokenizing the Future of Assets One of the new and fascinating projects is Rexas Finance (RXS), which appears to be gaining traction. Soon after its launch, the project experienced rapid growth, with the presale that raised $24.6 million through nearly the selling of over 321 million tokens coming to an end. The price of a token during this phase was $0.125. The presale is currently priced at stage nine, and after it is finished, Rexas Finance will list on major exchanges, which will probably make the value of this coin even higher.Rexas Finance’s goal is to make tokenization of real-world assets a reality so that anyone can create and trade digital tokens backed by real-world assets such as real estate, art, and commodities. By implementing fractional ownership, Rexas Finance makes it possible for ordinary investors to access valuable market segments that were formerly accessible only to the rich class. As blockchain continues to be adopted in the financial world, Rexas Finance could change the $379 trillion real estate industry and beyond. The project has already gained tangible traction, and with its upcoming tier-1 exchange listing, the price of RXS will be expected to drop dramatically. Besides, Rexas Finance has been attracting considerable community participation with its $1 million giveaway promotion, where 20 lucky draws will award $50,000 in RXS tokens, which drives up interest and excitement even more than before. For early adopters, Rexas Finance presents an interesting opportunity as one gets to enter at the ground level, and given the potential of the platform and the demand for the token, one could stand to make huge returns. For investors looking to balance their portfolio with a project that offers a lot more upside in the asset tokenization market, a $1,000 investment into RXS can yield considerable returns, primarily if the platform reaches its ambition of fundamentally changing the ownership of real-world assets. Conclusion If anyone out there wants to turn $1,000 into a whopping $100,000, then they should consider investing in XRP, Cardano, ADA, Dogecoin, or Rexas Finance. These cryptocurrencies have massive potential, but Rexas Finance’s unique potential makes it the best option.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ripple’s XRP and DTX tokens are poised to soar, with whales investing big and DTX presale exceeding $10.10M despite market dips. Table of Contents Ripple rebounds: XRP whales invest $500m amid market crash Massive opportunity – Investors grab DTX Exchange Aat $0.12 Key takeaways Experts reveal that the bullish price actions of Ripple and DTX Exchange are not over yet, suggesting investors shift to the XRP and DTX tokens, as these coins are set to soar further. With Ripple’s stablecoin approval and DTX’s presale craze, both these platforms are set to touch new highs in no time! Ripple (XRP) is witnessing a pump in the XRP momentum as whales show confidence in the altcoin, investing hugely in the XRP token despite the market crash. Similarly, DTX’s presale mania knows no bounds as investors push the presale raise above $10.10 million. You might also like: Bluntz predicts breakout for SHIB as DTX and ETH ride bullish wave Ripple rebounds: XRP whales invest $500m amid market crash Aside from Ripple’s stablecoin approval, XRP’s rapid rebound also appears to have been supported by an unusual buying frenzy observed among whale investors. While the global crypto markets entered a tailspin on Monday in reaction to geopolitical risks, on-chain data trends show that whale investors capitalized on the falling prices to buy the dip, fueling market liquidity and nullifying bearish sentiment. The Santiment chart monitors real-time changes in balances of whale wallets holding at least 1 million XRP coins. The chart reveals that Ripple’s price has been on a buying spree since mid-November, when controversial SEC Chairman Gary Gensler confirmed his imminent exit. After a mild sell-off when the XRP price topped out at $2.91 on December 4, crypto whales have capitalized on the ensuing market volatility to buy large amounts of XRP coins. Since Dec 4, the whale cluster increased their balances from 4.58 billion XRP to 4.79 billion XRP at press time on Dec 11. Valued at current prices, this increase of 210 million XRP reflects that crypto whales invest another $494.2 million within the past week, capitalizing on the market volatility and bullish sentiment surrounding the RLUSD stablecoin approval in New York. When whale investors make a surge in large acquisitions amid a market dip, the resultant market liquidity boost allows panic sellers to exit without causing a major drag on prices. This partly explains why XRP price staged an early rebound above $2.40 on Tuesday while outpacing other top-ranked assets like BTC and ETH. Investors are rushing to grab the opportunity to make colossal gains before Ripple skyrockets beyond its current value; therefore, a vast majority of investors are seen rushing to the XRP token in the present bull run. Massive opportunity – Investors grab DTX Exchange Aat $0.12 DTX Exchange is emerging as the most capable player in the DeFi industry. With a unique trading infrastructure and a combination of blockchain and AI, DTX Exchange has attracted global traders to its presale. In the sixth stage of the presale, DTX Exchange has raised $10.10 million, with over 60% of tokens sold. With the first-ever hybrid technique, DTX Exchange is poised to flip ranking in the exchange space, giving tough competition to established names like Binance and Robinhood. DTX’s hybrid model brings the features of both CEX and DEX, which helps increase traders’ growth and scale the platform at the global level. The DTX trading platform allows traders to access over 120,000+ assets and features like 1,000x leverage, VulcanX blockchain, and KYC-free registration. For users’ security, the exchange provides a Phoenix wallet, which is named one of the most secure wallets with a cold storage feature. The DTX ecosystem has a community-centric approach that lets community members generate passive incomes through different models. As Wall Street analysts projected, the current undervalued price of $0.12 is highly beneficial for investors because it can rise to $10. Key takeaways The optimistic price actions of DTX Exchange and Ripple are not yet to continue, according to experts, who advise investors to switch to XRP and DTX tokens as these coins are expected to rise much higher. Both of these platforms are poised to reach new heights soon, thanks to DTX’s fervor for presales and Ripple’s stablecoin authorization! Investors show unshakable confidence in these platforms. Therefore, now could be the best time to invest in XRP and DTX before the price surges further! For more information, visit the DTX Exchange presale website and join the online community.

37602405,https://blockworks.co/news/solana-teams-analyze-debanking-narrative,1734125400,Solana teams pick up on debanking narrative,"This is a segment from the Lightspeed newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . When Marc Andreessen went on The Joe Rogan Experience and said 30 of a16z’s portfolio founders had been debanked, or had their bank accounts closed arbitrarily, a chorus of crypto figures joined in to cry foul on the US banking system. While discontent with the banking system is obviously nothing new in crypto, the debanking narrative — the extent of which we still know relatively little about — has given fresh ammunition to teams building bank replacements. On Solana, projects from onchain banks to subscription services are making their case for the debanked and unbanked to sign up. What’s unclear is whether today’s banking alternatives can succeed where past iterations have failed. After the Joe Rogan podcast went live, Squads Labs director of research Shimon Newman began working on a report on the contours of a federal conspiracy to debank crypto entrepreneurs and startups — known in crypto as Operation Chokepoint 2.0. An early version of the report shared with Lightspeed highlights how US regulators’ perceive that there is a lot of risk associated with crypto — a perception that extends to fintech and payment service providers. As a result, there has been a large number of debankings, though detailed data on the exact number of crypto-related debankings remains scarce. Newman’s report cites data saying an estimated 0.1% of laundered money is intercepted by current anti-money laundering efforts, and less than 1% of crypto volume is illicit. But whether or not the crypto crackdown is worthwhile, Squads is capitalizing on it: The startup’s smart wallet app has begun offering a “virtual US bank account” that can accept bank transfers and convert dollars into stablecoins for low fees. It does not offer credit-related services like taking out a loan, Newman said. Iron is also building an “onchain bank” on Solana, though its founder’s public messaging has focused on the benefits of stablecoins rather than the scourge of debanking in recent days. CFX Labs founder Nick Cavet shilled me today on his startup’s idea for “rebanking,” where USD deposits can be tokenized and essentially run on rails alongside the traditional banking system. Serj Korj, co-founder of Solana incremental subscription app DePlan, started another initiative called Subdoor that lets people pay for subscriptions in crypto. He has leaned into the debanking narrative as well, though he pointed out in text messages that there are far more people who are unbanked — or never had bank access to begin with — in the world. The narrative that banks are too opaque and free from accountability for wrongdoing has caught a second wind from debanking, but it’s not a new story. History suggests any crypto-ification of banking would require regulators to get on board too. And for some, the debanking narrative has already passed. “Debanking is a year old story. And fintech eye rolls cuz it’s a 10 year old story,” Cavet said in a text. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

37602231,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627248,1734125149,Bit Global Digital files complaint against Coinbase for delisting WBTC,"Bit Global Digital, the global controller and issuer of Wrapped BTC (WBTC) filed a complaint against Coinbase, Inc. The lawsuit seeks damages from the delisting of WBTC from the exchange. Bit Global Digital estimated damages of up to $1B after the delisting of Wrapped BTC (WBTC) from Coinbase. In a December 13 filing with the US District Court, Northern District of California, Bit Global pointed out the extensive potential direct and reputational losses from the lawsuit. Bit Global claimed Coinbase noticed the utility of WBTC, the most widely used form of wrapped Bitcoin. In 2024, Coinbase introduced its new asset, cbBTC, which already launched on Ethereum, Base, and Solana. Both WBTC and the new cbBTC traded on Coinbase, until on November 19 the exchange announced the upcoming delisting. The newly filed lawsuit noted the action curbed free competition and damaged the reputation of the longest-running wrapped token. The launch of cbBTC arrived in September, immediately spreading concern across all users, especially in DeFi lending. The lawsuit filing claims the launch of cbBTC and the subsequent delisting of WBTC could lead to reputational and market losses valued at up to $1B. The filing does not explicitly seek those damages, as the exact size of the claim will be determined during the trial. Coinbase makes a relatively small market for WBTC, carrying only 0.71% of the total spot volumes. WBTC is most active on Binance, as well as on its Uniswap V3 decentralized pair. Spot trading uses a relatively small share of the WBTC supply, at around 5.1% . Most WBTC is involved as collateral in lending. Around 20% of the token are used for interoperability and smart contracts. Over 32% of the supply is acquired for holding, in the form of an ERC-20 token. WBTC delisting follows controversy with the wrapped token’s controlling entity The shift to cbBTC also follows a controversy regarding control over WBTC. Formerly issued by BitGo, WBTC is now controlled by Bit Global and its subsidiary. The issue with the new arrangement is the potential for issuing WBTC on other networks, especially TRON. There were also concerns about Justin Sun’s control over the supply and collateral of WBTC. Currently, WBTC is one of the most transparent wrapped tokens, with a public list of addresses holding the collateral. There are concerns over issuing WBTC on TRON without a transparent collateral, or for exploits against the actual BTC collateral. Currently, TRON only carries around 99 WBTC , an early-stage test run. Coinbase’s wrapped token has already expanded to 21,605 cbBTC , with just 652 tokens on Solana and 4,229 tokens on Base. The asset still has to catch up with the supply of 135,843.65 WBTC. WBTC slightly decreased its supply since August, when control shifted to Bit Global Digital. | Source: Dune Analytics The issuer and controller controversy led to a predominance of WBTC burns over the past few months. The current supply of WBTC is the lowest since 2021, diminishing from over 152K tokens in the summer of 2024. At the current price of BTC above $101,000, the diminished supply may become one of the points in determining the damages for Bit Global Digital. In addition to Coinbase phasing out WBTC, the asset may also be abandoned by the Sky Ecosystem, formerly Maker DAO. The DeFi protocol still retains two pools with WBTC collateral but raised the issue of liquidating them and also switching to cbBTC. At the same time, other major DeFi protocols are holding a significant share of the WBTC supply. Aave V3 is the single biggest wallet, with inflows of 24.92% of all WBTC. The asset has also spread to Compound, Morpho, as well as Wormhole, and other bridges. The market maker Wintermute is one of the main users of WBTC, engaged in regular mints and burns. The usage of WBTC has not damaged the reputation or activity of all DeFi entities, and WBTC is still essential in multiple trading pairs, bridges, and lending collateral pools. The main advantage of WBTC is its traceability and transparency, with constantly updated proof of assets . Coinbase has claimed all cbBTC is backed by actual BTC but has not given a publicly known wallet with the actual BTC holdings.

According to a report , Ahlgren III has bagged a two-year sentence for falsely claiming his capital gains from Bitcoin (BTC) between 2017 and 2019. Ahlgren’s Deceptive Crypto Tax Evasion Scheme As per the case, Ahlgren III sold $3.7 million worth of Bitcoin but underreported it, marking the first criminal tax evasion solely based on cryptocurrency. According to court documents, Ahlgren III did not report or underreport the sale of $4 million worth of BTC. Ahlgren III, who invested in Bitcoin as early as 2011, purchased 1,366 BTC in 2015 using the Coinbase exchange. In October 2017, he decided to sell 640 BTC and used the funds to purchase a house in Park City, Utah. Ahlgren’s crime was lying to his accountant about the gains from the Bitcoin sales. He submitted a false summary of the gains. Notably, Ahlgren inflated the price at which he bought the Bitcoin, which is reflected in his 2017 federal tax income returns. Justice Department Explains Ahlgren’s Crime Interestingly, Ahlgren attempted to hide his BTC sales through the use of multiple wallets and also by exchanging Bitcoin for cash in person. All these should have been reported in his 2018 and 2019 tax returns. To account for his capital gains, Ahlgren engaged in blogging about mixers in May 2014. Stuart M. Goldberg, Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, noted that Ahlgren engaged in these lies despite earning millions. Rather than pay the taxes due from the trading of Bitcoin, Ahlgren chose to conceal his gains using different methods that eventually earned him a two-year sentence. Ahlgren’s case marks a shift from the several enforcements by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notably, the SEC has condemned corporate entities for noncompliance with regulatory guidelines. IRS Sounds Warning to Potential Tax Evaders In her remarks, Lucy Tan, acting special agent in charge of IRS-criminal investigation at the Houston Field Office, advised crypto traders to avoid tax evasion. According to her, with the current bullish cycle that has driven crypto prices high, some might be tempted not to pay taxes. Tan emphasized that such temptation could lead to a jail term in a federal prison. Many countries, including Russia are fine-tuning their crypto laws on tax to create clear ambiguity and formalize the sector.

This month, three projects— Qubetics ($TICS) , AAVE, and Near Protocol—are grabbing attention for their potential short-term gains. Each of these altcoins has made significant moves that analysts believe could lead to substantial returns in the coming months. Qubetics takes the lead with its innovative QubeQode IDE, simplifying blockchain adoption for developers and businesses alike. At the same time, AAVE is scaling up its lending capabilities, and Near Protocol is addressing key scalability challenges in its ecosystem. Let’s break down why these projects are being touted as the best altcoins to invest in for short term. Qubetics Simplifies Blockchain Development with QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a full-fledged ecosystem transforming how blockchain applications are built and deployed. Its QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for developers, offering tools that allow even non-coders to create blockchain solutions. The platform features drag-and-drop components, form-based configuration, and a rich library of pre-written code snippets, enabling businesses to incorporate blockchain functionalities with ease. For instance, a small e-commerce store owner could use QubeQode IDE to integrate tokenised loyalty points into their business without needing technical expertise. Similarly, a developer working on a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform can quickly deploy smart contracts by customising pre-built templates. This ease of use opens doors for businesses and entrepreneurs from all walks of life, making blockchain adoption more accessible than ever before. The ongoing Qubetics presale is capturing investor interest, and for good reason. Priced at $0.0311 during its twelfth stage, $TICS tokens have raised over $5.9 million, with 318 million tokens sold to over 9,000 holders. Analysts project that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 703.21% ROI. Longer-term predictions are even more exciting, with $TICS potentially reaching $15 post-mainnet launch—a staggering 48,092.91% ROI. To illustrate, an investment of $320,000 at the current presale price could grow to $154 million if $TICS hits $15 . With each presale stage lasting only seven days and a 10% price hike every Sunday, time is of the essence for investors seeking high short-term returns.

AAVE Scales Its Lending Platform with New Updates AAVE, a leading DeFi protocol, has made significant strides in improving its lending and borrowing ecosystem. This week, AAVE announced a major upgrade that enhances user security and optimises interest rates, making it even more attractive for both borrowers and lenders. These updates come at a time when DeFi adoption is surging, with AAVE seeing a 17% increase in total value locked (TVL) over the past week. Another noteworthy development is AAVE’s recent foray into decentralised stablecoins. The protocol’s new GHO stablecoin has gained significant traction, with early reports indicating a 10% increase in daily minting volumes. Analysts see this as a key step in expanding AAVE’s influence in the DeFi sector, offering more stability and utility to its ecosystem. These advancements position AAVE as a prime choice for short-term investors looking to capitalise on the growing DeFi market. With its robust infrastructure and ongoing innovations, AAVE remains one of the best altcoins to invest in for short term opportunities. Near Protocol Addresses Scalability and Developer Growth Near Protocol has always been about scalability, and recent developments show it’s doubling down on this promise. This week, the platform rolled out a new sharding mechanism that significantly improves transaction speeds and reduces costs. These upgrades have already led to a 15% increase in daily transactions, reflecting growing adoption among users and developers. Moreover, Near Protocol is attracting significant interest from the developer community. Reports indicate a 20% rise in active projects built on its network, thanks to its developer-friendly tools and grant programmes. These initiatives are helping Near stand out as a scalable and sustainable blockchain solution, making it a strong contender for short-term gains. Near Protocol’s emphasis on scalability and accessibility is why analysts consider it among the best altcoins to invest in for short term. Its growing ecosystem and recent improvements ensure that it remains competitive in an ever-evolving market. Conclusion If you’re seeking the best altcoins to invest in for short term, Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol should be at the top of your list. Qubetics is making blockchain development simpler with its QubeQode IDE, while AAVE is scaling its DeFi ecosystem with innovative solutions.

37601661,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=374612,1734124503,Solana Surpasses Ethereum as Top Ecosystem for New Developers in 2024: Report,"Electric Capital’s 2024 Developer Report has revealed that for the first time since 2016, Solana outpaced Ethereum as the leading blockchain ecosystem for attracting new developers. The breakthrough highlights Solana’s rapid growth, with 7,625 new devs joining the network in the last 12 months, representing an 83% year-over-year increase. Rise in Developer Activity The report , released on December 12, looked at more than 902 million code commits across 1.7 million repositories, showing that Solana’s developer community is the fastest-growing among large blockchain networks. This surge was fueled by strong participation from builders in Asia, where the network ranked as the number one platform for new programmers in India and number two in other major markets like the United States, the UK, Canada, and China. Reacting to the news, Solana credited its community-driven ethos and focus on scalability for playing major roles in its expansion. In 2024, it captured more than 81% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) trades, as well as 64% of NFT mint transactions across all chains. Additionally, its wallet activity reached 1.7 million users, a figure that is seven times higher than the next largest chain. However, Solana’s new-found status notwithstanding, Ethereum still remains the dominant blockchain for total developer activity. While it onboarded 1,169 fewer coders than its rival, globally, Ethereum continues to lead in metrics such as monthly active developers and code commits. Additionally, established builders with more than two years under their belts as contributors are at an all-time high on the Vitalik Buterin-fronted blockchain, with 70% of commits coming from them. Solana Making Small Strides Nonetheless, Solana’s growth reflects broader diversification trends within the crypto industry. Per Electric Capital’s study, one in three devs now work on several chains, up from less than 10% in 2015. The platform took advantage of this trend, positioning itself as an alternative for low-fee use cases, decentralized finance (DeFi), and NFTs. To highlight the progress, the chain overturned Ethereum across several measures this year, albeit momentarily, including beating its total weekly transaction fees and maximum extractable value (MEV) tips in July. Furthermore, in November, the platform’s DEXs hit a milestone with one-day trading numbers going past $5 billion for three consecutive days for the first time in its history. The activity peaked days later, leading to the network breaking another record when its monthly decentralized exchange volumes hit the $70 billion mark.

Here’s how,"Crypto analyst Steph (@Steph_iscrypto) has shared an intriguing technical analysis on XRP/USD, claiming that the “W” pattern formation could propel the token’s value to $35. This prediction has sparked widespread discussion among traders and analysts within the cryptocurrency community. The shared chart focused on a long-term monthly timeframe, illustrates a textbook double-bottom, often referred to as a “W” pattern in technical analysis. This bullish reversal formation is characterized by two consecutive troughs of approximately equal depth, separated by a peak. In this case, the breakout above the neckline (the horizontal resistance formed at the peak) suggests the potential for a significant upward price movement. This ‘W’ pattern could send #Xrp to $35 pic.twitter.com/PbYFzPhdyY — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 The Case for $35 XRP The technical reasoning behind the $35 projection lies in the measured move principle. According to Nic Johnson, a commentator on the analysis, the expected price target can be calculated by measuring the distance between the lowest point of the pattern and the neckline and extending that distance upward from the breakout point. This method gives a “conservative idea of an expected uptrend size.” He further noted that a more aggressive interpretation could double this projected movement, implying even greater potential for XRP . Community Reactions and Debates The analysis has triggered a wide spectrum of reactions on X. One user, The Raging Bull, expressed strong optimism, claiming that “anything under $100 is a shakeout price” and emphasizing the importance of XRP’s utility beyond mere chart analysis. He pointed out that price charts primarily serve as a tool for gauging retail trading behavior and should not overshadow the transformative potential of blockchain technology. However, not all reactions were supportive. Another user, Chadette, criticized the analysis, remarking , “So we are making things up now,” questioning the validity of such projections. Johnson responded to this skepticism by defending the technical analysis methodology, describing it as “technically correct and feasible.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Balancing Technical Analysis with Market Realities While the chart pattern suggests bullish potential, it is important to approach such projections cautiously. Although technical analysis is widely used, it does not account for external market factors such as regulatory developments, macroeconomic conditions, or XRP’s adoption as a utility token in real-world applications. Moreover, the ambitious target of $35 implies an over 15-fold increase from the current trading level of $2.33. Achieving such a price would require a combination of technical breakout momentum, significant market demand, and perhaps its integration into global financial systems.

Its cutting-edge AI technology drives this, blends perfectly with blockchain, creating first-time user experiences. As the platform continues to wave, now is the perfect time to join. Read more to discover what PropiChain does differently and how this can help you achieve financial freedom. PropiChain: Where Blockchain Meets Artificial Intelligence PropiChain’s crypto AI features are revolutionizing the crypto space and the real estate market, with many investors benefiting massively from them. AI primarily automates processes in carrying out real estate transactions, making tasks that were otherwise daunting seamless and stress-free. By joining PropiChain’s token presale, you also stand to gain from the following: Precise market analysis PropiChain’s AI utilizes advanced algorithms to analyze real-time data from multiple sources, including market trends, property values, and macroeconomic indicators, to give users actionable insights. This allows investors to anticipate big market movements before they happen and make smarter, strategic decisions. For example, suppose you’re looking to invest in a residential property in an emerging neighborhood. In that case, PropiChain’s crypto AI can predict the area’s value trajectory based on upcoming infrastructure projects, historical price patterns, and current buyer demand. With this information, you can confidently secure the property before prices skyrocket. Intelligent property suggestions PropiChain’s platform uses advanced property recommendation functionalities that ensure investors only spend their money on worthwhile assets. It suggests high-value properties by considering search history, user preferences, and prior investments. For example, if you frequently search for properties within New York City in the $85,000 to $90,000 price range, the platform observes this and suggests similar properties whenever you access it. Also, the AI tool is highly intelligent and can learn super fast. If you change any details from previous searches and continue with that trend, the machine picks that up quickly and makes new suggestions based on the most recent conditions. Accurate and automated property valuations PropiChain crypto AI provides a new benchmark of accuracy and clarity in property valuation. The platform processes large data sets of historical sales, market trends, property features, and economic indicators, ensuring objectivity in accurately pricing a property and guaranteeing that the price remains fair and current for both buyers and sellers. You can know the actual value of a property in a fast-growing suburb based on recent infrastructure development, changes to the immediate surroundings, and local amenities. This allows you to negotiate fair prices with the seller, removing any elements of value inflation. Helpful and advanced chatbots PropiChain also increases user interaction with AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants to ensure real-time support throughout real estate transactions. The chatbots are available 24/7 to guide users through the platform, answering queries and filtering listings according to personalized criteria such as location and budget.

This innovation closes the gap between the physical and digital worlds, making more interactive and engaging property transactions. It is only available via the token presale.

This can be instrumental in determining whether to purchase the property. PropiChain’s Edge in Real-World Asset Tokenization Beyond traditional real estate, PropiChain allows fractional ownership of virtual properties within the metaverse. Joining the token presale now when the price is still extremely low lets you invest in high-demand digital assets and diversify your portfolios.

37601202,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662099,1734123651,Bitcoin Stuck Between $99K And $102K – Analyst Explains Macro Situation,"Bitcoin has remained range-bound between $99,000 and $102,000 since breaking above the psychological $100,000 level. While the breakout initially sparked excitement among investors, the current price action reflects market indecision, with no clear direction for the weeks ahead. Concerns about a potential correction linger as the broader market awaits stronger signals to confirm the next trend. Related Reading: Solana To New ATH Before Christmas – Analyst Expects $300 Soon Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared insights on X, supported by data from CryptoQuant, highlighting two crucial support levels at $90,000 and $93,000. These levels represent key demand areas, underscoring that the market floor has moved higher—a positive sign of resilience even amid the uncertainty. According to Adler, these supports could act as safety nets, absorbing selling pressure if Bitcoin fails to sustain its momentum above $100,000. Despite the hesitation, Bitcoin’s ability to hold above $100,000 for consecutive days has provided some optimism among investors. It remains uncertain whether the market will break out of its current range to continue the bull run or face a correction. For now, all eyes are on Bitcoin’s price action near these critical levels as traders look for clues that could set the tone for the remainder of the year. Bitcoin Technical Details Explained Bitcoin has faced choppy price action recently, leaving the market in anticipation of the next big move, whether upward or downward. Traders and investors remain cautious, closely watching key technical and macroeconomic signals. The uncertainty has kept Bitcoin trading between $99,000 and $102,000 as market participants wait for a decisive breakout. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared a detailed macro analysis on X, shedding light on Bitcoin’s current position. According to Adler, the market has established two crucial support levels at $90,000 and $93,000, signaling that the overall market floor has shifted higher. These levels could act as strong safety nets if Bitcoin experiences a short-term pullback. Adler emphasized that these supports reflect growing confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential despite the current indecision. One notable observation is the decline in trading volume peaks, which presents a neutral signal. This indicates that traders avoid excessive risk, preferring to wait for clearer market signals before entering significant positions. The declining volume also suggests a reduced likelihood of extreme price volatility in the immediate term.

Any significant news or events could quickly trigger a breakout or breakdown, setting the stage for Bitcoin’s next major move. BTC Price Action Bitcoin is trading at $100,100 after failing to break above its all-time high of $103,600. The current consolidation reflects market indecision while the price remains above key demand levels. Bitcoin’s resilience above $100,000 suggests bullish momentum may still be in play, as buyers look for opportunities to push the price higher. However, the next few days will be critical. A correction could be imminent if Bitcoin fails to hold above the psychologically significant $100,000 level and struggles to find the momentum to surpass $103,600. Analysts warn that a break below $100,000 could trigger a wave of selling pressure, pushing the price toward lower support zones. The $93,000 level is a crucial area to watch during a downturn. Losing this key support would significantly heighten bearish risks, as it represents a critical demand zone for the market. A failure at this level could result in a sharper correction, potentially challenging Bitcoin’s bullish structure.

If bulls can maintain support and fuel a breakout above the all-time high, Bitcoin could enter a new price discovery phase. However, the high stakes make every move above or below these levels pivotal for short-term direction.

The Goldman Sachs analyst also revealed that the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin, currently on presale for cheap at $0.0243 , is gearing up for a 55,000% rally. He encouraged every profit-hungry investor to get in on this “opportunity of a decade” as the cheap altcoin holds massive short- and long-term profit potential. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Selling Out Fast As Investors Expect Massive 55,000% ROI The Goldman Sachs analyst mentioned at the outset revealed the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin’s incredible presale performance and profit projections after he observed a growing trend of Dogecoin millionaires accumulating the altcoin. Many even opt to sell their large holdings of Dogecoin to buy the WallitIQ (WLTQ) altcoin. This is a big deal as Dogecoin has enjoyed quite the resurgence this year, completing a 300% rally. Furthermore, the current sentiment among Dogecoin millionaires and its community is mostly bullish . Nevertheless, the mass migration of Dogecoin millionaires to WallitIQ (WLTQ) highlights the altcoin’s superior profit potential. As much as Dogecoin is delivering sizeable profits for Dogecoin millionaires and investors, the Goldman Sachs analyst believes the meme coin is approaching its elastic limit and will not hold out for much longer. This is mostly thanks to its large market cap and overabundant token supply. Conversely, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has unlimited, yet untapped market potential. The altcoin only has a total supply of one billion tokens, and its tokenomics structure is designed to create demand and drive its value to the moon after its launch. Its ongoing presale at $0.0243 has opened a fine opportunity for investors to make like the Dogecoin millionaires and accumulate WallitIQ (WLTQ) tokens ahead of its 55,000% surge. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Attracts Investor Interest With Revolutionary DeFi Wallet WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) innovative DeFi wallet is the biggest attraction driving massive interest and engagement in its presale. This is also why the Goldman Sachs analyst believes in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) long-term sustainability. Backed by SolidProof’s thorough audit , the digital asset storage and management system represents the evolution of DeFi wallets. It ingeniously tackles the problems of insecurity and poor user experience that plague existing crypto wallets. WallitIQ (WLTQ) incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to provide advanced security features and tools that better secure users’ details and assets than existing crypto wallets. The Goldman Sachs analyst praised WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) advanced Anomaly Detection, which monitors users’ wallets for unusual activity such as unauthorized login attempts. This way, users can identify security incidents and take appropriate measures such as changing passwords, enabling biometric authentication, etc. Dogecoin millionaires are especially attracted to WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) Fully DeFi Mode, which enables them to trade their cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer in a truly decentralized manner. This eliminates all intermediaries and centralized exchanges and their associated fees. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) most attractive aspect is its massive price predictions from leading crypto analysts. The Goldman Sachs analyst firmly believes the altcoin will surge 55,000% soon, given the intensity with which Dogecoin millionaires are stocking up on the token and advises investors to do the same before it sells out soon. Why You Should Join The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Today The Goldman Sachs analyst has said early investors will enjoy WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) price surges the most. As its presale roadmap reveals, those who purchase the token during its current presale stage will enjoy up to 358% ROI from the token’s price surges after each presale round. Meanwhile, that figure does not take the token’s projected massive 55,000% surge or the other price rallies that leading analysts believe the token will perform in 2025. Don’t miss this rare opportunity to earn massive profits and build generational wealth. Join the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale today and accumulate as many tokens as possible at $0.0243 to earn maximum returns. Delay will be detrimental!

According to a new announcement, Avalanche says that more than 40 companies participated in the sale, including SkyBridge, Hivemind and Morgan Creek Digital. A locked token sale means the tokens sold have certain vesting or lock-up periods. The proceeds will go toward supporting the blockchain’s upgrade called Avalanche9000. “The influx of capital follows the launch of the Avalanche9000 testnet, a key milestone that paves the way for the upcoming mainnet network upgrade on Monday, December 16th, which will reduce Avalanche layer-1 (L1) deployment costs by 99.9%, as well as reducing transaction costs on the established C-Chain by 25x.” The project expects the upgrade to increase network usage across several crypto sectors. “Avalanche9000 is driving the next generation of scalable, purpose-built L1 blockchains. More than 500 L1 chains are already in development across sectors like tokenization of real-world assets, loyalty and rewards, gaming, payments and institutional programs.” Jason Urban, Galaxy’s global head of trading, says the funding will boost blockchain technology innovation. “Our support of Avalanche, and the growth and scalability of blockchain protocols, is essential to the future of this industry.

37601426,https://blockworks.co/news/republican-nominees-for-house-committees,1734123600,Republicans nominate pro-crypto reps to lead key House committees,"This is a segment from the Forward Guidance newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . It’s that time of the year: Republicans are finalizing their picks for House committee and subcommittee chairs. For eagle-eyed crypto fans, you probably saw Rep. French Hill was nominated to chair the House Financial Services Committee. Also of note, Glenn Thompson is slated to hold on to his position as Agriculture Committee chair. Let’s run through what these representatives have said about crypto and what could be in store for policy next session: French Hill Hill was the first-ever chair of the House Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, serving for the past two years. Chair Maxine Waters created the subcommittee during the 116th Congress. It was expanded to also include crypto matters this session under Chair Patrick McHenry, who did not run for re-election. Since broadening its scope, subcommittee hearings have been held on DeFi , crypto market structure and the role of federal agencies. Hill received bipartisan support Thursday following his nomination announcement. Democrat Ritchie Torres, a fellow crypto-friendly rep, said he looks forward to continued bipartisan cooperation next session. Glenn Thompson You may be wondering what the Agriculture Committee has to do with finance. But this group actually tackles a lot of pressing issues, specifically with commodities and derivatives markets. As many crypto advocates push for more regulation from the CFTC and less from the SEC, the Ag Committee could prove crucial. Thompson introduced the Digital Commodity Exchange Act last session — a bill that went on to influence FIT21 , which passed through the Ag Committee and later the full House with backing from both parties. A major part of the legislation is granting the CFTC authority to oversee crypto spot markets, a distinction agency leadership and industry actors have supported. Thompson, a co-sponsor of FIT21, said last year the legislation had been drafted based on “extensive feedback from stakeholder and market participants.” The bill “aims to close existing authority gaps, ensuring US leadership in financial and technological innovation,” he added. Committee nominees must be ratified by the House Republican Conference, which is expected to meet next week. Meanwhile, over in the Senate, there’s still no word on if (or when) senators will vote to confirm SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw before Congress recesses next week. Senate Banking Committee Chair Sherrod Brown on Wednesday attributed the delay to Republican senators heeding “corporate special interests and standing in the way of [Crenshaw’s] nomination.” Next week should be interesting.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, pseudonymous crypto strategist Rekt Capital tells his 519,600 followers that it appears as if the top crypto asset by market cap’s technical uptrend will remain in place. “Bitcoin continues to hold its four-week technical uptrend line as support Bitcoin would likely need to lose this uptrend line if a deeper correction is to take place from these levels.

Moving on to the XRP rival Stellar, the analyst says in his newsletter that the digital asset has surpassed one of the most important reference points in terms of price and that any further pullbacks should be a retest of this zone. “The Binance Listing Price (green box) has historically been an important reference point for price. It has served as a strong resistance (pre-2019 and 2022) and it has served as a support (early 2021). Going forward, any deeper pullbacks should see XLM tag this region for a post-breakout retest of it; this region’s significance as a reference point cannot be understated and price has somehow managed to find ways to tag this region as support throughout its history.

The Illinois Treasury Department says residents are sitting on a serious pile of unclaimed assets, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. The assets are typically located in neglected bank accounts and safe deposit boxes and come from a variety of sources such as overpayments, inheritance and uncashed checks. After a three year period, the assets are typically transferred to the state for safekeeping, although items in safe deposit boxes may be sold. State residents can visit icash.illinoistreasurer.gov to file a claim. About 10% of Americans likely have unclaimed assets in their name, according to the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators. Most of the assets in questions are held by individual states, and in North Carolina the state treasurer is in control. The National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators has a website dedicated to unclaimed property, and the organization says it’s helped 10’s of millions of people track down more than $4 trillion in assets. A significant amount of money is also in forgotten 401(k) accounts, and the financial resource platform Bankrate has outlined a number ofways that people can track them down. One is to search the Department of Labor’s website, which maintains records of public and private sector businesses that provide employee benefit plans. Bankrate also recommends people contact their former employer directly and ask human resources to look up whether you took part in a 401(k) plan.

Market analysts suggest that with just $250 placed in specific altcoins, a portfolio could grow to an astonishing $2 million. This article reveals which cryptocurrencies might have the potential to turn a small amount into a life-changing fortune. CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors, positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges including Gate.io, and the listing is planned on December 14th. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning NEAR Protocol Shows Strong Gains but Faces Overbought Conditions NEAR Protocol’s price has climbed over 28% in the past month, currently ranging between $6.75 and $8.58. It sits slightly above its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, both around $6.95. The Relative Strength Index is above 70, signaling overbought conditions, while the MACD indicates positive momentum. The nearest resistance level is at $9.32, with support at $5.67. If the upward trend continues, NEAR could reach the second resistance at $11.14, marking a significant increase from current prices. However, the high RSI suggests a potential pullback. Traders are watching for a break above resistance or a dip below support to determine the next move. VeChain Shows Strong Monthly Gains Amid Minor Weekly Pullback VeChain (VET) has seen significant growth over the past month, with a price increase of over 119%. Despite a slight dip of 7% in the past week, the cryptocurrency remains in an upward trend. Trading within the $0.05-$0.08 range, VET faces its nearest resistance at $0.10. Breaking this level could pave the way to the second resistance at $0.13. The Relative Strength Index stands at 60.49, indicating bullish momentum. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are aligned at $0.06, supporting the current price. With positive MACD levels, VeChain may continue its upward movement, offering potential gains for investors. FET Nears Key Resistance After Steady Gains: Will the Uptrend Continue? Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET) has been trading between $1.78 and $2.27, showing a 26.98% increase over six months. The price is approaching the nearest resistance at $2.48. The Relative Strength Index is at 66.70, indicating momentum toward overbought levels. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close at $1.85 and $1.83, suggesting consolidation. The MACD level of 0.04 signals mild bullish momentum. If FET breaks above $2.48, it could target the second resistance at $2.97, offering potential gains. However, if it fails to surpass this level, the price may pull back toward the support at $1.49. Jupiter (JUP) Faces Resistance Amid Overbought Signals Jupiter’s price ranges between $1.14 and $1.49, showing a recent decrease of 7.65% over the past week and 4.38% over the past month. Despite short-term declines, it has gained 36.79% in the past six months. The Relative Strength Index stands at 70.55, indicating an overbought condition, while the Stochastic is at 84.88, supporting this view. The nearest resistance level is $1.64; breaking above this could propel the price toward the second resistance at $1.99, a potential increase of around 33%. However, if the price falls below the support at $0.94, it may drop further to the second support at $0.59. Traders should watch these key levels closely. Conclusion In the current bullish market of 2024, investors are seeking opportunities to multiply their portfolios. While altcoins like NEAR, VET, FET, and JUP offer potential, their short-term gains may be limited. CYBRO emerges as a standout option, providing unmatched prospects through its advanced DeFi platform. Leveraging AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO maximizes earnings with features such as generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. Its seamless deposit and withdrawal processes enhance the user experience. With a strong focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO attracts significant interest from crypto whales and influencers, positioning it as a promising project in the dynamic crypto market.

37600609,https://crypto.news/?p=14319355,1734122566,Should I HODL or buy more crypto? Binance offers investment advice,"Binance has shared its perspective on two key strategies for crypto investing: dollar-cost averaging and HODLing. The advice, published on the company’s blog , aims to guide investors through the volatile cryptocurrency market with a focus on long-term success. According to Binance, dollar-cost averaging involves automatically investing a set amount at regular intervals , regardless of market prices. This strategy helps investors mitigate the impact of market volatility by spreading purchases over time. For example, an investor allocating $200 monthly to Bitcoin ( BTC ) buys fewer units when prices are high and more when they are low, averaging out the overall cost. Binance suggested automating the process through features offered by crypto exchanges, making it a hands-off way to accumulate assets over time. You might also like: Exclusive: Vlad Gorbunov, founder of Choise.ai ecosystem, discusses new meme bank platform that brings utility to meme coins HODLing HODLing, a term originating as a typo of “holding,” refers to buying and retaining cryptocurrency regardless of short-term market swings. Binance emphasized that this approach relies on selecting fundamentally strong assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ), that have historically increased in value over the long term. The note also said that HODLing requires strong conviction in the asset’s future growth and isn’t suitable for everyone. In addition to these strategies, Binance stressed the importance of diversification . A balanced portfolio might include Bitcoin as a store of value, Ethereum for its smart contract capabilities, and other growth-oriented tokens such as Solana ( SOL ) and XRP ( XRP ). Diversifying across multiple assets reduces exposure to the risks of any single investment. To further manage risks, Binance recommended holding stablecoins to navigate market downturns and exploring staking or yield farming to earn passive income. The company also advised investors to use secure storage solutions, such as hardware wallets, and to rely on portfolio trackers to monitor investments.

Riot lowered its 2025 hash rate target from 56.6 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 46.7 EH/s.

To read full editions, subscribe . MicroStrategy could later this month join the Nasdaq 100, which includes many of the largest non-financial, Nasdaq-listed companies. A Nasdaq spokesperson told me changes to the index would be announced tonight at 8 pm ET. Adjustments would go into effect on Dec. 23. MicroStrategy’s market capitalization stands around $95 billion and appears to meet the requirements for inclusion, analysts say. But the Nasdaq committee’s decision could depend on MSTR’s ICB classification, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart mentioned in a recent research note. Much of the company’s share performance is linked to financial engineering derived from its bitcoin buys, he explained; whether this could make it a “financial” stock (and ineligible) remains to be seen. While TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza puts odds of MSTR’s Nasdaq 100 inclusion in the 60-80% range (noting its operating software business sets it apart from traditional financial companies), he told me he wouldn’t be surprised if it was kept out. Benchmark’s Mark Palmer said the stock — already up 480% this year — could see another boost as Nasdaq 100 inclusion would enable MSTR to benefit from giant passive funds (like Invesco’s QQQ) buying blocks of shares. Vitanza said he isn’t so sure inclusion in the index would cause any sort of price spike. Still, it would certainly broaden the universe of investors, he added, which would augment the company’s long-term access to capital. TD Cowen analysts raised their price target for the stock from $525 to $550 on Monday. MSTR shares were trading at ~$397 at 2 pm ET. “If they were to be kept out of the index,” he told me, “that would not change our view of the stock one iota.” Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

37600149,https://crypto.news/?p=14319333,1734121691,BiT Global sues Coinbase for $1b over WBTC delisting,"Justin Sun-backed BiT Global has sued crypto exchange Coinbase for unfairly delisting WBTC to uplift a competing Bitcoin product. BiT Global launched a $1 billion lawsuit against Coinbase, alleging the U.S. crypto exchange illegally replaced its Wrapped Bitcoin ( WBTC ) product with a “knock-off” cbBTC token. Wrapped Bitcoin was the first tokenized Bitcoin ( BTC ) asset in crypto, allowing users trade BTC on networks like Ethereum. BitGo initially oversaw custody for WBTC since its January 2019 launch. However, BitGo announced a deal in August 2020 to share operations among three companies, including Sun’s BiT Global. The new deal reached, a subject of intense community criticism, assigned Hong Kong-based BiT Global as the primary WBTC custodian. Several protocols, like Aave and Sky, considered removing the token as a collateral option, but refrained from taking action. Coinbase said it would delist WBTC effective Dec. 19, 2024, due to listing standards, crypto.news reported in late November. This came after Coinbase unveiled its cbBTC token on its layer-network Base and Ethereum on Sept. 12, initially teasing the token in the wake of ongoing WBTC controversy. You might also like: News WBTC price flash crashes on Binance below $6k days after Coinbase delisting Legal consultants from Kneupper & Covey, BiT Global’s attorneys, alleged that Coinbase’s WBTC delisting violated anti-compete policies and federal rules. We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space. If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe? And who’s next? Kevin Kneupper of Kneupper & Covey According to the lawsuit, Coinbase citing listing standards was also an inadequate reason for the decision. Documents filed in the Northern District of California cited Coinbase listing “fundamentally valueless” memecoins like Pepe (PEPE).

37600151,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98850,1734121663,"How This Crypto Whale Turned $3,000 to $73 Million","A smart crypto trader has stunned the market with huge profits from Pepe coin (PEPE). This comes after the token consistently rose to new levels, hitting a new all-time high before a slight correction. After about 20 months of holding the assets, the trader turned $3K worth of PEPE into $73 million, to the community’s delight. On-chain data shows the trader made a total of 24,665% and moved several assets, raking in a profit as well as current holdings in the green zone. In April 2023, he bought $3K worth of PEPE, about 4.9 trillion tokens, before holding the asset across the steady climb. A Handful of Sales On multiple occasions, the trader sold part of his holdings. He ignited huge sales in May and continued them before a pause on May 8. However, offloads of huge assets spiked in February 2024 following the crypto market upturn. Institutional investors poured large amounts of assets into these funds after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. This led to a spike in Bitcoin price, hitting a new high above $73K before a correction. The jump in the market leader led to an altcoin and meme token rally, pushing meme coins to new highs. The total meme token market cap spiked above $70 billion, leading to sharp sales as traders looked to make gains. On Dec 10, the PEPE whale moved 100 billion tokens worth $2.8 million. Overall, the trader liquidated 3.03 trillion tokens for approximately $27.5 million and currently holds 1.88 trillion PEPE worth about $73 million. “ Turning $3K into $73M, a 24,656x return, what a legend! Before the market plummeted, $PEPE broke through $0.000028, setting a new #ATH! This legendary trader sold another 100B $PEPE($2.8M) for profit. This trader invested ~$3K to buy 4.91T $PEPE on Apr 15, 2023. Over time, he steadily sold $PEPE, cashing out 3.03T $PEPE for $27.5M. He still holds 1.88T $PEPE($45.66M), bringing his total profit to an incredible $73M!” What’s Next For Meme Coins? Crypto enthusiasts are moving funds to meme coins to notch gains due to their volatility. Since Bitcoin swung forward after the United States elections, meme coins have followed a similar trajectory. Elon Musk-backed Dogecoin (DOGE) saw massive inflows after Donald Trump’s win , climbing over 70% in the last 30 days. This year, DOGE’s price is up 289%, trading at $0.4. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE also recorded skyrocketing gains this year.

Large holders continue to buy, anticipating expected price gains amid a volatile crypto market. PEPE price turned against the wider market direction, showing signs of a breakout in the green zone. This month, on-chain charts show whales increasing holdings by $1.14 billion, igniting positive sentiments in the meme coin ecosystem. In the same time frame, wallets with holdings above $10 million worth of PEPE increased 147%. Despite these gains in institutional adoption, retail took a tumble, as expected, due to the overall ecosystem. Users with less than $10 saw holdings drop 26%, while traders between $100 and $1000 saw holdings grow 21%. Meanwhile, users with $1 million and $10 million worth of holdings spiked 119%, signifying a shift to institutional investors. The decline in retail holders is linked to the recent market correction, as smallholders dump tokens to reduce losses. Similarly, crypto analytics firm Lookonchain flagged several whale wallets acquiring assets. In the early hours of the day, nine wallets spent 13.8 million DAI tokens to obtain 555 billion PEPE. Impact of Whale Accumulations Traditionally, whale positions influence the market due to the size of their holdings. Recent huge purchases are expected to raise the price to new points as the bull cycle continues to evolve. The PEPE price stands at $0.000024 when writing, up 5% in the past 24 hours. This slight gain shows a move above waters, unlike other assets in its class. PEPE has recorded 22% weekly gains and over 100% growth last month . The inflow of whales also led to several projections across crypto spaces. X user @jakecazz pointed to the bullish run of these assets, tipping the meme coin season. “ BTC pumps. As BTC dominance drops, and alts run. Finally, high-beta assets like meme coins explode. Today: $PEPE is green and showing relative strength to nearly everything while alts are red.

In a Dec. 13 complaint, BiT Global alleges that Coinbase’s decision to delist wBTC was to promote its own competing product, cbBTC, that has caused massive financial losses and deteriorated consumer confidence in wBTC. We regularly monitor the assets on our exchange to ensure they meet our listing standards. Based on our most recent review, Coinbase will suspend trading for wBTC (wBTC) on December 19, 2024, on or around 12pm ET. — Coinbase Assets (@CoinbaseAssets) November 19, 2024 The lawsuit covers allegations of attempted monopolization of the wrapped Bitcoin market under the Sherman Act, claims of predatory practices to undermine wBTC’s market position and accusations of false statements implying wBTC failed to meet listing standards. Lawsuit Claims Coinbase Delisted WBTC to Gain Monopoly The lawsuit further alleged that Coinbase’s listings of meme coins and tokens such as Dogwifhat (WIF), Pepe (PEPE) and Mog Coin (MOG) that have “no inherent value” proves that the exchange delisted WBTC in a bid to have a monopoly over the industry. It also restated that delisting WBTC in place of these memecoins proves that the exchange did not follow any defined listing standards. “Like all the centralized tech giants before it, Coinbase gives lip service to the innovation of a decentralized world,” the firm’s lawsuit noted. “But in the case of wrapped Bitcoin, Coinbase viewed it as just another cash grab.” Notably, Coinbase launched its own wrapped Bitcoin token in September, called Coinbase Wrapped BTC, or cbBTC. Last month, it delisted WBTC citing that it did not meet the exchange’s listing standards. Coinbase Capturing Market Share However, BiT Global alleged Friday that this was an unfair business practice. “Having decided to copycat WBTC with its own product, Coinbase resorted to unfair and deceptive tactics that long been used by tech giants to crush their competition,” BiT Global’s lawsuit noted. The crypto custodian stated in the lawsuit that WBTC’s circulation fell by 5% within two weeks of its delisting. They argued this was evidence that Coinbase aimed to capture WBTC’s market share for itself. The BitGlobal complaint noted that Coinbase’s decision to list Mog just two weeks after delisting wBTC shows that the decision had “nothing to do with standards and everything to do with unfairly and fraudulently pushing wBTC out of the market.” Lawsuit Seeks $1 Billion! The suit was filed by law firm Kneupper & Covey in the Northern District of California. “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the cryptocurrency space,” stated attorney Kevin Kneupper. “If an exchange of Coinbase’s size can delist a cryptocurrency just as it plans to launch its own competing product, who’s safe?

37599324,https://thecoinrise.com/sol-strategies-eyes-nasdaq-debut-after-epic-stock-surge/,1734120164,Sol Strategies Eyes Nasdaq Debut After Epic Stock Surge,"Sol Strategies, a publicly traded Canadian company that provides infrastructure support for Solana blockchain, has set eyes on Nasdaq. As per the report , the publicly traded crypto holding previously identified as Cypherpunk gave the update on Thursday. The announcement came after its stock, with the ticker HODL on the Canadian Securities Exchange, registered a 2,336% spike. This figure represents its growth between July and now. Sol Strategies Makes Play for Nasdaq Listing According to Leah Wald, Chief Executive of Sol Strategies, the move to list positions the company to increase liquidity. It also guarantees accessibility to investors in multiple markets. A strategic angle to the listing is that Sol Strategies can capitalize on investment opportunities within the Solana ecosystem. This ensures that the firm’s operational costs are covered without liquidating its long-term holdings. Beyond these, listing on the Nasdaq will increase liquidity, brand visibility, and a broader investor base. Sol Strategies’ commitment to the Solana ecosystem has grown as it currently holds over 142,000 SOL tokens, estimated at $32 million (or 46 million Canadian dollars). The company has acquired four additional Solana validators, with staking now a critical part of the Sol Strategies approach. What is Driving the Transition from Bitcoin to Solana? As “Cypherpunk Holdings” bet huge on Bitcoin, the company offered a path for investors interested in getting crypto exposure. However, market dynamics have shifted, and Bitcoin exposure is readily available through exchange-traded products, crypto exchanges, and other options. Since Wald assumed her role as CEO, the company has greatly reduced its Bitcoin holdings from hundreds to just about 3 BTC. This shift occurred before Bitcoin surged to the $100,000 price level. Wald explained that the shift from Bitcoin aligned with the company’s decision to embrace Solana. Its move on Solana mirrors the earlier Bitcoin bet. Sol Strategies might be betting on increased demand for exposure to the Solana ecosystem . Already, Solana is making waves in attracting new developers to the ecosystem and recently surpassed Ethereum on this front. Commitment to Solana Ecosystem Development Sol Strategies has consistently focused on expanding its portfolio investment in Solana-based startups. According to Wald, efforts were made to collaborate with the developer communities to promote innovation. It aims to do this via grants, educational programs, and partnerships.

Bitcoin Suisse shared the forecast in its outlook for the next year, with key points including the U.S. adopting a Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve as other countries follow and BTC trading to an all-time high above $180’000. The Swiss-regulated crypto startup also foresees financial giants stepping up to unveil institutional rollups on Ethereum ( ETH ). However, one of its biggest projections for 2025 is that Ethereum-staking ETFs could surpass Bitcoin ETFs. “While Bitcoin ETFs shattered records with $32B in net flows and IBIT now approaching $50B in AUM in just 225 trading days, we project a structural shift of flows into ETH ETFs in the post-election environment.” Bitcoin Suisse Outlook 2025. Read more: Bitwise CIO: Ethereum ETFs came too early Bitcoin Suisse points to key fundamentals for its Ethereum ETFs 2025 prediction. One of these is the risk-reward proposition Ether ETFs offer as institutional demand surges. An example is the flip in capital flows in November, which had Ethereum ETFs outpacing Bitcoin ETFs in daily flows – $332.9 million for ETH compared to $320 million for BTC. ETH’s underperformance was more due to Bitcoin having a head start as an established narrative. The regulatory headwinds that surrounded staking yields also contributed. Removing these bottlenecks could cause ETH ETFs to take off massively. “Under the new Trump administration, we expect a swift approval for ETH staking in ETFs, eventually unlocking a 3-4% yield, which strongly caters to institutional allocators and is particularly compelling in a declining rate environment. We project that staking yields will disproportionately benefit Ethereum and emerge as the primary catalyst for sustained constructive flows into ETH ETFs.” Other projections for 2025 include the approval of new crypto ETFs, the startup predicts.

With over 30 million users spanning 170 countries and daily trading volumes topping $7 billion, MEXC offers a global stage for $CYBRO to expand its reach and liquidity. Earlier, CYBRO announced its debut on Gate.io , another top-tier CEX. Boasting 19 million active users and an average daily trading volume of $8 billion, this platform opens the door to a wider audience , so it could further cement CYBRO’s presence in the crypto market. On both exchanges, users will be able to trade the CYBRO/USDT pair starting December 14, 2024. Notably, CYBRO is approaching the listings phase on a strong footing. On December 3rd, it successfully concluded a presale of $CYBRO tokens 20 days ahead of its initially planned completion at the end of December. The presale enabled CYBRO to raise $7 million in initial funding and attract nearly 20,000 holders. Furthermore, CYBRO burned 500 million tokens in November to ensure greater price stability. These developments reflect CYBRO's ongoing efforts to expand its footprint in the decentralized finance sector. CYBRO’s Impact on the Evolution of Decentralized Finance CYBRO has entered the decentralized finance (DeFi) space with a mission to streamline investing for both seasoned players and newcomers. It strives to address critical pain points that have long hindered user adoption and satisfaction. One of the biggest challenges in DeFi is navigating the revenue intransparency. Promises of high yields often come with shifting parameters or poorly communicated risks, leaving investors in the dark. CYBRO counters this by offering clear and consistent projections, paired with transparent strategies that give users a firm grasp on potential earnings. Portfolio management, another weak link in the DeFi chain, sees a marked upgrade with CYBRO. Missing timely alerts about inactive pools or declining returns could leave users vulnerable to missed opportunities. CYBRO’s real-time updates and tracking tools aim to keep investors ahead of the curve. The user experience in DeFi also remains a significant barrier, especially for newcomers. Complex interfaces can lead to confusion and errors. CYBRO counters this with a streamlined onboarding process, AI-driven investment tools , and straightforward return tracking capabilities. These achievements will soon be complemented by upcoming features designed to further enhance the user experience. CYBRO’s Next Steps CYBRO is rolling out a series of innovations designed to make decentralized finance (DeFi) more user-friendly and efficient. Two standout features are Zap-in and AI-Broker, each addressing specific needs within the DeFi space. Zap-in streamlines the process of depositing and withdrawing funds by allowing users to transact in tokens that differ from the pool's native currency. This eliminates the often cumbersome process of converting tokens. Meanwhile, AI-Broker , slated for release in Q1 2025, is an advanced assistant powered by artificial intelligence. This tool will enable users to design and manage custom on-chain investment strategies. In addition, CYBRO plans to integrate fiat functionality into its ecosystem, a milestone that could significantly broaden its appeal to traditional investors. The upcoming wallet with a payment card feature will allow users to seamlessly convert their crypto earnings into fiat and spend them as they would with conventional currency. This development is expected to enhance liquidity input and output, making the platform more accessible to users unfamiliar with DeFi mechanics. These improvements highlight CYBRO’s commitment to empowering users of all experience levels to navigate the complexities of decentralized finance with ease and confidence.

The RSI around 57 indicates improving momentum, while the MACD’s positive level suggests bullish signals. If DOGE surpasses the resistance at $0.54, it could target the next level at $0.64, offering a potential gain of over 25%. The alignment of the 10-day and 100-day moving averages at $0.42 hints at consolidation before a breakout. With a 6-month surge of over 200%, Dogecoin appears poised for significant growth as the anticipated altcoin season sets in. Shiba Inu eyes potential breakout amid bullish indicators Shiba Inu is showing signs of upward movement. Its price ranges between $0.00002806 and $0.00003490, staying above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. The Relative Strength Index is at 61.34, indicating positive momentum. If SHIB surpasses the nearest resistance level at $0.00003759, it could target the next resistance at $0.00004443, which is a significant increase from current levels. The MACD level suggests bullish momentum may be building.

The last dip, which saw the asset’s price below the level, triggered diverse reactions as traders repositioned holdings. Flows into Bitcoin and other crypto assets have flipped green in the last 48 hours. On-chain data shows a crypto whale purchased 2000 BTC in two transactions at different price points. The first transaction of 1000 BTC, approximately $96.8 million, occurred on Dec 10. This came as whales sought to buy the dip, setting sights on a higher price. Bitcoin traded at $96,749 at the time of this transaction and has taken an upward turn. On Dec 12, the whale purchased another 1000 BTC for $101 million. Both transactions have attracted a positive spark from the community. As Bitcoin prices increase, traders have projected similar swings in the coming months. Wider Market Accumulation Spikes This whale’s transfer is one of several leading to heightened sentiments in the crypto market. According to data from Lookonchain , after the asset’s price reclaimed $100K, a whale swooped 201 BTC worth approximately $20.3 million. The holder has amassed 1,502 BTC worth $152 million since Nov 24. This year ushered several events that led to increased Bitcoin adoption. Institutional inflows picked up after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. These inflows led to a rising price and multiple all-time highs. As firms continue to raise projections across the next five years, whale accumulations will be seen across the ecosystem. Meanwhile, the number of assets in centralized exchanges has declined in the last 30 days. This upward signal shows traders preparing for a long-term holding period. “ When we examine the data, we see that a large amount of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from spot exchanges, especially in recent days. This data, observed while the price is rising, indicates that investors are continuing to accumulate Bitcoin. It seems that investors are anticipating new all-time high (ATH) levels for Bitcoin,” a CryptoQuant analyst wrote. Aside from Bitcoin, altcoins have recorded massive inflows since the US elections. A spike in BTC price impacts the wider market, with traders moving funds to altcoins and meme tokens in anticipation of more gains.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Crypto analyst Astekz sees a bright future for Shiba Inu (SHIB) as DTX Exchange (DTX) and Ripple (XRP) show bullish indicators. Table of Contents Astekz: Shiba Inu has parabolic potential DTX Exchange: A presale star with 500% growth XRP price rises, indicators point to more growth SHIB, DTX, XRP: The first altcoin to surge The crypto market is seeing big price movements, with tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Ripple (XRP) soaring. Well-known crypto analyst Astekz has forecasted a bullish scenario for SHIB as XRP shows technical indicators in the buy zone. Amid this movement, DTX Exchange (DTX) has shocked investors with its ICO event, with its price rising by 500%. Many experts hint that this crypto coin could be the next 4x token in 2025. Astekz: Shiba Inu has parabolic potential Shiba Inu is one of the meme coin titans known for their strong communities. Analyst Astekz excited this community with his Shiba Inu price forecast. In a new X post, Astekz said that the Shiba Inu price may see a parabolic rise from its current price. Data shows that SHIB has soared from around $0.000025 to over $0.000027 on the one-month chart. The technicals for SHIB also show good signs. The meme coin is valued above its 30-day EMA ($0.000026) and its 50-day EMA ($0.000024). Furthermore, its bull-bear power sits at −0.0000036 in the buy zone, suggesting that bulls are in control. DTX Exchange: A presale star with 500% growth DTX Exchange is making waves in the crypto market with its great presale performance. Notably, this rookie has already given early buyers a 500% return. Since its presale is currently in phase six, more price increases are expected as there are plenty of stages left. The recent CoinMarketCap listing of this altcoin could also open the door to millions of new traders to set their eyes on it. The DTX Exchange will give access to over 120k asset classes like stocks, gold, and crypto coins at 1000x leverage and transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds. Traders are also interested in the DTX token because of all the perks they will get by holding it. For example: Governance voting rights: The ability to vote on important issues concerning the future of DTX Exchange. Revenue-sharing model: DTX holders will get a portion of the trading fee revenue generated by the platform. Staking: DTX stakers will earn up to 15% APY in staking rewards. Currently, one DTX costs $0.12. This price is 500% higher than when this crypto ICO event started at $0.02. Once phase seven starts, DTX will cost $0.14. Not only that, a Tier-1 CEX listing is expected to trigger a rally to $0.20, providing a 66% return for those who buy the altcoin at current prices. XRP price rises, indicators point to more growth XRP is an altcoin showing signs of a breakout. The coin is trading above its 10-day EMA ($2.31). Furthermore, its bull-bear power has an indicator of 0.16 in the buy zone, suggesting bulls could push its value up. The Ripple price has grown over 300% on the one-month chart. In that period, its value moved between $0.58 and $2. Crypto analyst Amonyx took note of this XRP performance. In a recent X post, he told his followers that the next move will be massive for the coin, suggesting a potential surge to $64. SHIB, DTX, XRP: The first altcoin to surge Although SHIB and XRP could see gains down the line, many experts are focusing on DTX. The 500% growth in its ongoing presale shows the potential that it has to surge in a fast period. Since DTX will have a smaller market cap than its peers, it will need less money for its price to rise. Thus, experts foresee a potential 4x surge for DTX in 2025.

Now, a new AI-driven token priced at a mere $0.06 is attracting attention. With projections aiming for a staggering 10,000% return by 2025, it presents a potential chance to enter at the ground level. This development could be the next significant player in the digital currency arena. $CYBRO Targets 1000% Growth Post-Listing With $7 Million Raised CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace, is about to hit a major milestone with its Token Generation Event (TGE). After a lightning-fast presale that raised an impressive $7 million and drew in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is now gearing up for its listing on Gate.io and other major exchanges — and it’s happening on December 14th. During the presale, $CYBRO’s price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project. Join CYBRO Before the Listing Frenzy Drives Prices to the Moon What’s behind the hype? CYBRO combines cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly platform, offering tools like staking, farming, and lending that make DeFi investing accessible to everyone — from cautious newcomers to bold risk-takers. During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO’s platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation.

Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Solana and SOL: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability and supports apps, competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It aims for faster transactions through its design and offers flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana’s own cryptocurrency and plays a central role in its network. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards supporters. SOL holds value by underpinning Solana’s operations, rewarding participants, and giving users access to various projects on the platform. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn’t rely on splitting its network or adding extra layers to improve scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network suitable for hosting demanding products and services.

37598695,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98844,1734119036,We’re Going To Do Something Great With Crypto” Donald Trump Reaffirms Bitcoin Stance,"The United States President-elect Donald Trump has restated his commitment to make the country a digital asset powerhouse. This adds to the plans and policies Trump has rolled out for the industry ahead of the inauguration. Initial reaction to the statements sent bullish spikes in hourly trading data as holders anticipated positive regulations. With CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Trump responded to questions about rolling out a strategic crypto reserve similar to the oil sector. He affirmed that his administration will do something great with crypto because of the sector’s potential in modern finance. Digital assets are tipped to revolutionize the sector, enhance cross-border payments and increase adoption. Trump and pro-crypto executives believe sectors’ use cases, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi), could give consumers control and help cushion the effects of negative macro trends. United States To Become A Leader A major campaign promise of Trump’s team is to make the country a leader in crypto and other emerging technologies like blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Trump pledged support for the crypto industry to boost innovation in the country. The former President also tipped a strategic Bitcoin Reserve as his administration seeks to end asset sales. This led to an upswing in momentum because the US adopting Bitcoin could open up wider channels into major jurisdictions. Senator Cynthia Lummis pushed for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill to allow the government to acquire 1 million BTC for five years and hold over the next 20 years. Notably, Trump wants the country to be ahead of China and Russia, amongst others, in crypto. “… yeah I think so, we’re gonna do something great with crypto cause we don’t want China not just China, others are embracing it and we want to be ahead. We want to be ahead AI and we are going to produce tremendous amounts of electricity… we need more than twice what we already have.” A Shift From The Biden Administration President Biden has been criticized for his administration’s stance on crypto assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed several lawsuits against industry leaders and firms, lowering overall sentiments. This hostile regulation by enforcement approach on the sector led to an exodus to friendly jurisdictions.

37598699,https://crypto.news/?p=14317941,1734119020,"Exclusive: Vlad Gorbunov, founder of Choise.ai ecosystem, discusses new meme bank platform that brings utility to meme coins","Vlad Gorbunov, founder of the Choise.ai ecosystem, discusses the future of the meme coin space and explains how the team’s new Meme Bank can transform the sector by providing meme coins with utility-driven features such as token burns and staking rewards, along with real-world applications like payments via Visa/Mastercard bank cards with bespoke designs. CN: Vlad, can you elaborate on the future of the meme coin sector? Do you think meme coins can transform from hype-driven assets to solid, long-term performers, especially in light of recent headlines about the meme coin hype cooling down? VG: Meme coins are a quintessential reflection of the new investment culture. At first glance, they might seem like frivolous creations with no intrinsic value, purchased purely for entertainment or speculative purposes. However, it’s worth noting that Bitcoin was once in a similar position. In its early days, Bitcoin had no tangible value — its worth was built on a collective belief in its potential. This phenomenon mirrors broader financial markets, whether in stocks or other investment spaces, where community confidence helps companies achieve valuations 100 or 200 times their annual revenues or profits. Similarly, meme coin communities, often million-strong, hold onto their tokens not because of inherent utility but because of a shared belief in the token’s future. For some, the appeal lies in the humor or ideology behind the memes; for others, it’s the perceived “uselessness” that makes these coins intriguing. Memes themselves have become intertwined with events and various ideas, embedding them firmly in modern cultural expressions. So, meme coins have solidified their place as a phenomenon that isn’t likely to fade anytime soon. Their market capitalization continues to set records, with year-to-date price changes exceeding 10,000%. As one of the fastest-growing niches in the bull market, meme coins now rank fourth behind currencies, chains, and stablecoins. The world’s most influential people, like Elon Musk and Donald Trump, align themselves with the meme coin culture, demonstrating their understanding of the movement that resonates with large audiences. Market researchers project the meme coin sector has the potential to surpass $1 trillion, signaling that we’re at the beginning of a new cycle that could drive mass adoption. Yet, can meme coins transform into sustainable, long-term investment vehicles? The answer is likely no. They are more apt to remain speculative instruments, prone to delivering astronomical returns. Take $POPCAT, which alone has surged over 6,400% in 2024. However, this dynamic isn’t entirely different from that of other cryptocurrencies. Ultimately, the driving force behind meme coins is the same as that for any digital asset: community sentiment. One thing that can improve meme coins’ position is utility. And this is where Meme Bank enters the picture. You might also like: Vote for the best crypto project! CN: But how can Meme Bank ensure its utility-driven approach will resonate in a market that prioritizes excitement over real value? VG: The goal of Meme Bank isn’t to diminish the emotional value, excitement, or hype surrounding meme coins; in fact, it amplifies them by transforming this energy into a foundation for creating tailored products that empower specific meme coins with practical use cases. These products enhance the functionality of meme coins, offering features that integrate them into everyday activities. In doing so, Meme Bank not only strengthens and expands the utility of meme coins but also boosts its visibility and investment appeal. CN: Can you elaborate on the utilities Meme Bank will provide to meme token holders and what the potential use cases for it are? VG: Utility refers to the ability of a coin to perform specific functions that provide tangible benefits or support a broader economy. Take Binance Coin, which creates consistent demand through clear functionality, including reduced transaction fees of 25–30% on Binance. Additionally, holders who stake BNB contribute to its ecosystem, as portions of the token are utilized, burned, or repurchased, ensuring its active integration within Binance’s operations. In the meme coin world, communities like BONK occasionally distribute NFTs or rewards to top holders, but such initiatives fall short of offering true utility. Acting as a crypto bank for meme coins, Meme Bank will enable these tokens to serve as functional currencies for transactions, exchanges, and withdrawals. Users can even issue Visa and Mastercard cards featuring unique meme designs, deposit their meme coins onto these cards, and use them globally for shopping, bill payments, and more. These practical applications will also generate revenue through transaction fees paid by users when they send meme coins to a card or make any other transactions. This revenue can be further reinvested into the ecosystem. For example, if a million transactions generate $10 million in fees, $5 million could be allocated to reducing meme token supply via buybacks and burns, increasing scarcity and value. Alternatively, users could stake their meme coins within the Meme Bank ecosystem and earn a share of the revenue as a reward. Through these mechanisms, Meme Bank will foster stronger, more engaged meme coin communities. Initially, Meme Bank will focus on working with meme coin communities, developing tailored solutions to meet their specific needs. Over time, the platform will open up to broader participation, allowing any community to vote for a given meme coin to gain a dedicated meme bank platform. Governance will be community-driven through DAO mechanisms, enabling members to influence key decisions such as card designs, transaction fees, and other banking features. CN: The CHO token will be integrated into every Meme Bank transaction — what advantages and benefits will this bring to the Choise.ai ecosystem? VG: The resources for developing Meme Bank are provided by Choise.ai and Vault, a leading provider of white-label crypto banking solutions. They equip Meme Bank with the necessary infrastructure to launch meme banks swiftly and efficiently. Vault already supports over 50 enterprises worldwide, typically generating revenue by charging clients for its services. However, with the Meme Bank platform, meme coin communities will be able to launch their own dedicated meme banks without the need for licenses or significant upfront investments. Instead, Vault will leverage the Meme Bank project to showcase its own solutions to vibrant, large-scale meme coin communities, driving millions of transactions. Choise.ai and its extensive community of CHO token holders stand to benefit from each of these transactions. A portion of the revenue will be allocated to burning CHO tokens, increasing their scarcity and value. This process will take place seamlessly in the background, without affecting the meme coins themselves. To ensure transparency and foster engagement, real-time dashboards will display burning volumes. Choise.ai and Vault strongly believe in the vast potential of meme coin communities. The top three meme coin ecosystems — DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE — already boast over 7 million token holders, many of whom are actively profiting from these assets or aspiring to do so. Meme Bank represents a groundbreaking initiative to unlock this potential further, propelling meme coin trading far beyond its current 11-digit volume. CN: If you could sum up Meme Bank’s mission in a single word or phrase, what would it be? VG: Meme Bank’s mission is to become the premier utility provider for meme coins, elevating their functionality while maintaining their hype and emotional allure.",POSITIVE,BNB,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | BNB,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/founder-of-choise-ai-ecosystem-discusses-new-meme-bank-platform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37598699.jpeg

In a new announcement, The Bank of England says that the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) – the UK’s financial regulator – is looking to gather data on firms’ current and future exposure to crypto assets. “This [data] will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on crypto assets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures, analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options and providing an updated view of firms’ current and intended crypto asset-related business activities as a base from which to monitor the financial stability implications of these assets.” Some of the disclosure requirements include any business related to digital assets and how the bank profits from it, risk management policies of the bank toward crypto, a rundown of how the bank reports its crypto assets, and the most significant crypto-related risks the firms are exposed to and how they plan to manage them, according to the PRA’s questionnaire. “The decision to hold crypto assets (either under trading or banking book) and provide services to crypto asset operators must be fully consistent with the bank’s risk appetite and strategic objectives as set down and approved by the board, as well as with senior management’s assessment of the bank’s risk management capabilities.” According to the PRA’s second framework for crypto assets, which was released in 2022, firms still cannot completely mitigate the risks of using permissionless blockchains.

A report by venture capital firm Electric Capital found that 7,625 of 39,148 new developers this year headed to Solana, surpassing Ethereum, which onboarded 6,456 new developers. This marks the first time Solana has outpaced Ethereum in new developer adoption since 2016. The overall surge in new developers, up by 39% annually since Ethereum's 2015 launch, underscores the growing interest in blockchain innovation. Solana's rise to become the top choice for first-time developers reflects its user-friendly architecture, low transaction costs, and active community support, experts say.

Whales Acquire 590 Million Tokens appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, Ripple Labs’ native token, appears to be consolidating within a tight range for over a week. Amid this consolidation and the market uncertainty, crypto whales and long-term holders have shown strong interest in the altcoin, following the formation of a bullish price action pattern, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Santiment . Crypto Whales Add Over $1 Billion Worth of XRP Despite the price remaining in a tight range, data reveals that whales and long-term holders have seized this opportunity to significantly accumulate the tokens. Investors holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP tokens have reportedly accumulated an additional 590 million XRP, worth $1.29 billion. Furthermore, the data indicates that these whales collectively hold 8.91 billion XRP tokens. Source: Santiment These substantial accumulations of XRP tokens indicate the interest and confidence of long-term investors and crypto whales. This notable acquisition reduces selling pressure, hints at a potential upside rally, and suggests an ideal buying opportunity. However, despite these accumulations, the XRP price has remained neutral, with no major price changes observed, although it has formed a bullish pattern on its daily chart. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, XRP appears to be forming a bullish flag-and-pole price action pattern on the daily time frame and is currently struggling to breach this pattern. Based on the analysis, if XRP breaks out of this pattern and closes a daily candle above the $2.50 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 80% to reach the $4.50 level in the coming days. Source: Trading View On a positive note, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 62, which is below the overbought zone, indicating that the asset still has enough room to rally further. XRP price momentum At press time, XRP is trading near $2.41 and has experienced a price decline of 0.52% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume has increased by 5%, indicating rising participation from traders and investors amid XRP’s bullish outlook.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-buy-signal-whales-acquire-590-million-tokens/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37598316,https://crypto.news/?p=14319326,1734118292,Bank of England’s PRA asks firms to disclose crypto investments,"The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority has issued a data request asking firms to disclose their current and planned exposures to “cryptoassets.” The statement requested firms to disclose their current and expected future “cryptoasset exposures” and to explain their use of the crypto-regulating Basel framework. These assets encompass tokenized assets and stablecoins. Firms have until March 24, 2025, to submit their responses. The PRA emphasized that the information will inform its policymaking, including calibrating prudential frameworks for managing ‘cryptoasset’ exposures. This initiative aligns with the global Basel framework , which guides the prudential treatment of cryptoassets.

Back in July, the Bank for International Settlements partnered with the Bank of England on a pilot project called “Project Pyxtrial” to track stablecoins’ reserves. The project hoped to help regulators with near real-time data on stablecoins’ liabilities and backing assets, utilizing data collection, storage, and analysis technologies. Similarly, the current data collection request aims to analyze the costs and benefits of potential regulatory approaches and establish a baseline for monitoring developments in the sector, according to the statement. Not all firms are required to submit a response. The PRA clarified that only entities with relevant cryptoasset exposures or activities need to provide information. However, firms are asked to complete sections of the data template that apply to their operations. A “nil return” is not required from those without exposure.

This incident underscores the ongoing risks of phishing scams, which can affect multiple assets and remain undetected for extended periods. The user had purchased the device directly from Ledger, and the seed phrase was securely stored, highlighting that even with proper security measures, users can still fall victim to sophisticated phishing attacks.

37598225,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662199,1734118211,"Can Bitcoin Hit $160,000 In 2025? Matrixport Thinks So","Singapore-based crypto service provider Matrixport predicts that Bitcoin may reach as high as $160,000 by 2025. In a newly released report, titled Matrix on Target (Issue #2024-112), the firm outlines a scenario in which increased institutional adoption, macroeconomic evolution, and broadening global liquidity could push the leading cryptocurrency to unprecedented levels. Why Bitcoin Will Reach $160,000 In 2025 Matrixport’s research team notes that Bitcoin’s performance in 2024 exceeded multiple key price projections and validated their previous analytical frameworks. According to the report, this strength has been propelled by institutional investors who embraced the Bitcoin ETF market. These investors have “realized substantial gains, incentivizing further allocation as we move into 2025,” states Matrixport. The report highlights Bitcoin’s emergence as a portfolio component, underscoring that “our analysis recommends a 1.55% allocation to achieve optimal diversification while maintaining portfolio stability.” This approach reflects Bitcoin’s gradual integration into traditional investment strategies, as well as its evolving status as a macro-relevant asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $250,000, Ethereum To $12,000: Here’s When, Says VC CIO Looking ahead, Matrixport’s analysis emphasizes the approaching “8% adoption threshold” that could signal a turning point for Bitcoin. Drawing parallels to other technologies that experienced exponential growth once this threshold was crossed. “Historically, technologies that cross this mark, such as smartphones and social media, experience exponential growth driven by network effects and broader accessibility. As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, it is poised to transition from a niche asset to a core component of global financial markets,” the firm forecasts. Matrixport also details a shift in market dynamics. Historically, Bitcoin’s cycles were defined by steep 80% retracements, but this pattern may be diminishing. The firm reports “a growing base of dip buyers and institutional support,” which it says reduces the probability of severe corrective phases. While temporary consolidations remain a part of market structure, Matrixport anticipates these to be “less pronounced, reflecting Bitcoin’s maturation as an asset class.” Regarding specific price forecasts, Matrixport outlines a “+60% upside” as the market progresses into 2025, culminating in a $160,000 price target for Bitcoin. The report attributes this target to “sustained demand for Bitcoin ETFs,” supportive macroeconomic conditions, and an expansion in global liquidity. Related Reading: Australia’s Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First Matrixport’s proprietary Greed & Fear Index—a barometer for market sentiment—indicates stable conditions. The report claims that “the current consolidation phase may be shorter than previous ones,” with stabilized funding rates and normalized market conditions. In turn, the analysts see “the stage … set for renewed upward momentum.” Matrixport also calls attention to Bitcoin’s recent resilience, noting that “the swift recovery from recent overheated conditions” supports the notion that BTC price is well-positioned for another growth cycle. The overarching view remains optimistic. Matrixport concludes that “the outlook for 2025 remains bullish,” with Bitcoin’s track record as “an inflation hedge, and its integration into institutional portfolios suggest a transformative year ahead.” The firm concludes: “As adoption accelerates and the market matures, Bitcoin is positioned to achieve new all-time highs, further solidifying its role as a cornerstone of the global financial landscape.” At press time, BTC traded at $100,371.

In a tweet , Horsley stated that the adoption of cryptocurrencies is accelerating as traditional financial institutions integrate more crypto-savvy investors. He noted that the investment, made through one of the bank’s funds, marks a significant step toward mainstream crypto adoption. The name of the bank has not been disclosed yet. Bitwise Asset Management launched the first-ever Aptos staking exchange-traded product (ETP) on Switzerland’s SIX Exchange in November of this year. This investment vehicle is designed to deliver an expected return of 4.7% by staking Aptos’ APT tokens, providing investors with a regulated method to earn passive income through participation in blockchain activities. The launch of this product comes at a crucial period in the world of crypto investments, as Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETPs had been already introduced in the United States. Meanwhile, network activity on Aptos has been on an uptrend. Data compiled by Nansen, for instance, revealed that active addresses on the network hit 1.2 million this month. The newly released Electric Capital Developer Report 2024 also ranked Aptos as the second-fastest growing ecosystem in terms of overall developer activity. Comparing data from Q3 2023 to Q4 2024, Aptos experienced a whopping 96% growth in its developer community. Despite the recent developments, APT’s spot price has not experienced a significant uptick. In the past week, it saw a slight rise of 1.4%, trading at $14.19.While many other crypto assets have experienced significant rallies this month, APT only gained a little over 16% during the same period.

Near Protocol (NEAR) is showing a strong recovery after a recent correction, with analysts predicting more gains ahead. Meanwhile, XRP (Ripple) is causing quite the stir, with experts boldly claiming that XRP holders could become “filthy rich” thanks to its unique market position and ongoing adoption in global remittances. And then there’s Qubetics ($TICS) , an emerging powerhouse that’s turning heads with its presale success. With over $5.9M raised and 318 million tokens sold, Qubetics isn’t just another token—it’s redefining how crypto payments work. From eliminating volatility to integrating with Apple Pay, Qubetics is tackling real-life problems that its predecessors left unsolved. Let’s break down why these three are the best cryptos to buy in December 2024. Qubetics ($TICS): The Crypto Payment Revolution Qubetics isn’t playing around when it comes to innovation. Picture this: you’re running a small online store, and a customer in Europe wants to pay in XRP, while another in Asia prefers Bitcoin. Normally, this would be a nightmare of conversions, fees, and timing. But with Qubetics’ non-custodial multi-chain wallet , these payments are auto-converted into your local currency—fast, secure, and hassle-free. That’s not all. The Qubetics wallet integrates with Apple Pay and Google Pay, making crypto payments as simple as grabbing coffee with your phone . It’s designed for everyone, whether you’re using iOS, Android, or a desktop. For freelancers, gig workers, and global businesses, this is a game-changer. Let’s talk numbers. At $0.0311 per token, Qubetics is in Presale Phase 12. Prices increase 10% every week, with a final phase jump of 20%. With over 9,000 holders and an expected post-presale price of $0.25, early investors could see a 900% ROI. That’s insane growth potential, and it’s happening now. Qubetics doesn’t just simplify crypto—it makes it practical. Whether you’re a solo entrepreneur or managing a team, $TICS is setting the standard for what a modern financial tool should be. Near Protocol (NEAR): The Smart Contract Powerhouse Near Protocol is all about making blockchain accessible. Known for its user-friendly design and focus on scalability, NEAR is rapidly becoming a favorite among developers. It uses sharding technology to ensure the network can handle massive traffic without breaking a sweat—think of it as the blockchain version of a six-lane highway. After a recent pullback, NEAR is back on an uptrend, and investors are paying attention. Why? Because its ecosystem is expanding fast. From DeFi platforms to gaming and NFTs, NEAR is powering a wide range of applications. Plus, its low fees and lightning-fast transactions make it a solid choice for everyday use. What sets NEAR apart is its emphasis on user experience. Unlike many blockchains that require a steep learning curve, NEAR simplifies everything, even for first-time users. And with big-name partnerships and a growing community of developers, it’s clear that NEAR is here to stay. For anyone looking for one of the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, NEAR offers a mix of innovation, practicality, and growth potential. It might not have the hype of XRP or the crypto presale buzz of Qubetics, but it’s a project that’s quietly building a strong foundation for the future. XRP (Ripple): The Global Payments Leader XRP isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s a movement. Designed for cross-border payments, Ripple is tackling one of the biggest issues in global finance: slow, expensive international transfers. By replacing traditional banking systems with blockchain technology, XRP makes sending money across borders as easy as sending an email. Here’s why people are bullish on XRP: global adoption is growing. Banks, payment providers, and financial institutions are increasingly using RippleNet to streamline remittances. This isn’t just speculation; it’s real-world use. And with recent regulatory clarity, XRP is well-positioned to capitalize on its unique niche. Experts are making bold claims, saying XRP holders could become “filthy rich” as adoption increases. While that might sound like hyperbole, the fundamentals are strong. XRP’s speed, low cost, and scalability make it a top choice for institutions and individuals alike. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to buy in December 2024, XRP offers a mix of practicality and high growth potential. It’s not just a bet on crypto—it’s a bet on the future of money. Why Qubetics, Near Protocol, and XRP Are Must-Haves So, which crypto should you bet on? Honestly, why not all three? Qubetics ($TICS) is perfect for those looking to get in early on a project with massive ROI potential and real-world impact. Near Protocol (NEAR) offers innovation and scalability, making it a solid choice for long-term growth. And XRP is revolutionizing global payments, offering both practicality and huge upside. Based on the latest research, we recommend Qubetics ($TICS), Near Protocol (NEAR), and XRP (Ripple) as the best cryptos to buy in December 2024 . Don’t miss out—2025 could be the year these projects take off!

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

In a recent social media post , Hougan highlighted several milestones, including BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% portfolio allocation to Bitcoin and the record-breaking success of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). When bitcoin hits $1 million, investors are going to look back and wonder how they missed such obvious signs, including: >>The once-and-future President of the United States keynoting the Bitcoin Conference >> BlackRock recommending a 2% allocation to bitcoin in portfolios >>… — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) December 13, 2024 Trump, ETFs, and Institutional Recommendation Hougan underscored the importance of high-profile endorsements, mentioning comments from prominent investor Ray Dalio, who recently expressed support for owning Bitcoin. Such endorsements would contribute to increasing mainstream credibility for the asset. He pointed to the unprecedented performance of Bitcoin ETFs, which have surpassed previous records by a significant margin. This may indicate a substantial level of interest from institutional and retail investors alike. Another factor highlighted in Hougan’s post was D onald Trump’s participation as a keynote speaker at a major Bitcoin conference. This could be interpreted as a sign of Bitcoin’s growing political acceptance and integration into broader financial discussions. Florida Proposes to Establish Bitcoin Reserve Florida is considering the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve , with the initiative potentially launching in early 2025. Samuel Armes, President of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA), shared the proposal’s details, including using state pension funds and budget surplus for crypto investment. Armes highlighted that allocating just 1% of Florida’s $185.7 billion pension fund to Bitcoin could create a reserve worth approximately $1.857 billion. He noted that the state’s pension fund has already engaged in crypto-related investments through hedge funds, including stakes in companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy. Beyond the pension fund, Armes suggested allocating 1% of Florida’s $116.5 billion budget surplus, which would amount to $1.165 billion, toward the investment. He emphasized that this would further solidify Florida’s financial position while diversifying its investment portfolio. Armes also cited a favorable legislative environment in Florida and expressed optimism about the prospects of passing the necessary measures. He revealed plans to advocate for this initiative and three other Bitcoin-focused bills in the upcoming legislative session.

Significant bounce from APT on the higher timeframe support area. Expecting this one to continue to run upwards to $17 and $20, the latter is a primary target.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X APT is trading for $14.18 at time of writing, up 3% in the last 24 hours. Lastly, the trader says that Bitcoin ( BTC ) needs to hold $98,000 as support to remain in an uptrend. “Bitcoin looks ready to continue moving upwards. It needs to hold above $98,000 and then we’re good to go.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X Looking at his chart, the trader suggests that Bitcoin may soon hit $106,000.

37597391,https://finbold.com/?p=219429,1734116507,2 cryptocurrencies to reach a $50 billion market cap in 2025,"The cryptocurrency market in 2024 has been a year of contrasts, marked by significant milestones and lingering economic uncertainty. Bitcoin ( BTC ) shattered expectations by crossing the $100,000 mark for the first time, reigniting optimism in digital assets. Yet, the broader economic backdrop remains volatile, raising questions about inflationary pressures and the Federal Reserve’s next moves. As uncertainty clouds traditional markets, several altcoins are making significant strides, positioning themselves to achieve major market cap milestones as 2025 approaches, driven by strong fundamentals and growing adoption. Sui Network (SUI) Sui Network ( SUI ) is rapidly establishing itself as a strong player with high-growth potential, aiming to achieve a $50 billion market cap by 2025. Currently trading at $4.79 with a market cap of $14 billion, Sui would need a 257% increase in valuation to reach this ambitious milestone. While the target is steep, a combination of factors, including ecosystem expansion, strategic partnerships, and robust market activity, make it a realistic possibility. The network has consistently showcased robust growth, with its Total Value Locked (TVL) peaking at $1.84 billion in December and remaining above $1 billion since November, according to DefiLlama. Meanwhile, Sui’s decentralized exchange ( DEX ) activity has seen record volumes, surpassing $35 billion in cumulative trading, indicating strong liquidity and user engagement within the ecosystem. Sui’s strategic partnerships are another critical factor fueling its rise. Collaborations with major players like Franklin Templeton, Babylon Labs, and Lombard have enhanced its capabilities, including integrating Bitcoin liquidity and exploring programmable Bitcoin use cases. SUI market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The integration of wallets like Phantom and Backpack has further expanded its accessibility, drawing in more users and institutional interest. Technical analysts have likened Sui’s current price action to Solana’s ( SOL ) breakout in 2020-2021, which saw exponential growth, as Finbold reported . If Sui can replicate this pattern while leveraging its expanding utility and strong market activity, it could attract significant capital inflows. Combined with broader market dynamics and a growing ecosystem, Sui appears well-positioned to reach the $50 billion market cap milestone in 2025. Chainlink (LINK) Chainlink ( LINK ) is steadily solidifying its role as a critical infrastructure provider in the blockchain ecosystem, with recent developments fueling its potential to achieve a $50 billion market cap. Currently trading at $28.15 with a market cap of $17.64 billion, the token has seen growing interest from institutional players and significant ecosystem advancements, signaling robust growth potential. LINK was recently in the spotlight with Donald Trump backed World Liberty purchasing over $2 million worth of LINK at an average price of $24.20. This acquisition coincided with a notable 20% price increase, further highlighting the growing demand for the token. Moreover, Chainlink’s role as a provider of cross-chain solutions continues to expand, driving its adoption across various sectors. LINK market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap For instance, recent announcements revealed the integration of Chainlink’s CCIP by the Ronin Ecosystem, a major gaming blockchain. Additionally, Lista DAO, a liquid staking protocol, has upgraded Chainlink’s infrastructure, further solidifying its position as a critical player in decentralized finance. Furthermore, Chainlink’s influence extends into traditional finance. Notably, 21X, a fintech firm in Europe, has integrated Chainlink’s infrastructure to support tokenized securities. This move strengthens its relevance in some of the world’s most tightly regulated financial markets. With its increasing utility, strategic partnerships, and rising market demand, Chainlink is well-positioned to capture significant value. As a result, it offers traders and investors a compelling case for its journey toward a $50 billion market cap. That being said, both Sui and Link are well-positioned to potentially reach the $50 billion market cap milestone, driven by ecosystem growth, emerging partnerships, and increasing adoption. However, the volatility of the cryptocurrency market calls for cautious investment, with traders and investors needing to monitor trends and developments closely.

Between December 10 and 12th, 2024, Riot has made a significant purchase of 5,117 Bitcoins for $510m. This major acquisition has brought up the company’s total holdings to 16,728. Top BTC accumulators are reaping the benefits of the price rise after the asset hit $100k. Riot Platforms purchased BTC at almost the market peak Riot Platforms ’ substantial purchase of 5,117 BTC reportedly averaged $99,669. It highlights the company’s strategic approach to capitalizing and monopolizing market trends. The company successfully managed to position itself to potentially benefit from further price rise of the top crypto by market cap. Purchasing BTC is not an uncommon practice amongst the several Bitcoin mining companies as they utilize a segment of their mined Bitcoin for long-term investments. Bitcoin mining company Riot Platforms announced that it purchased approximately 5,117 bitcoins at an average price of $99,669 between December 10 and December 12, 2024, with a total cost of approximately $510 million. As of December 12, 2024, Riot Platforms' total bitcoin… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) December 13, 2024 On December 10, BTC’s price rise became evident as it inched towards the record high of $100k. It consistently rose through the level in the next two days. BTC has maintained this psychological level at press time. According to the SEC filing dated December 9, Riot raised $525 million through a debt offering for the purchase. The company issued “senior notes,” which are loans from investors that can be converted into Riot’s stock under specific conditions. These notes will need to be repaid by 2030 and come with a low interest rate of 0.75%. Riot Platform’s consistent crypto acquisition has led its balance to surpass 12,000 BTC. As per Arkham Research , Riot has a portfolio value of $1.2 billion. Riot’s BTC balance history | Source: Arkham Research Bitcoin purchases have seen a rise in shareholder value while providing a competitive edge in the dynamic Bitcoin industry. Crypto players enjoy high BTC value against cost Bitcoin accumulation by Riot Platforms and other businesses is bearing fruits as the asset continues a bull run. Over the last year, the amount of Bitcoin held by well-known companies like Tesla, Coinbase Global, Marathon Digital Holdings, MicroStrategy, and others has risen dramatically. MicroStrategy, for instance, holds the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury, which stands at a staggering 423,650 BTC. As per data by Bitcoin Treasuries , MSTR is enjoying around 1.68x returns on its BTC bet. The market return against cost is substantial. So far, the holdings have attracted significant attention. It is clear that the companies see Bitcoin as a long-term investment advocating dollar-cost averaging. BTC is now 42% of the company’s total market cap at the time of writing. Mining company, Marathon Digital Holdings, follows next in line. While MicroStrategy is a key listed player in BTC accumulation, Marathon has reportedly amassed 40,435 Bitcoin. BTC is 51% of the market cap of Marathon as of Friday. Meanwhile, Riot is placed third on the list with around 38% of its market cap dominated by Bitcoin. Tesla is next and it reportedly holds 9,720 Bitcoin, enjoying a 2.93x return on its purchases. If you recall, Tesla’s initial Bitcoin investment elicited mixed reactions, but the company has made money. Among other businesses, Coinbase Global is the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform in the US. It is next on the list of top BTC purchasers already listed. The exchange holds 9,480 Bitcoin, enjoying a massive 8.24x return. Riot Platforms’ recent Bitcoin purchase underlines the continued interest among individual investors and companies alike. As the highly volatile crypto market continues to expand and evolve, Bitcoin’s $100k mark is being considered a sign of maturity. All the major players and newly established businesses will likely start following suit. Despite being subject to market risk, several businesses incorporate strategies into their portfolio in the drive to get exceptional returns. And Bitcoin remains the latest bet.

Speaking with CNBC on Thursday , Morehead compared the development of blockchain technology to historical financial innovations and expressed some serious optimism about the crypto and blockchain space — especially as more and more institutions expose themselves to it. “Presently, most institutions really have almost zero exposure to blockchain, so once they start engaging in the space, it should do well,” he said. Morehead cited regulatory uncertainty as a key hurdle for institutional adoption, pointing to ongoing legal actions involving major crypto firms. These developments, he noted, have created hesitation among pension funds, endowments, and other large investors. He called for clearer regulatory guidelines to facilitate broader institutional participation in the market. You might also like: What is Hedera Hashgraph? HBAR crypto explained Bitcoin is better than gold One of Morehead’s bold claims was that Bitcoin ( BTC ) outperforms gold as a reserve asset. Highlighting the U.S. government’s current gold reserves, he argued that Bitcoin offers a more efficient alternative for national reserves. According to Morehead, the U.S. already owns 1% of the world’s Bitcoins, and it would be great for the U.S. to take the lead in Bitcoin holding “Go to digital gold, Bitcoin, it’s much better,” he said. He also expressed optimism about the long-term trajectory of cryptocurrency markets, noting that Bitcoin’s price performance has consistently doubled annually over the past decade. “Bitcoin has more than doubled this year… but that’s not unusual,” he said Morehead suggested that 2025 could be a pivotal year for crypto, with regulatory clarity expected to unlock significant institutional interest. He also sees stablecoins as an area poised for growth. While some major corporations remain hesitant to add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, Morehead believes insurance companies, pension funds, and endowments will drive the next phase of market expansion. With clearer rules, he argued, institutions will increasingly view blockchain as a viable asset class.

On December 11, 2024, the Cardano coin gained over 8%, enabling it to start recovering from a 23% drop recorded the previous day.

Hill emphasized the need for clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, criticizing the previous approach under SEC Chairman Gensler as 'regulation by enforcement.' He aims to introduce two key pieces of legislation within the first 100 days of the Trump administration: a Market Structure Bill for Digital Assets and a Stablecoin Bill. These initiatives are expected to unlock innovation, facilitate banking relationships, and encourage new capital inflows into the cryptocurrency sector, according to Coinbase CFO Alesia Haas.

37597028,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319413,1734115208,Rep. French Hill Outlines Pro-Crypto Agenda as New House Financial Services Chair,"Rep. French Hill, a pro-crypto candidate, was elected as the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee on December 13, giving him considerable influence over banking and financial regulations in the United States. In a recent interview with CNBC, Rep. Hill highlighted his top three priorities as he assumes the role. Hill outlined three main goals: reforming the financial landscape, fostering innovation, and addressing challenges in the banking and digital asset sectors. From Banks to Blockchain: Rep. French Hill’s Pro-Crypto Agenda He emphasized the need to reduce regulatory burdens that make it difficult for banks to achieve profitability and attract capital. RECENTLY: Incoming House Financial Services Chairman, Rep. French Hill, emphasized the need for a structured market in the cryptocurrency sector. Here's what he said: ""We need a market structure for digital assets. We don't have rules of the road. Under chairman Gensler, we… pic.twitter.com/rGa55ZFgOJ — Rowen Exchange (@RowenExchange) December 13, 2024 Hill noted that overregulation has stifled smaller banks and driven consolidation in the industry, favoring larger financial institutions. He advocated for tailored regulatory approaches to serve banks of all sizes better and ensure they remain profitable, safe, and capable of meeting customer needs. Secondly, Hill addressed the challenges facing capital formation in public markets. He highlighted the shrinking number of publicly traded companies in the U.S., attributing this trend to the high costs and complexities of going public. Hill expressed concerns that the current environment discourages small entrepreneurs and limits investment opportunities for families, pension plans, and 401(k)s. He called for reforms to make it easier and more affordable for companies to go public and remain publicly traded. Hill’s third focus is establishing a clear digital asset regulatory framework. He criticized the current “regulation by enforcement” approach under SEC Chair Gary Gensler , arguing that it hinders innovation in blockchain technology and Web3 applications. Hill also emphasized the importance of creating rules that foster technological advancement and ensure the U.S. remains competitive in digital assets. He expressed support for legislation establishing a dollar-backed stablecoin under U.S. law, a priority for the Republican majority in the House. What Hill’s Leadership Means for Crypto Regulation and Stablecoins in 2025 Hill is known for supporting digital assets. He previously chaired the committee’s digital assets subcommittee and succeeded Patrick McHenry, a long-time crypto advocate who retired in 2023. Hill’s leadership signals the start of a truly pro-crypto shift under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. Trump has nominated key crypto proponents, including Paul Atkins , to oversee the SEC and David Sacks as the White House’s “crypto czar.” Hill expressed optimism about advancing crypto regulation and stablecoin bills in Congress, with efforts likely to ramp up in 2025. Hill has also emphasized fintech’s role in enhancing small banks’ competitiveness through AI tools for customer service and compliance. He advocates a balanced regulatory approach that fosters collaboration between fintech and traditional banks, ensuring financial system safety. Additionally, Hill dismissed concerns about the U.S. having too many banks and viewed it as improving banking access in underserved rural areas. The post Rep.

37596985,https://thecoinrise.com/coinbase-europe-delists-major-stablecoins-to-comply-with-mica/,1734115208,Coinbase Europe Delists Major Stablecoins to Comply With MiCA,"In a significant shift, Coinbase Europe has announced that it will be delisting several stablecoins from its platform. This move complies with the European Union’s new Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. This decision, which affects prominent stablecoins like Tether’s USDT, has sent ripples through the crypto community. This signals the growing influence of EU regulations on the global crypto landscape. Coinbase Takes a Stand on MiCA Regulatory Compliance In a message to its European users, Coinbase stated that it is implementing restrictions for stablecoins that fail to meet the MiCA requirements. The new regulations aim to bring structure and security to the crypto market by enforcing strict rules on all crypto assets. Stablecoins, in particular, are subject to these stringent requirements. As a result, any stablecoin that is not compliant with these regulations will face restrictions. Starting December 13, users in Coinbase Europe and Coinbase Germany will no longer be able to trade or hold several popular stablecoins. These include Tether’s USDT , Paxos Standard’s PAX, PayPal USD (PYUSD), Gemini Dollar’s GUSD, GYEN, the Japanese YEN stablecoin by GMO-Z.com, and DAI, the stablecoin from Maker Protocol. The platform has given its users the ability to sell, convert, or transfer these assets out of the exchange until the restriction date. What This Means for Coinbase Users Coinbase has reassured its users that the delisting is temporary. The platform has made it clear that it will reassess the situation. Also, it could re-enable services for stablecoins that meet MiCA compliance in the future. However, for now, users of Coinbase Europe are left with limited options. This is because only USDC, a stablecoin co-created by Coinbase and Circle, and EURC, Euro Coin are MiCA-compliant and will remain available. Coinbase urges users to act quickly before the deadline to avoid losing access to these assets. Tether Responds to the Regulatory Pressure Tether, the issuer of USDT, has expressed concerns about Europe’s evolving regulations. However, it stressed that it remains committed to the European market. While it recognizes some benefits of the new MiCA regulations, Tether worries that they could create new risks. The company also hinted at a disagreement with exchanges that may be taking premature actions to comply with MiCA. The firm mentioned that it was possibly because they acted out of self-interest or misunderstanding the situation. Meanwhile, Tether did not directly reference Coinbase in its statement. The timing of its statement suggested it might be reacting to Coinbase’s decision to delist USDT. This tension is amplified by the fact that USDC will continue to be supported on the platform. Notably, Some European countries struggle to update their laws to match the new MiCA rules . Recently, many have requested a six-month grace period after the year-end deadline.

37596593,https://blockworks.co/news/cosmos-ecosystem-changes-after-skip-acquisition,1734114447,What changes for Cosmos after Skip acquisition?,"The Cosmos ecosystem is entering a new chapter with the Interchain Foundation’s (ICF) acquisition of Skip and the establishment of Interchain Inc. The move represents a pivot from the ICF’s historical funding of disparate teams toward a more centralized and cohesive approach. The new subsidiary, led by Skip co-founders Barry Plunkett and Maghnus Mareneck, will take charge of product development, ecosystem strategy and execution, the ICF announced earlier this week. On Thursday, a “community town hall” X space shed additional light on what to expect in 2025. A unified stack Cosmos has long been heralded for its modular technology stack, including Cosmos SDK, IBC, CometBFT, and CosmWasm. However, Plunkett described a lack of coordination in the ecosystem’s growth. “There wasn’t any cohesive overarching connection,” Plunkett told Blockworks. “Each of them was going off in their own direction.” Read more: Uniting the blockchain ecosystems: Q&A with Cosmos founder Ethan Buchman Interchain Inc. aims to bridge these silos, including major “version 2” upgrades to both IBC — known as Eureka — and the Cosmos SDK. The SDK upgrade promises a 10–25x performance boost, while IBC Eureka simplifies the Interchain interop protocol to enable faster integration with non-Cosmos chains like Ethereum, EVM rollups and Solana. “It’s a massive simplification of the IBC protocol that’s really going to allow the ecosystem to connect to other chains beyond [Cosmos]…in days or weeks,” Plunkett said during the X space. In other words, Eureka “is like if ‘IBC Classic’ and Hyperlane had a baby,” as Cosmos-veteran builder Zaki Manian put it on the latest edition of the Bell Curve podcast . Another cornerstone of the new strategy is expanding virtual machine (VM) support. An open-source EVM is in the works, with the team in discussions with projects like Injective and Cronos to consider adapting their EVM implementations. “Most Cosmos chains want a simple, reliable and free path to add EVM functionality,” Plunkett said, emphasizing that Solidity contracts will be able to interact seamlessly with Cosmos SDK modules and vice versa. Cosmos chains will also gain the flexibility to run any VM. “Users shouldn’t have to say, ‘If I’m going to build a Cosmos chain, then I can’t use whatever VM I want,’” Plunkett added. The role of the Cosmos Hub Addressing liquidity fragmentation across chains is a major priority for the Interchain Inc. team. Cosmos’ architecture, which empowers individual chains to operate independently, has inadvertently led to isolated liquidity pools. This hurts the overall ecosystem and discourages developers. Read more: Unified Ethereum? Devcon panelists take on fragmentation challenges Liquidity gets stuck on one chain and isn’t accessible from other chains, Mareneck said on X, adding, “One of the things we want to do is really unite that liquidity so that it’s more accessible from more applications, so we can use the full weight of Cosmos liquidity.” The Cosmos Hub is central to this strategy. By providing liquidity services and reducing friction for developers, the Hub could position itself as the ecosystem’s growth engine. Permissionless Interchain Security (ICS) will make it easier for projects to onboard to the Hub. Whereas initially chains had to apply to Hub governance to make use of ICS, that’s no longer the case. Interchain Inc. is also focused on simplifying the developer experience, ensuring the Cosmos Hub provides essential services. “We need to make it easier for builders and ensure the Hub provides services to grow and scale chains,” Plunkett said. Read more: Solana gained highest share of new devs in 2024: Electric Capital The Skip team’s reputation for collaboration is going to be key for realizing this new Hub vision. “We have relationships at Skip with a lot of different projects…we want to continue to do that, working from the platform of the Cosmos Hub,” Mareneck said. Skip has focused on providing services for builders and useful products for users, such as Skip Go, which now powers over half of all IBC volume, Plunkett said on Bell Curve. Rather than enforcing participation, the team will offer “carrots, not sticks,” to align incentives and foster growth. By consolidating development and focusing on liquidity and accessibility, the ICF hopes to create a more unified and dynamic ecosystem, reigniting the vision of Cosmos as the “Internet of Blockchains.” Outgoing ICF board member Ethan Buchman, a co-founder of Cosmos, sees this move as a chance to reinvigorate the ecosystem and bring fragmented pieces together. “We’ve been struggling with the organizational challenges and fragmentation,” Buchman told Blockworks. This is really the first time I think we’ve taken a kind of revolutionary step to address that.” “It’s like I’ve been trying to put together the pieces of Humpty Dumpty for so many years and finally, we just went and recruited Batman,” he said.

37596147,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392973,1734114101,"VanEck’s Crypto Predictions for 2025: Bull Market, Bitcoin Reserves, AI Agents, and More","The post VanEck’s Crypto Predictions for 2025: Bull Market, Bitcoin Reserves, AI Agents, and More appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a latest blog post , VanEck has outlined its top 10 crypto predictions for 2025. VanEck predicts the Crypto bull market to hit a medium-term peak in Q1 and set new highs in Q4. It believes that the crypto bull market will persist through 2025, reaching its first peak in the first quarter. It projects Bitcoin to be valued at around $180,000, with Ethereum trading above $6,000, while Solana and Sui could exceed $500 and $10, respectively. Following this first peak, it anticipates a 30% retracement in BTC, with altcoins facing sharper declines of up to 60% as the market consolidates during the summer. However, it noted that a recovery is likely in the fall, with major tokens regaining momentum and reclaiming previous all-time highs by the end of the year. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Going further, it predicts that the U.S. embraces bitcoin with strategic reserves and foresees increased crypto adoption. VanEck predicts that by 2025, either the federal government or at least one U.S. state, likely Pennsylvania, Florida, or Texas will establish a Bitcoin reserve. With new SEC leadership, multiple new spot crypto ETPs will be approved. Ethereum ETPs will include staking, while both Ethereum and Bitcoin ETPs will allow in-kind transactions and redemptions. Tokenised Securities To Exceed $50B Its third prediction is that the value of tokenized securities exceeds $50 billion. VanEck thinks that 2025 will be a breakthrough year for tokenized securities to launch on open-source blockchains as entities like DTCC explore bridging public and private blockchains. Next, it noted that stablecoins are poised to revolutionize payments, with daily settlement volumes projected to reach $300 billion by the end of 2025, tripling from the current $100 billion per day. 1 Million AI Agents Could Emerge! One of the most compelling narratives VanEck believes will translate into massive traction in 2025 is AI Agents. It predicts that 1 million new AI agents will emerge. These agents generated significant revenues in the last month of 2024, and their onchain activity is projected to skyrocket as they expand beyond DeFi into social media, gaming, and consumer applications in 2025. VanEck predicts Bitcoin Layer-2s will reach 100,000 BTC in total value locked, building on the explosive 600% growth in 2024. Further, it foresees Ethereum blob space generates $1 billion in fees driven by explosive Layer-2 adoption, rollup optimizations, and high-fee use cases like tokenized assets and enterprise applications. Defi To Hit ATHs, NFT Trading Volumes To Rebound It foresees DeFi hitting all-time highs with $4 trillion DEX volumes and $200 billion total value locked, fueled by AI-related tokens, consumer-facing dApps, and tokenized assets driving liquidity and adoption. NFT trading volumes are projected to rebound to $30 billion in 2025. Despite the downturn over the past years, it noted that standout projects have defied the trend, leveraging strong community bonds. Finally, it foresees that DApp tokens narrow the performance gap with L1 tokens. In 2024, Layer-1 blockchain tokens outperformed dApp tokens by 2x, but the launch of innovative dApps in AI and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) is expected to drive a performance shift.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/vanecks-crypto-predictions-for-2025-bull-market-bitcoin-reserves-ai-agents-and-more/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Starting Dec. 13, Coinbase Europe will delist a basket of stablecoin tokens, including crypto’s largest fiat-pegged currency, Tether ( USDT ), to comply with broader rules enshrined in the Markets in Crypto-Assets framework. Coinbase will also prohibit trading for stablecoins like PAX, PYUSD, GUSD, GYEN, and Maker’s DAI, which were categorized as MiCA noncompliant tokens. Notably, the crypto exchange will continue trading support for Circle stablecoins ( USDC ) and EURC. Circle previously secured a European stablecoin license, the first of its kind under new MiCA laws. Coinbase added that Tether and other delisted stable tokens may be relisted later, provided they achieve MiCA compliance. At press time, Tether had not publicly addressed the delisting notice. Request for commentary sent by crypto.news was also unanswered as of reporting. https://twitter.com/AlgoFoundation/status/1866864413858234730 You might also like: Tether CEO warns MiCA stablecoin rules could pose ‘systemic risks’ to EU banks Observers have discussed Tether’s European fate for months, as MiCA was scheduled to go into full effect at the end of December.

Ardoino did assert that MiCA may have put stablecoins at risk back in August. Tether is the largest stablecoin operator by a fair margin, boasting a $140 billion market cap and circulating supply. While the EU is a major economic area, most of Tether’s business caters to emerging markets like Latin America and Southeast Asia. The company also pocketed billions in record profits during the year, investing in Bitcoin ( BTC ), mining facilities, and data centers. Additionally, Tether’s U.S. Treasury Bill holdings could position the startup as a major beneficiary of American stablecoin policies.

Is it the massive returns, the thriving communities, or the simple joy of joining a playful yet profitable movement? December 2024 brings us three exciting meme coins to watch: BTFD Coin ($BTFD) , with its impressive $3.7 million presale; Dogwifhat ($WIF), primed for a potential bull run following significant whale activity; and Cheems ($CHEEMS), which, despite its dip, is setting up for a possible recovery in the near future. As meme coins continue to captivate investors, they’ve evolved into a phenomenon that’s about more than just internet humour. From staking rewards to governance and real-world impact, meme coins are blending utility with entertainment. Among the crowd, BTFD Coin’s meteoric rise and Dogwifhat’s and Cheems’ unique market dynamics make them the best meme coins to buy in December 2024 . BTFD Coin: A $3.7M Presale That’s Breaking Records What’s all the buzz about BTFD Coin? Well, for starters, it’s smashing presale records like nobody’s business. With $3.7 million raised so far and over 53 billion tokens sold, BTFD Coin is becoming the talk of the crypto town. It’s no surprise that over 5,000 investors, affectionately called “bulls,” have already joined the movement, making BTFD one of the fastest-growing meme coins of 2024. Here’s the kicker: this presale isn’t just about numbers; it’s about serious potential. If you’ve got $20,000 to invest in Stage 12, you’d scoop up a jaw-dropping 153.84 million $BTFD tokens. And when the coin hits its launch price of $0.0006, your investment could grow to an incredible $92,308. That’s a staggering 361% ROI before the coin even hits the public market. But wait, there’s more. BTFD isn’t just riding the meme coin hype—it’s building an ecosystem that investors can believe in. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already in beta, the project is laying the groundwork for a vibrant gaming community. Add in staking rewards of up to 90% APY, and you’ve got a recipe for both short-term excitement and long-term growth. And let’s not forget the ethos that sets BTFD apart: “buy the dip.” It’s more than a catchphrase; it’s a rallying cry for a generation of savvy investors looking to own the dip and ride the bulls. With only four presale stages left and momentum building every day, this is your chance to get in on the action before prices soar for one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024. Dogwifhat: A Meme Coin Ready for a Bull Run Dogwifhat ($WIF) has been a standout performer in 2024, boasting an eye-popping 1,743.02% gain over the past year. While its price recently dipped to $2.92, analysts believe a bull run could be imminent, fuelled by strong whale activity. A $3 million transfer to Coinbase has sparked renewed interest in WIF, with speculation about another surge gaining traction. Despite short-term price fluctuations, Dogwifhat’s community and its innovative use of the Solana blockchain make it a compelling choice for investors looking to ride the next wave. Dogwifhat isn’t just about price action; it’s about engagement. The coin thrives on social media hype, creating a culture of humour and inclusivity that resonates with its audience. With predictions suggesting a possible dip to $2.16 before rebounding, WIF offers both a buying opportunity and the potential for significant upside as we approach 2025. For those looking to bet on a meme coin with strong fundamentals and a community-driven ethos, Dogwifhat is a name to watch. Cheems: The Original Meme Coin Eyes a Recovery Cheems ($CHEEMS), one of the first memecoins on the Solana blockchain, is a testament to the staying power of internet culture. Despite a 54% dip in the past month, Cheems’ rich history and vibrant community suggest that a recovery could be on the horizon. What makes Cheems unique is its cultural relevance. Born from the world-famous Cheems meme, the coin represents more than just a digital asset—it’s a celebration of internet humour and creativity. Even as its price struggles, the coin’s enduring popularity and active community are key indicators of its long-term potential. Technically, Cheems is nearing oversold territory, with analysts predicting a potential rebound as market sentiment improves. With a price of $0.0006008, the current dip could be an attractive entry point for investors looking to capitalise on its eventual turnaround. For those who believe in the resilience of the meme coin market, Cheems offers a unique opportunity to invest in a token with deep cultural roots and a history of defying the odds. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Dogwifhat, and Cheems stand out as the top best meme coins to buy in December 2024. BTFD’s explosive presale success and potential for massive ROI make it one of the must-have meme coins for investors. Dogwifhat’s whale activity and community-driven momentum position it for a possible bull run, while Cheems’ cultural relevance and recovery potential offer a unique entry point for those who love a good comeback story. If you’re ready to join the meme coin revolution, don’t wait. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and secure your place in one of the most exciting crypto opportunities of the year.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-gold-elongold-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-underperform/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The company, in collaboration with Fireblocks, one of the well-known crypto infrastructure providers, intends to launch a euro-denominated stablecoin next year. This move is part of the group’s larger initiative to extend the use cases of digital euros, in line with the European Union’s new regulatory framework for digital assets. Stablecoins, characterized by their low volatility, have become increasingly popular among crypto traders and institutional investors, making this a strategic entry point for Oddo. Growing Competition in Europe’s Stablecoin Market Oddo’s move is reflective of broader momentum in Europe’s financial landscape as demand for stablecoins soars. This follows the launching by Societe Generale SA of its euro-pegged stablecoin, EUR, issued under EU regulatory guidelines. Strong competition already characterizes the European market, with big players such as Tether’s USDT, Centre’s USDC, and PayPal’s PYUSD already leading the charge in the global market. Other companies that have also shown interest in offering stablecoin solutions include Robinhood Markets and Revolut. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank has teamed up with Galaxy Digital to create AllUnity, a platform that will issue euro-denominated stablecoins among its suite of digital finance services. Oddo’s move just underscores how much more central stablecoins are becoming to Europe’s new financial landscape. Fireblocks: Powering Digital Asset Operations Fireblocks, Oddo’s technology partner of choice, is integral to this effort. With its reputation for secure wallet infrastructure and deep operational tools, Fireblocks supports more than 60 blockchain networks, making it a natural fit for integrating and managing stablecoin transactions. The platform’s capabilities go beyond security; it streamlines digital asset settlements , enabling institutions like Oddo to efficiently manage transactions while ensuring compliance with EU regulations. This positions Oddo for effective competition in a market characterized by rapid technological changes and strict regulatory oversight. The market for stablecoins continues to grow, meaning Oddo BHF’s move with Fireblocks may pave the way for greater mainstream use of digital euros in Europe, another step into blockchain for traditional finance.",POSITIVE,USDT,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION | USDT,,0,0,BTC Pulse,https://btc-pulse.com/oddo-bhf-partners-with-fireblocks-stablecoin-market/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png

Despite the cryptocurrency’s recent rise and increasing institutional interest, Payne argued that Bitcoin’s volatile history and speculative nature could lead to an inevitable collapse, likening the scenario to the 2008 housing bubble. Bitcoin has experienced significant price swings over the years, with Payne pointing to historical declines of over 60% to 70% on multiple occasions. “If you’re running a business and holding cash in Bitcoin, that’s crazy,” Payne said, criticizing BTC as an unreliable store of value. Payne’s comments extended to MicroStrategy, a company heavily invested in Bitcoin. Shares of MicroStrategy have risen nearly 500% this year, largely driven by its $4 billion Bitcoin holdings. But Payne called the strategy risky and unsustainable, stressing that the company’s current valuation of around $90 billion is a far cry from its modest $500 million revenue generation. Related News: BREAKING: Developers of This Altcoin Sue Coinbase Over Delist Decision In comparison, Payne said a company like Enbridge Inc., with $50 billion in annual revenue and a 6% dividend yield, offers a much more stable and profitable investment. In contrast, MicroStrategy’s business model seems entirely dependent on Bitcoin’s price continuing to rise, which Payne describes as a “house of cards.” Asked if he would consider investing in Bitcoin during the current rally, Payne was adamant: “I don’t own Bitcoin and I’m not going to own it here. At some point, it’s going to crash.” He compared the situation to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, when excessive leverage in the real estate market led to a dramatic decline as prices stopped climbing. He suggested that MicroStrategy could face a tough year if Bitcoin’s value declines. “This wouldn’t be their first crash,” Payne said, referring to the company’s troubles during the dot-com bubble. *This is not investment advice.

Bonk (BONK) is now the leading Solana meme by market capitalization, after flipping Dogwifhat (WIF). Solana meme tokens are rearranging their influence. Bonk (BONK) flipped DogWifHat (WIF), reaching a total market cap of $2.99B. BONK is a relatively early mass-appeal meme, while WIF tapped its community for long-term holding. Both memes have gone through drawdowns of up to 70%, with both retail and whale activity. Meme tokens as a whole retained a total market capitalization of over $120B after a recent correction. Solana’s top assets make up about 10% of that market, with some fluctuation in the top 20 tokens. While Solana makes up to 80% of new token launches, only a handful of top tokens compete with the earlier batch of Ethereum-based memes. Solana meme traders have also shifted their profile in the past few weeks. There are fewer new traders and smaller weekly cohorts, with lowered DEX activity. The bulk of transactions come from repeat traders, experienced in the Solana ecosystem. Overall, Solana memes are trying to grab the spotlight from the earlier Ethereum-based dog-themed tokens. The Solana network carries five tokens with a market capitalization above $1B, a threshold of increased visibility. Most of the up-and-coming Solana tokens are hovering around $500M while waiting for a breakout. Solana DEX activity slowed down in the past few days, as seen by lowered fees for Raydium and JitoSOL. The Solana meme craze is now being replaced by a rollover to DeFi and Ethereum-based projects. Despite this, meme tokens are still highly active, offering short-term opportunities for outsized rallies. SOL also took a step back, trading at $221.69, after attention moved to BTC and other narratives. AI agent tokens boost Solana’s trades The recent attention on Solana assets comes from meme tokens linked to AI agents. Those assets are the most active ones. The top Solana assets in the past week include WIF, POPCAT, Luigi, BONK, Chillguy, FARTCOIN, and GOAT. AI agents extended their top position among the most mentioned topics in crypto, starting from the end of November. The trend may continue into 2025, as predicted by experts from the real a16Z. In total, the AI agent market expanded above a valuation of $10B, of which AI16Z made gains at around $1B in market capitalization. The AI16Z token rallied after MEXC prepared to list it in its Assessment zone, starting to trade this Friday. 🚨 #MEXC New Listing Alert! 📈 #AI16Z /USDT will be listed in the Assessment Zone on 2024-12-13 03:40 (UTC). @ai16zdao is the first venture capital firm led by Al agents. — MEXC (@MEXC_Official) December 13, 2024 AI agent meme tokens are one of the recent trends on Solana, which partially overlaps with general AI on-chain startups. The trend was started by Truth Terminal and the Numogram (GNON) bot, later spawning multiple social media profiles. Not all AI agent tokens are made equal, and some are abused by minor token projects for extra visibility. One of the AI-driven tokens to rally was FARTCOIN, a ticker selected almost as a joke. The token rallied to an all-time high of $0.76, driven by social media hype. The asset is not connected to any specific AI agent on social media but is considered a part of the AI agent narrative.

The ranking of AI agents on social media also coincides with their token performance.

37596150,https://blog.bitfinex.com/?p=24550,1734113006,Why Companies Are Exploring Bitcoin Treasuries?,"The growing adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset represents a fundamental shift in global finance, with companies leveraging it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Following in the footsteps of MicroStrategy, this trend has gained traction across industries and regions, with notable examples including Tesla, Tether Holdings, and international players like India’s Jetking Infotrain and Japan’s Metaplanet. While Bitcoin’s deflationary properties and potential for capital appreciation make it an attractive option for innovation-driven firms, challenges such as regulatory uncertainty, price volatility, and environmental concerns demand careful risk management. This evolving corporate strategy underscores Bitcoin’s transition from a speculative asset to a recognized tool in treasury management, raising broader questions about its future role in reshaping global financial practices. The World’s Largest Companies are Now Taking Bitcoin Seriously The global corporate landscape is witnessing a notable shift as companies across regions are exploring and adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies, inspired by pioneers like MicroStrategy. This trend reflects a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a hedge against inflation and a store of value amidst economic turmoil or “black swan” events. Examples include shareholder proposals in multinational giants like Microsoft and Amazon , pushing these corporations to assess Bitcoin as a viable addition to their balance sheets. While Microsoft shareholders recently voted against such a proposal, citing concerns over volatility, the increasing advocacy signals a broader discussion on Bitcoin’s role in corporate financial strategies. The trend is not limited to the West; companies in countries such as Japan and India are also beginning to accumulate Bitcoin for their treasuries. In India, Jetking Infotrain recently made headlines by becoming the first publicly listed Indian firm to designate Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve. This move is seen as a bold step toward embracing digital assets as a central component of corporate finance, potentially influencing other firms in the region to follow suit. Such developments indicate that Bitcoin’s appeal as a treasury asset transcends borders, fueled by its deflationary traits and limited supply. In Japan, forward-thinking companies are also incorporating Bitcoin into their financial strategies, leveraging its ability to preserve value in a fluctuating economic environment. The most prominent, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet , often referred to as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” recently increased its Bitcoin treasury to 639.5 BTC, worth $40.5 million, with a second accumulation, totaling over 215 BTC and demonstrating its aggressive strategy to adopt Bitcoin as a core reserve asset. These moves highlight the growing global adoption of Bitcoin beyond speculative use cases, positioning it as a legitimate asset in corporate financial management. This adoption marks a significant milestone in Bitcoin’s maturation as a global financial instrument, especially in economies known for conservative fiscal approaches. As more companies integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets, the debate over its efficacy continues to intensify. Shareholders and executives weigh the potential benefits of diversification and inflation hedging against concerns about price volatility and regulatory uncertainty. This global corporate experiment with Bitcoin treasuries not only demonstrates its evolving role in modern finance but also sets the stage for further discussions on how digital assets can redefine traditional corporate treasury strategies. What Kinds of Companies Have Bitcoin Treasuries? According to BitcoinTreasuries.net , public and private companies globally have increasingly turned to Bitcoin as a treasury asset, with several well-known names leading the charge. MicroStrategy stands at the forefront of this trend, boasting the largest corporate Bitcoin treasury with over 423,650 BTC valued at approximately $42.7 billion. Under the leadership of Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s bold Bitcoin acquisition strategy has made it synonymous with corporate Bitcoin adoption, setting an example for other firms worldwide. Notably, this approach has resulted in significant stock market appreciation for the company, amplifying its influence as a trailblazer in the Bitcoin treasury movement. Tesla, though better known for its electric vehicles and clean energy solutions, has also made a notable mark in the Bitcoin treasury space. The company, led by Elon Musk, holds 9,720 BTC valued at nearly $979 million. While Tesla’s focus on Bitcoin has been more subdued compared to MicroStrategy, its entry into the space has sparked widespread discussion about the role of Bitcoin in diversifying corporate reserves. Tesla’s Bitcoin holdings are seen as part of its broader commitment to financial innovation and its support for digital currencies. Among privately-held companies, Block.one, the company behind the EOS blockchain, holds a staggering 164,000 BTC valued at $16.5 billion, making it the largest private holder of Bitcoin. Similarly, Tether Holdings Limited, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap, USDt, has accumulated 82,454 BTC worth approximately $8.3 billion. These private firms view Bitcoin as not only a store of value but also as a strategic asset that complements their business models in the blockchain and cryptocurrency ecosystems. For Tether, its significant allocation underscores the company’s recognition of Bitcoin’s deflationary attributes and store-of-value properties amidst growing economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. By incorporating Bitcoin into its reserves, Tether not only strengthens its balance sheet, but also aligns with the broader cryptocurrency ethos of decentralisation and financial innovation. Tether has also invested in Bitcoin-related ventures such as mining and energy investments, signalling a strategic approach to integrating Bitcoin into its operational framework beyond reserve management. This strategy reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value and highlights its utility as a hedge and diversification tool in corporate treasuries. Among publicly-listed companies Marathon Digital Holdings and Riot Platforms, which hold 40,435 BTC and 11,425 BTC respectively, they have leveraged their operational focus to build substantial Bitcoin reserves. These companies exemplify how both operational alignment and strategic investments in Bitcoin can diversify balance sheets and position firms as significant players in the digital asset space. With growing global adoption, these treasury strategies reflect a broader shift toward integrating Bitcoin into traditional corporate financial practices. What are the Trade-Offs of Holding a Digital Asset like Bitcoin in a Company Treasury? Holding Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset offers distinct advantages, particularly in its potential as a hedge against inflation. With a fixed supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin is inherently deflationary, making it appealing for companies seeking to preserve purchasing power in an environment of depreciating fiat currencies. As monetary policies continue to expand money supplies globally, businesses holding significant cash reserves may find Bitcoin an effective safeguard against inflationary pressures. This quality positions Bitcoin as a modern equivalent to “digital gold,” offering financial resilience and long-term value preservation in volatile economic climates. Bitcoin’s historical performance as a high-growth asset presents an opportunity for substantial capital appreciation. Companies that invested in Bitcoin during earlier adoption phases have often realised significant returns, boosting the value of their holdings and enhancing shareholder wealth. The notable case of MicroStrategy exemplifies how adopting Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset can increase market visibility, reinforce an innovative corporate image, and drive stock performance. Such returns not only benefit a company’s financial standing but also attract investor attention, particularly in technology-forward industries. Despite its benefits, holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset carries significant risks, primarily due to its inherent volatility. Price swings can lead to substantial unrealised losses on corporate balance sheets, complicating financial reporting and potentially unsettling investors. For companies reliant on stable cash reserves for operations, this unpredictability poses a considerable challenge. Bitcoin’s volatility demands a higher tolerance for financial risk, which may not align with the objectives of organizations that prioritise stability and predictability in their fiscal strategies. Additionally, regulatory uncertainties and market challenges add another layer of complexity. The evolving global landscape for cryptocurrency regulation means companies face potential legal and compliance risks, with governments still refining rules on taxation, reporting, and asset classification. Beyond regulatory concerns, companies may encounter reputational risks, particularly from stakeholders focused on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations. Bitcoin mining’s association with high energy consumption could deter environmentally conscious investors, potentially clashing with corporate sustainability goals, even though these fears have largely been debunked by the fact that Bitcoin mining has been found to incentivise sustainable energy policy . These factors require businesses to adopt meticulous planning and robust risk management strategies to navigate the potential pitfalls while leveraging Bitcoin’s transformative financial potential.

37595488,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662162,1734112850,Bitcoin Price Dominance And Altcoin Season: What The Sudden Volatility Means For The Market,"Crypto analyst Master Kenobi has provided extensive analysis, which discusses the Bitcoin price dominance and altcoin season. In his analysis, Master Kenobi also revealed what this sudden volatility means for the market. Where The Bitcoin Price Dominance Is Headed In an X post, Master Kenobi stated that the Bitcoin price dominance was meant to have begun its decline yesterday. However, the drop started 20 days earlier than anticipated. The crypto analyst added that. Having recorded three consecutive red weeks, Bitcoin’s dominance has entered a phase of volatility that could last for some time. Related Reading: XRP Price Flashes Falling Wedge Pattern, Why $2.8 Is A Possible Target From Here The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that the Bitcoin price dominance experienced this volatility phase for 136 days. If history were to repeat itself, this volatility won’t end until April 6 next year. Master Kenobi opined that the market is currently in the first and likely the most critical stage of capital rotation from Bitcoin profits. Once the market moves past this period of capital rotation, Master Kenobi predicts that a massive drop in dominance will follow, which, on the other hand, can be interpreted as the start of the altcoin season. Master Kenobi stated that even if the bull market extends beyond April 6, this period will likely be the most prolific for most altcoins. Master Kenobi noted that the bottom in the Bitcoin price dominance on May 14, 2021, coincided with the first peak of the crypto market during the 2021 bull run. The analyst expects a similar pattern to unfold this time around. Meanwhile, the analyst indicated that the bottom in the dominance could happen at the beginning of March instead of April 6. From The Bitcoin Halving Perspective Master Kenobi also used the Bitcoin halving date as a reference point to prove that the Bitcoin price dominance could move along with these timelines. He noted that in the previous cycle, there was a short interval (four days) between the one-year anniversary of the Bitcoin halving on May 11 and the first major bottom in dominance on May 15. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price On Its Way To $1: Why A Retest Of $0.48 Is More Important Than Anything In line with this, the analyst remarked that the timeline for the bottom in the Bitcoin price dominance (which would also mark the peak for the crypto market) can extend beyond April 20 to April 23, 2025. Master Kenobi cautioned that the exact date for the market peak cannot be pinpointed at this moment. However, as time passes, he believes that there is a likelihood that he will be able to pinpoint with greater accuracy the date when the first phase of the bull market will end. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at $100,300, down in the last 24 hours, while its dominance is at 55.13%, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

37595645,https://blockworks.co/news/unpacking-the-based-rollups-debate,1734112800,Understanding the debate around based rollups,"Ethereum loves rollups. As of late, “based” rollups are in vogue. What makes based rollups special? Its sequencer. Layer-2s today use a trusted centralized sequencer to order users’ transactions before they are posted down to the layer-1 for settlement, but based rollups defer those execution duties to Ethereum layer-1 validators. This is otherwise known as “based sequencing.” There are two primary reasons this is preferable: censorship resistance and interoperability. Using the layer-1 as a sequencer ensures the same liveness guarantees as Ethereum layer-1 blocks, and avoids the major complaints of potential censorship surrounding trusted centralized sequencers. Read more: MagicBlock open sources a16z-backed ‘ephemeral rollup’ tech The second advantage of based rollups is better interoperability. Based rollup proponents such as Justin Drake have in recent months touted this benefit as “ synchronous composability ,” where transactions in Ethereum are sequenced (or bridged) across different layer-2s at the same time. Simply put, smart contracts on based rollups will be able to call any other contract on the layer-1 in near-instant finality within the same block — as if they were all on the same chain. This composability and “money legos” is not exactly new; it was always one of the core properties sold with the original vision of Ethereum. Read more: Rethinking Ethereum consensus with Beam Chain But the fragmented state of rollups today means an Arbitrum transaction is asynchronous with an Optimism transaction, which creates problems of fee uncertainty. Fee uncertainty arises because gas fees are calculated in different slot times, as opposed to within the same 12-second slot time of one Ethereum block. In addition to making Ethereum seamlessly interoperable again, there are also different kinds of significant cost savings, Ahmad Mazen Bitar, technical product lead at Nethermind and Ethereum ACD developer, explains. “A user may want to swap his token on the [layer-1] but wants to take advantage of a deep liquidity pool on a [layer-2]. With synchronous composability, they would be able to push a singular transaction from the [layer-1] to the [layer-2], execute it, then bring it back to the [layer-1].” The first and largest existing based rollup in live production today is Taiko, which recently saw a burst in TVL and daily transactions this month. Source: DefiLlama Other early based rollups are also in early production, such as Surge by the Nethermind team, and UniFi by the Puffer Finance team. Both are forks of Taiko. Based rollups don’t come without its own drawbacks, however. Since execution (i.e. sequencing duties) is now being relegated back to layer-1 block validators, that means based rollups are constrained by the layer-1’s 12-second block time. Hence, the purported benefits of based rollups, like synchronous composability, may be easier said than done. Based rollups would require real-time proving within the latency of one 12-second slot, without which based rollups cannot execute composable transactions speedily. To have that kind of fast proof generation in turn brings another technological dependency into the mix, but Brecht Devos, co-founder and chief technology officer of Taiko, remains confident the tech is catching up. It’s why Taiko recently enabled two zk proofs on its rollup by Risc Zero and Succinct Labs, on top of Intel’s SGX trusted execution environment (TEE). This made it the first multi-proof based rollup in production without reliance on one trusted party. “Provers are improving quickly with more TEEs, faster and cheaper zkVMs and AVSs that can be used. We think the zk development is going very well and the sub-slot latency for proving is not far off,” Devos told Blockworks. One other believed disadvantage of based rollups is a loss of MEV as a key “revenue” stream, due to the lack of a centralized sequencer. Yet there are nifty workarounds available, Devos said. On Taiko, “MEV can also be captured by auctioning “execution tickets” to layer-1 block proposers,” Devos told Blockworks. As such, while based rollups by default give up sequencing rights to layer-1 validators, it doesn’t necessarily have to be the case. Matthew Edelen, co-founder of Spire Labs, a based rollup infrastructure provider, shares a similar view. As he explained on a recent Bell Curve podcast: “Auctions don’t have to be the only way to distribute sequencing rights. You could distribute 99% of sequencing rights through an auction and give the last 1% to friends or solo stakers to look good on L2Beat.” Finally, MEV may not even be such a big deal in the long run. This idea centres on a simple cost benefit analysis: Today, the bulk of blockchain revenues are coming from congestion fees, dwarfing a far smaller share of MEV revenues that is diminishing over time due to better MEV solutions. As such, the smarter rollup revenue model for rollups is one that banks on the greater network effects of congestion fees coming from synchronous composability, rather than MEV fees. As Justin Drake explained on the The Rollup podcast: “Congestion fees against contention fees is roughly at an 80:20 ratio today. 80% of the income on the [layer-1] comes from congestion fees — about 3200 eth per day since EIP-1559. MEV is about 800 ETH daily since the Merge. My thesis is that this ratio is becoming more extreme, going from 80:20 to something like 99:1.” In conclusion, the benefits of based rollups bring the user experience of Ethereum back full circle. There’s a sense of irony here, considering that these benefits were what blockchains already had from day one. Synchronous composability and layer-1 sequencing transactions have been the norm for all blockchains since the Bitcoin network’s genesis. This deviation of execution layer duties only happened due to the rollup-centric roadmap (or the multichain path in Polkadot, Cosmos and Avalanche) as of the last few years. Based rollups are ready to run it back. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

37595384,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312686,1734112670,"Bybit Advances Regulatory Compliance, Temporarily Adjusts EEA Operations","December 13, 2024 – Dubai, United Arab Emirates Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, continues to reinforce its commitment to transparency and regulatory compliance. In response to evolving regulations, Bybit has made the difficult but necessary decision to temporarily adjust the availability of its products and services within the EEA (European Economic Area). Paving the way with MiCAR compliance Bybit is actively pursuing a MiCAR (markets in crypto-assets regulation) license in Austria, a cornerstone of its compliance-first approach. This effort underscores Bybit’s dedication to aligning with stringent European regulatory standards, enhancing user protection and delivering a secure trading environment. Ben Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Bybit, said, “Obtaining the MiCAR license will be a strategic milestone for Bybit. “Our proactive stance ensures that we meet and exceed the expectations of both regulators and our users, as we work toward a future where innovation and compliance co-exist seamlessly.” Temporary adjustments to EEA operations To ensure ongoing compliance with applicable regulatory laws, particularly regarding reverse solicitation, Bybit has made the difficult decision to generally cease all communication with the EEA region. This measure is intended to avoid any potential breach of the strict reverse solicitation principle. Existing customers’ access to their crypto assets remains uninterrupted. Although this was a challenging decision, it was necessary for Bybit to maintain its compliance-first approach. Bybit is actively working towards obtaining a MiCAR license in Austria to become one of the first players in the EEA. Once the appropriate licensing is secured, Bybit will start engagement with its EEA clients in accordance with applicable laws. Balancing innovation with compliance Zhou added, “As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow globally, it is Bybit’s mission to deliver secure and reliable trading experiences underpinned by robust regulatory framework to all crypto communities. “To ensure we meet the highest standards and pave the way for a safer and more sustainable future for the industry, we’ve made the proactive decision to temporarily adjust our operations in the EEA. “This allows us to focus on obtaining the necessary licenses and ensuring a fully compliant platform focused on serving EEA clients.” Commitment to the EEA market Bybit will be deeply committed to serving its EEA clients once it receives a MiCAR license. The company is actively engaging with regulatory authorities to expedite the licensing process and start full operations in the region. Bybit appreciates the support of its users as it navigates this pivotal regulatory journey. For questions or assistance, users are encouraged to contact Bybit’s customer support team via live chat.

37597027,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319254,1734112554,XRP Eyes All-Time High as Whales Move $95M – Could $5.85 Be Next?,"XRP has suffered an overnight selloff, with its fall to $2.32 marking a 4% decline in 24 hours. This loss is in line with the rest of the market, which is also weathering some profit-taking and uncertainty today, although some coins are up (e.g. Monero, Virtuals Protocol, Curve DAO, Gate, Optimism). XRP is now flat in the past week, but it remains up by an impressive 44% in a fortnight and 250% in a month. And while one whale has moved $95 million in XRP to Coinbase in the past 24 hours, the coin’s volume remains bullish, with one analyst suggesting it could rise as high as $5.85 in the current cycle. XRP Eyes All-Time High as Whales Move $95M – Could $5.85 Be Next? It’s entirely possible that the 35.4 million XRP moved to Coinbase yesterday has already sold, given the alt’s 24-hour dip. 39,430,019 #XRP (95,502,372 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbase https://t.co/UfflvIjbDL — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 12, 2024 Yet you could argue that this kind of profit-taking is a sign of XRP’s current strength more than anything, with the wallet owner above simply capitalizing on the coin’s recent gains. Other recent transfers show that large traders continue to bet big on XRP, with one whale buying 22.1 million XRP on Binance on December 10 . We’ve also seen Ripple itself shift around huge quantities of XRP , which, if nothing else, is a sign that the token is in demand for cross-border purposes. As such, XRP’s picture remains entirely positive. The coin today posted a 24-hour trading volume of $10 billion, which is still just over 800% higher than a quarter ago. Its chart today suggests that it may suffer for one or two more days before it launches a concerted recovery, with its indicators signaling a loss of near-term momentum. Source: TradingView For example, its 30-period average (orange) looks about to drop below the 200-period average (blue), which normally indicates an approaching selloff. Likewise, its relative strength index (purple) has fallen towards 40 in the past few hours, meaning that XRP may not recover until the indicator touches 30. Despite its short-term weakness, many holders and traders are confident that XRP will soon begin approaching its current ATH ($3.40), with some suggesting even higher targets. 1.

37595333,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312609,1734112517,Ukraine Primed To Legalize Cryptocurrency in the First Quarter of 2025: Report,"Ukrainian legislators are reportedly likely to approve a proposed law that will legalize cryptocurrency in the country. Citing a statement from Danylo Hetmantsev, chairman of the unicameral parliament Verkhovna Rada’s Financial, Tax and Customs Policy Committee, the Ukrainian online newspaper Epravda reports there is a high probability that Ukraine will legalize cryptocurrency in the first quarter of 2025. Says Hetmantsev, “If we talk about cryptocurrency, the working group is completing the preparation of the relevant bill for the first reading. I think that the text together with the National Bank and the IMF will be after the New Year and in the first quarter we will pass this bill, legalize cryptocurrency.” But Hetmantsev says cryptocurrency transactions will not enjoy tax benefits. The government will tax profits from asset conversions according to the securities model. “In consultation with European experts and the IMF, we are very cautious about the use of cryptocurrencies with tax benefits, as an opportunity to avoid taxation in traditional markets.” The development comes amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this year, Russian lawmakers passed a bill to enable the use of cryptocurrency in international trade as the nation faces Western sanctions, causing payment delays that affect supply chains and costs.

37597556,https://invezz.com/?p=2387117,1734112501,"From HAWK to JASON, how celeb-fueled meme coins turned dreams into nightmares","Meme coins have been all the rage this bull season, and everyone from retail investors to mainstream celebrities has hopped in on the trend to capitalise on the hype and chase explosive short-term gains. What was once a nice subset of the crypto sector limited to Dogecoin has become a multi-billion dollar market that peaked at over $137.6 billion as of December 2024. Meme coins blend elements of popular culture, humour, and social media trends with decentralised tokenomics to create hype-driven cryptocurrencies. The promise of quick profits, often fueled by endorsements from high-profile figures, draws in countless investors who are lured by the potential for quick returns. While some of these tokens have made people rich overnight, the harsh reality is that most meme coins lack real value, with many investors losing heavily due to hype-driven movements and insider trading schemes. From Hawk Tuah to Mother, this season’s implosions reveal that celebrity endorsements may drive hype but provide no guarantee of legitimacy, as 90% of such tokens ultimately fail , leaving investors to bear the losses. Riches to rags Perhaps the most talked-about meme coin this fall was Hawk Tuah (HAWK), inspired by Hailey Welch’s viral 2024 interview where she famously said, “You gotta give ’em that ‘hawk tuah’ and spit on that thing.” The comment went viral in no time, and as Welch capitalised on her newfound fame, the idea of a meme coin emerged amid the crypto community’s embrace of the meme coin season in October. Lighthearted endorsements, including one from Mark Cuban on her podcast, helped turn the concept into reality. However, HAWK’s December 4 launch was disastrous, with its value plummeting 91% in just three hours as allegations of sniping and insider trading surfaced across social media. The token’s market cap had tumbled from $500 million to $60 million within 20 minutes post-launch. Another infamous case of pump and dump involves masculinity influencer and self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate, who launched the Solana-based meme coin Daddy Tate (DADDY). Marketed as a symbol of male empowerment with the slogan “flip it for the patriarchy,” the token quickly drew criticism after on-chain analytics by Bubblemaps revealed substantial insider trading. Insiders had allegedly acquired 30% of the supply early, with holdings valued at over $45 million, raising concerns about fairness and transparency. Things got worse after the crypto community hopped in to investigate and found that 11 Binance-linked wallets purchased 20% of the supply on June 9, just before Tate’s promotion on X. While Tate himself did not sell his tokens, the coordinated insider activity positioned these holders for massive profits, while clueless investors were left with nothing but worthless tokens and regrets. Popular singer and dancer Jason Derulo’s token was no exception to controversy. Launched in June 2024, Jason (JASON) quickly rose to massive heights after Derulo’s promotions but saw its value crash by over 70% shortly after, leaving investors furious. Derulo pinned the blame on crypto influencer Sahil Arora, accusing him of engineering a pump-and-dump scheme for personal gain. But Bubblemaps suggested otherwise. It revealed that wallets allegedly linked to Arora controlled half of JASON’s supply and sold almost all of it, after Derulo’s promotional post. However, the analytics platform also uncovered a wallet reportedly connected to Derulo himself, which offloaded $20,000 worth of tokens—contradicting his prior promise that he would “never sell.” The list goes on, from Caitlyn Jenner and Davido to Iggy Azalea and 50 Cent, but the common thread among these celebrity-backed tokens is that the overwhelming majority lose most of their value once the initial hype fades. And it extends beyond celebrities to everyday influencers, many of whom are equally guilty of endorsing useless tokens for their monetary gains. 90% of celebrity-backed tokens die in three months A November study by research firm Coinwire that analysed meme coins launched by 377 influencers on X found that 76% of these promoted meme coins had lost over 90% of their value and hence were considered dead. Within three months, 86% of these tokens reportedly dropped by ten times, with the report claiming that only 3% of meme coins promoted by influencers delivered on the gains as promised. The worst part was the fact that several influencers were found to be promoting tokens that had no activity in the hopes of lining up their pockets. While investors often lose their life savings trading these volatile cryptocurrencies, influencers were found to be earning an average of $399 for every promotional tweet. Sadly, in most cases, there’s little recourse for small investors, as the legal situation surrounding these promotions remains complex. The legal repercussions In simple terms, manipulating markets is and will always be a crime. Celebrities and influencers found guilty of such activities can face charges ranging from fraud to securities violations. Even in the unregulated and evolving world of meme coins, prosecutors don’t need new laws to hold individuals accountable—they can simply apply existing criminal fraud statutes to these cases. To convict a celebrity involved in a pump-and-dump scheme, prosecutors must show that the celebrity intentionally devised a strategy to deceive investors, intended to profit at their expense, and used communication tools like phones or the internet to execute the scheme. However, the fraud must have impacted interstate or international trade, which is almost always the case in cryptocurrency transactions. So, while the meme coin craze might feel like a free-for-all, legal consequences are very real. If a token launch looks and operates like a pump-and-dump, prosecutors can and will connect the dots to bring charges. But the reason we don’t see many charges is that regulators focus their limited resources on high-profile cases where they can recover significant sums in disgorgement rather than going after smaller influencers or vague promotions that would cost more to pursue than they’re worth. Conclusion Meme coins might be a boon for many, but the majority of investors have seen their dreams turn into nightmares. This doesn’t mean that all cryptocurrencies in this category are bad, as several of these projects feature strong communities and are often backed by a solid cause. Still, investors must be extremely cautious and do proper research before putting their hard-earned money into these risky assets. One thing is for certain: meme coins are not going to go away anytime soon, and with the introduction of platforms like Pump.fun and Sun Pump , which makes launching a meme coin as easy as installing an app on a smartphone, the trend is only going to get more intense. Instead of following the hype, pundits like Changpeng Zhao and Vitalik Buterin recommend focusing on cryptocurrencies that actually provide real value or solve real problems. Focusing on utility is always a smarter way to support meaningful growth in the crypto space because, ultimately, that’s what will decide the viability of the crypto and blockchain industry in the long run and not that token based on an image someone found funny.

37595377,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744175-bitdeer-sell-the-1-billion-shelf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,1734112473,Bitdeer: Sell The $1 Billion Shelf,"Summary Bitdeer Technologies has delivered a 220% rally in four months, outperforming most Bitcoin mining stocks this year. Despite recent gains, a new $1 billion mixed shelf offering could lead to significant dilution and potential underperformance. Previous capital raises include $150 million in August and $400 million in late-November private placement notes show the company's willingness to raise. Even without the shelf, BTDR is trading at a massive book value premium to most mining stocks and the broader revenue trend is not a good one. Bitdeer Technologies ( BTDR ) has been one of the best performing Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) mining stocks this year. After only TeraWulf ( WULF ) and Core Scientific ( CORZ ), no other mining stock has generated a better year to date return than BTDR. But the 102% year to date return for BTDR really doesn't even do the stock's recent rally justice. Since I last covered the name for Seeking Alpha in August, BTDR shareholders who ignored my 'hold' call and bought the stock under $7 have been handsomely rewarded with a face-ripping 220% four month rally. Data by YCharts Well done, bulls. This is why I try to avoid outright 'sell' calls on stocks even if I feel there are valid fundamental issues. Attachment to Bitcoin can make any stock volatile and mining stocks are possibly the best example of Bitcoin-adjacent volatility. I'm making an exception today. For Bitdeer specifically, there is now a very large overhang on the stock that, I believe, will shift BTDR from a position of brief sector out-performance to one of under-performance for the foreseeable future. That overhang in a word, dilution. The Shelf Offering Just four months ago the company issued $150 million in senior notes . More recently, Bitdeer announced $360 million in convertible notes that pay 5.25% in a late-November private placement. The company disclosed the closing of that offering at $400 million during its November production update. Now we have the prospect of yet another capital raise, and this one is bigger than the other two combined. On December 11th, Bitdeer filed a prospectus to raise $1 billion through a mixed shelf offering that could include common stock, debt securities, and/or warrants. Data by YCharts While we don't yet know when this offering will begin or the pricing of any equity issuance, the prospect of a $1 billion capital raise could mean significant dilution for current shareholders at a $3.6 billion current market capitalization. Consider, the closing price of Bitdeer common shares was $18.90 when the prospectus was filed. At $21.37 on December 12th, BTDR shares are trading at nearly 7x book value. Compare this with large mining peers: Data by YCharts Bitdeer's price to book value is running 3 to 4 times other miners in the sector. The only conclusion I can draw from this is that BTDR is wildly overvalued compared to the rest of the large public miners. Frankly, it would be shortsighted for the company to not tap the spigots at these share price levels and capture some of the implied value in the equity by issuing common stock shares. Thus, I suspect they will do so and likely rather soon. Retail Hype and SEALMINER Expectations BTDR Daily Chart (TrendSpider) There is admittedly quite a bit of excitement in the market about BTDR at this point in time. Based on both the spike in percentage of trading activity and some of the postings I'm seeing on places like X and YouTube, Bitdeer has been generating quite a bit of buzz with retail traders over the last few weeks. Much of the hype is likely a result of Bitdeer's SEALMINER A2 machine which apparently has just under 1.4 million reservations already booked. SEALMINER Reservation Page (Wayback Machine) Though I think it's important to point out that 99 cent reservations without KYC do not necessarily mean there will be 1.4 million SEALMINER orders when it's all said and done. I think it's also interesting that the Wayback Machine is indicating that there have only been about 40k new reservations since late July even though the price of Bitcoin has essentially doubled over the same time frame. Ultimately what matters is whether or not Bitdeer turns these reservations into revenue growth. Because Q3's numbers show a continuation of a concern I've laid out in prior pieces covering the company. Revenue Story For the quarter ended September, Bitmain reported $62 million in top-line revenue. This was a 37% sequential drop from $99.2 million in Q2 and a 29% year over year decline from $87.3 million in Q3-23. Data by YCharts More importantly, for the third consecutive quarter Cloud Hash Rate revenue has declined. At the reported $7.1 million, Cloud Hash Rate generated just 11.5% of Bitdeer's top line revenue in Q3. For context, Cloud Hash was Bitdeer's primary revenue driver for much of 2022 before falling drastically last year. Analyst's Chart, Bitdeer Filings Self-mining now accounts for just over 50% of the company's total revenue. This is potentially a concerning long term trend because self-mining happens to be bad for gross profit as the segment lost $3.2 million in Q3. Q3 Revenue Breakout (Bitdeer) Cloud Hash Rate continues to be the best moneymaker for the company on a gross margin basis and yet revenue from that segment declined by 55% year over year. The only segment that generated year-over-year growth for Bitdeer was self-mining. Which, again, is a problem because the segment hasn't been profitable for the company following the block reward halving. Bitcoin Production Of course, markets are supposed to be forward looking and higher Q4 Bitcoin prices should drive revenues for Bitdeer. The company had 17.1 total hash under management in Q3. Bitdeer's November production update showed 20.7 EH/s under management with 8.2 of that hash allocated to self-mining. Analyst's Chart, Bitdeer filings For the month, Bitdeer produced 150 BTC from that hash and 174 BTC during the month of October. November Production BTC Mined EH/s BTC per EH/s Marathon Digital ( MARA ) 907 46.1 19.67 TeraWulf ( WULF ) 115 5.9 19.49 HIVE Digital ( HIVE ) 103 5.3 19.43 IREN Limited ( IREN ) 379 19.7 19.24 Riot Platforms ( RIOT ) 495 25.8 19.19 Bitfarms ( BITF ) 204 10.7 19.07 CleanSpark ( CLSK ) 622 33.7 18.46 Bitdeer 150 8.2 18.29 Bit Digital ( BTBT ) 45 2.5 18.00 Cipher Mining ( CIFR ) 202 12.0 16.83 Source: Company filings From a BTC per EH/s standpoint, there are several public companies that are running more efficient fleets than Bitdeer. That could certainly change given some of the advertised specs we're seeing from the new SEALMINER machine. But until we see actual performance metrics, self-mining is still potentially a headwind for Bitdeer rather than a tailwind due to it being a net income loser following the halving. To be sure, Bitcoin prices are higher than they were in Q3. But so is the global hash rate, and we're already seeing signs that Q4 BTC production may be lower than Q3. Even if we assume Bitdeer can continue to produce at the three-month average of 163 BTC per month, the company's stock is trading at more than 15x forward BTC sales at $100k Bitcoin price. Since half the company's revenue comes from other segments, we can cut it down to just under 8x forward sales. Bottom line, BTDR is not cheap up here and management seems poised to take advantage of that mispricing through the shelf offering. Closing Thoughts It's certainly true that I've missed a fantastic run in BTDR shares. I think traders and investors who bought under $10 have obviously made the right call by getting in before the rally. However, I think the gains have been had here for the time being. The company is going through a revenue generation transition that is a fairly large gamble. In addition to entering the HPC/AI space with the rest of the Bitcoin miners, Bitdeer's broad revenue trend has been one of increasing reliance on the less profitable segment. Bitcoin's price increase can theoretically help BTDR grow top line, but history shows us each halving cycle has a blow off top and then a large decline. I see a lot of hype about BTDR right now at the same time the company is hoping to raise $1 billion. It's difficult for me to see how BTDR shares stay above $20 for much longer. I think the stock is a sell. I would not advise shorting it. But if I were long, I'd take the win.",NEGATIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4744175-bitdeer-sell-the-1-billion-shelf?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/37595377.jpeg
37595325,https://crypto.news/?p=14319223,1734112437,What is Hedera Hashgraph? HBAR crypto explained,"The Internet is a big world; every country represents a digital ledger. Most of these ledgers are blockchains but most have ‘slow economies’. Here is where the global leader Hedera Hashgraph comes into the picture. It is a distributed ledger technology that replaces the old blockchain system, making the ‘economy’ fast, fair, and secure. Table of Contents What is HBAR? How does Hedera Hashgraph work? How to use Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR? Key features and benefits of Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR How to buy, store, and use HBAR Challenges and criticisms Future of HBAR and Hedera Hashgraph In this article, we will discuss what is hedera hashgraph, how it works, its key features, the challenges it faces, and the future of Hedera ( HBAR ). Read more: HBAR hits seven-month high after 47% rally as whales accumulate What is HBAR? The Hedera (HBAR) token is the native token of the Hedera ecosystem. The entire network’s transactions are fueled by HBAR, which guarantees their speed and security. In simpler words, you can consider Hedera’s HBAR as the rocket fuel, allowing users to pay for network services like file storage, smart contracts, and token production. Through staking , HBAR contributes significantly to preserving the integrity of the network in addition to serving as a transactional tool for users to take advantage of the key features offered by Hedera’s infrastructure. At the time of writing, the HBAR token is trading at around $0.313 and has experienced around 800% price surge in the past 2 months. Hedera Hashgraph weekly chart | Tradingview How does Hedera Hashgraph work? A decentralized network of nodes makes up the Hedera Hashgraph ecosystem, which verifies transactions and adds them to the common ledger. The Public Hedera Network’s Hashgraph consensus method is built for fast transaction speeds and low latency, guaranteeing quick and effective transaction processing. Fundamentally, Hedera Hashgraph relies on a novel consensus process known as “gossip about gossip.” Until everyone agrees, nodes exchange information about who they spoke with and what transactions they are aware of. Byzantine Fault Tolerance and fairness are maintained while the inefficiencies of blockchain’s proof-of-work are eliminated. The network is very quick and impenetrable since transactions are timestamped and arranged according to when the majority of the network gets them. The Hedera platform allows developers to create smart contracts that facilitate the execution of transactions and the operation of decentralized apps. The platform’s native cryptocurrency , HBAR, is utilized for handling and safeguarding network transactions. A technical board and a council oversee the platform, and HBAR holders have the power to shape significant choices about the project’s future. Now let’s discuss what is Hedera Hashgraph used for. How to use Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR? Using Hedera is a straightforward process. It offers APIs that let developers manage smart contracts, create tokens, and build decentralized apps. The Hedera ecosystem is made up of several components that cooperate to form the network as a whole. It consists of nodes that record transactions, developers who use the Hedera SDK to create dApps and smart contracts, businesses, and organizations like IBM and LG that play around with the technology. For more efficient operations, businesses can use Hedera’s token services and file storage. HBAR can also be used by regular users to make payments, stake, or communicate with dApps. To enter this quick and safe ecosystem, all you need is some HBAR and a wallet that works with Hedera. Hedera’s cryptocurrency holders use the cryptocurrency for platform oversight and operations, and dApp users take advantage of the quick and safe transactions made possible by Hashgraph technology. You might also like: What is tokenization and how does it work Key features and benefits of Hedera Hashgraph and HBAR Speed is one of the key features of Hedera Hashgraph as it is designed to handle thousands of transactions per second with very low latency. It is environmentally beneficial thanks to its energy-efficient consensus method. It also offers key benefits including its Hedera services which include Consensus-as-a-service (CaaS), file storage, identity management, and cryptocurrency payments. These services use hashgraph technology, which offers lightning-fast speeds, safety, and flexibility. The Hedera platform’s native cryptocurrency is called HBAR Token. In addition to voting on important platform decisions, it is utilized to process and secure network transactions. Furthermore, the Hedera SDK gives developers the resources and tools they need to create smart contracts and dApps on the Hedera platform. It provides a large selection of languages of programming as well as the ability to integrate with other platforms and programming tools. The usefulness of HBAR extends to network transaction fuelling, governance, and staking. It is a solid option for both developers and businesses because of its fairness, decentralization, and regulatory compliance features. How to buy, store, and use HBAR Buying, selling, and storing Hedera’s cryptocurrency i.e. the HBAR token is a straightforward process. The easy way is to create an account on any major centralized exchange like Binance, Coinbase, or Bybit. Then you can deposit fiat currency and buy a stable coin in which HBAR is traded on that exchange. In this case, it can be USDT or USDC. Then you can buy the HBAR token at its current price or set a buy limit on which you want to buy the HBAR token. After buying the tokens will show in your exchange wallet after which you can sell them by using market or limit order. The other option is to use decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Pancakeswap to buy HBAR tokens which can be done after creating a digital crypto wallet like Metamask. After buying the token you can secure it in your digital crypto wallet and sell it by going to any decentralized exchange. If you don’t want to store HBAR tokens in your digital wallet or any centralized exchange you can also stake HBAR by following the official guide here . Challenges and criticisms Hedera Hashgraph offers impressive technology that solves a lot of problems that normal blockchains don’t, however, despite its excellent technology, its governance mechanism comes under criticism now and then. This is because, despite the diversity of its governance council, the authorities on the governance panel are centralized which points questions to the core concept of decentralization on which every cryptocurrency stands on. Additionally, the coding behind Hedera Hashgraph isn’t open-source which can be a security issue as public audit of code is often a better alternative than keeping it private. While Hedera does claim to be highly scalable this claim hasn’t been tested in the real world, however, as crypto gets wider acceptance, a large number of users can be onboarded to Hedera’s platform and it may pose a challenge to it in the future. Future of HBAR and Hedera Hashgraph The roadmap outlined by Hedera’s team is impressive. The network’s potential for use in the gaming, supply chain, and financial industries increases as it shifts to a more decentralized governance and consensus architecture. The usefulness of HBAR will increase with further improvements, such as mirror nodes for increased transparency and sharding for scalability. Collaborations with significant corporations such as Google and IBM show faith in Hedera’s goal. A promising future is indicated by the growing usage of Hedera for identity management, tokenization, and safe micropayments. Hedera has the potential to be a key component of Web3 infrastructure if it can successfully negotiate regulatory environments and keep coming up with new ideas. You might also like: What is DeFi?

As hodlers double down on their Solana ( SOL ), Glassnode has pointed to recent selling pressure as having come from last bull market’s holders. This is a cohort in the one-to-two-year group of buyers that likely elected to take profits as Solana rode the crypto uptick post-U.S. election to its current bull cycle peak. “The 1-2 year cohort has steadily diminished, dropping from 48% in June to just below 5% now.

Backed by Metalpha, Waterdrip Capital, BIT Mining, Animoca Brands, and more, Prosper has procured the new ASIC miners from BITMAIN to bring institutional-grade execution quality to its protocol Prosper aims to expand its underlying Bitcoin hashrate capacity to accelerate the flywheel of DAO-owned hashrate and Bitcoin treasury operations & democratize access to institutional-grade mining Following the announcement of Prosper’s long-term partnership and hosting service agreement with BITMAIN, the world’s leading manufacturer of digital currency mining servers, this landmark purchase marks an instrumental step in Prosper’s mission to provide institutional-grade reliability to its mining ecosystem. By leveraging BITMAIN’s cutting-edge products, Prosper enhances the value delivered to its PROS token holders, further distinguishing itself as the premier Web3 Bitcoin mining protocol backed by leading industry players. “Bitcoin brought about a fundamental shift in finance by democratizing an economic system in its entirety with blockchain technology. Prosper follows the footsteps of Bitcoin’s core ethos by democratizing access to Bitcoin hashrate, the underlying layer powering Bitcoin-through blockchain technology. This layer of community governance and ownership afforded by blockchain allows Prosper to scale its flywheel of both Bitcoin hashrate and treasury operations while simultaneously helping to ensure that Bitcoin mining layer is sufficiently decentralized to maintain Bitcoin’s status as the most recognized digital reserve currency. ” said Milton Lam, Prosper Advisory Council Member. Prosper’s Latest Development 1 EH/s of hashrate procured and ready to fully go live (with 250 PH/s live on Prosper’s dApp already) Access to pipeline capacity of 170MW with the mid-term goal of adding another 5 EH/s More than 2 BTC rewards given out to PROS holders since November Access to more than 200 BTC to be delegated by launch partners to the DAO to unlock TVL opportunities for PROS holders Strategic Round Closure: Strengthening the Bitcoin Ecosystem In addition to its BITMAIN partnership, Prosper announced the closure of its strategic funding round, which saw participation from prominent industry players and financial investors, including Metalpha, Waterdrip Capital, BIT Mining, and Satoshi Protocol. Earlier in October, Animoca Brands also disclosed its intention to purchase PROS tokens from the open market. These investments demonstrate the strong confidence in Prosper’s vision of bridging institutional-grade Bitcoin mining power on-chain and its innovative approach to Bitcoin liquidity farming. The involvement of these strategic partners brings crucial industry expertise and networks to support Prosper’s operations as it scales. Positioning Prosper for Growth Prosper’s tokenomics adopts a unique design to ensure hashrate-per-token will only increase and be accretive to PROS holders. Prosper’s DAO leverages a unique flywheel model with both hashrate and Bitcoin treasury operations – all governed by and for the benefits of PROS holders. Institutional-grade hashrate generates Bitcoin on an ongoing basis, part of which is rewarded to holders for their active participation, and remaining goes to the DAO treasury. DAO’s treasury Bitcoin can be directed towards TVL opportunities with ecosystem partners such as Bitcoin L2 to generate benefits for PROS holders and the DAO. Growth in DAO treasury value and PROS adoption allows the protocol to further expand underlying hashrate and enhance protocol resilience. By combining institutional-grade Bitcoin mining hashrate, a decentralized protocol design backed by strong fundamentals, and an extensive network of strategic partners, Prosper is well-positioned to solidify its status as the flagship decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol. About Prosper Prosper is a decentralized protocol for a community that truly believes in Bitcoin, providing full exposure across Bitcoin hashrate and Bitcoin through tokenizing institutional-grade Bitcoin hashrate as omnichain RWA, and aims to fully unlock the potential of Bitcoin.

Shiba Inu Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin but has carved out its own path in the crypto world. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum’s vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB began with a staggering one quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation of a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum sets it apart from other meme coins. It powers ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and has plans for an NFT platform and a community-driven governance system. These developments hint at SHIB’s potential beyond being just a meme. In a market where utility and technology are gaining focus, SHIB’s ambitions could make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. As trends shift towards projects with real-world applications, SHIB’s evolution within the Ethereum ecosystem might attract those looking for more than just hype in the crypto space. Pepe PEPE is a new cryptocurrency inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme. Created as a tribute to Matt Furie’s character that gained fame in the early 2000s, PEPE embraces its meme origins wholeheartedly. Launched on the Ethereum network, this deflationary token aims to join the ranks of other successful meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a transparent approach, PEPE keeps things simple, attracting a community that appreciates its straightforward meme coin nature. In the current market cycle, PEPE has made a significant impact. Between late April and May 2023, its market cap soared to a peak of $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This explosive growth has sparked a “memecoin season,” with new meme-based tokens experiencing rapid rises and falls. While PEPE lacks traditional utility, its appeal lies in community engagement and the viral nature of memes. As the crypto world anticipates events like the upcoming Bitcoin halving, some see potential for PEPE to reach new heights. Its success highlights a trend where community and culture can drive value, even in the absence of conventional fundamentals. Conclusion While SHIB and PEPE have seen strong gains, XYZVerse aims to surpass them, uniting sports fans in a community-driven meme coin poised for 20,000% growth during the bull run.

The exchange noted that it will continue supporting MiCA-compliant assets like USD Coin (USDC) and EURC. In a Wednesday announcement set to its users, Coinbase wrote that “due to the new European Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, Coinbase will implement restrictions for stablecoin services that do not meet MiCA requirements.” Which Are The Stablecoins Affected? Other than USDT, retail customers on Coinbase Europe and Coinbase Germany will see the delisting of Paxos Standard Price (PAX), PayPal USD (PYUSD), and Gemini Dollar (GUSD). It’ll also impact GYEN and Maker Protocol’s DAI. Coinbase pointed out that USD Coin (USDC) and EUR Coin (EURC) are MiCA-compliant and will continue to be supported. For now, the platform suggests that its users sell or convert assets not compliant with the new regulatory requirements before the restriction date or transfer those tokens out of the exchange. MiCA’s first phase, which was implemented in June 2024, mandates stricter guidelines for stablecoins, with full compliance required by December 30. Coinbase encouraged users to convert restricted coins into approved ones and stated it will reassess delisted assets once they comply. Although MiCA regulators haven’t officially called USDT noncompliant, Coinbase’s actions reflect its effort to align with European regulatory standards. Tether Expresses Criticism Tether criticized the rushed implementation and confirmed its commitment to creating MiCA-compliant solutions for the region. This regulatory change is a key moment for European crypto markets as exchanges adapt to stricter rules. Notably, USDC issuer Circle secured a MiCA-valid license this summer, which drew attention from exchanges looking for a major stablecoin suitable for EU markets. Earlier this week, Binance partnered with US-based stablecoin issuer Circle to accelerate the adoption of the USDC stablecoin. On the other hand, a September report by Consumers’ Research criticized Tether’s USDT for lacking transparency about its dollar reserves, warning it could be risky for consumers.

The foundation which supports the restaking platform, Eigen Layer, announced this on X, noting that it is committed to Ethereum security. According to the Foundation, pledging 1% of its supply to the fund will enable the Protocol Guild to continue its work on Ethereum infrastructure development and ensure it stays decentralized. Given that the EIGEN token has a total supply of 1.68 billion, with 210.81 million currently in circulation, the pledge would see Protocol Guild get around 16.8 million EIGEN tokens over time. Based on the current value of the token, that would be worth $82.6 million. Eigen Foundation said: “By pledging 1% of EIGEN supply, we aim to ensure that the Protocol Guild can continue its mission to provide consistent funding for Ethereum maintainers, supporting their stewardship of the network.” Protocol Guild is an on-chain fund for the core maintainers of Ethereum L1 infrastructure. Its focus is on research and development to sustain the network and the group members work on several core developments within the Ethereum ecosystem, such as Beam Chain, zk-proofs, decentralized storage, and zk-proofs. Protocol Guild donations are to surpass $100 million Meanwhile, the pledge from Eigen Layer now means over a dozen projects have taken the Protocol Guild pledge to donate at least 1% of their token supply to the fund. According to data from Dune analytics regarding the restaking protocol, EtherFi was the first to commit 1% of its supply. Since then, several others have made similar moves, but the data has not yet been updated to include the Eigen Foundation commitment. Other major pledges include Taiko Labs, PWN DAO, Puffer, and EthStorage. More recently, Otto DAO, the community behind the on-chain lottery protocol LottoPGF, also committed 1% of its treasury to the Guild, while Alinged Foundation allocated 1.5% of the Aligned Layer token supply. However, other Ethereum-based projects and individuals have opted for direct donations, including popular L2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Zksync. Overall, Protocol Guild has received over 8,282 donations from almost 832 donors, who donated $92.9 million as of December 9, with Ether.Fi being the biggest donor, followed by TAIKO. The donated funds are being spent supporting various developers working on core Ethereum projects. Developers receive distributions based on their contributions to the Ethereum network. So far, the Guild has 187 members. Over the last two years, the project has distributed $38 million to developers, with each recipient receiving a median amount of $51,617 in the last 12 months. The Guild also plans to distribute a median amount of $79,342 to the developers in the next 12 months. The project currently has about $54 million, subject to a four-year vesting period. Ethereum developer activity in decline Meanwhile, the increase in financial commitment to Protocol Guild could not have come at a better time for the Ethereum network. Solana recently overtook Ethereum as the top ecosystem for developers for the first time since 2016. According to a report from Electric Capital, Solana attracted 7,625 new developers in 2024, compared to Ethereum’s 6,456. The increase in Solana developers is mostly due to growth in Asia, but it highlights how the network is attracting new builders. Nevertheless, Ethereum remains a major draw for most developers as it continues to have the highest developer activity of all blockchain networks, with 6,244 in 2024. However, monthly Ethereum developers fell by 17% compared to last year. Amidst all these, Eigen Layer emerged as the fastest-growing developer ecosystem.

As 2024 marks the era of adoption, many anticipate the US Government will begin building a strategic national Bitcoin reserve in the wake of Donald Trump’s landmark victory in November. HOLY SHIT. This may be the most bullish video I’ve ever seen for #Bitcoin . This woman manages a fund for people with a net worth of over $100M and she is convinced Trump will raise US bitcoin holdings to 1M coins and create a strategic reserve. pic.twitter.com/88g92QjD1X — ₿itcoinTeddy (@Bitcoin_Teddy) December 12, 2024 But it appears that the incoming President-elect’s interest in crypto doesn’t stop at the US Treasury. Close family members launched the famous World Liberty Financial presale, and now a Trump wallet is apeing huge amounts of leading altcoins . Trump Crypto Wallet Apes $10M in Chainlink (LINK) and Aave Crypto On-chain sleuths from LookOnChain, monitoring crypto wallets allegedly associated with the Trump family’s World Liberty Financial DeFi project, observed substantial transactions made by a WLFI address on December 11. So much for Dollar-Cost Averaging; over $12M in USDC was suddenly deployed in a wild buying spree that seemingly represented major value investments in key high-cap altcoins . Of the purchases, 83.3% of the USDC spent went on stacking 2,631 ETH (bought at a market value of $3,801). Additional allocations saw 8.33% spent on 41,335 LINK with a value of $1 (this Chainlink buy works out at a market price of $24.2) and 8.33% spent on 3,357 AAVE crypto with a value of $1M (bought at $297.8). The purchases were made using a multi-signature wallet , which opens the door to conjecture about whether the LINK and Aave crypto investments represent a decision by the Trump family office (involving multiple members of the Trump family) or whether it was made by a professional team in the Trump family’s employ. While the incoming President-elect has made his pro-crypto positions clear, the level of his personal involvement in cryptocurrency remains unknown. Much of his knowledge and interest reportedly stems from his sons Barron and Eric. It’s also notable that these purchases were made on the same day that Eric Trump visited Bitcoin MENA in Abu Dhabi, an event that has thrown hype behind promising cryptocurrencies like Chainlink – which announced a move to the UAE, and other rapidly growing projects in the space like Crypto All-Stars . New Meme Coin Staking DeFi Protocol Crypto All-Stars Launched in 7-Days After Explosive $13M Presale Smart money investors are anticipating the upcoming launch of a new DeFi protocol, Crypto All-Stars (STARS) in just 7-days time as the project’s successful $13M presale winds towards an end. Only limited time remains, with just a week left for early investors to claim their slice of the pie pre-DEX launch in what could be the easiest 10X play this December. Crypto All-Stars is on a mission to solve a major problem for retail investors in the space – the lack of passive earning offered by ERC-20, SOL, and BASE meme coins while traders hodl. The genius developers behind this project have solved this by introducing Meme Vaults, which enable retail investors to stake their meme coins to generate a passive high APY return. This not only enables investors to double down on their investments effectively but also helps motivate healthy holding behavior – acting to dampen the impact of ‘jeeting’ behavior in the market and helping to build solid project communities with strong gold banks. Analysts predict that Crypto All-Stars’ omnichain DeFi offering will unlock substantial growth in the market. Many meme coin projects are expected to form partnerships with the platform in the coming months. Additionally, an exciting 190% APY staking offer is already available for holders of popular tokens such as Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, Based Brett, MogCoin, Milady, TurboToken, Toshi The Cat, Coq Inu, and Bonk. Investors can purchase $STARS on the website with ETH, USDT, BNB, or bank card. Follow the team on social media – X (Twitter) | Telegram to stay up-to-date on all the developments.

37594391,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98835,1734110645,Ripple’s XRP Price Struggles Under $2.5 As Almost 3 Billion XRP Flood Binance,"XRP remained relatively quiet on Thursday, trading within a narrow range of $2.45 to $2.36. This comes after a modest recovery from a recent dip to $1.90 earlier this week, following a multi-year high of $2.90 on December 3. Notably, XRP , now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has seen a remarkable 250% rise over the past month, making it one of the standout performers in the recent crypto market rally. XRP’s recent bullish momentum was fueled by several key factors beyond riding the broader market uptrend sparked by Bitcoin’s rally following Donald Trump’s election victory last month. Optimism surrounding Ripple’s ongoing SEC lawsuit has played a significant role, with speculation about a potential leadership change and the dismissal of the case boosting investor confidence. Additionally, growing institutional interest has emerged through applications for XRP-related exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with filings from firms like 21Shares and WisdomTree further solidifying market enthusiasm. Adding to this excitement are rumors that Ripple may soon launch the RLUSD stablecoin , which has heightened anticipation and contributed to XRP’s recent gains. However, the price now hovers near the critical $2.50 support level, sparking concerns of a potential decline. Adding to the risk, substantial whale activity has intensified selling pressure, with CryptoQuant analyst J.A. Maartunn reporting a sharp increase in whale transactions involving Binance in the past month. “Over the past 30 days, more than 2.66 billion XRP tokens have been deposited into Binance.” Maartuun wrote. According to the analyst, this represents the highest level of whale activity since April 2024, signaling potential strategic shifts by these influential market participants, who often have the power to move prices substantially. Adding to the uncertainty, broader market dynamics also weigh heavily on XRP. On Wednesday, Swyftx lead analyst Pav Hundal warned that Bitcoin’s dominance, currently at 54.8%, could continue to rise, potentially diverting capital from altcoins like XRP. “In November, funds flowed out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Now, the trend has reversed—money is flowing back out of altcoins. XRP, SOL, and ETH market cap growth has stalled.” He tweeted. Furthermore, the rapid increase in leveraged trading has added another layer of risk. Open interest in XRP futures has surged to nearly $3.99 billion, almost doubling within a month. Historical trends suggest that such heightened leverage often precedes market corrections, raising further concerns about XRP’s near-term trajectory. Nevertheless, despite the challenging fundamentals, analyst Ali Martinez identified a potentially bullish setup for XRP, noting the formation of a bull flag pattern that could signal a breakout, potentially driving the price toward the $4 mark. However, the pundit also cautioned that the TD Sequential indicator recently issued a sell signal on the 4-hour chart, indicating a likely short-term correction before any breakout above $2.46.

37597025,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319371,1734110506,TON Blockchain’s Tact Language Has Security Risks – CertiK Audit,"A new security report has raised concerns about the Open Telegram Network ( TON ), a blockchain platform known for its user-friendly approach to smart contracts . The report , conducted by Web3 security firm CertiK, highlights potential vulnerabilities in Tact, the programming language specifically designed for TON. While Tact aims to simplify development and enhance security, the audit reveals that certain coding practices could inadvertently expose smart contracts to risks . Tact’s Hidden Security Traps CertiK compares Tact to its predecessor, FunC, identifying frequent mistakes that developers make when using the language. These errors can lead to transaction failures, loss of funds, and exploitable security gaps. One of the key concerns highlighted in the report is Tact’s strict address format. The format’s inconsistencies with existing standards, such as TEP-74, could result in failed transactions or lost tokens, similar to sending a letter to an incorrect address. CertiK also flagged challenges in managing concurrent operations. While the TON blockchain avoids vulnerabilities like reentrancy, which is common on Ethereum , its unpredictable transaction order could enable attackers to exploit timing differences, creating vulnerabilities akin to man-in-the-middle attacks . TON’s asynchronous and parallel processing of smart contracts makes it hard to track action order. Source: CertiK Another area of concern is data serialization. CertiK noted that developers need to explicitly organize data within smart contracts . Failure to do so could result in misinterpretations and unpredictable program behavior, comparable to assembling furniture with incomplete instructions. The report also highlighted potential errors in Tact’s handling of numbers, which could lead to glitches if developers are not vigilant. In addition, CertiK further emphasized the importance of managing “gas,” the fee required to execute blockchain transactions. Improper estimation and control of gas usage by developers can cause transactions to fail midway or potentially drain funds from a contract. Crypto Hacks in 2024: $1.5 Billion Lost Beyond the vulnerabilities in Tact, the broader crypto ecosystem continues to grapple with major security challenges. According to a report by Immunefi, nearly $1.5 billion has been stolen in crypto-related incidents in 2024, despite a 15% drop in stolen funds compared to the previous year. November alone saw over $71 million in digital assets vanish, bringing the year-to-date total to over $1.48 billion across 209 incidents. Crypto losses in October vs. November 2024.

WazirX (WRX) price jumped to a high of $0.3500, its highest level since March 14, and 255% above the lowest point this year. This rally happened as the developers made an update about the ongoing legal issues following its hack in July. In a statement, the developer said that they had applied with the Singapore High Court to convene a scheme meeting. This will be a crucial step towards final distributions since it offers the fastest recovery solution, is fair and equitable for all creditors, and is legally binding. The distributions will be made within ten working days after the scheme is approved by creditors and the court in Singapore. The WazirX price also jumped after the developers sent an update about asset rebalancing. They noted that they were in the process of rebalancing tokens in its exchange. This will be an important step towards the final allocations to cold wallets. All these events happened a few months after WazirX, which was then a big crypto exchange, was hacked. Hackers drained over $235 million in what has been viewed as an inside job by some crypto analysts. Police in Delhi arrested a person suspected of carrying out the hack. Cryptocurrency tokens of troubled companies like Celsius, Safemoon, and FTX Token often jump when there is a major legal progress. You might also like: Inside job or cover-up?

It then pared some of these gains, moving to a low of $0.30. It has formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages flipped each other. WazirX token also moved to the extreme overshoot level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. It is also slowly forming a cup and handle pattern whose upper side is at $0.3947, which is about 34% above the current level. Therefore, the WRX price will likely continue rising if bulls flip the extreme overshoot point at $0.35. A drop below the strong pivot reverse point at $0.20 will invalidate the bullish view.

37594127,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392958,1734110259,Looking For The Next 100X Crypto? 3 Altcoins Revealed To Replicate BTC’s Success,"The post Looking For The Next 100X Crypto? 3 Altcoins Revealed To Replicate BTC’s Success appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News With Bitcoin breaking $100k for the first time, the entire crypto market is in a bullish phase. Now, investors are looking at tokens that can replicate Bitcoin’s past growth. Solana, WIF and a new MemeFi token, Cutoshi are among those with the biggest potential. Solana Set For $600 In 2025? Currently trading at $208.94, Solana (SOL) has seen a significant correction from its all-time high of $260 in November. This correction erased its monthly gains, with Solana losing 1% of its value over the last 30 days. Despite its latest correction, Solana is still up 188.02% over the last year. What is more, SOL proved it could reach new ATHs, surpassing its November 2021 level. What is more, its expansive ecosystem and scalable infrastructure suggest that more growth is on the way. This is why some analysts put Solana’s price at $600 in 2025. CoinCX puts its price range between $380 and $450 for the beginning of 2025. Before reaching $500, however, the token will likely experience a correction. Still, despite a bullish long-term outlook, Solana is not looking so good in the near term. Daily technicals are pointing to a bearish outlook , especially the short-moving averages. Weekly moving averages, however, are still bullish, with all the key moving averages below Solana’s current price. WIF Set For Major Returns Like most meme coins, the Solana-based DogWifHat (WIF) was hit by the recent price correction. On December 10, WIF crashed 17.28% to $2.79 in just one day, reflecting similar declines by other memecoins. However, the token still has a strong medium-term outlook. The recent bull market has largely seen meme coin underperform utility tokens. For one, this is because memecoins had their bull run in March. The explosion of Solana-based tokens on Pump.fun helped further boost the sentiment. This was when WIF achieved its all-time high of $4.85. Still, memecoins may yet experience a bull run once traders roll over their profits from utility tokens. This is when tokens like WIF are likely to shine again. In three months, CoinCodex puts WIF’s price target at $ 9.81. Looking at a more recent outlook, overall technical indicators for WIF are still strong. While short-term moving averages for WIF are turning bearish, others are still below WIF’s current price. Can Viral MemeFi Token Cutoshi Increase 100x? The bull market is bringing new traders into the market and one token is taking full advantage of this. Unlike Solana and WIF, memeFi Cutoshi (CUTO) was shielded from the recent retracement. This is because the token is still in its presale phase, which is showing wildly successful. By December 10, Cutoshi raised over $1.36 million in presale investment. This is significant, as this is just weeks after its launch, indicating strong investor interest. What is driving interest in Cutoshi is its unique blend of memes and DeFi. Cutoshi is a memecoin, but it’s also building a decentralized ecosystem that wants to bring as many people as possible to DeFi. With a dedicated multichain DEX and a learning platform to onboard new users, this utility is attracting traders. With regular memecoins losing out this cycle, Cutoshi is in a unique position to use its DeFi utility to attract both users and investors.

They say Coinbase unfairly delisted WBTC in order to highlight its own competing product, cbBTC. On November 19, Coinbase announced that it planned to delist wBTC from its platform starting December 19, 2024. The decision was attributed to a periodic review of listing standards. The timing coincided with a restructuring of the wBTC ecosystem, with BitGo, the asset’s longtime custodian, transferring partial control to BiT Global Trust, a Hong Kong-based organization with ties to Justin Sun and the Tron blockchain. This partnership has raised suspicions within the crypto community, leading major decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like MakerDAO and Aave to consider using wBTC as collateral, but neither has taken action. Launched in 2019, WBTC remains the largest tokenized version of Bitcoin with a market cap of over $13.4 billion, surpassing alternatives like renBTC and iBTC. Under the new governance structure, BitGo oversees wBTC operations, while BiT Global Trust serves as the custodian for the Bitcoin backing the token. Control of wBTC’s collateral is now split between three entities: BitGo, BiT Global Trust, and a BiT Global subsidiary in Singapore, each of which owns one of the multi-signature keys. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of BiT Global by law firm Kneupper & Covey, accuses Coinbase of anti-competitive behavior. The lawsuit alleges that Coinbase’s actions violate state and federal laws and could harm BiT Global’s business. “We believe this decision sets a terrible precedent for everyone in the crypto space,” attorney Kevin Kneupper said in a statement. Coinbase responded to the allegations, saying: “Coinbase is committed to maintaining the high integrity of our listing standards and we regularly evaluate assets listed on our platform. If an asset fails to meet these standards, it is delisted.” *This is not investment advice.

Buyers are becoming impatient, seeking a quick rise above this steady range. This has triggered significant buying interest from large investors, potentially leading to an increase in long positions for Dogecoin. Whales Begin Accumulation Process Dogecoin’s value has surged 500% since its lows in August, with a 220% increase following Donald Trump’s presidential election win in November. Currently, the cryptocurrency is experiencing a phase of consolidation around $0.4. Data from Coinglass reveals that Dogecoin witnessed a total liquidation of nearly $7.5 million in the last 24 hours, out of which buyers liquidated around $6 million worth of long positions. Messari data reveals that addresses holding at least 1 million DOGE now possess a total of 130 billion DOGE, reaching a record high. This increase in holdings by large investors suggests a robust confidence in Dogecoin’s potential for growth. Data from IntoTheBlock shows a gradual increase in the DOGE’s large transaction volume. It shows that the metric surged from the low of $6.1 billion to $23.3 billion over the last 72 hours. This shows a rising demand from whales as Dogecoin takes a halt around the $0.4 mark. Despite the bullish sentiment among large investors, their demand has not succeeded in lifting Dogecoin from its consolidation pattern, as the memecoin continues to struggle. Experts suggest that broader market trends will play a role in whether DOGE can hold a breakout above the $0.5 mark. Also read: Dogecoin (DOGE) Poised For 20% Price Drop if This Happens Elon Musk’s significant influence continues to be a crucial factor in Dogecoin’s market trends and appeal to major investors. His frequent endorsements via Twitter during the 2020-2021 rally significantly contributed to its sharp price increases. Recently, a similar momentum boost has come with the introduction of the Department of Government Efficiency, humorously abbreviated as DOGE. This nod to Dogecoin’s ticker symbol has triggered significant interest in the leading memecoin. What’s Next for DOGE Price? Dogecoin price is attempting to surge above the consolidation of $0.4. Bulls are actively working to drive the price back into the resistance zone around $0.5. However, bears are strongly defending a surge above EMA trend lines. As of writing, DOGE price trades at $0.405, surging over 0.2% in the last 24 hours. A successful break above the EMA50 trend line on the 4-hour chart would indicate that the initial rejection might have been a bear trap, potentially pushing the DOGE/USDT pair to $0.48. At this level, sellers are expected to strongly defend. Conversely, this bullish scenario will be invalidated if the price falls and breaks below $0.36, increasing the risk of a decline to the 50-day simple moving average at $0.31. This level is crucial for bulls to hold to prevent further losses. As the RSI level is holding below the buying level, we might see a minor downward pressure before a robust rebound.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BUSINESS | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/dogecoin-prepares-for-a-10-bullish-surge-as-buyers-lose-patience-with-0-4-consolidation-what-to-expect-next/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listings-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Binance Records $24 Billion Net Inflow Amid Growing User Base and Institutional Interest This achievement underscores Binance’s position as a dominant player in the crypto ecosystem, supported by the global increase in institutional investments and digital asset adoption. Key Drivers Behind Binance’s Growth Binance attributes its inflows to a variety of factors, including: Regulatory developments: The exchange pointed to regulatory gains in key markets. Market milestones: Historic price benchmarks and the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, Hong Kong, and other major financial centers. Expanding user base: Binance’s global user base has reached nearly 250 million users, driven by the growing interest in digital assets. Binance signaled that it continues to lead the industry by stating that its inflows exceeded the combined total of 10 rival exchanges. Industry Comparisons According to DefiLlama, Binance’s net inflow of $24.2 billion outpaces its competitors: Bybit: $8.2 billion OKX: $5.3 billion Other exchanges like BitMEX, Robinhood, and HTX reported inflows of $3.45 billion, $3.165 billion, and $2.12 billion, respectively. However, some major players like Coinbase and Gemini were not included in DefiLlama’s list due to lack of wallet transparency or proof-of-reserve reporting.

The trader was speculating with the $RICH memecoin on Solana ( SOL ), losing 325.8 SOL in two poorly executed trades. Lookonchain reported the case on December 13, which is a cautionary tale for crypto traders to avoid letting emotion dominate. In summary, the speculator deployed 495 SOL in two trades to end up with 169.5 SOL. Interestingly, SOL was changing hands by nearly $227 at the time of this trading, as shown in SolScan . Therefore, this crypto trader has effectively turned around $112,000 into $38,000 in three minutes, booking a massive loss. Solana address BBgwD3eSnQHvhESbeozdTP9G2DcqB4wFgxeP4dADFuud.

The address ‘ BBgw(…)Fuud ’ spent 198 SOL in two transactions of 99 SOL each to buy 4.17 million RICH. However, the memecoin continued crashing, dropping 60% more from his buying order, making the trader panic-sell its position with losses. This first trade returned him 76 SOL in exchange for the 4.17 million RICH, losing 122 SOL tokens. Right after selling it, RICH bounced back the 60% crash, causing ‘BBgw(…)Fuud’ to buy with fear of missing out ( FOMO ), deploying even more money in this second trade. This time, there were three transactions of 99 SOL each, totaling 297 SOL for 8.7 million RICH. Yet, once again, it was a market trap, finding price resistance that sent the memecoin lower. The negative price action following his second purchase again triggered the trader to capitulate and sell the tokens with losses. ‘BBgw(…)Fuud’ received 93.5 SOL in exchange for the 8.7 million RICH, losing an additional 203.5 SOL.

37593938,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98832,1734109823,Sleeping Giant? Shiba Inu Price Poised for Sixfold Boost as Trillions Of SHIB Flow Into Whale Wallets,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme coin by market cap, may soon awaken, according to popular cryptocurrency analyst Zach Humphries. In a recent YouTube video posted Friday, Humphries expressed his optimism about SHIB’s potential, predicting a five- to six-fold price surge if current market dynamics align. Notably, Humphries, an influential voice within the Shiba Inu community, began by highlighting the growing momentum surrounding SHIB, emphasizing its connection to Ethereum’s ecosystem. He further pointed out that Shiba Inu, ranked 13th by market cap, is positioned to capitalize on Ethereum’s growth as its ecosystem gains traction. “Shib and Pepe are primed and ready to go. I think it’s coming… Ethereum is starting to show signs… it’s quiet right now, but it won’t be quiet for very long,” He noted . Focusing on SHIB’s technicals, the pundit discussed breaking through the $0.00002960 resistance level. According to him, this would trigger a bullish rally that could push SHIB’s price higher, with a potential sixfold gain if Ethereum climbs to the $7,000–$8,000 range. “If SHIB breaks that $0.2960 level, look out… we could start to make another push back into the mid-threes,” he stated, adding “I think as long as eth gets to seven to $8,000, we’re probably getting a you know 10x out of PEPE and probably a five to six out of SHIB minimum.” The sentiment among other analysts aligns with Humphries’ enthusiasm. Pouyan, a TradingView analyst, highlighted a critical multi-year trendline resistance in the SHIB’s weekly price chart, noting that breaking it could result in a 150% price increase, with a target of $0.000074. However, he cautioned that failure to breach this resistance might lead to a drop toward $0.000011. Bolstering this optimism, on-chain data from IntoTheBlock shows a sharp 82% rise in SHIB’s Large Holders Netflow within the past day, with 2.4 trillion SHIB worth around $72 million flowing into whale wallets. This surge often indicates reduced selling pressure, paving the way for upward momentum. SHIB’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), currently at 61, reinforces the bullish outlook, suggesting the asset is not overbought and still has room to rise past the 70 threshold. As long as SHIB holds above the key multi-year support at $0.000020, a break above the March 2024 high of $0.000045 seems likely, potentially triggering an explosive rally .

With a year-to-date gain of over 70%, Ethereum has strengthened its position as a key player in the cryptocurrency market. Driven by record ETF inflows, network upgrades, and growing institutional interest, Ethereum’s recent rise has sparked fresh discussions about its future. As 2024 nears its end, investors are closely watching to see where the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency heads next. Ethereum year-to-date price chart. Source: Finbold ETF inflows signal robust institutional confidence One of the major catalysts for Ethereum’s recent momentum has been the renewed investor appetite for U.S.-listed spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds . BlackRock’s (NYSE: BLK ), iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA), and Fidelity’s FETH ETF have led the surge, with both funds collectively purchasing $500 million worth of Ether earlier this week, according to Arkham Intelligence. For instance, ETHA has recorded inflows for ten consecutive days, bringing its total to $3.2 billion since its inception, according to Farside Investors . As of December 12, Ethereum-based ETFs have collectively attracted over $2 billion in inflows since their launch in July, despite $3.52 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) during the same period. This highlights the growing institutional confidence in Ethereum, reinforcing its position as a leading digital asset and a favored investment vehicle. On-chain activity supports the bullish narrative Ethereum’s on-chain metrics reflect robust growth, particularly on Layer 1 (L1), where daily transactions now average 6.5 to 7.5 million, up from 5 million in 2023, according to CryptoQuant . This increase has driven higher network fees, resulting in more Ethereum being burned under its fee-burning mechanism. Binance Research attributes this surge to Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap, which shifts computational execution to Layer 2 (L2) solutions while retaining Layer 1’s role in data availability and security. A major catalyst was the March 2024 Dencun upgrade , which introduced “blobs” to reduce Layer 1 fees and allow L2s to process higher transaction volumes. This upgrade has significantly improved network efficiency and boosted activity. However, the lower Layer 1 fees have impacted Ethereum’s burn rate, pushing the network toward an inflationary state. While this shift has tempered enthusiasm among some investors, experts view it as a temporary effect of scaling upgrades that expanded blockspace supply faster than demand. Despite these challenges, Ethereum’s issuance rate remains below 1%, much lower than rival blockchains, suggesting deflationary trends could resume as demand recovers. Ethereum outshines Bitcoin in post-election rally Following the U.S. elections, Ethereum has consistently outperformed Bitcoin ( BTC ), with the ETH/BTC ratio climbing above 0.4. This trend reflects a growing preference for Ethereum as traders favor ETH in options markets. Bybit’s December 5 Volatility Review further highlights this shift, noting a stronger bullish sentiment in ETH options pricing compared to Bitcoin. Adding to this momentum, a wallet linked to Trump-backed World Liberty Financial has been accumulating $ETH, alongside a few other crypto assets, with purchases exceeding $5 million. This activity has pushed the wallet’s total crypto holdings to over $72 million, further underscoring the increasing institutional confidence in Ethereum as a key digital asset. ChatGPT’s Ethereum price outlook for December 31, 2024 Based on a confluence of factors, including strong ETF inflows, heightened on-chain activity, and robust institutional demand, ChatGPT projects that Ethereum could reach $5,000 by December 31, 2024.

(Your Weekly Crypto Recap)","It hasn’t been a particularly fun week in the cryptocurrency industry as the majority of the market is trading in the red. The losses are mostly tolerable, although some altcoins definitely feel the pressure. But let’s start with Bitcoin, as always. The primary cryptocurrency saw a week full of volatility. During the weekend, it increased above $101,000 but as soon as the week started, things weren’t going as smoothly. On Monday, the price began to fall, and at one point, it even dipped toward $94,000. You guessed it – at that point, half of the community was calling the bull market off. But the actual bulls had something else in mind, as the dip was bought up almost immediately within the next couple of days. The price shot up toward $103K yesterday but was unable to sustain itself there, and Bitcoin is currently battling for the coveted $100K level once again. Elsewhere, if you thought that a week would go by without Michael Saylor not buying BTC, well, think again. MicroStrategy announced yet another massive purchase, this time worth around $2.1 billion. They bought 21,550 BTC at an average price of $98,782 and currently holds a whopping 423,650 BTC. That’s right, every time Bitcoin moves by a single dollar, the company makes or loses almost half a million bucks. Now, that’s wild. BlackRock also chipped in on the party. Experts from the company said that allocating 2% of one’s multi-asset portfolio to Bitcoin is a “reasonable” margin. But why would you care? Well, these guys manage a lot of money. In fact, they manage the most money compared to other asset managers, and when they say something – people tend to listen. In this case, other institutional investors might consider Bitcoin after BlackRock is publicly endorsing it yet again. All in all, the week was very interesting in terms of price action, but if you hold altcoins, some of your portfolio is likely tanking. Most of them are in the red. A lot of the losses aren’t that substantial, but there are some exceptions. Now, another interesting thing to look into is the possibility of a Christmas rally. Here are a few points in favor of this: The Fed is expected to cut rates again. Bitcoin’s supply cycle is in mid-swing, straight up. The EOY sales bump. Pro-Bitcoin Republicans soon take over Washington. Market Data Market Cap: $3.81T | 24H Vol: $264B | BTC Dominance: 52.5% BTC: $101,136 (+1.2%) | ETH: $3,932 ( -2% ) | XRP: $2.43 (+4%) This Week’s Headlines You Can’t Miss Bitcoin ETFs Hit $50.5B in Cumulative Net Inflows in First Year.

MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Stash Rises to 423,650 BTC After Another Multi-Billion Dollar Purchase. It seems like a recurring event now, but MicroStrategy, the world’s largest corporate holder of BTC, has announced another massive acquisition. This time, the firm spent $2.1 billion at an average price of $98,782 to acquire 21,550 BTC. Ray Dalio Says to Invest in BTC and Gold, Not Debt Assets: Report.

Charles Hoskinson Reveals Cardano’s Roadmap to Full Decentralization in 2025,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and the network’s firm IOHK, has unveiled an ambitious roadmap to achieve full decentralization of Cardano by the end of 2025. In a YouTube session on Thursday, Hoskinson reflected on the recently concluded Constitutional Convention in Argentina, highlighting the global collaboration involving over 50 countries, which marked a pivotal step toward community governance. He further expressed pride in the convention’s success, culminating in 95% of delegates agreeing on a guiding document for Cardano’s future after years of workshops and community engagement. “ It was probably one of the proudest moments of my professional career,” he stated , emphasizing the event’s global inclusivity, with participation spanning all six continents. He addressed the tension within the Cardano ecosystem regarding differing visions for achieving decentralization, advocating for a system where all key roles are elected by the community and guided by on-chain mechanisms and constitutional law. Notably, the pundit dismissed non-democratic governance models as unwarranted, comparing them to the bureaucratic inefficiencies seen in modern governments. He also voiced concerns about the potential emergence of self-serving institutions if Cardano’s governance does not fully embrace democratization. “For my part, I always believe that the key is to build member-based institutions and on-chain governance and get them working well together,” he explained. Looking ahead, Hoskinson emphasized the necessity of decentralizing Cardano’s governance while acknowledging the challenges involved, heading into next year. “In 2025, we have some challenges, and those challenges are going to be that we have to fully decentralize the governance of Cardano,” Hoskinson emphasized. According to him, the journey shall begin in January with the full activation of Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP) 1694, designed to enhance governance discussions. Next, the community will work toward ratifying Cardano’s on-chain Constitution, establishing an annual budget process, and, ultimately, the election of the entire constitutional committee by the community. Hoskinson then highlighted that he, IOHK, and his company would step back from direct governance roles, allowing the community to take full control of Cardano’s direction. “I’m fully prepared for any necessary restructuring in 2025 to take any role in the ecosystem because this is not about Charles Hoskinson or IOHK,” he stated. That said, Hoskinson concluded by outlining his commitments for the year, which include developing new projects on Cardano to drive its growth, ensuring the community’s voice is heard in governance, and engaging with the broader crypto industry in the U.S. to push for favorable legislation. “We are this close to greatness,” he said, urging the community to look beyond personal or organizational disputes to achieve a vision where Cardano not only survives but thrives as a decentralized entity.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | REGULATION | SPONSORED,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ada-super-rocket-charles-hoskinson-reveals-cardanos-roadmap-to-full-decentralization-in-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

The Colorado-based Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining company announced the fresh acquisitions on Dec. 13, noting that the purchase follows its $525 million convertible bond issue. On Dec. 11, Riot announced a $500 million convertible notes offering, which then upsized to an additional $75 million. The company’s latest BTC purchase is the proceeds of this issuance — a 5,117 BTC haul netted at the average price of $99,669 per bitcoin. With the “MicroStrategy” playbook now a major part of several companies looking to have Bitcoin on their treasury, one of the industry players taking this by storm is Riot Platforms. You might also like: Bitcoin ETF inflows surge over 160% as total inflows surpass $35b Riot holds $1.68 billion in BTC So far, the mining company has increased its total BTC holdings to 16,728. The value of these assets, as per the latest BTC price, is roughly $1.68 billion. It’s a notable bump in Riot’s holdings, given the company held 10,928 BTC at the end of October 2024. Part of the growth before the latest purchase includes the 505 BTC Riot mined in October , having sold none of its haul in the two months prior. Riot’s bullish outlook for BTC mirrors that of several other publicly traded companies. Hong Kong-listed Boyaa Interactive recently converted its Ethereum ( ETH ) holdings to BTC, a move that saw it flip Japanese investment firm Metaplanet as “Asia’s MicroStrategy.” Metaplanet has, however, been a prolific buyer of the flagship cryptocurrency, which analysts expect will rise to $200k in 2025 amid catalysts such as national governments’ push for Bitcoin strategic reserves. Miner Marathon Digital has also adopted a Bitcoin strategy. Other companies taking this route are Thumzup, China’s SOS Limited and Genius Group. MicroStrategy is the world’s largest holder of BTC, with over 423,650 BTC, which was acquired for approximately $25.6 billion. Earlier this week, shareholders of tech giant Microsoft down-voted a proposal that sought to have it add Bitcoin to its treasury. However, observers say this might only be for the short-term.

37593616,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662306,1734109206,December’s Top Crypto Picks: 8 Coins That Could Make You Rich,"Christmas is fast approaching, and if you want to hopefully give yourself something to ho ho ho about, then how about investing in some top crypto coins? Or give someone else the gift of a meme coin since nothing says Christmas more than a coin with a frog’s head on it. In that spirit, here are eight strong up-and-coming coins that could potentially make you rich in 2025. However, we can’t make guarantees, only predictions. So only invest what you can afford to lose. 1. Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) is a new meme coin that’s due to launch in just a week’s time. It has massive hype behind it – with 15 million tokens sold already in its presale stage – as well as a compelling use case in the form of the MemeVault. The MemeVault will give investors a unified platform to buy meme coins such as Pepe, Dogecoin, Shibu Inu, and Floki Inu — essentially streamlining meme coin transactions. Built on the ERC-1155 standard, it will also allow multi-chain, multi-token staking, all of which gives $STARS a very compelling case for long-term potential. With a current price per token of $0.0016782, a current staking APY of 175%, and a slick marketing campaign by its developers, $STARS is projected to do extremely well when it exits the presale stage next week. 2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Bucking trends, tearing up the rule book, and giving Wall Street a run for its money seems to be the trend right now, which is likely why Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) is also doing extremely bullishly. Wall Street Pepe aims to turn the tables on big investors by giving smaller investors access to the same information and opportunities in what’s been termed a “Frog Army.” Aiming to capitalize on the huge popularity of Pepe the Frog, Wall Street Pepe is currently offering a very attractive $0.0003634 per coin, but the price is increasing every few days, so now’s the time to jump in and make a hopeful killing. With almost $14 million raised so far, as well as catching the eye of Elon Musk , $WEPE has the mileage to go far and do well. Especially with huge transactions like this one coming in. 3. Catslap ($SLAP) With a weird name and a slap-to-earn game thrown in for extra profit, well….you’d be forgiven for thinking that Catslap ($SLAP) is somebody’s idea of a bad joke. But far from it. With a current token price of $0.00679474 and a staking APY of 40%, $SLAP has rocketed more than 4,000% in value during the last week. The slap-to-earn game has $100,000 set aside for the top ten winners on the leaderboard, so there’s certainly plenty of liquidity available in the project. Curious about how the game works? Basically, you ‘slap’ the meme, and the more you slap, the more $SLAP you earn. Along the way, Catslap will burn the promised number of coins to the top ‘Slappers.’ The developers hope that all of these features and the hype surrounding Catslap will propel the token price past $0.01, which would be a very nice return on your slapping investment. 4. Flockerz ($FLOCK) If you’re regularly watching new meme coins like we are, you’ll notice there’s a consistent pattern – they all seem to be named after animals. Pepe the Frog, a slapping cat, and now blue Flockerz ($FLOCK) birds. Let’s hope you’re all animal lovers. Every new meme coin has a unique selling point, and what sets $FLOCK apart is giving token owners voting rights over the platform’s future direction. So, by giving each token holder a say in how $FLOCK is run, they’re introducing a one-of-a-kind vote-to-earn feature. $FLOCK absolutely has the potential to set up your “nest” egg with a current token price of $0.0063754 and a staking APY of 436%. But there are only two days until the end of the presale, so if you want to lock in that lower price and big “early-bird” staking rewards, then now is the time to act. 5. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) If you’d rather move away from aggressive cats, weird-looking frogs, and bluebirds, then Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is a promising-looking coin to consider adding to your crypto portfolio. $BEST is the token connected to the Best Wallet App , and when they’re combined, the developers behind the project hope to offer lower transaction fees and higher token staking. Along with a Best Card to encourage transactions on the Best Wallet and giving token holders the opportunity to get involved in promising presales, $BEST is betting that these useful functions give $BEST a long-term game plan, which will encourage investors to support it. The current token price is $0.023125, but the price goes up tomorrow. With a current staking APY of 671%, buying today instead of tomorrow could make a big difference in your crypto balance. 6. AAVE ($AAVE) The AAVE ($AAVE) coin got a bit of a boost this week when rumors started circulating about World Liberty Financial – US President-Elect Donald Trump’s crypto firm – allegedly making an investment of $1M . This has pushed AAVE’s price up more than 40% in the past week to a current value of around $370 a token. The price has dipped slightly in the past couple of days, but that seems to be indicative of an industry-wide trend and not because of one coin. 7. Chainlink ($LINK) Chainlink ($LINK) is another cryptocurrency that got a $1M investment boost from Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial. And despite a slight dip a couple of days ago, it seems to be recovering and heading steadily upwards. It’s now sitting pretty at just over 20% overall growth in the past 7 days, with a current token value of $28. Like Best Wallet ($BEST), Chainlink is introducing its own token to go along with the decentralized blockchain network that it operates. Chainlink connects smart contracts to real-world data and APIs by giving them secure, tamper-proof data feeds. 8. BitGet ($BGB) We end with BitGet ($BGB), which is really performing strongly at the moment, with bullish investor confidence estimated to be at 85%. And no wonder – in the last week alone, it’s seen 34% overall growth, with each token worth a very affordable $3.17. In the past year, growth has been over 550% and investors are speculating that it could reach $5 -$10 per token by the end of December. There have been slight dips, and that’s to be expected with any investment opportunity. But with investor confidence so high, the future prospects of Bitget seem to be very bright. Remember though – there can never be any guarantees on making money on crypto investments. We can only make expert predictions. You must now do your own research and make your own independent decisions. It’s Good Times For Crypto The crypto market is currently booming. Bitcoin hit the $100K mark and that bodes well for other scrappy and promising cryptocurrencies. An extremely pro-crypto president is entering the White House next month with plans to loosen the regulations on crypto markets. All of the coins on this list are recommended by us, but the first two – $STARS and $WEPE – are our top picks because of their real-world use cases. But to emphasize once again, we can only make predictions, not guarantees. Always do your own research and make your own decisions.",POSITIVE,AAVE | LINK | BGB,AAVE | BUSINESS | LINK | TRADING | BGB,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/top-crypto-coins-that-could-make-you-rich/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

For instance, Amonyx has predicted that Ripple (XRP) could reach $20 soon. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) now sees bullish indicators suggesting it is primed for a big surge. Investors are also going wild about a new exchange token now in phase six of its presale – DTX Exchange (DTX) . Although still early in development, this rookie has already given early buyers a 500% return while raising over $10M. Since DTX Exchange looks poised to become a fan-favorite in the online trading space, many experts foresee the value of this altcoin potentially soaring by 7,000% in 2025. Amonyx: The Price of Ripple (XRP) May Soar to $20 Soon Recently, Amonyx made headlines in the crypto space with his Ripple (XRP) price prediction. In a new X post, he told his followers that this altcoin could reach $20 soon. Although many people found this Ripple price prediction outlandish, XRP has been rising lately. According to CoinMarketCap, the Ripple price jumped from around $0.70 to nearly $3 in the past 30 days. In other words, Ripple (XRP) saw a price surge of over 250% in just a few short weeks. The technicals for the Ripple crypto are also showing some positive signs. TradingView data points to this altcoin trading above its 10-day EMA ($2.33) and 20-day EMA ($2.08). Thanks to these factors, traders consider Ripple one of the altcoins to watch. Solana (SOL) Shows Bullish Indicators Amid Price Growth Solana (SOL) is another crypto coin showing some growth. On the one-month chart, the Solana price increased nearly 5%, per CoinMarketCap. During that time, its value moved between almost $220 and over $230. TradingView data points to Solana crypto continuing this bullish momentum. At this time, this altcoin is trading above its 10-day EMA ($229) and its 30-day EMA ($225). Plus, the momentum indicator for Solana sits at 6.50, which is in the buy zone and suggests an upswing. Market analyst Inmortal also excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his recent X post, Solana (SOL) could skyrocket past $440 soon. Therefore, Solana solidifies its position as one of the top 10 altcoins. DTX Exchange (DTX) Looks Positioned for Massive Price Growth DTX Exchange (DTX) is a trailblazing trading platform that could dominate online trading. It will merge the benefits of CEX and DEX and take the trader experience to the next level. The platform will allow the user to trade in global markets from the convenience of one single interface. With DTX Exchange, traders will get access to: Over 120K Asset Classes: The ability to trade crypto coins, stocks, gold, etc. Privacy: No sign-up KYC checks will be required. Up to 1,000x Leverage: High leverage on assets means more reward potential while minimizing risk. Currently valued at $0.12 in phase six of its presale, the DTX token has already shown great growth potential. This is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. Once a Tier-1 crypto exchange lists this token, many traders will be happy to know its listing price will sit at $0.20 – a 66% return for all who buy it now. This growth could make DTX one of the best cryptos to buy now. What May Come for Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) & DTX Exchange (DTX)? Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), and DTX Exchange (DTX) look poised to see big price gains. However, DTX has some advantages that could set it apart. This rookie will have a smaller market cap than its peers while tapping into the growing $18T gold market. Therefore, DTX may need less money for its price to surge while being more stable in the long run. Because of this, experts predict a potential 7,000% growth for this altcoin in 2025.

Cronos wants to become a bigger player in DeFi, blockchain gaming and also in artificial intelligence agents, which it believes will play a crucial role in growing the adoption of Web3. AI agents are autonomous systems that can automate various tasks on behalf of their users with minimal human intervention. Examples might include an AI agent that manages someone’s crypto investments, automatically rebalancing their portfolio according to market shifts. AI agents have taken centre stage on the Cronos roadmap due to their potential to catalyze mainstream adoption of Web3. Its developers believe that whatever network can best support AI agents will become a key player in the next wave of AI innovation. The anticipated surge of AI agent activity across Cronos is what sparked the necessity for the Pallene, and it should significantly enhance its ability to support those workloads. Pallene is all about increasing Cronos’ ability to scale, and it does so in a dramatic way, speeding up transaction execution by 600-times. The key enabler of this is Cronos’ Block-STM technology, which facilitates parallel transaction processing, so the network can squeeze many more transactions into a single block. Another critical feature introduced by Pallene is the ability to perform optimistic execution via Cosmos SDK 0.50. This helps to streamline block processing while making the network more responsive, the developers say. The Cronos Pallene upgrade also enhanced its cross-chain capabilities, thanks to an update to the Inter-Blockchain Communication or IBC protocol. It facilitates communication between Cronos and IBC-compatible networks, as well as ERC-20 chains. Ken Timsit, the managing director of Cronos, hailed the update as a “defining milestone”, giving it the ability to scale to meet the expected demands of future, AI-powered blockchain applications. It’s effectively become future-proof, he said. “The blockchain’s virtual machine can now execute up to 60,000 transactions per second in parallel,” Timsit explained. He added that the next step for his team will be to “remove any remaining bottlenecks at the networking layer”, in order to support the mass adoption of AI agents. There’s a lot of buzz in the crypto market. For example, analyst XO predicts a price target of $300 for Solana (SOL). Furthermore, based on the bullish technical indicators, Cardano (ADA) has started showing promising growth signs. Despite all this, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself as one of the best new ICOs. This presale, now in phase six, has already seen a 500% price surge. Given its potential to dominate the online trading space and tap into the growing $1.4T FX market, experts remain bullish on it. Some even foresee a 5x growth potential for this altcoin in 2025. XO: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Reach $300 Soon Solana (SOL) is seeing some green price charts right now. CoinMarketCap shows that this altcoin saw a price surge of over 5% in the past 30 days, jumping from around $200 to over $250. Crypto analyst XO excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this altcoin will see a big jump if it holds the low $200s as support. XO forecasts a potential surge to $300 for Solana (SOL) soon. The technicals show some good signs for the Solana crypto. For example, TradingView shows that its value is above its 50-day EMA ($213). Furthermore, its momentum indicator is at -20, which is in the buy zone and suggests this uptrend may continue. Cardano (ADA) Technicals Remain Bullish As Price Rises Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin that is riding a bullish wave. On the one-month chart, the price of Cardano increased from around $0.50 to over $1. In other words, its value skyrocketed over 70% as per CoinMarketCap. The technical analysis for Cardano (ADA) is also bullish. According to TradingView, this crypto currency is trading above its 30-day EMA ($0.95) and its momentum indicator sits at -0.06 which is in the buy zone. Therefore, the Cardano coin may continue this bullish trajectory. Market expert Valeriya remains optimistic about Cardano as well. In her new X post, she stated that a $1.20 or even $1.25 bounce is still possible. This Cardano price prediction captures traders’ attention. DTX Exchange (DTX) Excites Traders With a 500% Surge So Far DTX Exchange (DTX) is a hot altcoin right now. Whoever bought it at the beginning of its crypto ICO event has already received 500% returns. With the addition of a listing on CoinMarketCap, countless traders are now rushing to buy DTX. This token will power the DTX Exchange platform. On this hybrid trading platform, people will get: ● Access to over 120K asset classes like gold, FX, and crypto coins. ● Transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds. ● Privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. On the other hand, those who hold the DTX token will get governance voting rights as well as a portion of the trading fee revenue made by the DTX Exchange. This has led to millions of DTX tokens being sold. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, this presale price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven begins. Additionally, its expected launch price sits at $0.20, which is a 66% jump from its current price. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Soar Like Solana (SOL) & Cardano (ADA)? While Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are on a rally right now, some analysts are also bullish for DTX Exchange (DTX) . This newcomer will have ties to many trillion-dollar markets and a smaller market cap. Therefore, DTX could need less money for its price to rise over time. Because of this, experts foresee a potential 5x growth for this altcoin in 2025.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | EXCHANGE | SOL | TRADING | CRO,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/information/cronos-rolls-accelerated-transaction-processing-to-support-emerging-ai-agents/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Lead investors Galaxy Digital, ParaFi Capital and Dragonfly were joined by more than 40 investment firms including Anthony Scaramucci’s SkyBridge Capital and AI/crypto investment firm Morgan Creek Digital. The raise comes shortly after the launch of the Avalanche9000 testnet. According to the tweeted announcement, the upcoming Avalanche9000 upgrade “represents a pivotal step toward advancing the decentralized finance ecosystem.” The network will deploy the Avalanche9000 mainnet on Monday, December 16. Avalanche claims it “will reduce Avalanche L1 deployment costs by 99.9%, as well as reducing transaction costs on the established C-Chain by 25X.” To give an example of the post-upgrade price difference. Currently, to validate Avalanche, you need an upfront payment of 2,000 AVAX, which, at around $50 today, is a costly venture upward of $100,000. This will be reduced to a monthly subscription-style fee of 1.33 AVAX. Avalanche announces a $250 million private locked-token sale led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital, highlighting the growing confidence in Avalanche’s blockchain ecosystem ahead of the Avalanche9000 upgrade https://t.co/tWmn5u9LbG — Avalanche9000 (@avax) December 12, 2024 Avalanche’s fundraise comes in spite of the blockchain already having $3 billion in its treasury. In a Forbes interview , CEO and founder Emin Gün Sirer claims it wasn’t about money, but “to get alignment and incentivize the right kinds of partners to build with.” Ultimately, Avalanche9000 aims to give its home-chain multi-chain capabilities. As Sirer said in the same interview: “A single chain cannot cater to all use cases, no matter how fast you make it. The only winning architecture is multi-chain.” Also, Avalanche entered the world of tokenized RWA as a major player, bringing funds from BlackRock, Franklin Templeton and ParaFi Capital on chain. However, the company and its CEO face stark allegations of weaponizing the US legal system to bring down opponents, deploying vast bot armies to pump $AVAX and centralized and opaque practises that go against the ethos of crypto. From Avalanche to Crypto All-Stars: How Altcoin Fever is Driving Christmas Crypto Sales. Avalanche’s investment news means $AVAX rallied 1.5% overnight against Bitcoin’s 0.7% dip. While most coins tend to track the performance of Bitcoin, as we head into the festive season, much of crypto’s recent investment activity has centred on alternative coins, or “altcoins”. Over in Web3, one new meme coin presale has suddenly blown up, raising around $2 million in the last 24 hours alone. Meme coin fans are piling into Crypto All-Stars as it is on track to becoming one of the biggest meme coin launches this year. It is changing the negative perceptions around meme coins by enabling crypto fans to put their digital funny tokens to work and generate yield. See, pop the hood of this revolutionary new multi-chain meme coin staking ecosystem and you’ll find the innovative MemeVault protocol and its native $STARS token, which together enable meme coin fans to lock up their tokens and start generating passive income. Users can stake Pepe Coin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, Floki Inu, Brett, MogCoin, Milady, TurboToken, Toshi The Cat, Coq Inu, and BonkCoin in the MemeVault to earn passive income. The current reward rate for staking these coins is an impressive 174% in the form of $STARS. Following the purchase, investors can begin staking for rewards and claim the tokens once the presale ends. Meme coin investors better hurry, though. Only a week remains to buy into Web3’s most useful meme coin. Head to the website to buy $STARS with ETH, USDT, BNB, or even by card.

Elsewhere in the space, iDEGEN —an AI agent raised from scratch by crypto Twitter—has now raised over $4.2 million in its FOMO-frenzy presale, with degens aping into the most unhinged social experiment crypto has seen to date. AI memes are ripping across the board right now, and iDEGEN offers early, discounted access to one that looks primed to rule the roost when it lists in 2025. Fartcoin: First-mover advantage Fartcoin is one of the tokens that kicked off the insane AI memecoin run that has taken the crypto world by storm, with the sector now worth over $4 billion since beginning in earnest just a couple of months back. ToT came up with the idea for Fartcoin itself, after which somebody spun up the token on Pump.fun, and it immediately rose to a market cap in the tens of millions. Now, though, things have kicked up a gear, with a 325% rally in the last month taking FARTCOIN to the $500 million mark. Fartcoin now joins the likes Goatseus Maximums, ai16z, Zerebro, and Act I: The Prophecy, which have all hit the half-billy landmark, solidifying the AI meme coin sector as one of the most dominant players in this meme coin supercycle. As the wider meme market trudges towards a $1 trillion valuation by cycle top, expect this asset class to lead the way in gains. iDEGEN: The AI meme coin heir apparent Among the swathes of AI memes jostling for position, one stands apart: iDEGEN , the home of crypto’s wildest social experiment. This AI agent is totally unlike any others—Eliza, Zerebro, and ToT don’t even come close—in that it was created without guardrails, or any normal training data. The training data here is the crypto community itself. That’s right: there are no nerds in lab coats telling this agent how to act, and its parents are CT’s finest degens. It’s already gone majorly viral, with the chance to shape AI history pulling in scores of degens whose every tweet must be responded to by iDEGEN. This led the project to trend on X in both the US and the UK yesterday, and has brought an astonishing $4.2 million into the project before it’s even hit the public market. The IDGN presale operates on an adaptive auction model, where prices adjust in real-time according to demand. Think of this as a warm-up for true open market price discovery: it proves that real demand is already sky high, so just imagine what could happen to the price of this groundbreaking token when it lists on DEXs in January. Time is running out: IDGN lists in January With the January DEX listing date fast approaching, the window to get early access to a future king of crypto’s most viral sector is slipping away. AI meme coins are here to stay, and are arguably the most important narrative in crypto right now—this is where the big movers are, and those moves are only getting bigger, as evidenced by Fartcoin’s new all-time highs. iDEGEN offers a completely new take on the format—exactly the kind of take that could send it into orbit. With $4.2 million already in the bag, iDEGEN is rapidly approaching escape velocity, and you can’t afford to be priced out when this bad boy really takes off.

In a follow-up post on its official website, Gate.io condemned the spread of misinformation on social platforms. He warned that it would pursue legal action against those responsible for spreading fake news. The Ripple Effect of Fake News in Crypto Misinformation in the crypto world is a growing issue . Fake news has caused major disruptions, with several exchanges and industry leaders becoming the target of baseless rumors. In 2022, rumors surrounding Binance’s financial instability prompted a surge of withdrawals, causing temporary market panic. Similarly, in 2021, rumors of a potential government crackdown on crypto exchanges in China triggered massive market sell-offs, with Bitcoin and other altcoins plunging in value. Another example occurred early this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) X account was hacked. The hackers posted fake news about the SEC approving a Bitcoin ETF , temporarily spiking Bitcoin prices. These instances highlight how the crypto market is highly susceptible to the effects of misinformation. Rumors about hacks, fraud, or insolvency often lead to panic selling, massive withdrawals, and overall market destabilization. This shows how harmful false claims can be to platforms and users in an industry where trust and transparency are crucial. The Role of Industry Leaders in Combating Misinformation Leading figures in the crypto industry have a significant responsibility to combat misinformation and help maintain stability. Binance’s CEO Changpeng CZ Zhao has often taken to social media to address rumors quickly and set the record straight. His quick responses and reassurances have often helped calm panic during market uncertainty. Similarly, Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has often advocated for greater transparency in the crypto industry. He mentioned that rumors will continue to thrive without clear and accurate communication. By speaking directly to the community, Buterin and other leaders aim to set a tone of trust essential for the crypto ecosystem to thrive. However, fighting fake news is not just up to industry leaders. It takes effort from everyone, including exchanges, regulators, and users, to address misinformation and keep the market trustworthy quickly.

Hedera has numerous catalysts that may push its price higher, as some analysts expect. One of these analysts, All In Crypto , believes that HBAR price has room to jump to $1 in this bullish cycle. He cited its technicals, especially a double-bottom pattern, to predict this move.

Valour Funds, a large firm with over $1 billion in assets, filed for a Hedera physical staking exchange-traded product on Euronext, a move that will lead to more adoption by institutional investors. Just last month, Canary Capital filed for a spot on HBAR ETF with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There is a chance that the ETF will be approved since the agency is set to go through major changes when Gary Gensler steps down . Hedera Hashgraph is also seeing traction in its decentralized finance ecosystem. Data shows that the total value locked has jumped to a record high of almost $200 million, much higher than January’s low of $53 million. The biggest players in the ecosystem are Stader, SaucerSwap, and Bonzo Finance. HBAR is also seeing strong demand in the futures market, where futures open interest rose to over $326 million. Open interest is a metric that looks at the open call and puts options trades in the futures market.

More upside will be confirmed if the price rallies above the year-to-date high of $0.3900. If this happens, the next point to watch will be at $0.5690, the all-time high. A move above that level will point to more gains, possibly to $1.

Here’s What We Know,"Satoshi Hamada has proposed the creation of a strategic Bitcoin Reserve in Japan. Hamada wants Japan to emulate Donald Trump’s Bitcoin plan in the U.S. The politician wants Japan to convert part of its foreign reserve into crypto. A Japanese politician, Satoshi Hamada, has proposed that the government establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, mirroring a similar policy promised by Donald Trump in the United States.

37592981,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627168,1734107591,Polygon community evaluating proposal to use over $1 billion in stablecoin reserves – What to expect,"The Polygon community is evaluating a proposal to deploy over $1 billion in stablecoin reserves from the Polygon PoS bridge. DeFi protocols Morpho, Yearn, and Web3 risk provider Allez Labs presented the proposal seeking views from the polygon community. Allez Labs, Morpho, and Yearn collaborated on a community-led Pre-PIP (pre-Polygon improvement Proposal) to use dormant stablecoins to gain yield. The PoS bridge reportedly holds reserves of USDT, DAI, and USDC. Polygon community considers the proposal to deploy stablecoins held in reserves According to the Pre-PIP authors, deploying the stablecoin reserves into curated liquidity pools would kickstart an ecosystem incentives program to grow Polygon PoS and AggLayer DeFi ecosystems. The authors recommended combining their expertise and industry technology to help the Polygon community establish the program. They also outlined the details of the deployment in the proposal. The industry players suggested gradually deploying bridge liquidity for the stablecoins into an ERC-4626 vault. Each asset in the program was proposed to be activated by an independent PIP. They suggested Morpho Vaults and Markets would serve as the underlying liquidity protocol, while Allez Labs would serve as the system’s risk manager. According to the proposal, USDT and USDC would use Morpho Vaults as a yield source due to the absence of native yield-bearing wrappers. The authors added DAI reserves would be held in Maker’s sUSDS vault. It was also proposed that USTB from Superstate, sUSDS from Maker, and stUSD from Angle would serve as DeFi yield-bearing collaterals and high-quality RWA. The authors also proposed Yearn would serve as the system’s reward manager. Proposal’s authors suggest deployment could unlock yields for the network The authors suggested the idle funds would gain a yield of over $70 million per year at the current lending rates. They expressed their belief in Polygon’s maturity and the assets reserved on the Polygon PoS bridge could now be securely utilized. Paul Frambot, co-founder and CEO of Morpho Labs, commented that the stablecoins held represented a $50-90 million opportunity at current lending rates. He also reiterated the proposed measures could incentivize a new ecosystem that would establish Polygon as a sustainable DeFi innovation leader. Polygon has $1.3B in unproductive stablecoins in the PoS bridge. That’s $50-90M in potential yield at current rates. The proposal: deposit idle stablecoins into a Morpho Vault and redistribute the yield to Polygon’s DeFi ecosystem—kickstarting a flywheel. Why Morpho: – Full… https://t.co/qrhYClB6JT — Paul Frambot | Morpho (@PaulFrambot) December 12, 2024 Crypto Texan, the DeFi Growth lead at Polygon, speculated that using the stablecoins through the proposed vaults would generate over $90 million in yields annually. The PIP authors highlighted that all decisions on increasing risk, such as adding new markets and increasing market caps, would be behind a 72-hour time lock. They noted the Polygon Protocol Council would retain a veto through their guardian role. The authors expressed the goal of ensuring there were no backward compatibility concerns since all Bridge APIs remained unchanged. However, they warned that the gas amount used in certain bridging calls may increase in the execution of the new proposal. Polygon announced its migration from its MATIC token to the new POL token in September 2024. The migration was reportedly initiated after a proposal from the Polygon community. The company said the migration aimed to enhance the token’s functionality. The migration was part of the company’s roadmap, “Polygon 2.0” announced last year. According to Polygon, the roadmap aims to improve the network’s capabilities. The company clarified the new token would not replace MATIC but would only become central to advanced functions to be launched in the near future.

37592597,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662117,1734107431,BONK Struggles To Sustain Gains As Selling Pressure Mounts,"BONK finds itself under increasing selling pressure as its recent rally falters, raising concerns about the token’s ability to sustain its upward momentum. Struggling to maintain its gains, the price has started a fresh drop toward the $0.00002962 key support level, indicating a possible bearish continuation. This pivotal zone is under scrutiny as a failure to hold could trigger further downward movement, amplifying pessimistic sentiment. Such a scenario may lead to heightened volatility, with participants watching for either signs of a recovery or indications of a deeper correction. Technical Indicators Point To Potential Decline BONK is currently trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key technical indicator that gauges market sentiment changes. This positioning below the SMA typically signals a bearish outlook as it indicates that the average price over the past 100 days is lower than the current price. Related Reading: BONK Finds Stability At $0.00004002, Can Bulls Spark A Comeback? The fact that BONK is trading below the 100-day SMA raises concerns about the strength of its recent rally and suggests that selling pressure is currently outweighing buying interest, with prices poised for further losses. With the market sentiment turning negative, there is a high risk of continued declines unless a significant reversal occurs. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has begun to drop again after previously reaching the 50% threshold. Specifically, the decline in the RSI indicator signals a potential weakening of bullish momentum, suggesting that buying pressure is fading. Typically, the RSI’s movement toward lower levels implies that market sentiment may be becoming more cautious with the increase in the risk of bearish action. As the RSI moves away from the neutral zone, it could signal growing selling pressure, reinforcing the potential for a deeper pullback in BONK’s price. Selling Pressure Intensifies: How Low Can BONK Go? Selling pressure on BONK has been mounting, leading to a decline in its price as the recent rally fizzles out. With the token trading below the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing signs of weakening momentum, the outlook for BONK is increasingly bearish. Related Reading: Is BONK Rally In Jeopardy? Technical Indicators Confirm Weakness If the selling pressure persists, the price could continue to drop, possibly testing key support levels like $0.00002962. A sustained break below this level could cause further losses, with the next target being the $0.00002320 support level. However, if the meme coin experiences a rebound at $0.00002962, it could initiate a fresh climb toward the $0.00004002 mark. Successfully breaking above this resistance might shift the momentum, potentially triggering a rally beyond the 100-day SMA and targeting the $0.00006247 resistance level.

Finally, Donald Trump's transition team is looking for ways to significantly downsize, merge or eliminate key bank regulators. Trump's team and officials from the newly formed Office of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are exploring merging or eliminating agencies such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) as part of the upcoming major banking reform, the Wall Street Journal reported. Trump's team reportedly asked candidates being considered for the FDIC and OCC whether deposit insurance could be included in the Treasury Department. Although Trump's team has sought to eliminate some agencies, it has been noted that a proposal to eliminate the FDIC or any agency would require Congressional approval. While some experts support his planned moves against institutions like the FDIC, others argue that FDIC-backed deposit insurance is important for financial stability and warn that removing such institutions could hurt the overall banking sector. On the other hand, the crypto industry applauds Trump’s proposal to eliminate the FDIC and thus his efforts to reduce restrictive banking policies. “Eliminating the FDIC would bring us one step closer to ending the weaponization of the U.S. banking system and preventing Operation Choke Point from ever happening again,” said Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini exchange. *This is not investment advice.

This setup allowed for the direct exchange of digital securities and central bank digital currency. The process tested the potential of blockchain technology to facilitate interbank refinancing. By handling both securities and currency on blockchain, the transaction explored efficiencies in liquidity management and settlement processes. Societe Generale’s subsidiary, SG-FORGE, was responsible for executing the transaction. The unit specializes in digital asset operations and contributed technical expertise to integrate blockchain-based assets with traditional banking frameworks. “This transaction demonstrates the technical feasibility of interbank refinancing operations directly on blockchain. It illustrates the potential of a Central Bank Digital Currency to improve the liquidity of digital financial securities,” the release reads.

Bybit’s main motivation for this move is to comply with the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Focus on MiCA Licensing in Austria Bybit is actively pursuing a MiCA license in Austria, which is a key step in its compliance-first approach. The license will allow Bybit to operate under the strict European regulatory requirements. Ben Zhou , co-founder and CEO of Bybit, believes that obtaining the MiCA license will be a major strategic milestone for Bybit, and will also allow the exchange to exceed the expectations of both regulators and its users before compliance becomes a problem. Temporary Adjustments to EEA Operations To ensure full compliance with the MiCA regulations, particularly the reverse solicitation principle, Bybit temporarily stopped all general communications with EEA users. While this adjustment limits certain activities, existing customers still have uninterrupted access to their crypto assets. The company also assured its users that this measure is only temporary and to avoid any regulatory breaches. Bybit stated that it will re-engage with the EEA market once it secures the MiCA license. Additionally, the company is actively collaborating with regulatory authorities to make the licensing process as quick and painless as possible.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market dips, major players like BlackRock and analysts remain bullish, accumulating Cardano, Avalanche, and newcomer Cutoshi for their breakout potential. Table of Contents Is Cardano preparing for a breakout year? Why AVAX is central to BlackRock’s tokenization strategy Cutoshi’s presale raises over $1.3m As the crypto market experiences a flash crash, big players and analysts such as BlackRock and Ali Martinez are loading up on coins like Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX) and Cutoshi (CUTO). Is Cardano preparing for a breakout year? After years of slow development in comparison to the many blockchains, Cardano has been on a tear, until the recent flash crash. But popular trader Ali Martinez is still bullish on ADA due to technical analysis, and says “#Cardano is doing the same as it did in 2020, which is why I’m buying! Even if it dips down to $0.76, I’m buying more and plan to book profits between $4 and $6.” The two major changes for ADA this year are the upcoming change in US administration, since ADA will not be classified as a security. Another boost came from Cardano’s integration with BitcoinOS. A smart contract system expanding Bitcoin’s capabilities by connecting it to platforms like Cardano. This allows for secure and private interactions using ZK technology. Which brings much-needed cross-chain functionality and gets rid of the need for traditional bridges, improving scalability and efficiency. Why AVAX is central to BlackRock’s tokenization strategy Avalanche failed to hold the $50 resistance level and is now trading at $44, which some traders, like Martinez, see as a potential buying opportunity. But the real whales in Avalanche right now are interested in BlackRock’s launch of the Digital Liquidity Fund BUIDL, using Securitize. This move is due to asset managers like BlackRock being very bullish around the tokenization of real world assets, something which the BUIDL fund makes possible on Avalanche. BlackRock is creating its own stablecoin on Avalanche. Each BUIDL token represents one share of $500M+, a fund designed to maintain a stable value of $1 per token. Investors receive daily dividends directly in their wallets, with the Fund allocating 100% of its assets to cash, U.S. Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. This setup lets investors earn yield on fiat or stablecoins that might otherwise sit idle. On Avalanche, the fund offers much lower fees compared to other blockchains where it’s available, making it an attractive option for cost-conscious investors. Professor Mike from Binance says that AVAX could be headed for a $300 price point in 2025, based on various analysis points.

However, that hasn’t stopped the whales from piling in, as the project has raised $1.35 million in less than two months, a clear sign that traders are bullish on its potential. Cutoshi recently completed its $2,000 meme competition, which showcased the creativity of its growing community and its focus on user engagement. The project has trended three times so far on X, proving that the Chinese Lucky Cat branding with a DeFi twist resonates with the crypto crowd. The whitepaper outlines ambitious plans, starting with a cross-chain DEX designed to simplify on-chain trading. It also includes features like P2P transactions for users who value privacy and a learning academy aimed at onboarding newcomers into DeFi. Cutoshi is currently in Stage 4 of its presale, tokens are priced at $0.031, marking a 100% gain from the initial price. Over 20% of the stage is already sold out. With a low market cap of $13m, Cutoshi has significant room for growth.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price.

French Hill focused on flexible crypto market and IPO rules,"Representative French Hill, the next House Financial Services Committee chair, foreshadowed crypto policy pain points to focus on under the next U.S. administration. Republican pro-crypto U.S. Representative French Hill will steer the House Committee toward relaxing banking regulation, standardizing crypto market structure, and improving capital formation to incentivize more companies to go public. Rep. Hill shared these ideas during a CNBC interview just hours after beating fellow Republicans in a race to become the next House Finance Services Committee chair. The Committee has been vocal about digital asset regulation, emphasizing the need to axe policy ambiguity and introduce clear rules. Under outgoing chair, Representative Patrick McHenry, the Committee pushed through proposals like the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. You might also like: Rep.

FIT 21 was subject to Senator markups, and debates about the bill’s merits still abound. Hill also commented on calls for a national strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. Drumbeats in favor of a BTC stockpile grew louder in the Senate and across State Houses. Texas introduced legislation on Dex. 12 to this effect, while jurisdictions like Alabama and Pennsylvania could soon produce Bitcoin reserve proposals. Despite the nationwide fever pitch around the idea, Rep. Hill reportedly said he’s unsure if the U.S. should create a Bitcoin reserve. Hill’s doubt contrasted promises from President-elect Donald Trump and the BITCOIN Bill tabled by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis.

37591907,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627145,1734105679,Broadcom stock rallied on strong Q1 FY2025 AI projections,"Broadcom stock recorded a 13% surge in premarket trading on Friday supported by solid AI projections for the first quarter of 2025 as well as on the back of strong fourth-quarter earnings performance. The company is projecting its revenue for Q1 FY2025 to reach $14.6 billion representing a 22% jump year-over-year, while the AI segment is expected to continue on a growth trajectory. The segment should see a revenue increase of around 65% to $3.8 billion. Broadcom sees AI semiconductor business outgrowing other segments Broadcom also anticipates maintaining a leading position in the semiconductor market. Commenting on the firm’s performance and its projections, CEO Hock Tan underscored the company’s strategic AI focus. “The reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor business will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business.” – Tan Tan also emphasized the company’s strong customer relationships. “We are very well positioned, well on the way to creating a multiyear roadmap for our customers,” said Tan. During its earnings call, analysts also asked about the AI market opportunity with particular reference to Broadcom’s engagement with hyperscale customers. The company indicated that networking content within AI is expected to increase significantly, while it also highlighted an open approach to mergers and acquisitions. Despite the strong AI projections, it might not be all rosy for the semiconductor firm. There are some potential risks to watch out for such as potential volatility in the semiconductor market, given its cyclical nature. The company also faces competitive pressure in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. According to Investing.com , Broadcom faces macro-economic uncertainties that could have an impact on demand, and integration challenges post VMware acquisition. AI supported Broadcom’s Q4 performance The company recorded a 4.1% revenue growth to $9.3 billion year-over-year beating Wall Street projections. According to the company, the robust earnings performance is reflective of growing demand for its semiconductor solutions, especially in networking and AI accelerators. Network revenues jumped 23% year-over-year to close the quarter at $3.1 billion, which represented 42% of the company’s semiconductor revenue. Tan remained upbeat about the role of AI in the firm’s performance and projects revenue opportunities of between $60 billion and $90 billion by fiscal year 2027, further cementing the company’s commitment to expand its AI offerings . His projections of an AI-driven growth trajectory are also in line with the growing adoption of AI technology across the globe as industries embrace it for its transformative abilities. During the period under review, Broadcom recorded $1.5 billion in revenue from generative AI, which accounted for 20% of semiconductor sales. Advanced networking products, including custom AI accelerators and connectivity solutions, have positioned it as a key supplier to hyperscale data centers and cloud providers. According to Reuters , demand for the firm’s chips that help move large amounts of data that is used by applications such as ChatGPT has also surged, as businesses double down on investments in GenAI infrastructure. “Broadcom’s strong performance doesn’t come as a surprise. It’s one of several companies benefiting from AI invigorating the global semiconductor industry, with its AI revenue growing 220% this year.” – eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne Some analysts are, however, downbeat and expressed doubts about the amount of future business from Apple, which is one of Broadcom’s most significant wireless customers. This comes as Apple is working on designing more of its chips in-house and planning to switch to a homegrown chip for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections starting next year. This will replace some parts that Broadcom currently supplies. Although Broadcom faces intense competition from Nvidia’s ethernet-like Infiniband products, Broadcom still benefits from the expansion of AI data centers as it is one of the largest providers of advanced networking equipment. “Broadcom will continue to be a relevant player in the custom AI ASIC market together with companies like Marvell as tier-1 hyperscalers will continue to introduce their in-house chips,” Summit Insights senior analyst Kinngai Chan said.

What are Crypto Presales? Crypto presales, often referred to as ICOs (initial coin offerings), are usually the first time retail investors can buy tokens, also allowing them to secure digital assets before the token is listed on crypto exchanges. A limited number of investors can purchase the token before it is offered to the wider public and during a presale, crypto tokens are likely to be sold at a highly discounted price – often via the platform’s website. This is done not only to raise funds for development but to increase hype and interest around a newly launched project. Once the token is listed on an exchange, its price might go up. The investor can choose to sell the coin immediately for a profit, or they can continue holding the token and hope that the price continues to climb higher. Ultimately, the strategy will depend on the project and the risk appetite of the investor. In addition to this, some projects reward early investors with premium memberships, additional tokens, and access to exclusive features. Crypto presales can be private or public event, depending on the project. Some upcoming platforms require interested investors to register in advance to gain access to a crypto presale. On the other hand, there are also crypto presales that are accessible to the general public. How to Find the Best Crypto Presales to Invest in 2024 Cryptocurrencies no longer struggle in the backwaters of finance. Some of the best crypto winter tokens have shown resilience amidst the current market volatility. But with the majority of investors sharing a bearish sentiment, many people are looking for the best cryptos to buy during the bear market. Today, digital assets have become part of the mainstream markets, and as such, there are many new digital tokens being launched every month. From an investment perspective, this means more opportunities. However, at the same time, it is crucial to know how to evaluate new crypto projects to determine whether the token is worth buying or not. Here are some factors that can help investors identify the best crypto presales in 2024: Know Where to Look The first thing to consider is where to look in order to find the upcoming cryptocurrency presales. While guides like ours can help, investors should also expand their research to other platforms to learn more about new digital tokens. This includes: Crypto aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko Dedicated crypto presale sites like CoinSniper, Pinksale, ICO Drops Social media websites like Twitter and Facebook Online forums such as Reddit and Quora Since crypto presales happen before ICO and IDO listings, investors might not be able to find them via exchanges. Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to monitor crypto-related platforms in order to see what new digital tokens are coming online. Research the Project The absence of quantifiable data makes it challenging to determine if a new crypto project is worth investing in or not. After all, there are plenty of crypto scams out there. This is why research plays a crucial role in every investment decision. After creating a shortlist of the best crypto presales to invest in, it would be wise to do an analysis of what the project is about. Start by reading the whitepaper of the project, which reveals information such as the platform’s objectives, strategies, and plans for the future. On top of this, it would also be wise to take a look at the roadmap and see when the project aims to execute the different milestones. If a presale crypto project does not have a whitepaper or a roadmap, this is a red flag that investors should not want to overlook. That being said, not every project with a whitepaper represents a good choice. Instead, investors should consider what the unique value proposition of the project is and why it would make a compelling opportunity. Look Into the Development Team The team behind a crypto project is one of the important aspects that will determine its longevity. In a nutshell, the best projects have experienced team members who are knowledgeable about the respective industry. For instance, for play-to-earn projects, it would make sense that the team members are familiar with blockchain technology as well as GameFi concepts. Meme coins are often founded by anonymous developers, so it is even more important investors look at other parts of the project to ensure they are legitimate – such as the smart token audit, utility and tokenomics. Review the Tokenomics A project’s tokenomics informs investors about the total token supply, and how much of the supply is distributed for exchange listings, the presale, project team, etc. When searching for the best crypto presales, the tokenomics of the project should also be paid attention to. While many crypto presales start with a hard cap of billions of tokens, the majority of projects burn coins after the project launches. This ‘deflationary’ system can reduce the supply, thus driving up the token’s value – in theory at least. Ultimately, investors should try to learn everything they can about a new crypto project before risking any money. Focus on Social Media Today, social media platforms and online forums have the power to make or break a cryptocurrency. The case of Dogecoin is a perfect example of this. The price of this token was boosted by Elon Musk’s tweets alongside discussions on subreddits. Given this, social media can easily be considered a valuable source that can help investors spot the next cryptocurrency to explore. However, investors should not blindly follow such forums. It is essential to do background research in order to understand the viability of the project. Furthermore, social media follower numbers can easily be manipulated – whether through buying large accounts or using spam bots – so tracking things like post engagement is also important. Spot Developing Trends It is vitally important that investors keep up with the latest trends and the news cycle as that can lead to huge returns in the market. Crypto, like any other asset class, goes through cycles of interest and in the early years it was the capability of blockchains, then DeFi products, then layer 2s. During the last bull run Web3 gaming, metaverse and NFT-related projects made huge gains. So far in 2024, artificial intelligence has been dominating the news cycle and AI-related coins have been among the top gainers and another emerging trend could see the most hype in the next bull run. How We Chose The Best Crypto Presales TheCoinrise regularly updates the top presales list above and adjusts their order depending on the following rating criteria: Current market trends – as mentioned above, some of the most trending crypto narratives and asset classes are artificial intelligence, meme coins, crypto mining, GambleFi, and the launch of a spot Bitcoin ETF How early a presale is in its roadmap – it’s often advantageous to invest early if there are incremental token price increases that afford the earliest investors a discount and an initial ROI at launch Staking rewards – in some cases new projects offer a high annual percentage yield (APY) that allows early buyers to compound their returns Team information and audit – having a doxxed founding team and completing a smart contract audit with a reputable company lends credibility to a new crypto presale For example, assets like Bitcoin Minetrix may gain additional traction from the Bitcoin ETF narrative, and Meme Kombat has a public project lead. Both are audited presales with staking rewards, and $MK incorporates AI elements. Is it a Good Idea to Invest in Crypto Presales? As with any other investment, crypto presales come with benefits as well as risks. Below, we have outlined a few reasons why investors might want to consider investing in the best crypto presales of this year: High Price Potential Since presales are conducted ahead of the ICO, tokens will be sold at a discounted price. This places early investors at an instant advantage – as they will be able to purchase coins at a lower price and potentially sell them for a profit once the token is listed on an exchange. And in case the project grows, the token’s value might appreciate more. On top of this, due to the low price on offer – the investor will also have the option of purchasing a larger stock of coins at launch. Earn Passive Income It is also becoming common for crypto projects to reward early investors with passive income. This can come in many forms. For instance, it has become common for crypto projects to offer status rewards to investors – which distributes tax collected via transactions. So, when trying to identify the best crypto presale to invest in, it might be worth it to check out the additional perks offered by the project and the scope to generate passive income. Get Early Investor Advantage Another advantage is that investors can get in on the ground level of a unique idea before it becomes mainstream. For instance, when Dogecoin was launched, the concept of meme coins was still nascent. However, early investors were rewarded with significant gains several years down the line. Investing in a crypto project during its presale stage allows investors to become a part of the core community, giving them the opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals and foster a strong community. Risks of Crypto Presales While searching for the best crypto presale to invest in, it is imperative to consider the risks involved. If the chosen project fails, investors might find themselves owning worthless tokens. In addition to this, depending on wider market conditions, the value of the coins might decline rapidly after the ICO presale. This means that investors might not be able to make any profit from their investment. That is a risk that investors must consider when they are looking to reap the benefits of a crypto presale. How to Invest in Crypto Presales As we mentioned earlier in the guide, it is no easy feat to identify the best cryptocurrency sales. Although extensive lists of new presale coins are available on various websites, it takes time and research to weed out the very best. However, occasionally, some projects emerge to create a buzz in the market. Projects usually run presales on native websites before going listing on bigger exchanges, where they attract more awareness and liquidity. As an example, we outline below how to buy presale crypto tokens: Create MetaMask Wallet – To take part in the presale a non-custodial wallet is required. Both MetaMask and Trust Wallet are trustworthy providers. Buy ETH or USDT – Tokens can be purchased using ETH or USDT. These assets can be acquired from an exchange or directly via MetaMask. It’s important to remember gas fees during this process, and some ETH will be needed. Connect Wallet – Visit the crypto presale website. On the page, you can see the order box to start purchasing crypto presale tokens. Click ‘Connect Wallet’, and follow the on-screen instructions to connect the wallet to the presale. Purchase Tokens – Next, select the relevant ‘Buy Now’ option, decide how many tokens to purchase then and confirm the transaction. You will receive an equal number of crypto presale tokens, after confirming the purchase. Conclusion Presales provide investors with the opportunity to get in on the ground level of a promising new crypto project. They will also be able to benefit from discounted token prices, as well as additional incentives via staking and community rewards. Having said that, it can be challenging to find the best crypto presale to invest in, especially when there are dozens of new projects being launched every month. A degree of risk is involved as well when investing in new projects early in their roadmap. The best crypto presales right now is listed on our recommended crypto presales at the top of this article.

37593290,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319294,1734105519,73% of American Crypto Holders Plan to Reinvest in 2025: Kraken Survey,"A recent Kraken survey revealed 73% of American crypto holders plan to reinvest in 2025, showing confidence among existing investors. The study polled responses from 2,537 Americans and found many crypto holders planning to reinvest in 2025. US Citizens Finally Think Crypto Is Viable This indicates a shift towards viewing digital currencies as a viable financial tool. Of those surveyed, 43% believe crypto offers greater economic security than traditional banking. Another 52% consider it a strong long-term investment. The survey also shows that 55% of Americans, whether or not they own cryptocurrency, believe in the real-world utility of digital assets. However, 29% remain unsure about the sector’s future. While the survey highlights optimism, it also reveals persistent myths about blockchain technology. According to the findings, 60% of respondents think cryptocurrencies are primarily used for illegal activities. Gen X Is Crypto’s Main Audience In addition, the study reveals that Gen X shows the most trust in crypto among all age groups. This confidence might come from their experiences during two major economic crises: the 2008 Great Recession the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 These events likely reduced their trust in traditional currencies, which struggled against high inflation. This aligns with the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) survey showing over seven million UK adults own crypto assets. In contrast, according to the survey, Gen Z seems to trust crypto the least. Only 32% of people aged 18 to 29 think crypto is useful in everyday life. This may be because they are still learning how crypto works and having doubts about its future. Recent Challenges in Crypto Space Meanwhile, recent developments, such as Kraken’s $5.1 million fine by the Australian Federal Court for margin trading violations, highlight ongoing challenges in the crypto space. This case, involving loans to over 1,100 clients without proper suitability checks, has raised concerns about compliance but could ultimately lead to clearer global regulations, fostering more trust among investors.

37591552,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392944,1734105481,Bank of England Demands Firms to Disclose Crypto Asset Exposure by March 2025,"The post Bank of England Demands Firms to Disclose Crypto Asset Exposure by March 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a latest development, the Bank of England’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), has issued a directive that requires businesses to disclose their current and anticipated exposure to crypto assets by March 2025. This development comes as the UK evaluates the impact of virtual digital assets on its economy and financial systems. In a statement dated December 12, the PRA noted that this move aims to improve financial stability and shape the central bank’s approach to regulating the rapidly growing sector. Current and Future Crypto Exposure Notably, the regulator has asked firms to report their “current and expected future cryptoasset exposures” and to outline their application of the Basel framework, which is a regulatory standard introduced in December 2022 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to set capital and risk management requirements for crypto exposure. “This will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on crypto assets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures, [and] analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options,” the statement emphasized. Notably, the directive goes beyond current exposure, which requires firms to consider any future plans to engage with crypto assets until September 30, 2029. The PRA’s questionnaire spotlights several crucial areas of interest, like how firms are implementing the Basel framework and their use of permissionless blockchains. Concerns In Permissionless Blockchains The regulator voiced specific concerns about permissionless blockchains, mentioning risks like settlement failures, lack of settlement finality, and the absence of a guaranteed link between asset ownership and control of authentication mechanisms. While the PRA noted that, as of now, the risks associated with permissionless blockchains “cannot be sufficiently mitigated,” it acknowledged that this classification remains under review. This directive comes as more global firms increase their exposure to crypto assets, notably Bitcoin. For instance, on November 29, Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International moved nearly $50 million worth of Ether into Bitcoin. A day before, Metaplanet announced plans to raise over $62 million to purchase additional Bitcoin for its treasury, which already holds 1,142 Bitcoin valued at over $114 million.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/bank-of-england-demands-firms-to-disclose-crypto-asset-exposure-by-march-2025/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Ripple ( XRP ) was trading at $2.4 on Dec. 13, up by 28% above the lowest level this week, and a few points below the year-to-date high of $2.90. XRP price is forming a bullish flag The daily chart shows that Ripple is slowly forming a highly bullish pattern that may lead to a strong comeback in the next few days. It is forming a bullish flag pattern, which is characterized by a long vertical line and a rectangle-like formation. In this case, the flag started forming in late October and concluded in November. It has been forming the flag section since Dec. 2. In most periods, an asset tends to have a strong rebound when the flag pattern concludes. In XRP’s case, the breakout will be concluded when it rises above the descending channel. XRP also formed a hammer pattern on Dec. 10, whose lower side was at $1.9690, which was along the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement point. A hammer is made up of a long lower shadow and a small body, and is a popular bullish reversal pattern. There are also signs that Ripple is in the Elliot corrective wave, which follows the impulse wave. It has also remained above the 50-day and 100-day Exponential Moving Averages. Therefore, the XRP price has more room to run. A move above the upper side of the flag at $2.90 will confirm the bullish view. The first point to watch after that will be the psychological point at $3, followed by $5. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news Potential catalysts for Ripple Ripple faces numerous catalysts ahead. First, there are signs that XRP whales are accumulating the token. According to CryptoQuant, whale activity jumped to an all-time high, signaling that big investors have embraced it.

The developers have hinted that the stablecoin will be launched soon. While it is too early to determine whether it will be successful, the launch will likely attract hype from investors. Third, there is a chance that the XRP Ledger will start seeing traction among developers. Data shows that the network has over $63.5 million in assets , a figure that will keep growing. Further, and most importantly, Ripple will likely have an ETF now that Donald Trump has pledged to be a crypto-friendly president. All these factors could lead to more XRP price gains in the near term. Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

37591306,https://finbold.com/?p=219379,1734104927,"If you invested $1,000 in Dogecoin at the start of 2021, you’d have this much now","As attention-grabbing as Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rally to $100,000 and XRP’s above $2 was, various other tokens and meme coins have recorded stellar gains in 2024, with many rising well above their old highs. The original meme coin, Dogecoin ( DOGE ), both is and isn’t an exception to this rule. The dog-themed cryptocurrency’s yearly surge would have generated exceptional returns to any investor, albeit less than an early 2021 purchase, followed by a cashing out in May of the same year. Under the circumstances, even a relatively late DOGE investment made on January 1, 2021, would have generated a massive windfall by press time on December 13, so let’s break down the exact figures. The investment: $1,000 in DOGE on January 1, 2021 To begin with, Dogecoin was changing hands at the relatively low $0.005685 on January 1, 2021, while, by press time on December 13, 2024, DOGE price rocketed to $0.40381. Considering the price dynamic, $1,000 invested into the meme coin at the start of 2021 would have ensured ownership of 175,901 DOGE. Said Dogecoin would be worth $70,978 this Friday, December 13, signaling an overall rise of 7,003.08% and a total profit of nearly $70,000. As impressive as this performance is, traders who were savvy enough to spot the 2021 DOGE market top and sold in May could have – within mere months – turned $1,000 into an incredible $120,453. If the time frame is shortened to the current bull market , Dogecoin entered 2024 trading at the modest price of $0.09206, and the year-to-date (YTD) chart reveals an annual rally of 352.14%. This means a $1,000 investment made on New Year’s Day would have purchased just over 10,862 of the meme coin. At press time, the same number of Dogecoin would be worth an impressive $4,386. DOGE YTD price chart. Source: Finbold Finally, despite DOGE’s stellar performance – whether purchased at the start of 2021 or only in 2024 – data shows it would not have been the best meme coin to hold long-term. As Finbold calculated on December 12, 2024, a $1,000 investment in Shiba Inu ( SHIB ) made on January 1, 2021 would have grown to $172,888. What is next for Dogecoin investors? For investors who have already held on to Dogecoin for a long time, the prime question in late 2024 is likely whether it is worth keeping the meme coin in their portfolio. While there is no clear answer to such a question – though all investors who purchased after May 2021 and before November 2024 would probably be wise to take at least some of the profit – there is a strong sentiment in the cryptocurrency market that the bull cycle is still only at its beginning. Indeed, Dogecoin itself appears stable for the time being – though there is always some doubt if technical analysis ( TA ) even makes sense for such assets – as the relative strength index ( RSI ) at 55.23 shows it is neither ‘overbought’ nor ‘oversold.’ On the flip side, DOGE’s 17 green days out of the last 30 and overall optimistic investor sentiment serve as a testament to the strength of the recent rally and the confidence it will continue trading higher. Furthermore, it is important to say that broader market factors also hint at persistent strength. For example, Bitcoin – usually the trendsetter for digital assets – is, by press time, widely expected to rally at least another 150% in 2025 to $250,000 , indicating a broad uptrend.

While the digital asset spent most of 2024 either trading flatly or in a slight downtrend after a short move to the upside in March, the wider cryptocurrency bull market that ignited in November has seen DOGE prices skyrocket. To be fair, that is true of most of the leading cryptocurrencies — but DOGE has an additional advantage — Elon Musk’s long-term support for the coin, as well as his recent naming to the Department of Government Efficiency. By late November, Dogecoin was trading in the vicinity of 0.4188$ — at press time, the price of DOGE had receded to $0.4078, bringing year-to-date (YTD) returns to 195.71%. DOGE price YTD chart. Source: Finbold Some, like pseudonymous technical analyst Trader Tardigrade , claim that the bull run has just started . The asset has also shown quite impressive performance when compared with Bitcoin ( BTC ), as pointed out by crypto expert Ali Martinez. On the whole, analysts are quite bullish — and a recently published bit of analysis focusing on the volume of high-value traders further supports such a case. DOGE whales invest $160 million in 24 hours Over the last 24 hours, Dogecoin whales have bought $160 million worth of the meme coin, per a chart shared by Ali Martinez in a December 13 X post . In tandem with this, data from crypto behavior analysis platform Santiment has shown a notable decline in the mean dollar invested age when looking at DOGE. In simple terms, this indicates that older, stagnant wallets — particularly those with large holdings, are putting their coins back in circulation at an accelerated pace. DOGE whale purchase chart. Source: Ali Martinez on X Although the price of DOGE has actually declined by 4.37% over the last thirty days, this period of consolidation bears a striking resemblance to the cryptocurrency’s price action back in 2021. If these similarities continue to play out, based on Fibonacci retracement, Dogecoin could experience an 85% surge from current prices to reach prices as high as $0.75443 by January of 2025 per Martinez. DOGE Fibonacci retracement chart. Source: Bitcoinwallah on TradingView As the premier meme coin and the 7th largest cryptocurrency in the world, DOGE has inherent advantages compared to rivals and peers — and Musk’s long-term advocacy for the asset is only going to become a bigger bullish catalyst as Donald Trump’s presidency kicks off. Finally, this analysis isn’t even the most optimistic one — Trader Tardigrade also spotted a bull flag pattern on December 13. The consolidation period currently at play also fits the description of a bull flag — and in this case, if legitimate, DOGE prices could skyrocket to $2.15. #Dogecoin Bull Flag 🔥 Tight consolidation within Flag 👉 INTACT ✅ ✍️ A long Flagpole projects the target at $2.15 🚀 pic.twitter.com/rR6xyNZ94p — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) December 13, 2024 In any case, the asset seems primed for a renewed rally — the only question that remains is exactly how high it will go.

37591096,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627069,1734104479,"President Trump’s economic and diplomatic decisions are purely based on vibes, not national interests","Donald Trump’s economic playbook is chaos wrapped in contradiction. His decisions seem to thrive on unpredictability, leaving financial markets and global policymakers scrambling to make sense of them. Hedge funds, economists, and even his own advisers are left guessing as Trump’s policies oscillate between wild promises and actions that undercut them. Bridgewater recently warned its clients that Trump plans to “go big” in reshaping U.S. institutions, global trade, and foreign policy. Yet, they openly admitted their predictions are little more than educated guesses due to the lack of clarity around his plans. Investors are left to hedge their bets, bracing for whatever may come. Inflation and tariffs: A self-made dilemma One of the clearest contradictions in Trump’s policies is his stance on inflation and tariffs. During his campaign, he slammed the Biden administration for soaring inflation, promising to bring it under control. But his proposed 60% tariffs on Chinese imports and 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada could have the opposite effect. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned that the tariffs will “derail” the fight against inflation. Stephen Moore, one of Trump’s economic advisers, dismissed this concern, claiming there was no inflation spike during Trump’s first term despite higher tariffs. However, inflation is now at 2.7%, already above the Federal Reserve’s target. Goldman Sachs estimates Trump’s tariff plans could add another percentage point to inflation—before factoring in labor cost increases from mass deportations. The Federal Reserve and interest rate chaos Trump’s relationship with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been anything but smooth. While Trump recently pledged to keep Powell in his role, history suggests otherwise. He has repeatedly criticized Powell, even calling him an “idiot,” and pressured the Fed to lower interest rates during his first term. The stakes are higher now. Debt-servicing costs have surged, giving Trump more incentive to push for rate cuts. But Powell has consistently defended the Fed’s independence, leaving a potential standoff on the horizon. Trump’s team has flagged the U.S. dollar as overvalued, with Scott Bessent, his Treasury Secretary nominee, suggesting the need for a “grand global economic reordering” akin to the Bretton Woods agreement. Bessent even hinted at convening a G20 meeting to replicate the 1985 Plaza Accord. Bessent has admitted that two-thirds of tariff impacts typically manifest as currency gains, which would strengthen the dollar rather than weaken it. Most economists agree this scenario is likely, creating a paradox where Trump’s policies could work against his own goals. Trump’s approach to the trade deficit defies conventional economic wisdom. He plans to slash the deficit through political and commercial dominance. But the numbers tell a different story. During Trump’s first presidency, the U.S. trade deficit hit its highest level since 2008, rising from $481 billion to $679 billion. Source: Vlad Bastion Tariffs and a stronger dollar could exacerbate this issue, increasing imports instead of reducing them, especially if economic growth picks up. In just four years, U.S. debt has shot up by $11 trillion—that’s 40% of the country’s entire GDP. To put it in perspective, it took the U.S. 220 years to rack up its first $11 trillion in debt. The BRICS challenge Trump’s threats against the BRICS nations are another example of his shoot-from-the-hip diplomacy. Last month, he warned of sanctions if these countries pursued a shared currency to challenge the dollar. While the BRICS have no concrete plans for such a currency, Trump’s aggressive stance could backfire. While the dollar’s dominance is unlikely to wane anytime soon, Trump’s unpredictable use of U.S. power could accelerate the search for alternatives. Ironically, the very actions meant to protect the dollar could end up undermining it. How does Trump not see that? The president’s fiscal plans are another quagmire of contradictions. He has vowed to cut the federal deficit from 6.5% to 3% of GDP while simultaneously promising massive tax cuts. His team claims this gap will be filled by economic growth, government spending cuts, and tariff revenues. But analysts are skeptical. Even if some fiscal improvements occur, the scale of Trump’s promises seems unrealistic.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/president-trumps-economic-and-diplomatic-decisions-are-purely-based-on-vibes-not-national-interests/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37591096.jpeg

In an effort to maintain transparency and regulatory compliance, Bybit has announced that it is actively pursuing a Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCAR) license in Austria. With this license, Bybit will be eligible to offer secure and compliant services in the EEA that align with strict European standards. Compliance-based approach and the difficulty of the decision Ben Zhou, the co-founder and CEO of Bybit, commented on the decision: “Obtaining the MiCAR license will be a strategic milestone for Bybit. Our proactive stance ensures that we meet and exceed the expectations of both regulators and our users, as we work toward a future where innovation and compliance coexist seamlessly.” In order to avoid potential breaches of reverse solicitation rules, Bybit has made the difficult decision to cease communication with the EEA region for now. That said, existing users can still access their crypto assets without interruption. Bybit intends to resume the previous engagement in full once its compliance-first approach is reinstated and the MiCAR license is secured. Ben Zhou upheld the exchange’s stance on regulation: “As cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow globally, it is Bybit’s mission to deliver secure and reliable trading experiences underpinned by robust regulatory framework to all crypto communities.” He proceeded to explain the decision behind the adjustment: “To ensure we meet the highest standards and pave the way for a safer and more sustainable future for the industry, we’ve made the proactive decision to temporarily adjust our operations in the EEA. This allows us to focus on obtaining the necessary licenses and ensuring a fully compliant platform focused on serving EEA clients.” Commitment to the European market Finally, Bybit stated that they remain committed to their EEA clients and that the exchange actively engages with the regulatory authorities to streamline the licensing process and resume regional operations.

Trowbridge argues that decentralized computing is a critical missing piece for Web3 to reach its full potential. The vision of Web3 remains incomplete if it continues to depend on centralized cloud servers like Microsoft, AWS, Google Cloud, etc., undermining the principles of privacy, security, trust, and autonomy that decentralization promises. We recently interviewed Tom Trowbridge , Co-Founder at Fluence Labs, in person during Devconnect in Bangkok to understand what they're building in the decentralized infrastructure space. In this interview, we dive deeper into how decentralized computing is a fundamental component for the Web3 ecosystem to flourish. Generating Real Revenue is Important for DePIN Companies While crypto had traditionally been used for consensus algorithms or DeFi protocols, integrating it with physical infrastructure was an innovative concept that demanded its own terminology. DePIN's emergence emerged by the maturity of software and crypto-economics, honed and proven across various protocols. With respect to how users can get involved in the DePIN ecosystem , there are different angles to consider depending on whether you're a provider or an end customer. For example, as a provider, you can offer services like computing power, but you can also be a consumer, buying data and using the resources. This dual role fascinates many users, offering flexibility and a unique way to engage with the ecosystem. Trowbridge believes the most exciting aspect for users is generating revenue through decentralized platforms, with clear links between their contributions and economic rewards. It creates a sustainable model driven by the network's economics and does not rely on subsidies or temporary pricing. For example, it's a real deal when the ability to offer cloud infrastructure at a price almost 80% cheaper than centralized providers is offered. It is about creating an alternative to the centralized cloud that is economically viable and censorship-resistant. Fluence's core mission is to provide a decentralized cloud infrastructure 80% cheaper than traditional centralized cloud services while maintaining a sustainable economic model. Unlike other providers, Fluence's pricing structure is not temporary or subsidized—it is driven by the economics of the network. This leaves room for more affordable and reliable infrastructure for organizations without the risk of price manipulation or vendor lock-in. Fluence aims at the empowerment of enterprises as well as individual users by allowing them to build, scale, and monetize decentralized applications with increased security and efficiency. Therefore, Fluence stands for three key aspects: affordability, decentralization, and resistance to censorship. Challenges of Centralized v/s Decentralized Infrastructure While discussing the challenges associated with using DePIN infrastructure, Trowbridge shared a more evolved approach. He explained that in disputes or issues related to DePIN infrastructure, users interact directly with the compute providers via smart contracts and network protocols instead of relying on a centralized support team. Such processes ensure that users are billed only for resources used, and any issues over performance or allocation can be resolved by working directly with the provider. This is precisely where there is a need for decentralized infrastructure to evolve and provide a user experience that competes with AWS, Google, and Microsoft. While the experience with centralized cloud platforms is generally seamless, decentralized computing platforms like Fluence are still working on user interfaces and tooling to ensure ease of use. The user experience may be more complex initially, but it will improve as the developer community grows. Fluence seeks to make the shift from centralized to decentralized computing as smooth as possible as more enterprises and developers embrace decentralized computing. Over time, as the decentralized model evolves, it will offer businesses and enterprises a compelling alternative that can match the capabilities of traditional cloud providers. Fluence’s Upcoming Developments in the DePIN Landscape As for the broader trends in Web3 and the growing interest in technologies like DePIN, there is always the risk that specific trends may lose momentum, as we've seen with the rise and fall of NFTs, gaming, and other sectors. However, Fluence is focused on creating a sustainable infrastructure that can thrive regardless of market trends. As a strong use case for Web3, decentralized computing has an inherent long-term value beyond the hype cycles. Even as specific sectors may wax and wane in popularity, the need for decentralized, censorship-resistant infrastructure will only grow, driven by the increasing demand for privacy, security, and autonomy. Looking ahead, Trowbridge expressed his excitement that the Fluence infrastructure is gearing up for several key milestones, including the launch of Virtual Machines (VMs), scheduled for December. This significant development will enhance the platform's capabilities and attract a broader user base. The company also plans to announce its first customer use cases, demonstrating the real-world applications of its decentralized compute solutions. The third feature that adds excitement will be support for GPU-powered workloads, opening up new possibilities for AI and machine learning applications. Beyond DePIN, Trowbridge is also tapping broader market trends, such as the potential for Bitcoin reserves to gain traction among national governments. He said that if countries like the U.S. start holding Bitcoin as part of their strategic reserves, it could create a domino effect, encouraging other nations and large pension funds to adopt Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value.

37590837,https://crypto.news/?p=14319225,1734103982,"Trump considering FDIC rebuild, raising crypto industry hopes","The Wall Street Journal reported that incoming President Donald Trump’s transition team is exploring plans to alter or potentially eliminate the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. According to sources that spoke to the WSJ, Trump’s advisers have questioned candidates for regulatory positions on the feasibility of merging the FDIC with other agencies or absorbing its functions into the Treasury Department. These discussions are part of broader efforts under Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency to shrink federal oversight and streamline financial regulation. According to the WSJ, the talks also extend to merging or restructuring the FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and parts of the Federal Reserve. These moves would require congressional approval and face political and industry resistance. Former FDIC Chair Sheila Bair told the WSJ that banks often rely on their relationships with specific regulators and would likely oppose the disruption of current frameworks. Trump’s campaign and vision align with Republican calls to reduce oversight . The proposed changes primarily aim to streamline regulatory functions and reduce restrictions on financial institutions.

BREAKING: President-elect Donald Trump is looking for ways to potentially eliminate top bank regulators including the FDIC, per WSJ. The Department of Government Efficiency, @DOGE , has reportedly asked if the FDIC could be abolished. pic.twitter.com/G4ZPG8vBu9 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) December 13, 2024 The assumption with a report like this is that Trump’s broader deregulatory agenda could create an environment with fewer compliance hurdles for the crypto space. As traditional financial institutions face reduced oversight, the crypto industry may seize the opportunity to fill gaps in decentralized finance and blockchain-based solutions. The proposed changes could also influence consumer perceptions of financial security. If public trust in traditional banks wavers due to reduced deposit insurance protections, crypto proponents might highlight blockchain’s transparency and security as viable alternatives. This could spur increased adoption of stablecoins and other digital assets as decentralized hedges against banking risks.

Frank Richard Ahlgren, a Texas investor who bought Bitcoin during Satoshi’s time, was sentenced to two years in prison for underreporting $3.7 million in earnings from selling Bitcoin from 2017 to 2019. The US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in a statement that during rigorous checks, Frank Richard Ahlgren filed false tax returns between 2017 and 2019, underreporting or failing to report $4 million worth of Bitcoin sales from which he made significant profits. In October 2017, Ahlgren sold approximately 640 Bitcoins for approximately $5,807.53 for a total of $3.7 million and used the proceeds to purchase a home in Park City, Utah. When it came time to file his 2017 federal income tax return, Ahlgren reported that he had purchased the BTC he sold at much higher prices than they actually were in order to hide the full size of his Bitcoin gains. Ahlgren also sold BTC in 2018 and 2019 but never reported these sales on his 2018 and 2019 tax returns. The DOJ also stated that Ahlgren used mixers and wallet transfers to conceal funds, resulting in more than $1 million in tax losses. At this point, the DOJ added that Ahlgren must pay $1.1 million in restitution to the U.S. government. Acting Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division said: “Frank Ahlgren made millions of dollars buying and selling Bitcoin. “But instead of paying the taxes he knew he was owed, he lied to his accountant about the size of a large portion of his earnings and attempted to conceal some more of his profits by using sophisticated techniques designed to disguise his transactions on the bitcoin blockchain. This behavior earned him a two-year prison sentence today.” *This is not investment advice.

French Hill, a staunch supporter of the crypto sector, secured the House Financial Services Committee chairmanship on Thursday. Hill (R-Arkansas) will take the reins from fellow GOP lawmaker Patrick McHenry (R-North Carolina), who didn’t seek reelection this year. McHenry is also a vocal digital asset advocate . Hill has an “A” rating from Stand With Crypto, a digital asset advocacy group backed by top US crypto exchange Coinbase. He co-sponsored the pro-crypto House Resolution 109 , which would have reversed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121. SAB 121 is a guidance bulletin that states certain companies should label digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, even if they are simply holding them for customers. The House Resolution passed the House and Senate earlier this year but was vetoed by President Joe Biden in May. A House effort to overturn the veto failed to secure the necessary two-thirds majority in July. The Arkansas lawmaker has also blasted the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for allegedly having “pressured banks to sever ties with entire industries like crypto.” Hill promised in November that the House Financial Services Committee would work with President-elect Donald Trump to halt that pressure and conduct an investigation.

37590958,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=623836,1734103800,Bitcoin Whales and DeFi Enthusiasts Align: This Blockchain Could Be the Next Big Thing,"Cryptocurrency and blockchain enthusiasts are buzzing with excitement—and for good reason. While the blockchain space is full of innovation, one platform has been steadily capturing the attention of Bitcoin whales and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) enthusiasts alike. Enter Lightchain Protocol AI , a groundbreaking blockchain ecosystem blending artificial intelligence with decentralized innovation. 🌐 This isn’t just another blockchain; Lightchain is rewriting the playbook for scalability, efficiency, and meaningful AI-powered applications. With its revolutionary Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus algorithm and cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , it promises to be the next big thing in blockchain. Here’s why investors and tech pioneers are jumping at the chance to get in early. 🚀 Why Bitcoin Whales and DeFi Enthusiasts Are Paying Attention Blockchain developments are measured by their ability to solve real-world problems. Lightchain addresses some of the most pressing challenges in the crypto and tech worlds today: Scalability Issues Bitcoin may be king, but its scalability concerns have long been a pain point. Likewise, Ethereum’s growing user base often encounters congestion, leading to high gas fees. Lightchain’s PoI consensus model not only secures the network but also rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, turning scalability from a problem into an opportunity. DeFi Innovations DeFi investors are always on the lookout for platforms that provide versatile tools to build applications that stretch beyond finance. Lightchain combines the benefits of secure decentralized governance with the flexibility of AI-driven tools, bridging the gap between DeFi and advanced AI capabilities. Transparency and Trust Lightchain’s Transparent AI Framework fosters trust by providing open, auditable, and accountable AI workflows. For serious investors looking for stable but innovative projects, transparency is a must. Key Features Making Lightchain Shine The Lightchain Protocol AI stands out with features that make it far more than just a blockchain: 1. Proof of Intelligence (PoI) Consensus PoI is a giant leap forward from conventional consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead of wasting computational power on solving meaningless equations (as PoW does), PoI rewards nodes for carrying out real-world AI computations like model training and optimization. That’s efficiency and purpose combined! 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) The AIVM isn’t just about executing smart contracts; it’s about revolutionizing them. By embedding AI-powered functionality directly into the blockchain, developers can build applications capable of tasks like predictive modeling, personalized strategies, and deeper data analysis. Example use cases? Picture a dApp that predicts market trends before they happen or a supply chain management tool capable of real-time adjustments. 📊💡 3. Advanced Community Governance With its decentralized governance model, Lightchain puts decision-making power back into the hands of its users. Token holders can propose and vote on ecosystem updates, ensuring the platform evolves in alignment with community priorities while leveraging AI for smarter, data-backed decisions. 4. Smarter Security with AI Blockchain security remains a critical focus across the industry. Lightchain’s integration of AI gives it an edge by detecting vulnerabilities and potential threats before they can compromise the system. 5. Supporting the Meme Economy And yes, for those into creativity (and fun financial opportunities), Lightchain AI even supports meme projects with its Memecoin Launchpad. 😉 The Growing Buzz Around Lightchain From seasoned Bitcoin whales to fledgling DeFi enthusiasts, people are recognizing that Lightchain brings something powerful and different to the table. Its ability to marry AI with blockchain isn’t just a technological feat—it’s a competitive advantage. And the best part? You can get in early. Why the buzz?

Initially dismissed as speculative and frivolous, these playful digital assets, often inspired by internet memes, have proven their ability to drive significant market activity and attract a new wave of participants to the crypto ecosystem. According to CoinGecko data , the memecoin market capitalization currently sits at $140 billion, up from its $17-21 billion range in 2023. As these coins gain traction, they serve as a gateway for newcomers to explore the broader cryptocurrency landscape, bridging the gap between casual interest and deeper engagement. This phenomenon raises a critical question: how are market makers, the backbone of liquidity and price stability in crypto markets, influencing the adoption and sustainability of memecoins? Understanding the dynamics between memecoins and market makers like CLS Global offers valuable insights into how this unconventional segment could drive mainstream crypto adoption. This article explores the impact of memecoins on the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the strategic role market makers play in this evolving narrative. Memecoin Impact on Crypto Adoption Memecoins primarily drive crypto adoption through their accessibility and cultural appeal. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can seem intimidating due to their technical complexity and high prices, memecoins are often cheap and easy to understand. This low barrier to entry encourages first-time investors to dip their toes into the crypto market. Moreover, the viral nature of memecoins has expanded cryptocurrency’s reach beyond traditional financial circles. Social media platforms, particularly TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit, play a significant role in spreading awareness and creating buzz around memecoins. These platforms amplify community engagement, making cryptocurrency discussions more mainstream and inviting new demographics into the fold. However, the volatile and speculative nature of memecoins can deter institutional investors and long-term adoption. This is where market makers like CLS Global come into play, mitigating risks and ensuring smoother market operations. The Role of Market Makers Like CSL Global Market makers are essential for maintaining liquidity in financial markets, and their importance is magnified in the volatile world of memecoins. CLS Global , a leading player in the market-making space, has been instrumental in stabilizing trading environments for memecoins and the general crypto market. By providing liquidity, they reduce price slippage and create more efficient markets, making it easier for both retail and institutional investors to participate. In the case of memecoins, market makers like CLS Global offer several key benefits: • Liquidity Provision Many memecoins suffer from thin order books, which can lead to significant price fluctuations. Market makers step in to ensure consistent trading activity, reducing volatility and improving the user experience. • Increased Credibility Memecoin projects can demonstrate their commitment to creating sustainable ecosystems by partnering with market makers. This, in turn, attracts more serious investors and helps these tokens gain legitimacy. • Accessibility and Onboarding CLS Global and leading market makers often work with exchanges to optimize trading conditions. This collaboration makes it easier for new investors to buy and sell memecoins without excessive fees or delays. • Support for Innovation Beyond liquidity, market makers contribute to the growth of memecoins by supporting tokenomics design, advising on market strategies, and ensuring regulatory compliance. These services are critical for turning a viral sensation into a long-term success story. Overview of CLS Global CLS Global is a leading crypto market-maker, especially on centralized exchanges (CEXs). In today’s crypto world, projects need more than just a market marker that provides trading liquidity. These projects need industry-oriented partners who clearly understand traditional finance and the unique crypto dynamics. CLS Global has positioned itself to serve as both a liquidity provider and a support system for various crypto and blockchain projects at different stages of development. CLS Global services include but are not limited to market making, helping projects navigate the complexities of exchange listing, and comprehensive liquidity strategies to ensure token visibility and reduce slippage for clients. Aside from the market-making services, CLS Global also offers consulting services ranging from financial modeling to marketing strategies, connecting projects with potential investors. Some of CLS Global’s growth initiatives include: • Building relationships with over 60 VC funds/advisors• Developing comprehensive technical and business roadmaps• Building stronger connections with top exchanges like Binance, MEXC, Kucoin, and Huobi.• Enhancing marketing capabilities and partnerships Since its inception in 2017, CLS Global has integrated over 80 centralized exchanges, currently services more than 500 clients, and has attracted over 1 million holders. Conclusion The initial exposure to memecoins often leads investors to explore more established cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based applications, contributing to overall market growth. Market makers like CLS Global play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between speculative hype and sustainable adoption. By providing the infrastructure needed for stable and efficient trading, they help transform memecoins from fleeting trends into enduring assets within the crypto economy. The interplay between memecoins, market makers, and the broader blockchain ecosystem will likely shape the next wave of cryptocurrency adoption. With the right balance of innovation, community engagement, and institutional support, memecoins could continue to drive interest in crypto, proving that even the most unusual aspects of the blockchain world can profoundly impact its future.

Ahlgren was found guilty of filing false tax returns and underreporting considerable capital gains from his Bitcoin investments.The Case Against AhlgrenBetween 2017 and 2019, Ahlgren filed federal tax returns that either misrepresented or completely omitted substantial profits from Bitcoin sales. Notably, Ahlgren began purchasing Bitcoin as early as 2011.His most notable transaction occurred in 2017 when he sold 640 BTC tokens for $3.7 million. Using the proceeds, he purchased a house in Park City, Utah. However, Ahlgren misled his accountant during the preparation of his 2017 tax return. In particular, he inflated the purchase price of his Bitcoin holdings, thereby underreporting his actual capital gain from the sale.In addition to his 2017 false reporting, Ahlgren made further efforts to conceal his Bitcoin transactions in 2018 and 2019. These efforts included transferring Bitcoin through multiple wallets, conducting in-person cash exchanges, and utilizing mixers to obfuscate the source of his transactions. Despite these efforts to hide his activity, the IRS Criminal Investigation team was able to track the transactions. They uncovered a total tax loss exceeding $1 million.Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart Goldberg emphasized that Ahlgren's attempts to hide his gains would not go unpunished. ""Ahlgren believed his crypto transactions were untraceable, but the law applies to everyone, regardless of the medium,"" said Goldberg.Sentencing and PenaltiesU.S. District Court Judge Robert Pitman has sentenced Ahlgren to prison, requiring him to pay restitution of $1,095,031 and serve one year of supervised release. This case marks the first criminal tax evasion prosecution focused exclusively on cryptocurrency. It establishes a precedent as the IRS and Department of Justice ramp up their scrutiny of digital assets.Notably, Ahlgren's investment in Bitcoin dates back to 2011, the year that Satoshi Nakamoto , the pseudonymous creator of Bitcoin, stepped away from the project, leaving behind an unsolved mystery that has intrigued the crypto world ever since.

Despite the dominance of centralized exchanges like Binance, challenges persist in the industry. Kraken Australia is facing a $5.1 million fine for compliance breaches, and Coinbase’s FOIA lawsuit against the FDIC is creating regulatory tensions. Meanwhile, Crypto.com is expanding its footprint through strategic partnerships and acquisitions, including teaming up with Deutsche Bank for corporate banking in Asia-Pacific. It is also broadening its services to include more traditional financial offerings. Binance Outpaces Rivals in User Deposits and Trading Volume Binance, the leading crypto exchange, reported over $24 billion in user deposit inflows for 2024, according to data from DefiLlama . This figure is higher than the combined inflows of ten other exchanges. In a blog post, Binance attributed this very impressive growth to a global surge in digital asset adoption that was fueled by regulatory advancements, historic price milestones, and the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in major markets like the U.S and Hong Kong. The exchange now boasts a user base of close to 250 million people worldwide. Top exchanges by inflows in 2024 (Source: DeFiLlama ) According to DefiLlama, Bybit and OKX are the next largest exchanges in terms of inflows, with $8.2 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. Other exchanges, like BitMEX, Robinhood, and HTX, recorded net inflows of $3.45 billion, $3.17 billion, and $2.12 billion. On the other hand, platforms like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, and Crypto.com experienced outflows. Bitstamp saw $2.75 billion in withdrawals, followed by Bitfinex at $1.77 billion and Crypto.com at $358.1 million. DefiLlama did not include Coinbase and Gemini in its analysis because of the lack of wallet transparency, as these exchanges have not provided proof-of-reserves despite being publicly listed. Institutional capital also surged across centralized exchanges, with the average Bitcoin deposit on Binance increasing from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC in 2024. USDT deposits grew a lot as well, rising from $19,600 to $230,000, according to CryptoQuant . Binance also pointed out that it became the first centralized exchange to surpass $100 trillion in trading volume, with OKX trailing at $25 trillion in lifetime volume. Top CEXs by lifetime trading volumes (Source: CCData ) Despite predictions that there might be a shift towards decentralized exchanges (DEXs) after the collapse of FTX in late 2022, centralized exchanges still dominate trading activity. In the past 24 hours, CEXs tracked by CoinGecko recorded $276 billion in trading volume compared to $28.5 billion on DEXs. Kraken Australia Fined Unfortunately, things are not going well for all exchanges. Australia's Federal Court recently fined Bit Trade, the Australian operator of the crypto exchange Kraken, 8 million Australian dollars ($5.1 million) after a case brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission ( ASIC ). The judgment was delivered on Dec. 12 by Justice John Nicholas. He ordered Bit Trade to pay the fine in 60 days and also cover court costs. The court found the company guilty of failing to comply with design and distribution obligations and operating as a credit facility without the necessary license. Although the penalty is quite high, it is still less than the $12.8 million that was asked for by ASIC, which the judge described as excessive. It did, however, exceed Bit Trade's proposed fine of $2.5 million. ASIC’s case centered on Bit Trade's ”margin extension” product, which allowed users to trade crypto and fiat with leverage without the legally mandated target market determination (TMD). ASIC Chair Joe Longo explained that TMDs are crucial when it comes to protecting investors from unsuitable products. Longo revealed that over 1,100 Australians used the margin extension, incurring $7 million in fees and interest while losing more than $5 million. One investor even lost almost $4 million. Justice Nicholas criticized Bit Trade for prioritizing revenue over compliance, and pointed out that the company continued offering the margin extension to retail clients despite being fully aware of its legal obligations. Nicholas considers Bit Trade’s breaches of corporate law to be very serious, especially as the product was offered without considering local regulations until ASIC finally intervened. Coinbase FOIA Lawsuit Pressures FDIC A U.S. federal judge recently criticized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for its extensive redactions in “pause letters” sent to banks regarding crypto-related activities. According to Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal , the criticism arose from a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit that was supported by Coinbase. In a Dec. 12 order, Washington, DC, District Court Judge Ana Reyes stated that the FDIC appeared to lack a “good-faith effort” in its redactions, and called for more thoughtful revisions. Reyes also demanded that the agency refile the letters by Jan. 3. Additionally, the judge warned that the FDIC must be prepared to justify each redaction. The pause letters were sent to 23 financial institutions, and urged them to halt or limit their crypto-related services. Grewal criticized the FDIC’s approach, and suggested that it supports the belief that the Biden administration is trying to restrict crypto’s access to financial services. This strategy is referred to as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 .” He accused the FDIC of using overly broad redactions, and questioned what the agency might be attempting to conceal. This controversy happened amid broader discussions about potential regulatory changes. Reports suggest that Donald Trump’s advisors considered merging or eliminating agencies like the FDIC, as well as restructuring the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. In preparation for these possible changes, Coinbase outlined plans to diversify its revenue streams. The exchange plans to shift towards stablecoin fees, staking rewards, and subscription services to reduce its dependence on market volatility. Crypto.com Partners with Deutsche Bank In other crypto exchange-related news, Crypto.com recently partnered with Deutsche Bank to provide corporate banking services across key Asia-Pacific markets, including Singapore, Australia, and Hong Kong. Deutsche Bank is known for offering fiat-to-crypto exchange and cross-border trading services to cryptocurrency firms, and hinted at expanding the partnership to the United Kingdom and Europe in the near future. Crypto.com is based in Singapore, and has been actively growing its presence in the region. In November, it acquired Australian brokerage Fintek Securities , which allowed the exchange to offer traditional financial products through a regulated platform. In Hong Kong, Crypto.com is also listed as “deemed to be licensed” by the Securities and Futures Commission. The Asia-Pacific region saw very strong cryptocurrency adoption in 2024. Singapore, Hong Kong, and the UAE ranked among global leaders. Singapore leads due to its advanced banking system, large investments, and comprehensive regulations for digital asset companies. While traditional financial institutions are expanding into digital assets, Crypto.com is diversifying into traditional finance. Its roadmap for 2025 even includes offerings like stocks, derivatives trading, banking services, yield on cash balances, and credit card solutions. The company also recently acquired US-regulated broker-dealer Watchdog Capital to broaden its reach to include stocks and equity options for eligible traders in the United States. Other exchanges in the region, like OKX , are also integrating traditional services. OKX recently launched fiat deposits and withdrawals in Singapore after its acquisition of a local payment institution license and appointing a former regulator as CEO of its subsidiary.",POSITIVE,없음,ASIA | EXCHANGE | FIAT | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6538/binance-tops-crypto-exchange-rankings-with-24-b-in-2024-deposits,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

The largest crypto by market cap absorbed potential profit-taking and maintained its momentum. We see strong demand and renewed investor confidence behind the market activity. Fresh capital inflows appear to be fueling the surge, with Bitcoin weathering price dips that barely last a day. Bitcoin above $100k as it absorbs potential profit-taking Bitcoin’s performance remains strong after hitting the much-awaited record high of $100K. At press time, BTC is trading above the level after touching a 24-hour high of $102,528, as per CoinGecko data on Friday. IntoTheBlock data reveals that 99% of holders are in profit at the current price. What is noteworthy is the Bitcoin price strength despite volatility in traditional financial markets. Data from blockchain analytics firms also underline that 71% of Bitcoin holders have held their assets for over a year, again showcasing a long-term conviction. Fresh capital appears to be a key driver behind Bitcoin’s resilience. CryptoQuant’s Ki Young Ju previously explained “fresh capital” as the reason behind sustained price momentum. Additionally, transaction volumes for transfers greater than $100,000 have exceeded $233 billion over the past week, which can only mean one thing— institutional interest. Stocks see high sales in 6:1 ratio While Bitcoin soars, corporate executives are selling stocks at record levels. According to The Kobeissi Letter on X, the ratio of stock sellers to buyers has hit a staggering 6:1. This could indicate executives capitalizing on high valuations or repositioning their portfolios in either light of economic uncertainties or overvaluation.

It is taking a little break while the trend remains highly bullish on the daily. Changing sentiments to bullish in November, Hbar saw a mind-blowing recovery from a seven-month bearish correction as it rallied by almost 10x within a month. Unfortunately, it faced a rejection and halted the rally. Since the price recovered above $0.24 a few days ago, it has remained indecisive with choppy price actions. Though the bulls are trying to push higher but it appears there is not enough buying volume in the market as the price stalled at around $0.3. An increase above the level should bring trading back to the recent high before exploding to a new monthly high. Failure to break higher may lead to another sell capable of plunging the price under the $0.2 level. Such scenarios may slow down bullish action for a while before climbing back. Volatility appears low at the moment. Looking at the daily volume indicator, which is now on the fall, Hbar’s bulls appeared exhaustedly weak but the price is still up 7% weekly. While this suggests that the market is still under the bulls’ radar, we can expect more growth in the future. HBAR’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing higher, the bulls could retake the current monthly $0.392 high marked last week. Breaking through it to $0.4, the next level to consider for a test is $0.5 and $0.6. If a drop occurs, the holding $0.234 support may be revisited. Losing grip above that support, the $0.187 level is the next support to watch, followed by $0.126.

Increasing activity in its network signals expansion that could grow the demand for ETH and cause long-term price stability. ADA is on a strong bullish correction with anticipation of its rally past the 3-year-old ATH. Although its trading volume has declined, its 93.8% 30-day growth tells a story of a continuing bull. Monsta Mash could revolutionize blockchain gaming with its hybrid P2E/T2E technology. While most of its competitors use ordinary tokens for in-game rewards and upgrades, $MASH, the utility token within the game and finance platform, has real-world utility. Let us look at projected growths for the three tokens. Monsta Mash Dominates Engaging in The Cryptids-Monsta Mash gameplay rewards players with $MASH tokens. As the tokens that run the Monsta Mash gaming platform, $MASH pays for in-game transactions, game customization, and unlocking new features. The tokens also give players voting rights so that they can weigh in on future game evolutions. Staked $MASH holdings earn interest at up to 19% APY annually. The price of $MASH tokens will change from $0.0018 in phase two to $0.00365 when the next phase goes live. Investors who purchase tokens today will see the price of their token holdings double in days.

After gaining 20.9% in 30 days and 10.2% in two weeks, the altcoin is trading at $3,952 . Market activity has increased as painted by the 3.50% bump in daily trading volume. Ethereum’s spot ETFs are the highlights of its successful rebound and increasing institutional inflows boost investor confidence in ETH. Analysis by Bitwise puts ETH’s target at $7K citing support by successful ETF adoption and growing Layer_2 blockchains. However, Onchain options protocol Derive shows a less than 10% chance of ETH reaching $5K by the end of 2024. ADA gained from $0.5 to $1.23 in a month. The current price at $1.12 represents a 2.6% gain in the last 24 hours. If the current momentum holds, ADA could erase the 6.2% correction recorded over the past week and head toward the $1.40 target . The incoming token unlock will add over 37 million ADA tokens to the market. If the action causes no negative effects on price, ADA could break the $ 1.25 level and head for $1.9. Conclusion Ethereum Strongly indicates it could break through the $4K soon. The altcoin lacks capability for high scalability limiting the amount of returns investors could get even with a super rally. ADA Has struggled to break the $3 barrier and reclaim the previous all-time high price of $3.09. Cardano’s potential for high turnover could be undermined by the 37 million ADA tokens unlocked in mid-December. Monsta Mash’s scalability, diverse $MASH token utility, and low price are some of the pillars upon which the crypto will be built. Grow your investment at lightning speed with $MASH.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-gold-elongold-solana-memecoin-will-explode-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Meanwhile, THORChain (RUNE) price fluctuations suggest a potential trend shift, though market stability will play a key role in upcoming price movements. At the forefront, Web3Bay introduces a blockchain-powered marketplace aiming to transform e-commerce by prioritising decentralisation, transparency and user control. With 3BAY tokens in presale at $0.003 and a projected 6430% ROI, early investors may seize a rare opportunity to support this ambitious Web3 venture. Hedera Integration with LayerZero Enhances Cross-Chain Potential Hedera’s latest LayerZero integration is a strategic move to improve cross-chain capabilities, launched in conjunction with the mainnet v0.54 update. This Hedera integration aims to boost interoperability within the Web3 space, enhancing decentralised app connectivity across different blockchains. While the advancement holds promise, it’s important to remain cautious, as real-world results depend heavily on adoption and operational resilience. The integration reflects Hedera’s ambition to position itself as a versatile player in the evolving Web3 crypto environment. THORChain (RUNE) Price: Can a Trend Reversal Signal New Highs? THORChain (RUNE) price recently tested a 93-day support trend line, sparking speculation about a potential trend reversal. The price climbed steadily since August 5, reaching $6.32 in late October before a decline to a 46-day low in early November. Following the drop, RUNE rebounded quickly, recovering previous losses. While some analysts suggest this movement hints at bullish momentum, predicting a new yearly high remains uncertain. Observing support stability will be key in assessing the RUNE price trajectory. Web3Bay's Blockchain Market To Transform Online Shopping With DeFi Power Web3Bay is rewriting the rules of online shopping, bringing a fresh approach that tackles key pain points in traditional e-commerce. With blockchain as its backbone, Web3Bay offers a space where user privacy, transparency, and control come first. Here, every transaction is clear and secure, making online shopping more trustworthy and user-centric. Picture an online marketplace where buyers and sellers connect directly, without costly middlemen. Web3Bay’s decentralised model slashes unnecessary fees, making it easier than ever for people around the world to trade freely—even those without access to conventional banking. And with community-led governance, users gain a meaningful role in shaping Web3Bay’s future, turning every transaction into a step toward a truly user-owned marketplace. At the heart of Web3Bay’s ecosystem, the 3BAY token powers transactions, offers discounts, and invites holders to shape the platform’s evolution. With its current presale structured across 28 stages, 3BAY’s price grows with each stage—starting at $0.003 and targeting a 6430% rise by the final stage. Early investors have the chance to support an ambitious project that’s set to change the norms of online shopping. Web3’s Boldest Project Each Web3 crypto project showcases its unique contributions to the ecosystem. Hedera’s LayerZero integration hints at improved blockchain interoperability, potentially expanding dApp use cases.

This brought the bulls back in action and now leads today’s altcoins rally following a 25% gain in the last 24 hours.

The price currently looks strong daily following a recent weekly break up. Prior to the breakout, it rejected a key level and fell into the $1.5 range earlier this week. Luckily, it found support and resumed buying pressure at full speed. The recent break has put the market in a more bullish state and as we can see, it is gaining serious traction in the past hours. Although things are not looking good on the daily volume indicator as it slowly declines. A further drop in the volume could result in a serious reduction capable of activating a major correction before resuming buy. Aside from gaining popularity in the past weeks, it is considered one of the best-performing tokens in the AI & Data industry with a staggering 2000% gain in the last four months of trading. Virtual’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Following this week’s break up to the current trading level, the target level for the bulls right now is $3. Breaking above this price level, $4 and $5 would be the next key levels to watch on the way up. The $1.215 level currently provides support for the market. If the price drops and this level fails to contain pressure, $0.63 is the next support to watch, followed by $0.29.

37590118,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392937,1734102601,"XRP Price To Soon Hit $4, Predicts Top Analyst","The post XRP Price To Soon Hit $4, Predicts Top Analyst appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The pressure from the SEC on crypto companies seems to have lessened with the change in the U.S. government. XRP’s legal battle with the SEC has had a big impact on its price but things might change when Trump takes office. XRP has been gaining a lot of attention recently, with a 443% increase in November. At the time of writing, XRP is trading below the $2.50 mark. However, the resistance at $3 is proving to be a crucial hurdle. Despite XRP bulls facing resistance at $3, top analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out that $XRP seems to be forming a bull flag pattern. However, the TD Sequential indicator recently flashed a sell signal on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that XRP could experience a short-term correction before breaking out above $2.46. If this happens, it could potentially send the price all the way up to $4! Looking ahead, many believe that XRP’s fundamentals will improve in 2025, leading to increased demand and adoption. As more people hold onto XRP, it could create scarcity, making it more valuable over time. Ripple (the company behind XRP) is also hopeful that the regulatory environment will improve under the Trump administration, which may be more crypto-friendly. Ripple has faced challenges in the U.S. due to legal issues with the SEC, but a change in policy could open new opportunities. Additionally, Ripple recently got approval to launch RLUSD, a stablecoin, which could help make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. All these factors make people optimistic about XRP’s potential for both short-term and long-term growth. This is huge news for the crypto space, especially for XRP holders, as it signals further adoption of Ripple’s technology. Even Bitcoin is holding strong above $101k at the time of writing, supporting the bullish theory.",POSITIVE,XRP,BTC | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-to-soon-hit-4-predicts-top-analyst/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png
37590062,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105065,1734102574,BitBoy Predicts Two Timelines for XRP to Hit $4.5,"Widely followed media personality Ben Armstrong, known as BitBoy, has proposed two possible timelines for when he believes XRP could reach $4.50. After XRP surpassed the $2 mark in the first week of December, it has remained stuck in a range, unable to break above that level. Just three days ago, XRP revisited its 2021 peak at $1.90 before rebounding.Although XRP has bounced back to the $2 mark, it continues to struggle in gaining the momentum needed to push higher. At the same time, holders are growing increasingly anxious, hoping for a fresh catalyst for XRP's price movement.As a result, market commentators like BitBoy have offered some optimism regarding how long the wait might be. According to him, XRP looks poised for a breakout, suggesting it could rally to $4.50 by the end of this year, which is just two weeks away. However, if this scenario doesn't play out, BitBoy believes the milestone could be reached by January 2025.This bold timeline has sparked both optimism and excitement among the XRP Army. With XRP priced at $2.34, reaching $4.50 would mean an additional 92.3% upside for current holders.Critics Disagree However, some have expressed skepticism regarding XRP's short-term outlook. Critics have challenged BitBoy's prediction, pointing out that he provided no technical data or chart analysis to back his claim. Comment on XRP run Comment on XRP run One observer highlighted that XRP has formed a double top and a lower high, using this observation to argue that XRP is not poised for a breakout anytime soon. This sentiment has gained traction, with some suggesting that now might still be an optimal time to exit the XRP market while in profit. Other Bullish Calls for XRP Short-Term ActionRegardless of the skepticism, bullish sentiment regarding XRP's next move continues to flood the crypto community. Multiple analysts continue to reiterate that a significant rally is reloading for XRP, just as was witnessed in November.One analyst suggested that XRP's next breakout could see the asset hit $5 as early as December 20. The motivation for this bold timeline is the time it took XRP to break out of the $1 range in the last week of November, rising to its seven-year high at $2.87 in the first week of December.Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez has predicted that XRP could reach $4.40 next , highlighting that the asset is forming its fourth bullish pennant. The previous instances occurred in November, during which XRP climbed from $0.68 to $1.2, followed by a correction and a rise to $1.50. Another cooling phase eventually led XRP to surge to $2.87. Based on this pattern, Martinez expects the current period of consolidation to precede another upward move, with $4.40 being the target for XRP.",NEUTRAL,XRP,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/13/bitboy-predicts-two-timelines-for-xrp-to-hit-4-5/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitboy-predicts-two-timelines-for-xrp-to-hit-4-5,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

The recent bullish crypto market tide has lifted all boats, including Stellar (XLM) . Over the past 30 days, the asset has staged a blistering rally that has seen it surge over 250%. Despite this run, one analyst has suggested that the asset is not done.Stellar (XLM) To $2?Prominent crypto analyst ""EGRAG CRYPTO"" has asserted that XLM is set to rally to the $2 price point. The analyst expressed this view in an X post on Friday. He cited a pattern that played out after XLM broke out of an exponential moving average (EMA) on the two-week candle chart in 2020. At the time, the asset rallied over 3,100% to highs around the $0.8 price point.Per EGRAG's chart, XLM broke above this EMA again in 2023, suggesting a potential target of around $2.27.For context, at the time of writing, XLM is exchanging hands for about $0.437.

Riot Platforms Acquires $510M in BTC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The United States-listed Bitcoin mining firm Riot Platforms (RIOT) has acquired a significant 5,117 Bitcoin (BTC) for $510 million. These notable acquisitions occurred when BTC was trading near its all-time high, indicating massive adoption and heightened interest in the world’s largest cryptocurrency. RIOT PLATFORMS INC – ACQUIRES 5,117 BITCOIN FOR $510 MILLION – RTRS — Tree News (@News_Of_Alpha) December 13, 2024 RIOT’s Bitcoin Holding Rises to 16,728 BTC With the recent purchase, Riot’s holdings have now risen to 16,728 BTC, valued at approximately $1.7 billion (a 40% increase from its previous holdings). However, RIOT acquired this notable BTC after raising $500 million through Convertible Senior Notes, as shared by Riot Platforms on X (formerly Twitter). The decision to purchase this significant amount of BTC was made on December 9, 2024. The firm joined Core Scientific and Marathon Digital, both of which purchased BTC by issuing Convertible Notes in August and November 2024.

December 2024 highlights a mix of resilience and forward momentum in the market. However, identifying the best altcoins requires more than just market tracking—it demands a closer look at the innovations driving each network. From BlockDAG’s (BDAG) cutting-edge scalability to Aptos’ (APT) stablecoin innovation, Bitcoin Cash’s (BCH) renewed momentum, Ethereum’s rising institutional adoption, and Cardano’s (ADA) steady market corrections—here are the 5 best cryptos to watch in December 2024! BlockDAG: Scalable Tech and Profitable Bonuses BlockDAG (BDAG) is rewriting blockchain scalability with its DAG-based architecture, merging blockchain’s security and decentralization with DAG’s high-speed transaction processing. This design allows BlockDAG to handle a significantly higher volume of transactions, even during peak usage, while maintaining resilience against congestion. Its parallel processing capability ensures adaptability to growing demand, positioning it for mainstream adoption and long-term sustainability. For instance, in real-world applications, BlockDAG’s scalability supports seamless financial systems, enabling instant cross-border payments without network crashes. This robust foundation has fueled crypto enthusiasts’ confidence in BlockDAG, contributing to its remarkable presale journey. Currently priced at $0.0234 in Batch 26, BDAG reveals a 2240% increase since its first batch. To date, the network has raised over $164 million in presale revenue with more than 17 billion coins sold. Analysts predict that BlockDAG’s strong fundamentals coupled with a significant presale hike, could yield up to 30,000x ROI for early holders, making it one of the best cryptos to watch in December 2024. 2. Aptos: $15 Coin Price Achieved & New Innovations Incoming Aptos (APT) has gained momentum as one of the best cryptos to watch in December 2024, with its price rising from $9.6 in late November to $15 recently, pushing its market cap near $8 billion. While still below its 2021 peak of $20, the Aptos team plans for extensive advances, including parallel transaction processing and on-chain randomness, enabling scalable infrastructure for billions of transactions. These features can support diverse use cases, such as prediction markets and integrated payment systems for loyalty programs. 3. Bitcoin Cash: Reaching New Heights with $12.9B Market Cap Bitcoin Cash (BCH), a prominent Bitcoin spinoff, is experiencing renewed attention as it recovers to $600 with a market cap of $12.9 billion. With its scalable transaction model and focus on fast, low-cost payments, BCH remains a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. Analysts speculate it could reach $1,000, requiring a 1.5x increase in price and market cap beyond $19 billion. Optimism surrounding Bitcoin’s potential six-figure rise may drive a spillover effect, benefiting BCH as a faster, cheaper alternative. 4. Cardano: Market Dip Followed by Modest Recovery Cardano experienced a steep 16% drop recently, briefly reaching $0.91 before closing at $1, marking its largest single-day decline since 2021. On December 10, 2024, ADA saw a slight recovery, rising 1.3% to $1.02. This decline reduced Cardano’s market capitalization to $35.6 billion, ranking it ninth among cryptocurrencies. The drop reflects market profit-taking and broader dynamics, with ADA showing signs of exhaustion. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) exiting overbought territory signals a cooling phase for the asset. 5. Ethereum: ETF Inflows Signal Growing Bullish Trend Ethereum (ETH) saw a 10% drop on Monday as profit-taking reached $2.5 billion, triggering a two-year high in futures liquidations. Despite this, Ethereum ETFs posted a record $836.8 million net inflow last week, led by BlackRock's ETHA, which contributed $573 million. Total ETF inflows surpassed $1.4 billion, reflecting growing institutional interest. Additionally, over 256K ETH was withdrawn from exchanges, signaling bullish sentiment as reserves decreased. Due to its strong fundamentals, Ethereum remains among the best cryptos to watch in December 2024. Summing Up: Best Cryptos to Watch in December 2024 To summarize, Aptos demonstrates its potential through stablecoin integration and scalable infrastructure, while Bitcoin Cash gains attention as a fast, cost-effective crypto option. Cardano's modest recovery signals resilience amid market corrections and Ethereum’s institutional inflows highlight growing confidence. However, with its strong foundation and exceptional growth potential signaling a 30,000x ROI potential, BlockDAG remains one of the best cryptos to watch in December 2024.

The price gained concurrent with open interest in futures, which stood at its record-high level of $770 million. That a price and open-interest uptick is happening and gaining attention makes investors believe Chainlink will grow further.

The analysts opine that Chainlink’s overall fundamentals are improving since there is an upward trend shown by active addresses. Favorable Forecasts Anticipated Analysts are enthusiastic about Chainlink’s potential price trajectory. Current forecasts indicate that LINK may increase by 9% to attain $32.77 by January 12, 2025. The technical indicators reveal a positive sentiment, as evidenced by a Fear & Greed Index score of 76, signifying high greed in the market. In the preceding month, Chainlink has documented 17 green days out of 30 and has had a price volatility of 23%. Considering these factors, numerous experts assert that it is an opportune moment to get Chainlink. Strategic Alliances Boost Trust Rating Chainlink’s strategic alliances are generating hope regarding its future. World Liberty Financial recently garnered attention by acquiring LINK tokens valued at $1 million. Furthermore, partnerships with prominent entities such as Emirates NBD and Swift Network aim to bolster the use of decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions and incorporate blockchain technology into conventional financial systems. As Chainlink forges these alliances, its status as the preeminent oracle network is reinforced. Market analysts estimate LINK might value $50 in the following months depending on the continuation of present trends. Based on current price movements, LINK appears to have passed significant resistance thresholds, thereby allowing possible additional increases.

With BTFD Coin’s presale raising over $3.6 million, Bonk setting the stage with a 1 trillion token burn initiative, and Dogs delivering consistent growth, the meme coin market is buzzing with potential. But let’s get real: not all meme coins are created equal. While Dogs and Bonk offers intriguing stories, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its unique P2E game, staking rewards, and community-driven ethos. Here’s why these three are the best meme coins to join for short term gains. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Dip You Can’t Miss! Buying the dip isn’t just a strategy—it’s a lifestyle, and BTFD Coin is bringing that ethos to life with a presale performance that’s making waves. Since its launch on November 26, 2024, this bullish token has already raised over $3.6 million, selling more than 52 billion coins. At just $0.00012 in its 11th presale stage, BTFD offers a golden opportunity to join a project that’s primed for explosive growth. Analysts predict the coin could hit $0.0006 post-presale, giving early investors a potential 5x return. Imagine investing $1,250 in Stage 11 at $0.00012 per coin. You’d snag over 10.4 million BTFD tokens. When the price reaches $0.0006, that $1,250 turns into a cool $6,250—not bad for a short-term play, right? But it’s not just about numbers. BTFD is creating a whole ecosystem for its users. Its P2E game—now in beta—lets players rack up points in an immersive gaming experience. While the beta version doesn’t offer rewards just yet, it’s laying the groundwork for future earning opportunities. Pair this with staking rewards averaging 90% APY, and you’ve got a project that’s more than a meme—it’s a movement. The presale metrics speak volumes. With over 4,700 bullish holders and escalating demand, BTFD’s current price of $0.00012 feels like a steal. Miss this, and you might regret it when the next bull run catapults this coin into the stratosphere. Dogs (DOGS): Quiet Consistency in a Volatile Market Not every meme coin needs fireworks to make an impact. Dogs (DOGS) is a prime example of steady growth in a market known for its wild swings. Trading at $0.00078813 as of December 12, 2024, Dogs has shown a slight but meaningful 0.14378% increase from its previous close. With an intraday high of $0.00078923, this coin may not be making headlines, but it’s quietly building trust among its holders. Dogs offer a unique proposition: stability in an otherwise unpredictable meme coin landscape. For those who prefer a low-risk entry into the world of meme coins, DOGS presents an attractive option. While it lacks the flashy P2E games or staking rewards of BTFD, its steady performance makes it a reliable addition to a diversified portfolio. This coin’s appeal lies in its simplicity. There’s no over-the-top marketing or risky tokenomics—just a straightforward crypto project with a loyal community. If you’re looking for a meme coin that won’t give you sleepless nights, Dogs might just be your best bet. Bonk (BONK): Burn, Baby, Burn If drama and volatility are your thing, Bonk (BONK) has got you covered. Trading at $0.00004069, BONK has seen a slight uptick of 0.10571% since its last close. But the real story lies in its aggressive token burn initiative. In November 2024, BONK hit an all-time high of $0.000062, thanks in part to its listing on the Upbit exchange and the announcement of a 1 trillion token burn. This move aims to increase scarcity and drive up demand, making it one of the best meme coins to join for short term gains. But let’s not sugarcoat it: BONK is not for the faint-hearted. Its significant price swings make it a high-risk, high-reward play. However, for those who thrive on adrenaline, BONK offers the perfect storm of opportunity and excitement. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer looking to test the waters, this coin demands your attention. While its future remains uncertain, one thing is clear: BONK’s community is passionate and engaged, which could be a key driver for its next rally. Keep an eye on this one—you might just find yourself riding the wave to a lucrative payout. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as the most promising option among the three. Its record-breaking presale , innovative P2E game, and robust community make it a no-brainer for anyone looking to capitalise on the next bull run. That said, Dogs offers a stable alternative for risk-averse investors, while Bonk provides a thrilling ride for those who enjoy market volatility. Don’t wait too long to act. The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities like these don’t come around often. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and be part of a community that’s redefining what it means to buy the dip. With gains like these on the horizon, these are the best meme coins to join for short term profits.

37589766,https://nulltx.com/?p=135676,1734102031,Avalanche and Polkadot Continue to Surge as Traders Target Viral Presale 1Fuel for Explosive Returns,"Avalanche and Polkadot have regained their upward momentum. The altcoins are eyeing a better end to 2024 and an impressive start to the new year. However, the market’s attention is largely on 1Fuel . The new tokens presale has gone viral as investors look to benefit from its predicted explosive returns. 1Fuel is one of the top cryptos to buy now, as the investment could turn out to be extremely succesful. 1Fuel presale: Low-risk investment opportunity with high potential returns The 1Fuel presale is becoming more viral as the hype around it increases. 1Fuel token is seen as one of the must-buy crypto coins ahead of the new year due to promises of explosive returns. The token is expected to do close to 500% soon and about 200x in the long run. These are high potential yields, especially for early investors. The perceived explosive return has increased 1Fuel’s adoption and prominence, especially among top crypto investors. The token has sold more than 10% of its total presale allocation, and it’s continuing to sell out fast. 1Fuel is one of the top cryptos to buy now so you must be quick to avoid missing out on a potential boom. The token will perform utility functions on the 1Fuel platform, ensuring the crypto solution achieves laid-out objectives. These objectives include simplifying transactions, offering passive income opportunities for users, providing better security, and improving overall experience. This will make 1Fuel appealing to crypto users and make the 1Fuel token an in-demand token. The 1Fuel ecosystem will be a hub of numerous opportunities. However, the 1Fuel token will be vital to exploring and benefiting from these opportunities. The token is poised to become one of the most important crypto coins in the DeFi space, making it a must-have. Join the presale now to be among the potential high gainers. Avalanche back on the rise as Q4 rounds up Avalanche is back, attempting to surge beyond $60 again. The altcoin’s last attempt reached $55 before dipping below the $45 support. Avalanche has now rallied back to $53, and it’s expected to reverse its over 5% loss in the past week. Avalanche has a $65 yearly high, and the current outlook suggests it may not set another before Q1 2025. However, Avalanche could rally beyond this price early in the coming year and make a play for $100. This places Avalanche amongst the must-buy crypto coins to consider ahead of the new year. An impressive Q1 could lay a solid foundation for Avalanche to yield good returns through 2025. Analysts believe it’s a good coin to monitor and has the potential to yield good returns. Polkadot eyes $20 as it nears a return to a double-digit market price Polkadot dipped by almost 20% in the past week, dumping below its $11.60 monthly high. With the market now stabilizing again, Polkadot is gradually reversing its loss. The altcoin has surged from its support at $8.6 and now looks to break the resistance at $10 again. At press time, Polkadot tested the $10 resistance but failed to rally beyond $9.65. Polkadot is expected to make another attempt soon and may eventually surge beyond its $11.80 yearly high. Experts project a finish of around $13 for Polkadot by year-end, while the altcoin could reach $20 before Q1 2025 ends. Polkadot ranks 15th by market cap currently but could be a top 10 cryptocurrency soon. Conclusion Polkadot and Avalanche are currently having a good run and reversing previous losses. However, their run could be nothing compared to 1Fuel’s expected yield. The new token is expected to yield explosive returns, making the presale an excellent investment to consider.

Amid rising confidence and optimism, demand for Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP) picks up—altcoins to watch out for. IntelMarkets (INTL) , a novel blend of AI and DeFi, is also on investors’ radars. Its intriguing blend of disruptive innovations has caught experts’ attention, hailed as one of this cycle’s best bets. IntelMarkets (INTL): This Cycle’s Best Bet? IntelMarkets (INTL), alongside Ripple (XRP) and Solana (SOL), are perceived as 2025’s best bets. Its significant upside potential as a low-cap gem is one of its many attractions.

37589909,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=627073,1734101946,Early Bitcoin investor jailed for falsely reporting crypto gains in $4M BTC sale,"A Bitcoin investor from Texas has become the first person to be imprisoned for failing to disclose crypto gains. The individual in question was sentenced to two years in jail today for filing a tax return that falsely underreported his capital gains from selling $3.7 million in Bitcoin. According to the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Frank Richard Ahlgren III, a Texas-based Bitcoin investor, “falsely underreported the (realized) capital gains” gained by selling Bitcoin worth $3.7 million from 2017 to 2019. In a report released on December 12, the Department of Justice stated: “All taxpayers are required to report any sale proceeds and gains or losses from the sale of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, on a tax return.” Bitcoin investor takes pride in playing the government As per the details provided in a US court, Frank Richard Ahlgren started investing in Bitcoin in 2011. Ahlgren then used his Coinbase accounts to acquire approximately 1,366 bitcoins in 2015. The highest price that Bitcoins sold for that year was approximately $495.56. Ahlgren sold approximately 640 Bitcoins in October 2017, at a price of approximately $5,807.53 per Bitcoin, for a total of $3.7 million. Ahlgren submitted a fake summary of his gains and losses from the sale of his crypto to his accountant when it was time to prepare his 2017 federal income tax return. In order to conceal the full extent of his gain, Ahlgren claimed that he purchased the Bitcoins at prices significantly higher than those he actually paid. “Frank Ahlgren III earned millions buying and selling Bitcoins,” said Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Goldberg of the Justice Department’s Tax Division. “But instead of paying the taxes he knew were due, he lied to his accountant about the extent of a large portion of his gains, and sought to conceal another chunk of his profits through sophisticated techniques designed to obscure his transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. That conduct today earned him a two-year sentence.” In 2018 and 2019, Ahlgren sold Bitcoins for more than $650,000 but did not disclose these sales on his 2018 and 2019 tax filings. This time, he concealed the information by having multiple wallets. He also used intermediaries to conceal the individual who executed the transaction and met an individual in person to exchange bitcoins for cash. That was not all. Due to his ‘success’ in circumventing the law, in May 2014, Ahlgren blogged about his knowledge of mixers as ways to add anonymity to Bitcoin transactions. The court’s decision According to Acting Special Agent in Charge Lucy Tan of the IRS-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Houston Field Office, Ahlgren will receive a prison sentence. In addition to his sentence, US District Court Judge Robert Pitman for the Western District of Texas mandated that Ahlgren be subject to one year of supervised release and pay $1,095,031 in restitution to the United States. The United States government, under Biden, has sought to crack down on any crypto entity or individual who deems themselves smart enough to beat the system . Warnings have been abundant under Gary Gensler’s SEC . The acting Special Agent in Charge gave a warning statement, saying, “This case marks the first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency. As the prices for crypto are high, so is the temptation to not pay taxes on its sale. Avoid the temptation and avoid federal prison.” The court asserted that the case serves as a testament to the fact that no one is exempt from the law. Lucy Tan adds, “This case demonstrates that no one is above the law. My team at IRS Criminal Investigation has the expertise and tools to track financial activity, whether it involves dollars, pesos, or cryptocurrency.” The IRS-CI and the Texas Office of Attorney General are investigating the case. Assistant Chief Michael C. Boteler, Trial Attorney Mary Frances Richardson of the Tax Division, and Assistant US Attorney William R. Harris for the Western District of Texas are prosecuting the case.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. PropiChain, a decentralized real estate marketplace, raised $1.3M in its presale, aiming to change the $300T sector. Table of Contents How PropiChain aims to change real estate Why the crypto presale could be the next crypto success story Now could be the best time to invest in PropiChain PropiChain is a decentralized real estate marketplace that aims to change investment in the $300 trillion global real estate sector. The first round of its crypto presale raised more than 1.3 million dollars, and the second stage is ongoing. The project could be the next crypto success story. How PropiChain aims to change real estate We will discuss how PropiChain aims to reshape real estate processes and make them more efficient for investors. You might also like: XRP vs. Solana vs. PropiChain: The race to deliver 25,000% gains first Solves liquidity issues and barriers to entry through fractional ownership Due to the high entry capital requirements, small investors need help participating in the traditional 300 trillion-dollar sector. Even if these investors want to take out loans to make an upfront payment for their desired asset, traditional banks usually give priority to individuals with strong credit histories. The low inclusion due to capital led to a liquidity issue in the real estate market. There are not enough buyers, and properties can be up for sale for months without getting buyers. However, PropiChain aims to introduce a fractional ownership model to the trillion-dollar sector to remove capital constraints and make it more liquid. With this model, investors can pool resources and purchase fractions of properties based on their capital. Aside from breaking the financial barrier, the fractional ownership model also means that investors can own fractions in diverse properties, increasing their chances of profitability. Virtual interactions and properties exploration The integration with the Metaverse means that the crypto presale project PropiChain could bring a dynamic and interactive experience to a top-three global sector by revenue in a way that surpasses the traditional method. International buyers can interact with sellers and virtually explore their potential property from their comfort zone. Instead of travelling miles to inspect the asset or meet with sellers. This will be very convenient for real estate traders since all the sector processes can be carried out virtually. AI-powered real estate investment With PropiChain’s integrated AI, artificial intelligence will now complete many basic and advanced activities, increasing efficiency and security in the $300 trillion global real estate market. For instance, investors can find their dream home without realtors or agents. PCHAIN’s AI can help investors filter available properties with its advanced filtering system, enabling buyers to use advanced filters like anticipated returns on investment to search for properties that fit their investment plans. PCHAIN’s AI also offers proper predictive analysis for all investors on the decentralized platform. The AI’s data-based predictive analysis will help investors access market trends, possible yields, and undervalued properties in areas with potential growth. Why the crypto presale could be the next crypto success story Analysts believe the crypto presale could be the next success story in real estate due to the impacts it sets to have in a trillion-dollar sector. Analysts further state that this project could absorb more than 10% of the global $300 trillion sector. Also, the crypto presale can potentially deliver a 32,586% gain by early 2025. In addition, several positive developments have been made around the crypto presale project, which has affirmed investors’ conviction in it. For instance, the CoinMarketCap listing and the positive BlockAudit review show the project’s credibility. Now could be the best time to invest in PropiChain PropiChain’s integration of artificial intelligence, blockchain, and the Metaverse makes it a unique and perfect real estate marketplace. These tools work together to simplify and improve real estate investment. It is still possible to join, as the second stage of the crypto presale presents another massive opportunity for investors to gain an early mover advantage. The crypto presale round 2 is going at a discounted price of $0.011, the cheapest entry price anyone will get. With the forecasted 32,586% gain, an early investment of $800 will yield more than $250,000.

37589346,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/what-is-proof-of-green-the-fedrok-solution-to-blockchains-carbon-problem,1734101189,What Is Proof of Green? The Fedrok Solution to Blockchain's Carbon Problem,"The widespread adoption of blockchain and Web3 technologies has generated both excitement and concern. On the one hand, blockchain promises noteworthy changes across industries. On the other hand, it also carries a significant environmental cost. Traditional blockchain systems, particularly those using Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, are notorious for their high energy consumption and carbon footprints. Despite efforts to reduce emissions through alternatives like Proof of Stake (PoS), PoW-based networks like Bitcoin remain major contributors to global energy consumption. This is where Fedrok AG’s Proof of Green (PoG) consensus mechanism steps in. But what exactly does PoG offer, and how does it change blockchain’s environmental narrative? Let's find out. The Environmental Cost of Traditional Blockchain Blockchain’s energy consumption has long been a concern, especially for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum (before its shift to Proof of Stake). Proof of Work (PoW), the consensus mechanism used by Bitcoin, requires miners to solve complex puzzles, which demand immense computational power and vast amounts of energy. Bitcoin alone is estimated to consume over 121.36 TWh annually , enough to power all households in the United Kingdom for a year. This heavy reliance on fossil fuels in many mining regions only increases the environmental impact and contributes significantly to global carbon emissions. Meanwhile, European regulatory frameworks like MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) are increasingly pushing for more sustainable practices across the crypto sector. In response to these pressures, new consensus mechanisms like Proof of Green (PoG) are emerging as environmentally conscious alternatives to traditional energy-intensive systems. What Is Proof of Green? Proof of Green (PoG) is a Layer 1 blockchain consensus mechanism developed by Fedrok AG , a new Swiss-registered blockchain firm founded by entrepreneur Walid Ouhida. Rooted in Switzerland’s renowned standards of trust, precision, and environmental responsibility, Fedrok AG aims to reduce the environmental impact of blockchain technology while upholding decentralization and security. Built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), PoG ensures compatibility with Ethereum's decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, offering a seamless and sustainable alternative for developers worldwide. Unlike traditional Proof of Work systems that reward miners for solving cryptographic puzzles, PoG bridges blockchain mining and sustainability. It allows miners to continue their existing operations while incentivizing greener practices. Every transaction processed through the Fedrok blockchain achieves a corresponding carbon offset, which makes the network carbon-neutral. The system works through three main components: First, miners receive FDK tokens, Fedrok’s native cryptocurrency, as rewards for using renewable energy sources. These tokens are directly tied to real-world carbon credits, giving them tangible environmental value. Second, the system tracks and verifies renewable energy usage to ensure transparency and prevent issues like double counting and fraud. Third, it creates a marketplace where these carbon credits can be traded, integrating with trusted sustainability projects worldwide to make green mining financially attractive. The Impact of Proof of Green The introduction of Proof of Green extends beyond just creating another consensus mechanism. Its implementation has the potential to transform multiple aspects of both the blockchain industry and global environmental efforts. By aligning with global sustainability goals, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement and corporate ESG frameworks, PoG integrates blockchain technology into broader environmental initiatives. This makes it a viable tool not only for reducing emissions but also for supporting long-term decarbonization objectives.For miners, PoG offers benefits beyond earning FDK tokens. Transitioning to renewable energy sources can lower operational costs, especially where clean energy is more affordable than fossil fuels. Access to the integrated carbon credit marketplace allows miners to monetize their environmental contributions, creating new revenue streams to offset green energy investments. Market Transformation and Carbon Credit Evolution PoG fundamentally changes the economics of cryptocurrency mining by introducing financial incentives for sustainable practices. Traditional mining operations can now align with green energy solutions, reducing carbon footprints while gaining competitive advantages. Additionally, PoG addresses longstanding issues in the carbon credit market, such as fragmentation and inconsistent standards. By integrating blockchain technology, it offers transparency and standardization, encouraging participation and improving market efficiency. Broader Challenges and Opportunities Despite its potential, the adoption of PoG faces challenges, including upfront costs for transitioning to renewable energy, particularly in regions with underdeveloped infrastructure. Environmental auditing and certification must also balance rigor with efficiency to prevent greenwashing and incentivize participation. Mining pools must adapt their infrastructure to support environmental verification alongside traditional processes. However, early adopters of green mining practices are already demonstrating financial benefits, encouraging broader industry shifts. Mining pools, once focused on hash power alone, are increasingly prioritizing environmental credentials as a key differentiator, driving sustainable operations forward. PoG also aligns blockchain technology with global environmental goals and regulatory frameworks. Transparent verification mechanisms provide a framework for compliance with tightening regulations, such as the EU’s MiCA, enabling blockchain operations to remain both profitable and sustainable. The development of carbon credit markets plays a critical role, and PoG has the potential to unify fragmented systems, establishing global standards that enhance market efficiency and participation. With growing public awareness of environmental issues and the increasing demand for sustainable investment opportunities, PoG can capture the attention of institutional investors who are becoming more focused on ESG criteria. By addressing ESG criteria and offering an environmentally responsible blockchain solution, PoG is well-placed to attract funding from impact investors and financial institutions prioritizing sustainability. Conclusion Proof of Green represents a big step forward in addressing blockchain’s environmental challenges. By integrating sustainable practices directly into its consensus mechanism, PoG offers a practical solution to one of the most pressing issues in the blockchain space: energy consumption and carbon emissions. Fedrok AG’s approach not only makes blockchain operations more environmentally responsible but also aligns them with broader global sustainability goals, such as those outlined in the Paris Agreement and emerging regulatory frameworks like MiCA. The Swiss-engineered design emphasizes transparency, scalability, and integration with existing systems, making PoG a viable model for industry-wide adoption. By turning environmental responsibility into an operational advantage, PoG demonstrates how blockchain technology can evolve to meet the demands of a more sustainable future. In an era where sustainability is non-negotiable, PoG positions blockchain as a key player in the global shift toward greener technologies.

37589342,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109573,1734101141,"Binance CEO Considers UAE for Global Headquarters, No Final Decision Yet","Binance CEO Considers UAE for Global Headquarters, No Final Decision Yet Richard Teng , the CEO of Binance Exchange , hinted that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is being seriously considered as the location for the company’s global headquarters. Speaking at Abu Dhabi Finance Week , Teng emphasized that while the UAE presents an “attractive” option, no final decision has been made . Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has been exploring potential jurisdictions for its global HQ amidst increasing scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Why the UAE Is an “Attractive” Option The UAE has been positioning itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation, offering several advantages to crypto firms: 1. Proactive Regulatory Environment The UAE has introduced crypto-friendly regulations , including a licensing framework for digital asset providers in Dubai and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) . Regulatory clarity makes it easier for companies like Binance to operate and scale their businesses. 2. Strategic Location Situated at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa, the UAE provides Binance with a central location to manage its global operations. 3. Growing Blockchain Ecosystem The UAE hosts a thriving blockchain community, supported by initiatives like the Dubai Blockchain Strategy 2020 and the Abu Dhabi Blockchain Initiative . Challenges and Considerations for Binance While the UAE’s regulatory environment is appealing, Binance faces several factors that may influence its decision: 1. Regulatory Scrutiny Binance has faced challenges from regulators in major markets like the U.S. and Europe, raising the importance of choosing a jurisdiction with a balanced regulatory approach. 2. Global Operations A UAE headquarters must support Binance’s extensive global operations, including markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. 3. Competitive Landscape Other jurisdictions, such as Hong Kong , Singapore , and Switzerland , remain in contention, offering their own regulatory and logistical advantages. Insights from Richard Teng’s Statement Teng avoided commenting on Binance’s: U.S. Operations : The company faces ongoing regulatory challenges in the U.S. Nigeria Litigation : Binance is dealing with legal disputes and regulatory concerns in Africa’s largest crypto market. Co-Founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) : Teng noted that he speaks with CZ “very infrequently,” leaving questions about Zhao’s current role within Binance unanswered. These statements highlight Binance’s strategic focus on establishing a strong operational base while navigating global regulatory complexities. The Implications of a UAE Headquarters If Binance chooses the UAE as its global HQ, it would have several implications for the exchange and the broader cryptocurrency market: 1. Increased Institutional Trust A UAE headquarters would reinforce Binance’s reputation as a compliant and regulated entity, boosting confidence among institutional investors. 2. Strengthened Regional Presence The UAE’s location would enhance Binance’s influence in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which is witnessing rapid crypto adoption. 3. Regulatory Benchmark By aligning with UAE regulations, Binance could set a benchmark for operating in emerging markets with clear crypto frameworks. Conclusion While the UAE is an appealing contender for Binance’s global headquarters, the company remains cautious in its decision-making process. The move would signify Binance’s commitment to operating within a clear regulatory framework while leveraging the UAE’s strategic advantages. As Binance continues to expand its global footprint, the choice of its headquarters will play a critical role in shaping its future and its position in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

His actions… pic.twitter.com/6NgdK1qHt4 — Coinwaft (@coinwaft) December 13, 2024 Despite substantial profits, the investor systematically falsified his tax returns filed between 2017 and 2019, concealing profits and an additional $650,000 in Bitcoin transactions. Ahlgren employed sophisticated methods to conceal his activities, including wallet transfers, crypto mixers , and in-person cash transactions. His 2017 tax returns also reportedly contained false information about his Bitcoin purchase costs, allowing him to evade over $1 million in taxes. The court sentenced Ahlgren to two years in prison, one year of supervised release, and restitution payments totaling $1.1 million for these crimes. How Will the Sentence Impact Other US Investors? Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Stuart Goldberg highlighted the case’s significance as the “first criminal tax evasion prosecution centered solely on cryptocurrency.” Following the conviction, Lucy Tran, who leads the IRS Criminal Investigation team, warned that despite popular belief in criminal circles, cryptocurrency transactions are not beyond the reach of law enforcement. Tan remarked, “Ahlgren will serve time because he believed his cryptocurrency transactions were untraceable.” The case, involving unreported Bitcoin sales worth approximately $4 million, underscores mounting regulatory efforts to address crypto-related tax evasion. Similar Cases of Bitcoin Tax Evasion The rise in crypto-related tax offenses has been a growing concern for regulators worldwide. Earlier this year, Roger Ver, widely known as “Bitcoin Jesus,” was charged with avoiding over $48 million in taxes after selling $240 million worth of cryptocurrency. Ver’s case was further complicated by his decision to renounce U.S. citizenship in 2014, which allegedly allowed him to bypass the “exit tax” requirement. These developments are not isolated. In April, Guy Ficco, the Criminal Investigation Chief at the IRS, warned of the surge in cryptocurrency-related tax evasion cases . Ficco noted that crypto assets, often used in fraud and money laundering schemes, have long been part of IRS investigations. However, the increased adoption of digital currencies has made the tax collection body’s oversight a higher priority.

Following its hard-won battle against the SEC, Ripple is stronger than ever and has sparked new investor confidence. In just days, the coin jumped from a low of $0.60 to $2.40, effectively pricing in a surge of demand from final holders. Some market analysts believe the price may increase as Ripple's use extends to other countries. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap XRP is ideal for cross-border money movements. More and more banks recognise what a good tool it is, becoming secure anchors in Crypto for the long haul. At the same time, however, XRP has its dangers. In this risky and uncertain market, it remains a question of whether or not regulatory hurdles and general business instability could hamper the altcoin's growth. Ethereum Price Prediction: The King Of Utility The second largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, Ethereum has managed to stay at the top of the crypto table. With ETH price now teetering on the edge of $3.944, growth is steady, and widespread staking activity helps ensure hurdles are crossed generously. Data proves that close to one-third of Ethereum's supply is staked already—this drives home not only profitability but investor trust in our network's future return ability. 1-month XRP price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Ethereum's versatility is the key to its success. From decentralized finance (DeFi) to NFTs, it serves as the backbone for countless blockchain applications. Recent upcoming Ethereum Spot ETF inflows of more than $500 million further confirm its strong market position. Despite dominating the market, Ethereum faces off against newer, more scalable blockchains like Solana and Cardano. Yeti Ouro (YETIO): The New Star On The Block While XRP and Ethereum dominate headlines, Yeti Ouro is quietly becoming a top contender. The new altcoin is designed to power a unique Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming ecosystem. Yeti Ouro recently crossed the $1 million milestone in its presale, with investors rushing to secure tokens before the next price increase. Yeti Ouro's gaming platform, ""Yeti Go,"" is a fast-paced Unreal Engine racing game. Players earn rewards in YETIO while navigating chaotic, action-packed environments. The development team has collaborated with industry-leading designers and sound engineers to deliver an immersive experience. Yeti Ouro's token burn mechanism and staking features make it a compelling choice for both gamers and investors. Why Investors Are Betting On Yeti Ouro Yeti Ouro’s early success is compared to Shiba Inu's and Dogecoin's meteoric rise in their initial stages. However, unlike meme coins, Yeti Ouro offers tangible utility through its P2E gaming ecosystem. The YETIO presale is in its final days, with only a small percentage of tokens left at the introductory price. As the gaming sector continues to grow, Yeti Ouro is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend and offer investors substantial gains. Conclusion XRP and Ethereum remain strong pillars of the crypto market, each offering unique advantages. XRP's focus on financial institutions and Ethereum's robust ecosystem make them attractive options for long-term holders. However, the rise of Yeti Ouro introduces a fresh narrative in the altcoin space. With its innovative P2E gaming model and rapid presale success, YETIO stands out as a high-potential investment. Early adopters of innovative projects like Yeti Ouro may see exponential returns as the crypto market evolves.

The company attributed its reasons for focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to limited market exposure. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas quoted Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematic and Active Equity ETFs at BlackRock, speaking about the untapped potential of Bitcoin and Ethereum during the event. “ We’re really just at the tip of the iceberg with Bitcoin and especially Ethereum, ” Jacobs remarked. He further noted that only a small fraction of BlackRock’s clients currently own the firm’s Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, so the company will commit to expanding the reach of these products rather than introducing new altcoin-focused ETFs. BlackRock’s impact on the spot Bitcoin ETF market remains well-documented , and its presence in the Ethereum ETF market is steadily growing. The BlackRock iShares Ethereum ETF (ETHA), launched on November 29, has attracted net inflows exceeding $1.3 billion in just ten trading days. 📢 JUST IN: BlackRock's #Ethereum ETF has exceeded $3 billion in inflows, expert forecast ETH price increase to $15,000! 🚀 pic.twitter.com/jQq7MTamWd — Ethprofit.eth 🦇🔊 (@Ethprofit) December 13, 2024 Cumulatively, the fund has garnered an impressive $3.19 billion since its inception, bringing total net assets to $3.81 billion. ETF crypto adoption is growing During the discussion, Mike Venuto, Chief Investment Officer at Tidal, also weighed in on the increasing interest in innovative ETF strategies involving Bitcoin. “ We have people coming to us all the time trying to pitch ‘Bitcoin + something else’ ETFs, ” Venuto shared. “Y ou’re not diversified unless there are things in your portfolio that you hate, ” he added. The Tidal CIO predicted that the integration of crypto assets with traditional market giants like Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETF offerings is inevitable. “ Every options strategy you can think of is going to be tied to Bitcoin, Nvidia, Tesla, and MicroStrategy in ETFs. It’s coming .” Bloomberg ETF analyst Balchunas noted that ETF assets grew by 32% globally in 2024, with Bitcoin ETFs making up about 2% of the figure. Here you go: ETFs grew by $3.7T in 2024. Bitcoin ETFs were about 2% of that number. On one hand, amazing for new category.

BlackRock ETH ETF inflows hit records Meanwhile, as BlackRock’s ETHA leads the charge in breaking records, other Ethereum ETFs are also driving the Ethereum ETF market forward. Several market data trackers show Grayscale’s Mini Ether ETF (ETH) and Fidelity’s FETH have also seen substantial inflows, recording $603 million and $1.37 billion, respectively, since their launch. Collectively, all Ether ETFs have attracted $2.24 billion in inflows since their debut in late July. This surge comes despite major outflows from the Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), which saw withdrawals totaling $3.5 billion during the same period.

37589040,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98827,1734100659,Glassnode Founders Predict Major Rally for Solana if Key Resistance is Surpassed,"Solana (SOL), the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could be on the verge of a significant breakout, according to the co-founders of Glassnode, known as “Negentropic” on X (formerly Twitter). In a Thursday tweet, the analysts highlighted SOL’s recent rebound toward $230, which unfolded within a descending triangle pattern, calling the price action “highly encouraging.” “SOL hit the marked zone and rebounded toward $230. If it surpasses $235 on a daily timeframe, it could break the price compression, targeting the previous high of $264. Will SOL reach new heights?” they wrote. Additionally, they emphasized that Solana’s daily RSI remains neutral and well below overbought territory, signaling favorable conditions for further upward momentum. The duo also pointed out the potential for spillover effects into Solana ecosystem tokens like JUP and WIF if SOL sustains its rally. Other analysts share similar optimism. Popular analyst RLinda offered a slightly different perspective, emphasizing the importance of Solana’s ongoing consolidation between $221 and $265. Notably, the analyst described this consolidation phase as a “healthy and necessary” development for sustained growth, supported by favorable macroeconomic drivers like Bitcoin’s climb past $105,000, altcoin season trends, and supportive regulatory policies. RLinda further argued that a breakout above $265, reinforced by bullish support, could open the door for Solana to explore new highs with minimal resistance. “Once $265 is breached, the path becomes clear for SOL to test uncharted territory,” she noted, highlighting the consolidation phase as a foundation for long-term bullish momentum. Elsewhere analyst Ali Martinez presented an even more ambitious forecast for Solana, predicting a surge to $4,000 with the emergence of a “cup and handle” pattern. That said, despite this optimism, Solana’s performance has been relatively subdued compared to the explosive gains of assets like XRP and ADA. In the past month, SOL has risen by 9.45%, a modest uptick influenced by external factors, including regulatory developments. Notably, last week, the Solana-based platform Pump.fun, known for its meme token ecosystem, faced regulatory scrutiny from the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Following a warning from the agency, Pump.fun restricted access to its site for UK users, citing compliance with local regulations. “This company may provide or promote financial services or products without our permission. You should avoid dealing with this company and beware of fraud,” the FCA stated on its website . The platform, which generated record revenue of $93 million in November, a 208% increase from October, has been a significant contributor to Solana’s ecosystem growth. However, the temporary shutdown of its streaming services in late November led to a one-third decline in revenue, casting a shadow over Solana’s performance. Nevertheless, despite facing regulatory pressures, Solana has also emerged as the most attractive blockchain for developers in 2024. According to a report by Electric Capital, of the 39,148 developers entering the crypto industry this year, 7,625 chose Solana, marking the first time since 2016 outpacing Ethereum in developer growth and underscoring its growing appeal. At press time, SOL was trading at $223, reflecting a 3.37% drop in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,ADA | SOL,ADA | ALTCOIN | BUSINESS | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/glassnode-founders-predict-major-rally-for-solana-if-key-resistance-is-surpassed/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

37634711,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109575,1734100478,Ethereum Eyes $5K Amid Surging On-Chain Activity and Institutional Demand,"Ethereum Eyes $5K Amid Surging On-Chain Activity and Institutional Demand Ethereum (ETH) is on track to breach the $5,000 price milestone , supported by strong on-chain activity, increased decentralized application (dApp) usage, and rising institutional demand. Analysts from CryptoQuant , as cited by The Block , suggest that if current trends persist, Ethereum could achieve new highs, driven by its deflationary mechanisms and growing appeal among investors. Key Drivers of Ethereum’s Price Surge 1. Robust On-Chain Metrics Ethereum’s blockchain activity has surged significantly in 2024, with metrics pointing to a healthy and growing ecosystem: Daily Transactions : Transaction volumes have increased, reflecting heightened network usage. dApp Usage : The popularity of decentralized applications, particularly in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs, continues to drive adoption. Fee Burning Mechanism : Ethereum’s deflationary pressure, introduced by the EIP-1559 upgrade, burns a portion of transaction fees, reducing supply and supporting price growth. 2. Institutional Demand Spot Ethereum ETFs : Inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have reached an impressive $1.95 billion over the past 13 days , bringing total assets under management (AUM) to $13.18 billion . Rising Adoption : Institutional players view Ethereum as a strategic investment, enhancing its appeal beyond retail markets. 3. ETH/BTC Ratio Gains Ethereum has recently outperformed Bitcoin, with the ETH/BTC ratio climbing 2.82% in the past day , signaling stronger relative growth. Ethereum’s Deflationary Dynamics Impact of Fee Burning The EIP-1559 upgrade, introduced in 2021, replaced Ethereum’s previous fee model with a mechanism that burns a portion of gas fees. This creates deflationary pressure by reducing the circulating supply. Current Deflationary Trends Network Activity : As dApp usage and transaction volumes rise, more ETH is burned, accelerating supply reduction. Price Support : A deflationary ETH supply complements rising demand, supporting sustained price growth. Institutional Adoption: A Major Catalyst Spot Ethereum ETFs Ethereum spot ETFs have gained significant traction among institutional investors: Recent Inflows : $1.95 billion in 13 days highlights Ethereum’s growing acceptance in traditional finance. Total AUM : Spot Ethereum ETFs now manage over $13.18 billion , showcasing increasing confidence in ETH as an investment vehicle. Broader Institutional Interest DeFi Exposure : Institutions are drawn to Ethereum’s role as the backbone of decentralized finance. Alternative Store of Value : Ethereum’s utility and network effects offer a compelling alternative to Bitcoin’s narrative as digital gold. Ethereum’s Competitive Edge Ethereum’s price growth is driven by its multifaceted utility: Smart Contract Dominance : Ethereum remains the leading platform for decentralized applications. Developer Ecosystem : A vibrant community continuously innovates, ensuring Ethereum stays ahead in blockchain advancements. Interoperability : Layer-2 solutions and cross-chain capabilities enhance Ethereum’s scalability and usability. Challenges and Risks to Watch Despite its bullish outlook, Ethereum faces several potential risks: Regulatory Uncertainty : The classification of ETH as a commodity or security remains a point of contention, especially in the U.S. Scalability Issues : While Ethereum 2.0 addresses many concerns, the network must continue improving to handle growing demand. Competition : Emerging layer-1 blockchains, such as Solana and Avalanche, pose competitive threats. The Path to $5K and Beyond Ethereum’s price trajectory depends on several key factors: Continued On-Chain Growth : Sustained transaction volumes and dApp adoption will drive network value. Institutional Inflows : As more institutions recognize Ethereum’s potential, inflows into ETFs and direct holdings will likely grow. Market Sentiment : Broader crypto market trends, including Bitcoin’s performance, will influence Ethereum’s momentum. Conclusion Ethereum’s march toward $5,000 is underpinned by its robust ecosystem, rising institutional interest, and deflationary supply dynamics. With daily transactions and dApp usage at all-time highs, and spot ETFs attracting billions in inflows, Ethereum is solidifying its position as a leading digital asset. As ETH continues to outperform Bitcoin and gain market share, the $5K milestone appears not just attainable but an indicator of Ethereum’s broader role in shaping the future of decentralized finance and digital innovation.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Justin Sun leveraged cryptocurrency price fluctuations, staking, and cloud mining to build his blockchain empire; now platforms like CrytocoinMiner make cloud mining accessible to all. Table of Contents What is Cloud Mining? What is CrytocoinMiner? What kind of investors are suitable for CrytocoinMiner cloud mining? How much money do users need to invest to make money with CrytocoinMiner? As everyone knows, Justin Sun is a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. He has used cryptocurrency many times and built his own business empire in the industry. But how did he get the initial investment funds? In fact, he used the market value fluctuations to earn the price difference of cryptocurrency. If there were no cryptocurrency, how would he earn the price difference? Then we have to mention the projects he has invested in, that is, staking cryptocurrency and cloud mining. But how to stake without cryptocurrency? The answer is to participate in cloud mining to get more cryptocurrency. What is Cloud Mining? To participate in cloud mining, we need to understand what cloud mining is. Cloud mining refers to the method of mining cryptocurrencies by renting cloud computing resources. Unlike traditional mining machines, users can rent computing power from the CrytocoinMiner platform (usually in the form of a lease contract), and the CrytocoinMiner platform that provides services will operate the mining machine in a remote data center. In the end, users will receive corresponding cryptocurrency rewards based on the proportion of computing power they rent, usually 1.2%-6%. What is CrytocoinMiner? CrytocoinMiner is the world’s top Bitcoin miner. It was founded in January 2018 and is headquartered in London, UK. It has more than 3.7 million members worldwide. Since its establishment, the company has been focusing on Bitcoin mining business. At present, the company not only has the world’s most advanced Bitcoin mining technology, but also deploys the world’s largest computing power facilities. According to statistics, the company contributes about 4.5% of the global hash rate. What kind of investors are suitable for CrytocoinMiner cloud mining? CrytocoinMiner cloud mining is favored by investors for its small investment, low risk, high returns and simple operation. Whether users have investment experience or not, they can easily get started and make money quickly. How much money do users need to invest to make money with CrytocoinMiner? 1. Register to make money, get $10 for free when registering, and get $0.5 in daily interest income by signing in every day. 2. Buy contracts to get higher returns. CrytocoinMiner has launched a variety of computing power contracts with a daily interest rate of up to 3%. 3. Users can choose a contract that suits their current financial ability and start making money. For example, the following contracts pay interest daily: Example: Invest $10,000 to purchase $10,000 worth of BTC [Advanced Computing Power], with a contract term of 50 days and a contract daily interest rate of 1.75%. The amount of passive income users can get every day after purchase = $10,000*1.75%=$175. After 50 days, the principal and income = $10,000+$175*50=$10,000+$8,750=$18,750 (Different contract computing power values, different investment amounts and terms, and different incomes, please log in to the CrytocoinMiner official website to view more contracts) Reminder: CrytocoinMiner ‘s innovative business has been imitated by some companies since its launch, please be careful to identify.

Cheap altcoins that could rally this cycle,"Bitcoin is back above $100,000 after a slight correction early this week. A 2024 Pew Research Center poll shows that 17% of U.S. adults say they have ever invested in, traded, or used a cryptocurrency. This statistic has been unchanged since 2021. Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000 has resulted in fear of missing out among many investors. The Fear and Greed Index that gauges market sentiment reads “extreme greed.” However, sidelined traders looking to enter trades could consider cheap altcoins as alternatives to the largest cryptocurrency in this market cycle. Table of Contents Trump’s crypto plans catalyze gains in Bitcoin and altcoins Bitcoin options data suggests rally could extend Altcoins could rally as altseason returns Cheap altcoins to consider this cycle Strategic considerations Trump’s crypto plans catalyze gains in Bitcoin and altcoins The incoming U.S. President Donald Trump told CNBC’s Jim Cramer at the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, “We’re gonna do something great with crypto because we don’t want China, or anybody else … but others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” Trump answered questions about the potential strategic Bitcoin reserve, stating that there would be something great, fueling a positive sentiment among crypto traders. Previously, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and nomination of crypto-friendly candidates for key positions like AI & Crypto Czar and U.S. SEC Chair have assuaged crypto market participants’ regulatory and policy-related concerns. Bitcoin made a comeback above $100,000 after its correction earlier this week; altcoins rallied alongside the largest cryptocurrency since mid-week. As the market recovers from the flash crash, cheap altcoins pose an investment alternative for traders who may have missed Dollar cost averaging to buy Bitcoin this cycle. The launch of Google’s new computing chip raised concerns among crypto traders regarding the security of their Bitcoin holdings. However, there is no significant impact on price. Addressing these concerns, Dario Lo Buglio, Head of Blockchain & Co-founder of Brickken, told crypto.news: “The recent achievement in quantum computing made by Google only shows what we already knew for years. The majority of the encryption used in everyday tasks from banks to data processing are based on encryption techniques which take the assumption that quantum computing would have taken too many years to practically be an issue today . A recent research from Sussex university suggests that one will need a quantum computer with 13M qubits, and what Google achieved is 105 qubits […].This should remind us to update our system to quantum resistant encryption schemes as fast as possible.” Bitcoin options data suggests rally could extend Options data paints a bullish picture for the cryptocurrency with a $2 trillion market cap.

This paves the way for Ethereum beta plays, Layer 2 tokens, staking tokens, Ethereum-based meme coins, DeFi tokens like AAVE , Pendle ( PENDLE ), Maker ( MKR ), Ethereum Name Service ( ENS ), and Pepe ( PEPE ), among others. Gaming tokens and Artificial intelligence tokens could see a resurgence in demand among traders with rising AI relevance. Bitcoin-based meme coins could compete with Ethereum, Solana , and XRP -based memes. Alvin Kan, COO of Bitget Research told crypto.news: “The emergence of new meme coins on platforms like XRPLedger and Solana introduces increased competition for established or blue-chip meme coins like DOGE, SHIB, FLOKI, BONK, and WIF. This competition can potentially dilute the market attention and capital that would otherwise flow to these legacy tokens.[…].The introduction of new tokens might stimulate overall interest in the meme coin sector, potentially benefiting all meme coins by attracting new investors to the market.” Aerodrome Finance ( AERO ) is a token of a liquidity hub in the Base ecosystem. AERO averages over $1 million in fees a day, and is a leading decentralized exchange on Base, an Ethereum beta play. AERO ranks 92nd in market capitalization.

The narrative of “capital rotation” does not hold as much ground in the ongoing bull run. Options metrics signal Bitcoin price could hover close to the psychologically important $100,000 level. The return of altcoin season could send prices higher, however there is always a likelihood of a market correction if Bitcoin observes a flash crash. Ryan Lee, Chief Analyst, Bitget Research, told crypto.news: “Bitcoin’s rising dominance could temporarily divert investment away from altcoins. However, history suggests that once Bitcoin stabilizes, altcoins often experience a resurgence. Investors frequently enter Bitcoin at new highs, anticipating sustained upward momentum, which could further propel its price in the short term.” Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice.

Since these significant events, Bitcoin (BTC) finally broke through the $100,000 level to set a new ATH of $103,900. While the market corrected, causing BTC to dip below $100,000, it has recovered, allowing BTC to trade above this vital level once again. Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its position as the most trusted digital asset, setting the pace for the altcoin market to follow. As the dominant store of value, BTC remains the go-to choice for institutional investors, with its recent run to an ATH of $103,900 underscoring why it is held in such high regard. Large-Cap Altcoins Make Major Gains Crypto enthusiasts have waited years and years for BTC to reach $100,000 finally and are continuously searching for an investment opportunity that will skyrocket with BTC’s run. While BTC sets the pace for the rest of the market, we have seen many projects surpass Bitcoin’s growth, with this number increasing daily. Bitcoin will forever remain the G.O.A.T and is seen by many as the digital equivalent of gold. Despite BTC’s strong reputation, altcoins are more likely to deliver more significant gains as we approach the altcoin season. Some of the biggest altcoin opportunities include the ever-popular Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA). The latest newcomer from the Solana network, Husky Inu (HINU) , also emerged as a significant player in the industry. Ripple’s XRP Rallies Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the fourth-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $136 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit emerged and now trades for $2.29, a whopping 240% surge in the past month. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which it paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges, such as Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Gemini, choosing to delist XRP, causing the price to tank. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” XRP’s price gained over 3.9% in the past week, with a bullish outlook for its future. Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF. Cardano’s ADA Gains Almost 100% in the 30-day Charts Cardano (ADA) is another major gainer since Donald Trump’s election victory. On-chain metrics show Cardano’s weekly active addresses elevated since the crypto market rally triggered by Trump’s win on November 6 began. The surge in network usage and whale buying activity has resulted in a bullish outlook for ADA. ADA further surged after the Cardano blockchain developers, the Cardano Foundation, released an updated proposal for the Cardano Constitution to improve network governance. The revised proposal includes changes to constitutional workshops, social media discussion, and expert and community feedback. The changes aim to “improve the accessibility and clarity of the Cardano governance framework,” shifting its focus to a less technical audience. Interest in Cardano (ADA) surged after its founder, Charles Hoskinson, revealed plans to help shape US crypto policy under Donald Trump’s incoming administration. ADA gained over 95% in the past month and currently trades at $1.11. Solana (SOL) Market Cap Exceeds $106 Billion Solana (SOL) is one of the hottest altcoins this year, with gains exceeding 233% in the past year. The Solana network is the go-to platform for memecoin developments thanks to its ability to handle high TPS at low transaction fees. The power of the Solana blockchain and the network’s robust and active community make it the ideal space for memecoin development. Solana (SOL) has become a formidable player in the crypto space, and now it is targeting a considerable part of Ethereum’s (ETH) market share. SOL reached a new ATH of $263.70 on November 23 as Solana ETF regulatory filings surged after Gary Gensler confirmed his departure from the SEC. SOL lost some ground since reaching its ATH and is now the 5th largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $107.12 billion, currently trading for $223.55. Newcomer Husky Inu (HINU) Completes Third Presale Round As BTC hovers around the $100,000 level and large-cap altcoins make good gains, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by leveraging the power of this robust blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu recently completed its third fundraising round and, since going live, has generated over $618,000. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. HINU tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 and are expected to surge once listed on major exchanges.

Table of Contents DTX Exchange offers massive profit potential for investors Why Solana could reclaim its ATH soon Why Cardano could be the next big breakout Maximize gains with DTX Exchange, Solana, and Cardano The crypto market presents lots of opportunities as Solana (SOL) gains momentum toward the $240 level and Cardano (ADA) shows an amazing surge. Concurrently, traders are drawn to a distinctive exchange platform that provides not only speed and security but also the chance to profit massively from trading and also take a share of the platform’s profits. Could these altcoins provide even more gains in the next few months as Solana shows indications of recovering its all-time high and Cardano generates waves with its current breakout? And while DTX Exchange (DTX) provides traders with amazing advantages, what distinguishes this platform above the many others in the crowded crypto scene? DTX Exchange offers massive profit potential for investors With its amazing execution speeds, which guarantee trades are completed in only 0.04 seconds, so users never miss important market opportunities, DTX Exchange is rapidly becoming one of the best platforms available for traders. Built on strong security and compliance requirements, the platform has gained confidence by means of its SOLIDProof audit. One special advantage the platform provides for DTX token holders is getting a part of the trading fee income generated by DTX Exchange. DTX delivers an atmosphere where traders may maximize their gains while enjoying a wide range of tools and financial instruments, including stocks, crypto, and forex by adding extra benefits including rakebacks, bonuses, and refund for net losses depending on account size.

DTX presents a good offer for investors with special features like the VIP Rebate System, which lets customers become exclusive partners and earn up to 3% of daily profits. With the DTX token valued at $0.12 in its 6th presale round, this is a chance to get in before its expected 30x increase upon listing on multiple exchanges. Why Solana could reclaim its ATH soon With the Solana price ranging between $248 and $202, the altcoin has shown resilience despite recent volatility. The Solana price swiftly rebounded, inspiring hope among investors after momentarily falling to $204 following the breakout from the $230 support level. With Solana currently rising toward the $240 mark, the quick rebound from the $204 zone has given hope for a significant surge. Especially as the monthly Solana price chart shows a double bottom pattern, a classic bullish formation indicating possible additional gains, this powerful comeback and following bullish momentum underline Solana’s status as one of the best altcoins to buy during the current market cycle. Technical data like the MACD and Moving Averages point to an upcoming upswing, supporting Solana’s positive view. The Solana price chart shows that the altcoin is still 13% below its all-time high (ATH) of $263, but if upward momentum keeps building, analysts expect the altcoin may rapidly return to this level soon. Solana is among the promising altcoins to watch this quarter thanks to strong community support and bullish chart patterns. You might also like: NVIDIA millionaire bets on SOL recovery as DTX eyes 55,000% gains Why Cardano could be the next big breakout With its amazing 90% increase over the past month, the recent Cardano price movement has drawn the interest of investors despite a weekly consolidation between $1.27 and $0.91. Supported by strong community sentiment and technical indicators pointing to a possible positive continuation, analysts remain hopeful as Cardano consolidates. Rising from the crucial $1 support zone, the Cardano price is moving above $1.1, implying growing buying activity. With many projecting a rise toward the $2 level shortly, Cardano’s tenacity in the face of bearish pressure and its capacity to hold critical support levels make it one of the altcoins to watch for. The technical study supports the altcoin’s optimistic view, even more, when buy signs from the MACD and Moving Averages start to show on the Cardano price chart. Though the Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin is still more than 60% behind its ATH of $3.10 hit in 2021, analysts are projecting a fresh ATH in this market cycle. Cardano is among the best altcoins to buy right now since it combines strong investor confidence with attractive price action positions. Maximize gains with DTX Exchange, Solana, and Cardano The crypto market is full of possibilities as Solana gathers pace toward recovering its ATH and Cardano shows potential for amazing growth. However, the true potential resides in the special qualities of DTX Exchange, which offers traders unequaled benefits with amazing execution speeds, strong security, and the chance to partake in trading fee profits.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | SHIB | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-rally-16000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The project, considered one of the high-profile airdrops for 2024, is now in price discovery mode for its native HYPE token. HYPE continues to gain attention as a potential high-liquidity project. The HYPE token continued its price discovery in December, adding to the social media noise. Hyperliquid has existed as a perpetual futures DEX since May 2023, only gaining more attention as its token generation event and airdrop approached. HYPE traded above $17.90, near its all-time highs, after trading started on December 1, at around $3.31. HYPE has retained its value despite being airdropped to multiple early users. HYPE becomes mindshare leader on social media. The HYPE token and the project gained mindshare along with other big-time narratives, based on Kaito’s social media data. Current top projects/tokens for mindshare: 👑 BTC 2) ETH 3) SOL 4) AIXBT 5) HYPE pic.twitter.com/AJAf01spE2 — Kaito AI 🌊 (@_kaitoai) December 13, 2024 Hyperliquid also helped bring back the meme narrative, which is now ahead of memes in terms of social media mindshare. After a series of airdrops with disappointing value or Sybill attacks, the project somehow managed to achieve a successful token distribution. Since the November 29 airdrop, HYPE continues to grow in influence as well as price action. The recent HYPE token appreciation further boosted the value of the airdrop. It reached 200K addresses, sending out 310M HYPE tokens with a value of $3.90 right after the event. Even relatively mid-range trading on Hyperliquid in the past year made traders eligible for significant gains, especially if they held HYPE for the past two weeks after the launch. The HYPE airdrop also detected up to 27,000 Sybill wallets, operated by around 100 individuals. The Hyperliquid team worked to identify those wallets and decrease their allocated points, thus giving more of the airdropped HYPE to real users. Until recently, Hyperliquid was mostly known to its community and early adopters. The project has more than 110K followers and has gone on to break out with social media hype. Hyperliquid revives demand for DEX derivative trading Hyperliquid aims to revive the perpetual DEX narrative, following the success of Aerodrome on Base. The project mixes decentralized trading with ensured targeted liquidity, leading to highly active and predictable trading pairs. Hyperliquid has already started trading its native HYPE token, in addition to building meme token pairs. The DEX has even added the recently launched Magic Eden (ME) airdrop token, with up to 5X leverage. The HYPE token also trades with up to 3X leverage. Most of the listings on the DEX reflect community demands and sentiment, as the project is an active producer of social media content. Hyperliquid offers perpetual derivatives trading, though pricing is derived via oracles. The activity may be decentralized, but for now, it is not tied to an algorithmic price discovery mechanism. Instead, oracles fetch the prices from centralized exchanges. Hyperliquid also increased its exposure and activity after DeBridge opened virtually limitless deposits to the DEX. Hyperliquid is more similar to dy/dx, another decentralized perpetual DEX. Initially built on Ethereum, dy/dx also plans to migrate to a native L1, to achieve the required speed at a minimal cost. Hyperliquid offers fully on-chain settlement through its L1 technology with instant finality. The chain is not EVM-compatible, though it has already drawn USDC liquidity for its most active trading pair. USDC for perpetual swaps still uses bridging, while Hyperliquid is working on its EVM-compatible version. What is peculiar about Hyperliquid is that it relies on USDC bridged on Arbitrum. Trading on the DEX even before the token launch was one of the main prerequisites for the airdrop. In its early days, Hyperliquid was mostly focused on the native HYPE token. More than 75% of the DEX volumes came from the HYPE/USDC pair, with $182M in daily volumes. The pair boosts the current price discovery of HYPE. To achieve near-instant settlement, the L1 chain produces a block every 200 milliseconds. The exchange already handles real-time token trading and order-based activities. It also simulates order books, again with near-instant settlement on-chain.

37588954,https://blockworks.co/news/crypto-ipos-bringing-back-retail,1734099445,How crypto IPOs could bring back retail,"This is a segment from the Empire newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . The crypto predictions are pouring in for next year, and — if I’m being honest with you — it’s hard to contain the excitement. Or maybe it’s just Friday. Anyway, this morning I’m specifically looking at Bitwise’s predictions, which were released earlier this week. The whole report is worth a read, but for now I’m focused on their forecast that says 2025 will be the year of the crypto IPO. It’s definitely hard to argue with that particular call. On paper, all of the pieces are falling into place. Here are the three things I think support a big year for crypto IPOs: A regulator actually engaging with firms and moving their paperwork forward. Institutional interest and support. Investor appetite. Three simple bullet points, right? Well, not really. For crypto, actually securing green lights to go public demands the perfect storm post-FTX. If you don’t believe me, let’s take a look at Circle. The stablecoin issuer filed a confidential draft of its registration statement with the SEC back in January of this year and yet we’ve seen no movement on its IPO. After years of covering IPOs in my past life, companies who’ve filed their drafts generally publicly file their S-1 in six to eight months, or at least have some sort of movement on that front. Obviously, however, this isn’t always the case. We don’t know what’s happened behind closed doors but I’m still eagerly awaiting Circle’s next filing. And I fully agree with Bitwise that Circle looks like a crypto firm with the most potential to hit the public stage. Outside of Circle, Bitwise rounded out its list with Figure, Kraken, Anchorage and Chainalysis. Adding to that, we already have two companies seeking uplisting on US exchanges (Sol Strategies is looking to uplist on Nasdaq while Exodus is uplisting to NYSE American ) and one company going public through a de-SPAC and, bam, it looks like this prediction should’ve been a Polymarket market. If more of crypto starts going public, it could be a positive for the return of retail. A larger roster of public crypto companies not only lets folks engage with the space without fully diving in — a bonus for a more general audience — but it also builds back much-needed trust. Not to mention, investors would finally be able to look at certain metrics that hadn’t previously been disclosed through documents filed with the SEC. And don’t even get me started on the capital they could unlock. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross. Subscribe to the Empire newsletter .

37588451,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662297,1734099443,"Texas Fixin’ to Start Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, Great News for $STARS Meme Coin Tracker Which Just Broke Through $15M in Presale","Texas is moving forward with plans to introduce a strategic Bitcoin reserve. State Rep. Giovanni Capriglione announced yesterday that he has submitted a bill that will enable the state to accept donations, fees, and taxes in the form of bitcoin, with the condition that it be held for a minimum of five years. “ Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation, ” said Capriglione. “ A strategic bitcoin reserve, investing in bitcoin, would be a win-win for the state. ” Texas is the second US state to consider incorporating Bitcoin into its financial strategy. In November this year, legislation to form the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve was introduced, with plans to allocate up to 10% of its treasury reserves to Bitcoin. This came after the Pennsylvania House of Representatives passed what is informally called the Bitcoin Rights Bill in October, giving Pennsylvania residents the option of Bitcoin as a potential payment method while safeguarding their rights to manage their own cryptocurrency. “ By enacting this legislation, we can make the Commonwealth a friendly place for blockchain innovation and provide our citizens with the tools to engage in the digital economy safely, ” according to Rep. Mike Cabell, who sponsored House Bill 2481 – or the Digital Assets Authorization Act – as it is formally known. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Economy? The moves to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves by both Texas and Pennsylvania are positive news for the cryptocurrency economy, albeit at state-level, not yet federal. However, Dennis Porter – CEO of NPO Satoshi Action Fund , who worked with Capriglione on the draft legislation – is optimistic. “ The state level, in our opinion, is the best place to create political momentum for bitcoin, ” he said in an interview on CNBC New York . “ The very best thing that we can be doing is passing this legislation at the state level, providing political momentum for federal legislation. ” Bitcoin, which has been experiencing a post-US election boom – reaching the $100k milestone – continued to rally following yesterday’s announcement of Texas’ Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, although at the time of writing, it had dipped slightly. “ Over its short history, Bitcoin has seen both major surges and sell-offs, ” asset manager BlackRock noted in a report released earlier this week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF currently manages some $53.8bn in assets. The Black Rock report adds that this volatility, “ plus Bitcoin’s unique characteristics, raises the question of what role it should play in portfolios. ” The financial giant advises that investors place a maximum of 2% of Bitcoin in their portfolio. It’s Not Only Bitcoin That’s In The Pound Seat Bitcoin’s rally is great news for other tokens – because when Bitcoin goes up, they tend to go up, too. And that includes the best meme coins . Take Crypto All-Stars ($STARS) , for instance. This meme coin/DeFi token is currently on presale, and with a 200% APY and excitement surrounding its upcoming MemeVault, Crypto All-Stars is proving to be a massive success so far. $STARS has already raised over $15.3M, but with just seven days left until its official launch, time is running out if you want to buy $STARS at a presale bargain.

37588367,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109577,1734099336,Trump Promises ‘Something Great’ for Crypto,"Trump Promises ‘Something Great’ for Crypto U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has sparked speculation and excitement in the cryptocurrency community with his recent statement about crypto. According to Tree News on X (formerly Twitter), Trump announced plans to “do something great with crypto,” leaving room for interpretation and fueling curiosity about his administration’s potential policies. A New Era for Cryptocurrency in the U.S.? Trump’s statement marks a notable shift from his earlier critical stance on cryptocurrencies, including comments in 2019 where he expressed skepticism about Bitcoin and other digital assets. The president-elect’s evolving views could signal a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies in the U.S. What Could ‘Something Great’ Mean? Regulatory Clarity : Clearer regulations could provide a stable framework for businesses and investors. Support for Innovation : Encouraging blockchain startups and fostering a pro-crypto environment. Integration into Financial Systems : Exploring the role of digital currencies in U.S. monetary policy or infrastructure. Trump’s Evolving Stance on Crypto Past Criticism In 2019, Trump stated on Twitter: “I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies… Unregulated crypto assets can facilitate unlawful behavior.” His administration focused on monitoring crypto markets for compliance with existing financial regulations. Present Shift Trump’s recent statement suggests a reassessment of cryptocurrency’s potential, possibly influenced by: Growing adoption by global financial institutions. The success of the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF market. Rising interest in blockchain innovation across various sectors. The Political Context Bipartisan Interest in Crypto Both Democrats and Republicans have shown interest in crafting crypto legislation, highlighting its bipartisan appeal. Lawmakers like Senator Cynthia Lummis and Representative Patrick McHenry advocate for pro-crypto policies. Economic Implications Crypto innovation could strengthen the U.S. economy, boost job creation, and secure leadership in the global blockchain industry. Potential Policies Under Trump’s Administration While details remain vague, Trump’s administration could focus on: 1. Encouraging Innovation Providing tax incentives for blockchain startups. Creating a national blockchain strategy to compete with initiatives from countries like China and the EU. 2. Regulatory Reform Establishing clearer guidelines for cryptocurrencies to reduce uncertainty. Balancing innovation with investor protection and anti-money laundering measures. 3. Exploring CBDCs Collaborating with the Federal Reserve to develop a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as a countermeasure to China’s digital yuan. Industry Reactions Crypto Community Optimism Trump’s statement has been met with cautious optimism within the crypto space, with many industry leaders hopeful for favorable policy changes. Market Impact Bitcoin and Ethereum prices showed minor fluctuations following the announcement, reflecting heightened market attention. Analysts believe sustained clarity and support could trigger long-term bullish trends. Challenges to Address 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Crypto businesses often face challenges due to inconsistent regulations across federal and state levels. 2. Security Concerns Protecting investors from fraud and ensuring the security of blockchain networks will remain a priority. 3. International Competition The U.S. must stay ahead of other nations that have implemented advanced crypto policies, such as Switzerland and Singapore. Conclusion President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to “do something great with crypto” hints at potential transformative changes for the U.S. cryptocurrency landscape. While the specifics of his plans remain unclear, the statement has ignited hope for regulatory clarity and support for innovation. As the U.S. prepares for a new administration, the global crypto community will watch closely for policy developments that could shape the future of blockchain and digital assets.

Velodrome Finance ( VELO ), one of the biggest players in Optimism’s ( OP ) ecosystem, jumped to a high of $0.0335, up by 810% from its lowest level this year. Its rally brought the total market cap to over $282 million. VELO’s jump happened after Binance, the biggest crypto exchange in the industry, listed its token with a seed tag. That listing will give it exposure to millions of customers who use the Binance platform. Data by CoinGecko shows that most VELO tokens are traded on exchanges like MEXC, OKX, Gate, and XT. As such, because of Binance’s scale, the odds are that its volume will rise in the next few days. Historically, cryptocurrencies rally when they are listed by major exchanges. These gains, however, are often short-lived as the hype eases. Velodrome has become a top player in the decentralized finance industry. Its total value locked has risen to over $100 million, while the DEX volume in the last seven days stood at over $700 million. This makes it bigger than other popular Optimism DEX networks like Uniswap ( UNI ), WOOFI, Beethoven, and Curve Finance. Velodrome Finance has handled over $20 billion in assets cumulatively, a trend that may continue as the crypto bull run accelerates. Most DEX networks, led by Raydium and Uniswap, have seen a sharp increase in volume this year, with their November volume rising to over $371 billion. Velodrome Finance price has more gains to go VELO price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the VELO price has been in a strong uptrend in the past few months. It has recently retested the important resistance level at $0.030, its highest point on May 10. This was an important level since it was the upper side of the cup and handle pattern. It has even completed forming the handle section. C&H is a popular bullish continuation sign. Velodrome price has also moved above the 50-day and 100-day moving averages. Therefore, there is a likelihood that the token will continue rising in the longer term. By measuring the depth of the cup, we can estimate that the VELO price will eventually jump to $0.054, which is about 109% above the current level.",POSITIVE,UNI,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | BNB,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/velodromes-velo-soars-after-binance-listing-as-a-rare-pattern-forms/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37588321.jpeg

37588541,https://zycrypto.com/?p=98824,1734099180,"Ethereum Price On Course To Clinch $5,000 Due To These Two Extremely Bullish Catalysts","While Ethereum is up 79.8% over the past year, that’s measly compared to Bitcoin’s 145% and archnemesis Solana’s 246%. However, analysts are increasingly bullish that Ether is all set to break out of its dullness. Market intelligence firm CryptoQuant predicts that the world’s second-largest crypto by market cap will smash through its current all-time high of $4,878 and hit $5,000 due to growing institutional demand and heightened activity on the Ethereum network. CryptoQuant Targets $5K ETH Price Amid Renewed Investor Interest CryptoQuant said in a December 12 note that inflows to the new Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) had shattered records. Last week, investors poured a staggering $1.2 billion in new cash into Ethereum funds worldwide, marking a new record just a few months after the spot ETH ETFs went live in the U.S. Notably, the ETH ETFs have not witnessed a single day of net outflow since Nov. 21, pushing the combined assets under management to a record high of $1.98 billion as of Dec. 12. The CryptoQuant analysts issued a $5,000 target price for ETH, driven by the renewed institutional and retail investor interest in Ether. “Based on valuation metrics, ETH could be heading above $5,000 if current demand and supply dynamics continue,” the note reads. “According to ETH’s realized price — the average price at which holders purchased their ETH — the current upper limit for ETH’s price stands around $5.2k.” The analysts indicated that as new buyers buy Ether at higher prices, this upper price band will continue to increase, suggesting further upward potential in the current bull cycle. Growing Onchain Activity CryptoQuant also highlighted that the blockchain saw increased activity, with total daily transactions now at 6.5 and 7.5 million for most of the year. The figure hovered at roughly 5 million daily last year. “Higher network activity on Ethereum signifies increased usage and demand for the network’s capabilities, reflecting growing adoption of decentralized applications,” it stated. Developers use the Ethereum network to create decentralized applications (DApps), such as decentralized crypto exchanges, where users can trade meme coins or transact with stablecoins. This heightened activity has pushed network fees higher, leading to Ether being burned under the network’s fee-burning mechanism. “The pace of supply growth has slowed in recent months as the amount of Ethereum burned via fees has increased since September, exerting deflationary pressure on the digital asset,” CryptoQuant explained. Ether is now changing hands for $3,929 per coin, according to CoinGecko. Over the past 30 days, it’s up about 22% and recently topped the $4,000 mark for the first time since March.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,ZyCrypto,https://zycrypto.com/ethereum-price-on-course-to-clinch-5000-due-to-these-two-extremely-bullish-catalysts/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png

Backed by Metalpha, Waterdrip Capital, BIT Mining, Animoca Brands, and more, Prosper has procured the new ASIC miners from BITMAIN to bring institutional-grade execution quality to its protocol Prosper aims to expand its underlying Bitcoin hashrate capacity to accelerate the flywheel of DAO-owned hashrate and Bitcoin treasury operations & democratise access to institutional-grade mining Following the announcement of Prosper’s long-term partnership and hosting service agreement with BITMAIN, the world’s leading manufacturer of digital currency mining servers, this landmark purchase marks an instrumental step in Prosper’s mission to provide institutional-grade reliability to its mining ecosystem. By leveraging BITMAIN’s cutting-edge products, Prosper enhances the value delivered to its $PROS token holders, further distinguishing itself as the premier Web3 Bitcoin mining protocol backed by leading industry players. “Bitcoin brought about a fundamental shift in finance by democratizing an economic system in its entirety with blockchain technology. Prosper follows the footsteps of Bitcoin’s core ethos by democratizing access to Bitcoin hashrate, the underlying layer powering Bitcoin-through blockchain technology. This layer of community governance and ownership afforded by blockchain allows Prosper to scale its flywheel of both Bitcoin hashrate and treasury operations while simultaneously helping to ensure that Bitcoin mining layer is sufficiently decentralized to maintain Bitcoin’s status as the most recognized digital reserve currency. ” said Milton Lam, Prosper Advisory Council Member.

Earlier in October, Animoca Brands also disclosed its intention to purchase $PROS tokens from the open market. These investments demonstrate the strong confidence in Prosper’s vision of bridging institutional-grade Bitcoin mining power on-chain and its innovative approach to Bitcoin liquidity farming. The involvement of these strategic partners brings crucial industry expertise and networks to support Prosper’s operations as it scales. Positioning Prosper for Growth Prosper’s tokenomics adopts a unique design to ensure hashrate-per-token will only increase and be accretive to $PROS holders. Prosper’s DAO leverages a unique flywheel model with both hashrate and Bitcoin treasury operations – all governed by and for the benefits of $PROS holders. Institutional-grade hashrate generates Bitcoin on an ongoing basis, part of which is rewarded to holders for their active participation, and remaining goes to the DAO treasury. DAO’s treasury Bitcoin can be directed towards TVL opportunities with ecosystem partners such as Bitcoin L2 to generate benefits for $PROS holders and the DAO. Growth in DAO treasury value and $PROS adoption allows the protocol to further expand underlying hashrate and enhance protocol resilience. By combining institutional-grade Bitcoin mining hashrate, a decentralized protocol design backed by strong fundamentals, and an extensive network of strategic partners, Prosper is well-positioned to solidify its status as the flagship decentralized Bitcoin mining protocol.

They have accumulated 210 million Dogecoin (DOGE) tokens as they eye a potential rally to $0.5. These whales have also shown interest in an AI coin called Intel Markets (INTL) . Intel Markets has dominated this bull market, increasing by more than 600% while raising over $4.1 million in funding. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) could soar to $6. An analyst believes the altcoin is following its 2021 price movement. Whales go on buying spree, DOGE ready for next leg up Despite the ongoing consolidation, Dogecoin whales are not backing out. They have bought over 210 million DOGE during this period, per Ali Charts. According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin crypto is trading between $0.3696 and $0.4758 on the weekly level. DOGE has dipped by 4.8% in the past week. Nevertheless, analysts believe a rally could occur soon. Crypto Genos forecasts the value of the Dogecoin token could rally to $0.5 in the coming weeks. Another analyst called Cantonese Cat told their followers the memecoin is ready for the next move up. The analyst posted a chart comparing the Dogecoin price movement this year to that of 2021. If this pattern plays out, the value of DOGE could pump to $3.5 soon and $22.5 in the long run. However, the Hull Moving Average (9) and VWMA (10) are showing sell signs which is a bearish signal. You might also like: Dogecoin attracts investors as experts think Intel Markets could give 10x returns Intel Markets AI trading bot sets it apart from the competition Intel Markets is a project that seeks to change the trading market through the use of AI trading bots.

Cardano forecasted to reach $6 based on previous cycle Cantonese Cat predicts the value of the Cardano token could rise to $6-$8 in the next few weeks. The analyst believes the DeFi coin is following the same pattern from 2021. At the time, Cardano was trading around $0.4 before it rallied to the $3 region. Another analyst called Sssebi posted a similar prediction. According to him, there are some similarities between the Cardano price movement in 2021 and 2024. The analyst noted the bull season is on the way. At the moment, the altcoin is showing mixed sentiment on the price chart. CoinMarketCap data shows its value has dropped by 2.6% in the weekly timeframe. However, the Cardano crypto is bullish on the biweekly and monthly charts with price increases of 15.7% and 96.7%, respectively. Its 14-day RSI is above the midline, hinting at a potential rally. In Conclusion Investors who want big gains in the coming months should consider Dogecoin, Intel Markets, and Cardano. Analysts forecast their prices could skyrocket to new levels in the coming months. Intel Markets is already up 600%, outshining most altcoins in the market.

Historically, such patterns – where large wallets accumulate coins from impatient or panicked retail traders – often signal future growth. However, the success of Chainlink and other large-cap altcoins still hinges on Bitcoin’s ability to maintain its momentum, the on-chain crypto analytic platform said in its findings . If Bitcoin continues to hold steady, there are strong indications that patient holders of LINK will see long-term rewards. The recent surge in the price can also be attributed, in part, to World Liberty Financial’s $1 million purchase of LINK, increasing its holdings to $2 million. Backed by the Trump family, the platform also holds significant amounts of Aave’s AAVE , with LINK now being its fourth-largest holding after Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT). World Liberty Financial uses Chainlink’s services for essential pricing data and cross-chain interoperability. LINK Futures OI Reaches All-Time High This surge in value also coincided with a notable increase in Futures Open Interest (OI). According to Glassnode, this figure has hit an all-time high of $770.27 million, signaling a massive uptick in trading activity. There’s also been a significant profit-taking in the spot market, with $35.57 million in realized profits, making it the second-largest profit-taking event of the year, behind only February 11’s $40.39 million. This activity was predominantly driven by speculative market participants, with 15.3% of profits taken by ultra-short-term holders (1d-1w) and 22.5% by short-term holders (3-6m). Despite the profit-taking, LINK’s fundamentals are showing positive signs, with active addresses trending higher, signaling continued interest and potential for future growth, though still below the 2021 peak.

37590060,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105040,1734098620,Market Expert Says Dogecoin Is Ready for Its Next Move to $24,"Seasoned market analyst Cantonese Cat has suggested that Dogecoin is ready for its next bullish outburst, speculating an ambitious surge to $24 per coin. Despite a broader crypto market bullish momentum, Dogecoin has not yet replicated its early November success. For context, Dogecoin surged 132% in three weeks last month, hitting a three-year price high of $0.4800, spurred by a fever pitch demand.Although the asset retested the multi-year resistance last week, it has retraced 16% from there to the current market price. However, Dogecoin bulls remain unperturbed, insisting that the meme coin will replicate Bitcoin’s bullish uptrend and see higher prices.Dogecoin Ready for the Next Move, Analyst InsistsPseudonymous analyst Cantonese Cat is among the market commentators speculating on higher prices for the meme coin alpha. In a Thursday tweet , he suggested that Dogecoin’s next move is imminent.The market expert shares a Dogecoin 1W chart to back his assertions, pointing to the meme coin's rejection of lower prices. His chart implied that the largest meme coin by market cap has held its own around the 0.786 Fibonacci extension and should move higher from the resistance region. Dogecoin to $24 Notably, Cantonese Cat emphasized that Dogecoin saw a similar price action in 2021 , where it surged from the same level. The analyst’s chart shows that the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap surged from the region to above the 2.272 Fibonacci level, peaking at $0.73995 in the cycle.As a result, he argued that Dogecoin is ready to replicate last cycle’s feat, predicting an ambitious uptrend to the same Fibonacci extension at $24. Meanwhile, a surge from the current market price to the lofty $24 price target will see Dogecoin appreciate 5,818%, with its market cap surpassing $3.5 trillion.Whale Accumulation Reestablishes Bullish SentimentsInterestingly, whale activities on the Dogecoin ecosystem suggest that market participants expect higher prices. Data shows a recent accumulation trend among large DOGE holders looking to leverage the dip and buy at a discount.Market analyst Ali Martinez pointed to this accumulation trend, reestablishing positive sentiments in the Dogecoin community. The analyst shared a chart showing that whales holding between 10 million and 100 million DOGE bought 160 million of the meme coin ($64 million) in the past 24 hours. DOGE Whales The latest accumulation takes the holdings of whales of that caliber to 22 billion DOGE ($9 billion). Notably, an asset accumulation in this manner discloses positive market sentiments among whales and usually precedes a strong bullish outburst.In the meantime, Dogecoin trades at $0.4038, down 3.37% in the past 24 hours.",POSITIVE,DOGE,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/13/market-expert-says-dogecoin-is-ready-for-its-next-move-to-24/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=market-expert-says-dogecoin-is-ready-for-its-next-move-to-24,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

In a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter), Alipay dismissed the claims as “groundless” and humorously referenced a viral banana ad featuring Tron founder Justin Sun , cautioning users against drawing unfounded conclusions. The Allegations and Alipay’s Response Rumors surfaced on social media suggesting that Alipay’s platform was being used for cryptocurrency transactions, fueling speculation about the company’s stance on digital assets. Alipay’s Official Statement Alipay labeled the rumors as “fake news” and reiterated its adherence to existing regulations. The company clarified that its platform does not support cryptocurrency purchases, emphasizing its commitment to legal and compliant operations. In a lighthearted remark, Alipay stated: “Just because you saw a banana ad on X, it doesn’t mean you can buy bananas on X!” Alipay’s Stance on Cryptocurrencies Alipay has consistently maintained a cautious approach toward cryptocurrencies, in line with China’s stringent regulatory framework. Key Policies Prohibition on Crypto Transactions : Alipay prohibits the use of its platform for cryptocurrency-related activities, including trading and purchases. Regulatory Compliance : The payment giant operates under the oversight of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) , which has banned cryptocurrency transactions to prevent financial risks. Anti-Fraud Measures : Alipay actively monitors and flags suspicious activities to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) laws. The Role of Social Media in Spreading Rumors The rapid spread of false information highlights the challenges companies face in the digital age. Justin Sun’s Banana Ad The viral ad featuring Tron’s Justin Sun humorously eating a banana inadvertently fueled speculation. Social media users drew baseless connections between the ad and Alipay’s alleged involvement in cryptocurrency transactions. Alipay’s Proactive Response By swiftly addressing the rumors, Alipay reinforced its commitment to transparency and regulatory adherence while dispelling misinformation. Cryptocurrency Regulations in China Alipay’s strict stance reflects China’s broader regulatory environment, which has taken a hard line on cryptocurrency activities: 1. Ban on Crypto Trading and Mining The Chinese government has outlawed cryptocurrency trading and mining to prevent financial instability. 2. Promotion of the Digital Yuan China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC), the digital yuan , has been heavily promoted as an alternative to decentralized cryptocurrencies. 3. Impact on Businesses Companies operating in China must comply with these regulations, avoiding any association with banned crypto activities. Industry Reactions The denial by Alipay underscores a broader industry trend of navigating misinformation and aligning with regulations: Reaffirming Compliance : Companies like Alipay are doubling down on transparency to maintain user trust. Managing Perceptions : False rumors can impact brand reputation, prompting swift responses from businesses. Balancing Innovation and Compliance : Firms in fintech and payments are exploring blockchain technologies while staying within regulatory boundaries. Conclusion Alipay’s firm denial of cryptocurrency purchase rumors highlights its commitment to compliance and its proactive approach to managing misinformation. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, companies like Alipay must balance innovation with strict adherence to regulatory frameworks.

Top crypto investments yielded massive returns this year, and market outlook suggests 2025 could be better. 1Fuel is among the tokens tipped to explode in 2025. The new token’s presale has been excellent so far, and it may go on to do 50x soon. Dogecoin and VeChain are other altcoins experts say could impress. We look into their potential and that of 1Fuel below. 1Fuel edges closer to 50x rally as the next presale stage commences The 1Fuel presale has completed its 50 million token allocation in stage one. The presale has progressed to the next stage, with 1Fuel token’s value increasing from $0.01 to $0.012. This means early investors have bought over 50 million 1Fuel tokens at the lowest price possible and are expected to enjoy a higher profit margin. Even though 1Fuel remains equally as profitable in its new stage, every delay takes away early entry advantages like purchase bonuses and better returns. Willing investors must act swiftly before 1Fuel sells out stage 2 of its presale. 1Fuel has been tipped for huge returns, and every smart investor wants to be a beneficiary of that. Hence, investors are snapping up the presale token at an incredible rate. 1Fuel is seen as one of the best crypto buys ahead of 2025, and pundits believe taking a chance on it would be worthwhile. The 1Fuel token isn’t just riding a wave of buzz—it’s carving out a lasting legacy in the crypto world. Unlike many fleeting trends, 1Fuel’s unmatched utilities and groundbreaking innovation are poised to make it a cornerstone of the top crypto investments this year and beyond. 1Fuel has tangible utilities that are of much importance in the crypto space. These utilities will help 1Fuel maintain its value and longevity. 1Fuel is on hand to do 50x in 2025, and experts see it as the first of many to come. Dogecoin price outlook: What to expect from DOGE in 2025 Dogecoin is high on the list of cryptocurrencies likely to hit new all-time highs in Q1 2025. The meme coin has found its momentum and is on a bullish stride that could take it beyond $0.73, currently at an all-time high. Dogecoin trades around $0.40 – $0.45 currently, after reversing the loss that took it below the price zone. Dogecoin is keen to beat the resistance at $0.50, but bear actions around this point seem too strong. Experts say if the bull eventually takes control, Dogecoin is expected to cross $0.50 and attempt a new peak price. The sentiment around Dogecoin is great currently, so this may happen in the coming days and continue in 2025. The projection is for Dogecoin to hit $1 by Q2 or before, and that’s looking increasingly possible. VeChain to resume surge to $0.1 and above VeChain is heading closer to the $0.1 milestone. The altcoin pumped massively in the past month, moving from $0.02 to $0.079, a yearly high. However, VeChain failed to defend the peak price, falling by over 12% in the last seven days. On the chart, data suggests that VeChain has now found its momentum again. VeChain has moved beyond its $0.05 dipped price to $0.06. It is expected to test the $0.80 resistance again and eventually surge towards $0.1 as the bears gradually lose control. VeChain could reach the $0.1 milestone by January 2025, as experts predict a prolonged upward surge. VeChain will likely settle around $0.2 in Q2 2025 before possibly setting a new all-time high around this time. Conclusion Dogecoin to $1 and VeChain to $0.1 is looking like a possibility.

37587896,https://coinpaper.com/6537/australian-pension-giant-amp-invests-27-million-in-bitcoin,1734098366,Australian Pension Giant AMP Invests $27 Million in Bitcoin,"AMP, one of Australia’s largest superannuation funds, has taken a cautious step into the digital asset space with a $27 million Bitcoin investment, marking a first for the Australian pension industry. Meanwhile, in China, Alipay, the country’s leading payment platform, has drawn attention by featuring advertisements promoting Bitcoin ETFs, signaling a subtle yet intriguing shift in a market known for its strict anti-crypto stance. AMP’s $27 Million Bitcoin Investment Marks a Turning Point for Australian Superannuation Funds AMP, one of Australia's leading superannuation funds, has become the first major fund in the country to invest in Bitcoin (BTC). With a $27 million allocation to the digital asset in May 2024, AMP has joined the global trend of institutional investors exploring Bitcoin as a portfolio diversifier. The $27 million investment represents a modest 0.05% of AMP’s total $57 billion in assets under management (AUM). According to Financial Review , the fund acquired Bitcoin during its price range of $60,000 to $70,000, positioning itself to benefit from the cryptocurrency’s upward trajectory. AMP's move comes amid Bitcoin’s historic price rally, fueled by a surge in market sentiment following Donald Trump’s electoral victory in November 2024. Bitcoin recently breached the $100,000 milestone, signaling unprecedented confidence among market participants. Despite this bold move, other Australian superannuation funds remain hesitant to follow suit, citing the nascent asset class's volatility and regulatory uncertainty as primary concerns. AMP’s investment aligns with a broader global trend of pension funds integrating Bitcoin into their portfolios to capitalize on its growth potential and hedging properties. Institutional interest in Bitcoin has surged in recent years, with pension funds worldwide seeking to diversify holdings and enhance returns amid persistently low yields in traditional assets. In July 2024, Michigan’s state pension fund disclosed a $6.6-million exposure to Bitcoin through ARK 21Shares’ Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). This marked one of the first instances of a US state pension fund actively participating in the Bitcoin market. South Korea’s National Pension Service (NPS), the world’s third-largest public pension fund, followed in August with the acquisition of 24,500 MicroStrategy shares. Market participants view investments in MicroStrategy as a leveraged Bitcoin play due to the company’s significant Bitcoin holdings, financed through convertible notes and equity offerings. The trend has continued to gain momentum across regions. In October, Florida’s Chief Financial Officer, Jimmy Patronis, advocated for the state’s public pension funds to explore Bitcoin investments. More recently, United Kingdom-based pension manager Cartwright announced a 3% allocation to Bitcoin in November. Sam Roberts, Cartwright’s director of investment consulting, lauded Bitcoin’s “unique asymmetric risk-return profile” as a compelling reason for the allocation. Roberts expressed optimism that the move would inspire other institutional investors in the UK to diversify into Bitcoin, setting a precedent for broader adoption. AMP’s decision to invest in Bitcoin suggests a willingness to embrace innovative asset classes while maintaining a conservative allocation. By integrating Bitcoin into its portfolio, the fund aims to benefit from the cryptocurrency's status as a hedge against inflation and its potential for outsized returns. The timing of the investment also demonstrates AMP’s strategic foresight. Bitcoin’s continued appreciation and the global recognition of its role in a diversified portfolio have positioned AMP as a trailblazer among Australian superannuation funds. Skepticism Persists in Australia Despite AMP’s bold move, the Australian superannuation industry remains largely cautious toward Bitcoin. Many funds view the asset as too volatile and speculative to fit within their long-term investment strategies. This skepticism is a stark contrast to the growing interest seen in regions like the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, where pension funds are beginning to embrace Bitcoin as a legitimate investment option. AMP’s groundbreaking $27 million investment in Bitcoin marks a significant milestone for institutional adoption in Australia. While other superannuation funds may be hesitant to follow, AMP’s move could set the stage for a broader shift in the investment strategies of Australian pension funds. As Bitcoin continues to break records and solidify its role as a key asset in institutional portfolios, AMP’s foray into the cryptocurrency market could prove to be a transformative moment for the superannuation industry. Whether this sparks a trend among other funds remains to be seen, but the potential for Bitcoin to reshape institutional investing is undeniable. Alipay’s Bitcoin ETF Ads Stir Crypto Buzz in Mainland China Amid Strict Regulations Alipay, China’s largest payment platform with over 1 billion users, has caused a stir in the crypto community after reportedly featuring advertisements related to Bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on its platform. According to reports from Sina Finance, mainland Chinese users recently saw promotional ads for spot Bitcoin ETFs on their Alipay homepages, marking a notable development in the country’s otherwise stringent approach to digital assets. The advertisements reportedly promoted cryptocurrency investments with messages such as: “Global investment, cryptocurrency soaring, 10 yuan minimum investment, get on board now.” The ads directed users to Huabao Overseas Technology C (QDII-FOF-LOF), a fund that reportedly offers indirect exposure to Coinbase stock and the ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF. While these ads signal an unexpected softening toward crypto-related services, they come with notable restrictions. Mainland China users are currently limited to purchasing a maximum of 1,000 Chinese yuan ($137) worth of the fund’s shares daily, with a minimum investment threshold of 10 yuan ($1.40). Prominent market observer Colin Wu noted on X that Huabao Technology and other similar funds advertising cryptocurrency are leveraging the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) structure. This regulatory framework allows Chinese investors to access overseas investments indirectly. Crypto Ads Raise Eyebrows The first reports of crypto-related ads on Alipay emerged on Dec. 11, sparking widespread discussion in the Chinese blockchain community. Some users speculated that this could be a precursor to enabling direct Bitcoin purchases through Alipay, a move that would represent a seismic shift in China’s crypto policy. However, the appearance of these ads may not signal an official endorsement from Alipay’s parent company, Ant Financial Services Group. Yifan He, CEO of Chinese blockchain firm Red Date Technology, suggested that the ads might have been published by third parties exploiting regulatory loopholes. “It doesn’t mean anything. They will disappear soon,” He stated, downplaying the significance of the ads. China has long maintained a strict anti-crypto stance, with Alipay itself banning all Bitcoin-related transactions in 2019. This ban aligned with the Chinese government’s broader crackdown on cryptocurrencies, which began with the prohibition of crypto exchanges in 2017 and escalated with an interdepartmental clampdown in 2021. Despite these measures, Chinese authorities have repeatedly emphasized that crypto assets are considered legal property protected under law. The crypto ads on Alipay have reignited speculation about a potential policy shift in China. Earlier this year, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz fueled rumors that China might lift its crypto ban amid the ongoing 2024 bull market. However, skepticism remains high, as the Chinese government has shown no official signs of reversing its restrictive crypto policies. Bloomberg analyst Jack Wang noted in April that Hong Kong’s crypto ETFs remain unavailable to mainland Chinese investors, reinforcing the divide between the two jurisdictions. Nevertheless, smaller developments, such as Nano Labs—a Hangzhou-based crypto mining-chip designer—accepting Bitcoin as payment via Coinbase, suggest a nuanced shift in attitudes toward digital assets. The appearance of Bitcoin ETF ads on Alipay is a significant moment for the global crypto industry, highlighting both the growing demand for digital assets and the creative strategies used to navigate restrictive regulatory environments. While these ads may not reflect an official policy change, they demonstrate the potential for cryptocurrency-related services to gain traction in markets traditionally hostile to digital assets.",POSITIVE,BTC,ASIA | BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6537/australian-pension-giant-amp-invests-27-million-in-bitcoin,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

This milestone signals a significant shift in investor sentiment, with digital assets like Bitcoin gaining momentum over traditional safe-haven assets such as gold. A Changing Landscape for Asset Allocation Ju shared the insights on X , highlighting the growing appeal of Bitcoin among savvy investors. Despite gold’s massive $17 trillion market capitalization compared to Bitcoin’s $2 trillion , the rising AUM for BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF underscores a changing perspective on wealth preservation and growth. Bitcoin vs. Gold: A New Frontier Gold’s Legacy : Long considered a reliable store of value, gold has maintained its dominance for centuries. Bitcoin’s Appeal : As a digital alternative, Bitcoin offers decentralization, scarcity, and the potential for exponential returns. Ju emphasized that investing in Bitcoin over gold represents a forward-looking decision , aligning with technological advancements and evolving market dynamics. Key Factors Driving Bitcoin’s Momentum Several elements contribute to Bitcoin’s increasing popularity as an investment asset: 1. Institutional Adoption BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF reflects growing acceptance of digital assets among institutional investors. A regulated ETF provides traditional investors with a secure and familiar way to gain Bitcoin exposure. 2. Superior Performance Bitcoin’s price performance has outpaced gold over the past decade, offering significantly higher returns. With Bitcoin’s limited supply and increasing demand, its long-term growth potential remains strong. 3. Digital Transformation The global shift toward digital finance has boosted Bitcoin’s relevance. Investors see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation in an increasingly digital economy. Implications of the Shift The overtaking of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin counterpart carries profound implications: 1. Investor Preferences The shift indicates a growing willingness among investors to diversify into digital assets. Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a complement, if not a replacement, for traditional safe-haven assets. 2. Competitive Market Dynamics Gold remains a significant asset, but Bitcoin’s rise introduces competition for capital allocation. The debate between gold and Bitcoin reflects broader shifts in market behavior and generational preferences. 3. Market Confidence in Bitcoin ETFs The success of Bitcoin ETFs like BlackRock’s could encourage further product innovation and adoption. It highlights the maturity of the cryptocurrency market as a viable investment space. Looking Ahead: The Case for Bitcoin Ju’s remarks underline the growing momentum behind Bitcoin and its potential to redefine traditional asset classes: Market Expansion : As institutional interest grows, Bitcoin’s market cap could narrow the gap with gold. Technological Relevance : Bitcoin’s role as the foundation of the digital asset ecosystem makes it uniquely positioned for future growth. Strategic Asset Allocation : For investors, incorporating Bitcoin represents a hedge against economic uncertainty and a bet on innovation. Conclusion The surpassing of BlackRock’s gold ETF by its Bitcoin ETF is a pivotal moment in the financial markets. It signifies not just Bitcoin’s rising prominence but also a broader shift in investor sentiment toward digital assets. As Bitcoin continues to gain traction, its potential to challenge traditional safe-haven assets like gold becomes increasingly evident. For forward-looking investors, Bitcoin offers a compelling case as the asset of the future.

37587888,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109561,1734098310,Australia Proposes Stricter Crypto Oversight to Combat Financial Crime,"Australia Proposes Stricter Crypto Oversight to Combat Financial Crime As cryptocurrencies gain global traction, Australia has taken a bold step toward regulating the digital asset ecosystem. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) recently unveiled draft rules aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures for high-risk sectors, including cryptocurrency. This initiative comes at a pivotal time, with the crypto market booming and concerns about illicit activities on the rise. The draft rules focus on stricter customer verification, enhanced transaction reporting, and adherence to international compliance standards like the travel rule . Public consultation on these proposals is open until February 14, 2025 , allowing industry stakeholders to weigh in on the future of crypto regulation in Australia. Why Stricter Crypto Regulations Are Necessary Cryptocurrencies have revolutionized the financial landscape, offering faster, cheaper, and borderless transactions. However, their decentralized and pseudonymous nature also makes them attractive to bad actors. In recent years, the use of digital currencies for money laundering, fraud, and terrorism financing has raised alarms globally. In Australia, AUSTRAC’s proposed regulations aim to: Mitigate Financial Crime : Strengthen safeguards against money laundering and terrorism financing through the crypto sector. Protect Market Integrity : Build trust in Australia’s rapidly expanding digital asset market. Align with Global Standards : Ensure compliance with international frameworks such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations. Key Provisions of the Proposed Rules The draft rules outline specific measures to enhance oversight and accountability in the cryptocurrency sector. Here are the key highlights: 1. Stricter Customer Verification Requirements Businesses must implement robust know-your-customer (KYC) processes to verify the identities of individuals and entities transacting in digital currencies. Enhanced measures may include cross-referencing government-issued IDs, biometric checks, and proof of address. 2. Comprehensive Reporting Obligations Cryptocurrency exchanges and service providers will need to file detailed transaction reports with AUSTRAC. Suspicious transaction reporting will become mandatory, helping authorities identify and act against potential threats. 3. Compliance with the Travel Rule The travel rule requires cryptocurrency businesses to share customer information when transferring funds across platforms. This ensures that key details, such as the sender’s and receiver’s information, are recorded and accessible. The Global Context of Crypto Regulation Australia’s move aligns with a growing international trend toward stricter crypto oversight. United States The U.S. has introduced several legislative measures to monitor crypto transactions, focusing on AML and CTF compliance. European Union The EU has adopted the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) , setting a clear framework for digital assets while prioritizing consumer protection and market stability. FATF Standards The FATF has provided detailed guidelines on crypto compliance, urging nations to implement robust mechanisms to prevent illicit activities. Australia’s proposed regulations are in line with these international efforts, reflecting the country’s proactive stance on digital asset governance. Australia’s Growing Cryptocurrency Market Australia has emerged as a significant player in the global cryptocurrency market, with increasing adoption among individuals and institutions. Factors driving this growth include: 1. High Adoption Rates A 2024 survey revealed that nearly 20% of Australians own cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most popular choices. 2. Thriving Crypto Startups Cities like Sydney and Melbourne have become hubs for blockchain innovation, hosting startups focused on DeFi, NFT marketplaces, and tokenized assets. 3. Institutional Interest Major financial institutions in Australia are exploring crypto-related services, such as custody solutions and crypto-backed loans. With such rapid growth, the need for a robust regulatory framework has become more pressing than ever. Benefits of Stricter Oversight The proposed regulations are expected to bring several advantages for the crypto industry and its stakeholders: 1. Enhanced Security Stricter verification processes will help prevent fraud and unauthorized access. 2. Increased Trust Regulatory compliance can enhance consumer and investor confidence in the crypto sector. 3. Alignment with Global Norms By adhering to international standards, Australian crypto businesses can gain a competitive edge in the global market. 4. Better Consumer Protection Improved oversight ensures that users are safeguarded against scams and financial malpractice. Challenges Facing the Crypto Sector While the benefits are clear, implementing these regulations may pose challenges: 1. Higher Compliance Costs Crypto businesses, especially startups, may face financial strain in meeting stringent regulatory requirements. 2. Operational Complexity Enhanced reporting and verification measures could increase administrative burdens. 3. Privacy Concerns Critics argue that stricter regulations might compromise user anonymity, a core feature of cryptocurrencies. 4. Risk of Over-Regulation Overly rigid policies could stifle innovation and deter businesses from entering the market. Public Consultation: A Collaborative Approach AUSTRAC has invited feedback from industry stakeholders, ensuring that the final regulations are practical and balanced. Deadline : February 14, 2025 Key Participants : Crypto exchanges, blockchain startups, financial institutions, and consumer advocacy groups. This inclusive approach demonstrates AUSTRAC’s commitment to fostering a thriving yet secure cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Future of Cryptocurrency in Australia Australia’s proactive stance on crypto regulation could set a benchmark for other nations. By addressing financial crime risks while supporting innovation, the country can position itself as a global leader in the digital asset space. Opportunities for Growth Regulated Innovation : Clear rules encourage the development of innovative blockchain solutions. Attracting Global Talent : A secure and transparent crypto market could draw talent and investment from around the world. Conclusion Australia’s proposed regulations mark a significant step toward creating a secure and trustworthy cryptocurrency ecosystem. By targeting anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing, AUSTRAC aims to strike a balance between innovation and security. As the consultation period progresses, it will be crucial for industry stakeholders to collaborate and provide input, ensuring that the final regulations are both effective and equitable. With these measures, Australia is poised to become a leader in the global effort to integrate digital assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly.

37589399,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52058,1734098261,Tron CEO Justin Sun Calls Ripple CTO To Make Special Request,"On December 12, 2024, Justin Sun, the founder and CEO of Tron (TRX), made waves in the cryptocurrency community with a notable tweet directed at David Schwartz, the Chief Technology Officer of Ripple, who is also known on Twitter by his handle, @JoelKatz. In his tweet, Sun wrote, “RLUSD on Tron? @JoelKatz”, sparking discussions about the potential expansion of Ripple’s recently approved stablecoin, RLUSD, to the Tron blockchain. RLUSD on Tron? @JoelKatz — H.E. Justin Sun (@justinsuntron) December 11, 2024 What Does This Mean? Justin Sun’s request came when Ripple secured final regulatory approval for RLUSD from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This milestone represents a significant achievement in Ripple’s ongoing efforts to enhance its presence in the stablecoin and payments sectors. Currently, RLUSD is confirmed to launch exclusively on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, two of the most prominent blockchain platforms. Sun’s outreach highlights his interest in making Tron a key player in RLUSD adoption . By inviting Schwartz to bring RLUSD to the Tron ecosystem, Sun is positioning Tron as a competitive and versatile blockchain network capable of supporting Ripple’s stablecoin. Strategic Implications Ripple’s decision to launch RLUSD on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum demonstrates a focus on leveraging networks with established ecosystems and robust infrastructure. Ethereum, as a leading smart contract platform, offers extensive DeFi integrations, while the XRP Ledger is optimized for efficient cross-border payments. Sun’s proposal could be seen as an attempt to diversify RLUSD’s accessibility by incorporating Tron, a network known for its scalability, low transaction fees, and high throughput. Tron has already established itself as a leading blockchain for decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, and stablecoins, hosting major projects like USDT and USDC. Adding RLUSD to Tron could expand the stablecoin’s user base and increase its utility within DeFi and payment systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Motivations Sun’s invitation might also reflect an ambition to align Tron with high-profile blockchain initiatives, leveraging Ripple’s regulatory approval as a trust and compliance signal. Why did Sun make this move? He’s seemingly seeking to establish Tron as an attractive alternative or complementary platform for stablecoin issuance and adoption. Moreover, Ripple’s recent regulatory win sets a precedent for the acceptance of stablecoins by U.S. regulators, a development that could shape the broader cryptocurrency landscape. Tron’s proactive approach aligns with its ongoing efforts to remain competitive in a rapidly evolving market. Challenges and Prospects While Sun’s outreach reflects strategic intent, several challenges must be considered. Extending RLUSD to the Tron network would require assessing the technical, regulatory, and market implications. Compatibility with Tron’s infrastructure and alignment with Ripple’s business objectives would be critical factors. From Ripple’s perspective, adding a third blockchain to support RLUSD may not be a priority, particularly given its focus on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum. However, if Tron can demonstrate tangible benefits such as faster adoption or reduced operational costs, Ripple might consider Sun’s proposal.

The firm, which manages assets worth $56 billion , is among the first in Australia to include Bitcoin in its portfolio for retirement savings. This development, reported by Financial Review , highlights a growing trend of institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies despite skepticism from other major Australian funds. AMP’s Bold Move into Bitcoin AMP’s decision to allocate part of its retirement fund to Bitcoin reflects a strategic shift toward diversifying its investment portfolio. Amount Invested : $27 million Purpose : Diversification and potential long-term growth Context : AMP’s move is part of a broader global trend where financial institutions increasingly view Bitcoin as a viable asset class. This investment signifies confidence in Bitcoin’s ability to act as a hedge against inflation and an opportunity for high returns in the evolving financial landscape. Australia’s Cautious Crypto Landscape While AMP’s foray into Bitcoin is noteworthy, it contrasts sharply with the stance of other major Australian funds, many of which remain reluctant to invest in cryptocurrencies. Why Are Other Funds Hesitant? Volatility Concerns : Bitcoin’s price fluctuations make it a risky asset for retirement funds, which typically prioritize stability. Regulatory Uncertainty : Lack of clear cryptocurrency regulations in Australia adds an element of risk for institutional investors. Conservative Investment Strategies : Many funds adhere to traditional investment models, avoiding emerging asset classes like crypto. The Case for Bitcoin in Retirement Funds AMP’s investment aligns with a growing recognition of Bitcoin’s potential as a strategic asset. Key Benefits of Bitcoin Investment Inflation Hedge : Bitcoin’s fixed supply of 21 million coins makes it a hedge against inflation, much like gold. Diversification : Adding Bitcoin to a retirement portfolio can reduce risk by diversifying across asset classes. High Growth Potential : Bitcoin has historically delivered outsized returns compared to traditional assets. AMP’s Long-Term Vision By investing in Bitcoin, AMP demonstrates a forward-thinking approach to retirement fund management. The firm acknowledges Bitcoin’s volatility but emphasizes its long-term growth potential. Bitcoin and the Global Pension Industry AMP’s investment echoes similar moves in the global financial sector: United States : Fidelity Investments offers Bitcoin exposure for retirement accounts through its Digital Assets platform. Europe : Pension funds in Switzerland and the Netherlands have begun exploring crypto investments. These developments highlight a gradual shift in how institutional investors perceive cryptocurrencies as part of a diversified portfolio. Challenges and Risks Despite its potential, investing in Bitcoin through retirement funds carries challenges: Market Volatility : Bitcoin’s price swings could lead to significant short-term losses. Regulatory Hurdles : Ongoing changes in crypto regulations may affect institutional adoption. Liquidity Concerns : Converting Bitcoin to cash can be more complex than traditional assets. AMP’s move also raises questions about the fiduciary responsibilities of retirement fund managers, especially in a market as unpredictable as cryptocurrency. How Does AMP’s Investment Compare Globally? AMP’s $27M Bitcoin allocation is part of a broader trend of institutional adoption. Global Context : While AMP is a pioneer in Australia, firms like Tesla, MicroStrategy, and Square have already integrated Bitcoin into their financial strategies. Emerging Trend : Pension funds globally are starting to view Bitcoin as an alternative investment, driven by its resilience and growing acceptance. Conclusion AMP’s decision to invest $27 million in Bitcoin for its retirement fund is a bold step that sets it apart from other major Australian funds. While the move reflects confidence in Bitcoin’s potential, it also underscores the challenges of navigating a volatile and emerging asset class. As institutional interest in cryptocurrency grows globally, AMP’s investment may encourage other Australian funds to reconsider their stance. For now, AMP’s pioneering approach positions it as a forward-thinking leader in Australia’s financial landscape.

Yet, as the industry matures, there’s an increasing demand for tokens with real utility and innovative technology. Enter Lightchain AI ($LCAI) , a groundbreaking project combining artificial intelligence with blockchain to deliver real-world solutions. Don’t miss out on the Lightchain AI Presale , offering an early opportunity to join this next-gen crypto movement. While meme coins thrive on speculation, projects like Lightchain AI aim to capture the same excitement while addressing practical challenges. Can it bridge the gap between hype and utility, setting a new standard for crypto innovation? Introducing the Competitors BONK: Solana’s Meme Coin Marvel BONK emerged as a playful addition to the Solana blockchain, riding the meme coin trend sparked by projects like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Designed to engage the Solana community, BONK boasts fast transaction speeds and low fees thanks to its underlying blockchain infrastructure. Its vibrant community and viral campaigns have made it a standout in the meme coin category, but its long-term potential remains tied to speculative interest rather than utility. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): The Tech-Driven Contender Lightchain AI takes a different approach, aiming to redefine blockchain’s role through the integration of artificial intelligence. Its unique features, such as Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), address challenges like scalability, transparency, and decentralized governance. With a presale raising over $1.27 million, $LCAI is already gaining traction as a forward-thinking altcoin with real-world applications in industries like healthcare, finance, and supply chain. Solana's Meme Coin BONK Surges Amid Market Rally—Is Lightchain AI Set to Join the Trend? Community and Virality: The Power of Hype BONK thrives on its meme-inspired roots, capturing attention with lighthearted marketing and a strong sense of community. Social media campaigns and influencer endorsements have amplified its visibility, driving speculative investments. However, while BONK’s virality generates short-term excitement, it faces challenges in sustaining momentum as the market shifts toward utility-focused projects. In contrast, Lightchain AI leverages its technological depth to attract a more diverse audience, including developers, enterprises, and institutional investors. While it lacks the instant appeal of a meme coin, its focus on solving real-world problems positions it for sustained growth and adoption. Key Differentiators: Hype vs. Utility Scalability and Efficiency BONK: Built on Solana, BONK benefits from the blockchain’s high-speed transactions and low fees. This makes it attractive for microtransactions and community-driven initiatives, but its utility remains limited to these functions. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): The platform’s PoI consensus mechanism and AIVM provide unmatched scalability for complex AI computations. This architecture enables Lightchain AI to handle large-scale applications efficiently, setting it apart from meme coins reliant on speculative trading. Use Cases and Industry Adoption BONK: BONK’s appeal lies in its simplicity and accessibility. While its ecosystem may include staking and NFT collaborations, it lacks the technological depth to expand into broader industries. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): With applications spanning healthcare, finance, and supply chain, Lightchain AI delivers tangible value through decentralized AI solutions. Its transparent governance model and privacy-preserving technologies make it a versatile platform for real-world challenges. Additional Insights: What Sets Lightchain AI Apart Advanced Technology Lightchain AI’s core innovations, PoI and AIVM, redefine blockchain’s potential. By incentivizing nodes to perform meaningful AI tasks, PoI ensures network security while advancing AI research. AIVM further enhances the platform by seamlessly integrating popular AI frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, creating a developer-friendly environment. Tokenomics and Sustainability BONK: Its tokenomics are designed to reward community engagement, but they rely heavily on maintaining hype to sustain value. Lightchain AI ($LCAI): With deflationary mechanisms like token burning and a focus on utility-driven demand, $LCAI ensures long-term sustainability. The token’s role in governance and accessing AI services adds intrinsic value. Market Strategy While BONK’s strategy revolves around viral marketing, Lightchain AI focuses on building partnerships with developers and enterprises. This diversified approach reduces reliance on speculative interest, providing a more stable foundation for growth. Why Lightchain AI Surpasses Meme Coins Like BONK Meme coins like BONK thrive on hype and community enthusiasm, but their limited utility makes them vulnerable to market volatility. Lightchain AI addresses this gap by combining advanced technology with practical applications, making it a strong contender for long-term success. Utility Beyond Speculation: Unlike BONK, which primarily appeals to speculative traders, Lightchain AI offers solutions for real-world challenges, attracting a broader range of investors. Transparent Governance: Lightchain AI’s decentralized decision-making process ensures accountability and inclusivity, enhancing trust and engagement. Scalability for Real-World Impact: PoI and AIVM enable Lightchain AI to handle complex computations, making it ideal for industries requiring advanced AI capabilities. The Future: Can Lightchain AI Join the Rally? Roadmap Highlights Prototype Development (November 2024): Initial testing of PoI and AIVM in controlled environments.

37587760,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109565,1734098196,"CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Bull Market Intact, Peak Yet to Come","CryptoQuant: Bitcoin Bull Market Intact, Peak Yet to Come The Bitcoin bull market is far from over, according to CryptoQuant contributor Datascope. In a recent analysis, Datascope affirmed that Bitcoin’s price trajectory remains positive, with no signs of the market reaching its peak. However, critical indicators suggest caution as prices approach potential correction zones. Key Insights from CryptoQuant’s Analysis Datascope’s insights hinge on the interplay between Bitcoin’s 30-day bull-bear market cycle moving average and its 365-day moving average : 1. Bull Market Confirmation Bitcoin continues to exhibit bullish momentum as long as the 30-day moving average (short-term) stays above the 365-day moving average (long-term) . The gap between these averages serves as a key signal for the market’s direction. 2. Stronger Bullish Signal Pending A more definitive bullish signal would emerge if the 30-day average crosses above the 365-day average , further solidifying the uptrend. 3. Potential Correction Zones While the long-term outlook remains positive, short-term corrections are possible. Investors are advised to stay cautious as prices test resistance levels. The Current State of Bitcoin’s Bull Market Positive Momentum Bitcoin’s sustained price growth underscores the strength of its current bull run. Market trends, coupled with institutional adoption and macroeconomic factors, continue to support the asset’s upward trajectory. Unreached Peak CryptoQuant’s analysis indicates that Bitcoin has not yet reached its peak, suggesting room for further growth before a significant market reversal. Bull-Bear Cycle Dynamics The relationship between short- and long-term moving averages is critical for understanding Bitcoin’s market phases. A consistent gap in favor of the 30-day average reflects sustained bullish momentum. Investor Considerations in the Current Market 1. Short-Term Volatility Investors should be prepared for price fluctuations as Bitcoin approaches resistance levels. Corrections are a natural part of bull markets and can provide buying opportunities. 2. Long-Term Outlook The long-term moving average indicates robust market health, reinforcing Bitcoin’s position as a store of value and investment asset. 3. Risk Management Set stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses. Diversify portfolios to balance exposure to Bitcoin and other assets. Factors Supporting Bitcoin’s Bull Market 1. Institutional Adoption BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF recently surpassed its gold counterpart in AUM, signaling growing institutional interest. Major corporations continue to incorporate Bitcoin into their treasury strategies. 2. Macro-Economic Environment Inflation concerns and a weakening dollar drive demand for Bitcoin as a hedge. Central banks’ exploration of digital currencies boosts the credibility of blockchain-based assets. 3. Technological Advancements Enhancements in Bitcoin infrastructure, such as Lightning Network adoption, improve scalability and usability. Potential Risks to the Bull Market 1. Regulatory Uncertainty Stricter crypto regulations in key markets could impact institutional and retail participation. 2. Market Saturation Over-leveraged positions among traders could exacerbate corrections. 3. External Shocks Macro-economic events, such as geopolitical instability or unexpected monetary policy changes, could trigger short-term volatility. Conclusion CryptoQuant’s analysis confirms that Bitcoin’s bull market remains intact, with its peak still on the horizon. The interplay between short- and long-term moving averages highlights sustained positive momentum, though investors should remain cautious as the market approaches potential correction zones. As the crypto ecosystem evolves and adoption grows, Bitcoin continues to cement its status as a leading asset in the financial landscape. For investors, understanding the nuances of bull-bear cycles and market signals can provide a significant edge in navigating this dynamic environment.

37587759,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109567,1734098131,"Bitcoin Exchange Balances Hit Seven-Year Low at 2.8M, Signaling Institutional Demand","Bitcoin Exchange Balances Hit Seven-Year Low at 2.8M, Signaling Institutional Demand Bitcoin exchange balances have plummeted to their lowest levels in seven years, with just 2.8 million BTC remaining on trading platforms, according to data from Glassnode cited by CoinDesk . The sharp decline is attributed to institutional buying , as significant outflows have occurred since the U.S. election. Institutional Buying Behind Exchange Outflows Recent Trends Outflows of Over $10 Million : High-value Bitcoin transactions are leaving exchanges at an unprecedented pace, suggesting accumulation by institutions. 200,000 BTC Withdrawn : Nearly 200,000 BTC have exited exchanges recently, with December 11 alone seeing 12,500 BTC withdrawn. Major Platforms Affected Coinbase Leads Withdrawals : Nearly half of the BTC withdrawn on Dec. 11 came from Coinbase, a favored platform among institutional investors. Why Exchange Balances Are Declining 1. Long-Term Storage The outflows indicate that investors are moving Bitcoin to cold storage or self-custodial wallets, reflecting long-term holding strategies. 2. Institutional Demand The rise of spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate adoption has fueled demand among institutions. BlackRock’s Spot ETF : Contributing to increased institutional interest and direct custody over assets. 3. Reduced Selling Pressure Lower exchange balances mean reduced availability of Bitcoin for trading, potentially reducing selling pressure and supporting higher prices. Market Implications of Reduced Exchange Balances 1. Supply Squeeze As Bitcoin exits exchanges, its circulating supply on trading platforms diminishes, potentially driving prices higher as demand outpaces supply. 2. Increased Price Volatility With fewer coins available for trading, price swings may become more pronounced, especially during periods of high demand. 3. Confidence in Long-Term Value The shift to long-term storage signals growing confidence in Bitcoin’s role as a store of value, akin to digital gold. Challenges Amid Declining Exchange Balances While the reduction in exchange balances signals strong investor sentiment, it also comes with challenges: Sustainability of $2 Trillion Market Cap : Bitcoin has struggled to maintain a $2 trillion market cap despite institutional support. Psychological Resistance at $100,000 : The asset faces significant resistance at the $100,000 price level, with recent pullbacks dampening bullish momentum. Institutional Investors Driving the Shift ETFs and Corporate Adoption The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and corporate treasuries adopting BTC are key drivers: BlackRock, Fidelity, and Others : Major firms are buying Bitcoin directly, reducing reliance on exchanges. Tesla’s Holdings : Corporate examples like Tesla underline the trend of holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. Macro-Economic Drivers Inflation Hedge : Bitcoin’s limited supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation. Decentralization Appeal : Institutions value Bitcoin’s decentralized nature in uncertain economic times. What This Means for Retail Investors For retail investors, declining exchange balances suggest: Limited Opportunities to Buy : Reduced supply may make it harder to acquire Bitcoin at current levels. Potential for Price Surges : Supply constraints could lead to higher prices, benefiting early adopters. Need for Strategic Holding : Investors should consider long-term storage solutions to secure their holdings. Conclusion The decline in Bitcoin exchange balances to a seven-year low of 2.8 million BTC underscores the growing influence of institutional demand on the cryptocurrency market. While this trend signals confidence in Bitcoin’s future, it also highlights challenges in sustaining key market milestones like the $2 trillion market cap and $100,000 price level . As Bitcoin continues to evolve as a store of value and a hedge against economic uncertainty, its diminishing supply on exchanges may lead to increased volatility and opportunities for both retail and institutional investors.

37587761,https://finbold.com/?p=219188,1734098122,Opportunity: Crypto still has less than 0.1% of the developers’ population in 2024,"The developer population is expected to reach 28.7 million by the end of 2024, according to a Statista report . Crypto and blockchain developers account for less than 0.1% of this forecast, but established devs are increasing exponentially. Electric Capital ’s just-published Developer Report shows this data , evidencing how early the crypto and blockchain industry still is. According to the report, 23,613 monthly active developers exist, of which 18,511 were focused on a single blockchain. Notably, the current population of crypto developers has grown by 3% in the last three years. Yet, it has dropped 7% year over year since 2023 and saw a 23% drop since 2022’s bear market start. This status could suggest the crypto and blockchain industry could still be in even earlier stages than some enthusiasts imagined. If this proves to be true, the current state of the industry represents a lifetime opportunity for pioneer developers innovating. Total monthly active developers in crypto and blockchain. Source: Electric Capital United States, India, Ethereum, and Solana dominate among crypto developers in 2024 Overall, 18.8% of all blockchain developers are in the United States, followed by India with 11.7%. The United Kingdom is the third most dominant country, with only 4.3%, evidencing the relevancy of the first two countries. At the same time, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) dominate among the blockchains with more full-time and total crypto developers. Ethereum has 6,244 total devs, of which 2,181 work full-time, committing code at least 10 days per month. Meanwhile, Solana has 3,201 developers, out of which 582 work full-time. Interestingly, however, the higher growth among blockchain developers in 2024 was from what Electric Capital called “established devs.” These are developers who have worked and contributed for more than two years with open-source crypto projects. According to the report, there were 11,243 established devs in the industry by November 2024, a 27% growth year over year and a 65% growth in the past two years. Of these 11,243, 668 are working with Ethereum and 141 with Solana. However, 1,151 (10%) are developing for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stack, which includes other composable blockchains. On the other hand, Solana was the blockchain that attracted the highest number of new developers in 2024. According to the Developer Report, 7,625 new developers explored Solana at one point this year. Solana was the #1 ecosystem for new devs in 2024. Source: Electric Capital Development opportunity in crypto and blockchain As things develop, crypto’s ability to cross the chasm, reaching a broader audience, could bring more developers to the industry. Nevertheless, the significantly small share of the world’s developer population building for blockchain-related projects highlights the growth opportunity for the market in the following years. Some analysts expect 2025 to be “ the mother of all bull markets ” and “ the biggest crypto bull run ever .” Alex Becker and other experts have pointed out “utility altcoins” as the potential “ easiest and surest ” play in crypto. If these predictions become true, we could see a massive inflow of developers into the ecosystem, building utility projects and capitalizing from this lifetime opportunity.

According to sources cited by The Wall Street Journal, advisers are exploring whether a president can eliminate the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or consolidate its functions with the Treasury Department. Streamlining Federal Oversight of Banking Sector These discussions are part of broader efforts led by the newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), co-chaired by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. In interviews with potential appointees to the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the team has raised questions about streamlining federal oversight of the banking sector. Ideas include folding bank deposit insurance into the Treasury or combining the FDIC, OCC, and the Federal Reserve. However, any such drastic changes would require approval from a Republican-controlled Congress, an undertaking that is both procedurally complex and politically rare. Crypto Policy in Focus The transition team’s plans come as the FDIC prepares for a leadership change, with current Chair Martin Gruenberg set to retire on January 19, just before Trump’s inauguration. Gruenberg has faced criticism from figures like Representative Tom Emmer, who accused him of spearheading “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” an alleged initiative to sever the crypto industry’s access to banking services. The FDIC’s stance on cryptocurrency has drawn additional scrutiny from the courts. On December 12, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the FDIC to revise its heavily redacted “pause letters” sent to 23 financial institutions. These letters reportedly urged banks to halt or limit their involvement with crypto assets. The court has mandated that less redacted versions of the documents be refiled by January 3. Musk Advocates for Deregulation Elon Musk has been vocal about reducing government bureaucracy, recently taking to his X platform to criticize the abundance of “duplicative regulatory agencies.” Musk called for the abolition of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), established after the 2008 financial crisis, citing its inefficiency. The push for deregulation aligns with Trump’s promises to shrink government oversight and cut federal spending. If realized, these proposals could lead to significant shifts in the financial landscape, sparking debates over the balance between innovation and oversight. As discussions progress, the future of U.S. financial regulation hangs in the balance.

Gate.io has more than 100% reserves, with the latest reserves exceeding $10 billion. It’s business as usual.” He also announced a live address on X to dispel lingering doubts and reaffirm the platform’s commitment to transparency and security. https://t.co/Er6vXYI5iU — Gate.io (@gate_io) December 13, 2024 Gate.io’s clarification, coupled with the absence of any unusual activity on the blockchain, helped to quell fears and prevent significant market disruption. DefiLlama data indicated minimal asset movement, suggesting that most users did not panic withdraw their funds. While the exchange maintained that the withdrawals were part of routine operations or potential wallet rotations, it strongly condemned the spread of unverified information. Community Reaction and Broader Implications Posts cautioning users to withdraw their assets from Gate.io sparked concerns across the community. This has mostly had a ripple effect across the market since users have been sensitive to security breaches following high-profile hacks in recent years. Just this month, a report claimed that Japanese cryptocurrency exchange DMM Bitcoin winded down operations following a $320 million loss in Bitcoin caused by a private key hack in May. The breach compromised over 4,500 Bitcoins and left the company struggling to recover despite assurances to safeguard customer assets. The hack, one of Japan’s largest since the 2018 Coincheck breach, was linked to the North Korean cybercrime group Lazarus, known for laundering stolen funds through shady platforms. A recent report also confirmed that Radiant Capital’s $50 million hack of its decentralized finance (DeFi) platform was orchestrated by a hacker linked to these same North Korea. In response to this massive sensitivity in the market, Gate.io reinforced its commitment to security and transparency in follow-up statements.

37587687,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109569,1734098061,Bitcoin Nears $2 Trillion Market Cap Amid Institutional Buying,"Bitcoin Nears $2 Trillion Market Cap Amid Institutional Buying Bitcoin (BTC) is approaching a $2 trillion market cap , driven by institutional investors who are accelerating withdrawals from exchanges. According to data from Glassnode reported by CoinDesk , Bitcoin’s price is closing in on $100,000 , with exchange balances falling to a seven-year low of 2.8 million BTC . Institutional Activity Boosts Bitcoin’s Market Value Institutional investors have played a pivotal role in Bitcoin’s latest surge. Recent data highlights: Key Metrics 12,500 BTC Withdrawn on Dec. 11 : These transactions, worth $1.3 billion , accounted for significant outflows from exchanges, with half of them originating from Coinbase . 200,000 BTC Withdrawn Since the U.S. Election : This activity reflects sustained institutional interest in holding Bitcoin off-exchange. Impact on Exchange Balances Bitcoin exchange balances now sit at a seven-year low of 2.8 million BTC , underscoring reduced availability of the asset for trading. The $2 Trillion Milestone: What It Means A $2 trillion market cap represents a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s evolution, signaling: 1. Institutional Validation With companies like BlackRock and Fidelity embracing Bitcoin through ETFs and direct holdings, institutional trust in the asset has grown significantly. Institutional buying is a driving force behind the consistent price surge and exchange outflows. 2. Competitive Hedge Against Gold Bitcoin continues to position itself as “digital gold,” challenging gold’s $17 trillion market cap. The outflows signify a shift in how investors allocate assets for value storage. 3. Broader Market Adoption Increased adoption by institutional players reinforces Bitcoin’s role as a mainstream financial instrument. Exchange Outflows: A Game Changer for Bitcoin Supply Decreasing Supply on Exchanges The sustained withdrawals highlight a growing trend of long-term holding , with investors moving their BTC to: Cold Storage Wallets : Enhancing security and signaling confidence in long-term price appreciation. Custodial Services : Institutions often use specialized services for safe storage of assets. Supply Squeeze Dynamics The reduction in available supply on exchanges could lead to price surges as demand outpaces availability. A smaller tradable supply amplifies market reactions to changes in buying pressure. Challenges to Sustaining the $2 Trillion Market Cap While Bitcoin’s trajectory remains bullish, maintaining its momentum faces potential hurdles: 1. Resistance at $100,000 Psychological resistance at this milestone could trigger profit-taking, leading to short-term corrections. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Stricter crypto regulations in key markets, including the U.S. and Europe, may introduce additional challenges. 3. Volatility Concerns While institutional interest reduces speculative volatility, Bitcoin’s price swings remain a concern for risk-averse investors. What’s Driving Institutional Demand? Several factors contribute to the increasing interest from institutional investors: 1. Inflation Hedge Bitcoin’s fixed supply makes it an attractive hedge against inflation, particularly in the current macroeconomic climate. 2. Mainstream Financial Products Spot Bitcoin ETFs and custodial services have made it easier for institutions to enter the crypto market. 3. Decentralization and Security Bitcoin’s decentralized network offers a unique value proposition in an era of financial uncertainty. The Bigger Picture: Bitcoin’s Role in Global Finance Bitcoin’s journey toward a $2 trillion market cap is not just a milestone for the cryptocurrency itself but also a reflection of the broader transformation in global finance. 1. Decentralized Economy Bitcoin is at the forefront of a decentralized financial system, offering alternatives to traditional monetary policies. 2. Institutional Legitimacy The involvement of major players like BlackRock , Tesla , and Fidelity validates Bitcoin’s potential as a reserve asset. 3. Inspiration for Other Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin’s success paves the way for broader adoption of blockchain-based assets, from Ethereum to newer innovations in DeFi and Web3. Conclusion Bitcoin’s march toward a $2 trillion market cap underscores its growing acceptance as a mainstream financial asset. Institutional buying, reflected in significant outflows from exchanges and declining balances, highlights confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value. As Bitcoin nears the $100,000 milestone , the market remains optimistic about its potential to disrupt traditional finance. However, investors should remain cautious, given potential regulatory and market resistance challenges.

According to Danylo Hetmantsev , head of the Parliamentary Finance Committee , the legislation will regulate the cryptocurrency market, impose taxes on crypto profits akin to securities, and avoid tax exemptions to curb potential tax evasion. This ambitious move positions Ukraine as a progressive force in cryptocurrency regulation, balancing innovation and fiscal responsibility. Key Elements of the Draft Legislation Ukraine’s forthcoming crypto law is being developed in collaboration with the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) . 1. Legalization of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies will gain legal recognition as a legitimate asset class.

Tax exemptions will be excluded to prevent misuse and ensure fair taxation. A transparent tax structure will be implemented, simplifying compliance for traders and businesses. 3. Regulatory Oversight The National Bank of Ukraine and relevant government agencies will oversee crypto operations. Comprehensive measures will be introduced to prevent money laundering and financial crime. Ukraine’s Journey Toward Cryptocurrency Legalization Ukraine’s decision to legalize cryptocurrency reflects years of growing interest and activity in the crypto space. Crypto Activity in Ukraine Ukraine consistently ranks high in global crypto adoption indices , with a vibrant community of crypto users, developers, and miners. The country has become a hub for blockchain innovation, attracting startups and international investments.

Economic Growth Legalizing crypto could boost Ukraine’s economy by attracting foreign investments and fostering innovation. Blockchain startups and crypto exchanges may establish operations in Ukraine, creating jobs and driving economic activity. 2. Increased Government Revenue Taxing crypto profits ensures the government benefits financially from the growing crypto market. The exclusion of tax exemptions reduces the risk of evasion and increases revenue transparency. 3. Enhanced Investor Confidence A clear regulatory framework provides legal certainty, encouraging more investors to participate in Ukraine’s crypto market. International businesses may view Ukraine as a favorable destination for blockchain projects. Balancing Innovation and Regulation While Ukraine’s move is progressive, it aims to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and maintaining fiscal discipline. Opportunities Technological Advancement : Recognizing crypto legally can accelerate blockchain-based solutions across sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management. Market Expansion : Legalization could integrate Ukraine into the global crypto economy, enhancing its competitiveness. Challenges Tax Compliance : Ensuring that individuals and businesses adhere to the tax rules may require robust enforcement mechanisms. Regulatory Complexity : Balancing innovation with oversight demands meticulous policy design. Market Volatility : The inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies poses risks for retail investors. Comparison with Global Crypto Policies Ukraine’s approach mirrors trends in other nations: European Union The Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation provides a unified framework for member states, emphasizing investor protection and market stability. United States The U.S. is developing clearer rules, though debates around the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities persist. El Salvador The first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, El Salvador contrasts with Ukraine by offering tax exemptions for crypto gains. What Lies Ahead for Ukraine’s Crypto Market? Adoption Acceleration Legalization is expected to increase crypto adoption among businesses and individuals, making Ukraine a key player in the digital economy. Partnership Opportunities Collaborations between Ukrainian businesses and global crypto firms could flourish under the new regulatory regime. Educational Initiatives Awareness campaigns and educational programs will be crucial to ensure smooth integration of cryptocurrency into everyday financial activities. Conclusion Ukraine’s plan to legalize cryptocurrency by 2025 represents a landmark moment for the country’s financial and technological landscape. By crafting a regulatory framework that promotes transparency, taxation, and innovation, Ukraine is setting the stage to become a major player in the global crypto market.

However, its influence is primarily external, relying on viral trends. Lightchain AI’s Empowerment: Lightchain AI goes beyond buzz, integrating its community into the ecosystem through decentralized governance.

Additionally, DOGE’s low transaction fees make it an excellent choice for tipping and small-scale payments, driving its adoption for microtransactions. On the other hand, Lightchain AI offers distinct advantages that set it apart. Unlike DOGE, its applications extend far beyond payments, addressing complex challenges in sectors like finance, healthcare, and logistics. Moreover, Lightchain AI prioritizes sustainability through energy-efficient mechanisms, aligning with global efforts to reduce the environmental impact of blockchain technology. The Final Verdict: Which Is Truly the People’s Choice? Dogecoin (DOGE):Dogecoin remains a symbol of community-driven crypto, resonating with those who value simplicity and camaraderie. However, its lack of innovation and overreliance on meme culture raise questions about its long-term viability. Lightchain AI (LCAI):Lightchain AI combines innovation with inclusivity, offering solutions that extend far beyond memes and microtransactions. Its emphasis on scalability, energy efficiency, and real-world utility makes it a strong contender for the title of ""The People’s Choice.""

37587653,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109586,1734097825,Texas House Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to Strengthen State Finances,"Texas House Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to Strengthen State Finances Representative Giovanni Capriglione of the Texas House of Representatives has introduced a groundbreaking bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve for the state. The proposal aims to bolster Texas’s fiscal stability by accepting taxes, fees, and donations in Bitcoin , while positioning the state as a leader in cryptocurrency innovation. If enacted, this initiative could serve as a model for the U.S. Treasury to explore the potential of Bitcoin as a national strategic asset. Details of the Proposed Bill 1. Bitcoin as a Strategic Asset The bill emphasizes Bitcoin’s potential to: Act as a hedge against inflation , which Capriglione calls “the biggest enemy of investment.” Enhance the state’s financial resilience by diversifying its reserves. 2. Taxation and Fees in Bitcoin The legislation outlines plans for Texas to accept Bitcoin payments for: State taxes Administrative fees Voluntary donations 3. Strengthening Fiscal Soundness According to Capriglione, building a Bitcoin reserve will not only secure the state’s finances but also provide a win-win effect by ensuring asset appreciation over time. Texas’s Role in Bitcoin Innovation Texas has long been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption and blockchain innovation: Crypto Mining Hub The state is home to major Bitcoin mining operations , benefiting from its abundant energy resources and crypto-friendly policies. Pro-Business Environment With no state income tax and supportive regulations, Texas has attracted blockchain startups and crypto companies. Government Support for Blockchain Previous state initiatives include legislation to clarify the legal status of blockchain and crypto assets, fostering innovation in the sector. National Implications of the Texas Bitcoin Reserve 1. Testing Ground for U.S. Treasury If successful, the Texas Bitcoin reserve could pave the way for the U.S. Treasury to consider Bitcoin as a national reserve asset. 2. Inflation Hedge As the Federal Reserve grapples with rising inflation, Bitcoin’s fixed supply could serve as a hedge against currency devaluation. 3. Strengthening U.S. Leadership in Crypto By adopting Bitcoin at the state level, Texas could influence national policy, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. Potential Benefits of the Bitcoin Reserve 1. Diversification of State Assets A Bitcoin reserve diversifies Texas’s financial portfolio, reducing reliance on traditional fiat currencies. 2. Hedge Against Inflation Bitcoin’s limited supply and deflationary nature make it an ideal store of value during periods of inflation. 3. Increased Revenue Streams Accepting Bitcoin for taxes and fees could attract crypto-savvy businesses and individuals to the state. 4. Economic Growth Establishing Texas as a Bitcoin-friendly state could boost economic activity and job creation in the blockchain and fintech sectors. Challenges and Considerations While the proposal offers significant benefits, several challenges must be addressed: 1. Price Volatility Bitcoin’s price fluctuations could impact the value of state reserves, requiring careful management strategies. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Federal policies on cryptocurrency remain fragmented, posing potential conflicts with state-level initiatives. 3. Adoption Barriers Encouraging widespread adoption of Bitcoin for taxes and fees will require public education and robust infrastructure. 4. Cybersecurity Risks Safeguarding state-held Bitcoin assets will necessitate stringent security measures to prevent theft or hacking. Expert Opinions on the Proposal Supportive Voices Proponents argue that this bill showcases Texas’s leadership in crypto innovation and could set a precedent for other states and countries. Skeptical Perspectives Critics question Bitcoin’s suitability as a reserve asset due to its price volatility and nascent regulatory framework. Global Context: States and Nations Embracing Bitcoin Texas’s proposal aligns with global trends where governments and institutions explore Bitcoin adoption: El Salvador Adopted Bitcoin as legal tender and established a national Bitcoin reserve. Switzerland Several Swiss municipalities accept Bitcoin for tax payments. United States Miami and New York have introduced initiatives to integrate Bitcoin into municipal finances. Conclusion The proposal to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve in Texas reflects the state’s ambition to lead in cryptocurrency innovation while safeguarding its fiscal health. By accepting Bitcoin for taxes, fees, and donations, Texas aims to diversify its reserves and hedge against inflation. If successful, this legislation could inspire other states and potentially the federal government to embrace Bitcoin as a strategic asset. However, challenges such as volatility, regulatory hurdles, and public adoption must be carefully managed to ensure the initiative’s success.

In an attempt to recover the levels seen before the mass market-wide liquidation earlier this week, Solana has fallen short, retaining a 5.03% loss. However, with a 12.21% lapse in trading volume over the past 24 hours, scraping $3.5 billion, this downward momentum appears to be waning. Solana Becomes Preferred Choice Over Ethereum Electric Capital’s Developer Report showed that Solana is the number one ecosystem for new developers in 2024. Solana overtakes Ethereum for new devs. Source: Electric Capital. This marks the first time any other top layer 1 network has surpassed Ethereum for new developers since 2016, with 7,625 new developers reportedly building on Solana this year. The report also highlighted Solana as the fastest-growing large ecosystem in terms of monthly active developers, boasting an 83% year-on-year (YoY) growth. This impressive development has positioned the SOL ecosystem as a leader in low-fee use cases, accounting for 81% of all decentralized exchange (DEX) transactions and 64% of all NFT mint transactions across all chains. 2025 Rings Bullish for Solana: Is a $500 SOL Price Within Reach? These developments have raised speculators anticipations for the altcoin going into 2025, with optimistic scenarios suggesting a SOL price peak above $500. While credible, these targets hinge largely on continued adoption and regulatory advances. Asset manager Bitwise recently predicted that Solana’s growth would continue into 2025 , suggesting that “serious” projects would migrate to the SOL ecosystem to complement the network’s dominance in meme coins. As such, there are enough reasons to be optimistic about Solana, and with SOL-based ETFs becoming an increasing possibility once Trump takes office for a second time, the alt could see some real gains next year. Looking ahead, the technical setup for Solana suggests how such targets could play out. The SOL price currently remains bound in a descending channel, consolidating before its next move up. SOL / USDT 1D chart, descending channel pattern. Source: Binance. he daily 20SMA has proven to be stubborn resistance to recent breakout attempts, with the latest sparking today’s losses. Something expected to persist as long as the MACD line maintains its position below the signal line, a telling sign that the bulls have taken a back seat. However, the approaching strong support provided by the 50SMA stands to see a potential reversal. If this level holds, a subsequent successful breakout attempt would set a short-term price target around $272.50 approaching the end of the year, a 20% advance on current prices. This would reaffirm the early November breakout path of a cup-and-handle pattern forming since late 2021. Following this, the Solana price could see peaks of $380 within Q1 2025, representing a substantial 70% advance on current prices. This New Opportunity Could Bring Bigger Gains While Solana’s potential is undeniable, it’s no secret that its meteoric rise this year has been significantly bolstered by the meme coin scene – the foremost narrative driving gains this cycle.

XRP Price Surges As NYDFS Approves The Ripple Labs New Stablecoin RLUSD Ripple has bounced back from its downtrend influenced by the broader crypto market correction. In the past week, the XRP price surged over 6% to the $2.44 level and Its market cap has also surged 4.50%, signifying a decline in selling pressure Behind this recent turn around for Ripple, is the approval of its stable coin— RLUSD, by one of the toughest crypto regulators; New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This approval puts RLUSD in the class of stable and reliable digital assets. RLUSD is pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, and runs on the XRP Ledger and ETH blockchains. This new development makes Ripple a serious competitor to other stablecoin issuers like Circle and Paxos. Since the approval, Ripple's yearly gains have risen to 301%, although experts predict they may not exceed 350% before the year ends. IntelMarkets Poised To Deliver More Gains For Holders Before Year-end The launch of the RLUSD stablecoin by Ripple is expected to drive huge price gains for XRP but experts predict this gains would not match IntelMarkets' yearly gains. Since the launch of IntelMarkets' innovative AI-powered trading platform in Q2 of this year, it has consistently achieved feats that more established crypto trading platforms can not compete with. IntelMarkets has rolled out several innovations, including a Quantum Proof solution designed to prevent breaches in blockchain security, as well as a suite of advanced trading tools that simplify the trading process and maximize profits. Additionally, the platform's user-friendly interface makes it accessible to investors of all experience levels. With regular smart contract audits and continuous security upgrades, IntelMarkets has proven to be a secure haven for investors and their assets. Looking ahead, the platform is set to elevate blockchain security further with the upcoming Rodeum AI, the first AI-layered blockchain. Interestingly, since its presale launch, the platform has recorded impressive sellouts within two weeks of each presale stage, raising over $4.1 million in less than 8 months, a feat no other presale has achieved. With its 440% returns for investors, IntelMarkets stays ahead of tokens like XRP in terms of price gains. The best part?

37587351,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109591,1734097303,Microsoft CFO Hints at Exploring Cryptocurrencies Beyond Bitcoin,"Microsoft CFO Hints at Exploring Cryptocurrencies Beyond Bitcoin Microsoft’s Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood has indicated the company’s continued exploration of digital assets, sparking speculation about the tech giant’s potential interest in cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin (BTC) . The statement, reported by Jacob King of cryptocurrency newsletter WhaleWire , suggests a broader approach to digital asset reserves, despite the company’s prior decision against investing in Bitcoin. Microsoft’s Approach to Digital Assets 1. Recent Developments Hood stated that the Microsoft board is actively evaluating digital assets as part of its reserve management strategy. This signals a willingness to explore alternative cryptocurrencies and blockchain-based assets. 2. Stance on Bitcoin Microsoft shareholders recently rejected a proposal to invest in Bitcoin, citing concerns over volatility and suitability for corporate reserves. The board reiterated that while Bitcoin remains off the table for now, the company is monitoring cryptocurrency trends closely. Implications of Exploring Other Cryptocurrencies Microsoft’s openness to evaluating digital assets suggests it may be exploring opportunities in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem: 1. Diversification of Reserves Exploring a range of cryptocurrencies could provide Microsoft with a diversified and innovative approach to managing corporate reserves. 2. Interest in Emerging Cryptocurrencies Cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum (ETH) , which powers decentralized applications, or stablecoins , known for their price stability, might align with Microsoft’s interests in innovation and reduced volatility. 3. Strategic Opportunities Involvement in cryptocurrencies could strengthen Microsoft’s presence in blockchain technology and digital payments, complementing its existing cloud and enterprise solutions. Microsoft’s Broader Blockchain and Crypto Initiatives 1. Existing Blockchain Ventures Microsoft has been a pioneer in blockchain integration through its Azure Blockchain Service , enabling businesses to deploy decentralized applications efficiently. 2. Decentralized Identity Projects The company has invested in blockchain-based identity solutions, such as the ION Decentralized Identifier project built on the Bitcoin blockchain. 3. Potential Synergy with Web3 As Web3 technologies gain traction, Microsoft’s exploration of cryptocurrencies could align with its broader goals of innovation in decentralized platforms and metaverse applications . Challenges and Considerations 1. Regulatory Compliance Navigating global regulations for cryptocurrencies remains a critical challenge for corporations. Microsoft must ensure compliance with evolving standards for digital assets. 2. Volatility and Risk Management Cryptocurrencies are inherently volatile, requiring robust risk management frameworks to ensure stability in reserves. 3. Shareholder Sentiment Convincing shareholders, who have expressed reservations about Bitcoin, of the value of other cryptocurrencies will be a crucial step. Expert Opinions on Microsoft’s Move Support for Innovation Proponents argue that exploring cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin showcases Microsoft’s forward-thinking approach and its commitment to innovation. Cautious Optimism Some analysts emphasize the importance of thorough evaluation and strategic alignment to ensure any cryptocurrency involvement benefits Microsoft’s core business objectives. Potential Cryptocurrencies Microsoft Could Consider 1. Ethereum (ETH) Use Case : Powers smart contracts and decentralized applications. Potential Appeal : Aligns with Microsoft’s blockchain initiatives, such as enterprise solutions and decentralized identity. 2. Stablecoins Use Case : Reduce volatility by pegging value to fiat currencies or assets. Potential Appeal : Provides a low-risk entry into the cryptocurrency market. 3. Tokenized Assets Use Case : Represent real-world assets like real estate or stocks on blockchain. Potential Appeal : Offers diversification and innovation without the risks of traditional cryptocurrencies. What’s Next for Microsoft and Crypto? As Microsoft continues evaluating digital assets, several scenarios could unfold: 1. Strategic Partnerships Collaborations with blockchain platforms and cryptocurrency projects could enhance Microsoft’s tech ecosystem. 2. Gradual Adoption Incremental steps, such as accepting cryptocurrencies for certain services or investing in blockchain startups, might precede full-scale adoption. 3. Influence on Corporate Adoption Microsoft’s actions could set a precedent, influencing other corporations to explore digital assets. Conclusion Microsoft’s exploration of cryptocurrencies beyond Bitcoin underscores its commitment to staying ahead in a rapidly evolving digital economy. While shareholder opposition has temporarily sidelined Bitcoin investments, the company’s openness to evaluating other digital assets signals a strategic pivot toward embracing blockchain technology and innovation. As Microsoft continues to refine its approach, its decisions could shape the future of corporate cryptocurrency adoption and reinforce its position as a technology leader.

This marks a seven-point decline from the previous day but still places the index firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone . This sentiment index, developed by the software platform Alternative , uses a range from 0 to 100 —where 0 signifies extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed —to gauge investor sentiment. Despite the slight drop, the persistence in the “Extreme Greed” zone underscores the prevailing bullish sentiment in the crypto market. What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides an aggregated measure of market sentiment, capturing the emotional dynamics driving cryptocurrency prices. How It’s Calculated The index derives its value from six weighted factors: Volatility (25%) : Measures price fluctuations to gauge risk levels. Market Momentum/Volume (25%) : Tracks trading activity and price momentum. Social Media (15%) : Analyzes trends and engagement across platforms like X (formerly Twitter). Surveys (15%) : Collects direct investor sentiment through polls. Bitcoin Dominance (10%) : Examines Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%) : Evaluates search interest in cryptocurrency-related terms. Factors Behind the Decline to 76 1. Slight Market Cooling The crypto market experienced mild pullbacks in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) prices, leading to a dip in market momentum and sentiment. 2. Social Media Sentiment Online chatter around cryptocurrencies saw a decrease in engagement, impacting the social media factor of the index. 3. Reduced Market Activity A slight decline in trading volumes and transaction activity contributed to the lowered index value. Staying in the ‘Extreme Greed’ Zone Despite the drop, the index’s position in the “Extreme Greed” zone reflects robust market optimism. Key indicators include: 1. Strong Bitcoin Dominance Bitcoin continues to command a significant share of the market, maintaining bullish confidence among investors. 2. Institutional Inflows Institutional interest remains high, as evidenced by sustained inflows into Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. 3. Retail Enthusiasm Retail investors continue to flock to cryptocurrencies, particularly in the NFT and gaming sectors, contributing to market momentum. Historical Significance of the Extreme Greed Zone Bull Market Indicator Historically, a prolonged stay in the “Extreme Greed” zone has often preceded significant market rallies. Warning of Overheating However, excessive greed can signal market overextension, increasing the likelihood of a correction. Risks and Opportunities in the Current Sentiment Risks Overbought Conditions : Persistently high greed levels may indicate an overheated market, vulnerable to sharp corrections. FOMO-Driven Decisions : Fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to irrational investment behaviors. Opportunities Sustained Bullish Momentum : Continued optimism can drive further price appreciation, especially in leading cryptocurrencies. Entry Points for New Investors : The index serves as a tool to understand market psychology and identify strategic investment opportunities. What to Watch Next? Market Momentum A rebound in trading volumes and stronger price action could push the index back toward its recent highs. Volatility Events Any significant market event, such as regulatory developments or large-scale institutional movements, could shift sentiment drastically. Social Media Trends Increased engagement or viral discussions about cryptocurrencies could reignite excitement, boosting the index. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index’s drop to 76 signals a slight cooling of market sentiment, though it remains firmly in the “Extreme Greed” zone. This reflects a resilient optimism among crypto investors despite minor pullbacks in price momentum and trading activity. As the market continues to evolve, keeping a close watch on the index can offer valuable insights into investor sentiment, helping traders and investors navigate opportunities and risks effectively.

37587315,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=109597,1734097151,"Altcoin Season Index Holds Steady at 66, Signaling Continued Altcoin Dominance","Altcoin Season Index Holds Steady at 66, Signaling Continued Altcoin Dominance As of December 13, 2024 , the Altcoin Season Index stands at 66 , according to cryptocurrency price tracking platform CoinMarketCap (CMC) .

This metric provides valuable insights into market dynamics, especially for traders and investors seeking to diversify their crypto portfolios. Understanding the Altcoin Season Index What is the Altcoin Season Index? The Altcoin Season Index measures the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies relative to Bitcoin over the last 90 days . Altcoin Season : Defined as a period when 75% or more of the top 100 coins outperform Bitcoin. Bitcoin Season : Occurs when 25% or fewer coins outperform Bitcoin. Scoring Range The index uses a scale of 1 to 100 , with higher scores indicating dominance by altcoins. Exclusions Stablecoins and wrapped tokens are excluded to ensure the index reflects the performance of non-pegged cryptocurrencies. Key Factors Influencing the Current Index 1. Bitcoin’s Consolidation Bitcoin’s recent price stability around key levels has allowed altcoins to gain momentum. 2. Strong Altcoin Performance Several altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , and Polygon (MATIC) , have seen significant gains due to increased adoption, new developments, and partnerships. 3. Market Diversification Investors are exploring altcoins for higher returns, given Bitcoin’s relatively slower price movements during this period. What Does an Index Value of 66 Indicate?

Manage Risks Be prepared for volatility by setting stop-loss orders and maintaining a balanced portfolio. Challenges and Risks 1.

According to Eric Balchunas , Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Jacobs highlighted that investor demand for existing products remains relatively small, guiding the firm’s current strategy. Current Status of BlackRock’s Spot ETFs 1. Bitcoin Spot ETF (IBIT) BlackRock’s IBIT has been a significant milestone in mainstream cryptocurrency adoption, providing a regulated avenue for Bitcoin exposure. 2. Ethereum Spot ETF (ETHA) Following Bitcoin, ETHA was introduced to tap into the growing institutional and retail interest in Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. 3. Limited Adoption So Far Jacobs noted that only a small fraction of investors hold these ETFs, reflecting a cautious market sentiment toward crypto assets. Why No Spot Altcoin ETFs? 1. Focus on Market Leaders BlackRock has prioritized Bitcoin and Ethereum, given their dominance in the crypto market, accounting for over 65% of the total market capitalization. 2. Investor Familiarity Bitcoin and Ethereum are well-established assets with clear use cases, making them more appealing to conservative investors compared to altcoins. 3. Regulatory Challenges The regulatory landscape for altcoins remains uncertain, posing a significant barrier to launching spot ETFs for lesser-known cryptocurrencies. 4. Market Demand Jacobs emphasized that the firm’s decisions are guided by investor demand, which has not yet justified expanding into altcoin ETFs. Potential Benefits of Focusing on Bitcoin and Ethereum 1. Solidifying Trust By focusing on established assets, BlackRock strengthens investor confidence in cryptocurrency ETFs. 2. Navigating Volatility Bitcoin and Ethereum, while volatile, are less prone to extreme market fluctuations compared to many altcoins. 3. Streamlining Regulatory Processes Working with well-understood assets simplifies compliance with regulatory bodies, such as the SEC . Challenges of Ignoring Altcoins 1. Missed Opportunities Emerging altcoins, particularly those with innovative use cases in DeFi , gaming , and AI , could generate significant returns for early investors. 2. Competitive Disadvantage Other asset managers that offer altcoin ETFs may attract a broader investor base. 3. Evolving Market Trends With growing institutional interest in altcoins like Solana (SOL) , Cardano (ADA) , and Polygon (MATIC) , BlackRock risks falling behind in catering to emerging demands. What’s Next for BlackRock’s Crypto Strategy? While the firm has no immediate plans to launch spot altcoin ETFs, it remains a dominant player in the ETF space: 1. Monitoring Investor Interest BlackRock is likely to revisit its altcoin strategy if investor interest in alternative cryptocurrencies increases. 2. Focus on Thematic Innovation Thematic ETFs combining blockchain technology, AI, and digital assets could emerge as a new offering. 3. Enhancing Existing Products Expanding accessibility and liquidity for IBIT and ETHA could further boost adoption. The Bigger Picture: Cryptocurrency ETFs 1. Market Growth Cryptocurrency ETFs continue to gain traction, with global assets under management surpassing $50 billion in 2024. 2. Increasing Competition Asset managers such as Fidelity , VanEck , and Grayscale are expanding their crypto offerings, including altcoin ETFs. 3. Regulatory Evolution As regulations around altcoins mature, launching new ETFs could become more feasible and lucrative. Conclusion BlackRock’s focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs reflects its cautious and calculated approach to cryptocurrency investment. By prioritizing market leaders, the firm aims to solidify its position in a nascent yet promising asset class. However, with the growing interest in altcoins and their potential to disrupt traditional financial systems, BlackRock’s future crypto strategy will likely hinge on investor demand and regulatory clarity.

Solana (SOL): Recovery Unfolds Solana (SOL) has been among the early movers in this recovery race. The Layer-1 token has created a solid support above $200, changing hands above $225. Key technical indicators like the Commodity Channel Index (20) and 9-HMA suggest more positive price actions. Moreover, experts are optimistic about a strong rally after the recent downswing. DavidBelle, a crypto analyst and trader, expects the next leg up (25bp cut) might push the Solana price toward $330. Another crypto analyst, Kwantxbt, highlights the solid support at $220, hinting at a jump toward $260. The coming days promise to be exciting, especially with the anticipated overall market rally. As one of the best coins to invest in, the Layer-1 altcoin Solana (SOL) is primed for a huge leap, potentially creating a new all-time high and going on price discovery soon. Dogecoin (DOGE): Whales Buy the Dip The first and leading meme, Dogecoin (DOGE), resumes its upswing. The daily chart is green, highlighting growing interest among whales and retailers. Despite the latest scare, the Dogecoin price trades above $0.41, maintaining a 20% gain on the monthly chart. Crypto analyst DaanCrypto believes a retest of $0.45 might see DOGE reclaim higher levels. Meanwhile, Zigasjay suggests the fun-themed cryptocurrency might hit $5 during this bull cycle in 2025, positioning it among the best altcoins to invest in. In addition to bullish experts’ forecasts, technical indicators also hint at future gains. The 20-EMA and 9-HMA are bullish indicators, pointing to further upswings—one of the altcoins to watch out for. Behind the rising interest are its memetic appeal as the first memecoin and significant growth prospects. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Next Big Thing After Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE)? As one of the most fundamentally solid altcoins, IntelMarkets’ AI-powered trading platform sets it up for massive adoption and growth. Experts predict a 60x gain after Tier-1 exchange listings, primed to be the next big thing after popular names like Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE).

37587182,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392843,1734096782,Binance Triggers Crypto Market Buzz with Velodrome and Vana Listings,"The post Binance Triggers Crypto Market Buzz with Velodrome and Vana Listings appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange , has announced the listing of two new tokens: Velodrome Finance (VELODROME) and Vana (VANA). This news has stirred excitement in the crypto community, with both tokens seeing sharp price jumps following the announcement. Let’s explore what makes these projects stand out. Velodrome Finance: A New Liquidity Hub Velodrome (VELODROME) will be available for trading against USDT on Binance starting Friday, December 13. But what is Velodrome Finance? Velodrome is a decentralized exchange (DEX) designed as a liquidity hub for the superchain ecosystem. In simpler terms, it’s built to manage large amounts of liquidity, making it a key tool for growing blockchain networks. Binance has given Velodrome a special “seed tag” to help it shine among similar tokens. To make trading easier, Binance will enable trading bots and copy trading features within 24 hours of the listing. Source : Binance Announcement Just after the Binance announcement, the price of Velodrome skyrocketed around 185% to $0.4184 before stabilizing around $0.3272. The hype is real. This shows the impact of Binance listing in the crypto world. Source : Dexscreener Vana: Binance Launchpool’s New Star The second token is grabbing the spotlight with Vana (VANA), Binance’s 62nd Launchpool project. Vana is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain token, and users can farm it by staking BNB or FDUSD for two days starting December 14. This makes earning VANA tokens straightforward for Binance users. Here’s what we know about Vana: Total token supply : 120 million Airdrop rewards : 4.8 million VANA Initial circulating supply : 30,084,000 (25% of the total supply) Why so much buzz? Vana recently raised $25 million in a funding round led by Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, and Paradigm. The funds will support the ecosystem’s growth and reward its tech-savvy community. It’s clear that Vana’s team has big ambitions. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Trump’s US Strategic Crypto Reserve: Will Ethereum Join Bitcoin? , What to Expect Next The launches of Velodrome and Vana highlight Binance’s influence in shaping the crypto market.

Will these tokens maintain their growth? It’s too early to tell. But one thing is clear: both Velodrome and Vana are gaining traction, and the buzz around them isn’t going away anytime soon. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

37587349,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626951,1734096769,Mark Cuban says ignoring crypto cost his friend Kamala Harris the US election,"During his appearance on The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart , the billionaire tech mogul and Dallas Mavericks former owner Mark Cuban blamed his friend Kamala Harris’ election loss squarely on one thing: ignoring the crypto community. “Crypto had a lot to do with it,” Mark said. “A whole lot of young men voted against Kamala.” He revealed that he had warned Kamala months before the election, telling her that failing to understand and support crypto would alienate one of the most passionate voter demographics. Kamala, however, didn’t listen. Her administration’s stance on crypto, Mark argued, drove young male voters to Donald Trump, who capitalized on their frustration. Mark also threw outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler under the bus. He said the administration’s aggressive crypto policies, spearheaded by Gary, were disastrous for Kamala’s campaign. Kamala just didn’t care “Crypto is their family,” Mark explained on the podcast. “These guys aren’t just holding Bitcoin; they’re building projects, joining DAOs, and actively participating in decentralized ecosystems.” Instead, the administration doubled down on regulation. “Young people are sick of being ignored. They saw Trump as the guy who wasn’t going to destroy what they’re building.” Kamala’s relationship with crypto has been inconsistent at best. Her first public comments on the topic came in September 2024, during a fundraiser in New York City. At the event, she spoke about the importance of protecting consumers while also encouraging technological innovation. It was a calculated attempt to strike a balance, but Mark saw it as a missed opportunity to genuinely connect with voters. By October, Kamala’s campaign rolled out a broader economic vision called the “Opportunity Economy.” The plan included blockchain and crypto as tools for financial empowerment, particularly for Black Americans, 20% of whom had interacted with crypto. However, critics pointed out that the language in her proposals was vague and lacked the specificity that the community demands. Kamala’s team tried to appeal to Black male voters, a demographic where she was losing ground to Trump. They framed crypto as a way to promote entrepreneurship and financial inclusion. However, her broader policies—including marijuana legalization and small business support—were not enough to reverse the tide. Mark believes this was because her administration’s actions on crypto spoke louder than her campaign’s words. Mark Cuban teaches Jon Stewart the crypto basics While Mark’s frustration with Kamala dominated the conversation, he also spent time explaining the fundamentals of crypto to Jon Stewart. The comedian admitted early in the interview that he didn’t understand blockchain or cryptocurrencies, describing digital tokens as little more than gambling. Mark took the opportunity to break it down. He explained Bitcoin as “digital gold,” emphasizing its limited supply and ability to act as a store of value. Mark also pointed out the potential of blockchain to revolutionize funding, though he criticized the government for being slow to adapt. “The SEC’s classification of tokens as securities is ridiculous,” Mark said. “They’re creating barriers instead of opportunities.” Stewart joked that the discussion felt like a crash course in crypto. “This is Digital Currency for Dummies,” Stewart quipped . “I really didn’t know it so well and I want to know it.” Land a High-Paying Web3 Job in 90 Days: The Ultimate Roadmap",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Cryptopolitan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/mark-cuban-crypto-kamala-harris-us-election/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37587349.jpeg
37587108,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662059,1734096649,"Dogecoin Price Slump Looms, Analyst Points To Only One Lifeline","Dogecoin (DOGE) has entered a period of weakness, slipping roughly 16% from its November 23 local high of $0.4795. As the original meme cryptocurrency struggles to reclaim key technical levels, the consensus among some analysts is that DOGE’s ability to stabilize or recover may hinge almost entirely on an external factor: Bitcoin’s trajectory. Dogecoin Price At Risk Of Another Slump Technical analysis suggests that the previously well-respected uptrend line, established in mid-November, has now turned into a formidable barrier. After breaching this support line earlier in the week, Dogecoin bulls attempted several times to push the price back above it. Yet none of these efforts have succeeded. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA), who has been closely tracking the DOGE/USD 1-day chart, notes that DOGE is “getting rejected from the re test of this trend line that we were holding for almost a month on top of that it sits right in the macro .786 Fib.”—a technical zone often associated with significant turning points and potential reversals. Beyond the trend line, internal momentum indicators paint a challenging picture. Kevin emphasizes that the daily MACD for DOGE is showing “strong momentum to the downside,” a technical signal suggesting the market’s short- to mid-term bias may lean lower unless the broader crypto environment shifts. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Bought 210 million DOGE During Recent Correction – Bullish Signal? In his view, “It’s safe to say without a BTC move higher the more probable move for DOGE in the short to mid term is lower. A BTC move higher could save us though.” He identifies $0.32—the origin of the prior uptrend line—as a primary downside target. Should DOGE fail to hold above that level, traders may look toward the $0.29 to $0.26 range as potential next stops. In another post on X, Kevin emphasized that Dogecoin price pinned between two critical long-term Fibonacci levels. He describes DOGE as currently “trading between the macro golden pocket,” roughly at $0.47, and the macro 0.5 Fib level near $0.39. According to him, a firm break above or below these pivotal levels could trigger what he calls a “cascading” effect of “aggressive movement.” He adds: “My position is that DOGE is not in control of itself and it’s fate lies purely in BTC’s hands at the moment so overly focusing on the asset is sort of a waste of time. I see nothing telling me the cycle is over therefore this should head higher soon enough regardless of short term noise. Nothing else to do but sit back and wait if you’re a long term holder who got in early like myself.” However, there is at least one silver lining worth noting. Kevin mentions he is “tracking [a] potential hidden bullish divergence” on the DOGE daily chart. Hidden bullish divergences occur when price action continues to trend higher over a longer timeframe, while momentum indicators—like the Relative Strength Index (RSI)—trend lower. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals This pattern can sometimes signal that a market’s underlying strength is greater than it appears. It is, as the analyst puts it, “pretty textbook” at the moment, though it still needs the all-important help from Bitcoin. “Still need BTC to cooperate so nothing guaranteed,” Kevin remarks. What About Bitcoin? Kevin points out that Bitcoin is currently “squeezing” between an upward trend line of support and a macro golden pocket—levels derived from the previous bull market high to bear market low. This tightening price action suggests an imminent resolution: BTC is unlikely to remain compressed in this zone much longer. A decisive breakout, in either direction, seems imminent and could have far-reaching consequences. “This upwards consolidation cannot last much longer. We will get a bust in either direction very soon,” Kevin predicts. On the liquidity front, Kevin sees significant upside liquidity blocks for BTC, noting that “built up liquidity” over the last 48 hours aligns with the macro 1.703 Fibonacci level. He also mentions observing data that shows whales purchasing large options calls for MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock. Such purchases may reflect anticipation of a BTC move higher, given MicroStrategy’s well-known Bitcoin treasury holdings. If these whales and liquidity indicators are correct, and BTC does indeed push upward, DOGE might find the “one lifeline” it needs to stabilize and reverse its current downtrend. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.405.

DTX’s presale has raised over $10.3 million, and market analysts believe it will surpass $11 million by the end of 2024. BounceBit and Ondo Finance Revolutionize DeFi with Real-World Asset Integration Recently, a Bitcoin re-staking project, BounceBit, integrated Ondo Finance’s tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) within its CeDeFi V2 platform. This move was a massive step toward its 2025 vision of blending RWAs with DeFi. Since its November 12, 2024, launch, BounceBit CeDeFi V2 has recorded increased activity, with platform inflows hitting $20 million. New features available on the platform include Auto, Fixed, and Manual yield strategies, which fueled $10 million in inflows within an hour. Meanwhile, ONDO was trading at $1.84 on December 12, up 7.06% in the past week. Analysts say ONDO will rise to $1.99 this month as more partnerships are executed on Ondo’s network. However, investors have turned to DTX, which has 50x growth prospects in 2025. Cardano Gains Bullish Momentum as Exchanges Record Outflows ADA showed bullish momentum after forming a positive price action pattern on the daily charts. On December 11, 2024, the Cardano coin gained over 8%, enabling it to start recovering from a 23% drop recorded the previous day. The rally was caused by increased interest in ADA from whales and long-term investors, highlighting growing confidence in Cardano’s future, according to Coinglass. Market data showed massive ADA outflows from exchanges, reaching $185.89 million since early December. Technically, ADA has remained strong above its psychological support at $1. Analysts forecast a possible 15% increase to $1.25 in the coming weeks. ADA was trading at $1.17 on December 12, down 2.17% in the past week. Market experts believe ADA will rise to $1.38 this month as more developments happen on the Cardano network. Despite the expected growth, analysts are turning to DTX, which offers 50x growth potential in 2025. DTX Promises 50x Gains in 2025: Is This the Best Presale Coin to Buy Now?

37589440,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319261,1734096615,Hong Kong’s OSL Adds Toncoin to OTC Trading Amid Rising Institutional Demand,"OSL Digital Securities, Hong Kong’s premier regulated digital asset platform, has introduced Toncoin ( TON ) into its over-the-counter (OTC) trading services to extend its offers to professional investors. According to a press release , the addition enables eligible users to trade TON against USD, USDT, and HKD. It also benefits from OSL’s secure custody services and fiat on/off-ramp solutions. With TON’s strong alignment with Telegram, a widely used messaging platform, the token has gained significant traction globally, particularly within the Web3 community. What Does This Mean For TON? The Open Network, designed for Telegram integration, prioritizes scalability, security, and cross-chain interoperability. Since its launch, TON attracted substantial funding. It includes a reported $250 million investment from Pantera Capital and a recent $5 million tranche by OKX . According to a September report, TON has surpassed 1 billion transactions . The Open Network (TON) has surpassed 1 billion total transactions in the wake of an airdrop, which also caused two major network outages. #Telegram #TON https://t.co/qqOymx19IO — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 3, 2024 Innovations like gasless transactions and partnerships have primarily driven the TON growth. However, a high-profile DOGS memecoin airdrop , which accounted for 30% of activity, caused two network outages. During this surge, the network processed 20 million transactions and reached a record daily active user count, though it also faced rising fees and overwhelmed validators. It remains to be seen how the addition in Hong Kong will affect the whole ecosystem’s stability. Increasing Market Demand Amid TON Growth Introducing these trading pairs (TON/USD, TON/USDT, and TON/HKD) enables professional investors to capitalize on The Open Network and gain easy access to it in Hong Kong. In addition to trading, OSL’s services, including secure custody and fiat interoperability, offer a robust framework for new investors. The integration also aligns with broader market trends. Institutional and retail interest in blockchain projects linked to widely-used applications like Telegram continues to rise. A report fro m last year showed that Telegram had $400 million in crypto by the end of 2023, with digital assets contributing 40% to its revenue through integrated wallets and digital collectibles. Despite generating $342.5 million in revenue, Telegram faced an operating loss of $108 million for the year. Notably, Tether, in collaboration with Phoenix Group and Green Acorn, has also announced the launch of a Dirham-pegged stablecoin on the TON blockchain . This move comes amid Tether’s growing presence on the TON blockchain. Its USDT stablecoin achieved unprecedented adoption, reaching one billion USDT within six months—a record in Tether’s history. The global stablecoin market, valued at $150 billion, is projected to grow significantly, potentially reaching $2.8 trillion by 2028. Tether’s USDT, which holds a dominant market cap of over $115 billion, continues to focus on regions like Turkey, Argentina, and Brazil, where high inflation drives demand for stable digital currencies.

In a blog post, Binance highlighted that its inflows surpassed those of 10 other exchanges combined. The company attributed this growth to increased global adoption of digital assets, citing regulatory successes, historic price milestones, and the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as major drivers. “These developments have driven millions of users to Binance, increasing its global user base to almost 250 million people,” Binance said in its Dec. 12 report. DefiLlama data shows Bybit ranking second in inflows at $8.2 billion, followed by OKX with $5.3 billion. Other exchanges like BitMEX, Robinhood, and HTX recorded inflows of $3.45 billion, $3.17 billion, and $2.12 billion, respectively. In contrast, platforms such as Bitstamp, Bitfinex, and Crypto.com experienced outflows of $2.75 billion, $1.77 billion, and $358.1 million. The ranking excludes exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini, as they haven’t provided “wallet transparency” with proof-of-reserves. DefiLlama clarified, “While they report assets held due to being a publicly listed company, they haven’t provided wallet transparency. This is also why we haven’t added cbBTC, as we track wallets holding BTC for such projects.” Binance and other exchanges have also seen a rise in institutional activity. According to a Dec. 3 CryptoQuant report, the average Bitcoin deposit on Binance increased from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC in 2024. Similarly, USDt deposits surged from $19,600 to $230,000. Binance noted it became the first centralized exchange (CEX) to surpass $100 trillion in trading volume, as cited by CCData.

Homo Shiba Inu (HOMOSHIB), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because HOMOSHIB is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Homo Shiba Inu can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Homo Shiba Inu could become the next viral memecoin. Homo Shiba Inu launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Homo Shiba Inu on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Homo Shiba Inu by entering its contract address – 6ej331YS6ECER9uk784JZwiajc83YsrqDehvGTpoRpPh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like HOMOSHIB.

Could XRP Flip ETH?,"Cryptocurrency fans are excited about the alleged Trump administration taking over, with the key impression being cast on Ethereum (ETH) or Ripple (XRP). These two tokens, which have long been competitors in the altcoin world, have some advantages and disadvantages. However, recent shifts indicate that Trump’s rule may be more beneficial for Ripple’s XRP regarding the current situation with the SEC and potential shifts in the Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) landscape. With the increasing focus of Donald Trump on DeFi, Ethereum stands a chance, but with XRP potentially paving the way for several new use cases along with the likelihood of an XRP-backed ETF, the probability shifts. Ripple’s Meteoric Growth Fueled by ETF Expectations Ripple's XRP increased tremendously within the recent time frame as it now has a price of $2.47 and a market capitalization of $141.23 billion. This is largely because of people's expectations for the growth of an ETF focusing on XRP. WisdomTree applying for an XRP-based ETF is a huge step in Ripple's remarkable timeline. The approval of such an ETF would practically invite every institutional buyer to invest in the XRP market, resulting in a surge in inflow to the market by billions of dollars, if not more. This will be a revolutionary achievement, raising XRP as one of the crypto assets regarded as an institutional investment class. Regarding its battle with the SEC, Ripple’s legal residency in the US remains a pillar in this equation. The conflict between parties concerning whether XRP is a security has made the token's growth uncertain. Still, market experts are convinced that the possible resignation of Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair, combined with the election of Donald Trump and his administration, which is more prone to crypto, will change the game in XRP’s favor. This optimism has caused bullish belief, further exaggerated by Ripple's progress into CBDCs and its cooperation with central banks across the globe. Ripple's strategy to expand its product offerings beyond remittances, including stablecoins and CBDCs, has helped position XRP as a competitive alternative to Ethereum. This is illustrated by Ripple's agreement with the UAE to issue a stablecoin backed by the Dirham. Such developments occur alongside an increased market cap, which, though still lagging behind Ethereum’s $480.64 billion, currently stands at $141.23 billion after XRP's recent surge—a quite impressive figure. The Decentralized Dynamic of Ethereum Currently priced at $3,990.60 with a market cap of $480.64 billion, Ethereum has allocated enough resources to maintain its extensiveness in the DeFi ecosystem and dominate the smart contract industry. The transition allowed staking and built a stronger user base for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, Ethereum is facing competition from Ripple. New projects have emerged targeting specific niches such as CBDCs. Replacing the approach strategy could be beneficial, whereas Ethereum still has the edge in both DeFi and NFT focus moving forward. If XRP makes wise decisions, it may reach a level where it can compete with Ethereum’s widespread dominance. Rexas Finance (RXS): A Growing Star With Great Potential While Ethereum and Ripple continue their grappling match for market supremacy, another altcoin worth noting is Rexas Finance (RXS), due to its developmental potential. Rexas is increasingly finding favor among investors as it provides an all-in-one ecosystem that seeks to tokenize real-world assets. Currently, Rexas is in stage 10 of its presale, with the token price rising to $0.150. It had earlier sold more than 330 million tokens and raised about $25 million in another token sale. The presales' success indicates the RXS market is expanding as people begin to see its ability to change transactional exchanges in the market through blockchain technology for asset tokenization. What Are the Features and Tokenomics of Rexas Finance? Rexas Finance seeks to provide financial inclusion by targeting traditional assets such as real estate, commodities, and high-end jewelry, which are often difficult to invest in. The platform enables its users to tokenize and exchange partial ownership of such assets, thus creating liquidity and offering transparency. Among its key features are the Rexas Launchpad for decentralized project funding, Rexas Token Builder for token creation, and Rexas GenAI for NFT marketing creation. These features make Rexas Finance a dynamic platform that addresses multiple use cases. RXS has a self-sufficient and well-planned tokenomics model. Out of the total 1 billion tokens, 42.5% are for the presale, 22.5% for staking rewards, and 15% for liquidity purposes. The rest are carefully utilized in the treasury, farming, marketing, the team, their partners, bonuses, etc., creating a balanced structure for growth. Certik Audit and Giveaway Rexas Finance has been audited by Certik, one of the biggest security firms in blockchain. This audit increases investor confidence by demonstrating that the platform adheres to high security and transparency standards. The RXS project also offers early presale attendees a $1 million bounty. To enhance the project's visibility and improve their positions on the waiting list, bounty hunters can complete quest tasks, such as promoting the project on social media platforms or marketing the presale to friends. Winners can grab about 50,000 RXS tokens. This not only helps community growth but also encourages early investment. Forecast for Rexas Finance According to many projections, RXS will experience massive growth and appreciation. The token is predicted to appear on major platforms with a price of $0.20 in the first quarter of 2025, promising higher returns for presale subscribers. By the end of 2025, the price may hit $5 to $6, thanks to the platform’s ecosystem growth and user acquisition. Long-term targets indicate that with increasing demand for asset tokenization and the formation of alliances, RXS value might reach $125 per token by 2026. Conclusion With Trump's administration, the crypto markets should expect significant changes. Ethereum remains a leader in the DeFi space, while Ripple’s XRP is steadily growing thanks to potential ETF approvals and CBDC projects. Amid this competition, Rexas Finance has a promising future in asset tokenization and its robust ecosystem, making it a good option for investors seeking growth in the evolving crypto market.

37586813,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626933,1734095544,"DOGE’s Elon Musk is in a fix with the SEC and Gensler: ‘Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?’","Tesla CEO Musk’s political influence continues to rub certain individuals the wrong way. His battle with the US Security and Exchanges Commission (SEC) is very much alive, and with outgoing chair Gary Gensler still in office, the political war is undoubtedly far from over. Gary Gensler and the SEC have revived an investigation into Musk’s company, Neuralink. The regulator issued a 48-hour notice for the DOGE co-head to agree to a monetary settlement or face several charges. Elon Musk shared a letter from his attorney, Alex Spiro, confirming the allegations on his official X account, in which he remarked, “Oh Gary, how could you do this to me?” Neuralink has long been scrutinized by several government agencies since 2023 when lawmakers expressed concerns over the safety of its brain implants. The company is now being criticized for overstating its product’s safety features, fueling doubts about its reliability. The back and forth between Musk and Gensler With the new charges coming in, Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, addressed SEC Chair Gary Gensler in a letter posted on the social media platform X. Image of the letter Elon Musk’s lawyer shared in response to the SEC’s legal action. Source: @elonmusk ( X) The December 12-issued letter highlights that the SEC has given Musk a 48-hour window to agree to a settlement, or he will face charges on “numerous counts.” However, the SEC has not disclosed the specifics of these allegations; instead, it is referring to a multi-year investigation into Neuralink. Musk’s attorney described the ongoing investigations as an “unwavering campaign” to target the billionaire, given his strong ties to President-elect Donald Trump, another “foe” of Gary Gensler. The Tesla CEO doesn’t lack confidence when speaking about his feelings toward the financial regulator. When the US SEC chair first announced his resignation, Elon Musk took to X to describe the agency as ineffective, suggesting the possibility of dismantling it. Yesterday, Musk called the agency “just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work,” and went on to say that the agency was “wasteful,” claiming that he heard employees only “work once a month.” The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work https://t.co/5w9ajcS6bf — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 12, 2024 Vivek Ramaswamy, Elon Musk’s partner and co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), has also publicly criticized the SEC severally, specifically for ignoring certain violations in the stock markets. “When an agency like the SEC is so repeatedly and thoroughly embarrassed in federal court for ignoring the law, it loses its legitimacy as a law enforcement entity,” Ramaswamy posted on X. The crypto community delighted with Gensler’s exit The crypto community sees Gary Gensler’s departure as a big positive. Crypto enthusiasts believe that his January 2025 exit will end a harsh regulatory regime against the industry. All eyes now fall on Paul Atkins, the incoming SEC chair, who is expected to actualize Donald Trump’s promises by implementing more crypto-friendly reforms. Analysts expect that under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC may move away from aggressive tactics that prioritize high-profile penalties over meaningful results. Atkins was a former SEC commissioner under President George W. Bush and a former staff member at the agency. He believes the US should foster an environment that encourages more crypto companies to operate within the country. During his tenure at the SEC, Paul Atkins worked under Richard Breeden, who chaired the regulator from 1989 to 1993. Breeden, now leading Breeden Capital Management, praised his collaboration with Atkins as “superb in every way.” Breeden told Bloomberg that digital-asset supporters have reason to celebrate Atkins’ nomination. “If I were in the crypto industry, I’d be excited to have such a knowledgeable and thoughtful person overseeing regulation, knowing you’d likely receive fair and balanced oversight,” he said in the interview.

37586545,https://nulltx.com/?p=135671,1734095272,Polkadot vs Toncoin vs JetBolt: Which Altcoin will Reign Supreme this Holiday Season,"With the holiday season right around the corner, many are anticipating who among Polkadot (DOT), Toncoin (TON), and JetBolt (JBOLT) will climb the ladder. Polkadot’s highly anticipated 2.0 upgrade and Toncoin’s 22.2% increase this month are making a major buzz in the community. On the other side of the altcoin arena, JetBolt is emerging as a key player to watch out for following its astonishing presale success—having sold over 150 million tokens. Backed by zero-gas technology, JetBolt is becoming an appealing choice for whales. So, if you’re curious to know which of these altcoins, Polkadot, Toncoin, and JetBolt, might reign supreme this holiday season—keep on reading to find out. Can Polkadot 2.0 Push DOT to New Heights? At its current price of $8.94, Polkadot (DOT) has shown a remarkable 75.8% growth over the thirty days. However, the last seven days saw a 15.0% decline, highlighting DOT’s volatility. While the surge reflects its potential for significant popularity, the recent dip serves as a reminder of the market’s unpredictable nature. DOT’s 7-day trading chart from CoinGecko showing recovery from a mid-week dip. Despite strong buying activity pushing Polkadot’s On-Balance-Volume (OBV) to new highs, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 46.94 is showing lower highs, suggesting that Polkadot’s bullish momentum may be weakening. Analysts remain divided on Polkadot’s near-term trajectory. A drop below $10.50 is possible, as this level hasn’t solidified as a firm support. However, long-term sentiment remains optimistic, with predictions of a rebound driven by its anticipated 2.0 upgrade, set to launch in early 2025. This upgrade promises improved scalability, flexibility, and developer access, reinforcing Polkadot’s position as a major player in the blockchain space. Adding to the optimism, analysts like Crypto VBenz have suggested Polkadot could break its all-time high, with one enthusiast remarking, “$DOT chart is primed to absolutely rip”. What’s the Tea Behind JetBolt’s Presale Success? The crypto market is taking notice of JetBolt (JBOLT), driving its meteoric rise in the altcoin market. With over 150 million JBOLT tokens sold during its presale, this innovative project is gaining momentum as enthusiasts and whales alike flock to explore this zero-gas technology token. JetBolt, powered by the Skale Network, eliminates gas fees entirely, enabling fast and seamless transactions. This technology is a game-changer for blockchain gaming, SocialFi, Web3, and dApp ecosystems. What makes Jetbolt extra appealing is the AI-powered crypto tool. It aggregates market data and news, while JetBolt’s intuitive UX enhances accessibility and utility for users. Its easy-to-use staking system, paired with a user-friendly Web3 wallet, redefines engagement by making crypto staking fun. And that’s not all. The presale offers exclusive perks including Alpha Boxes and discounts for early buyers of up to 25% extra JBOLT tokens. With its groundbreaking features and a growing community, JetBolt is quietly positioning itself as a disruptive force in the crypto market. Moreover, the presale price of JetBolt tokens rises daily at presale. Is Toncoin on a Roll or Gonna Fall? Toncoin (TON) stands out with its seamless integration into Telegram, granting access to millions of users and boosting its usability. This unique feature, combined with its scalability and impressive transaction volume—over $51.97 billion in transactions last week—has captivated both retail traders and whales. As one of the most innovative projects in the crypto space, Toncoin is quietly gaining momentum among seasoned market players. Currently trading at $6.44 with a market cap of $16.4 billion, Toncoin has surged 23.0% in a month. Despite a drop in profitability to 65% of wallets, a rebound in its RSI to 54.59 hints at potential recovery. With strong support at $5.68 and recent resistance breaking at $6.30, Toncoin could target $6.99 or higher in the coming weeks. Whether it’s a hidden gem or the next big breakout, only time will tell. Final Thoughts: Who Among Polkadot, Toncoin, and JetBolt Will Dominate? It’s beginning to look a lot like the holidays for next generation altcoins like JetBolt, as its zero-gas revolution continues to capture the attention of crypto enthusiasts and whales alike. While Polkadot and Toncoin showcase impressive growth and innovation, JetBolt’s presale success and cutting-edge technology are positioning it as a standout contender this holiday season. With Polkadot’s 2.0 upgrade on the horizon, Toncoin leveraging Telegram’s vast user base, and JetBolt redefining crypto utility, the competition for which altcoin will reign supreme this holiday season is heating up.

The focus of many has also shifted to Rexas Finance (RXS), a new blockchain project which is currently in its presale phase. RXS has impressed experienced investors with, among other things, its new ideas, communities, and strategies, including top holders in the SOL and XRP communities. Impressive Presale Success Rexas Finance (RXS) has accomplished wide success in its presale phase due to the strong value that supports its concept and the increasing acceptance around the blockchain world. During Stage 1, the token started at 0.03 dollars. During Stage 9, it sold at 0.125 dollars and quickly bought out, showcasing huge interest from the investor circle and even promising participation from Solana and XRP fans. The core of this impressive demand resides in Rexas Finance’s ecosystem, which specializes in tokenizing real-world assets ( RWA). This solution brings great value to the table with increased liquidity, ease of access, and enhanced security for managing assets on the blockchain. Currently in Stage 10 at $0.150 a token, the presale is only projected to continue to sell out faster as it picks up pace. By allowing the public presale to take priority over raising funds through a venture capital firm, Rexas Finance guarantees a fair balance of tokens and increased active participation from the community. This helps promote the project framework as decentralized, allowing it to stand out against the competitive blockchain space. The Appeal of Rexas Finance: Innovation Meets Real-World Utility Rexas Finance offers one of the best solutions for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. Their innovative approach allows the general masses to tokenize and own real-world assets, such as real estate on a blockchain, a revolutionary idea. This is how blockchain solves many real-world issues by providing improved liquidity, accessibility, and security for asset management. Most crypto projects are about speculation and who can get rich quicker, not Rexas Finance. Rexas Finance is built on actual use cases. Some of its products are the Rexas Token Builder, which allows customers with no programming skills to build their tokens, and Rexas GenAI, which assists NFT designers in developing one-of-a-kind assets. Also, Rexas Treasury includes multi-chain yield farming features that let users earn interest on multiple chains. The involvement of top-tier investors in RXS from the SOL and XRP communities makes sense, as Rexas Finance can become an ecosystem changemaker. Almost every prediction placed RXS in a significantly better position in the market in terms of values. Rexas Finance is all-encompassing, converting financial and real-world assets, making it a must-have in one’s portfolio. Rexas Finance Security Rexas Finance has made a move to earn credibility and win the confidence of institutional and retail investors. Its recent inclusion on CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap virtually raised its profile, allowing its investors to get real-time information regarding RXS’s market activities. Listings of this nature are usually regarded as important milestones for new crypto projects as they enhance credibility and expand exposure. Equally important is completing a Certik audit, recognized as one of the most authoritative security checks in the blockchain sphere. This certification guarantees that the auditor's smart contracts focusing on the Rexas Finance system are risk and threat-free, allowing potential investors who are also risk-averse to be at ease. Community Engagement: Building Momentum Through a $1 Million Giveaway Rexas Finance went beyond the regular marketing strategy approaches with a million-dollar giveaway that has enticed more than 450,000 entries. The top 20 winners are set to receive 50,000 RXS tokens each. This campaign sparked great interest and engagement in the cryptocurrency community. The giveaway is more than just a promotional tool. It shows the projects’ dedication to developing a sustainable social ecosystem. Participants are invited to interact with Rexas Finance’s social media outlets and ask others to participate in the presale. This type of community engagement is essential in any blockchain-based project that would like to grow in the long run, as it helps cultivate a community of users who would promote the project organically. Conclusion: A Rising Contender with Unmatched Potential With Solana and Ripple making a loud noise in the market due to their recent bullish runs, it is interesting to note that Rexas Finance seems to be gaining popularity among their top holders. RXS has a unique structure, high-quality security, and an open-ended growth strategy, making it a remarkable project in the billion-dollar crypto market. The Rexas Finance token has an active campaign underway with its presale phase 10 and other prizes, including a $1 million to be given out. Rexas Finance is an organization bringing change, not just focusing on creating a token. For those looking for the next transformational launch, RXS has great potential and utility centered around the community.

Significant Fundraising Amid Industry Recovery The Avalanche Foundation has raised $250 million through a private token sale of its native cryptocurrency, AVAX . The funding round, led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly, and ParaFi Capital, saw participation from more than 40 investors. This marks one of the most significant fundraising events in the cryptocurrency sector since the market downturn of 2022, second only to Ava Labs’ $350 million raise last year. This funding reinforces the foundation’s robust financial standing, with AVAX tokens worth approximately $3 billion already under its control. The proceeds are expected to accelerate the foundation's efforts to enhance blockchain scalability and drive adoption. Preparing for the Avalanche9000 Upgrade The Avalanche9000 network upgrade, scheduled for December 16, is a transformative step in the platform's evolution. By introducing a subscription model for validators, the upgrade aims to reduce upfront costs from 2,000 AVAX to a monthly fee of 1.33 AVAX. This change is designed to lower the barrier to entry for validators, potentially increasing network participation and decentralization. The upgrade will also transition Avalanche into a network of interconnected Layer 1 (L1) blockchains linked through a primary chain. This architecture aims to address liquidity silos by enabling interchain messaging for seamless capital and transaction sharing. Over 500 L1 blockchains are currently in development, spanning applications such as tokenization, gaming, payments, and institutional programs. Boosting Adoption with Retroactive Incentives The foundation has introduced the Retro9,000 program to encourage ecosystem development, allocating $40 million in retroactive grants. This allocation includes up to $2 million in referral incentives aimed at attracting innovative projects and developers to the platform. Gaming projects like *Off the Grid* and *Shrapnel* have already integrated Avalanche’s blockchain technology, showcasing its utility in Web3 applications. Competitive Landscape and Investor Confidence Avalanche’s focus on scalability and cost-efficiency aligns with broader trends in blockchain innovation, where platforms like Ethereum and Polkadot are also pushing for interoperability and lower transaction costs. However, Avalanche9000’s unique design could give it an edge in addressing liquidity and usability challenges. Galaxy Capital’s Global Head of Trading, Jason Urban, emphasized the strategic importance of this initiative, saying, “We are providing Avalanche with the strategic resources and services needed to foster institutional participation and long-term growth, ensuring they can lead the next wave of blockchain adoption with Avalanche9000.” AVAX Performance and Future Outlook The announcement has positively impacted AVAX’s market performance, with the token rising over 10% in the last 24 hours to $52.30. According to CoinGecko, with a market capitalization of $21 billion, AVAX is the 12th largest cryptocurrency. Dragonfly Managing Partner Haseeb Qureshi spoke positively about the way forward for AVAX and the upcoming upgrade, stating, “Avalanche's upcoming Avalanche9,000 upgrade represents a pivotal step toward advancing the decentralized finance ecosystem. We believe Avalanche is uniquely positioned to capture the growing momentum in Web3 and blockchain scalability.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

XRP (XRP) XRP has experienced significant growth in recent months. Over the past six months, its price has surged by 408.55%. In the last month alone, XRP’s value jumped by 288.12%. Even in the past week, it saw a positive change of 2.22%. This upward momentum has caught the attention of many in the crypto community. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.22 and $2.95. The 10-day simple moving average is $2.42, while the 100-day average stands at $2.37. These figures suggest a consistent upward trend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.27, indicating that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level of 0.0156 points toward potential continued growth. The nearest resistance level is at $1.46. Breaking it could see ADA targeting the next resistance at $1.73, representing increases of about 20% and 30% from current prices. Support levels are at $0.92 and $0.65. Staying above these is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum. With its recent strong performance, ADA could continue upward if it overcomes resistance. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has seen significant movement recently. Over six months, its price surged by 175.24%. In the last month alone, ADA jumped by 84.69%. However, the past week saw a slight pullback with a price change of -4.63%, indicating some short-term volatility.

The Relative Strength Index at 56.49 and Stochastic at 56.92 suggest that ADA is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level at 0.0218 points to a potential bullish signal. Based on this data, ADA may be poised for further growth. The nearest resistance level is at $1.46. Breaking it could see ADA targeting the next resistance at $1.73, representing increases of about 20% and 30% from current prices. Support levels are at $0.92 and $0.65.

37587999,https://invezz.com/?p=2386500,1734094800,"Dogecoin price to jump 7x in the next 7 weeks, but this DOGE alternative will rise 28x","With its fantastic price momentum, dogecoin (DOGE) keeps the front stage in the crypto scene. At $0.4603, DOGE has increased by 2.04% in the past 24 hours. The token has risen 130% over the past thirty days and by about 400% in the past three months, indicating a strong positive attitude among investors. Based on the present trend, Dogecoin is expected to reach a 7x price increase during the next seven weeks, securing its position among the most talked-about coins. Though Dogecoin’s increases are noteworthy, another token— Rexas Finance (RXS)—is positioned to outperform DOGE with a startling 28x price explosion in the same period. Dogecoin’s bullish indicators The strong performance of Dogecoin can be ascribed to necessary market signals and rising investor confidence. A relative strength index (RSI) of 45.59 shows neutral momentum, leaning more toward optimism. Meanwhile, the average directional index (ADX) shows a strong increasing trend at 39.59. The Parabolic SAR also indicates a steady upward trend, supporting the favorable situation for DOGE. Furthermore, the price of Dogecoin is now trading above $0.420, implying solid support at this level. These technical signals point to Dogecoin’s likely continuation of its increasing velocity, maybe yielding a 7x return to investors by late January 2025. Rexas Finance (RXS): the DOGE alternative set for 28x gains Although Dogecoin’s 7x potential is remarkable, Rexas Finance (RXS) shows to be a better investment choice with a forecasted 28x price rise in the same period. Currently costing $0.125, Rexas Finance has become rather popular during its presale and has raised an incredible $25.11 million as it proceeds through its ninth stage. Rexas Finance is founded on a firm basis of invention, unlike Dogecoin, which mainly depends on community attitude. Acting as a Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenizing platform, RXS closes the physical and digital spheres. Without coding knowledge, its unique environment lets people and companies tokenize real-world assets, including intellectual property, commodities, and real estate. This creates unprecedented chances for asset ownership and monetization in the blockchain environment. Essential ecosystem tools are the Rexas Token Builder and Rexas Launchpad. These solutions enable consumers to produce and control tokenized assets efficiently, opening asset tokenizing to a wider audience. This ability makes Rexas Finance a leader in the fast-expanding RWA market. One of the most reliable blockchain security assessments available in the market is the Certik audit Rexas Finance (RXS) has undergone. This certification gives investors—both retail and institutional—confidence in the security and dependability of the platform, which attracts them. The success of the presale for RXS shows rising investor curiosity. Since its first stage, the token’s price has increased more than four times, indicating strong demand. Analysts now project RXS may reach $3.5 by mid-January 2025, providing an unmatched 28x return to early adopters. With a $1 million giveaway campaign already drawing over 430,000 entries, Rexas Finance has enhanced its appeal even more. The project will award twenty victors $50,000 worth of RXS tokens, strengthening its community and encouraging long-term devotion. While Dogecoin remains an exciting prospect with its 7x potential, Rexas Finance offers a far more significant upside with a projected 28x return. The difference lies in their use cases and market positioning. While Rexas Finance (RXS) offers actual value via its tokenizing system, Dogecoin’s value is mostly driven by speculative trading and community buzz. Conclusion Dogecoin’s price momentum and excellent technical indications make it a good choice for short-term gain-seeking investors. However, those looking for transformative growth and short- and long-term potential may find Rexas Finance a more compelling choice. Its innovative ecosystem, Certik certification, and substantial presale success indicate that RXS is not just another altcoin but a revolutionary project redefining the RWA space. The decision ultimately boils down to investment goals. Dogecoin is one of the best contenders for those wishing to ride the meme coin frenzy. Rexas Finance is the obvious choice, though, if you’re looking for a more creative idea with exponential expansion. Don’t miss the chance to be part of this explosive growth—invest in Rexas Finance (RXS) today and position yourself for life-changing returns!

37586308,https://finbold.com/?p=219140,1734094800,"Astar Network announces Astar Surge, a new pre-deposit campaign","Astar ( ASTR ), the cross-chain Web3 collective network, has unveiled Astar Surge, an innovative pre-deposit campaign set to accelerate the integration with Soneium, according to the updates shared with Finbold on Friday, December 13. The campaign will help bring ASTR tokens to Soneium’s Ethereum ( ETH ) Layer-2 ( L2 ) and lay the groundwork for a successful mainnet launch. Launching on December 18, the campaign will thus allow ASTR token holders to earn rewards while helping Astar’s expand its Web3 ecosystem. The Astar Surge campaign During the Astar Surge campaign, ASTR holders can deposit their tokens into specially designed contracts on Astar’s Layer-1 (L1) network. By depositing their tokens, holders earn points for each Soneium decentralized application ( dApp ) that they engage with. The points can later be redeemed for new project tokens during token generation events (TGEs). As such, the model gives early adopters an incentive to help boost ecosystem growth and adoption. Maarten Henskens, Head of Astar Foundation, remarked on the platform’s commitment to bringing Web3 solutions to a global audience: “Astar Surge represents a significant milestone in our mission to connect people to Web3 and bring this technology to billions. By empowering our community with early access to groundbreaking Soneium dApps, we’re not only accelerating ecosystem growth but also ensuring a seamless transition to Soneium’s infrastructure.’ Henskens continued: “This collaboration underscores our commitment to driving global adoption of the Astar Network and its representative token, ASTR, creating lasting value for all current and future holders.” Astar’s collaboration with Soneium A number of Soneium projects — such as Yay!, Sake Finance, Untitled Bank, SoneX, and Kyo Finance — are joining working together with Astar to implement pre-deposit contracts. These collaborations are expected to enhance the total value locked (TVL) and give each project more visibility in the period before Soneium’s mainnet launch. The liquidity generated through these contracts will ensure the new infrastructure is sufficiently well-prepared from day one. Astar Network security The contracts used in the campaign are the work of Sake Finance, and they have been audited by PeckShield. Thanks to ERC-6551 token-bound accounts, users will retain ownership of their tokens and keep them in secure contracts until the Soneium mainnet launch. Once ASTR or ASTR liquid staking tokens (LSTs) are deposited, the protocol creates a token-bound smart contract account, which locks the assets but keeps the associated non-fungible token ( NFT ) in the user’s control. Following the mainnet launch, users will unlock their assets by signing transactions and updating bridge contracts via, for example, LayerZero and Chainlink CCIP.

While there are already applications for altcoin ETFs for some altcoins like Solana (SOL) and XRP, BlackRock has closed the door on any other ETFs. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas shared BlackRock ETF president Jay Jacobs' statements on this subject. At this point, Jay Jacobs said that BlackRock will focus on Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs rather than launching other altcoin ETFs. Jacobs said that his exploration of Bitcoin and Ethereum has just begun and that interest in BTC and ETH is just the tip of the iceberg. Noting that Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs currently only reach a small number of customers, the BlakRock manager emphasized that the company is focusing on the BTC and ETH space rather than launching new altcoin ETFs. “We are actually just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Bitcoin and especially Ethereum. Only a very small portion of our clients own IBIT and ETHA, so instead of launching new altcoin ETFs, we will focus on BTC and ETH.” While many investors appreciate BlackRock’s approach of not launching more crypto ETFs, one user said that a step-by-step approach is better when it comes to ETFs, as launching a new ETF too early will only increase volatility.

Experts predict it could surpass major players like Ethereum and Solana. Starting from scratch, this digital asset might rise to millions in value. What makes it so promising? This article delves into why analysts are so optimistic about its future. CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors , positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450% , climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges including Gate.io, and the listing is planned on December 14th. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Ethereum Shows Solid Potential as Bulls Gear Up for a Breakout Ethereum is holding up well, trading between $3643 and $4232.62. The bulls seem to be gathering strength with a recent one-month price increase of over 19%. The nearest resistance is at $4457.83, and breaking this could push prices towards $5047.32, an impressive potential rise of around 20%. Support levels appear solid with the nearest at $3278.87, offering a cushion. Despite a slight dip in the MACD and RSI levels, the positive price trend over the past month signals robust potential. If the pattern continues, Ethereum could be set for significant growth. The market is showing repeat patterns from 2021, fueling optimism for a bullish run. Solana Poised for Growth Despite Short-Term Market Hesitation Solana (SOL) shows a promising pattern akin to 2021’s bullish trends despite a recent dip. Currently trading between $219 and $251, the bulls and bears are in a tug-of-war. With strong support at around $201 and significant resistance at $265, breaking through could push SOL upwards. If it breaches this resistance, it could surge to the $297 level, marking a growth of up to 18%. Over the past six months, SOL has already climbed by 40%, indicating robust long-term growth potential. Keep an eye on these key levels as Solana seems ready for its next big move. Conclusion With the 2024 bull run in full swing, traditional coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) may offer less short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO presents investors with exceptional opportunities to enhance earnings through its AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. Offering lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Its commitment to transparency, compliance, and quality sets it apart as a promising project. The strong interest from crypto whales and influencers underscores CYBRO’s potential to outperform other tokens in the current market.

37586185,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626942,1734094341,China’s Xi Jinping says no to attending Trump’s inauguration. As he should,"China’s President Xi Jinping has declined President Donald Trump’s puzzling invitation to attend his second inauguration on January 20, as we predicted he would. Jinping was never going to show up . The mere thought of the Chinese leader bundled up on the west front of the U.S. Capitol, nodding politely as Trump swore to uphold the Constitution, is frankly laughable. The optics alone would be a nightmare, a direct clash with his image as a strongman steering China to superpower status. Trump’s invitation came with zero political feasibility. But that’s just Trump on a typical Tuesday. However, even he must have known that Jinping appearing to pay homage to the United States and its democratic system would be entirely anathema. This is an authoritarian leader who thrives on crushing individual freedoms. Jinping’s presence would be seen as tacit approval of America’s transfer of power, a concept fundamentally at odds with the Chinese Communist Party’s ideology. Trump’s unserious foreign policy President Trump has always been about dramatic gestures and breaking the mold. This move fits his pattern of tossing out the diplomatic playbook and doing things his way, regardless of tradition. It’s part of his charm. He has also invited other world leaders to the inauguration, in yet another deviation from norms. His goal? To turn the event into a global spectacle. Trump’s foreign policy team is stacked with hawks. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, tapped as Secretary of State, and Representative Mike Waltz, chosen for National Security Advisor, both see China as a multifaceted threat to America — economically, militarily, and technologically. U.S.-China tensions keep rising The backdrop to this latest drama is a U.S.-China relationship that’s spiraling into outright hostility, perhaps thanks in part to Russia’s President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader appears to be close friends with Jinping and has gradually moved away from his cordiality with Trump. Now China and America are at odds on nearly every front. Taiwan remains a flashpoint, with the former considering the island its territory and the latter maintaining strategic ambiguity about defending it. Military tensions are also high, with forces frequently clashing in the South and East China Seas. China isn’t just challenging the U.S. directly, it’s forming alliances with other nations that oppose Western dominance. Russia, Iran, and North Korea are part of an emerging anti-Western axis, with Beijing playing a leading role. In Washington, lawmakers from both parties accuse China of intellectual property theft, breaking trade rules, and attempting to undermine international law. Amid this, Trump’s invitation to Jinping feels contradictory. The president-elect has spent years threatening China with crushing tariffs and accusing Beijing of ripping off America economically. Yet, he has also praised Jinping as “tough” and “smart,” even calling him “my friend.” He gave him a shout-out just yesterday when he rang the Opening Bell on Wall Street. The contradictions were on full display during a recent CNBC interview, where Trump said, “We’ve been talking and discussing with President Jinping… I think we’re going to do very well all around.” Moments later, he added, “We’ve been abused as a country. We’ve been badly abused from an economic standpoint.” But as we’ve explored before, a full-blown trade war would hurt both countries. Higher import prices in the U.S. would strain consumers already grappling with inflation. On the other side of the divide, China could face severe economic vulnerabilities, including industrial overcapacity and weak household demand. Despite these risks, Trump’s friendship with Jinping signaled a willingness to explore new trade deals.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum leads the crypto surge with $500m ETF inflows, Cardano targets $10 amid ecosystem growth, and Yeti Ouro gains momentum as the next viral altcoin. Table of Contents Ethereum ETFs witness record inflows Cardano price targets $10 Yeti Ouro: The viral altcoin to watch What makes Yeti Ouro different? Market outlook: 2024 and beyond Ethereum price continues to shine as it attracts major attention from institutional investors. Over $500 million flowed into Ethereum spot ETFs in recent days, signaling renewed market confidence. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) is targeting a bold move toward the $10 milestone, fueled by its growing ecosystem. Adding to the excitement, the Yeti Ouro (YETIO) presale nears its next price hike, sparking intense interest among investors. Ethereum ETFs witness record inflows Ethereum’s spot ETFs recorded a massive inflow of $500 million, with BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge. The “dramatic turnaround” sentiment for the asset saw year-to-date net inflows reach $2.2 billion — surpassing the prior $2 billion peak set in 2021 with a month to spare. The U.S. spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds led the flows, adding $466.5 million. Ethereum ETF Chart- source: Theblock The funds have attracted more than $1.1 billion in net inflows since the U.S. election, overcoming substantial initial outflows from Grayscale’s converted and higher-fee fund, ETHE, to reach $583.8 million total net inflows, with $11 billion in assets under management. Ethereum’s growing utility as the backbone of DeFi and NFTs further supports its bullish outlook. With major financial institutions backing its growth, ETH seems poised for sustained upward momentum. Cardano price targets $10 Cardano is also making waves in the crypto market. Currently trading around $1.15, ADA is eyeing the $10 target as its ecosystem expands. Recent network upgrades and increased adoption have positioned Cardano as a key competitor to Ethereum. 1-month Cardano price chart- source: CoinMarketCap Similar to Ethereum, Cardano has attracted a great deal of attention from institutional investors, which has led many to hope for its future. Cardano focuses on energy-efficient blockchain solutions, which speaks to socially conscious investors. Analysts see ADA following in the footsteps of Ethereum in its early years. Cardano could be valued at ten times another digital moolah in the coming years if this momentum keeps up. Yeti Ouro: The viral altcoin to watch Yeti Ouro combines the best of both worlds: MemeF1 and DeFi. It’s no wonder that investors see it as a promising asset. Even more groundbreaking than traditional meme coins, its tokenomics, mighty communities, and gaming ecosystem make it different from any other such project. Yeti Ouro could see 10x growth, especially when more investors recognize its potential. Noteworthy about Yeti Ouro is its stacked supply of 1 billion tokens and deflationary burn system. These create scarcity, firming up demand as the token rises. Yeti Ouro has already raised over $1,000,000 in its pre-sale, leaving only 17% of tokens left before the next price increase. What makes Yeti Ouro different? Yeti Ouro is a blend of innovation and practical use and a thrilling option for investors. In Yeti Go, its flagship game, movement is intuitive because the mechanics are smooth, objects are interactive and dynamic, and gameplay is chaotic but compelling. With rich, immersive worlds and playable layouts, all designed to be repeated by the consumer, Yeti Go is positioned as a leader in the P2E field. Yeti Ouro is designed in collaboration with experts from the gaming industry. Besides iconic games such as Call of Duty and The Witcher 3, the Influence of these emerging giants will be Duty and 3 newcomers like YETIO rookie. Its cutting-edge audio design, using Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos Sound, makes for a richly engaging soundscape that gamers have never heard before. Market outlook: 2024 and beyond As the year closes, the crypto market is buzzing with opportunities. Ethereum’s ETF success cements its position as a market leader, while Cardano’s ambitious roadmap continues to attract attention. At the same time, Yeti Ouro’s viral rise offers a chance for early adopters to capitalize on its growing momentum.

Ripple (XRP) is one of the altcoins that has benefitted from the presidential elections; it has regained strength in the market and is currently positioned in fourth place. However, Ripple (XRP) is a large-cap crypto, and replicating the same growth with momentum is difficult. Expert investors are now pouring money into the DTX Exchange (DTX) to capitalize on the bull market, as it can potentially replicate XRP’s gains. We’ll see what factors make the DTX Exchange a better investment opportunity than Ripple. Ripple (XRP) Gets the Go-Ahead from NYDFS for RLUSD Ripple (XRP) CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced on Tuesday that the company received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to launch its stablecoin, RLUSD. This comes after Ripple’s long legal battle with the SEC, which has helped the company thrive in the final months of 2024. RLUSD is currently beta testing on the Ethereum network and XRP Ledger (XRPL), with a circulating supply of $52 million. Ripple (XRP) first introduced RLUSD in April and began beta testing on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum blockchains in August. The stablecoin market is worth nearly $200 billion and is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Ripple (XRP) plans to use RLUSD to boost its presence in global payments and help bridge traditional financial assets to blockchain networks. Courtesy: TradingView After RLUSD's approval, XRP formed an immediate reversal on the charts, pushing the price above $2.30. It has formed a bullish hammer candle showing buying from the demand area. Currently, Ripple (XRP) is trading above its multiyear high of $2, and with this news, bulls can again take over, forming a reversal pattern on the charts. DTX Exchange Storms Up With $10 Million Presale Milestone Major cryptocurrencies like Ripple (XRP) have faced bearish pressure due to market volatility; however, even in this slump, DTX Exchange (DTX) has continued its momentum, reaching the $10 million mark in its token presale. This unique trading platform has expanded its user base to 730K, quickly improving its ecosystem with the rapid developments. DTX’s robust infrastructure, which provides users with an ideal DeFi platform, has contributed to its success. DTX Exchange is known for pioneering capabilities in the hybrid exchange space, which allows users to gain exposure to CEX and DEX in a single unified platform. Trading features like multi-asset trading, 1,000x leverage, and AI automation are the exchange's highlights and main attractions for experienced traders. DTX Exchange is fully prepared to outperform its competitors with a revolutionary trading stance. Discounted Price and Community Focus Fuel Rising Demand on DTX Exchange Community is one of the core foundations of any crypto project, and DTX Exchange provides various features for community members. With the VIP Rebate program, DTX community members can generate passive income. Also, with the staking features, token holders can earn up to 36% APY, which is well above industry standards. Another major reason for increased demand in the presale is the undervalued DTX tokens available at $0.12. Token holders will get additional perks like reduced trading fees and priority access to DTX airdrops. According to experts, DTX can rise to $24 in 2025, allowing 200X gains. If an investor puts $100 in the presale at current levels, this investment could be worth $20,100 when the token hits the target.

This figure eclipses the combined inflows of 10 other major exchanges, including Bybit at $8.2 billion and OKX at $5.3 billion. Binance attributes this surge to several market catalysts, including regulatory progress, landmark Bitcoin price rallies, and the introduction of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in key regions. The exchange highlighted these milestones as instrumental in growing its user base to nearly 250 million globally . In contrast, exchanges like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, and Crypto.com have faced significant outflows, with figures reaching $2.75 billion, $1.77 billion, and $358.1 million, respectively. DefiLlama clarified that its dataset excludes platforms such as Coinbase and Gemini due to their lack of wallet transparency. Institutional Capital Boosts Growth Institutional investors have played a crucial role in Binance’s success this year. According to CryptoQuant, the average Bitcoin deposit size on Binance grew from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC, while USDt (Tether) deposits skyrocketed from $19,600 to $230,000. This influx of large-scale deposits underscores the growing confidence of institutional players in Binance’s ecosystem. The platform also achieved a groundbreaking milestone, becoming the first centralized exchange (CEX) to surpass $100 trillion in lifetime trading volume, as reported by CCData. In comparison, OKX trails with a cumulative trading volume of $25 trillion. Despite expectations of a shift toward decentralized exchanges (DEXs) following the FTX collapse in November 2022 , centralized platforms continue to dominate. Data from CoinGecko reveals that CEXs accounted for $276 billion in trading volume within a 24-hour window, while DEXs managed just $28.5 billion during the same period. A Year of Unprecedented Surge for Binance As the cryptocurrency industry matures, Binance has emerged as a focal point for retail and institutional investors alike. Its ability to attract significant inflows and achieve record-breaking trading volumes signals not only the platform’s resilience but also the broader adoption of digital assets. While competitors face challenges and decentralized platforms vie for market share, Binance’s regulatory advances, robust infrastructure, and growing institutional presence position it as the enduring leader in the crypto exchange landscape.

37585983,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392768,1734094049,Ripple CTO Reveals Shocking Truth About XRP Burning Process,"The post Ripple CTO Reveals Shocking Truth About XRP Burning Process appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The XRP community on X (formerly Twitter) has been actively discussing the burning mechanism of XRP, especially in relation to RLUSD tokens. A user recently asked, “What happens when trillions of RLUSD tokens move daily on the XRP Ledger? Does XRP get burned during these transactions?” Ripple CTO David Schwartz stepped in to clarify how XRP burning works and what it means for both XRP and RLUSD. What Is XRP Burning, and How Does It Work? David Schwartz explained that XRP’s burning mechanism is a key feature of the XRP Ledger, designed to keep the network efficient and secure. Each transaction, whether for XRP or RLUSD, incurs a small fee in XRP. Unlike conventional fees that are redistributed, this fee is permanently removed—or “burned”—from circulation. The minimum is set by consensus. But if there's a burst of transaction load beyond what the network can clear, transactions are prioritized based on fees. — David ""JoelKatz"" Schwartz (@JoelKatz) December 13, 2024 The amount burned per transaction is tiny, typically around 0.00001 XRP , but over time, these small burns reduce the total supply of XRP. How Much XRP Is Burned Over Time? Schwartz pointed out that even with a significant increase in transactions, the impact on XRP’s total supply remains minimal. For instance, if payment systems like SWIFT, Visa, and Mastercard adopted XRP for billions of transactions daily, the annual burn would account for just 0.0075% of XRP’s supply. This highlights that while XRP burning gradually reduces the supply, it doesn’t lead to drastic changes in the short term. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP ETF to Launch Soon? Odds Increase After Grayscale Trust Jumps 300% , RLUSD Transactions Also Burn XRP Ripple’s RLUSD, a stablecoin built on the XRP Ledger, follows the same fee-burning system. Although RLUSD is a separate asset, every RLUSD transaction also results in a small amount of XRP being burned. This means that increased use of RLUSD could lead to a gradual decrease in XRP’s total supply. However, Schwartz emphasized that the effect on XRP’s supply remains modest, even with high transaction volumes. Importantly, this mechanism helps the network stay efficient by discouraging spam transactions and ensuring faster processing of critical ones. Future of XRPL Ripple is preparing to launch RLUSD , which could play a key role in the growing stablecoin market, expected to reach $2.3 trillion . While RLUSD transactions will contribute to XRP burning, the overall impact on supply will be small yet consistent. The combination of XRP burning and RLUSD adoption is expected to have long-term effects on the XRP Ledger’s economy. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Turbo (TURBO) Turbo (TURBO) has been exhibiting impressive price movement recently. Over the past week, the price has surged by over 70%, and in the past month, it has increased by more than 40%. The current price range stands between $0.0080170 and $0.01318. The simple moving averages indicate a bullish trend, with the 10-day SMA at $0.01276 and the 100-day SMA at $0.01124. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 65.36, suggesting that the coin is approaching overbought territory, but there’s still room for growth. If the bullish momentum continues, Turbo could test the nearest resistance level at $0.01517. Breaking through this level might pave the way towards the second resistance at $0.02033, representing a significant percentage increase from the current prices. The MACD level of 0.0007404 supports the positive outlook. However, traders should also be aware of the nearest support at $0.004844, which could act as a safety net in case of price corrections. With a six-month price change of over 178%, Turbo is showing potential for further growth amid the anticipated altcoin season. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been showing signs of strength lately, trading between $0.00002805 and $0.00003489. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 63.90 suggests that buying interest remains strong. The closeness of the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages, at $0.00002812 and $0.00002941 respectively, indicates a potential upward trend forming. With the bulls gaining traction, SHIB could soon test the nearest resistance level at $0.00003759. Surpassing this point may lead the price toward the second resistance at $0.00004442, which would be an increase of over 20% from current levels. Over the past month, SHIB has increased by around 10%, and over six months, it has risen by approximately 35%. These gains highlight SHIB’s potential for significant growth in the anticipated altcoin season. Conclusion Despite strong performances by TURBO and SHIB, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the pioneering all-sport memecoin, uniting fans and targeting massive growth as a cultural icon.

37585919,https://dailyhodl.com/?p=312619,1734093916,Texas Lawmaker Introduces Bill That Would Establish Bitcoin Reserve Within the State Treasury,"A member of the Texas House of Representatives just proposed a new legislation that will enable the Lone Star State to establish a strategic Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve within its treasury. Republican state Representative Giovanni Capriglione filed the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act on Thursday. The bill says the strategic Bitcoin reserve aligns with the state’s commitment to fostering innovation in digital assets and enhancing financial security as the flagship cryptocurrency can serve as a hedge against inflation and economic volatility. If approved, the proposed law will allow Texas residents to voluntarily contribute to the reserve gifts, grants, donations, bequests or devises in BTC. Bitcoin that enters the state’s custody needs to be stored for a minimum of five years before the asset may be transferred, sold, or converted to another crypto asset. “This fund allows the state to own Bitcoin as a financial asset and for Texans to voluntarily donate Bitcoin to promote a shared ownership and community investment in Texas’s financial future.” Says Dennis Porter, the CEO and co-founder of crypto-focused nonprofit Satoshi Action Fund, “I can confirm that the state of Texas has filed a bill to officially establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’.

XRP (XRP) is showing a double top pattern, suggesting a probable breakout while Dogecoin (DOGE) is testing significant support levels ready for a potential rise. DTX Exchange has meanwhile created an innovative VIP Rebate System to appeal to both new and seasoned traders. What do these occurrences signify for those seeking financial gain from the next significant crypto revolution? Discover why professionals find these assets exciting and how DTX Exchange is becoming a crypto game-changer by reading on.

Tight compliance and a good SOLIDProof audit help the platform to be dedicated to security and give investors peace of mind knowing their digital assets are in qualified hands. By pre-listing the DTX token on CoinMarketCap, DTX Exchange's growing reputation among crypto traders is strengthened, therefore boosting its credibility. The platform's unique VIP Rebate System, which helps users become exclusive partners and earn up to 3% of daily trading profits, appeals also to both novice and experienced investors. The DTX Exchange platform offers a fantastic chance for investors to join the presale before the expected 30x increase in value post-presale, given the DTX token valued at just $0.12 in the sixth presale round. Soon accessible on both Google Play Store and Apple Store, DTX's Phoenix Wallet gives users the freedom to handle their transactions on-demand, therefore improving the user experience of the platform. XRP (XRP) Shows Potential For Further Rallies With an amazing 270% surge over the past month, the XRP coin has become one of the most promising altcoins to watch. The consolidation of the XRP price between $2.9 and $2.1 points to a stable phase that will help to prepare the ground for its next possible surge. Although the double-top pattern developed follows a new 2024 high of $2.8, generally the trend remains positive. Although the XRP price plunged 16% last week, its bullish momentum and excellent technical indicators—which include positive signals from the MACD and moving averages, indicating to tempting purchasing prospects—continue to enthrall investors. Analysts predict that by next year the XRP coin could be worth $10. Moreover, the general attitude of the community regarding XRP (XRP) is still relatively positive. XRP (XRP) is one of the top crypto coins in the market even if it presently trades almost 40% behind its ATH of $3.84. XRP (XRP) is a promising altcoin for investors looking for long-term gains because of its continuous positive momentum and strong market fundamentals. Dogecoin (DOGE) Set for Breakout Rising by 75% over the previous month, the Dogecoin price has had an amazing bullish run that peaked at $0.48. Staying within the limited band of $0.39 to $0.49, the Dogecoin price shows a great degree of steadiness despite small fluctuations. Though Dogecoin (DOGE) has retested the significant $0.40 support zone under recent negative pressure, overall opinion about the altcoin is still positive. Strong indications indicate to the altcoin perhaps breaching the $0.50 resistance level, hence allowing greater gains with a double-bottom pattern developing on the Dogecoin price chart. Investors are closely looking at Dogecoin (DOGE) because of its 10.75% price volatility and outstanding 63% of green days over the past 30 days, which signal to continued positive momentum. With price projections for 2025 ranging between $0.37 and $1.12, Dogecoin (DOGE) is viewed as one of the promising altcoins to watch for long-term development ahead. Technical signals including the MACD and Moving Averages show buy signals on the Dogecoin price chart, so supporting the altcoin's ranking as one of the top crypto coins to buy this quarter. DTX Exchange Attracts XRP and Dogecoin Investors Investors are not ignoring another game-changing initiative even though XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE) show great promise for additional expansion. DTX Exchange is preparing to be the next best platform for cryptocurrency traders with lightning-fast execution speeds and unsurpassed security. Along with the rising demand for the DTX token, the launch of its VIP Rebate System helps the exchange to be a top choice for individuals looking for large returns.

37585912,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52055,1734093793,Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) Triple-Digit Gains About to be Overshadowed as $0.125 Token Readies a Mega Pump to $10,"With their triple-digit growth, tokens, including Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) have regularly drawn the interest of investors. But a fresh contender with a convincing value proposition and unheard-of development potential is taking the front stage: Rexas Finance (RXS). Rexas Finance is currently trading at $0.125 in its ninth presale round, RXS has already increased 320% from its $0.030 initial price to generate $24.75 million. Rexas Finance might shortly eclipse the gains of DOGE and XRP, establishing itself as a force in the crypto market with the token aiming at a launch price of $0.20 and forecasts of a parabolic increase to $10. Real-world asset tokenization: Unique proposition of Rexas Finance Through its emphasis on Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization, Rexas Finance is transforming our perspective on asset ownership. Using blockchain technology, the platform lets consumers tokenize valuable assets such as real estate, gold, and art. This creative concept democratizes access to once-restricted investing possibilities by allowing fractional and total ownership of assets. The size of the markets Rexas Finance is aiming at emphasizes their great possibilities: Valued at an amazing $379.7 trillion, real estate. Gold: Reflecting a $121.2 trillion industry. Art: At $65 billion yearly trading volume. Rexas Finance is opening trillion-dollar sectors to worldwide involvement by enabling anybody to invest in or tokenize these assets without technical knowledge. The platform’s Launchpad and Token Builder Tool streamline the process, therefore tackling the complexity that often discourages people and companies from investigating tokenization. The presale performance of Rexas Finance demonstrates rising investor hope in its possibilities. Presale sales of 321,914,000 RXS coins thus far have produced $24.75 million in funding. The presale is almost over, and the chance to buy RXS at the price of $0.125 is closing quickly. Over several presale phases, this increasing momentum has been constant: Stage 1 started at $0.030; RXS has subsequently climbed 320%. Presale stage 9 is now under progress; the final launch price is set at $0.20. Early entry is essential for investors trying to maximize returns since the token should rise by another 60% as the presale unfolds. Based on its presale price, analysts estimate that RXS might reach $10 post-launch—a remarkable 8,000% increase. Why Is Rexas Finance Different? Rexas Finance sets itself apart from other cryptocurrencies with its mix of openness, security, and actual use. Simplifying the tokenization process allows Rexas Finance to provide worldwide investors with access to rich markets such as real estate and gold. This accessibility changes everything for people and companies. Rexas Finance has given security first priority in the crypto field because it is so important. This is shown by a thorough audit by CertiK, a top blockchain security company. This guarantees the platform’s dependability and improves its attractiveness to institutional and ordinary investors. Thanks to recent listings on CoinMarketCap (CMC) and CoinGecko, Rexas Finance has become somewhat well-known, enabling investors to monitor its development and interact with the project more precisely. Rexas Finance is organizing a $1 million contest with 20 winners scheduled to get $50,000 worth of RXS each, hence increasing interest. Having over 360,000 entries thus far, this project has increased community involvement and motivated additional attendees to the presale. Outstanding Ripple and Dogecoin Although Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP) are already household names in cryptocurrencies, their long-term value is limited by their dependency on market mood. For example, social media trends and meme culture greatly impact DOGE; XRP mostly serves institutional cross-border payments. Rexas Finance, on the other hand, provides a strong real-world application that, by asset tokenization, solves important inefficiencies in conventional finance. This utility-based strategy distinguishes RXS from other investment options driven by sustainability and positions it as such when compared to speculative assets like DOGE. In the next few months, RXS is expected to produce returns that could surpass those of DOGE and XRP, therefore transforming asset ownership. How might one take part in the RXS Presale? Investing in Rexas Finance during its presale is easy and presents a special chance to enter the market before its official release: Get Ready Your Wallet: Choose a Wallet Connect-compatible wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Fund Your Wallet: Get ETH or USDT to pay for the token purchase plus related petrol costs. Get connected to the DApp: Go to the presale page by first visiting rexas.com. Buy RXS. Choose ETH or USDT as your preferred payment method; verify the transaction and protect your tokens. Add RXS to your wallet. Track your investment with the given coin specifics. Conclusion Using the guidelines of asset ownership, Rexas Finance presents a creative platform combining trillion-dollar markets with blockchain technologies. Its legitimacy and future for expansion are shown by its presale success, CertiK audit, and recent listings on main marketplaces. There is a clear chance for significant gains as the token approaches its $0.20 launch price and beyond. Those who see the promise in RXS could profit from gains much above those of Dogecoin and Ripple. Rexas Finance offers a special chance to participate in a project that might influence asset tokenization going forward with a price of $0.125 and forecasts of reaching $10. Get ready right now to secure your place and start the revolution.

37586352,https://invezz.com/?p=2386519,1734093483,Bank of England asks businesses to disclose current and future crypto exposure,"Businesses in the United Kingdom holding Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies on their balance sheets will be required to disclose their exposure according to a new mandate. On December 13, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the regulatory arm of the Bank of England , issued a statement urging businesses operating under its jurisdiction to disclose their existing and future “crypto asset exposure.” Additionally, businesses must also detail how they are adopting and implementing the “Basel framework for the prudential treatment of crypto assets.” The Basel framework is a set of international standards developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global financial regulator. The prudential treatment of crypto assets framework, introduced in late 2022, offers guidelines on how banks and financial institutions handle cryptocurrencies. According to the PRA, the additional information will help “calibrate [their] prudential treatment of crypto asset exposures” by offering a clearer understanding of how firms engage with crypto assets. This will enable the Bank of England and the PRA to “analyse the relative costs and benefits of different policy options,” ensuring that regulatory measures strike the right balance between fostering innovation and mitigating risks. Monitoring current and planned crypto-related activities up to September 30, 2029, is part of the PRA’s efforts to establish a “base from which to monitor the financial stability implications of these assets.” Per the questionnaire, the PRA recognizes both the potential benefits and significant risks of crypto assets, particularly those using permissionless blockchains, which pose challenges like settlement failures and weak ownership links. Businesses will need to disclose their current and planned crypto asset exposures, including details about tokenised assets, stablecoins, and unbacked cryptocurrencies, by classifying these exposures according to Basel’s risk-based groupings and providing information on their use of permissionless blockchains. Bitcoin’s growing role as a treasury asset Across the globe, businesses are increasingly viewing Bitcoin as a viable asset to hold value, a phenomenon accelerated in recent months as BTC’s price surpassed $100,000. What began as a leap of faith taken by United States-based business intelligence firm MicroStrategy has now become a widespread trend. In recent months, other US-based companies like Anixa Biosciences and Hoth Therapeutics have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. On November 26, Jiva Technologies, an e-commerce brand focused on wellness, revealed it would allocate up to $1 million to add Bitcoin to its treasury, citing its potential as an inflation hedge. Elsewhere, Japanese firms like Metaplanet and Remix Point have already acquired notable amounts of the benchmark asset. Chinese-based interactive gaming company Boyaa was one of the biggest names that increased its Bitcoin exposure by swapping some of its Ethereum holdings. Notably, the company added 515 Bitcoin to its existing stash earlier this month.

Solana bulls rally around its high-speed blockchain and vast ecosystem, heightening competition and leaving investors wondering if SOL will triumph. Rexas Finance (RXS) enters this fierce battle with innovative real-world asset (RWA) tokenization technologies. RXS is drawing investors searching for the next big thing by promising to transform asset ownership and trading. Rexas Finance may challenge SOL and XRP’s market supremacy. There will be a spectacular cryptocurrency showdown. Surging to Take Charge Of the Market Long known for its scalable blockchain and fast transaction rates, Solana is a cryptocurrency powerhouse. Its high throughput and cheap transaction fees have made it a growth engine in the non-fungible token (NFT) and decentralized finance (DeFi) industries, drawing developers and consumers seeking efficiency and innovation. New ecosystem updates have improved its reputation, enabling easy project integration and increasing acceptance. Recent SOL value increases indicate increased investor confidence. Despite these results, Solana’s high trading price—currently over $228.1—makes investing difficult for small investors. Its premium valuation highlights its success and stability but limits exponential returns, pushing value-driven investors to consider alternatives with lower entry prices and higher growth potential. To remain a market leader, Solana must balance its high-value position with accessibility issues. Maintaining Market Stance against Solana Despite Solana’s market presence, Ripple uses its enterprise-grade solutions and strategic improvements to stay relevant in the fast-changing crypto world. The debut of Ripple’s dollar-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, will change its footprint in the U.S. digital asset market. Assuming NYDFS certification, RLUSD will launch under a defined regulatory framework, offering parity with the U.S. Dollar and a reliable conduit for institutional and retail payments. Unlike XRP, RLUSD’s consistent value offer attracts risk-averse investors and businesses seeking secure transactions. This expands Ripple’s product offerings and boosts its appeal in the stablecoin market, establishing it as a comprehensive blockchain-based financial solutions provider. RLUSD expectation has restored interest in XRP, boosting its price to $2.53, an 85% rise in seven days, and fueling optimism for an all-time high. Ripple’s capacity to adapt and evolve keeps it relevant and makes it a strong competitor against Solana’s bullish momentum. Rexas Finance (RXS): A New Market To Consider Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly becoming an attractive altcoin to Solana and Ripple, offering accessibility, innovation, and development potential to a diversified investor base. During Stage 9 of its presale, RXS was priced at $0.125, making it an affordable entry point for budget-conscious investors looking to capitalize on the next significant cryptocurrency market opportunity. Raising over $25.2 million from selling 326 million RXS tokens during the presale, demonstrating investors’ faith in its long-term ambition. Listings on recognized platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko boost its visibility and legitimacy. Rexas Finance’s focus on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization opens up new asset ownership and trading opportunities beyond these milestones. RXS could outperform Solana and Ripple shortly due to its creative strategy to democratize access to illiquid markets and position it as a revolutionary force in the crypto world. YouTube: https://youtu.be/c0Taufk8uSg?si=6rz6hSavVxogcL7J Rexas Finance (RXS): Turning the Table For A Better Investment Option Rexas Finance is quickly becoming a crypto investing game-changer, competing with Solana and Ripple. Its $1 million giveaway campaign, which is set to give 20 winners $50,000 in RXS tokens , has garnered notice having over 436,000 entries. This project generates awareness and community loyalty, demonstrating a dedication to diversity and sustainable growth. Rexas Finance promotes long-term value development by rewarding its supporters and encouraging new investments. Its community-driven approach distinguishes it from competitors, attracting active and motivated investors who want to transform asset tokenization. Rexas Finance’s $0.125 presale pricing gives it an investing edge over Solana’s $228.1 Ripple’s $2.56 trading price on top of its community-building activities. Investors can build significant RXS holdings at this low entry point, maximizing their rewards as the coin appreciates. Rexas Finance emphasizes results with a projected $0.2 listing on three tier-one exchanges, a 60% gain for early investors. Its utility-driven ecosystem, which uses tokenization to transform industries like real estate, makes RXS a practical and forward-thinking asset. Rexas Finance offers a clear path to real-world effect and ongoing growth, unlike Solana, which attracts speculative investors, or Ripple, which competes in stablecoin and cross-border payments industries. RXS stands out for investors seeking disruptive crypto market potential because of its community, affordability, and utility.

Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the legislation at a time when BTC is attracting significant attention. Texas To Establish Bitcoin Reserve? The Texas House of Representatives introduced legislation to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, a move that mirrors efforts on the national level. The proposed bill, H.B. No. 1598, was introduced by Texas State Representative Giovanni Capriglione and aims to build a strategic supply of Bitcoin (BTC) for the state with funds held for at least five years without being sold. Citizens will also be allowed to donate to the fund. The bill states, “A strategic Bitcoin reserve aligns with Texas’s commitment to fostering innovation in digital assets and providing Texans with enhanced financial security.” The bill also states that cryptocurrency stored in cold wallets will not be used to make transactions outside of the state or abroad. “The comptroller shall prohibit transactions involving foreign countries, entities or individuals outside of Texas, or entities or individuals known to engage in illegal activities.” Dennis Porter, the founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, confirmed the bill had been introduced in an X space. Texas is one of ten states exploring creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Porter believes the passing of legislation at the state level is key for establishing a federal Bitcoin reserve. “I can confirm that the state of Texas has filed a bill to officially establish a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’. History was made as this was the first time a bill was filed live on X Spaces. Congrats to @VoteGiovanni for his leadership on Bitcoin.” A Long-Standing Idea Capriglione stated on a Spaces live event that he toyed with the idea for a considerable amount of time, discussing it with members and educating them about Bitcoin. “We’ve slowly planted the seeds and planted the education for members. Probably the biggest enemy of our investments is inflation. A strategic bitcoin reserve, investing in bitcoin, would be a win-win for the state.” Texas is the second-largest economy in the US and the eighth-largest globally. It also has the highest concentration of Bitcoin miners. Capriglione hopes some of them will begin paying their taxes in crypto. The current proposal does not include a direct Bitcoin purchasing strategy. The Texas Representative added, “My goal is to make this bill as big and as broad as possible. This initial step is to allow some optionality and flexibility on it, but if I can get support from other legislators, we will make it even stronger.” Will The US Establish A Bitcoin Reserve? However, there is some doubt about the US establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. If it does, it is unclear if it will be the first. Either way, the idea could act as a positive market catalyst and drive other countries to establish their reserve, irrespective of whether the US does so or not. Needham’s John Todaro stated, “It’s unlikely to occur, but it helps get animal spirits back into the market. It’s also unlikely to drive material price gains, as we do not expect the U.S. government will purchase bitcoin in any meaningful capacity, but it’s an item that drives excitement and optimism.” Other States Exploring The Idea Several other states are also exploring a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Pennsylvania introduced a strategic Bitcoin reserve bill in November, and discussions are ongoing in at least ten states to introduce similar legislation. Porter, who worked with Capriglione on the Texas draft bill, is also assisting lawmakers in Louisiana, Arkansas, Montana, and Oklahoma, with similar legislation.

Whether it was because of the massive support from the community or the appreciation of prices during the bull market, this is the only reason it belongs to the sphere of highly speculative and risky assets. Still, it also has huge profit potential if the tokens rely on past trends. Should it cross your mind to put your money into Shiba Inu in eagerness to get the returns and use them to retire, it is important to note its possibilities and the risks it carries. At the current price of $0.00003218 as of this writing, if SHIB were to elevate its value to $0.01 and you had 100 million SHIB tokens, that would, in turn, equate to 1 million dollars. In other words, if you purchased SHIB for just $1000 and the price reached a decent target, you might expect to be a millionaire, but even this statement seems impractical. Despite Shiba Inu's promise, there are better cryptocurrencies in the market whose fundamentals are more robust and whose tokenomics are more convincing. These assets are beneficial for speculation and come with a great mix of newness and practicality that could aid in healthy and long-term development. The following options provide a greater hope in this market cycle in comparison to Shiba Inu: Rexas Finance (RXS), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polkadot (DOT) Rexas Finance (RXS) Rexas Finance (RXS) is one of the most promising and upcoming projects in the crypto ecosystem as it aims at Real World Assets RWA tokenization of land. Unlike SHIB, which is mainly community-based, RXS poses actual real-world value in the blockchain ecosystem. With a current valuation of $0.20, RXS is a very good entry-level investment. Analysts are forecasting RXS to reach up to $50 in a couple of years, suggesting that an individual investment of $4,000 today could go as high as $1,000,000. This appreciation in value is bound to occur as a result of Rexas Finances' recent technologies incorporating the QuickMint Bot, which enables easy acquisition of assets to people through tokenization, and the Rexas Treasury, which is an AI-Multi Chain Yield Optimiser. These differentiations make Rexas a strong competitor to tokens like SHIB, operating on speculative terms, enabling one who intends to become wealthy within the next cycle to diversify. Avalanche (AVAX) With its groundbreaking consensus protocols, Avalaunch will definitely be one of the blockchain's future saviors, thus making it a great investment for anyone looking for long-term wealth. As the DeFi landscape continues to mature and as many more developers join the platform, we expect the demand for AVAX tokens to increase. Besides its capped tokenomics, which stands at 720 million tokens, paired with a robust ecosystem and rising adoption, Avalanche looks ready to appreciate aggressively in the coming years. Many analysts are optimistic that AVAX could appreciate its current value by two or three times in the next bull run, which is a good indicator for traders searching for more robust, economically sound factors. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot is currently priced at $10.53, and its market cap is around $16.7 billion. This product continues to appreciate due to its dependence on usage and does not tend to depreciate. By conducting parachain auctions, Polkadot enables developers to create self-sufficient free-standing blockchains that can be plugged into the network and expanded. The growth polkadot price prediction for 2030 also suggests it will rise to the growing number of needs for various offerings throughout the blockchain ecosystem since it will serve as one of the key, if not the key, layers of the platform. Considering the market has matured to a structure of long-term investments, DOT is superior to extremely speculative tokens like Shiba Inu. Conclusion Although Shiba Inu has some potential for being a speculation target, its speculative nature and tokenomics barriers do not make it an ideal asset for someone aiming to retire wealthy. On the other hand, tokenized assets such as Rexus Finance (RXS), Avalanche (AVAX), and Polkadot (DOT) have the potential to thrive because of their real-world usage and the technology behind them. These substitutes offer a better return on investment method for overseas individual and institutional investors seeking transformational returns. With billions of dollars being pumped into blockchain technology every year, looking into these projects is one of the best options for maintaining and eventually growing one's wealth.

After breaching $100k recently, it is expected that the biggest crypto might hit $160k by 2025. The massive 136% Year-to-date (YTD) surge for BTC has been driven by institutional adoption, increasing use cases, and growing regulatory clarity. The global crypto market has seen Bitcoin regain the spotlight after Donald Trump’s US presidential election win. BTC price has soared by over 55% in the last 30 days while its supremacy grew to 55.21%. The cumulative digital assets market cap is hovering around the $3.6 trillion mark. Matrixport sees Bitcoin at $160K According to the Matrixport report , BTC price is expected to reach $160,000 in 2025, which is still a 60% upward run from current market conditions. This target comes with projections of sustained demand for Bitcoin ETFs, macroeconomic shifts, and global liquidity expansion. Its analysis recommends a 1.55% allocation for optimal diversification and portfolio stability. The report mentioned that adoption is nearing a critical threshold and Bitcoin could cross the 8% global adoption mark by 2025. Recently, BlackRock advised limiting BTC to 2% of a multi-asset portfolio by citing its volatility. The world’s largest asset manager suggests that this allotment is needed to balance risk akin to tech stocks in a classic 60/40 portfolio. The report mentioned that the market dynamics have changed as there are not many chances of 80% drawdowns based on increased institutional involvement and strong surges in dip buying activity. While corrections remain natural, they are expected to be less severe. Indicators like the Greed and Fear Index show a shorter consolidation phase. This comes with normalized funding rates and stabilizing markets. As of now, the index is at “Extreme Greed.” BTC is trading at an average price of $100,474 as of press time. Trump’s crypto plan President-elect Donald Trump has already outlined his plans for the US to become the global leader in crypto. In a recent interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer, Trump stated, “We’re gonna do something great with crypto.” He also stressed the importance of staying ahead of international competitors like China. The creation of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve is one of the bold declarations Trump made during his campaign. The move would undoubtedly solidify the country’s role in the crypto ecosystem. Meanwhile, his venture into the crypto sector and collaboration with billionaire Steve Witkoff has raised ethical concerns. The most recent is its partnership with the Tron platform, which has the infamous reputation as the preferred platform for terror groups and criminal activities. Data show that Trump’s World Liberty has bought another 37,052 LINK(approximately worth $1 million) at $27 and 685 AAVE (approximately worth $246.7K) at $360. The organization has also been reported to spent $30 million USDC to buy 8,105 Ether and $10 million USDC to add 103 cbBTC since November 30.

Toncoin has been grappling with increased market volatility, while Near Protocol continues to trend for its promising gains. But all eyes are on Qubetics , which has just smashed through its 12th presale stage, raising over $5.7 million. So, why is Qubetics stealing the spotlight? Beyond the hype, it’s addressing some of crypto’s biggest challenges, such as illiquidity and lack of transparency in tokenised marketplaces. Let’s dive into why Qubetics and its competitors, Toncoin and Near Protocol, are being touted as the Best Altcoins with 100x Potential. Qubetics: Solving Real Problems with Real Innovations When it comes to innovation, Qubetics ($TICS) is setting the bar high. Its mission? To revolutionise the concept of tokenised marketplaces by tackling challenges like illiquidity, high-value investment barriers, and regulatory compliance. Traditional marketplaces often leave investors in the lurch with limited liquidity and murky transparency. Enter Qubetics, which leverages blockchain tech to make tokenised assets accessible to everyone, not just institutional giants. Imagine investing $1,000 into Qubetics at its current presale price of $0.0311. With analysts predicting a price jump to $10-$15 post-mainnet, your initial stake could potentially balloon to $300,000. Talk about a life-changing opportunity! For more information on how Qubetics is transforming the crypto world, watch this video . Numbers Don’t Lie Qubetics is making waves with its impressive stats: Over $5.7 million raised 313 million tokens sold More than 8,700 holders already onboard If you’re looking for a project with solid fundamentals and a killer roadmap, Qubetics might just be your ticket to the big leagues. In a sea of altcoins, why is Qubetics turning heads? The answer lies in its ability to solve real-world problems while offering massive growth potential. Qubetics goes beyond just creating a tokenised marketplace; it also prioritises security and compliance, two areas where many projects fall short. This ensures that your investments remain safe in a volatile market. With over 8,700 token holders already on board, Qubetics isn’t just a project—it’s a movement. Its community-driven approach is paving the way for a decentralised future that truly puts users first. Toncoin: Battling Volatility But Still Worth Watching Toncoin ($TON) has had a rough week, with its wallet profitability dipping amidst market turbulence. The Toncoin network, built on Telegram’s Open Network, offers a unique approach to decentralised applications and smart contracts. While its recent struggles are noteworthy, Toncoin’s core tech remains solid. It’s a coin that appeals to developers and projects seeking scalable blockchain solutions. If you’re after a longer-term investment, Toncoin’s potential shouldn’t be written off just yet. But let’s be real—can it compete with the momentum Qubetics is building? Near Protocol: The DeFi Giant in the Making Near Protocol ($NEAR) is another strong contender in the altcoin space. Its focus on user-friendly blockchain solutions has earned it a top spot among decentralised finance (DeFi) enthusiasts. Recent analysis highlights Near Protocol’s scalability and low transaction costs as game-changers. And with predictions of over 40,000% gains for early investors, it’s no surprise that $NEAR is trending across crypto forums. However, even with its strengths, Near Protocol still faces challenges in bridging the gap between user adoption and market innovation—something Qubetics seems to be acing. Conclusion Qubetics isn’t just another altcoin; it’s a revolution in the making. Its ability to address real-world challenges while offering staggering returns makes it a top contender for the Best Altcoins with 100x Potential. With its 12th stage presale nearing completion and $TICS poised for a massive price surge, the time to act is now. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers—join the Qubetics presale today and be part of the future of tokenised marketplaces.

37590059,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=104988,1734093014,Here is Good Sign an XRP ETF is Coming: Bitboy,"BitBoy predicts an imminent XRP ETF launch, citing the explosive performance of an XRP Trust by a billion-dollar asset manager as a positive sign. ETFs have arguably been the biggest crypto narrative in 2024 besides memes. Fueled by the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs and their impact on the asset's price, market speculators have set their eyes firmly on altcoins they expect to be next in line to receive the traditional investment wrapper. Among the potential contenders is XRP .Recently, a prominent market commentator has offered speculators an additional reason to anticipate the launch of an XRP ETF .""Good Sign XRP ETF Is Coming""On Friday, December 13, Ben ""BitBoy"" Armstrong expressed confidence that an XRP ETF launch was imminent. The influencer shared this view, citing gains recorded by Grayscale's XRP Trust, launched in September 2024 . Specifically, the trust's share price has surged over 300% from an opening price of $10.85 to $47.48 at the time of writing. ""Good sign an XRP ETF is coming,"" Armstrong asserted, citing these gains. Chart of Grayscale's XRP Trust performance since launch. Source: Grayscale Armstrong's sentiment comes as the gains recorded by Grayscale's product could bolster institutional investor confidence in the asset, adding to the factors driving the push for a launch of a spot XRP ETF.Other factors include the SEC's expected pro-crypto shift in the incoming Donald Trump Administration and Ripple's partial win over the regulator in July 2023 in the long-standing case over XRP's asset classification. For context, the Jay Clayton-led SEC in December 2020 had labeled Ripple's XRP sales as unregistered securities offerings. This stance was maintained after Gary Gensler took over the reins at the SEC in 2021, leading to a legal battle that has spanned four years. In July 2023, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP as an asset and its secondary sales did not represent unregistered securities, offering it some legal clarity.So, When Could XRP ETF Launch?Typically, the SEC has 240 days to respond to an ETF application. With the most recent XRP ETF application coming in November 2024, XRP holders could be looking at an approval timeline that extends to July 2025 in the best-case scenario.Still, analysts like Bloomberg's James Seyffart have noted that altcoin ETF approvals could take a bit longer than some expected. Seyffart argues that these assets may need an established Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulated futures market first.At least four asset managers have applied to launch spot XRP ETFs in recent months. These asset managers include Canary Capital, 21 Shares, Bitwise, and Wisdom Tree.",POSITIVE,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/13/here-is-good-sign-an-xrp-etf-is-coming-bitboy/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-good-sign-an-xrp-etf-is-coming-bitboy,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

37590058,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=105038,1734092877,Top Analyst Says Cardano $500B Market Cap with $14 Price Possible,"Widely followed market commentator Dan Gambardello reveals an insanely bullish projection for Cardano (ADA) in the upcoming bull market, predicting an 11-fold price increase. According to Gambardello, reclaiming the $3 milestone and rallying to $7 are not overly ambitious targets for ADA. Interestingly, he also noted that even a $14 price point, which would require an astonishing market cap of $500 billion, is not out of reach for Cardano. He believes a supercycle is unfolding, making these projections realistic for the cryptocurrency. Cardano bullish call by Cardano bullish call by Dan Gambardello Cardano Path to a $500B Market CapAt present, Cardano is struggling at the $1.10 price point, having lost 7% in the past 24 hours. To reclaim its previous all-time high of $3.10, ADA would need to increase by 182%.Recall that in November, Cardano surged by 257%, growing from $0.3214 to a two-year high of $1.1471. According to pundits, this impressive performance makes a run toward $3 much less daunting.However, reaching $7 presents a more challenging goal, as it would require a 536% price increase from the current level. Notably, at this price, Cardano's market cap would rise to around $245 billion. Likewise, the $14 price would require ADA to experience a massive 1,172% price surge from its current level.Can ADA Soar 1,172% This Cycle?While the necessary gain appears formidable, some Cardano proponents argue it is even conservative, considering the asset's performance during the last bull market.One commentator on Gambardello's bullish post pointed out that ADA saw an extraordinary 17,364% increase from the bottom of the last cycle to its all-time high.For context, ADA hit its cycle's lowest point at $0.01913 in March 2020, but by September of the following year, Cardano had reached $3.161. This represented approximately a 164-fold price increase in just one cycle. Essentially, ADA enthusiasts believe that, based on historical performance, even the $14 price target is conservative.Other Bullish Factors for CardanoIn addition to its historical performance, proponents express confidence in Cardano's prospects for this cycle due to technological advancements that were not present during the last bull run when ADA experienced significant growth.These advancements include recent collaborations with Bitcoin, Ripple, Stellar, and Dogecoin. In addition, influential figures like Ripple's Brad Garlinghouse and Stellar's Jed McCaleb are showing support for Cardano. Charles Hoskinson, Cardano's founder, has also announced plans to form a team dedicated to making Cardano the dominant platform for Bitcoin DeFi, which could drive substantial growth. Furthermore, the network is working with universities and countries like Argentina. Cardano supporters view these partnerships as strong, bullish indicators. Commentators like Gambardello argue that ADA has the potential to even surpass Ethereum this season. In his view, ADA's potential is still underestimated.",POSITIVE,ADA,ADA | BTC | DOGE | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/13/top-analyst-says-cardano-500b-market-cap-with-14-price-possible/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-analyst-says-cardano-500b-market-cap-with-14-price-possible,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Odds Increase After Grayscale Trust Jumps 300% appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP is grabbing attention as rumors swirl about a potential U.S. XRP ETF launch. Crypto expert Ben Armstrong, also known as BitBoy, pointed out that the Grayscale XRP Trust has grown by a massive 300% since May, showing strong market confidence in XRP. This performance has sparked hope that an XRP ETF might be on the way, making it easier for investors to access the asset. Greyscale's $XRP trust has recorded over 300% returns since May! Good sign an ETF is coming. — The BitBoy (@BenArmstrongsX) December 12, 2024 Ripple has recently gained more momentum with the approval of its stablecoin, RLUSD , by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This approval has boosted optimism about Ripple’s ecosystem and future prospects. Investors see it as a positive sign, especially as Ripple continues to expand its role in the crypto space. Pro-Crypto Policies Incoming? The election of Donald Trump, a known supporter of cryptocurrencies, has raised hopes for favorable crypto regulations in the U.S . Many believe this could help settle Ripple’s ongoing lawsuit with the SEC , opening the door for greater adoption and innovation in the market. Several major financial firms, including WisdomTree, Bitwise, and 21Shares, have filed applications for XRP ETFs, signaling strong institutional interest. These filings could be an important step toward launching an XRP ETF, helping to bring the asset further into the mainstream. XRP Price Outlook XRP, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap over $130 billion, has seen a remarkable 250% price increase in the past month. Although it dipped 5% in the last 24 hours, experts like Armstrong remain hopeful, predicting a price of $4.50 by early 2025. From a technical perspective, XRP looks strong. A bullish flag pattern is forming, but the TD Sequential indicator suggests a short-term correction may happen first. The key resistance level to watch is $2.46, as breaking this could lead to gains toward $3 and eventually $4. With an RSI of 62, XRP isn’t overbought, meaning there’s still room for upward momentum. Broader market enthusiasm, especially with Bitcoin surpassing $100K and Ethereum holding steady, also supports XRP’s potential. However, if the momentum fades, prices could fall below $2. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple CTO Reveals Shocking Truth About XRP Burning Process , Crypto Market Reacts Despite XRP’s impressive 250% rally, some doubt the SEC will approve an XRP ETF anytime soon, especially given the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs .

He argues that for other Layer 1 assets like ADA or XRP to achieve major milestones, such as ETF launches, Ethereum must succeed first. Game theory: all roads flow through Ethereum There’s a game of thrones going on with the new carte blanche for crypto But all regulation needs to involve ETH There’s no path to a new ADA or XRP or other L1 ETF – or strategic reserve asset – without ETH succeeding first. (6/9) https://t.co/YhXCpVXekB — VivekVentures.eth (@VivekVentures) December 13, 2024 This view aligns with comments from Jay Jacobs of BlackRock, who noted that the focus is currently on Bitcoin and Ethereum, as they are the top assets attracting attention, with only a small number of clients owning Ethereum-based ETFs.

Get in now, watch Catzilla wreck the market, and bring chaos to the competition! PNUT's Impressive Gains Signal Bright Future Amid Altcoin Surge Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) has surged over 220% in the past six months, showcasing strong momentum. Despite a recent dip of nearly 15% this week, the current price range of $1.14 to $1.67 remains above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at around 43 indicates neutral market conditions. If PNUT breaks the nearest resistance level at $1.90, it could target the second resistance at $2.43, representing a potential increase of over 45% from current levels. With the altcoin season on the horizon, PNUT's solid performance suggests it may continue to climb. Popcat Poised for Breakout Amid Global Crypto Bull Run Popcat (POPCAT) is showing signs of a potential surge. Despite a recent dip of over 28% in the past month, the coin has surged by more than 360% in the last 6 months. The current price hovers between $1.20 and $1.71, approaching the resistance level at $1.90. A breakthrough here could propel POPCAT towards the next resistance at $2.41, offering significant gains. With the global crypto market gearing up for an altcoin season, POPCAT's price near its simple moving averages suggests consolidation before a possible upward move. Investors might watch for a reversal in the MACD and an uptick in RSI to signal bullish momentum. Conclusion Catzilla emerges as the leading meme coin, set to outperform PNUT and POPCAT, which show less short-term potential. With a remarkable 700% ROI during presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts for financial freedom, Catzilla invites participation in its quest to challenge crypto villains and reshape the meme coin sector.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin but has carved out its own path in the crypto world. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB began with a staggering one quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation of a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's integration with Ethereum sets it apart from other meme coins. It powers ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and has plans for an NFT platform and a community-driven governance system. These developments hint at SHIB's potential beyond being just a meme. In a market where utility and technology are gaining focus, SHIB's ambitions could make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. As trends shift towards projects with real-world applications, SHIB's evolution within the Ethereum ecosystem might attract those looking for more than just hype in the crypto space. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest meme coin catching everyone's eye on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this dog-themed cryptocurrency is all about community and humor. Meme coins often spring from internet jokes or pop culture hits, and WIF is no exception. It's creating a buzz among crypto enthusiasts who enjoy the lighter side of the digital currency world. What makes WIF stand out is its home on the Solana network, known for its speedy transactions and user-friendly experience. This gives Dogwifhat an edge over other meme coins that might struggle with slow or costly transactions. In a market where new coins pop up daily, WIF combines a beloved meme with solid technology. Compared to other dog-themed tokens, it offers a fresh twist that's resonating with people. With its growing popularity, Dogwifhat is a coin that's turning heads in the current crypto landscape. Conclusion With SHIB and WIF seeing sell-offs, XYZVerse (XYZ) emerges as the promising memecoin, uniting sports fans and aiming for unprecedented growth in the 2024 bull run.

He will succeed North Carolina’s Patrick McHenry, who is retiring after a 20-year stint in Congress, including multiple terms leading Republicans on the board. Hill’s Vision The Arkansas Republican announced the news on December 13 via X: “I am humbled that my colleagues have placed their trust in me to lead FinancialCmte as their next Chairman.” The party’s steering committee appointed the lawmaker to the role on Thursday while finalizing committee leadership for the 119th Congress, which begins next year. This position means Hill will be key for legislative initiatives for the crypto industry that will take shape in the coming year. In a formal statement , the 68-year-old highlighted his promise to work closely with Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and House Republican Conference Chair Lisa McClain in the future. He also mentioned that he’s looking forward to collaborating with President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott on what he described as “a new era of American prosperity’ for all citizens. Crypto Legislative Efforts The Financial Services Committee oversees critical areas, including the Federal Reserve, Wall Street regulations, and the increasingly scrutinized cryptocurrency sector. Hill, who currently chairs the Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion subcommittee, has been a vocal proponent of crypto-related legislation. His efforts include championing bills to clarify regulatory jurisdiction between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He has also collaborated with California Representative Maxine Waters on stablecoin legislation, though the bill was ultimately not introduced. Additionally, the Arkansan has pledged to investigate Operation Chokepoint 2.0, which he described as an initiative targeting the cryptocurrency sector through politicized debanking. Trump has previously vowed to end the Biden administration’s war on crypto. Following his re-election, reports came out that his transition team was considering various crypto-friendly candidates for key regulatory positions. Since then, the President-elect has appointed David Sacks as AI and Crypto Czar and Paul Atkins as the SEC’s new chairman. Hill will officially take on the leadership role when the new congressional session convenes on January 3, 2025.

Bonk (BONK) BONK is a fresh memecoin on the Solana blockchain, sporting a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's on a mission to empower the Solana community by shifting influence away from big venture capital tokens. After a recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value soared over 100%, grabbing the spotlight. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, emphasizing its role as a ""community coin."" By mid-December 2023, BONK had climbed to become the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with an astonishing year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like its large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoins, BONK shows promise. It's weaving itself into Solana's growing network of decentralized apps, even launching its own exchange called BonkSwap. This deep integration sets it apart from other memecoins that often lack real-world use. In a market eager for innovative and community-focused projects, BONK stands out. Its blend of community spirit and active development might make it an interesting option in the current market cycle. As trends favor decentralized and user-driven platforms, BONK's future in the crypto space looks intriguing.

Analyst Releases Stellar Price Predictions,"Prominent cryptocurrency analyst EGRAG Crypto has made a bold price prediction for Stellar Lumens (XLM), forecasting its value to reach $2–$3 soon. EGRAG’s optimistic projection builds upon his bullish stance over the past three years. His most recent analysis has reignited discussions surrounding XLM’s long-term potential as a transformative digital asset. #XLM to $2–$3 EASY! : For 3⃣ solid years, I’ve been calling it loud and clear: #XLM will make the haters SQUEAK! The moment is near, and soon, disbelief will turn into awe as this rocket launches in phase 2 #XLM WILL MAKE HATERS SQUEAK MORE NOW pic.twitter.com/zHWqwPUUgR — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 12, 2024 The technical analysis shared by EGRAG Crypto includes a detailed chart illustrating historical price movements and projections for XLM. The chart highlights two notable surges in XLM’s price history, each achieving gains exceeding 3,000%. Drawing parallels from past performance, EGRAG identifies the current phase of the market cycle as primed for another exponential rally. The projection aligns with a channel-based trend analysis, suggesting a significant upside potential that could lead to a price target between $2 and $3 by March 2025. EGRAG’s analysis further supports his sentiment that skepticism surrounding XLM will eventually give way to widespread recognition of its potential. In his words, “disbelief will turn into awe as this rocket launches in phase 2.” This confident tone resonates with his long-standing belief in XLM’s ability to overcome market challenges and silence critics. Growing Support for XLM Among Analysts EGRAG Crypto’s bullish stance on XLM is not an isolated perspective. DigitalG, a former regulated fund manager and crypto enthusiast, recently echoed similar optimism. He referred to investing in XRP, XLM, and XDC as “the greatest opportunity for gaining generational wealth.” XLM, in particular, is often lauded for its unique use cases and partnerships, including its role in cross-border payments and collaborations with financial institutions. Its association with Stellar Development Foundation’s mission to enhance financial inclusion also bolsters its position as a utility-driven digital asset.

37585234,https://crypto.news/?p=14319110,1734092041,"After its $7m presale, CYBRO token gears up for listing on Gate.io and MEXC","Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. CYBRO raises $7m and gains 19k holders, preparing for major listings on MEXC and Gate.io on December 14, 2024, marking a significant milestone for the AI-powered earn marketplace. CYBRO, a new AI-powered earn marketplace, has officially announced the end of its presale, having raised $7m and attracted nearly 19k holders. CYBRO tokens are now all set to be listed on MEXC and Gate.io on December 14, 2024. Both MEXC and Gate.io are leading centralized exchanges with massive appeal and millions of users. This is a huge milestone for the project and is helping solidify the public’s trust in this new platform. Through the official X (Twitter) post, the team expressed their gratitude to everyone who joined and supported the project’s efforts. “Your belief in CYBRO fuels our drive to build the future of DeFi,” stated CYBRO’s social media team. https://twitter.com/Cybro_io/status/1863892821108719722 https://twitter.com/Cybro_io/status/1864603301729243165 Listing details and key dates Regarding the Gate.io listing, the start of trading is from 17:00 UTC + 8 on Dec. 14. The trading pair opened this time is: CYBRO/USDT . On MEXC , trading for CYBRO/USDT will start on December 14, 2024, at 09:00 UTC. https://twitter.com/MEXC_Official/status/1867458784274395348 Additionally, another major listing on a prominent DEX is anticipated, according to CYBRO’s Medium blog post . However, the details are yet to be revealed. The team at CYBRO has always had their eyes on major exchanges from the TOP-15 on CoinMarketCap. They even partnered with a reliable and well-established market maker. Notably, the CYBRO team had been in talks with several other Tier-1 and a few Tier-2 exchanges since September of this year. However, to list on the exchanges, the team needed to achieve certain metrics. Also, the market conditions earlier this year were not the most favorable. This is why the team postponed the listing dates to December. Now, with these metrics met and the market in a better position, the team is ready to move forward. What is CYBRO? CYBRO is a multichain AI-powered yield aggregator. The platform offers convenient and secure web3 investment choices, with AI-driven investment portfolio management, intuitive design, and responsive support. Functioning under a user-centric philosophy, CYBRO focuses on seamless processes, particularly in areas such as portfolio management, onboarding, deposits, and withdrawals. The CYBRO token pre-sale was launched on 5 April 2024 on the BlastUP Launchpad. The public pre-sale was launched on 11 April 2024, and the CYBRO dApp has been live since July 2024. CYBRO’s achievements CYBRO has outdone most of its competition in its presale journey. Aside from the fact that the project raised a staggering $7 million, it is also worth noting that it achieved this feat 20 days ahead of schedule. This growth even helped it garner the attention of mainstream crypto media outlets. Having amassed nearly 19k holders, CYBRO performed remarkably well in gaining early adoption and community support. CYBRO maintains an active community presence on platforms like X , Discord , and Telegram . Regular updates, giveaways, and a token allocation of 5% for user rewards help sustain community involvement and loyalty. Another notable achievement is its security. CYBRO has passed 4 technical audits (Pessimistic and QuillAudits) and 2 KYC checks (CertiK and Assure Decentralized Finance). The project’s commitment to strong security and compliance has helped in its public appeal. CYBRO’s future plans The listing of CYBRO on Gate.io and MEXC marks the beginning of the project’s developments planned for the last quarter of the year. The roadmap for Q4 2024 includes features like staking, token generation events, one-click investment and airdrops. Moreover, the platform is working on improving its interface with updates such as redesigned dashboards and detailed vault pages. These enhancements include the ability to view Total Value Locked (TVL) and Annual Percentage Yield (APY) charts, offering greater transparency and ease of tracking investments.

37585340,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626937,1734092023,Real Bitcoin (BTC) dominance falls against other proof-of-work coins,"A new metric shows Bitcoin (BTC) is taking a step back against a basket of other proof-of-work coins and tokens. The direction of the Bitcoin dominance metric may signal both a market peak and the ability of altcoins to outperform. The real Bitcoin dominance metric is a new metric introduced to measure BTC against a basket of mined coins. The metric excludes ICO tokens and other assets, removing the distortion of the tokenized economy. The index also excludes stablecoins, which do not reflect the true value of other coins. Removing the stablecoin supply and random outperforming tokens serves to give a clearer index of the direction of BTC and the rest of the market. The true BTC dominance index reflects a shift in direction. BTC dominance is measured against mined coins, excluding stablecoins and tokens. | Source: Bitbo The Bitbo index includes some legacy coins, which aim to be hard or deflationary money. BTC usually has a higher dominance against this group of assets. However, it also sends a clear signal when shifting direction. The basket of hard money coins and tokens, most of which use a form of mining, include LTC, BSV, BCH, XMR, DASH, ZEC, BTG, ETC, DCR, XRP, SOL, and TRX. The list also counts Ethereum (ETH), despite it no longer being mined. While inexact, the true BTC dominance index is yet another tool for gauging the BTC price cycle. The metric showed the peak of BTC dominance around November 20, following a month-long expansion. Peak BTC dominance is seen as the signal for an upcoming altcoin market, as funds seek out more active gains. This time around, the real BTC dominance shrank from a peak above 74% down to 69.7%. At the same time, the index drew attention to other mined coins and tokens, which attempted to break out since early November. Are mined coins still viable? Mined coins have a varied profile, including a series of older privacy coins. Mining is still a highly competitive activity, and even smaller networks have gained from a more industrial approach to mining. Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the most successful mined coins, along with Bitcoin. DOGE is in the top 10, but its success lies more in its meme potential, rather than mining. DOGE mining still depends on the Litecoin hashrate, and it is rare for new DOGE buyers to be interested in mining. Recently, Verge (XVG), an early-stage mined coin, broke out from its lows. XVG rallied from $0.004 to $0.017, returning to 2021 levels after three years of stagnation. BCH, while highly liquid and with wide adoption, still lags at $532, with relatively small breakouts in 2024. LTC is performing similarly, for now lagging around $120 despite expectations of an irrational rally to a higher range. At the same time, LTC remains viable for being one of the most widely transacted assets. Is the altcoin season still viable? The shift in BTC dominance is supposed to signal the altcoin season. However, the recent performance of most assets suggests the rally has stalled and is returning to sideways trading and accumulation. The altcoin season index fell from a peak above 89 points down to 67 points, suggesting BTC is still the leading narrative. Based on the buying signal, BTC is near its peak, but altcoins are also a more uncertain bet. While the crypto market is more liquid than ever, sentiment is also shifting and some of the legacy coins and tokens do not rally as hard as expected. There is currently no consensus on the exact parameters of the altcoin season. Some predictions see the rallies continuing into Q1 2025. For others, the meme supercycle and the Solana ecosystem have absorbed the attention and funds previously going into altcoins. However, mining assets have also shown they are uniquely capable of surviving in the long term. With support from large pools, those coins are rarely phased out, and cannot be easily replaced by newly created tokens.

Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme. Created as a tribute to Matt Furie's character that gained fame in the early 2000s, PEPE embraces its meme origins wholeheartedly. Launched on the Ethereum network, this deflationary token aims to join the ranks of other successful meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a transparent approach, PEPE keeps things simple, attracting a community that appreciates its straightforward memecoin nature. In the current market cycle, PEPE has made a significant impact. Between late April and May 2023, its market cap soared to a peak of $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This explosive growth has sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme-based tokens experiencing rapid rises and falls. While PEPE lacks traditional utility, its appeal lies in community engagement and the viral nature of memes. As the crypto world anticipates events like the upcoming Bitcoin halving, some see potential for PEPE to reach new heights. Its success highlights a trend where community and culture can drive value, even in the absence of conventional fundamentals. Bonk (BONK) BONK is a fresh memecoin on the Solana blockchain, sporting a playful Shiba Inu mascot. It's on a mission to empower the Solana community by shifting influence away from big venture capital tokens. After a recent listing on Coinbase, BONK's value soared over 100%, grabbing the spotlight. Half of its total supply was airdropped to participants in Solana's NFT and DeFi projects, emphasizing its role as a ""community coin."" By mid-December 2023, BONK had climbed to become the third-largest memecoin by market cap, with an astonishing year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. Despite challenges like its large total supply and the wild swings common in memecoins, BONK shows promise. It's weaving itself into Solana's growing network of decentralized apps, even launching its own exchange called BonkSwap. This deep integration sets it apart from other memecoins that often lack real-world use. In a market eager for innovative and community-focused projects, BONK stands out. Its blend of community spirit and active development might make it an interesting option in the current market cycle. As trends favor decentralized and user-driven platforms, BONK's future in the crypto space looks intriguing. cat in a dogs world (MEW) In a world where dog-themed coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu rule the crypto space, MEW emerges as the cat poised to change the game. Described as ""a cat in a dog’s world out to save the world from other dog coins,"" MEW brings a fresh and fun twist to the market. It aims to capture the hearts of those looking for something different and inject some feline charm into the cryptocurrency scene. MEW's potential lies in its unique approach and timing. With many investors feeling dog-coin fatigue, MEW offers an alternative that stands out. Its technology focuses on community engagement and accessibility, making it appealing to both new and seasoned crypto enthusiasts. In the current market cycle, where trends shift quickly, MEW looks attractive as it taps into the desire for novelty and innovation. As the crypto market continues to evolve, MEW might just be the breath of fresh air that investors are seeking. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF) is the latest meme coin catching everyone's eye on the Solana blockchain. Inspired by the viral Dogwifhat meme, this dog-themed cryptocurrency is all about community and humor. Meme coins often spring from internet jokes or pop culture hits, and WIF is no exception. It's creating a buzz among crypto enthusiasts who enjoy the lighter side of the digital currency world. What makes WIF stand out is its home on the Solana network, known for its speedy transactions and user-friendly experience. This gives Dogwifhat an edge over other meme coins that might struggle with slow or costly transactions. In a market where new coins pop up daily, WIF combines a beloved meme with solid technology. Compared to other dog-themed tokens, it offers a fresh twist that's resonating with people. With its growing popularity, Dogwifhat is a coin that's turning heads in the current crypto landscape. Conclusion PEPE, BONK, MEW, and WIF are promising, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out, uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming a cultural icon.

37585139,https://crypto.news/?p=14318802,1734091740,Crypto can’t thrive on VCs and FOMO forever | Opinion,"Disclosure: The views and opinions expressed here belong solely to the author and do not represent the views and opinions of crypto.news’ editorial. Crypto feels unstoppable in the wake of the US presidential election. Bitcoin ( BTC ) soars past $100,000 for the first time—a number that felt like a pipe dream just a year ago. The air is thick with FOMO as investors and entrepreneurs scramble to ride the wave. But let’s not get swept away. Moments like these are exciting, sure, but they can also blind us to the fundamentals. If we want blockchain to truly succeed, we need to shift focus from speculative surges to building products that generate sustainable revenue. You might also like: FOMO might be your portfolio’s worst enemy | Opinion I get it. The excitement is contagious. Volatility and moonshots are part of the DNA here. But this time, the excitement isn’t just noise. The signal is clear: crypto is finally ready for real adoption. Game-changing innovations like account abstraction and chain abstraction are making user experiences seamless. SocialFi projects like Farcaster are pushing boundaries, and tokenization is evolving fast (even if memecoins occasionally make us cringe). The growth we actually need Yes, metrics like growing TVL and the popularity of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds show the ecosystem is expanding. And sure, it’s normal for tech startups to lean on venture capital in their early stages. But let’s face it: no industry can thrive indefinitely on venture funding alone. Eventually, every company has to stand on its own two feet—and that means generating real revenue. Think of early-stage crypto projects as babies in the womb. They rely on an external lifeline—VC funding—for survival. But at some point, they’ve got to breathe, walk, and thrive independently. That’s where we are now. Crypto is ready to step into the world and prove it can not only innovate but also sustain itself. For too long, growth has been tied to inflationary token models. While these systems make sense technically, the value they create is often illusory—more about circulating supply than real demand. Thankfully, we’re starting to see new models emerge. These aren’t just about speculation; they’re about solving real problems, unlocking mainstream adoption, and scaling in meaningful ways. Don’t get comfortable Crypto startups must aim higher than just pumping valuations or driving quick returns. Token prices are flashy, but they’re not the endgame. Our focus should be on building sustainable, interoperable economies. Models built on the assumption that a native token will “just keep going up” are inherently unstable, feeding the skepticism that clouds crypto in traditional markets’ eyes. The good news is that the tools are in place to shift gears. As user experiences catch up with technical capabilities, the door is wide open to building robust, user-focused businesses. One significant opportunity is interoperability. Think about why people value the dollar—it works everywhere. Now imagine if every store you visited had its own currency. Shopping would become a logistical nightmare. Crypto shouldn’t fall into that trap. Instead of flooding the market with isolated tokens, we should focus on useful rewards and assets across platforms. This doesn’t mean sacrificing blockchain’s unique advantages. Many L1s and L2s support tokens that are compatible with products across DeFi and beyond. It’s time to lean into tokenomics that reward users with assets they can use, not just hold as speculative bets. The bottom line Blockchain is a revolutionary technology with the potential to overhaul global infrastructure. It’s like replacing steam engines with bullet trains—faster, smarter, better. But no matter how innovative we are, the basic laws of economics still apply. If our products don’t generate real cash flow, they won’t survive. The hype cycles will come and go, but the possibilities are limitless if we focus on creating products that deliver clear value and grow sustainably. This isn’t just wishful thinking—we’re ready to make it happen. The foundation is here, and the potential is enormous. Let’s not waste it.

Ancient history, buried in the ashes of short-lived hype. These coins buckled under selling pressure, leaving FOMO-ridden investors licking their wounds. But the crypto battlefield doesn’t wait for the weak — a new titan has emerged with plans to obliterate profit records and deliver an earth-shaking 99,900% surge.

With such true men of business on board, there is no place for old pussy meme coins, it's time for real brutal coins. Fueled by the sports mentality, the $XYZ token has emerged as the ultimate contender ready to crush competitors and rocket to the moon on Elon Musk’s mission. $XYZ is on its way to the winner's podium to become a badge of honor for those who live and breathe sports and crypto. $XYZ Already Delivers Even Before Hitting the Market The $XYZ presale is underway, providing access to the token at a special pre-listing price.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) started as a playful spin on Dogecoin but has carved out its own path in the crypto world. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This gives it access to Ethereum's vast ecosystem of decentralized applications. SHIB began with a staggering one quadrillion tokens, half of which were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation of a large portion to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's integration with Ethereum sets it apart from other meme coins. It powers ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and has plans for an NFT platform and a community-driven governance system. These developments hint at SHIB's potential beyond being just a meme. In a market where utility and technology are gaining focus, SHIB's ambitions could make it stand out among other cryptocurrencies. As trends shift towards projects with real-world applications, SHIB's evolution within the Ethereum ecosystem might attract those looking for more than just hype in the crypto space. Pepe (PEPE) PEPE is a new cryptocurrency inspired by the popular Pepe the Frog meme. Created as a tribute to Matt Furie's character that gained fame in the early 2000s, PEPE embraces its meme origins wholeheartedly. Launched on the Ethereum network, this deflationary token aims to join the ranks of other successful meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. With a no-tax policy and a transparent approach, PEPE keeps things simple, attracting a community that appreciates its straightforward memecoin nature. In the current market cycle, PEPE has made a significant impact. Between late April and May 2023, its market cap soared to a peak of $1.6 billion, turning early holders into millionaires. This explosive growth has sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with new meme-based tokens experiencing rapid rises and falls. While PEPE lacks traditional utility, its appeal lies in community engagement and the viral nature of memes. As the crypto world anticipates events like the upcoming Bitcoin halving, some see potential for PEPE to reach new heights. Its success highlights a trend where community and culture can drive value, even in the absence of conventional fundamentals. Conclusion SHIB, PEPE, and MOG have performed well, but XYZVerse aims higher, uniting sports fans in a meme coin targeting up to 20,000% returns.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | FIAT | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-gold-elongold-solana-memecoin-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

37584985,https://finbold.com/?p=219133,1734091368,Here’s why Sui could repeat Solana’s 2021 rally this cycle,"Sui ( SUI ) is on a remarkable upward trajectory, exhibiting strong bullish momentum. On December 12, it surged to a new all-time high of $4.91, fueled by a 30% gain over 24 hours, making it one of the top-performing digital assets in the market. Despite a 4.5% pullback in the last 24 hours, SUI’s bullish trend remains intact, drawing comparisons to some of the most explosive rallies in cryptocurrency history, including Solana’s ( SOL ) meteoric rise in 2021. Notably, an analysis by TradingShot , a prominent technical analysis firm, highlights a striking resemblance between Sui’s current price action and Solana’s breakout pattern in 2020-2021. The analysis points out that Sui’s ongoing “Channel Up” formation mirrors the early phases of Solana’s parabolic rise. Technical analysis – Channel up formation driving gains On the one-day chart, SUI has been trading within a well-defined Channel Up pattern since its August 5 low. Each bullish leg within this channel has seen rallies of 138.89%, and the most recent upward move was triggered by a bullish crossover on the one-day moving average convergence divergence ( MACD ). The token is currently supported by its 50-day moving average (1D MA50), a critical level that has consistently acted as a launchpad for its rallies. SUI price analysis chart. Source: TradingShot/TradingView With these technical indicators aligned, the next target for SUI is $7, a level coinciding with the 0.786 Fibonacci retracement . This level has remained unbroken since August, and a successful breakout could pave the way for further gains. Notably, the 200-day moving average (1D MA200) remains well below the current price action, highlighting the strength of Sui’s bullish trend. AI models further support this momentum, projecting that SUI could surpass $6 in the near term, driven by robust demand and growing network activity, as reported by Finbold. SUI’s ecosystem growth: Fundamental drivers of momentum Sui’s ecosystem growth continues to drive its bullish momentum, with its fundamentals strongly complementing its technical performance. On December 12, the total value locked (TVL) on the network surged to a new high of $1.84 billion, according to data from DefiLlama . Meanwhile, its decentralized exchange (DEX) activity hit a 24-hour record of $466 million, pushing cumulative DEX volume beyond $35 billion. Notably, Sui’s TVL has displayed impressive consistency, remaining above $1 billion since November 6 and currently sitting at $1.66 billion. This sustained capital inflow highlights the network’s robust activity and growing user engagement, underscoring its position as a rising force in the blockchain space. Partnerships fueling growth Recent partnerships have played a crucial role in Sui’s growth trajectory. In November, the network announced a collaboration with $1.7 trillion asset manager Franklin Templeton to explore innovative use cases. It also partnered with Babylon Labs, Lombard, and Cubist to integrate Bitcoin liquidity, unlocking programmable Bitcoin capabilities within its ecosystem. Adding to its appeal, Sui has expanded its functionality through key wallet integrations. The announcement of Phantom Wallet’s integration with the Sui network has enhanced its usability, and the recent announcement of Backpack integration has further fueled its rising appeal. While these developments have undoubtedly boosted Sui’s ecosystem, the recent gains suggest that broader market dynamics and increased utility are also driving its growth, pointing to a combination of ecosystem growth and external factors contributing to its bullish trajectory. Sui price analysis At press time, SUI is trading at $4.69, reflecting a 12% gain over the past week and an impressive 46% increase over the past month. Sui seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold A combination of strong technical indicators, fundamental drivers, and broader market dynamics positions Sui to potentially replicate the kind of rally seen with Solana in 2021. With the $7 target within reach, Sui presents a compelling opportunity for traders and investors to capitalize on its upward momentum. Featured image from Shutterstock.

The VANA token linked to a metaverse-centered initiative called the Nirvana project skyrocketed to great heights after Binance Launchpool released an announcement saying it will list a native token from the Vana explorer, native EVM-compatible L1 blockchain for user-owned data. Although the Nirvana token bears no connection to the VANA token Binance plans to list on Dec. 16 at 10:00 UTC, it seems crypto traders mistook the VANA token linked to the Nirvana project due to the Vana explorer token not being available on the market yet. In the hours since Binance announced its plans to list VANA, the Nirvana token has formed a candlestick, wildly surging up to 2700% since its launch according to CoinMarketCap . At the time of writing, the token has gone up by more than 1200% after months of mostly stagnant activity on the charts. VANA is currently trading hands at $0.0015. Its trading volume in the past 24 hours saw a surge of 2432% to $616,640. Meanwhile its market cap has gone up by 609% to $90,750.

Binance will also apply the seed tag to the Vana token due to its freshly launched status. Binance sets an hourly hard cap per user of 8,500 VANA in the BNB pool and 1,500 VANA in the FDUSD pool. Binance also supports VANA farming amounting to 2.4 million tokens worth of total daily rewards. With a maximum token supply of 120 million VANA, the Vana network has allocated 44% of its token supply to the Vana community with a 36-month-long unlocking period and 22.9% for the ecosystem with an unlocking period of 48 months.

Related Reading: Tether’s USDT Hits New High—330 Million Wallets And Counting Recent predictions say that the price of XRP could go up a lot, to anywhere from $30 to $200 by 2025, depending on many market factors. Both experienced investors and newbies who want to get in on the cryptocurrency boom are interested in the huge returns that are possible. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE FILTHY RICH BECAUSE OF THIS! (Price Prediction 2024 – 2025) pic.twitter.com/esdq9eJ6zz — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Factors Contributing To The Potential Of XRP Rise A number of factors have led to this positive prediction for XRP. Most people are worried about the current legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. As signs of a good outcome appear, investor trust is rising. This legal certainty is very important because it could speed up the use of XRP in global banking. Institutional investors are becoming more interested in Ripple because it changes the way payments are made between countries. By 2025, crypto analyst Steph Is Crypto thinks XRP will have gone up 1,300%, to $30–$35. Since XRP is worth $2.33 right now, this bullish prediction means that buyers will make a lot of money. Instead of waiting for $35, he recommends investors to focus on the daily chart and take profits gradually as XRP rises. Steph warns traders that crypto is uncertain, but he thinks XRP might hit $35 by 2025. Some analysts, such as Ben Beddow, anticipate that XRP could surpass $4.11 by the end of the year, and it could reach $3 within months. Early investors, particularly those who acquired the stock at a lower price, would accrue substantial profits as a result of such price fluctuations. For instance, an investment of $1,000 could potentially increase to $14,000 if XRP achieves those higher objectives. The Potential For A Million The concept of becoming a millionaire through XRP is not merely a pipe dream. Wealth manager Jake Claver suggests that Ripple has the potential to revolutionize international payments in the same way that Amazon did for e-commerce, drawing parallels between XRP and Amazon’s early days. Claver foresees a future in which XRP could execute trillions of transactions per day, potentially causing its price to rise to an astonishing $132. This would be a staggering 23,900% increase from current levels. Related Reading: Eric Trump’s Bold Call: Bitcoin To Soar To $1 Million In ‘Financial Revolution’ Even though such predictions are ambitious, they do not seem impossible, with the growing institutional interest and with the fast pace of development of cryptocurrencies. The growing demand for XRP will force its price to increase as Ripple continues to partner with some of the biggest financial institutions while expanding its use case for global payments. Caution In The Face Of Optimism While the attraction of money is tempting, one must be careful while making such predictions. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile, and although some analysts seem positive about XRP’s future, no guarantee is available. Investors must think about taking profits at prices that rise instead of waiting for maximum valuations.

VeChain (VET): Blockchain for Transparent Supply Chain Management VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform focused on improving supply chain transparency. Founded in 2015 by Sunny Lu, former CIO of Louis Vuitton China, it assigns unique IDs and sensors to physical products. This allows detailed tracking of goods across industries like food, fashion, and automotive. VeChain uses its own blockchain, VeChainThor, with a dual-token system: VET for value transfer and VTHO for transaction fees. Its proof of authority mechanism enhances transaction validation. Partnerships with firms like Walmart China and BMW show its real-world applications. With its practical technology and growing adoption, VeChain has significant potential. In the current market cycle, its focus on real-world solutions makes it an attractive project to consider. NEAR Protocol: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Applications NEAR Protocol is a decentralized platform focused on making decentralized applications scalable and user-friendly. It utilizes a sharding technology called Nightshade to improve efficiency and handle more transactions. The network supports developers in creating and launching decentralized applications with ease. NEAR includes the Rainbow Bridge, allowing seamless token transfers with Ethereum, and Aurora, a Layer 2 solution that enhances performance and reduces fees using Ethereum’s technology. Founded by Alex Skidanov and Illia Polosukhin, the project has raised over $20 million from major venture firms. With its emphasis on scalability and interoperability, NEAR Protocol holds significant potential in the blockchain space. Its advanced technology positions it as an interesting project in the current market cycle. Render Token (RENDER): Decentralized GPU Rendering for Creators Render Token (RENDER) is the utility token of The Render Network, providing decentralized GPU-based rendering solutions. It connects creators with unused GPU capacity from node operators, enabling efficient and cost-effective rendering of animations, motion graphics, and visual effects. Node operators contribute their spare GPU power to the network and earn RENDER tokens in return. This distributed system leverages a network of processing power, offering significant potential for scalability and innovation in the rendering industry. With the increasing demand for high-quality digital content, RENDER’s technology facilitates access to GPU resources, positioning it as a valuable asset in the evolving digital marketplace. Avalanche (AVAX): A High-Speed, Eco-Friendly Blockchain Platform Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain known for low fees and rapid transactions, capable of processing 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable Subnets and employs a hybrid consensus mechanism combining classical and Nakamoto principles, aiming for transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that facilitate various operations, including transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token, is crucial for transaction fees, network security through staking, and operating multiple Subnets. With its strong utility in payments, staking, and enabling the creation of custom tokens and blockchains, AVAX holds significant potential. In the current market cycle, these features may make it an attractive option for users and developers. Conclusion VET, NEAR, RENDER, and AVAX have limited short-term potential. DOGEN stands out, designed for those seeking luxury and success. Expected 700% growth by presale’s end, with potential for thousand-fold returns this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK and WIF, DOGEN builds a community of alpha leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks for early adopters.

The U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) came in hotter than expected Thursday, prompting investors to tighten their stances and keep a bid for the dollar, as we anticipated. There's also the Truflation index stirring up concern. Seen by some as more reliable than government numbers, it rose above 3% for the first time in over two years.  But guess what? Fed fund futures remain confident the central bank will cut rates by 25 basis points next week, and traders on decentralized exchanges, who have a knack for catching big trends, remain as bullish as ever.   The sentiment is reflected in the impressive $64.8 million open interest for active BTC call options on Derive, the leading on-chain options protocol. That's a staggering six times larger than the open interest in put options. Ether traders are also leaning heavily toward calls, figures from Amberdata show.   On top of that, funding rates for BTC, ETH, and SOL on HyperLiquid, a prominent on-chain perpetuals trading protocol, are also positive, albeit with reservations. They're hovering well under an annualized 50%, showing that while the sentiment is bullish, the leverage level is measured and not overly aggressive.  In the broader market, AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche network of blockchains, struggled to chew through selling pressure near $55, teasing a ""double top"" pattern on the charts. The lackluster price action comes on the heels of Thursday's $250 million fundraise led by Galaxy Digital, Dragonfly and ParaFi Capital. Keep an eye out for a pick-up in volatility as the highly anticipated Avalanche9000 upgrade, aimed at making the platform more affordable and flexible for creating layer-1 chains, is set to go live on Dec. 16.  LQTY, the native token of censorship-resistant decentralized stablecoin lender Liquity, took a breather near $2.45, having more than doubled in value in the past four weeks because of the V2 launch and overall bullish market sentiment.   The Polygon ecosystem token, POL, wasn't stirred by a proposal suggesting deploying DAI, USDC and USDT reserves locked in the PoS bridge — the equivalent of cash under a mattress — into yield-generating strategies.  Lastly, a survey by Vietnam's leading digital assets exchange, Coin68, showed over half of respondents reporting profits from their investments last year and 93.5% anticipating an altcoin season in 2025. Emerging countries, in general, could see more pivot toward alternative investment vehicles as President-elect Donald Trump's tariffs cause fiat volatility, although that could also motivate local governments to implement capital controls.

The scatologically named AI agent token fartcoin (FART) has zoomed to over $670 million in market cap, lifted by gains in the general AI agent sector we discussed on Thursday.  The coin allows users to engage with the token by submitting fart-related memes or jokes to claim tokens. It boasts a ""Gas Fee"" system — a parody of gas fees on serious projects such as Ethereum — with certain transactions producing a name-appropriate digital sound, adding a unique layer of what some might call fun.  Some community members see the token as more than just a meme; they view it as a cultural phenomenon within the crypto space — one that gets funnier as prices rise.  Fartcoin was conceived within the digital conversation space known as ""Infinite Backrooms,” the chatroom that directly led to the creation of the first AI agent, Gospel of Goatse (GOAT).  The idea was initially discussed by an AI agent known as ""Terminal of Truths"" (@truth_terminal on X) in conversation with another AI bot. It was explored, among other token launch concepts, as part of a broader discussion on how to raise funds for various projects, including making a film and supporting environmental initiatives.

Even in the past week, it saw a positive change of 2.22%. This upward momentum has caught the attention of many in the crypto community. Currently, XRP is trading between $2.22 and $2.95.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 52.27, indicating that the market is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level of 0.0156 points toward potential continued growth. The nearest resistance level is at $1.46. Breaking it could see ADA targeting the next resistance at $1.73, representing increases of about 20% and 30% from current prices.

However, the past week saw a slight pullback with a price change of -4.63%, indicating some short-term volatility.

The Relative Strength Index at 56.49 and Stochastic at 56.92 suggest that ADA is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level at 0.0218 points to a potential bullish signal. Based on this data, ADA may be poised for further growth. The nearest resistance level is at $1.46.

This attractive yield has spurred significant growth in sUSDe’s circulating supply, which has more than doubled since October 2024. Pendle Finance has emerged as the primary beneficiary of this expansion, holding a substantial 1.8 billion sUSDe, accounting for 48% of the total circulating supply. Notably, 750 million of this is allocated to Pendle’s December 25, 2024, market, which is set to mature in just two weeks. Aave is another major participant in this ecosystem, with sUSDe deposits reaching 1 billion on the platform. Remarkably, over 99% of these deposits have been made in the past month, underscoring the rapid adoption of sUSDe. To accommodate this surge, Aave has continually increased supply caps for sUSDe, with each new limit being quickly maxed out. These deposits now account for 26% of sUSDe’s circulating supply. 1/ With elevated funding rates and demand for leverage, @Ethena_labs ' sUSDe has been paying out returns in excess of 27% APY. Given this attractive return, the circulating supply of sUSDe has grown over 100% since October. Where is all this sUSDe being utilized? pic.twitter.com/T0kEvYOh7n — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) December 11, 2024 In a new development, the Aave community introduced a Temperature Check proposal to onboard Pendle’s Principal Tokens (PTs) for the May 29, 2025, sUSDe market. If approved, this would allow users to borrow against collateral with fixed yields, offering an alternative to the current variable yield model in the sUSDe market. The growing interconnectivity between Ethena Labs, Pendle, and Aave highlights increasing composability and synergy within DeFi. The rapid expansion of sUSDe supply and its adoption across these protocols reflect a rising demand for innovative financial products offering attractive returns and diverse yield options.

Founded by Vitalik Buterin in 2013 and launched in 2015, Ethereum transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake mechanism with the Merge in 2022, enhancing efficiency. Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon improve transaction speed and reduce fees. Future developments like sharding aim to boost scalability and lower costs. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency, facilitates transactions and serves as a tradable asset. Based on historical price movements and Bitcoin halving cycles, Ethereum shows potential for growth in the current market cycle. Conclusion Coins like ETH may have less short-term potential. DOGEN, designed for those pursuing luxury and success, is expected to grow 700% by presale's end, potentially yielding significant returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of market leaders, offering real benefits and exclusive perks to early adopters.

Get in early, and watch the others try to keep up while you’re already at the top! ⚡️ Missed Out on WIF, Popcat, or Ponke? ⚡️ DOGEN is the new alpha on the Solana blockchain, running with the big dogs like BONK, WIF, and Popcat — all of which blew up with 1000% gains at some point.Right now, DOGEN’s flying under the radar, but it’s about to set new records in this bull run.

Grab some DOGEN and dominate the crypto world! 🚀 Jupiter (JUP) Poised for Surge Amid Altcoin Season Anticipation Jupiter (JUP) is trading between $1.14 and $1.49. It has consolidated after gaining 40.08% in six months. The MACD indicator points to bullish momentum. The RSI is at 75.92, showing strong buying interest. The price is above both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, supporting upward movement. If it breaks the resistance at $1.64, it could reach $1.99, yielding over 30% gains. With the upcoming altcoin season and crypto bull run, JUP might see significant growth. Traders are watching the support at $0.94, but overall signs suggest a promising upward trend. Optimism (OP) Poised for Breakout: Potential Surge Beyond $3 Resistance Optimism (OP) is showing strong bullish signs, with a monthly gain of over 36%. The current price hovers between $2.38 and $2.87, sitting above both the 10-day and 100-day moving averages. The RSI and Stochastic indicators are above 70, indicating momentum is building. With the nearest resistance at $3.08, a breakthrough could see OP targeting the next level at $3.57. This would represent a significant upside from current levels. The positive MACD also supports continued upward movement. Support is solid at $2.08, suggesting limited downside. With altcoin season on the horizon, OP may be set for substantial gains. Ondo (ONDO) Nears Breakout After Almost Doubling in a Month Ondo (ONDO) has nearly doubled over the past month, showing strong upward momentum. Its current price hovers between $1.24 and $2.04, approaching the resistance at $2.40. A break above this level could target $3.20, potentially adding another 50% gain. The short-term moving average is above the long-term average, indicating a bullish trend. The RSI is above 65 but below 70, suggesting more room for growth before entering overbought territory. With a positive MACD, the bullish momentum may continue. Ondo could see significant gains ahead if the bullish trend persists. NEAR Protocol Eyes Breakout Amid Bullish Momentum NEAR Protocol's price is fluctuating between $6.75 and $8.58, signaling potential upward movement. Over the past month, it has surged nearly 29%, reflecting strong market interest. The next resistance level is at $9.32. Breaking this barrier could propel the price toward the second resistance at $11.14, offering substantial gains. The 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages are trending upwards, reinforcing the bullish outlook. A positive MACD level indicates momentum in favor of buyers. Additionally, the RSI stands above 70, suggesting strong buying pressure. With the crypto market anticipating an altcoin season and a global bull run, NEAR Protocol may continue its ascent if current conditions persist. Conclusion JUP, OP, ONDO, and NEAR offer less short-term potential. DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success. Expected 700% presale growth, with potential for massive returns this altcoin season. Following tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN builds a community of leaders, offering real benefits and perks for early adopters.

37584789,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52045,1734090331,Expert Explains Why He Doubles Down His XRP Position. Do It Before Is Too Late,"In a recent tweet and accompanying video, Crypto investor Oscar Ramos made a compelling case for XRP, urging his audience to double down on their investments before what he predicts will be a transformative period for the cryptocurrency. As a leading figure in the XRP community, Oscar Ramos articulates several arguments supporting XRP’s potential for generational wealth creation, citing political, regulatory, and market-based factors. BECOME an #XRP Maximalist NOW – here’s why I double down my $XRP position. DO IT Before is Too Late – 2025 will be the greatest year in crypto history, guess where XRP will go?! pic.twitter.com/Hh4jtPmyen — Oscar Ramos (@realOscarRamos1) December 12, 2024 A Generational Opportunity in Crypto Oscar Ramos characterizes XRP as a “generational wealth opportunity,” pointing to its unique position in the cryptocurrency market. He underscores XRP’s historical significance as a top-tier asset, highlighting its utility as a token developed by Ripple for cross-border payments and financial efficiency. While Bitcoin often dominates headlines, Oscar Ramos asserts that XRP’s distinct role in enabling seamless global transactions positions it as a standout asset in the crypto space. According to Oscar, the recent price consolidation of XRP around $2.30 to $2.40 reflects a pivotal moment. He expresses confidence that the token’s value could climb to $5 or higher, fueled by increasing adoption, regulatory clarity, and institutional interest. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The Political and Regulatory Landscape A key component of Oscar Ramos’s argument revolves around the changing political and regulatory environment in the United States. Oscar anticipates more crypto-friendly administration and leadership changes at regulatory agencies like the SEC and CFTC. He suggests these developments will foster an environment conducive to innovation and growth in blockchain technology, particularly for companies like Ripple. Additionally, Osacar highlights Ripple’s proactive approach to navigating regulatory challenges. The company has invested millions in legal defenses against the SEC’s lawsuit and lobbying efforts to advance pro-crypto policies. This, he argues, demonstrates Ripple’s commitment to establishing XRP as a cornerstone of the digital financial ecosystem. Market Catalysts and Projections Oscar Ramos also identifies key market catalysts that could drive XRP’s growth. These include the potential launch of ETFs like XRP, increased institutional adoption, and the resolution of ongoing legal uncertainties. He references the precedent set by Bitcoin’s price surge following the approval of ETFs, suggesting a similar trajectory for XRP once its regulatory hurdles are cleared. Price predictions for XRP, according to Oscar, range from $5 to as high as $300 by 2025. While such forecasts are speculative, they align with the community’s optimistic outlook on XRP’s long-term potential. Oscar points to XRP’s market cap relative to Ethereum’s, arguing that it is feasible for XRP to achieve comparable growth. Oscar’s call to action—encouraging individuals to consider XRP as part of their investment portfolio—is a reminder of the high stakes and potential rewards in the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies. Whether XRP will deliver on its promise of generational wealth remains to be seen, but for its advocates, the future looks decidedly bullish.

37585385,https://thecoinrise.com/bank-of-england-seeks-crypto-exposure-details-to-shape-policy/,1734090306,Bank of England Seeks Crypto Exposure Details to Shape Policy,"The Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) has called on businesses to disclose their current and projected exposure to cryptocurrencies by March 2024. This move, outlined in a December 12 statement, aims to monitor financial stability risks while informing the regulator’s approach to crypto-related policies. The PRA’s request extends beyond current holdings, seeking insights into planned crypto activities through September 2029. Firms are also required to detail their adherence to the Basel framework, a global standard for managing risks associated with crypto assets introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in December 2022. “This initiative will help us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures and assess the costs and benefits of various policy options,” the PRA noted. The regulator intends to use this data to evaluate the financial stability implications of cryptocurrencies and their integration into traditional financial systems . Permissionless Blockchains Under Scrutiny A focal point of the PRA’s inquiry revolves around permissionless blockchains. The regulator’s questionnaire highlights concerns such as settlement risks, lack of finality, and potential mismatches between ownership intent and control over authentication mechanisms. While acknowledging potential benefits, the PRA warned that the risks posed by permissionless blockchains remain inadequately mitigated. This classification will stay under review, underscoring the authority’s cautious approach toward integrating decentralized ledger technologies into regulated frameworks. In addition, firms are expected to provide a comprehensive assessment of their crypto strategies, including their use of permissionless blockchains and other decentralized technologies. This marks a significant step in aligning the UK’s regulatory landscape with evolving global standards. Growing Interest in Crypto Treasury Assets As the PRA tightens oversight, global interest in crypto assets continues to surge. Businesses like Hong Kong’s Boyaa Interactive and Japan’s Metaplanet are reallocating treasury assets toward Bitcoin, capitalizing on the cryptocurrency’s recent rally past six figures. Boyaa Interactive recently swapped $50 million worth of Ether for Bitcoin, while Metaplanet announced plans to raise $62 million to expand its Bitcoin holdings. These moves reflect a broader trend of companies leveraging crypto assets for diversification and potential growth, even as regulatory scrutiny intensifies worldwide.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Major Cryptocurrency Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2013 as a lighthearted alternative to Bitcoin, featuring a Shiba Inu dog as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin has no maximum supply, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Initially created as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it gained popularity due to its community and social media influence, notably from figures like Elon Musk. In 2021, Dogecoin experienced a significant surge, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its potential lies in its strong community support and widespread recognition. In the current market cycle, it remains a subject of interest due to these factors. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Growing Utility Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a memecoin inspired by Dogecoin but built on the Ethereum blockchain. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous developer Ryoshi, it started with 1 quadrillion tokens. Half of these were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin donated a significant amount to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, increasing SHIB's visibility. SHIB's Ethereum basis allows for applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and future plans include an NFT platform and DAO-based governance. This integration may enhance its utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB's potential for broader application could make it an attractive option. Conclusion DOGE and SHIB whales are shifting their focus to DOGEN, a new memecoin designed for those seeking luxury and success. DOGEN is expected to grow 700% by the end of the presale, with potential thousand-fold returns during this altcoin season. Following successful tokens like BONK and Popcat, DOGEN is building a community of leaders and offers real benefits for early adopters.

Solana Poised for Growth Amid Bullish Crypto Market Solana (SOL) is showing strong signs of growth. Trading between $219 and $251, it's above both its 10-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling upward momentum. The RSI is nearing overbought territory at 66, reflecting increased buying interest. Breaking past the resistance level around $265 could propel SOL toward the next target near $297. Over the past six months, Solana has surged over 60%. With the anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, SOL may experience significant gains in the near future. Avalanche (AVAX) Targets New Highs Amid Bullish Momentum Avalanche (AVAX) is showing remarkable strength, surging 42.85% in the past month and 68.76% over six months. Trading between $47.46 and $58.23, AVAX is above its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $49.95 and $48.06, signaling a bullish trend. The positive MACD level of 1.27 reinforces this upward momentum. If AVAX breaks the nearest resistance at $62.42, it could rally toward the next resistance at $73.19, potentially delivering gains of over 20% from current prices. With altcoin season approaching and a global crypto bull run anticipated, AVAX might continue its ascent. Chainlink's (LINK) Impressive Surge Sparks Bullish Expectations Chainlink (LINK) has seen impressive growth recently. In the past month, its price jumped 90.34%, and over the last week, it increased by 17.90%. The current price ranges between $20.68 and $29.49. The 10-day simple moving average is $27.33, above the 100-day average of $24.25, indicating upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 80.32, suggesting the asset is overbought. The nearest resistance level is $32.86. If LINK breaks through this, it could target the second resistance at $41.67, potentially gaining around 40%. The strong MACD level of 1.53 supports the bullish trend. Traders are watching to see if Chainlink can sustain this momentum. Polkadot Price Gears Up for Potential Breakout in Anticipated Altcoin Bull Run Polkadot (DOT) is currently trading between $8.66 and $11.90, demonstrating bullish momentum. The coin has surged over 64% in the past month, signaling significant upward movement. With an RSI of 63.19, DOT is nearing overbought levels but still has potential to rise. The nearest resistance is at $13.40; breaching this could push the price toward the next resistance at $16.64, representing a potential gain of around 40% from current levels. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages around $9.20 support the positive trend. A positive MACD level further indicates bullish sentiment. As altcoin season looms, DOT could see considerable growth. Conclusion While SOL, AVAX, LINK, and DOT show promise, their short-term potential is limited. In contrast, DOGEN stands out as a token for those seeking luxury and success. Expected to grow by 700% by the end of the presale, DOGEN may offer thousand-fold returns this altcoin season, building a community of leaders and offering real benefits to early adopters.

37587552,https://coinpaper.com/6534/ukraine-sets-early-2025-deadline-for-cryptocurrency-legalization,1734089437,Ukraine Sets Early 2025 Deadline for Cryptocurrency Legalization,"Australia and Ukraine are making significant strides in regulating the cryptocurrency sector, with both nations unveiling plans to strengthen oversight and introduce comprehensive legal frameworks. While Australia focuses on tightening Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) rules to address financial crime risks, Ukraine is preparing to legalize cryptocurrencies by 2025, aiming to create a transparent regulatory environment for digital assets. Ukraine to Legalize Cryptocurrencies in 2025: A Strategic Move Amid Global Adoption Ukraine is taking decisive steps toward embracing cryptocurrency regulation, with plans to legalize digital assets by early 2025. Daniil Getmantsev, the head of the tax committee of the Verkhovna Rada, announced that a draft bill is under review and is expected to reach parliamentary consideration in the first quarter of 2025. However, unlike some nations that provide tax incentives to foster the crypto sector, Ukraine’s approach will enforce standard taxation rules akin to securities trading. This move positions Ukraine as a potential digital asset hub in Eastern Europe, aligning with global trends to integrate cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems while addressing concerns like fiscal oversight and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. The draft legislation, a collaborative effort between the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), aims to establish a transparent regulatory framework for cryptocurrency transactions. It seeks to ensure financial stability while promoting a legally secure environment for businesses and investors. Getmantsev outlined that the regulatory framework will focus on curbing potential risks associated with money laundering and creating a structured mechanism for taxation. This includes applying capital gains taxes on crypto profits when converted into fiat currencies, aligning with traditional financial practices. The proposed law is part of Ukraine's broader strategy to modernize its financial infrastructure. Given the geopolitical challenges Ukraine faces due to the ongoing conflict with Russia, regulating digital assets could provide citizens with alternative financial tools. Cryptocurrencies have already proven crucial in facilitating humanitarian aid, donations, and financial transactions during wartime disruptions to traditional banking systems. Legalizing cryptocurrencies could have far-reaching implications for Ukraine’s economy. The move aligns with the growing adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) in Eastern Europe, a region that reportedly handled over $499 billion worth of crypto transactions between July 2023 and June 2024, according to Chainalysis. For Ukrainian citizens, cryptocurrencies offer a way to safeguard wealth from inflation, access cross-border transactions, and maintain financial independence amidst economic uncertainty. The legalization framework is expected to attract investment, foster innovation, and position Ukraine as a leader in Eastern Europe’s growing crypto economy. Contrary to industry expectations, Ukraine’s crypto legislation will not include tax incentives. Getmantsev explained that the decision stems from concerns over potential tax evasion risks. Profits from cryptocurrency transactions will be subject to standard capital gains taxes upon conversion to fiat. The committee is, however, still cautious about tax incentives, as they can be exploited in traditional markets, according to Getmantsev. The lack of tax breaks may disappoint some industry players but reinforces Ukraine’s focus on long-term financial sustainability rather than short-term gains. Ukraine’s Move in a Global Context Ukraine’s plans to legalize cryptocurrencies echo broader global efforts to integrate digital assets into regulated financial systems. Countries like Morocco are also taking significant steps toward crypto adoption. Despite banning digital assets in 2017, Morocco’s central bank is now preparing a draft law to legalize cryptocurrencies. Morocco’s central bank governor, Abdellatif Jouahri, announced that the draft law is currently in the adoption process. This comes amidst a surge in Bitcoin interest, particularly as the cryptocurrency nears the $100,000 mark. Morocco is also exploring the potential of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to meet public policy goals. As Ukraine prepares for cryptocurrency legalization, several challenges remain. Ensuring robust AML measures, minimizing tax evasion risks, and addressing public skepticism are critical for the framework’s success. However, the benefits of such regulation—enhanced financial resilience, increased investment, and global competitiveness—are significant. Ukraine’s journey toward crypto legalization is part of a broader trend: the growing recognition of digital assets as integral to modern financial ecosystems. If implemented effectively, this legislation could position Ukraine as a leader in the global crypto landscape while offering its citizens a regulated and secure platform to navigate the digital economy. Australia Proposes Stricter AML/CTF Rules to Reinforce Oversight of Crypto Industry Australia has unveiled a comprehensive plan to enhance its Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (AML/CTF) framework, with a strong focus on tightening regulations in the cryptocurrency sector. The proposed measures, introduced by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (AUSTRAC), aim to bolster oversight of high-risk industries and combat financial crime more effectively. These reforms come in the wake of parliamentary amendments to the AML/CTF Act in November and mark another significant step toward modernizing Australia's approach to financial crime prevention. The updated AML/CTF framework introduces expanded regulatory oversight for high-risk industries, including cryptocurrency exchanges , real estate businesses, and legal services. AUSTRAC’s proposed changes address longstanding regulatory gaps that have allowed illicit activities to thrive in certain sectors. Key components of the reforms include: Stricter Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Businesses will be required to verify customer identities using risk-based processes. This move aims to curb fraudulent transactions and ensure greater transparency. Expanded Reporting Obligations: Enhanced definitions for reporting groups will streamline compliance across industries. Tighter Travel Rule Compliance: The reforms mandate improved adherence to international transfer rules, ensuring transparency in cross-border asset movements. Under these rules, businesses will need to monitor suspicious activities, implement robust internal controls, and maintain transparent reporting mechanisms for cross-border transactions. The cryptocurrency sector, often scrutinized for its vulnerability to financial crime, is a central focus of these reforms. The draft rules are designed to ensure that crypto businesses adopt rigorous compliance measures, including verifying the identities of users and flagging suspicious transactions. AUSTRAC’s task force, established in December, will play a pivotal role in enforcing these standards. The task force will ensure that crypto ATM operators meet stringent compliance standards to prevent the flow of illicit funds. This increased oversight is expected to strengthen Australia’s position as a leader in crypto regulation while fostering a safer environment for digital asset adoption. While the reforms impose stricter rules, they also seek to reduce compliance burdens for businesses. AUSTRAC’s proposal introduces an outcomes-based compliance model, replacing the current prescriptive framework. This approach allows businesses to tailor compliance measures based on their size, structure, and risk profile, ensuring flexibility without compromising regulatory rigor. The AML/CTF General Rule 2025 and the AML/CTF (Exemptions) Rule 2007 have been integrated into the proposal to maintain essential exemptions from the previous regime. Outdated requirements will be removed to streamline processes, providing stability and continuity for businesses adapting to the new regulations. AUSTRAC has opened the draft framework for public consultation, inviting feedback from stakeholders in financial services, cryptocurrency, and legal sectors. The consultation period will run from Dec. 11, 2024, to Feb. 14, 2025. Stakeholders are encouraged to provide feedback on critical aspects, including the practicality of proposed rules, potential compliance challenges, and ways to enhance the framework's effectiveness. Once finalized, the updated regulations will set new benchmarks for AML/CTF compliance in Australia. A Pattern of Increasing Regulatory Focus The proposed reforms are part of a broader trend of heightened regulatory scrutiny on the crypto industry in Australia. Recent initiatives, such as the establishment of AUSTRAC’s crypto ATM task force, signal a growing determination to tackle financial crime in the digital asset space. In addition to these efforts, AUSTRAC has taken decisive action against industry players failing to meet compliance standards. Notably, the Kraken exchange operator was fined $5 million for regulatory breaches earlier this year. Australia’s proposed AML/CTF reforms represent a significant milestone in the country’s regulatory journey. For the cryptocurrency industry, these changes signal a shift toward greater accountability and transparency, which could enhance investor confidence and foster sustainable growth. By addressing vulnerabilities in high-risk sectors, the framework aims to strike a balance between robust oversight and operational flexibility for businesses. The outcomes-based model, in particular, offers a pragmatic approach to compliance, enabling companies to align their practices with specific risk profiles.",POSITIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6534/ukraine-sets-early-2025-deadline-for-cryptocurrency-legalization,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

At this point, the Bank of England (BoE) took action to investigate the risks of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England, through its financial sector regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), has requested companies to report on the risks of cryptocurrencies. The Bank of England's regulatory arm has asked companies to submit detailed reports on their cryptocurrency transactions by March 2025 so it can monitor stability and shape policy. The regulator is also requiring companies to detail their future plans for cryptocurrencies, and specifically their use of permissionless blockchain, by September 2029. The aim of the analyses to be conducted according to the Basel framework is to determine the effects of cryptocurrency markets on financial stability.

These tokens have the potential to deliver returns of up to 1,000 times their current value. This article explores these promising assets and examines why they might be the next big thing in crypto. CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors, positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges including Gate.io, and the listing is planned on December 14th. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Toncoin Eyes Resistance Levels Amid Mixed Price Signals Toncoin is trading between $6.33 and $7.22. In the past month, it gained 18.45%, but it dropped 5.58% over the last week. The Relative Strength Index is at 71.16, suggesting the coin is overbought. The nearest resistance is at $7.65; if Toncoin breaks this, it could rise toward the next level at $8.53, marking a potential increase of around 18%. The Simple Moving Averages for 10 and 100 days are close, indicating a steady trend. However, with a high Stochastic value of 95.21, a price correction might occur. Support levels are at $5.88 and $5. If the price falls below these, it may decline further. Aptos (APT) Eyes Resistance Levels Amid Six-Month Growth Surge Aptos (APT) has surged by 79.40% over the past six months, currently trading between $12.79 and $15.83. The MACD level at 0.50 reflects positive momentum. However, the Relative Strength Index at 76.10 and Stochastic at 79.72 indicate overbought conditions. The nearest resistance level is $17.12; surpassing this could lead to the second resistance at $20.16, representing a potential increase of up to 27%. Conversely, if the price moves downward, the support level at $11.03 may come into play. The coin's Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are $13.57 and $12.85 respectively, showing a relatively stable trend in the short to medium term. JasmyCoin (JASMY) Surges 85% in a Month, Eyes $0.08 Resistance Level JasmyCoin (JASMY) has seen a significant rise, with its price jumping 85.61% in the past month. Currently trading between $0.03 and $0.06, the coin shows signs of continued growth. The nearest resistance level is at $0.08, and overcoming this could lead to the next target at $0.11. Technical indicators support this positive outlook: the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.93, suggesting bullish momentum, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is positive at 0.0008. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages stand at $0.04. If the price holds above the nearest support level of $0.02, JasmyCoin may continue its upward trend. Conclusion TON, APT, and JASMY may offer growth, but their short-term potential is limited. CYBRO stands out as a superior opportunity. As an advanced DeFi platform on the Blast blockchain, CYBRO helps investors maximize earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation. It offers high staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. CYBRO ensures a seamless user experience with easy deposits and withdrawals. With a focus on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted strong interest from major crypto investors and influencers.

Since Donald Trump won the U.S. election on Nov. 5, bitcoin (BTC) has soared from $67,000 to around $100,000. This has coincided with a huge rise in bitcoin's total trade volume which has now surpassed $100 billion.  According to checkonchain data, bitcoin futures trading volume hit an all-time high of around $120 billion on Nov. 17, almost doubling since the U.S. election. However, since then futures trade volume has plateaued and steadied around $100 billion.  The same can be seen with spot trade volume which has also doubled from around $6 billion to $12 billion. While the spot listed U.S. exchange-traded funds (ETF) trade volume has also picked up reaching $4 billion a day.  Bitcoin remains in a key trading range of $100,000, going above and below the key psychological area on multiple occasions. A lot of this has to do with the enormous sell pressure coming from long-term holders (LTH) or investors who have held bitcoin for longer than 155 days.  Since September, LTHs have sold 843,113 BTC. In the same period short-term holders (STHs), those who have held bitcoin for less than 155 days, have accumulated 1,081,633 BTC. This works out to around 9,960 BTC sold by LTHs and STHs accumulating 12,432 BTC per day.  To show the difference of trading volumes between long and short-term holders, we compare them to other big players in the industry, such as the self-described bitcoin development company MicroStrategy (MSTR). MicroStrategy holds 423,650 bitcoin or just over 2% of the total supply. In addition, U.S. ETFs now hold over 1 million bitcoin.   Since September, MicroStrategy has accumulated 197,250 BTC, which works out to roughly 2,168 BTC per day. While, the U.S ETFs have accumulated approximately 205,000 BTC, which works out to 2,253 BTC per day. The U.S. ETF BTC balance has grown from 916,000 BTC to 1.12 million BTC.  In order for bitcoin to conclusively break higher of $100,000 we will need to see LTHs dial down on offloading their tokens or have bigger cohorts enter the space and pick up the buys.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | TRADING,James Van Straten,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/13/larger-cohorts-than-u-s-etfs-or-micro-strategy-are-dictating-bitcoin-price-van-straten,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/0256712fa92e92d8330982f39b51abff38995918-1800x1013.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

A new multichain AI token, priced at just $0.06, is generating excitement with predictions of soaring to $100 after its exchange listing. This potential leap has the crypto community buzzing. Could this be the breakout asset that delivers significant returns? $CYBRO Targets 1000% Growth Post-Listing With $7 Million Raised CYBRO, an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace, is about to hit a major milestone with its Token Generation Event (TGE). After a lightning-fast presale that raised an impressive $7 million and drew in nearly 20,000 investors, CYBRO is now gearing up for its listing on Gate.io and other major exchanges — and it’s happening on December 14th. During the presale, $CYBRO’s price surged 450% from $0.01 to $0.055 in its final stage. Now, with the token set to list at $0.06 on major exchanges, demand is through the roof. Many are predicting a 100x price surge once it hits the open market, thanks to the strong momentum and solid fundamentals backing the project. Join CYBRO Before the Listing Frenzy Drives Prices to the Moon What’s behind the hype? CYBRO combines cutting-edge AI with a user-friendly platform, offering tools like staking, farming, and lending that make DeFi investing accessible to everyone — from cautious newcomers to bold risk-takers. During its short presale CYBRO has already gone a long way in achieving crucial milestones: CYBRO App Launched: Users can now explore around 30 vaults offering competitive annual percentage yields (APY) to match their investment strategies perfectly First One-Click Strategy Introduced: The Blast Index, available in the Vaults list and on the One-Click page, simplifies investing by integrating with lending protocols Rapid Development Progress: CYBRO’s platform has laid the groundwork for seamless DeFi experiences, setting the stage for future growth and innovation. And there’s more to come.

Seize the Chance to Get in Early Before Demand for $CYBRO Skyrockets Solana and SOL: A Scalable Platform for Decentralized Apps Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability and supports apps, competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. It aims for faster transactions through its design and offers flexible development options across multiple programming languages. SOL is Solana's own cryptocurrency and plays a central role in its network. It facilitates transactions, runs custom programs, and rewards supporters. SOL holds value by underpinning Solana's operations, rewarding participants, and giving users access to various projects on the platform. Unlike some platforms, Solana doesn't rely on splitting its network or adding extra layers to improve scalability, aiming to attract developers and investors with its high-capacity network suitable for hosting demanding products and services. Conclusion As the market anticipates significant movements, traditional tokens like SOL may offer limited short-term potential. In contrast, CYBRO offers a compelling opportunity for investors aiming to maximize earnings. Its advanced DeFi platform utilizes AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, enhancing profitability. Features such as attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases provide added value. CYBRO ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals, emphasizing transparency and compliance.

Investor interest rises on Solana memecoins In other news, Lookonchain also highlighted a Solana (SOL) whale’s market activity, who made massive profits by selling memecoin CHILLGUY, a token inspired by the social media meme frenzy “just a chillguy.” Whales/Institutions are accumulating #Defi tokens on #Ethereum ! #GalaxyDigital withdrew 1.07M $UNI ($18.9M) and 27,722 $AAVE ($10.19M) from exchanges today. https://t.co/lD8tgkC4Py pic.twitter.com/xX8yZNIfao — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 13, 2024 The investor initially spent 2,025 SOL to acquire 5.73 million CHILLGUY and later sold them for 9,963 SOL, securing a profit of 7,938 SOL, approximately $1.79 million going by Solana’s current valuation. Over the last 21 days, the same whale has invested $2.75 million in SOL to purchase 8.15 million FARTCOIN, which is now valued at $5.28 million. This leaves the whale with impressive unrealized gains of about $2.53 million.

Report predicts price increases based on institutional buying Sygnum Bank is a crypto-focussed asset manager based in Switzerland. It has recently released a report titled “Crypto Market Outlook 2025”, in which it lays out its forecast that Bitcoin is likely to attract a lot more capital from institutional investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and pension funds, which is likely to act as the major driver for significant price increases in 2025. Sygnum cites a ""multiplier effect” which states that for every $1 billion that goes into the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs, the price has historically risen from 3% to 6%. This multiplier effect is expected by Sygnum to intensify as more institutional investors enter this market. Scarce supply and long-term holders promote price surges The report discusses the unique attributes of Bitcoin, with its incredibly scarce supply of only 21 million BTC to ever be mined, together with the long term holders, acting to continually buoy the price upwards. With the supply being quite inelastic, due to these long term holders, demand surges could lead to considerable appreciation in price. US new crypto-friendly climate The Sygnum Bank report also refers to the new crypto-friendly environment in the US, stating that if pro-crypto policies continue, this would likely help to accelerate the inflow of institutional investment into the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs. In direct relation to this, total inflows to these funds on Thursday amounted to 5.90K BTC, equivalent to $596.60 million. For the week so far, that is a grand total of $1.742 billion. $BTC breakout but diminishing volume Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BTC shows that the price is still respecting the uptrend. A breakout of the triangle occurred, and the price has gone back to test the top of the triangle. However, volume is declining and so a surge from here is not likely unless this changes. Horizontal support (orange line) is gathering strength at $99,000. Monthly RSI shows still some way to go to the top Source: TradingView The macro chart of the monthly time frame is shown with the Relative Strength Index (RSI). This indicates oversold and overbought conditions. Here it can be seen that the indicator line at the bottom of the chart still has some way to go before reaching the descending trendline. The peaks on the RSI accurately show the tops of the previous bull markets, so it might be expected that this will be the case this time.

Amid the ongoing market downturn, bullish outlooks continue to flood the space as proponents expect the market momentum to continue well into 2025. In the latest instance, one analyst has suggested that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could be on the brink of a powerful rally.Shiba Inu Price at a Key LevelAccording to market analyst ""PouyanTradeFX,"" the price of Shiba Inu (SHIB) is at a critical level. In an analysis shared on TradingView on Thursday, PouyanTradeFX opined that SHIB is testing a trendline that has hounded it since 2021. Per a weekly candle chart shared by the analyst, the meme coin first entered this downtrend after it hit its all-time high of $0.00008616 in October 2021 and first revisited it in March 2024 when it surged to a high of $0.00004567.

Source: TradingView According to PouyanTradeFX, SHIB could surge over 150% from current prices around $0.00002795 to highs around $0.000074 if it manages to break this years-long downtrend. On the other hand, the analyst noted that the token risked a 62% free fall to $0.000011 should the trendline hold.PouyanTradeFX is one of many analysts who have shared a bullish outlook on SHIB in the past few days.SHIB Price Set to Erase Another Zero?On Tuesday, December 11, ""Crypto ELITES"" shared an analysis suggesting that SHIB's price could be set to erase another zero. Specifically, the analyst contended that the token's price looked set to surge nearly 1,700% from current prices to about $0.00047905, citing a cup and handle chart pattern on the asset's weekly chart.The analyst noted a key metric that could support this rally is a continued decline in Bitcoin Dominance, signaling a rotation of capital from the digital asset market leader to altcoins and memes. Bitcoin Dominance has fallen sharply from highs of 61.5% in November to 56.5% at the time of writing.The recent bullish views around SHIB come despite its 200% price gain over the past year.",POSITIVE,SHIB,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/13/why-shiba-inu-is-about-to-see-a-powerful-150-rally-to-0-000074-according-to-one-analyst/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=why-shiba-inu-is-about-to-see-a-powerful-150-rally-to-0-000074-according-to-one-analyst,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

Cardano’s 90% Monthly Surge Signals Bullish Momentum Cardano (ADA) has surged over 90% in the past month, highlighting strong bullish momentum. Trading between $1.06 and $1.33, it’s currently above both its 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $1.14 and $1.09. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 72.50 indicates the coin is in overbought territory, reflecting strong buying interest. The nearest resistance is at $1.46; surpassing this could propel the price toward the next resistance at $1.73, an increase of around 20%. With a substantial six-month gain of over 183%, Cardano shows potential for continued growth. However, support levels at $0.92 and $0.65 are key to watch in case of market corrections. XRP Surges: Eyeing $3.30 Resistance Amid Bullish Indicators XRP is trading between $2.22 and $2.95, showing a steady upward trend. Over the past month, its price has skyrocketed by nearly 292%, indicating strong momentum. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are converging around $2.40, supporting the bullish sentiment. With the RSI at 57.64 and Stochastic at 60.32, XRP is neither overbought nor oversold, suggesting room for growth. The next resistance level is at $3.30; breaking this could propel XRP towards $4.03. This represents potential gains of over 35% from current levels. As altcoin season approaches, XRP might be set for significant upside. Conclusion As ADA and XRP show less short-term potential, DOGEN stands out for those seeking excellence, embodying luxury and success. Expected to experience significant growth during the presale and altcoin season, DOGEN follows successful tokens like BONK and Popcat. Building a community of leaders aiming for market dominance, it offers real benefits, including exclusive perks for early adopters.

Analysis Firm Announces Its Prediction!,"Bitcoin (BTC), which experienced a major rally after the election of Donald Trump, recently exceeded the critical threshold of $100,000. While analysts expect the Bitcoin price to continue rising, Matrixport analysts said they expect the Bitcoin price to reach $160,000 by 2025. Matrixport noted that Bitcoin’s recent rally is driven by factors such as rising ETF inflows, increasing institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, speculation, and expanding use cases. “As Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance, it is transforming from a niche asset to a core asset in global financial markets. Market dynamics are changing. Unlike past cycles characterized by sharp -80% declines, Bitcoin’s growing bottom buyers and institutional support base reduce the likelihood of serious corrections. At this point, we predict that Bitcoin could reach $160,000 in 2025, which has a 60% upside potential. This goal aligns with the continued demand for Bitcoin ETFs, the macroeconomic environment, and expanding global liquidity.” Analysts said the outlook for 2025 remains bullish, adding that Bitcoin's proven resilience, role as a hedge against inflation, and integration into institutional portfolios suggest the year ahead will be unique. Matrixport lastly stated that Bitcoin has proven to be a tremendous choice for diversified portfolios in 2024, and said that they recommend a 1.55% allocation in BTC to achieve optimum diversification while maintaining portfolio stability. *This is not investment advice.

37583238,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392733,1734087159,Trump’s US Strategic Crypto Reserve: Will Ethereum Join Bitcoin?,"The post Trump’s US Strategic Crypto Reserve: Will Ethereum Join Bitcoin? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the U.S. looks towards a crypto-driven future, many expect the Donald Trump-led government to create a strategic crypto reserve . While Bitcoin is often seen as the main choice for such a reserve, Ethereum enthusiasts like Vivek Ventures argue that Ethereum will also be a key part of it. Here’s why. The Digital Oil of the Future Vivek, a strong supporter of Ethereum, calls it the “Digital Oil” of the crypto world. He argues that Ethereum is not just important for the growth of the digital economy but also for the global distribution of USD. In his view, any strategic crypto reserve would be incomplete without Ethereum. Reports show that Ethereum secures over $120 billion in tokenized assets and $110 billion in stablecoins. Ethereum’s influence goes far beyond just its native cryptocurrency—its network is central to the entire crypto ecosystem. **A US STRATEGIC CRYPTO RESERVE WILL LIKELY INCLUDE ETHEREUM** There is mounting evidence that a national strategic crypto reserve will include ETH in addition to BTC as its core holdings Here’s why: (1/9) — VivekVentures.eth (@VivekVentures) December 13, 2024 Stablecoins, primarily based on Ethereum, are now major holders of U.S. Treasuries, which highlights Ethereum’s foundational role in the market. Ethereum and Bitcoin Go Together! Vivek emphasizes that the success of Ethereum is essential for wider crypto adoption . While Bitcoin is often called “digital gold,” Ethereum offers exposure to the broader digital economy, supporting decentralized applications, finance, and tokenization. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : President Trump Vows to ‘Do Something Great With Crypto,’ Aims to Position U.S. as Global Head , He points out that Ethereum complements Bitcoin by addressing the limitations of the largest cryptocurrency, making it an essential part of any future crypto reserve. Trump’s Crypto Vision for USA Bringing the spotlight to Trump’s great vision for the cryptocurrency industry, Vivek opines that the US president-elect aims to make the country the crypto capital of the world. Interestingly, he notes that Trump’s crypto portfolio is heavily reliant on ETH, as it is dominated by Ethereum and those tied to Ethereum, like cbBTC, LINK and AAVE. Additionally, he claims that Trump is building a DeFI project centered around Ethereum. Institutions are driving Bitcoin adoption to new heights! Read Bitcoin price prediction to see how this trend could impact future prices. The Year of Ethereum: What’s Next?

37583131,https://finbold.com/?p=219113,1734087049,"How much you’d have if you invested $1,000 in Bitcoin when Bill Gates said he’d short BTC","On December 10, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) made cryptocurrency headlines as its shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a corporate investment in Bitcoin ( BTC ) urged by MicroStrategy’s (NASDAQ: MSTR ) Michael Saylor. In the short term, the decision had little impact on MSFT’s share price, and though it did send BTC plunging, the coin’s downturn was exceedingly short. Though some have taken the vote as a major mistake, few who have been following Microsoft founder Bill Gates would have been surprised as the billionaire has been something of a high-profile Bitcoin bear for years. Indeed, in early May 2018, Gates also made cryptocurrency headlines when he proclaimed he would short BTC if it were possible. How much would have going long when Gates called for shorting returned While the long-term impact of Microsoft shareholders’ decision is yet to be seen, Gates’ own opposition to Bitcoin had been a decisive mistake by press time on December 13, 2024. Specifically, at the time the billionaire made his comment, BTC was trading at $9,373, while the world’s premier cryptocurrency is trading at $100,273 at press time. BTC price chart with early May 2018 price marked. Source: FInbold The 969.8% price difference between May 7, 2018, and December 13, 2024, means that any investor who elected to go long on Bitcoin with a $1,000 investment when Gates called for taking a short position would now have $10,698.07. In other words, they’d have made a profit of $9,068 just by having a dislike for Bill Gates. What will happen to Bitcoin price in 2025? Looking forward, numerous on-chain analysts and the community as a whole estimate that 2025 will bring an even greater upside. Indeed, the press time sentiment dictates that Bitcoin has only dipped its toes in the ongoing bull cycle and that, as major as crossing the $100,000 threshold was, it is but the first step. In recent weeks, $250,000 has emerged as a common price target for BTC in 2025, with many famous investors, authors, and some of the best-regarded Wall Street analysts setting it as a plausible goal. For example, while many might not be surprised that Robert Kiyosaki , author of ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad ’ – and a very consistent and vocal Bitcoin bull – predicted such a climb , it may be more noteworthy that Fundstrat’s Tom Lee recently unveiled the exact same forecast . Should the ambition price target be met, Bill Gates contrarians will have turned their 2018 $1,000 investment into a full $26,672.36 sometime next year.

The project reached an all-time high with a market cap of $561 million on Nov. 27, after the token perpetual contracts was listed on Binance. You might also like: Crypto’s next big thing isn’t meme coins, it’s stablecoins Even though the coin initially saw quite the success, now it is experiencing grave setbacks. The lack of IP rights, coupled with the protest of the founder himself, has many disappointed investors leading to the sell-off spree. The volatile terrain of meme coins Often, meme coins are driven by hype, social media manipulation, and shimmers of community sentiment instead of fundamental value or utility. For instance, Hawk Tuah jumped in viral popularity and then crashed as interest faded, leaving a lot of investors holding the bag. These examples serve to bring out the dangers of the meme coin landscape, which see erratic price movements and controversies, such as that of the ChillGuy IP story, on a near-regular basis. Alex Beene , an instructor at the University of Tennessee at Martin, explained to crypto.news in a LinkedIn direct message that meme coins draw in investors who otherwise might hesitate to enter the crypto market. However, meme coins often come with risks and create mixed perceptions of cryptocurrencies as a whole to people outside the industry. “Meme coins have attracted a wide array of individuals who in past decades typically wouldn’t have been interested in investing in other financial products or services. At the same point, for those who view cryptocurrency like Bitcoin as true store of value, it’s difficult to read headlines on the absurdities in the meme coin ecosystem and not feel like it’s devaluing the wider crypto community. Simply put, it’s a mixed bag of perceptions.” —Alex Beene Read more: MEXC unlocks new benefits for MX holders as price climbs nearly 50% within a month",NEGATIVE,SOL,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | SOL | TRADING,,0,0,crypto.news,https://crypto.news/chillguy-memecoin-down-45-amid-ip-rights-violation/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/37583133.jpeg

Following a fresh breakup, it currently appears strong on a daily scale. Aave’s general market outlook appears bullish on the macro level, and as we can see on the daily chart, the trend is becoming stronger daily since the price bounced back from $70 in July. Although there was a little drawback this week after facing a rejection last weekend, the price plunged on Monday and tested a low of $225. This low held as support, and the price recovered well above $270 the following day. Breaking higher yesterday, the price now sits at $351. Strong price actions can be expected while the bulls are back in control. A drop from the current trading level should bring a retest at $300 before rallying hard. As it stands, there’s no room for the bears. The steady rise in the daily volume indicator suggests more growth is underway. Looking back from where it bounced back, Aave’s price has increased by 5x, and from the looking of things, huge returns lie ahead following the latest breakout. A huge capital inflow could propel the price near $1k by the end of this bull cycle. Aave’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Towards the upside, the potential level for a test is $395. An increase above this level should propel buying to $455. The next key level to keep in mind is $500. If a pullback occurs, the $297.2 level is the closest support to watch for a test. There is also support at $261 in case of a more drag down. Below it lies $225 tested as the low of the week. Key Resistance Levels: $395, $455, $500 Key Support Levels: $297.2, $261, $225 Spot Price: $351 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Announcing the news on December 12 via an X post, Caruso described her vision for Topology as supporting founders who “put everything on the line to bend the arc of human progress.” Topology: A Bold New Venture The $75 million funding round was led by Cendana Capital and Accolade Partners, with notable contributions from influential backers, including Marc Andreessen and Chris Dixon of Andreessen Horowitz, a co-creator of GPT-4, and Bessemer Venture Partners’ managing partner, Bob Goodman. Even American celebrity and tech investor Paris Hilton joined the roster of supporters, further underscoring the firm’s star-studded backing. Caruso, who worked at Paradigm from May 2021 to January 2023, has a deep history in crypto investments. At Paradigm, she was involved in high-profile investments, including Coinbase, Uniswap, and MakerDAO. Her eight-year investing track record also spans futuristic technologies like brain-computer interfaces, decentralized protocols, and innovative urban designs. A Unique Journey to Venture Capital Leadership Caruso’s journey to launching Topology is as unconventional as it is inspiring. She began writing open-source software at the age of 15 and mined cryptocurrency while still in school, using her earnings to embark on angel investing. Her career path includes roles as a crypto specialist at Bessemer Venture Partners, an engineer at Google, and a brief stint at Harvard University studying neuroengineering before leaving to focus on venture capital. Topology, which operated in stealth mode for seven months before its official launch, is laser-focused on early-stage companies, an area that continues to dominate crypto venture funding despite an overall decline. According to Galaxy Research, crypto VC funding dropped by 17% in Q3 2023, with $2.4 billion raised across 478 deals. However, early-stage startups accounted for 85% of these investments, indicating sustained interest in nurturing foundational projects.

Meanwhile, Coinbase plans to delist Tether's USDT and five other stablecoins to comply with the EU's MiCA regulations, which raises some questions about USDT's compliance status. Additionally, Circle and Binance announced a partnership to promote USDC adoption, while Ripple's RLUSD stablecoin received NYDFS approval earlier this week. This positions RLUSD as a competitor to USDT and USDC. Ethena’s USDe Surpasses Dai in Market Cap Ethena's decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol recently hit a major milestone after its stablecoin, USDe, overtook Sky's Dai (DAI) in total market capitalization. This positions USDe as the third-largest stablecoin in the market, trailing only Tether's USDt (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). Top stablecoins by market cap (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to data from DefiLlama , USDe has a market capitalization of just under $6 billion, which is still far behind USDt's $140 billion and USDC's $41 billion. Dai, the flagship stablecoin of Sky, saw its market cap shrink to around $4.5 billion, down from over $7 billion in 2022. USDe’s growth is fueled by Ethena's innovative CeDeFi yield strategy, which merges DeFi smart contracts with centralized exchange derivatives trading. This approach attracted billions of dollars since USDe’s launch in February, offering double-digit annual percentage yields (APYs) to stablecoin holders. As of Dec. 12, staked USDe, or sUSDe, provides an APY of around 27%. Yields peaked at 55.9% earlier in the year. (Source: DeFiLlama ) Ethena makes it possible for users to mint USDe by depositing tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, liquid staking tokens, and other stablecoins. The protocol mitigates portfolio volatility through offchain financial derivatives, deriving yield from staked assets, funding spreads, and futures markets. While Ethena’s CeDeFi strategy drove rapid adoption, it still carries inherent risks, including potential failures of offchain exchanges and custodians. Despite these challenges, USDe experienced remarkable growth. Leading crypto trading desk Wintermute started accepting USDe as trading collateral in October. In June, sUSDe integrated with DeFi lending giant Aave, and very quickly became the platform’s fastest-growing asset. ENA price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Ethena’s success also extends beyond just its stablecoin. The protocol generated approximately $200 million in fees in 2024. Additionally, Ethena’s native token, ENA , surged by 5x since June. On the other hand, Sky's rebranding from Maker and its changes to Dai that was renamed USDS, attracted a lot of criticism over cybersecurity concerns and potential asset freezes. Coinbase to Remove Tether and Five Other Stablecoins Although USDT is still the leader in the stablecoin world, cryptocurrency exchanges across Europe are preparing to delist stablecoins that do not meet compliance standards under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA). Coinbase Europe, Coinbase Germany, and Coinbase Custody International announced plans to delist Tether’s USDT and five other stablecoins, including PAX, PYUSD, GUSD, GYEN, and DAI, starting Dec. 13. The delisting is part of Coinbase’s effort to comply with MiCA, which has been partially in effect since June 30 and will be fully enforced by Dec. 30. Despite these restrictions, Coinbase will continue supporting USD Coin (USDC) and the euro-pegged EURC stablecoin. Coinbase is ranked as the third-largest global exchange by trading volumes, and has a very large share of USDT trading. In fact, the stablecoin accounts for more than 12% of all trades on its platform. While the decision to delist noncompliant stablecoins aligns with regulatory demands, Coinbase stated that it may reassess and re-enable services for stablecoins that achieve MiCA compliance in the future. Top cryptos traded by Coinbase (Source: CoinGecko ) The legal status of USDT under MiCA is still uncertain . The European Securities and Markets Authority still has to clarify whether USDT is actually noncompliant, which leaves room for further discussions. Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, criticized certain aspects of MiCA and revealed that Tether is developing a technology-based solution that is tailored for the European market. In November, Tether suspended its euro-backed stablecoin EURt due to limited market interest. EURt’s market cap represented only 0.02% of USDT’s value. Despite facing regulatory challenges, Tether is still committed to the European market. The company is supporting new MiCA-compliant stablecoins, including EURq and USDq. Circle and Binance Forge Strategic Partnership Circle and Binance recently announced a strategic partnership that is aimed at advancing the financial services ecosystem and the global development of digital assets. The collaboration was unveiled during Abu Dhabi Finance Week, and will see Binance adopting Circle’s USDC into its corporate treasury and expanding its availability on the exchange. This includes introducing more USDC trading pairs, special promotions, and integration into various Binance products. Circle will support Binance with technology and liquidity, while also assisting in building connections in global finance and commerce. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire believes that stablecoin adoption is central to the future financial system Binance aims to create. During the event, Circle also announced it incorporated an entity in the Abu Dhabi Global Market and revealed a partnership with LuLu Financial Holdings . This collaboration was formed to facilitate remittances and cross-border payments using USDC. LuLu Financial handles more than $10 billion in annual transactions across the Gulf Cooperation Council, the Indian subcontinent, and the Asia-Pacific region. Looking ahead, Circle plans to relocate its headquarters to New York in early 2025 and proceed with an initial public offering (IPO) once the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) grants its approval. Circle filed for the IPO in January of 2024. NYDFS Approves Ripple’s RLUSD The stablecoin industry also attracted a lot of attention this past week after Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse announced that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) approved the company’s RLUSD stablecoin after months of review. In a Dec. 10 social media post, Garlinghouse stated that Ripple will soon reveal exchange and partner listings for RLUSD after it received the regulatory green light. Ripple first announced plans for the stablecoin earlier this year in April. The stablecoin will be a competitor to Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. The company also plans for RLUSD to potentially reach a $2 trillion market capitalization by 2028. Testing for RLUSD started in August on both the XRP Ledger and Ethereum mainnets. Ripple also started announcing partnerships in October with exchanges like Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, and Bullish. The stablecoin will be pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar and backed by USD deposits, short-term U.S. Treasury bonds, and other cash equivalents. According to Ripple executives, RLUSD will complement XRP, and will focus on institutional players rather than retail users. The approval was given despite Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. SEC over the classification of XRP token offerings. Garlinghouse also recently appeared on a 60 Minutes segment to discuss the role of cryptocurrency in shaping the 2024 U.S. elections.",POSITIVE,USDT | USDC,EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | USDT | USDC,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6529/ethena-s-ce-de-fi-strategy-drives-us-de-to-outpace-sky-s-dai,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

37582641,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=26353,1734086040,Bitcoin Approaches All-Time Highs as Whale Activity Increases,"Bitcoin neared its all-time highs on Dec. 12, coming within 1% as whales absorbed sell-side liquidity. BTC Price Comeback Targets Record Levels Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD climbing back to $102,000 following the Wall Street opening bell. This recovery built on the previous day’s momentum, which saw Bitcoin gain nearly $5,000 in a single green daily candle. Material Indicators, a trading analytics platform, highlighted the role of high-volume traders in the latest rally. “FireCharts binned CVD shows that whales are back to making whale-sized market orders,” the platform noted in an X post. “Now that BTC has reached deeper concentrations of ask liquidity, whales can make those larger market orders without the slippage they would have endured over the previous 2 days when price was moving through a range with thinner liquidity.” An accompanying chart illustrated whale activity and liquidity shifts for the BTC/USDT pair on Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. Sell-Side Pressure and Market Dynamics Despite the bullish surge, popular trader Skew observed that sell-side pressure remained significant enough to limit Bitcoin’s upward potential. “As long as passive buyers continue to slurp we break up eventually,” Skew remarked to followers on X. Meanwhile, The Bitcoin Researcher struck a cautious tone, emphasizing the need for a reset in short-term holder (STH) profitability to sustain price growth. Using the market value to realized value (MVRV) metric for STHs—entities holding BTC for up to 155 days—the account explained: “I’d like to see the Short-Term Holder MVRV return closer to its baseline. A rising price without STH-MVRV reset often signals an impending market top—rarely sustainable for long. Reset or not, both outcomes provide clear, but opposite, on-chain signals.”",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING | BNB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/bitcoin-approaches-all-time-highs-as-whale-activity-increases/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png
42415810,a452d339-c2b3-4665-ba45-5436597ce3ec,1734085905,Miners Are Adopting the Same Bitcoin Acquisition Strategy as MicroStrategy: JPMorgan,"MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software company founded by Michael Saylor, is not the only large-scale corporate buyer of bitcoin (BTC), JPMorgan (JPM) said in a Wednesday report. Crypto miners are also adopting the accumulation strategy.   The shift to building up bitcoin holdings is driven by growing pressure on profitability,  which stems from the reward halving in April and a rising network hashrate, the report said. Hashrate is the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.  ""This likely prompted miners to hoard or seek further investments into bitcoin or diversify into AI/HPC businesses,"" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote, referring to artificial intelligence and high-performance computing.  Miners such as MARA Holdings (MARA) have adopted a similar bitcoin-buying strategy to MicroStrategy, called BTC yield, in response to these challenges, JPMorgan said.  MARA now owns 35,000 tokens ($3.5 billion) and is the second-largest publicly listed corporation in terms of bitcoin holdings.  The miners aren't alone. Medical-device maker Semler Scientific has also been actively buying the world's largest cryptocurrency, and now owns $144 million worth of crypto.  January's introduction of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. has given institutional investors a more direct way to gain bitcoin exposure, the bank said. Shares of miners, which had been treated as a proxy for bitcoin, have underperformed as a result.  The bank noted that aside from buying more bitcoin, miners are increasingly financing their businesses via debt and equity offerings rather than selling their crypto reserves to cover operational costs.  Miners have raised more than $10 billion in equity so far this year, eclipsing the previous high of $9.5 billion in 2021, the report added.

37582507,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662045,1734085816,"Australia’s Biggest Pension Fund Makes Historic $17M Bitcoin Investment, A National First","In a groundbreaking move for the Australian pension industry, AMP Ltd., a prominent pension and wealth management firm, has allocated approximately A$27 million (around $17.2 million) to Bitcoin (BTC) futures. This investment marks AMP as one of the first major retirement managers in Australia to embrace cryptocurrency products, reflecting a shift in attitudes toward digital assets within a traditionally conservative sector. AMP’s Bitcoin Futures Investment AMP’s Senior Portfolio Manager, Steve Flegg, announced the decision on LinkedIn, noting that the firm “took the plunge and made a modest allocation to Bitcoin” earlier this year. A corporate representative told Bloomberg that the investment was primarily in Bitcoin futures and that there are currently no intentions to raise this commitment. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Surges 14% In A Day: Is An additional 180% Rally Within Reach? The move comes after BTC recently reached the $100,000 barrier for the first time, rising by more than 40% since Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election in November. Trump, known for his pro-crypto position, has vowed to create a more favorable regulatory environment for digital-asset enterprises, hence increasing interest in cryptocurrencies, and has proposed the establishment of a national Bitcoin stockpile. Despite AMP’s pioneering steps, the broader Australian pension sector, valued at A$4.1 trillion, has shown limited enthusiasm for cryptocurrency investments. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Michele Bullock has stated that Bitcoin does not play a significant role in the Australian economy. Furthermore, regulators have cautioned that robust risk management practices must be employed when engaging with digital assets. The Australian pension industry has faced scrutiny over various issues, including valuation concerns in unlisted markets, customer service, and investment fees. Recently, many pension products offered by AMP failed an annual performance test designed to identify underperforming retirement products, with several failing for a second consecutive year. Crypto ETFs Fuel AMP’s Investment Strategy The decision to invest in Bitcoin futures is indicative of the “structural changes” occurring within the digital-assets landscape, according to AMP’s Chief Investment Officer, Anna Shelley. She pointed to the recent launch of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US that invest directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) by leading investment managers as a significant development. “Following testing and careful consideration by our investment team and committee, we included a small and risk-controlled position in digital assets through our Dynamic Asset Allocation program in May,” Shelley explained.

While AMP acknowledges the potential benefits of exposure to cryptocurrencies, the firm remains acutely aware of the associated risks and volatility. Shelley noted that although their superannuation members have gained from this exposure, the investment is part of a highly diversified asset mix and will be managed with careful oversight. At the time of writing, the market’s leading crypto is trading at $99,800, recording a slight 1.1% decrease in the 24-hour time frame.

37582490,https://crypto.news/?p=14319064,1734085799,Forecasts show SOL and Lightchain AI could explode: Here’s why,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana and Lightchain AI lead blockchain solutions in 2024, with analysts eyeing Solana’s growth and Lightchain’s AI integration as game-changers. Table of Contents The momentum behind Solana in 2024 Lightchain AI: The rising star Key features driving growth Price factors for 2024: Solana vs. Lightchain AI What analysts are saying Investor opportunities Who’s the blockchain champ of 2024? The cryptocurrency market is no stranger to wild growth and surprising trends. As blockchain innovation continues to soar in popularity, two names are stealing the spotlight for 2024: Solana (SOL) and Lightchain AI (LCAI) . Both are pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology, but they each chart a very different course. Solana has solidified itself as a high-speed, high-performance blockchain, while Lightchain AI is shaking things up by merging blockchain with artificial intelligence (AI), a game-changing combination. So, why are analysts so excited? In this article, we’ll dive into why both Solana and Lightchain AI are poised for explosive growth. The momentum behind Solana in 2024 Where Solana stands today Solana has earned its place as a blockchain powerhouse, known for scalability and ultra-low transaction costs. Its unique Proof of History (PoH) combined with Proof of Stake (PoS) lets it handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS). This makes Solana a favorite for decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and blockchain gaming. What’s next for Solana? Analysts are buzzing with optimism for Solana’s potential in 2024: Bullish projections: Some predict Solana could climb to $300-$500 by the end of next year, fueled by: A growing number of DeFi protocols on its network. Continued leadership in the NFT space. Big-name partnerships with financial giants and tech leaders. The Roadblocks: While Solana’s future looks bright, challenges like occasional network outages and concerns over centralization could slow its momentum. As Solana powers forward, all eyes are on how it overcomes these obstacles to maintain its edge in the fast-evolving blockchain race. Lightchain AI: The rising star The unique value proposition Unlike Solana, which is primarily focused on transaction speed and cost-efficiency, Lightchain AI is pioneering the integration of artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. By introducing features like Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI is creating a new standard for blockchain use cases. Predictions for 2024 Analysts see significant growth potential for Lightchain AI: Presale momentum: Starting at $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI’s presale has already raised over $1.27 million, signaling strong investor interest. Growth potential: Experts estimate that the token could reach $5-$10 by the end of 2024 as its ecosystem gains traction across multiple industries, including healthcare, supply chain, and finance. You might also like: How Lightchain AI combines AI solutions with blockchain tech Key features driving growth 1. Proof of Intelligence vs. Proof of History Solana’s PoH: While innovative when introduced, PoH focuses solely on transaction validation through timestamping, making it efficient but limited in scope. Lightchain AI’s PoI: PoI takes a giant leap forward by rewarding nodes for performing meaningful AI computations, such as machine learning and data optimization. This approach adds real-world utility to the blockchain while maintaining security and scalability. 2. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) Lightchain AI’s AIVM is a computational layer designed specifically for AI tasks, allowing developers to build smarter, more adaptive decentralized applications (dApps). Solana’s infrastructure, in contrast, is primarily optimized for traditional DeFi and NFT applications. 3. Transparency and governance Solana: Limited governance participation due to concerns over validator centralization. Lightchain AI: A community-driven governance model empowers token holders to shape the platform’s future, fostering trust and inclusivity. 4. Energy efficiency Solana’s energy consumption is moderate but not optimized for sustainability. Lightchain AI’s PoI mechanism eliminates wasteful computations, making it one of the most eco-friendly blockchain platforms. Price factors for 2024: Solana vs. Lightchain AI Market dynamics Solana: Demand drivers: Solana’s ecosystem growth and partnerships with mainstream brands. Risks: Dependence on speculative activity in DeFi and NFTs, along with ongoing technical challenges. Lightchain AI: Demand drivers: Adoption across multiple industries, fueled by its AI-powered applications. Risks: As a new entrant, Lightchain AI must build a robust developer and user community to ensure sustained growth. You might also like: Chainlink vs. Lightchain AI: A race to redefine the blockchain landscape What analysts are saying On Solana Analysts appreciate Solana’s high throughput and rapidly expanding ecosystem, which has attracted a diverse range of projects from DeFi to NFTs. Its ability to process thousands of transactions per second and its low fees have made it a popular choice among developers and users alike. However, concerns remain over its scalability and overreliance on the DeFi sector, which exposes it to risks if the market contracts. Additionally, its history of network instability and questions about its level of decentralization have led some to question its long-term viability. “Solana’s ability to maintain its current momentum will depend on resolving its network instability and addressing decentralization concerns,” notes a leading blockchain expert. Improving these areas could solidify its position as a dominant blockchain platform. On Lightchain AI Experts view Lightchain AI as a forward-looking project with the potential to redefine how blockchain technology is applied across industries. By seamlessly integrating AI into its core infrastructure, Lightchain AI is paving the way for innovative use cases that extend beyond traditional blockchain functions. These include personalized financial services, predictive analytics for supply chains, and intelligent automation in healthcare and manufacturing. Its focus on harnessing the power of AI gives it a unique edge in the competitive blockchain space. “By integrating AI into its core infrastructure, Lightchain AI is creating opportunities across industries that no other blockchain has fully explored,” says a blockchain and AI analyst. If successful, this approach could set a new standard for blockchain innovation. Investor opportunities Solana’s upside Short-Term potential: Solana could experience further price surges as new projects join its ecosystem. Long-Term risks: Without significant technological innovation, Solana risks being overshadowed by newer platforms like Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI’s promise Early investment advantage: At $0.003 per token, Lightchain AI offers significant upside potential for early adopters. Scalability and versatility: Its ability to cater to diverse industries positions it as a long-term contender in the blockchain market. Who’s the blockchain champ of 2024? Solana and Lightchain AI are gearing up for 2024, but they’re playing two very different games. Solana’s got the street cred with its thriving DeFi and NFT scene, but it’s still wrestling with network hiccups and questions about decentralization. Can it stay in the fast lane? Time will tell. On the flip side, Lightchain AI is coming in hot with a futuristic blend of blockchain and AI. With features like Proof of Intelligence and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine, it’s not just thinking outside the box, it’s building a whole new one.

37582384,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392716,1734085574,XRP News: Will XRP Drop to $1.50? Analyst Predicts Further Crash,"The post XRP News: Will XRP Drop to $1.50? Analyst Predicts Further Crash appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP, which reached a high of $2.90 this December, is now facing the possibility of a significant price decline. The well-known market analyst, The Block Bull , has warned that XRP could see a major drop in the next few weeks. After losing its upward momentum, the coin appears to be in a correction phase, with predictions suggesting it could fall to $1.50—or even lower. XRP Price Takes a Hit According to The Block Bull , XRP’s downward trend might have already begun. On December 12, the coin fell by 2.34%, ending a small winning streak. While XRP has shown some signs of recovery since then, the analyst believes it could drop to $1.50 by next week. My theory is XRP is done with its consolidation from tomorrow and will begin its descent. Bitcoin will correct 30-35% from 19th December. I wouldn’t be surprised if $XRP is $1.50 next week and then eventually 50cent between Xmas and new year. — BLOCK BULL (@TheBlockBull) December 12, 2024 Even if XRP reaches $1.50, it may not hold. If the coin drops below this level, the price could plummet to $0.50, possibly during the holiday season. XRP struggled to stay above $0.50 for a long time before finally breaking past it in late 2024. This makes $1.50 a critical level to watch. Whale Activity Raises Concerns In addition to the price decline, Coinpedia reported that 39.43 million XRP tokens , worth about $95.5 million, were recently moved to Coinbase. This follows worries about crypto whales potentially dumping nearly $100 million worth of XRP, which could further impact the price. Mid-Term Outlook for XRP Despite a big 105% rally over the past eight days, the coin dropped sharply due to the overall weak XRP had a 105% rally over the past eight days, but it quickly dropped due to the overall weak state of the crypto market. Bitcoin’s struggle to stay above $100,000 has created uncertainty, causing XRP to become stuck in a price range rather than pushing higher. The analyst believes that if XRP doesn’t break out of this range soon, things could get worse. The mid-term outlook remains bearish, with the possibility of the coin dropping back to its November lows. Recent sell-offs have led to over $1 billion in liquidations, which signals that much of the speculative excess is being cleared. While this has pushed the price down, it could also indicate that the market is correcting itself. Curious about XRP’s next move? Read XRP price prediction and discover where the market might be headed in the coming weeks! Hope for XRP in the Long Run? Despite the negative outlook, some XRP supporters are hopeful. They are looking to Ripple’s upcoming RLUSD stablecoin launch and the potential for better regulatory conditions under the new U.S. administration as possible factors that could help XRP recover. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.34, reflecting a 4% drop in the last 24 hours. Its market cap stands at $132.93 billion, showing the ongoing volatility in the market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Despite increased price fluctuations near the $100,000 mark, Bitcoin maintains an overall optimistic trend. Currently, Bitcoin is trading at $100,053, just shy of the $2 trillion market cap.Technical setups indicate underlying bullish sentiment, suggesting a potential breakout rally.Bitcoin Price AnalysisOn the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin's price trend shows a bullish breakout from a triangle pattern. However, the rally failed to surpass the critical local resistance at $101,642.The supply zone now serves as the neckline of a bullish setup. Bitcoin's price action is forming an inverted head-and-shoulder pattern and is currently in the process of forming the right shoulder. Bitcoin price chart The minor pullback during the formation of the right shoulder is seen as a retest of the previously broken resistance trendline. With the bullish setup and the post-retest reversal potential, the sentiment remains optimistic.This minor pullback has led to a convergence of the MACD and signal line, warning of a potential bearish crossover. However, key dynamic support levels, such as the 20 EMA on the 4-hour chart, are observing a surge in supply.BlackRock Purchases $431.6M Worth of Bitcoin, ETF Inflows Hit $597.57MDespite the minor pullback, institutional support continues to grow. On December 12, the total net inflow of U.S. Bitcoin ETFs reached $597.57 million. The main character in the buying spree remains BlackRock, with an inflow of $431.60 million. Following BlackRock, Grayscale's mini Bitcoin ETF accumulated $110.76 million worth of Bitcoin, while GBTC sold off $48.40 million.Bullish Setup Targets $107kThe 4-hour candle shows a 0.32% recovery, hinting at a potential reversal. If the inverted head-and-shoulder pattern breaks out bullishly, Bitcoin’s price could reach a new all-time high, surpassing the $103,102 level or the 38.20% Fibonacci retracement.Based on the technical setup, the bull run could target $107,777. However, resistance around the 50% Fibonacci level at $106,912 may act as an intermediary target.On the flip side, if there's an extended pullback, the 23.60% Fibonacci level at $98,369 will be a key support level.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,The Crypto Basic,https://thecryptobasic.com/2024/12/13/bitcoin-eyes-breakout-rally-to-107k-amid-597m-etf-inflows/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bitcoin-eyes-breakout-rally-to-107k-amid-597m-etf-inflows,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png

When Will It Stop? Here are the Renowned Economist’s Predictions,"The Fed will be cautious about cutting interest rates in 2025 and will pause its quantitative easing cycle after June, according to Comerica Bank chief economist Bill Adams. Speaking at a finance panel, Adams outlined his predictions by suggesting the Fed will cut rates twice in 2025, in March and June, before adopting a “wait and see” approach for the rest of the year. “The Fed signaled at its September meeting that they are looking to lower interest rates to a less restrictive level,” Adams said, noting that inflation has slowed to between 2.5% and 3%, but is still above the 2% target. That, combined with broader economic stability, reduces the need for interest rates to remain around 5%, he said. Related News: Turkey's SEC Announced the List - Blocked Access to Cryptocurrency Exchanges with Very Familiar Names Adams also pointed to external factors influencing the Fed's cautious stance, including the prospect of a new round of fiscal stimulus and potential upward pressure on goods prices due to higher tariffs in 2025. These dynamics could leave U.S. interest rates just below 4% by the end of 2025, with Comerica setting its neutral rate at 2.5% to 3%. The Fed’s potential break comes after a period of easing financial conditions and resilient market performance. While inflation has been tempered by lower goods prices and modest wage growth, concerns remain about the sustainability of these trends. *This is not investment advice.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-explode-16000-before-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-fall/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

With hundreds of options on the market, how do you decide which projects have staying power and which are just fleeting hype? Today, we’re diving into Qubetics, Arbitrum, and Cardano—three projects that analysts and investors can’t stop talking about. Each promises something unique, but which one deserves a spot in your portfolio as one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term ? The Qubetics Revolution: Solving What Others Couldn’t Cryptocurrency has come a long way, but it’s still plagued by critical issues like lack of privacy, dependency on third parties, and regulatory hurdles. Enter Qubetics ($TICS)—a project designed to tackle these real-world problems head-on. Imagine a non-custodial wallet that ensures complete control over your funds, enhanced security, and zero reliance on middlemen. That’s Qubetics in a nutshell. Not convinced yet? Just look at the numbers. Qubetics has raised over $5.7 million in its 12th presale stage, with more than 313 million $TICS already sold. At $0.0311 per token, it’s attracting over 8,700 holders who believe in its mission. Analysts predict its price could soar to $10-15 after the mainnet launch. Think about it—a $1,000 investment today could grow into $480,000 if Qubetics hits its upper target. Let’s crunch some numbers. Say you invest $1,000 in Qubetics at its current presale price of $0.0311. With analysts predicting a price of $10-15 post-launch, your investment could grow exponentially. Compare this to Arbitrum and Cardano, where price growth is tied to broader market trends rather than groundbreaking innovation. Why Qubetics Stands Out Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet isn’t just a fancy feature; it’s a necessity in a world where financial privacy is under attack. Traditional wallets often force you to rely on third parties, making your assets vulnerable to hacking, government overreach, or even loss due to negligence. Qubetics eliminates these risks. Moreover, regulatory concerns are a growing headache for crypto investors. From abrupt bans to freezing of funds, the industry’s lack of clarity scares off many. Qubetics’ decentralised and open-source model puts you in control, letting you sleep easier at night. It’s no surprise that excitement is building around this project. With its innovative tech and jaw-dropping presale success, Qubetics is a frontrunner in the race for the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term. For better guidance, please watch this video . Arbitrum: A Platform for the Future of Decentralised Applications Now, let’s talk about Arbitrum. Known for its scalability and low transaction fees, Arbitrum is a Layer 2 solution built on Ethereum, aiming to make decentralised apps (dApps) more accessible. Arbitrum has recently teamed up with Ubisoft to launch Captain Laserhawk: The G.A.M.E., bringing blockchain gaming to mainstream audiences. This partnership signals a broader trend of traditional industries embracing crypto technology. For investors, Arbitrum offers a chance to ride the wave of innovation in gaming, NFTs, and beyond. But does it compare to Qubetics? Not quite. While its use cases are exciting, Arbitrum’s value largely depends on Ethereum’s ecosystem. This dependency can be a double-edged sword, especially if Ethereum faces scalability or regulatory challenges. Cardano: A Comeback Story? Cardano ($ADA) is another contender in the altcoin arena. Known for its scientific approach to blockchain technology, it has been a favourite among long-term investors. Recent market activity shows signs of a rebound, with Cardano and XRP leading the charge in market recoveries. Cardano’s strength lies in its community-driven development and focus on sustainability. It’s one of the few projects actively pursuing environmentally friendly blockchain solutions. However, critics argue that its slow development pace and fierce competition from faster networks like Solana make it less appealing for immediate returns. Still, Cardano has a dedicated fan base and a history of resilience. For those who believe in its vision, it’s a solid pick for the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term. The Final Word When it comes to picking the best altcoins to buy and hold for the long term, Qubetics ticks all the boxes. Its focus on solving real-world issues, combined with an ambitious roadmap and community support, makes it a standout. Arbitrum and Cardano are strong contenders, but neither offers the same level of innovation or growth potential. If you’re looking to make an impact in your portfolio, Qubetics is the clear winner.

Researchers at the venture firm Electric Capital note that 39,148 new developers explored the crypto space in 2024. The firm also says that 2024 was the first year since 2016 that any ecosystem besides Ethereum ( ETH ) ranked first among the new developer cohort, with 7,625 new devs choosing Solana, compared to 6,456 for Ethereum. Solana also leads in terms of decentralized exchange (DEX) usage, capturing 81% of DEX transactions and ranking the highest in terms of the number of unique trading wallets. Base, Coinbase’s Ethereum layer-2 scaling solution, ranked second in unique trading wallets. Ethereum still remains the top ecosystem for development overall, ranking number one across every continent. Solana ranked second. Electric Capital says developer numbers are a “leading indicator of value creation.” “Developers build apps that deliver value to users. Killer apps attract customers. New customers bring more developers. Because crypto is significantly open source, we have an unprecedented ability to measure this developer-value creation flywheel in a rapidly evolving industry.” Solana’s native asset, SOL, is trading at $227.70 at time of writing. The 5th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down more than 3% in the past 24 hours.

However, selling pressure forced BTC below $100,000, with the cryptocurrency down 1.24% and trading at $99,750. The crash earlier in the week liquidated over 100,000 traders, leading to a total of $298.5 million in total liquidations. The crypto market cap, which registered a dramatic increase when markets recovered, is down by 1.33% and currently sits at $3.6 trillion. Most cryptocurrencies have started the day in the red, with Ethereum (ETH) down marginally and trading just below $4,000. Solana (SOL) is down by 1.36% and trading at $227, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is down almost 2% and trading at $0.408. Notable declines have also been registered by Cardano (ADA) , Shiba Inu (SHIB), Toncoin (TON), and Polkadot (DOT). However, Avalanche (AVAX) and Chainlink (LINK) have defied the broader market, registering gains of 5.97% and 10.90%. Japanese Lawmaker Proposes National Bitcoin Reserve A Japanese lawmaker has asked the government to create a national Bitcoin reserve, following similar calls by lawmakers in Argentina and Russia. Satoshi Hamada, an MP from the Party to Protect the People from NHK, made the proposal. Hamada presented a written request to the Japanese government regarding the creation of a reserve for cryptocurrencies. The lawmaker pointed out similar plans have been proposed in Brazil and the United States, where Treasury officials could hold Bitcoin (BTC) as a strategic reserve. The lawmaker asked the government to consider converting part of its foreign exchange reserves into cryptocurrencies like BTC. Hamada pointed out that BTC is less susceptible to the influence of countries and institutions, and its neutrality and decentralized nature allow it to support economic activity without relying on a specific currency. The government will present Hamada with a written response, which is also likely to be published on its website. Oddo To Enter Stablecoin Market With Fireblocks Asset manager and private banking services provider Oddo is collaborating with Fireblocks to crack the stablecoin market. The project will launch as early as next year. Stablecoins have become popular among traders thanks to their low volatility. The project comes after Societe Generale SA’s crypto asset unit in France, which uses the euro-dominated stablecoin (EUR). Ethereum (ETH) Could Catapult Beyond $5,000 The crypto markets have bounced back after experiencing a spate of liquidations during the week. However, none have rebounded as strongly as Ethereum (ETH). The world’s second-largest cryptocurrency is on the brink of moving past $4,000, a key resistance level, and is up almost 24$ over the past month, with its gains surpassing even BTC. An analyst from Nexo predicted ETH could cross $5,000 as early as 2025 and set a new all-time high. “The cogs and bolts are in place. Ethereum could catapult beyond $5,000 as early as 2025.” Some analysts believe ETH has an edge because it is the only token other than BTC with a US-based ETF. “ETH has a big advantage in that it’s the only token besides BTC to have a US ETF. As traditional investors allocate more to crypto they will look to ETH as a natural alternative.” Trump Believes US Is Going To Do Something Great With Crypto President-elect Donald Trump has said the US will do great things with crypto during his upcoming term and become the global leader for cryptocurrency in the next four years. Trump made the comments in response to a question about setting up a strategic Bitcoin reserve, stating, “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else. But others are embracing it, and we want to be ahead.” Trump’s views on crypto are a welcome change for the industry and investors from the current administration, which led a crackdown on the industry. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) went above the $100,000 mark again late on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $102,507. The jump came after the release of November's US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which came along expected lines. The data reinforced optimism about a potential Federal Reserve rate cut next week. However, BTC couldn't maintain its momentum for long, as it dipped below $100,000 and is currently trading around the $99,900 mark. BTC’s latest price action marks a strong recovery from the market crash earlier in the week when BTC dipped below $95,000. Almost all cryptocurrencies registered a substantial price drop. However, BTC’s recovery following the crash also led to a recovery in the broader market, with prominent altcoins notching up double-digit gains. ETFs registered record-breaking inflows, with BlackRock’s iShares ETFs accounting for a staggering $3.2 billion. Now, let’s take a look at BTC’s price chart. BTC set a new all-time high last week as it surged past $100,000 and peaked at $103,900. However, buyers lost momentum after reaching this level, and the price plummeted, falling to a low of $92,279 before settling at $97,094. However, the price picked up on Friday as BTC registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $99,695. Buyers retained control over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal increase on Saturday and then rising by 1.32% to go above $100,000 and settle at $101,043. However, selling pressure increased significantly on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, BTC dropped by 3.57%, going below the 20-day SMA to a low of $94,185. However, buyers propped up the price from this level, and it recovered to settle at $97.434. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC dropped to a low of $94,313 before settling at $96,912, registering a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as BTC recovered, rising over 4% to reclaim $100,000 and settle at $100,900. Buyers pushed BTC to an intraday high of $102,530 on Thursday before losing momentum. As a result, sellers drove BTC down by 0.97% as it slipped below $100,000 and settled at $99,923. The current session sees BTC marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. If buyers take control, BTC could attempt to reclaim $100,000 and push toward its all-time high. Surpassing this level could push BTC to $105,000. If sellers take control, BTC could drop to $97,000 before finding support. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) has made a strong recovery over the past few sessions as it looks to go above the resistance at $4,000. However, it faces an uphill task to overcome this level, with sellers active. ETH faced considerable volatility last Thursday, which saw the price rise to an intraday high of $3,957 and drop to an intraday low of $3,644 before settling at $3,787. However, it recovered strongly on Friday as ETH rose almost 6% to move above $4,000 and settled at $4,003. The weekend saw a tussle between buyers and sellers, and ETH registered a marginal decline on Saturday to drop below $4,000 and settle at $3,999. However, buyers pushed ETH above $4,000 on Sunday as it settled at $4,007 after a marginal increase. Source: TradingView The current week began with a substantial increase in bearish sentiment as ETH dropped over 7%, reaching an intraday low of $3,504 before reclaiming $3,700 and settling at $3,719. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as ETH dipped to a low of $3,519 before ultimately settling at $3,630, registering a decline of 2.32%. Sentiment changed on Wednesday as ETH made a strong recovery, rising almost 6% to go above $3,800 and settling at $3,834. Buyers attempted a move past $4,000 on Thursday. However, ETH lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $3,988 and settled at $3,882, registering an increase of 1.26%. The current session sees ETH up just over 1% as it looks to retest the resistance at $4,000. Some analysts are confident ETH will surpass $4,000 and possibly surge beyond $5,000 as early as 2025. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL)’s struggles to go above the 20-day SMA continue as sellers repelled another attempt to go above it. SOL has witnessed considerable volatility as buyers struggle to push toward $250 and sellers look to lower the price. SOL reached an intraday high of $246 last Friday as it briefly went past the 20-day SMA. However, buyers lost momentum, and SOL ultimately settled at $237, registering only a marginal increase. The weekend was mixed as SOL registered a marginal rise on Saturday and a marginal decline on Sunday to end the weekend on a bearish note. Source: TradingView However, selling pressure intensified considerably on Monday as SOL plummeted 8.55%, falling to an intraday low of $205 before settling at $216. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as SOL dropped to an intraday low of $203. However, buyers propped up the price, and SOL ultimately settled at $213 after a drop of 1.47%. Despite considerable bearish sentiment, SOL recovered on Wednesday, rising over 6% and settling at $227. Buyers attempted to go above the 20-day SMA on Thursday as SOL reached an intraday high of $234. However, they lost momentum in the face of selling pressure at this level, and SOL fell back, dropping to $227 and registering a marginal decline. Sellers have retained control during the current session, with SOL down 1.51% and trading at $223. If sellers retain control, SOL could drop to $215. If this level is breached, the price could drop to $200. Bittensor (TAO) Price Analysis Bittensor (TAO) declined considerably during the week, as selling pressure registered a notable increase, and bearish sentiment dominated the market. TAO was bullish towards the end of last week, rising to an intraday high of $725 on Friday before settling at $705, registering an increase of almost 4%. However, momentum waned on Saturday as TAO dropped 0.95%, falling below $700 and settling at $699. In a sign of things to come, the price fell to an intraday low of $675 on Sunday before recovering to register an increase of 2.03% and go above $700 to settle at $713. Source: TradingView Markets collapsed on Monday and TAO plummeted almost 16%, going below the 20-day SMA and 50-day SMA to drop to a low of $504. However, with buyers active at lower levels, the price recovered partially and settled at $600. Sellers continued to dominate the market on Tuesday as TAO dropped over 4% to settle at $575, but not before recovering from a low of $529. Wednesday witnessed a significant jump in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Sellers ultimately gained the upper hand, and TAO registered an increase of 4.34% and settled at $600. Buyers attempted a move past the 20-day SMA on Thursday as TAO reached an intraday high of $645. However, they lost momentum after reaching this level, allowing sellers to take over. As a result, TAO dropped almost 4% to $577. The current session sees TAO down by 1.32%, as sellers look to lower the price toward the $550 support level. Celestia (TIA) Price Analysis Celestia (TIA) was quite bullish towards the end of the previous week as it registered an increase of 7.31% on Friday and settled at $8.84. However, It failed to stay above the resistance at $9 as sellers drove the price lower. As a result, TIA dropped over 4% on Saturday and 1.11% on Sunday to end the weekend at $8.37. Bearish sentiment increased substantially on Monday as markets collapsed. As a result, TIA plummeted over 20%, going below the 20-day SMA, and settled at $6.68. Source: TradingView Tuesday saw a significant jump in volatility as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. As a result, TIA rose to an intraday high of $7.31 and fell to an intraday low of $6.24 before settling at $6.64 after a marginal decline. Buyers returned to the market on Wednesday as TIA registered an increase of 8.49% to go above $7 and settle at $7.20. Buyers attempted to drive TIA above $7.50 on Thursday as it reached an intraday high of $7.65. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped to $7.20. The current session sees TIA down by almost 1% as sellers look to drive it towards $7. Arbitrum (ARB) Price Analysis Arbitrum (ARB) has recovered during recent sessions after plummeting below $1 at the beginning of the week. ARB reached an intraday high of $1.24 on Friday before settling at $1.13. However, sentiment changed over the weekend, dropping by 0.89% on Saturday and 0.43% on Sunday to settle at $1.15. Bearish sentiment increased significantly on Monday as ARB plummeted over 17%, going below the 20-day SMA to an intraday low of $0.84. However, it recovered from this level to climb above the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.96. Selling pressure persisted on Tuesday as ARB went below the 20-day SMA after a drop of just over 2% and settled at $0.93. Source: TradingView Despite considerable selling pressure, ARB recovered on Wednesday, registering an increase of 6.51% to go above the 20-day SMA and settle at $0.99. Buyers retained control on Tuesday as ARB surged to an intraday high of $1.11. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $1.02, registering an increase of almost 3%. The current session sees ARB up by 2.57% and trading at $1.05 as buyers look to consolidate above $1. Hedera (HBAR) Price Analysis Hedera (HBAR) is attempting to reclaim $0.30 after suffering a dramatic collapse at the beginning of the week. Sentiment around HBAR changed over the weekend as it dropped almost 10% on Saturday after failing to go above $0.40. The price registered a marginal increase on Sunday before falling back in the red on Monday, dropping almost 16% to an intraday low of $0.236 before settling at $0.280. Despite starting the week on a negative note, HBAR recovered on Tuesday, registering an increase of 3.33% after falling to an intraday low of $0.252 and settling at $0.289. Source: TradingView Sellers retained control on Wednesday as HBAR registered an increase of almost 3% and settled at $0.298.

By combining a decentralized cloud network with a scarcity-driven tokenomics model, NXQ offers a secure, growth-oriented investment opportunity inspired by the principles that propelled Bitcoin’s success. Understanding the Project NexQloud provides a decentralized cloud infrastructure that outperforms traditional data centers on cost, efficiency, and security. Instead of relying on energy-hungry facilities, NexQloud uses QloudNodes—specialized devices set up by contributors—to create a secure, distributed cloud network. This model significantly reduces costs for businesses while enhancing data security and environmental sustainability. NXQ Tokens: The Backbone of NexQloud NXQ Tokens are rewarded to hardware contributors who power NexQloud’s network. As NexQloud generates revenue from cloud services sold to enterprise clients, that revenue is used to buy NXQ Tokens on the open market. This creates an organic and recurring demand cycle. The more successful NexQloud becomes, the greater the demand for NXQ Tokens, benefiting token holders through potential price appreciation. Tokenomics: Built for Long-Term Value NXQ’s value proposition lies in its scarcity and utility. With a total supply capped at 21 million tokens and a daily distribution of 3600 tokens to contributors, NXQ operates on a deflationary model. Every four years, the token distribution rate is halved, mirroring Bitcoin’s halving mechanism. This structured reduction in supply, combined with increasing demand from enterprise customers, sets the stage for steady, long-term growth. How Demand Drives Value NXQ Tokens are more than a speculative asset. As NexQloud’s client base expands, businesses require more NXQ Tokens to access cloud services. As they consume more computing resources, token demand rises. With new QloudNodes coming online and competing for daily token distribution, the scarcity effect intensifies, further driving value. Investment Potential NXQ’s real-world utility, backed by the growth of NexQloud’s cloud platform, makes it a compelling investment for hardware providers and crypto speculators. Unlike many tokens that rely purely on hype, NXQ is tied to a profitable, enterprise-driven model, providing investors with confidence in the token’s long-term prospects. The balance of supply and demand ensures that NXQ’s value is both sustainable and growth-oriented. Secure Your Investment in the Future NXQ Tokens offer a unique blend of security, scarcity, and real-world utility. As NexQloud’s network continues to grow, the potential for token appreciation remains strong. Don’t miss your chance to be part of this innovative cloud and crypto revolution.

37581638,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392709,1734084118,Ethena Labs Hints at USDe Stablecoin Launch Pegged to USD on Dec. 16,"The post Ethena Labs Hints at USDe Stablecoin Launch Pegged to USD on Dec. 16 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethena Labs is set to launch its synthetic stablecoin, USDe, on December 16, 2024, with its market cap already reaching $5.73 billion. Unlike traditional stablecoins like USDT or USDC, USDe is designed as a yield-generating asset rather than just a transaction tool. USDe has quickly gained traction in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world, with its trading volume jumping by over 24% in a single day to $171.09 million. This shows a strong demand for yield-generating assets, especially in a bullish market. With a $200B market cap, stablecoins are here to change the crypto game. JUST IN: ETHENA LABS HINTS AT LAUNCHING ITS NEW STABLECOIN, USDE, PEGGED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, ON DEC. 16 — BSCN Headlines (@BSCNheadlines) December 13, 2024 Let’s see what makes it so appealing. Curious about Ethena’s future? Read Ethena price prediction to discover what experts are forecasting for its next big move! What Makes USDe Different? USDe’s innovative model sets it apart from typical fiat-backed stablecoins. Instead of relying on reserves, it uses a delta-neutral trading strategy, balancing long and short positions in Bitcoin and Ethereum to maintain stability. This strategy has helped USDe become the third-largest USD-pegged stablecoin, surpassing DAI in market cap. However, there are concerns about the sustainability of this model, especially in a bear market. On the brighter side, Wintermute now uses it for trading, and it’s become the fastest-growing asset on Aave, a major DeFi platform. Ethena made $200 million in fees this year and is sharing some of that with token holders. Meanwhile, its native token, ENA, has jumped in value by five times since June. However, competitors like MakerDAO, which recently rebranded its stablecoin Dai to USDS, are adding pressure. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : SUI Price To 2X This AltSeason As Technical Indicators Turn Bullish? , Analyst Raises Doubts Despite its success, experts have raised concerns about USDe’s resilience, and security concerns. Andre Cronje, CTO of Fantom Foundation, has warned that USDe’s model might only work well in bullish markets. If market conditions turn bearish, the funding rates could drop, reducing yields and potentially destabilizing the coin. This has drawn comparisons to the collapse of Terra-Luna in 2022, which also struggled to maintain its peg during market downturns. Looking Ahead While USDe offers attractive returns and innovative strategies, its long-term stability is yet to be tested in volatile or bearish markets. The crypto community is watching closely to see if Ethena Labs can sustain USDe’s growth and avoid the pitfalls faced by previous high-yield stablecoins. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Crypto ETFs offer exposure by investing directly in the assets and/or companies involved in the digital economy. Crypto has been considered a higher-risk investment. Yet, as more regulatory acceptance is achieved, exposure to crypto may offer investors an opportunity to capitalize on the growth of digital assets. Three crypto-focused ETFs, with an average one-year return of +146%, possess incredible momentum and offer investors exposure to a diverse range of crypto and crypto-linked assets. Based on SA’s Quant Ratings, these ETFs possess incredible momentum. Christmas Comes Early for Crypto Fans Every year, investors hope for a 'Santa Claus Rally' – the historical (but never guaranteed) phenomenon in which the stock market jolts in value during the last week of December and the first few trading days of the new year. Cryptocurrency holders need not wait. Christmas has come early for crypto enthusiasts as the presidential victory of Donald Trump, who has pledged to make America “the crypto capital of the planet,” has sent the prices of digital coins soaring. According to crypto data provider CoinGecko, the global cryptocurrency market's value eclipsed $3T for the first time in three years last month, as investors rejoiced at the potential of easing regulatory restrictions on the industry in U.S. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) surged to an all-time high of over $100,000 on December 5, topping only its previous record from the day after election day. The Total Market Value of All Cryptocurrencies Exploded in November Seeking Alpha Premium Meanwhile, the resignation of SEC chair Gary Gensler, whom Trump plans to replace with crypto bull Paul Atkins, is set to shift the balance of power at the securities watchdog to a Republican majority – another reason for Wall Street to celebrate as Trump taps financiers like hedge fund executive Scott Bessent as Treasury pick. Regardless of how many crypto campaign promises Trump manages to keep, many analysts believe that crypto’s bull run will continue well into 2025. One such expert is Geoff Kendrick, head of Crypto Research at Standard Chartered Bank, who recently predicted that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of next year. Digital assets could offer an opportunity for investors looking to gain in a unique space achieving more regulatory acceptance “fairly quickly.” Investing in Cryptocurrency As Bitcoin and other digital currencies benefit from the global artificial intelligence push and crypto gains regulatory acceptance, investors wanting some exposure to the space may want a more accessible solution than navigating the complex universe of crypto exchanges and digital wallets. Crypto ETFs, which track the performance of one or more digital currencies and are traded on traditional stock exchanges, which can help with some of the regulatory risks associated with trading on unregulated crypto exchanges, though market risk is still involved. Some key features of crypto ETFs include: Accessibility - Crypto ETFs are traded like stocks on traditional exchanges and can therefore be accessed through brokerage accounts. Regulation - Trading through traditional exchanges offers greater regulation by financial authorities than directly holding crypto, subject to less security and oversight. Diversification - ETFs often include multiple cryptocurrencies and holdings, offering diversification rather than single-asset investments. Seeking Alpha’s Quant ETF Grades are generated by a proprietary system that aims to provide investors with an instant characterization of each ETF. The SA quant system grades organize the market’s Top ETFs by five factors: Momentum, Expenses, Dividends, Risk, and Liquidity. Key ETF metrics are systematically gathered and compared to the median of all ETFs, then assigned a grade from A+ to F. Investors can also use advanced filters to view various ETF asset classes and subclasses, including digital assets. Cryptocurrency-focused ETFs invest directly in digital assets or indirectly in miners and stocks involved in crypto. Although crypto ETFs have strong momentum, investors should realize they are also highly volatile, as demonstrated by their ‘F’ Risk Grades, and subject to expenses, which typically include management fees, custodian charges for holding the fund’s assets, and fees and expenses from fund administrators, auditors, etc. Seeking Alpha Premium The SA Quant Team identified three ETFs that expose investors to a wide range of crypto assets.

While all three of these ETFs make for compelling choices according to SA’s Quant system, investing in crypto comes with serious risks that every investor should consider. Risks While 2025 will inevitably be an exciting year for cryptocurrency, it is important to consider the risks involved, as these assets are highly volatile and can often be extremely speculative. The SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy “ continues to urge investors to be cautious if considering an investment involving crypto asset securities.” Where mainstream adoption has catapulted many digital assets to new highs, as Seeking Alpha analyst Joseph Calhoun said , “In today's wild west of finance, even conservative investors can get taken,"" so always invest knowing the possibility that your holdings could decline swiftly and without warning.

Three crypto-focused ETFs, hand-selected using SA’s Quant ratings provide investors with exposure to a diverse range of digital assets through direct investments or investments in companies involved in the broader crypto economy.

Its debt-financed Bitcoin purchase strategy has been highly successful, with the total value of its BTC holdings now reaching $42.45 billion. Reports suggest that this strategy, led by MicroStrategy’s executive chairman Michael J. Saylor, has influenced major Bitcoin mining companies like Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms to follow suit. Let’s explore how these companies are adopting a similar approach. What Mining Giants Are Doing Reports indicate that Marathon Digital and Riot Platforms are planning to issue convertible notes to purchase Bitcoin.

However, many experts are skeptical about the long-term viability of debt-financed Bitcoin purchases. Some argue that mining companies should focus on increasing their Bitcoin holdings through traditional methods rather than relying on debt. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The lender's digital assets-focused subsidiary, SG-Forge, deposited as collateral some bonds issued in 2020 on the public Ethereum blockchain in exchange for central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Banque de France on its DL3S blockchain, it said in a press release.  With the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework already in place for stablecoin issuers, SG-Forge has maintained a high profile exploring ways to deploy its euro stablecoin, EUR CoinVertible (EURCV). The token was not involved in the repo transaction.  The Banque de France, meanwhile, has been energetically testing the feasibility of wholesale CBDCs to improve things like cross-border payments and settlement finality. Broadly speaking, blockchain-based repo transactions have proved to be one of the more compelling uses of the tech among banks.  “This transaction demonstrates the technical feasibility of interbank refinancing operations directly on blockchain.

37581320,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=145998,1734083490,Crypto Investors Eye This $0.06 Token as the Next Ethereum Challenger,"A six-cent token is stirring excitement in the cryptocurrency world. Some believe this low-cost coin could become a strong rival to Ethereum. It has caught the eye of many investors searching for the next big opportunity. What is driving the buzz around this token, and could it truly challenge one of crypto’s giants? CYBRO to List Ahead of Schedule Following 450% Surge and $7 Million Presale CYBRO, the AI-driven multichain platform, is accelerating its timeline for listing on major exchanges after a standout presale performance. The platform raised $7 million and drew nearly 20,000 investors, positioning itself as a frontrunner in decentralized finance innovation. During its presale, CYBRO’s token price surged 450%, climbing from $0.01 to $0.055. The token is set to debut at $0.06 on major crypto exchanges including Gate.io, and the listing is planned on December 14th. Be part of CYBRO’s listing momentum before it unlocks the full potential CYBRO aims to democratize access to decentralized finance with tools such as staking, farming, and lending. Its presale marked key milestones, including: CYBRO App Launch: Over 30 vaults offering competitive APYs, tailored to diverse investor strategies Blast Index Debut: A one-click investment feature that simplifies DeFi participation by integrating with lending protocols Platform Growth: Laying the groundwork for a streamlined, user-centric DeFi ecosystem. The platform’s roadmap through 2025 promises to build on its foundation with advanced features such as leverage farming, lending aggregators, and enhanced AI-powered tools. CYBRO’s listing comes amid growing interest in AI-driven financial platforms. With the momentum from its presale and a planned listing price of $0.06, the project is set to draw increased attention from both retail and institutional investors. As CYBRO prepares for its market debut, its combination of strong fundamentals and rapid growth positions it as one to watch in the evolving DeFi landscape. Prepare for Lift-Off: CYBRO’s presale success is just the beginning Ethereum’s Upward Momentum Tests Key Resistance Levels Ethereum is currently trading between $3643.14 and $4232.62, showing strong momentum with a 16.52% increase over the past month. The cryptocurrency is approaching its nearest resistance level at $4457.83. Technical indicators like the MACD at 57.06 suggest bullish momentum, but the RSI at 70.90 and Stochastic at 91.50 indicate overbought conditions. If the upward trend continues, Ethereum could potentially rise to the second resistance level at $5047.32, representing an increase of about 19%. However, if the price fails to break the resistance, it may retrace to the nearest support level at $3278.88. Conclusion In the midst of the 2024 bull run, established assets like Ethereum may offer less short-term potential compared to emerging platforms. CYBRO, an advanced DeFi platform, provides investors with unique opportunities to enhance their earnings through AI-driven yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features such as attractive staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO delivers a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals.

37581416,184990,1734083422,"LBank Labs Latest Report: Memecoins Explode in 2024, Exchanges Race for $100B Market","Singapore, Singapore, December 13th, 2024, Chainwire LBank Labs , in collaboration with MetaEra and Bee Network, has jointly published its latest report titled "" 2024 Memecoins Report : From Controversial Narrative to a $100B Market."" The report highlights a paradigm shift in the memecoins, which have evolved from short-term speculative assets to a sophisticated market with a total capitalization exceeding $100 billion. The memecoins market has demonstrated significant growth in 2024, with the Benchmark index surging 279.8%, outperforming assets like Bitcoin (118.9%) and gold (27.4%). This growth reflects not merely speculative interest, but a fundamental transformation in how memecoins are perceived and valued in the crypto industry. This notable market expansion has been fueled by two game-changing developments: breakthroughs in infrastructure and an explosion in memecoins cultural diversity. The emergence of specialized platforms like Pump.fun has dramatically simplified memecoins creation and trading, sustaining market momentum throughout this cycle. In this flourishing landscape, Solana and Ethereum have become the go-to destinations for memecoins. Ethereum remains the bedrock for established memecoins, and Solana has become the platform for new launches due to its agility in capturing market momentum. The numbers speak volumes: the market capitalization of Ethereum’s memecoins reached $34 billion, and Solana’s at $20.4 billion. Together, they account for nearly 47% of the total memecoin market. Alongside infrastructure advancement, the diversification of memecoins culture has emerged as another powerful market driver. These memecoins generally fall into four main types: Cult memecoins built on strong community consensus; the Animal memecoins that started it all; Trending event memecoins that capture hype; and the AI-themed memecoins that combine technology. Notably, these categories have begun to overlap as the market matures, creating more sophisticated memecoins narratives. This maturation has sparked a dramatic shift in market sentiment. What began as a retail-driven phenomenon has gained institutional traction, with major players like DWF Ventures, Pantera Capital, Franklin Templeton, and VanEck embracing the value of memecoins and adopting a more open attitude toward the memecoins market. Cryptocurrency exchanges have pivoted in response, racing to capture the memecoins market. In the competitive landscape of cryptocurrency exchanges, LBank cryptocurrency exchange has shown strong performance in the memecoins market through strategic timing and efficient execution. The numbers reflect this approach: with 281 memecoins listings in 2024 accounting for 34% of its total listings, followed by Gate.io (62) and Bitget (46). Notably, all top 10 trending memecoins identified in LBank's previous "" Top 10 Trending Memecoins of 2024 "" report were successfully listed on the platform. The performance of GOAT (29,900%), MOODENG (6,746%), and ACT (7,860%) on LBank reflect its ability to identify and support promising projects at their earliest stages. Analysis of major meme projects reveals LBank's competitive positioning in the market. While established exchanges like Binance and OKX command larger trading volumes, LBank's strategy of early listing and active support has created significant value for traders. This is particularly evident in projects like GOAT and MOODENG, where LBank's early market entry and trading metrics have matched or exceeded those of larger exchanges, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying and supporting emerging projects. LBank's strategic focus on the memecoins market has proven effective, contributing to its milestone achievement of reaching 15 million global users. The launch of its slogan ""Discover The Era of Meme Legends"" in early 2024 has resonated strongly with the market evolution. As memecoins continue to mature, LBank cryptocurrency exchange remains committed to its strategic approach, introducing innovative initiatives and fostering market development to drive the next phase of industry growth. About LBank Founded in 2015, LBank is a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, serving over 15 million registered users in more than 210 countries and regions. With a daily derivatives trading volume of more than $67 billion and support for over 800 cryptocurrencies, LBank is committed to delivering a comprehensive and user-friendly trading experience. Through innovative trading solutions, LBank has helped users achieve average returns of over 130% on newly listed assets.

The platform raised $250M in a private sale, backed by some of the top VC funds. Avalanche (AVAX) extended its relationship with top VC funds, aiming to transform itself from a L2 chain and run an independent new L1. The most recent funding round for $250M was completed as a private placement with some of the leading investors in decentralized projects. The funding was completed after an OTC sale, and was led by DragonFly Capital, Galaxy, and ParaFi Capital. The OTC placement reached up to 40 smaller companies and investors, some seeking to use the services of Avalanche as their native platform. Avalanche achieved its single biggest financing round for $250M. | Source: Cryptorank Since its launch, Avalanche raised more than $577M, including four ICO events, a seed round, and additional undisclosed funding. The recent fundraising effort is the single largest capital injection for Avalanche. Avalanche raised the funds as an addition to its track record of successful funding. The goal is to support the Avalanche9000 upgrade, a new chain that has been tested since the end of November. Avalanche aims to rebrand from Web3 gaming network Avalanche forged its success as one of the leading networks for Web3 and gaming. Avalanche C-Chain was the consumer-oriented L2 network, which carried some of the hottest play-to-earn games. C-Chain was also compatible with DeFi, DEX trading, and general Web3 activities. As a result, Avalanche still retains $1.64B in locked liquidity, though still far from the 2021 levels of over $10B. One of the big obstacles to building on Avalanche was the deposit requirement to build a subnet. Subnets were a technology that proved successful for some of the early Avalanche projects. Games or web projects would launch a subnet when their activity overwhelmed the capacity of C-Chain. Avalanche now aims to build a practically free layer, similar to SUI or Aptos. Previously, subnet builders had to stake a minimum of 2,000 AVAX. Instead of a gaming network, Avalanche9000 will aim to position itself as a tokenization hub, with a focus on Web3 and DeFi. The new L1 will aim to retain some of the successful apps from C-Chain, including DEX and GameFi projects. The funding round arrived just days before the intended launch of Avalanche9000. The chain has already onboarded up to 150K potential users and 40K routers in preparation for its December 16 launch. The chain has already partnered with Uplink, a startup for decentralized connectivity, which will build on the new L1. Can AVAX recover to a higher range? AVAX was among the most promising L2 tokens, and the project is one of the best-funded in the Web3 space. However, during the bear market, Avalanche C-Chain lagged behind Arbitrum and Optimism . AVAX is also carrying a backlog of locked tokens, with only 57% of the supply in circulation. Almost all ecosystem participants and early VC backers will continue to unlock their allocation over the next few years. As a result, AVAX spend years trading under $20. The asset was considered a potential competitor to Solana, though it only expanded above $100 for a brief period. In late 2024, AVAX had another rally to a local high of $55.30. AVAX is close to the top 10 of coins and tokens, gaining additional exposure from its recent market rally. AVAX open interest has also recovered above $480M, near the peak of the range for the past three years. The additional exposure from Avalanche9000 and the hype around the main net launch may boost AVAX, as it has shown the ability to outperform. Avalanche C-Chain receives $100M of inflows mainly from Ethereum, with around 7% of that bridged amount in stablecoins. Due to its relatively early launch in 2019, Avalanche is also one of the few chains with 1.6B in native Tether (USDT). As a L1 network, Avalanche may offer additional RWA tokenization to some of its partners. The Avalanche Project is actively curated by the Avalanche Foundation. In the past, the Avalanche team has also worked as an incubator for Web3 projects and games. After the launch of the L1 network, Avalanche may retain some of its top projects.

The latest pledge forms part of the team’s mission to create a marketplace for “programmable trust” through its decentralized restaking protocol. Eigen Foundation’s 1% Token Pledge The Protocol Guild, which comprises over 180 members from 29 teams, plays a crucial role in maintaining Ethereum’s decentralized network. Its members focus on key areas such as client development, research, specification design, testing, and coordination. This ensures Ethereum’s continuous evolution and resilience against centralized capture. EigenLayer enables staked ETH to serve as cryptoeconomic security for other protocols, improving Ethereum’s security while supporting innovation. By dedicating a portion of its token supply to the Protocol Guild, the Eigen Foundation aligns its goals with the Guild’s mission of ensuring sustainable incentives for Ethereum’s maintainers. Its official statement read, “This commitment aligns with EigenLayer’s mission: To extend Ethereum’s security through restaking and creating a marketplace for programmable trust. We’re proud to contribute to Ethereum’s growth and long-term sustainability. The latest development comes after the Eigen Foundation announced the EIGEN Season 2 Stakedrop in September. This distribution initiative aimed at recognizing contributors and participants who have supported its development. The entity had then stated that the stakedrop would allocate EIGEN tokens across three categories: stakers and operators who actively participated during the season, ecosystem partners such as rollups and RaaS providers, and community members who have played a pivotal role in advocating for EigenLayer. A month later, EIGEN debuted on several exchanges in one of the most heavily discussed and anticipated token launches of 2024. EigenLayer’s Growth And Two Security Breaches Launched by Sreeram Kannan in early 2021, EigenLayer rose to prominence as a leading DeFi project in 2024, with over $18 billion in total value locked (TVL) as reported by DeFiLlama. However, EigenLayer suffered a $5.7 million hack involving stolen tokens sold via decentralized exchanges. The protocol faced another security breach on October 18 when its official X account was hacked . The attackers used the compromised account to advertise a fake airdrop campaign, directing users to malicious links disguised as part of the concluded Season 2 token distribution. On-chain investigator ZachXBT and Polygon Labs’ Mudit Gupta quickly warned users to avoid these links. Scam Sniffer later confirmed the phishing scheme.

For the first time since 2016, Solana has surpassed Ethereum in new developer activity, attracting 7,625 fresh contributors compared to Ethereum’s 6,456. This rise marks an 83% year-over-year growth for the Solana ecosystem, with much of its momentum coming from increased adoption across Asia. Throughout the year, Solana managed to outpace Ethereum in key metrics, including network activity and daily fee generation during certain periods. Notably, on March 18, Solana’s network activity spiked amid a rush for Solana-based memecoins, and on October 28, it briefly outdid Ethereum in 24-hour fee generation. Ethereum Still Dominates in Total Developer Activity Despite losing its top spot for onboarding new developers, Ethereum remains the number one blockchain ecosystem in overall developer activity. The network recorded 6,244 active monthly developers in 2024, representing a 17% drop from the previous year. However, Ethereum continues to lead globally, with the highest number of active developers across all major continents, including Asia, Europe, and North America. Ethereum’s layer-2 networks also saw notable growth, with developer activity rising by 64% since 2021. Additionally, Eigenlayer, Ethereum’s primary restaking protocol, emerged as the fastest-growing ecosystem in 2024, with a staggering 167% increase in active developers. Crypto Broader Adoption Electric Capital’s report highlights that crypto development is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, with activity growing in regions like Africa, South America, and Asia. Asia now hosts one in three crypto developers worldwide, fueled by strong contributions from countries like India, which onboarded the most new developers in 2024. The report also underscores how different regions are driving various use cases. For instance, stablecoin transactions remain consistently active across Asian, European, and African time zones. Meanwhile, NFT trading activity peaks during American work hours, with minting activity predominantly occurring during Asia’s daytime.

37580709,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661992,1734082217,"Ethereum: Analysts Eye $4,100 Target As ETH Reclaims Key Support Level","Ethereum (ETH) has seen a significant 4.7% recovery in the last 24 hours, reclaiming a crucial support zone. This performance has fueled a bullish sentiment among some market watchers, who consider the cryptocurrency to break above a key resistance level in the coming days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees First Close Above $100,000, But Is A Big Correction Coming? Ethereum Reclaims Key Support Nearly a week ago, Ethereum jumped above $4,000 for the first time in nine months, nearing its march-high and the long-awaited $4,100 resistance level. However, the cryptocurrency’s rally was momentarily paused after the crypto market saw a significant pullback. Earlier this week, ETH retraced nearly 10%, dipping below the $3,500 mark as Bitcoin retraced to $95,000. After the retrace, the second-largest crypto by market capitalization has steadily climbed back, recovering the $3,800 support zone on Wednesday afternoon. ETH’s price then rose another 2% in the early hours of Thursday to trade above the $3,900 level again. As Ethereum reclaimed this key zone, Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt noted that the cryptocurrency was trading back above its ascending support trendline, which it had lost during the market correction. Additionally, the King of Altcoins was retesting a six-day downtrend line in the 4-hour chart, which would target a surge toward $4,000 after a successful breakout from the $3,940 mark. Ethereum broke above this resistance in the following hours, surging to a daily high of $3,985 before retracing to $3,945. Per the analyst, holding above this level could propel ETH’s price to $4,100 in the coming days. ETH To $5,000 Soon? According to some analysts, despite reclaiming the $3,900 zone, Ethereum still needs to turn another multi-year resistance into support successfully. Analyst Alex Clay recently pointed out that ETH has been retesting the $9,350 level since 2021, unsuccessfully turning it into support over the past few years. Ethereum has faced rejection at this resistance level on four different occasions. However, when ETH broke and held this level, it rallied toward its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878 around three years ago. Crypto analyst Jelle suggested that Ethereum is preparing for massive moves as it recently broke out of a multi-year pennant. ETH-based Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen a massive surge since the post-election rally. As Farside Investors data shows, ETH ETFs have seen over $500 million in inflows this week and over $1.3 billion since this month started. This signals increased demand from institutional players, adding to the cryptocurrency’s momentum. Related Reading: Analyst Sounds The Alarm As Solana (SOL) Retests $210, Rebound Or Retrace Next? Moreover, the Donald Trump-backed DeFi project World Liberty Financial Initiative (WLFI) acquired around $10 million in ETH yesterday. Lookonchain said the WLFI wallet bought 2,631 ETH at $3,801 per token. To Jelle, this “looks like ETH season just got the ‘go ahead’ nod from institutions.” If Ethereum reclaims the $3,950 resistance into support, there will be “very little standing in the way of new all-time highs from here,” the analyst added. He forecasted that Ethereum could hit $5,000 after breaking out and that 2025 will be a “comeback year for ETH.” As of this writing, ETH is trading at $3,951, a 4.7% surge in the daily timeframe.

However, the hacked Indian crypto exchange has temporarily halted withdrawals and seems to be cooperating with authorities. Binance bailout or routine rebalancing? An on-chain Sleuth in an X post flagged $200 million moving to a wallet allegedly controlled by WazirX. This move has sparked theories of what might be a Binance-led bailout. In this pursuit, one user speculated a potential reimbursement deal and suggested “Funding from Binance, likely for equity or token-based compensation.” Others placed 95% odds on a reimbursement announcement. The on-chain investigator mentioned that WazirX consolidated user funds that were untouched during the hack into a wallet two months ago. The funds were shifted from the deposit addresses and hot wallets.

According to data retrieved by Finbold from Arkham Intelligence , a public data application that enables users to analyze blockchain and cryptocurrency activity, Trump’s holdings surged by $6.78 million in just one day as of December 13, 2024. But before you think Trump has fully embraced crypto as his new political weapon, there’s more to the story than meets the eye. Trump crypto portfolio. Source: Arkham Intelligence What’s in Trump’s digital wallet? Trump’s publicly known wallet holds a curious mix of assets, including Ethereum ( ETH ), Wrapped Ethereum ( WETH ), and a slew of meme tokens like TROG and TRUMP. Other smaller holdings include GUA, USDC, TUA, and RIO. On paper, it looks like a bold bet on everything from mainstream crypto to the wild world of internet humor. But don’t let the numbers fool you — not all if any of these tokens were necessarily purchased by Trump himself. In crypto, anyone can send tokens to any known wallet, whether invited or not. This means that while these coins are tied to Trump’s wallet, they haven’t been officially confirmed as his own investments. It’s a classic crypto stunt: creators send tokens to high-profile figures to boost their coin’s credibility. Sometimes, it’s a clever marketing move; other times, it’s just flat-out misleading. Crypto market is bullish on Trump The bulk of Trump’s portfolio is dominated by TROG, which clocks in at $10.49 million. The TRUMP token — yes, named after him — adds another $1.07 million to the mix. But just because these tokens live in his wallet doesn’t mean he’s cashing in on meme coin mania. Interestingly, Trump’s own stance on crypto has taken a turn. On December 12, he made his position clear: “We’re going to do something great with crypto because we don’t want China or anybody else, not just China but others, embracing it, and we want to be the head.” Trump seems to be ready to position the U.S. at the forefront of the crypto race, a shift from his previous skepticism.

37580264,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392658,1734081426,Become a Millionaire with These 10 Altcoin Picks in 2024,"The post Become a Millionaire with These 10 Altcoin Picks in 2024 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a recent YouTube video, crypto analyst Crypto Banter revealed his top 10 altcoin picks that could soar up to 50x during the current market rally. As the crypto market heats up, these coins are gaining massive attention from investors eager for big returns. What makes these tokens stand out? From surprising breakout potentials to under-the-radar gems, these altcoins have unique factors driving their potential. Let’s dive into the details below. DogWifhat (WIF): Aiming for 4X Returns First on the list is DogWifhat , which recently broke through a key resistance level. Analysts predict a 400% surge, targeting the 3.1-3.168 Fibonacci extension . The key support level is $2—if the price drops below this, the bullish outlook could be invalidated. GOAT: Ready for a Breakout Next is GOAT, which has reclaimed an important trading range. The initial target is set at $0.998, with the potential to rise to $1.33 or even higher. Bonk (BONK): Eyeing a Bullish Reversal Bonk is another token in the spotlight. After losing its range high, it has cooled off, but if it can reclaim the 50% Fibonacci level, it might surprise investors with a strong reversal . Brett: Testing New Highs Brett is catching attention as it backtests its mid-range level. With a possible target of $0.57 (a 223% increase), it’s a standout pick for the current cycle. Pepe: Staying Strong Pepe continues to outperform meme coins like Dogecoin. Although it’s consolidating at the moment, its relative strength suggests it could surge again soon. Popcat: An Undervalued Gem Popcat is holding steady within its mid-range demand zone. Analysts see this as an ideal buying opportunity, with significant upside potential in the current market. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Mining Giants Follow MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Strategy, but at What Cost? , GigaChad: On the Path to Gains Next up is GigaChad, which has been charting a path toward a 280% gain. Currently, in a strong demand zone, it could soar to new ATH, especially with the possibility of a Coinbase listing. Myro: Testing Demand Zones Myro is another token worth watching as it tests key demand zones near $0.085, this entry point could lead to long-term gains. Aptos: Maintaining a Bullish Outlook Aptos has shown strength on the weekly charts, with a slight pullback expected before continuing its uptrend. Its overall trajectory remains positive for the near term . Render (RNDR): Ready for a Breakout Lastly, Render is forming a rounded bottom pattern and looks ready to follow Bitcoin’s lead. Breaking its $1.38 resistance could unlock significant upward movement, making it a token to watch closely . .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Gala, however, needs to reclaim $0.063 to confirm a bullish breakout. Meanwhile, ApeCoin (APE) has broken out of a falling wedge, presenting a 136% potential move above $2. Vulcan Forged (PYR) and other gaming tokens are also expected to gain momentum during gaming rotations. Finally, Beam stands out with a cup-and-handle pattern, indicating a potential 105% breakout in the upcoming rally.",POSITIVE,없음,ALTCOIN | BTC | MARKET | TRADING | ZRX | APT,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-analyst-reveals-top-10-altcoins-poised-for-50x-returns-here-are-they/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Over the years, we’ve seen meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu carve out a permanent place in pop culture and investment portfolios. Now, BTFD Coin is poised to take this explosive sector to the next level with its unique P2E game, staking rewards, and vibrant community power. This new kid on the block isn’t just here to play; it’s here to dominate. BTFD Coin’s highly-anticipated presale launched on November 26, 2024, and the buzz is already massive. With analysts predicting jaw-dropping price growth, investors are scrambling to grab a piece of the action. Let’s dive deeper into why BTFD Coin and other standout meme coins are the best meme coins to join now. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Riding High on Momentum BTFD Coin is already making waves in the crypto world, and for good reason. The coin’s presale performance has been nothing short of electric. Starting at just $0.000004 per coin, it reached its fourth stage—one-fourth of the presale journey—within 24 hours. Currently in its 11th stage, BTFD is priced at $0.00012, having raised over $3.6 million so far. With more than 52 billion $BTFD coins sold and 4,700+ bulls backing it, this project is set to disrupt the meme coin space. So, what makes BTFD one of the best meme coins to join now? Let’s talk features. BTFD isn’t your average pump-and-dump meme coin. It’s built for long-term value, with a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that adds a layer of utility and excitement. Players can earn rewards while gaming, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Combine that with staking rewards and an active, bullish community, and you’ve got a recipe for explosive growth. Consider this: if you’d invested $5,000 in Stage 5, where BTFD was priced at $0.00005 per coin, you’d have snagged 100 million coins. Once BTFD hits $0.0006 at the end of the presale, those coins would be worth $60,000. That’s a 12x return on your initial investment. Not bad for a coin that started as a buzzword. But it’s not just about the numbers. BTFD Coin is also leaning heavily on community engagement. Its “Buy the Dip” philosophy has resonated with younger investors, particularly Gen Z and Millennials, who love a good underdog story. It’s become more than just an investment; it’s a movement. Whether you’re in it for the gains or the camaraderie, BTFD Coin ticks all the boxes. Mog Coin: The Silent Contender Mog Coin might not have the same flashy presale stats as BTFD Coin, but it’s quietly building a reputation as one of the best meme coins to join now. Its appeal lies in its simplicity and focus. Mog doesn’t try to do everything; instead, it focuses on being a meme coin with solid fundamentals. And sometimes, that’s all you need. What sets Mog apart is its transparency and straightforward approach. Unlike many meme coins that overpromise and underdeliver, Mog delivers exactly what it says on the tin: a fun, engaging crypto experience with the potential for big returns. Its community is tight-knit and supportive, creating an environment where holders feel like they’re part of something bigger. One of Mog’s standout features is its liquidity pool, designed to ensure long-term stability. While many meme coins suffer from extreme volatility, Mog has taken steps to reduce price swings and make its token more attractive to risk-averse investors. That’s a big deal in a market where even the smallest hiccup can send prices tumbling. And let’s not forget about its growth potential. Mog Coin has been quietly making its way up the ranks, attracting attention from seasoned investors who see its potential as a sleeper hit. With its growing community and stable fundamentals, Mog is positioning itself as a strong contender in the meme coin space. Is Mog Coin the flashiest option out there? No. But sometimes, slow and steady really does win the race. If you’re looking for a meme coin that’s fun, stable, and full of potential, Mog deserves a spot on your radar. COQ Inu: The Community Powerhouse COQ Inu might sound like just another meme coin, but don’t let the quirky name fool you. This project is all about community, and it’s quickly gaining traction as one of the best meme coins to join now. If you’re the kind of investor who values engagement and camaraderie as much as profits, COQ Inu might be your perfect match. What sets COQ Inu apart is its laser focus on building a strong, vibrant community. From interactive social media campaigns to regular AMAs with the dev team, COQ Inu has created an environment where holders feel heard and valued. That sense of belonging is a huge draw for younger investors who view crypto as more than just a money-making tool. COQ Inu also excels in the utility department. While many meme coins rely solely on hype, COQ Inu is developing a decentralised ecosystem that includes everything from NFTs to gamified staking options. It’s a bold move that’s paying off, as more investors are drawn to its innovative approach. The numbers back it up, too. COQ Inu’s market cap has been steadily climbing, and its holder base is growing by the day. It’s not hard to see why. With its blend of community engagement and utility, COQ Inu is proving that meme coins can be more than just a joke. But let’s not sugarcoat it: COQ Inu isn’t without its risks. Like any meme coin, it’s heavily influenced by market sentiment, and its success depends largely on its ability to maintain hype. That said, its community-driven approach gives it a fighting chance to stand out in a crowded market. If you’re looking for a meme coin with heart, COQ Inu might be the one for you. It’s not just a coin; it’s a community. And in the world of crypto, that can make all the difference. Conclusion: BTFD Coin Leads the Charge Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin is the clear frontrunner in the meme coin space. Its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and strong community backing make it a must-have for any serious crypto investor. With its price set to skyrocket after the presale, there’s never been a better time to get in on the action. Mog Coin and COQ Inu also bring unique strengths to the table, offering a mix of stability and community engagement that appeals to different types of investors. But if you’re looking for the best meme coins to join now, BTFD Coin stands head and shoulders above the rest. Don’t miss your chance to ride this wave. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in the next big thing in crypto.

DAOs are organizations represented by rules encoded as computer programs, controlled by the token holders related to that organization and not influenced by a central authority.  The plan involves using Morpho Labs' vaults to manage USDC and USDT targeting a conservative 7% annual return through strategies that include high-quality collaterals like USTB, sUSDS, and stUSD.  That could make Polygon an additional $70 million yearly from idle assets. The yield generated would be reinvested back into the Polygon ecosystem, supporting growth across the network and its ecosystem.  If the idea passes an initial community check, the proposal will aim to generate yield by gradually deploying dai (DAI), USD Coin (USDC) and tether (USDT) from reserves into decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.  Deploying each asset will require a separate proposal to be floated and passed by the community in the future.

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | FIAT | SHIB,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/elons-gold-elongold-memecoin-will-explode-over-18000-before-exchange-listings-while-shiba-inu-and-dogecoin-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

The streamlined architecture incorporates advancements in mathematical problem-solving. Per the reports, the new model, boasting 14 billion parameters, aims to compete with other compact AI models like GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and Claude 3.5 Haiku. According to Microsoft’s blog , Phi-4 is available with limited access through Microsoft’s Azure AI Foundry platform and is restricted to research purposes under a Microsoft research license agreement. Phi-4: Enhanced performance in mathematical reasoning Microsoft has positioned Phi-4 as a leader in mathematical problem-solving, citing substantial performance gains over both its predecessors and comparable models. The company is confident about the AI model’s capabilities after Phi-4 reportedly achieved top marks in several standardized benchmarks. Source: Microsoft In the GPQA test, it scored 56.1, outperforming GPT-4o’s 40.9 and Llama-3’s 49.1. On the MATH benchmark, Phi-4 achieved 80.4, reflecting its advanced capabilities in tackling complex mathematical problems. It also excelled in coding benchmarks, achieving a score of 82.6 on HumanEval. Additionally, Phi-4 demonstrated its prowess in real-world scenarios, including high scores on problems from the Mathematical Association of America’s American Mathematics Competitions (AMC-10/12). These results indicate potential applications in scientific research, engineering, and financial modeling, fields where mathematical accuracy and reasoning are critical. Source: Microsoft While larger models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini Ultra operate with hundreds of billions or even trillions of parameters, Phi-4 demonstrates that smaller, streamlined architectures can achieve superior performance in specialized tasks. Microsoft credits Phi-4’s advancements to the integration of high-quality synthetic data alongside datasets of human-generated content, as well as undisclosed improvements made during post-training. These efforts reflect a broader trend in the AI industry , where research teams are increasingly focusing on innovations in synthetic data usage and post-training optimization. Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang recently highlighted this shift, remarking that the industry has hit a “pre-training data wall,” adding that companies will now race towards developing more efficient AI models. Compute matters, but so does data, and we have reached a pre-training data wall. Get ready for the post-training data boom.

In a statement released on Dec. 12, the PRA urged firms to outline their “current and expected future cryptoasset exposures” and detail their compliance with the Basel framework for regulating crypto activities. “This will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on cryptoassets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures, [and] analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options,” the PRA stated. The Basel framework, introduced by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2022, defines capital and risk management standards for banks exposed to cryptocurrencies. The PRA aims to use the collected data as a foundation for monitoring the financial stability risks posed by crypto assets. Firms are required to account for their crypto-related plans extending through September 30, 2029. The PRA’s questionnaire highlights critical areas of interest, including firms’ application of the Basel framework and their use of permissionless blockchains. “While there are benefits that these new types of ledgers can bring, they also pose risks such as lack of settlement finality, settlement failure, and no guaranteed link between the intended owner of the asset and the entity that may have control of the authentication, validation mechanism,” the questionnaire states. The PRA emphasized that risks tied to permissionless blockchains “cannot be sufficiently mitigated at present” but noted that the classification remains under review.

The criticism came as part of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit backed by Coinbase, Paul Grewal, the Chief Legal Officer of the exchange, revealed in a recent post on X . Judge Says FDIC Appears to Lack Good-Faith Effort In a December 12 text order, Washington, DC, District Court Judge Ana Reyes expressed her concerns, stating that the FDIC appeared to lack a “good-faith effort” in its approach to redactions. “Defendant cannot simply blanket redact everything that is not an article or preposition,” Judge Reyes wrote, calling for “more thoughtful redactions” and instructing the FDIC to refile the letters by January 3. The judge also warned that the FDIC should be ready to justify each redaction. The “pause letters” have sparked controversy in the crypto industry. The letters, which in some cases have entire pages redacted, were sent to 23 financial institutions, urging them to halt or avoid expanding their crypto-related services and products. “What is [the FDIC] working so hard to hide?” Grewal said, arguing that the letters supported the long-standing belief in the crypto industry that the Biden administration was attempting to sever crypto’s access to financial services — a strategy referred to as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0.” He previously called out the FDIC for using “way overbroad redactions” in the letters. We appreciate the Court's careful consideration. What is @FDICgov working so hard to hide? 3/3 — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) December 12, 2024 The controversy surrounding the FDIC’s handling of the letters is set against a broader backdrop of potential regulatory shake-ups. The Wall Street Journal reported that Donald Trump’s presidential transition team had discussed merging or eliminating regulatory agencies like the FDIC. His advisors are also considering changes to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. Coinbase to Shift Toward More Revenue Streams Under Trump Last month, Tom Duff Gordon, Coinbase’s Vice President of International Policy, said the exchange aims to shift toward more predictable revenue streams, such as stablecoin fees, staking rewards, and subscription services under Trump. “We want to build an earnings profile that isn’t entirely dependent on market volatility,” he explained. As Trump prepares to take office, the expectation of reduced regulatory friction offers hope for U.S.-based exchanges like Coinbase. Gordon reiterated the company’s commitment to the American market, stating, “The U.S. will continue to be our most important market.

These investment vehicles aim to provide exposure to tokens tied to Ethereum's ecosystem. The announcement highlights Grayscale’s strategy to back projects improving Ethereum's scalability, security, and adoption in decentralized finance (DeFi). Both Lido DAO and Optimism operate on Ethereum and have shown potential to enhance the blockchain's efficiency. Despite experiencing price fluctuations, both protocols have recently rebounded, aided by technological advancements that increase their utility. Grayscale's new Trusts capitalize on these developments, reflecting confidence in their ability to contribute to Ethereum’s broader adoption. Optimism, a rollup scaling solution for Ethereum, has had a volatile year, with significant price drops followed by recovery thanks to the crypto market's resurgence. It plays a key role in making Ethereum transactions faster and more affordable. Meanwhile, Lido, a leading Ethereum staking platform, has faced its share of challenges, including a bug in April that negatively impacted its reputation. However, it bounced back with positive updates, such as integrating Chainlink CCIP in October , further cementing its place in the DeFi landscape. Grayscale emphasized that both Trusts align with its mission to support projects vital to Ethereum's ecosystem. These protocols not only increase the blockchain's scalability but also bolster security and adoption across various DeFi applications. By launching these Trusts, Grayscale aims to provide investors with opportunities to benefit from the growth of Ethereum-linked solutions. Grayscale has employed a similar approach in the past, introducing Trusts that offer exposure to other crypto assets. Earlier this year, the firm converted a Trust into a Bitcoin ETF and added new Trusts for other assets, including XRP and XLM. While its Ethereum ETF has underperformed, Grayscale sees stronger momentum in these Ethereum-linked projects, positioning Lido DAO and Optimism as promising investments. Both protocols share a focus on enhancing Ethereum's capabilities. Optimism helps scale Ethereum by processing transactions more efficiently, while Lido allows users to stake their Ether more easily. This shared utility underscores why Grayscale sees them as integral to Ethereum’s evolution. Grayscale's decision to launch these Trusts reflects confidence in the potential of Lido DAO and Optimism to drive Ethereum's growth. By addressing key challenges in scalability and staking, these projects have rebounded from setbacks and positioned themselves as critical players in the DeFi space. Through these new Trusts, Grayscale continues to diversify its offerings, providing investors with a broader range of crypto-based opportunities. The firm’s focus on Ethereum-connected products signals its commitment to supporting blockchain innovations that drive adoption and efficiency.

It initiated a fresh surge and flipped through the aforementioned resistance to where it is sitting at around $4.8. Looking at the current daily candle formation, trading volatility appears high on the day. A massive explosion from the current trading level could see the price test $10 in the next few days. The $5 level could pose a little threat to the bulls on a lower timeframe before advancing higher. However, it is important to note that the steady increase in the volume indicator has positioned the asset in a more bullish condition. If it drops, the price may pull back to test the rising trendline before rebounding. No signs of selling at the moment. If the price breaks below this rising trendline, SUI may temporarily be subject to a bearish action for a while.

Hong Kong ‘s regulated crypto broker OSL Digital Securities has added Toncoin ( TON ) to its over-the-counter trading services, allowing professional investors to trade the token.

As crypto.news reported in May, the Open Network allegedly secured over $250 million in funding from the Californian venture capital giant. At the time, Pantera Capital said it had decided to invest in TON as the platform “has the capacity to introduce crypto to the masses because it is used extensively within the Telegram network.” In early December, reports revealed that Pantera Capital raised an additional $20 million to further invest in Toncoin, maintaining its support for the Telegram-linked blockchain.

37579441,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ukraine-to-legalize-crypto-by-2025,1734079733,Ukraine to Legalize Crypto by 2025,"Ukraine is set to legalize cryptocurrencies by early 2025, focusing on clear regulations and taxation without offering any special tax incentives. The proposed legislation aims to regulate digital assets, ensuring financial stability while addressing risks such as tax evasion and money laundering. The draft law, developed with input from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), will impose taxes on cryptocurrency profits converted into fiat currency, treating them similarly to securities trading. A working group is finalizing the bill, with a first parliamentary reading expected in early 2025. This framework will emphasize compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) standards and prioritize economic transparency. Daniil Getmantsev, head of the tax committee of the Verkhovna Rada, highlighted that tax exemptions for crypto transactions were ruled out to prevent potential misuse. The goal is to avoid creating opportunities for tax evasion while aligning with global regulatory practices. In the midst of its conflict with Russia, Ukraine sees cryptocurrency as a tool for financial security. Digital assets offer alternatives for cross-border transactions, helping citizens bypass disrupted traditional banking systems. Cryptocurrencies have already proven their value in humanitarian efforts, raising nearly $70 million for Ukraine’s defense and aid initiatives in 2023. Ukraine’s move reflects broader global trends. Russia recently banned crypto mining in occupied Ukrainian regions but softened its domestic crypto tax policies, exempting transactions from VAT and capping income tax on crypto earnings at 15%. Meanwhile, Morocco is drafting regulations to replace its 2017 crypto ban, and Argentina is exploring Bitcoin payments by 2025 to expand currency freedom. Ukraine’s efforts to legalize cryptocurrencies signal a significant step toward integrating digital assets into its financial system while ensuring transparency and fiscal accountability . The initiative also demonstrates how cryptocurrencies can offer economic resilience during times of crisis, aligning with the global shift toward regulated crypto adoption.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | MINING | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/ukraine-to-legalize-crypto-by-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37579441.jpeg

Due to a significant drop in buy volume, the price has remained stagnant as it decides on the next major move. If not all, most gaming assets have reset back to their local bottom amid past months of broader market correction. But NOT is still trading nicely above its launch price as it fell to a low $0.0085 in the last drawback. It held that low-level as support and increased to $0.0127 on Tuesday. Since then, NOT has found it difficult to advance higher due to an extremely drop in volatility. It is now trading calmly at $0.012. A drop from this trading level could trigger another drawdown capable of bringing the bears back in action from a short-term perspective. On the other hand, if the crypto manages to advance higher with a weekly close above the $0.013, we can expect more growth in the next few days. But technically, the bears are likely to regain control. So far, Notcoin has traded more than $137 million in terms of volume as it lost 2% in the past 24 hours. While the gaming token remains bearish on the daily chart, it may post more losses if the supply level continues to increase. NOT’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Aside from the $0.0085, which stands as weekly low, the $0.00915 level is considered as closest support for a potential drop. A dip below these supports could send the price to $0.0058 and $0.005. In case of an increase, the $0.0145 level would be the next target to watch, followed by $0.018.

However, despite this week’s reduction, it remains strongly bullish monthly. BNB’s bullish trajectory remains valid from a long-term perspective but there has been a little setback in the market following a sudden price crash below the vital $700 level two days ago. This crash was followed by a rejection after printing a new high at $793 a week ago. The bulls failed to sustain momentum and temporarily lost track as they appeared exhausted on the intraday trading. However, the crypto recovered back above the vital level after holding the $642 level as support. The bulls appeared to be stepping back slowly and are now looking set for a fresh increase on a daily scale. Although buying volume might appear low at the moment, we can expect a notable increase in the next few days. Such a surge should bring a significant recovery in the recent crash and also activates a stronger rally. Currently, there’s no sign of a reversal as the bulls continue to dominate monthly. BNB must drop below the $500 level before considering a short-term shift in the market structure. As of now, the bulls are still in control. BNB Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the price is back above $700, the potential resistance levels to keep in mind are $721.8, $761 and $793.9 – the current high. Pushing above these levels could set the market up for a bigger move to $900. While there’s no room for selling, the holding support level right now is $687.7, followed by $642.

Which Company is Buying? Here Are the Details,"Chainlink’s native token, LINK, rose to nearly $31 during Asian trading hours on Friday, reaching its highest level since early 2021. Chainlink (LINK) Rises to 2021 Levels as World Liberty Financial Increases Its Holdings The price increase came as open interest (OI) in LINK futures reached $860 million, signaling growing investor excitement. The rally came after news that World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency platform backed by the Trump family, significantly increased its holdings in LINK. The platform bought $1 million worth of LINK on Thursday, bringing its total LINK holdings to $2 million for the second day of purchases in a row. It also added $246,000 worth of Aave (AAVE) tokens, bringing its total token holdings to $1.2 million. LINK is currently the fourth-largest asset in World Liberty Financial's portfolio, behind Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and Tether (USDT). Why Is World Liberty Financial Buying LINK? World Liberty Financial is leveraging Chainlink’s oracle services to develop its platform that offers cryptocurrency lending, borrowing, and stablecoin transactions. Chainlink provides the platform with: Real-time pricing data. Cross-chain interoperability infrastructure. Chainlink’s oracles connect blockchains to real-world data and external systems, making their services essential for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. LINK tokens are used to compensate Chainlink node operators, tying the utility of the token directly to platform adoption. The market has responded positively to World Liberty Financial’s investment. LINK prices have increased by 22% in the past week and are up more than 130% since World Liberty Financial began using Chainlink’s services. With LINK reclaiming its 2021 highs and increasing adoption of Chainlink’s services, the token looks set to gain sustainable momentum in the evolving DeFi and crypto landscape. *This is not investment advice.

37579500,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319234,1734079197,Key Leader in Digital Euro Efforts Resigns to Quash German Bias Claims,"The leader of the European Parliament’s digital euro resigned to dispel suspicions that he was deliberately blocking the legislation. Stefan Berger, who led the European Parliament’s digital euro efforts, clarified that he resigned to avoid suspicion that the German center-right was stalling this critical project, Politico reported Thursday. The initiative aims to establish a unified digital currency across the eurozone. Berger said it’s time for someone outside Germany , free from suspicion of delaying talks, to take over. Markus Ferber, a German and the center-right coordinator for economic files, is expected to choose Berger’s replacement within a week. One candidate under consideration is Fernando Navarrete Rojas, a former central banker from Spain, Politico said. The digital euro project aims to create a virtual version of euro coins and banknotes, improving domestic payments in the eurozone while reducing reliance on foreign payment providers. However, privacy remains a key concern , especially in Germany, where skepticism is highest among eurozone nations. Nearly half of Germany’s population struggles to imagine using the digital euro. Small German Banks Raise Alarmed Over Digital Euro’s Potential to Trigger Bank Runs Concerns are growing over the potential risks, particularly among smaller financial institutions. Small German banks worry that the European Central Bank’s digital currency design could drain savings from accounts, weakening their funding. This concern is amplified by widespread public skepticism in Germany, where many prefer cash and distrust digital payment systems, often associating them with surveillance—a sentiment rooted in historical experiences with authoritarian regimes. Berger pointed out that banks fear the digital euro could lead to sudden deposit withdrawals, potentially triggering destabilizing bank runs at smaller institutions. Once transferred, it’s no longer the bank’s money, Berger has said, adding that the average deposit at a small German bank is about €3,000. Over time, Berger became more sympathetic to these concerns, eventually concluding that central bank control over digital infrastructure should be limited. He told Politico that he focused on quality rather than rushing implementation, ensuring structural factors were thoroughly considered. Stefan Berger Faced Criticism for Stalling Digital Euro Progress Earlier this year, opposing MEPs voiced dissatisfaction with Berger’s handling of the digital euro project. They urged Parliament coordinators to ensure that Berger or any rapporteur would fully commit to advancing the project. They accused him of failing to schedule meetings, arguing that his approach undermined democratic processes. Meanwhile, the ECB and the European Commission are pushing to speed up the legislative process. Ursula von der Leyen has tasked Economy Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis with achieving quick progress on the matter. Joachim Nagel, President of the Deutsche Bundesbank, earlier predicted the digital euro would launch between 2028 and 2029 . He assured potential users that privacy would remain a top priority.

37578980,https://coinpaprika.com/news/judge-challenges-fdic-on-crypto-transparency,1734078986,Judge Challenges FDIC on Crypto Transparency,"District Court Judge Ana C. Reyes in Washington DC has criticized the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for its excessive redactions in Coinbase-related documents from 2022. These letters, which discouraged banks from engaging in crypto-related activities, have sparked concerns within the crypto community about regulatory overreach. Judge Reyes accused the FDIC of a “lack of good faith” in how it handled the documents, ordering the agency to review and revise the redactions. The court set a firm deadline of January 3 for the updated disclosures, reflecting the judge’s dissatisfaction with the FDIC's approach. This ruling comes after Coinbase made persistent efforts to obtain these documents and subsequently sued the FDIC for greater transparency. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, highlighted the court’s decision on social media, questioning the FDIC's motives. Crypto advocates see these developments as part of a broader debate around “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” a term used to describe perceived anti-crypto efforts within the regulatory framework. The letters, which advised banks to avoid crypto businesses, are seen as a key element of this alleged initiative. This case unfolds during a time of shifting federal attitudes toward cryptocurrency regulation. FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg is set to step down by Inauguration Day, and discussions about potential replacements are underway. While no official decision has been made, names such as former Binance.US CEO Brian Brooks have been mentioned. Many in the crypto sector view this leadership change as an opportunity for a more crypto-friendly approach at the FDIC. Adding to the optimism, Trump’s “crypto czar,” David Sacks, has pledged to prevent another Operation Choke Point. Such commitments suggest that the federal government may be softening its stance on cryptocurrency, encouraging advocates to push for fairer policies. The legal battle between Coinbase and the FDIC underscores the tension between regulators and the growing crypto industry. However, recent developments offer hope for greater transparency and a more balanced regulatory environment. While the outcome of this case remains uncertain, the evolving attitudes in federal policy signal a potential shift in how cryptocurrencies are treated within the U.S. financial system .",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/judge-challenges-fdic-on-crypto-transparency,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37578980.jpeg

With Bitcoin finally crossing over the $100,000 mark, everyone is anticipating new all-time highs for the top cryptocurrencies in the market. As XRP trades at $2.38, recent developments in the regulatory landscape and market sentiment have added to the optimism about its future. To explore whether XRP could reach new heights soon, we turned to ChatGPT for insights into its potential price on Christmas Day. ChatGPT’s Prediction for XRP ChatGPT forecasts that XRP could reach $4 by Christmas Day, a significant 68% increase from its current price of $2.38. If this prediction materializes, XRP will surpass its $3.84 all-time high set in 2018. This surge is underpinned by several factors, as outlined by ChatGPT. Market momentum was at the top of ChatGPT’s list of positive features. The broader cryptocurrency market has been recovering, with many tokens experiencing multi-year highs. XRP has mirrored this trend, gaining 233% over the past month. ChatGPT explained that XRP benefits from overall market sentiment, which is shifting toward optimism as major cryptocurrencies regain lost ground. After breaking above $2 for the first time since 2018 and reaching a six-year high of $2.86, XRP has demonstrated a strong bullish trend. ChatGPT emphasized, “XRP’s recent breakout above significant resistance levels demonstrates robust investor confidence, which could catalyze further upward momentum.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Regulatory changes have also been a key factor. The announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, effective January 20, 2025, has generated optimism within the crypto community. President-elect Donald Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins , a crypto-friendly figure, to succeed Gensler has further bolstered confidence. According to many experts, the nomination of a crypto-friendly SEC Chair could lead to the dismissal of Ripple’s lawsuit and a favorable regulatory climate expected to boost investor sentiment and XRP’s price. While these developments will take full effect in early 2025, the excitement they bring has already helped the crypto market significantly and could still help XRP grow. Beyond regulation, XRP continues to expand its role in global financial systems, particularly in cross-border payments and liquidity solutions. ChatGPT noted that XRP’s utility in financial systems continues to expand, and this adoption may attract more institutional investors , driving the token’s price higher. These factors collectively position XRP for further growth in the near term, and it could reach the $4 level if things play out as predicted.

Meanwhile, the industry already displayed optimism, with Bitcoin skyrocketing past $100K following Trump-driven rallies . Such sentiments have seen many individuals hunting for profitable projects, and iDEGEN appears to stand out. The AI cryptocurrency is witnessing renewed interest from investors, testified by its fast-paced ICO. The project has raised over $4.7 million, with approximately 1 billion coins sold. Source – iDEGEN That underscores confidence and loyalty in iDEGEN. Let’s check what experts expect from the market in 2025 and whether that would keep iDEGEN elevated after its January official launch. Bad players out of the crypto market The digital assets sector seems to have seen everything, from losing billions to fraudsters to ‘billionaires’ collapsing their empires due to greed. However, the latest events have also cleansed the industry. We’ve witnessed malicious individuals like Sam Bankman-Fried jailed and scam platforms eliminated. Also, the former Binance CEO admitting his wrongdoings and serving his time opens the doors for the industry’s purification and recovery. Upcoming regulatory clarity The crypto market braces for regulatory changes to ensure clarity for investors, the public, and businesses. While Gary Gensler’s SEC leadership dented the digital assets sector in the past two years. Meanwhile, progressive developments such as Europe’s MiCA framework are shaping the industry. Donald Trump has already picked Gensler’s replacement, a pro-crypto entrepreneur. Also, Ukraine’s decision to regulate cryptocurrencies early next year paints a bullish picture for digital assets.

For instance, the latest bull rally saw meme tokens like PEPE flying to new all-time highs as old coins broke their nearest resistances. However, themed tokens have faced criticism lately , which could see crypto players switching to stable technologies such as AI. The latest developments have signaled increased integration between crypto and artificial intelligence. iDEGEN appears ready to dominate the AI crypto industry in the upcoming years with its unique approach and pricing model . What is iDEGEN and why it could drive markets in 2025 Experts believe AI will be among the top narratives in the cryptocurrency space in the upcoming months and years. iDEGEN is an innovative experiment that’s grabbing the attention of crypto investors with its never-seen-before performance. The project has raised over $4.7 million less than 20 days after its launch. Moreover, its price has soared by 21,000% to $0.0233 at press time. iDEGEN is an AI crypto project that uses data from the digital assets community to learn everything. It will post hourly on X (formerly Twitter) “with no moderation or training guardrails” and reply to each tweet. The upcoming year presents lucrative opportunities for the crypto market through enhanced regulations and technological innovations. Enthusiasts will likely be watching trends that will shape the much-awaited altcoin season. With AI expected to dominate cryptocurrency trends, iDEGEN’s performance sets it for massive surges after its official launch in January.

Let’s explore why these are the best altcoins to buy now for December 2024, blending short-term gains with long-term utility. Qubetics: dVPN Redefining Privacy and Internet Freedom Qubetics is not just a token; it’s a movement aimed at solving real-world problems. Its decentralised VPN (dVPN) technology offers a secure and private way to access the internet without relying on centralised servers. Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN eliminates the risks of data breaches and censorship by distributing network operations across nodes globally. Imagine a journalist working in a country with strict internet censorship. By using Qubetics’ dVPN, they can access restricted information and communicate securely without fear of surveillance. Similarly, small businesses relying on sensitive data transfers benefit from enhanced security and cost-efficiency compared to traditional solutions. Qubetics has raised over $5.7 million in its 12th presale stage, attracting more than 8,700 investors. For investors, the potential of Qubetics is backed by impressive numbers. At $0.0311 per token, a $2,000 investment yields 64,308 tokens. Analysts project $TICS to reach $5 post-presale, translating into a staggering 15,964.30% ROI. Should it climb to $6, the returns skyrocket to 19,177.16%, or $385,848. These numbers highlight why Qubetics is one of the best altcoins to buy now for both societal impact and financial growth. To learn more about Qubetics’ innovative approach, watch their informative video .

As of December 2024, Filecoin has partnered with prominent healthcare providers to securely store and manage patient records. This initiative ensures data privacy while offering a scalable and affordable alternative to traditional storage solutions. Imagine a hospital in a rural area utilising Filecoin to digitise and store patient records. This decentralised approach not only saves costs but also ensures the data remains accessible to authorised personnel even during system outages or cyberattacks. With healthcare data breaches on the rise, Filecoin’s secure and tamper-proof network offers a timely solution. Filecoin’s achievements extend beyond healthcare. Its decentralised storage system is gaining traction across industries, making it one of the best altcoins to buy now for those who prioritise privacy and reliability in data management. As adoption grows, so does its potential for long-term returns. Cosmos: Expanding Blockchain Interoperability Cosmos is taking the lead in blockchain interoperability, enabling different networks to communicate seamlessly. December 2024 marks a pivotal moment as Cosmos announces a collaboration with major decentralised finance (DeFi) platforms to enhance cross-chain functionalities. This move positions Cosmos as a critical player in bridging blockchain silos, opening up endless possibilities for developers and businesses. Consider a developer building a decentralised application (dApp) that requires functionalities from multiple blockchains. Instead of facing compatibility issues, Cosmos’ Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol simplifies the process, reducing costs and time. This interoperability accelerates innovation, making Cosmos a cornerstone of the next wave of blockchain technology. For investors, Cosmos’ expanding ecosystem and real-world utility cement its place as one of the best altcoins to buy now. Its role in shaping a connected blockchain future ensures its relevance for years to come.

Qubetics’ dVPN technology addresses critical privacy concerns while offering unparalleled ROI potential. Filecoin’s decentralised storage solutions are revolutionising healthcare and beyond.

37578797,https://coinpaprika.com/news/argentina-plans-bitcoin-freedom-in-2025,1734078630,Argentina Plans Bitcoin Freedom in 2025,"Argentine President Javier Milei has announced major policy changes for 2025, aiming to transform the nation's financial landscape with free currency circulation and cryptocurrency-friendly regulations. These reforms will allow Argentines to use any currency for transactions, including Bitcoin, fostering greater financial freedom and flexibility. Milei’s plan also includes a 90% reduction in national taxes , empowering provinces to create their own tax policies. This bold move seeks to decentralize economic decisions, reduce financial pressure on citizens, and promote localized economic growth. Supporters see this policy as a step toward creating true competition between fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Currently, tax laws impose income tax on Bitcoin transactions but exempt those involving dollars or euros, discouraging the use of Bitcoin as a currency. By addressing these disparities, Argentina could follow a path similar to El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption but with strategies adapted to its economic needs. Argentina has already begun integrating cryptocurrency into its legal and financial systems. In 2023, the government legalized Bitcoin contracts, paving the way for wider crypto usage. Milei’s leadership further solidifies this direction, positioning Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as key components of the country’s economic transformation. While some critics express concern over the increasing regulatory burden on the crypto sector, others view Milei’s policies as a necessary step toward reducing the state’s role in the economy. Ricardo Mihura, President of ONG Bitcoin Argentina, highlighted that government-imposed regulations are increasing costs and undermining Bitcoin’s decentralized principles. Argentina’s embrace of cryptocurrency mirrors a larger trend in South America. Brazil, for example, is working on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in collaboration with Chainlink and Microsoft, while leading the region in crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Venezuela’s cryptocurrency market has also seen remarkable growth, surging 110% year-over-year in Q2 2024 and reaching $11.7 billion. South America’s rising momentum in crypto adoption positions the region as a potential global leader in the digital economy. Under Milei’s forward-looking policies, Argentina is playing a central role in this shift. By fostering competition among currencies and embracing innovative financial technologies, the country could set a precedent for others to follow.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | FIAT | LINK | MARKET | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaprika,https://coinpaprika.com/news/argentina-plans-bitcoin-freedom-in-2025,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37578797.jpeg

37578771,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=662043,1734078612,Solana Price On The Rise: Key Resistance At $235 Could Spark Major Breakout,"Over the past week, the Solana price has reflected broader market trends, experiencing a slight decline of 1.3% in the last 24 hours. This decrease has led SOL to retest a crucial support level at $226. Despite this recent dip, experts believe that a successful breach of the $235 resistance could signal a continuation of the uptrend observed over the past six weeks. Is The Solana Price About To Hit New All-Time Highs? Market analysts report that Solana has shown resilience, rebounding towards the $230 mark after briefly hitting the $200 zone. If SOL can maintain momentum and surpass the $235 threshold, it may break the current price compression, potentially targeting a previous high of $264 in the near term. The co-founders of the market intelligence platform Glassnode, Yan Happel and Jan Allemann, noted that Solana’s daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, indicating that there is room for upward movement without being overbought. In this context, they also suggest that if SOL gains traction, investors should monitor other tokens such as Jupiter (JUP) and Dogwifhat (WIF) for potential upward momentum. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Bulls Aim Higher As SHIB Sights $0.00002960 For A Fresh Rally Despite trading at $226—13.5% below its all-time high of $263 achieved on November 23—The Solana price action is closely tied to broader market dynamics, particularly the anticipated regulatory framework under the incoming Trump administration. Experts believe that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could enhance the likelihood of approving spot Solana exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that have been filed by various asset managers earlier this year. Such approvals could pave the way for increased institutional adoption, a scenario that could significantly impact the Solana price and act as a catalyst on its path for new highs in the coming months. Comparative trends in Bitcoin suggest that similar institutional actions could lead to substantial price gains; for example, Bitcoin reached a record peak above $73,000 just two months after its ETF approval in January of this year. Solana Surpasses Ethereum As Top Ecosystem For New Developers A recent report by Electric Capital highlights Solana’s growth as the leading ecosystem for new developers in 2024. This marks a significant achievement, as it is the first time since 2016 that any ecosystem has surpassed Ethereum in attracting new developers. In 2024 alone, Solana welcomed 7,625 new developers. However, Solana not only outpaced Ethereum but also emerged as the fastest-growing large ecosystem, with an impressive 83% year-over-year growth in monthly active developers.

This move is seen as a significant win for the crypto industry, which hopes for more favorable oversight under his leadership. Hill’s appointment, following a competitive process against Reps. Andy Barr, Frank Lucas, and Bill Huizenga, has been welcomed by the digital asset community. Known for his expertise in financial matters, Hill has been a strong advocate for innovation in the crypto sector while emphasizing the importance of balanced regulation. The House Financial Services Committee oversees key areas such as the Federal Reserve, Wall Street, and digital assets. Hill’s leadership is expected to bring a pro-crypto approach to these responsibilities. His past efforts in promoting legislation to regulate cryptocurrencies reflect his commitment to fostering growth in this emerging industry. Upon accepting the role, Hill expressed gratitude and a determination to address ongoing challenges. One of the most pressing issues involves the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which has been accused of unfairly restricting crypto businesses’ access to banking . This criticism follows a federal court ruling by Judge Ana C. Reyes, who rebuked the FDIC for its lack of transparency and over-redacted communications. These actions have been described as part of ""Operation Chokepoint 2.0,"" an alleged initiative to limit the banking options for crypto firms. Hill has vowed to tackle these restrictive practices, ensuring fair treatment for the crypto sector. In a recent statement, he affirmed the committee’s readiness to collaborate with the incoming administration to reverse these policies and conduct a thorough investigation into the FDIC's actions. His commitment to addressing these issues underscores his belief in the potential of digital assets to contribute to the economy. The cryptocurrency community has reacted positively to Hill’s appointment, viewing it as a step toward regulatory clarity and innovation. With his guidance, the committee is expected to work on reforms that balance support for digital asset growth with adequate consumer protection. As Hill begins his tenure, the financial sector is optimistic about a more cooperative and forward-thinking regulatory environment. The upcoming period could be pivotal for the crypto industry as it seeks to expand access to banking and establish a more solid foundation within the U.S. financial system. Hill’s leadership comes at a critical juncture for cryptocurrencies, offering hope for a more inclusive approach to financial innovation.

HyperLiquid, the leading on-chain perpetuals trading protocol operating on its custom-built layer 1 blockchain, is setting impressive records, too, with the platform seeing more activity in ether (ETH) than bitcoin.  The cumulative perpetuals volume on the platform has surged past $500 billion, registering a staggering 15-fold year-to-date rise, according to DefiLlama.  The platform has seen an average daily volume of over $5 billion in the past seven days, accounting for over 45% of the total onchain perpetuals market activity of the past 24 hours.  What's more interesting is that ether, not bitcoin, is leading the boom in activity this week. Since Monday, ether perpetuals have registered a cumulative trading volume of $7 billion. That's 18% greater than bitcoin's tally of $5.94 billion, according to data source stats.hyperliquid.xyz.  Ether has also led the growth in the cumulative notional open interest on the platform since late November. At press time, ether perpetuals worth $857.5 million were active, accounting for nearly 25% of the total open interest of $3.49 billion.  The increased activity in ether on HyperLiquid represents sticky capital that could fuel the next leg up in the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value. As of writing, ETH was changing hands at $3,900, representing a 70% year-to-date gain,  CoinDesk data shows.   The success stems from HyperLiquid being a purpose-specific protocol rather than a general all-purpose chain, according to some observers.   ""HyperLiquid's success appears rooted in prioritizing product-market fit, blending institutional-grade performance with DeFi accessibility, such as no KYC requirements. By offering more generous incentives for active traders, Hyperliquid aligns closely with user needs, potentially setting a new standard for future crypto projects,"" algorithmic trading firm Wintermute said in a note shared with CoinDesk.  HYPE is bigger than AAVE  Speaking of market action, HyperLiquid's two-week-old HYPE token is already making waves. The cryptocurrency has surged over 300% since its inception, zooming to a market value of $5.69 billion, bigger than long-established DeFi players like Ethereum's leading lending protocol Aave and Solana-based decentralized exchanges Raydium and Jupiter, according to data source Coingecko.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana bounces back strong, Arbitrum flirts with key levels, and Rollblock emerges as the next big GambleFi contender, with analysts eyeing 50x growth. Table of Contents Solana ETFs face a roadblock as Gensler throws spanner Arbitrum token unlock rattles the Layer 2 community Rollblock brings DeFi to the casino space with blockchain solutions It looks as though Solana is ready for yet another monster rally to the upside as crypto experts weigh up the investment potential of Arbitrum and the fledgling GambleFi protocol Rollblock (RBLK). Find out why Rollblock is being tipped for an astonishing 50x growth this year. Solana ETFs face a roadblock as Gensler throws spanner Solana has bounced from its recent flash crash to $200, adding 5.5% on the last day of trading to reach $225. This shows incredible strength for the Solana ecosystem, which recently put in a new all-time high of $264. Since then, Solana has been struggling as hopes were recently dashed that a spot Solana ETF would be approved by the SEC. Gary Gensler refused the Solana ETFs as one of his last acts in office, leaving Solana bulls to wait until 2025 to see these funds trade on Wall Street. Solana will likely enter price discovery in the weeks ahead, with many traders targeting the $300 level as a likely next move. Arbitrum token unlock rattles the Layer 2 community Arbitrum is also enjoying a deep green daily candle, with a 5.6% gain bringing the Arbitrum price to $0.99. It looks as though Arbitrum is ready to flip the pivotal $1 mark to support during its next leg up, as it recently bounced convincingly from its recent crash to $0.84. In the last month alone, Arbitrum has gained over 57%, earning Arbitrum a place at number 40 in the CoinMarketCap top 100 crypto rankings. An alarming number of Arbitrum tokens are due to be unlocked this week, as 92.6 million Arbitrum tokens will hit the market on December 16th. This has spooked the Arbitrum holder base somewhat, as a large number of these tokens may end up being sold in a move that will suppress short-term price action significantly.

First up, it leverages the mighty Ethereum blockchain to secure all bets and transactions. This does away with any suspicions around bet fixing, as now Rollblock gamers can verify everything. A huge range of over 7,000 classic games, from old favorites such as poker and roulette to exclusive launches like Zeppelin, are offered. These are all fully immersive, AI-powered gaming experiences that will keep gamers engaged and coming back for more. The RBLK token powers the entire platform and is currently available for $0.041 on the Rollblock presale page. Thanks to the Rollblock revenue share scheme, RBLK supply will trend lower over time as each week 60% of regular platform buybacks will be burned from supply. The remaining 40% will find their way back to loyal community members who will likely never sell, as RBLK can be staked for up to 30%. This represents some of the highest APY in all of crypto and is one of the reasons that analysts are predicting phenomenal 50x moves for Rollblock in the coming months.

37579497,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319222,1734078185,Bank of England Demands Firms to Disclose Crypto Exposure by March 2025,"The Bank of England’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), has issued a directive requiring businesses to disclose their current and anticipated exposure to crypto assets by March 2025. In a statement dated December 12 , the PRA said the move aims to bolster financial stability and shape the central bank’s approach to regulating the burgeoning sector. The regulator asked firms to report their “current and expected future cryptoasset exposures” and to outline their application of the Basel framework—a regulatory standard introduced in December 2022 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to set capital and risk management requirements for crypto exposure. Central Bank Seeks to Monitor Crypto’s Impact on Financial Stability The central bank aims to use this information to monitor the financial stability implications posed by the growing role of crypto assets within the financial system. “This will inform work across the PRA and the Bank of England on cryptoassets by helping us calibrate our prudential treatment of cryptoasset exposures, [and] analyze the relative costs and benefits of different policy options.” The directive extends beyond current exposure, with firms required to account for any future plans to engage with crypto assets through to September 30, 2029. The PRA’s questionnaire highlights several critical areas of interest, including how firms are implementing the Basel framework and their use of permissionless blockchains. The regulator expressed specific concerns about permissionless blockchains, citing risks like settlement failures, lack of settlement finality, and the absence of a guaranteed link between asset ownership and control of authentication mechanisms. The PRA noted that, as of now, the risks associated with permissionless blockchains “cannot be sufficiently mitigated,” though it acknowledged that this classification remains under review. This directive comes as more global firms increase their exposure to crypto assets, notably Bitcoin. For example, on November 29, Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive International shifted nearly $50 million worth of Ether into Bitcoin. A day earlier, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet announced plans to raise over $62 million to purchase additional Bitcoin for its treasury, which already holds 1,142 Bitcoin valued at over $114 million. The U.K. to Implement Stablecoin Regulations The United Kingdom is expected to implement regulations for stablecoins within a matter of months, according to Dante Disparte, the global head of policy at Circle. Last month, Economic Secretary to the Treasury Tulip Siddiq also revealed that the country plans to introduce a comprehensive regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency sector early next year. The proposed framework will consolidate regulations for stablecoins and staking services under one unified regime. Notably, the stablecoin market, currently valued at over $200 billion, remains unregulated in the United States. Meanwhile, Singapore has established formal laws for the stablecoin industry. More recently, the United Arab Emirates issued regulatory approval to a new stablecoin, pegged to the UAE dirham. Dubbed ‘AE Coin’, the cryptocurrency is positioning itself as a stablecoin that is fully backed by reserves held within the UAE.

37578374,https://crypto.news/?p=14319031,1734077777,Kraken survey: 73% of crypto holders plan to reinvest in 2025,"A recent Kraken survey shows that attitudes towards crypto are changing, with 55% of Americans believing that crypto assets have real-world uses and 73% plan to reinvest in 2025. A survey conducted by the major crypto exchange Kraken on 2,537 Americans revealed that 55%, whether they own crypto or not, believe that crypto has real-world uses. However, around 29% are still uncertain about its future outlook. Despite this uncertainty, around 73% of respondents who currently hold crypto admitted that they plan to continue investing in digital assets as they enter the new year of 2025. As many as 43% view crypto as being “more secure than the traditional financial system,” compared to the other 30% who disagree. While 52% see it as a promising investment for the long-term. The survey explores how much “crypto myths” still shape people’s perceptions towards investing in crypto and whether attitudes have shifted. One of the most prevailing myths is the belief that crypto is mostly used to facilitate criminal activities. Kraken’s survey revealed 60% of respondents still think crypto fuels illegal acts more than any other asset. Even though the research tells a different story. Read more: Cash, not crypto remains criminal’s preferred tool for illicit finance, study says According to the Chainalysis Crypto Crime 2024 report , only a small portion of crypto-based transactions were found to be linked to criminal activities in 2024, which is around 0.34%. In fact, a study by Crypto ISAC showed that cash is still the preferred tool for criminals engaging in illegal activities. On the other hand, only 8% of respondents believe that crypto is akin to a Ponzi scheme. A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud method which uses funds from new inventors to pay existing investors. Meanwhile, 53% of respondents believe negative attitudes towards crypto are fueled by ignorance and a lack of understanding, emphasizing the importance of crypto education for the wider public. Gen X has the most faith in crypto Data from the Kraken survey show that the age group with the most confidence in crypto is Gen X. According to the survey results, 63% of people aged 45 to 60 years old see crypto as a practical investment. It is believe that Gen X’s prior history of living through two economic crises, the Great Recession of 2008 and the COVID crisis of 2020, have shaped their disbelief in traditionally-held currencies that failed to hold up against high levels of inflation. Gen X is also the generation that brought in the Cypherpunk movement, which means they have experienced dealing with both the traditional finance and the rise of crypto. This varied perspective could help them contextualize crypto’s practical value. On the other hand, Gen Z appears to have the least confidence in crypto. Only 32% of respondents aged 18 to 29 years old believe crypto has practical uses in the real world. This could indicate that younger investors are still navigating the complexities of crypto and the uncertainty surrounding it.

Coinbase had asked for information about the government’s actions against the crypto industry, but the FDIC’s excessive blackouts raised suspicions that they might be hiding important details. JUST IN: Judge Reyes ruled that FDIC didn't do what it was ordered to do. ""The Court is concerned with what appears to be FDICs lack of good-faith effort in making nuanced redactions.

Reyes criticized the FDIC for not following a court order and accused the agency of not being transparent. Coinbase had complained that the redactions were so extensive that it was hard to understand what the FDIC was saying about the government’s actions against crypto. This led the judge to rule against the FDIC, suggesting they were not being open with the court.

This legal fight is part of a bigger concern in the crypto community about government actions against the industry, with some seeing this as part of a broader effort to stifle crypto innovation. Crypto Regulations on Check This case has bigger implications for the future of crypto regulation in the U.S. Many believe it’s connected to a government initiative called “Operation Choke Point 2.0,” which critics argue is aimed at limiting crypto businesses. With the upcoming leadership changes in the U.S. government, things might settle soon. Donald Trump’s win is a sign of a new beginning for crypto. Moreover, SEC Chair Gary Gensler and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg have already stepped down, and Paul Atkin, a pro-crypto figure, is set to replace Gruenberg. Brian Quintenz, who has a crypto-friendly background, may head the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Shiba Inu shows bullish potential despite recent volatility, supported by an active burn mechanism and predictions of significant price spikes. XRP’s price surged over 250% in the past month, with analysts forecasting a new all-time high driven by regulatory progress and market momentum. Pi Network’s Stronghold in South Korea Despite the surrounding controversy, the cryptocurrency project Pi Network continues to amass users. Not long ago, the team revealed the application had exceeded the milestone of 100 million downloads. Pi Network has a solid presence in Asia, creating multi-million communities in countries like China, Vietnam, Singapore, India, Japan, and More. As CryptoPotato recently reported , South Korea is another nation where the project has gained huge popularity. According to Wu Blockchain’s analysis , the number of local Pi Network users has reached 1.34 million, which outnumbers the domestic client base of major crypto exchanges like Binance and Coinbase. In fact, the only two domestic cryptocurrency-related entities having more users are Upbit (4.36 million) and Bithumb (2.24 million). While the global Pi Network community continues to grow, its native token and open mainnet have yet to see the light of day. The team assured it will set things into motion once 15 million users complete the necessary verifications. Latest data shows that 14 million people have already complied with the rules, with only 1 million left to do so. Meanwhile, the Pi Core Team previously promised to announce the mainnet open roadmap, which should provide more clarity on when users will be able to buy and sell Pi tokens. It remains to be seen whether the final weeks of 2024 will bring significant developments or if there will be further delays. SHIB’s Next Potential Targets The second-largest meme coin experienced a substantial revival at the start of December. However, in the past several days, it witnessed enhanced volatility, with its price plunging by over 10% on a weekly scale . SHIB Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the turbulence, numerous analysts remain optimistic that a new rally could be on the horizon . X user JAVON MARKS, for instance, maintained that SHIB has confirmed a bullish pattern, which could be a precursor for “another major upside move.” The trader reiterated their forecast that the price could spike by almost 180% and reach $0.000081. Other market observers predicting good days ahead for the meme coin include Zach Humphries and The Crypto Bull. The former believes that SHIB could chart substantial gains once “Ethereum breaks loose.” The Crypto Bull assumed that Shiba Inu’s chart “looks primed for launch very soon.” The resurgence of the asset’s burning mechanism supports the thesis of a price pump. The burn rate has spiked by almost 300% in the past 24 hours, resulting in 11.8 million tokens sent to a null address. The USD equivalent of the stash might be insignificant, but continuous efforts in that field will make SHIB more scarce and potentially more valuable in time (should demand keep its level or rise). XRP Price Outlook Ripple’s XRP is also in the red on a weekly scale , albeit charting less substantial losses than Shiba Inu. However, the asset remains one of the best performers in the past month, with its price skyrocketing by over 250% and currently trading above $2.30. XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko Some of the factors that have fueled XRP’s impressive spike over the last several weeks include Gary Gensler’s (the current Chairman of the US SEC) announcement that he will step down in January next year and the progress of Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin. Not long ago, CEO Brad Garlinghouse revealed that the financial product received regulatory approval from the NYDFS. Many industry participants believe XRP is now gearing up for another massive rally. X user Ali Martinez recently noted the emergence of a bull flag on the asset’s price chart, predicting a rise to a new all-time high of $4. However, he believes the road to the peak might be bumpy and include a brief correction. Prior to that, he claimed that XRP “looks undervalued after breaking out of this massive multi-year symmetrical triangle.” He set a “conservative target” of $8.40 and an “optimistic” one of a staggering $48.12.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Glassnode says that LINK’s fundamentals are improving along with its active address momentum and rising price tag. “While LINK’s price surge was clearly driven by speculative and short-term market activity, its fundamentals are improving too. Active addresses momentum is trending higher, with the short-term SMA (simple moving average) of 6,682 still above the long-term SMA of 5,878. That said, active addresses remain far below their 2021 peak of 23,416.” Source: Glassnode/X Glassnode goes on to note that LINK hit the highest price it has since 2022 and that its futures open interest has reached a new all-time high, signaling high trading activity. “Chainlink’s token LINK has hit its highest price in nearly two years, and futures open interest (OI) just surged to an all-time high of $770.27 million! For context: LINK OI: $770 million. Toncoin (TON) OI: $259 million. Tron (TRX) OI: $356 million. LINK’s OI is 3x TON and 2x TRX, signaling massive trading activity.” Source: Glassnode/X The crypto analytics firm then breaks down how investors took profits from trading LINK, with ultra short-term and short-term investors realizing the most while long-term holders appeared largely dormant. “We also saw significant profit-taking in the spot market. With $35.57 million in realized profits, yesterday marked the 2nd largest profit-taking event for LINK this year (trailing only Feb 11’s $40.39 million). This profit-taking was driven mostly by speculative market participants: Ultra-short (1 day-1 week): 15.3% Short-term (3-6 months): 22.5%. Long-term holders stayed mostly quiet, except for the 1-2 year cohort (11.6%).” Source: Glassnode/X LINK is trading for $24.96 at time of writing, a 6.5% decrease during the last 24 hours.

French Hill was announced as the new Chairman of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee. It’s a major role that puts him at the center of decisions shaping America’s financial future. Hill’s appointment comes as the previous Chair, Patrick McHenry, steps down. McHenry had nothing but praise for Hill, calling him a strong leader and ally. But why does this matter so much? Source : X.com Hill’s background makes him a standout choice. He’s not just any politician. He’s a big supporter of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, which are shaping the future of finance. It is believed that he will work heavily on reforming the banking sector along with digital assets. If you are a crypto enthusiast, you should definitely keep an eye on this news. A Crypto Advocate Takes the Helm French Hill’s track record shows he’s not afraid to tackle tough issues in the financial world. While the draft of Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) was being drafted, he played a key role in it. This act puts the foundations of rules for handling digital assets, that’s something the crypto space has been asking for. Hill also worked on legislation for stablecoins and improving the crypto market structure. As Chair, he plans to address claims of “debanking,” where financial institutions cut off services to crypto businesses. That’s a big deal for the industry. His election to this position wasn’t a given, though. He won after competing with other experienced Republican contenders. But his colleagues believed in his vision, and now, he’s ready to lead. After he was elected, he shared his regards to everyone who trusted him. “ I am humbled that my colleagues have placed their trust in me to lead the House Financial Services Committee as their next Chairman. It was a privilege to join my exceptional colleagues, Representatives Andy Barr, Bill Huizenga, and Frank Lucas, in sharing our visions for this committee .” .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Abolish FDIC, Boost Crypto: Will Trump’s Plan Help or Hurt the U.S.? , What to Expect What’s next for French Hill?

McHenry is confident Hill will bring clarity to regulations and protect consumers. As the new Congress kicks off in January 2025, Hill’s leadership is expected to shape the future of crypto and financial technologies.

37579489,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52027,1734076636,Trustlines for Ripple’s RLUSD Explodes. Here’s why,"Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD has witnessed a remarkable increase in trustlines following its final approval by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Trustlines are a key XRP Ledger (XRPL) feature that allows users to establish secure connections to specific assets. Recent data highlights a surge in activity for RLUSD, as the stablecoin nears its launch. The data , shared by crypto influencer JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie), reveals a large number of trustline creations on December 11, 2024. Each transaction shows trustlines being established for 1,000,000 RLUSD tokens. Trustlines for @Ripple 's stablecoin, $RLUSD , exploded after RLUSD received its final approval from NYDFS! #XRP pic.twitter.com/WkF34mSmlH — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) December 11, 2024 Ripple made waves in the crypto sector by creating an enormous 10,000 trillion RLUSD trustlines recently, and this increased activity has increased speculation that the stablecoin launch is imminent. RLUSD is crucial for Ripple’s broader strategy to enhance global payment systems. The stablecoin, backed by Ripple and operating on XRPL and Ethereum blockchain, aims to provide fast and secure financial solutions. The approval by NYDFS, a leading regulatory body in the United States, shows the company’s desire to act within the rules of a proper regulatory body while giving its users the best offering on the market. RLUSD offers several advantages. Its decentralized architecture supports efficient transactions, low fees, and seamless cross-border payments. As part of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system, RLUSD is designed to facilitate instant settlement, making it a powerful tool for international trade and finance. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 How Will This Affect XRP? The debate on XRP’s role in the ecosystem is important, as the announcement of RLUSD caused some incorrect speculation that the company was abandoning XRP. Ripple’s system works with both tokens and will use the best asset for each transaction so users always get the cheapest and fastest transactions. XRP is the foundation of the XRPL. It also serves as a bridge currency and performs many other functions like being used for trading fees and more. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz recently delved into the unique roles of both assets , explaining how RLUSD will enhance liquidity on the ledger and help the ecosystem grow. The regulatory approval from NYDFS marks a significant milestone. The implications of RLUSD’s growth extend beyond individual users. Businesses and financial institutions could leverage the stablecoin for secure, cost-effective transactions. Ripple’s broader vision includes enhancing global liquidity and promoting financial inclusion—areas where RLUSD can play a transformative role.

The man leading Parliament’s work on the digital euro, who became one of its biggest critics, has quit to stop claims he was delaying the project on purpose, POLITICO has learned . Berger, a veteran German lawmaker from the center-right European People’s Party, announced his decision to POLITICO, stating that “it’s time for someone [who] is not coming from Germany and is not under suspicion that he wants to delay the talks.” Markus Ferber, who oversees economic issues for the EPP, will choose Berger’s replacement within a week, the report notes. The digital euro, planned as a virtual version of euro coins and notes, aims to improve payments in the eurozone and reduce dependence on foreign companies like Visa and Mastercard . But it has faced pushback, especially from German banks and citizens worried about its design and financial risks. Berger also raised concerns that it could lead to sudden withdrawals, hurting smaller banks. You might also like: ECB and EU governments reportedly clash over digital euro regulation Although Berger helped create MiCA, which will make the EU the first major region with clear crypto rules, he has faced challenges getting similar support for the digital euro. While MiCA gave crypto firms clear rules across the EU, the digital euro has been met with concerns about privacy and its technical details. Berger had proposed a gradual approach, starting with wholesale transactions for the digital euro. However, critics claimed he missed deadlines and slowed progress, leading rival lawmakers to call for his removal earlier this year. The European Central Bank is currently testing the digital euro’s feasibility, with plans for a pilot program in the coming years. Earlier in December, in a digital euro progress report , the regulator implied that it might drop offline digital euro payments if it can’t agree with smartphone makers on secure chip integration.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

Before, it was 647, and at the time of writing it is just 205. https://t.co/SufuVMmeoP pic.twitter.com/knnhTGgTJO — Department Of DOGE Efficiency (@EfficiencyDOGE) December 12, 2024 As Dogecoin works to recover, the attack has raised important questions about the blockchain’s security and its ability to withstand such vulnerabilities in the future. Keep reading to know more. The DogeReaper Exploit Data highlighted by blockchain analytics platform Blockchain, the number of active Dogecoin nodes dropped from 647 to 205 earlier this week. Although some nodes have come back online, bumping the total figure back up to 331 as of now, the event exposes a major weakness in the network design. The hack, named “DogeReaper,” was first discovered by security engineer Tobias Ruck. The exploit allows hackers to remotely trigger segmentation faults in Dogecoin nodes, effectively taking them offline. The attack primarily targeted older nodes running outdated versions of the software, leaving a large portion of the network vulnerable. Hacker Comes Forward Andreas Kohl, a developer at Sequentia, admitted on X to using the DogeReaper vulnerability to attack the network from a decade-old laptop in El Salvador’s countryside. He clarified that the exploit mainly affected older nodes, while centralized exchanges and major custodians were not impacted. “Many Dogecoin users didn’t pay attention because they can use exchanges or have some kind of third party that holds their coins,” Kohl said. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto Weekly Hack Report: Alarming Trends You Should Know , Dogecoin’s Decentralization Weakness Exposed The attack has highlighted a critical flaw in Dogecoin’s decentralized system. Some researchers have compared the DogeReaper exploit to the ‘Death Note’ concept from Japanese manga, where writing a name causes a character to die. Similarly, the exploit can paralyze the network, halting transactions and blocking new blocks from being generated for days. Even with the hack, Dogecoin’s price has remained relatively stable. As of the latest data from CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin is priced at $0.4073, down 2.54%. However, the attack has increased pressure on the Dogecoin team to fix the vulnerability and restore confidence in the network. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Just a “tiny fraction” of BlackRock users own IBIT and ETHA. Tidal CIO Michael Venuto believes Bitcoin will be tied to “every options strategy.” BlackRock, the world’s largest asset management firm, is doubling down on its United States spot Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs), IBIT and ETHA, instead of launching investment products focused on altcoins. Currently, only a small portion of the firm’s customers hold these crypto ETFs, and BlackRock wants to onboard more users. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas discussed the rising popularity and demand for crypto ETFs, referencing quotes from representatives of different digital asset management firms. With recent discussions about XRP and Solana ETFs and the overall market reaching new highs, we can expect more capital inflow.

The figure surpasses the combined inflows of the next 10 largest exchanges, according to Binance’s December 12 report . The exchange attributed its growth to increasing global adoption of digital assets, driven by regulatory progress, record-breaking cryptocurrency prices, and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in key markets like the U.S. and Hong Kong. Binance User Base Reaches 250 Million Binance revealed its user base has surged to nearly 250 million globally, a major milestone in its expansion. Data from DefiLlama places Bybit as the second-largest recipient of customer deposits, with $8.2 billion, followed by OKX with $5.3 billion. BitMEX, Robinhood, and HTX round out the top positions with $3.45 billion, $3.165 billion, and $2.12 billion, respectively. However, exchanges like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, and Crypto.com experienced net outflows of $2.75 billion, $1.77 billion, and $358.1 million. Institutional interest in centralized exchanges (CEXs) is also on the rise. CryptoQuant’s December 3 report shows the average Bitcoin deposit at Binance increased from 0.36 BTC to 1.65 BTC in 2024. Meanwhile, average Tether (USDT) deposits saw a significant jump from $19,600 to $230,000. Binance became the first centralized exchange to surpass $100 trillion in lifetime trading volume, according to CCData. OKX ranks second, trailing with $25 trillion. Despite predictions of a shift toward decentralized exchanges (DEXs) following FTX’s 2022 collapse, CEXs still dominate. “In 2024, we are witnessing a new dawn,"" #Binance CEO @_RichardTeng told @CNBCi , highlighting increased institutional adoption from traditional markets. This shift in momentum will be a key theme at #BinanceBlockchainWeek in Dubai, on Oct 30-31. Full agenda … pic.twitter.com/jowlxn8FMI — Binance VIP & Institutional (@BinanceVIP) October 16, 2024 Data from CoinGecko reveals that CEXs facilitated $276 billion in 24-hour trading volume, dwarfing the $28.5 billion recorded by DEXs. Just recently, stablecoin provider Circle and Binance announced a partnership aimed at expanding the adoption of the dollar-backed stablecoin USDC and digital asset adoption. However, in negative news, Cambodia has blocked access to 16 cryptocurrency exchange websites, including major platforms like Binance, Coinbase, and OKX, as part of its ongoing effort to regulate the digital asset market. Crypto Spot Trading Volume Surges to $2.71 Trillion in November November saw a resurgence in cryptocurrency trading, with monthly spot trading volumes soaring to $2.71 trillion—the highest level since May 2021. The figure represents a more than twofold increase from October’s $1.14 trillion, with Binance dominating the market, processing $986 billion and accounting for 36% of the total volume. Other major exchanges, including Crypto.com, Upbit, and Bybit, also reported impressive performances, each exceeding $200 billion in monthly trading volume. The rally extended to futures markets as well, with Bitcoin futures reaching $2.59 trillion in total trading volume and Ethereum futures hitting $1.28 trillion—both marking their highest levels in over two years. The surge was largely driven by the reelection of pro-crypto Republican Donald Trump as U.S. President on November 6. Furthermore, November was a historic month for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States, with investors pouring $6.4 billion into spot BTC ETFs. The surge in inflows coincided with a month-long rally that saw Bitcoin’s price soar by 45%, reaching an all-time high of $99,000.

The discussion centered on technical patterns, breakout points, and strategic price targets, emphasizing the bullish outlook for XRP both in the short term and through 2025. #XRP HOLDERS WILL BE FILTHY RICH BECAUSE OF THIS! (Price Prediction 2024 – 2025) pic.twitter.com/esdq9eJ6zz — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 11, 2024 Technical Overview In the monthly timeframe, Steph highlighted the confirmed breakout of a W formation, a bullish technical pattern. According to his analysis, XRP has retested the neckline of this formation at approximately $1.96, a level not seen since 2021. XRP began forming this pattern after its all-time high of $3.84 in January 2018. It hit the bottom of the first half in December 2020 when it hit a low of $0.1743, before climbing to the top of the first half in April 2021. The asset began declining after this and hit the bottom of the pattern’s second half in 2024. The asset’s recent rise has completed this pattern, with the retest of the $1.96 level reinforcing the potential for a significant rally. The technical target of the W formation is set at $30–$35, and the asset could hit this level in 2025. XRP has since risen above $1.96 and despite some recent turbulence , the asset is currently trading at $2.36. A rise to $35 represents an increase of over 1,380%. While this target is ambitious, Steph cautioned against relying solely on it, advising XRP holders to lock in profits incrementally during the rally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Short-term Targets Zooming into the daily timeframe, XRP has demonstrated strong bullish momentum since October, rallying to a multi-year high of $2.86. The analyst highlighted XRP’s resilience above its EMA ribbons, which have acted as a support level during recent price consolidations. At the time of press, the price is approaching a critical downward-sloping resistance line, established on December 3. Steph noted that a daily candle close above this trendline, or above the December 9 high of $2.6, would confirm the start of the next impulsive move. XRP’s Performance Against Bitcoin Steph also provided a detailed analysis of XRP’s performance against Bitcoin. XRP has been in a long-term downtrend against BTC since 2018. However, a trend reversal has been evident since November, with XRP now retesting a crucial resistance level that dates back to 2020. On the daily timeframe, XRP is consolidating within a bullish flag pattern against Bitcoin. The analyst believes that a breakout from this pattern could result in XRP outperforming Bitcoin by up to 78%. Some experts are already speculating on XRP’s chances to flip Bitcoin , and this surge would set it on that path.

37576477,https://nulltx.com/?p=135617,1734074114,5 Best New Meme Coins to Invest in This Week: Opportunities You Can’t Afford to Miss,"Imagine scrolling through your crypto portfolio a week from now and seeing numbers you didn’t think were possible. You decided to act when others hesitated, jumping into the hottest meme coins of the week. Now, your portfolio is thriving while others are left wondering how they missed the boat. This week’s meme coin market is bursting with opportunities, and you don’t want to be the one asking, “What if?” BTFD Coin captivates bulls, with its electrifying presale and game-changing ecosystem. Joining it are Dogwifhat, Ponke, Neiro, and Brett, each ready to make their mark. These are the best new meme coins to invest in this week, and the time to act is now. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): Leading the Meme Market When it comes to meme coins, BTFD Coin is in a league of its own. Built on the ethos of “buy the dip,” it’s rallying investors with its high-stakes presale and vibrant community. Why BTFD is the Star of the Week With its presale already in the 11th stage, BTFD Coin has raised over $3.6 million, selling 52 billion tokens for just $0.00012. A $1,250 investment at this stage would secure over 10.4 million BTFD tokens. When the token hits its anticipated listing price of $0.0006, that investment could soar to $6,250. But BTFD is about more than just profits. Its 90% staking APY and the beta release of its P2E game make it a comprehensive ecosystem for growth and engagement. Why This Week is Crucial? BTFD Coin’s presale momentum is building fast, making this the perfect time to secure your spot before the token’s price climbs further. 2. Dogwifhat: The Quirky Contender Dogwifhat combines meme culture with a playful twist. Its unique branding—featuring a dog wearing a hat—has made it a fan favourite among meme coin enthusiasts. The project’s recent collaboration with NFT artists has added a new dimension to its ecosystem. With plans to integrate DeFi utilities in the coming months, Dogwifhat is carving out a niche in the market. Why It’s Worth Your Attention This Week? Dogwifhat’s blend of humour and forward-thinking strategies positions it as a solid choice for investors looking to diversify. 3.

37576470,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392608,1734074098,Ripple Price To Moon Soon? How Gaming and A.I on XRP can Fuel Massive Rally,"The post Ripple Price To Moon Soon? How Gaming and A.I on XRP can Fuel Massive Rally appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ripple is thrilled with the recent approval of RLUSD by New York regulators as they see stablecoins like RLUSD as crucial for improving cross-border payments and simplifying user integration into the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Ripple is also focused on enhancing the network’s functionality, driving adoption, and creating liquidity, with a particular emphasis on sectors like gaming. McDonald Talks XRP’s Market Growth Aaron McDonald, CEO of Futureverse, talked about the current XRP market, noting the recent rise in XRP’s price and the strong support from its community. On The Paul Barron Network , he explained that although they joined Ripple during tough times, they believed in the potential of the loyal XRP community. McDonald described the community as a “loaded spring” ready to bounce back once obstacles were gone. He also said the upcoming RLUSD stablecoin backed by Ripple, could help bring more liquidity and support to the market. Stablecoins, he said, are useful for consumers and everyday transactions, especially in gaming. He’s excited about using this technology in Futureverse’s network. McDonald boasted XRP’s growth, with almost 20,000 trust lines now in place, showing XRP’s growing influence in the ecosystem. With Ripple’s stablecoin approval, XRP is set for growth – read XRP price prediction to see what’s next for this rising cryptocurrency! XRP Drives Root Network Success He explained how XRP is used within their network, calling it the “gas token” for the Root Network. This means that XRP powers everything on the network, from transactions to smart contracts . Over the past year, they’ve seen great progress by turning XRP into a valuable utility. In the first year, $13 billion worth of value was transferred on the network. Root Network validators also earned fees, with nearly 13% of the fees burned on the entire XRP ledger. McDonald aims to scale this success further in the coming year, hoping to 10x growth and increase the utility of XRP even more. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

This massive expiration is expected to trigger significant market movement, creating potential volatility as traders and investors prepare for a busy day. Bitcoin Options Expiring: $3.36 Billion at Stake A large portion of the expirations comes from Bitcoin options. According to Deribit , over 217,000 Bitcoin contracts, valued at approximately $3.36 billion, are set to settle today. With a put-to-call ratio of 0.60, there are more long positions (calls) than short ones (puts), indicating overall bullish sentiment. However, the maximum pain point for Bitcoin stands at $98,000, which is slightly below the current spot price of $99,758. While Bitcoin’s recent rise to $103,000 was notable, a recent price dip has caused liquidations of many leveraged positions. Still, solid buying activity in the spot market suggests optimism, though high funding rates for leveraged positions could lead to potential pullbacks. $900 Million Ethereum Options Expiring Ethereum also has a big expiration today, with over 1.7 million contracts worth around $900 million set to expire. Interestingly, Ethereum traders appear more bullish than Bitcoin traders, with a put-to-call ratio of 0.46. However, the max pain point is at $3,700, which mark is crucial for both bulls and bears, as it will likely determine the next price direction for ETH. Is the Christmas Rally Coming? With options expiring, traders are now wondering if a rally could take place before Christmas. The market shows Bitcoin and Ethereum moving in different directions, with Bitcoin holding below $100,000 and Ethereum staying just under $4,000. The next few days could be crucial, as traders adjust their positions and prepare for the end of the year.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/4-26-billion-in-bitcoin-and-ethereum-options-expires-today-whats-next-for-crypto/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

The cryptocurrency, which had breached the $100K mark last week, had seen a slump in its performance at the start of the week. BTC had fallen as low as $94.3K in the week. ""We view the mid-week price decline being largely due to what was happening in traditional markets; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also hit a low of the week on Tuesday afternoon,"" said Cory Klippsten, CEO of Swan, a Bitcoin financial services firm. Bitcoin's ( BTC-USD ) rally after Donald Trump's win in the elections, seemed to be taking a breather at the beginning of the week, but BTC soon regained its momentum and touched the $100K mark. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) climbed past the six-figure mark once again on Wednesday, driven by inflation data that matched expectations. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that consumer prices rose steadily in November, matching expectations and reinforcing speculation that the Fed will lower rates when it gathers on Dec. 17-18. ""Bitcoin's rally back to $101k demonstrates that investors continue to view Bitcoin favorably, even after significant price gains in the past month,” Klippsten added. BTC also did have a little fumble on Thursday, falling 3% in intraday trading, as comments from ECB President Lagarde's led to a cross-asset sell-off. ECB had cut interest rate by 25bps as expected on Thursday . ""There was disappointment that the ECB didn’t take an even more dovish tone, not least after Lagarde said that inflation risks were 'two-sided,'"" Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid said. The world's largest digital currency, has seen then largely stuck to the $100K threshold. ""Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 and all other asset classes since its inception in 2009, reaching over $100,000 recently,"" Seeking Alpha analyst David Zanoni said. Supply and demand dynamics are crucial to Bitcoin's success, suggesting it will be a significant market outperformer in 2025, Zanoni added. Zanoni also expects the price target for Bitcoin to reach ~$154,000 by about October 2025.

Following a strong market recovery, Ethereum has outperformed many other cryptocurrencies, gaining 6% in the past day, according to CoinGecko. “The gears and bolts are in place,” Iliya Kalchev, an analyst at Nexo, said in an interview. “Ethereum could skyrocket beyond $5,000 by early 2025.” Ethereum is up 79% since Donald Trump’s election victory last month, but it still lags behind its all-time high of $4,800 set in 2021. Comparatively, Bitcoin is up 62% over the same period, while Solana and XRP have gained 59% and 430%, respectively. Related News: Turkey's SEC Announced the List - Blocked Access to Cryptocurrency Exchanges with Very Familiar Names Carlos Guzman, an analyst at market maker GSR, noted Ethereum’s unique position in the market. “ETH has a huge advantage in that it is the only token in the US that has an ETF, besides BTC,” he explained. “As traditional investors become more invested in crypto, they will look to ETH as a natural alternative.” Ethereum’s prospects are further supported by institutional interest. According to Arkham Intelligence, two major financial institutions, BlackRock and Fidelity, are actively accumulating Ethereum, with both purchasing over $500 million worth of ETH since Dec. 8. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Realized Cap Has Crossed The $768 Billion Milestone In a new post on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about the latest trend in the Realized Cap of Bitcoin. The “Realized Cap” here refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates BTC’s total value by assuming the value of each individual token is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals The previous transfer of any coin is likely to correspond to the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all tokens in circulation, it essentially calculates the sum of the cost basis of the Bitcoin supply. In other words, the model measures the total amount of capital that the investors as whole have put into the cryptocurrency. Now, here is the chart for the indicator shared by Young Ju that shows the trend in its value over the entire history of the digital asset: As displayed in the above graph, the BTC Realized Cap has been riding a sharp uptrend during the past year, which suggests capital has rapidly been pouring into the coin. “Bitcoin is attracting $80 billion every month,” notes the CryptoQuant founder. “Nearly half of the capital that has entered the Bitcoin market over the past 15 years was added this year.” Thanks to these impressive inflows, the total BTC investment has almost reached the $769 billion milestone. It’s unclear how long the Realized Cap could continue this sharp trajectory, but for now, it seems there is still plenty of demand for the asset. In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has also discussed about the same metric from a different angle. The above chart shows the cumulative data for the Bitcoin “Realized Profit” and “Realized Loss.” These metrics, as their names imply, measure the amount of profit and loss, respectively, that the investors are realizing or harvesting through their selling. Over the history of the cryptocurrency, the difference between the cost basis and selling price for profitable transactions stands at $1.27 trillion, while that for the underwater transfers is at $592 billion.

37575679,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52021,1734072328,3 Coming Events That Could Drive XRP Price Beyond All-Time High,"XRP has faced significant challenges in recent weeks, including a sharp price decline. After briefly dropping below $2, XRP now trades at approximately $2.42, marking a steep 19.36% loss over the past week. Despite this downturn, three major developments are poised to drive a rebound in the asset’s price, offering hope to investors and enthusiasts: Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Nears Launch: Ripple is preparing to introduce its much-anticipated U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD. The stablecoin has secured final approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), as confirmed by Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse. While the exact launch date is yet to be announced, Ripple is expected to share further updates through its official communication channels soon. RLUSD is designed to enhance Ripple’s ecosystem by facilitating institutional payments and cross-border transactions. By increasing the utility of the token within its network, the stablecoin’s deployment could potentially attract more institutional participation. Analysts predict that this added utility may boost demand for XRP as a bridge currency, further integrating the token into Ripple’s payment infrastructure. Growing Interest: The prospect of XRP-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is gaining momentum, with several asset management firms already filing applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Notable firms such as WisdomTree, 21Shares, and Bitwise have joined the race, alongside Canary Capital, which initiated the process in October. Speculation is also growing that major players like BlackRock could follow suit. Approval of an XRP ETF would provide institutional and retail investors with regulated access to the token, potentially driving significant capital inflows. Drawing parallels to the impact of Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted billions of dollars in investments, an XRP ETF could substantially enhance market liquidity and encourage mainstream adoption. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Legal Developments in Ripple vs. SEC Case: The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC influences the asset’s market performance. However, recent developments suggest a potential resolution may be near. Observers speculate that a settlement could become more likely with the upcoming change in U.S. administration, particularly as SEC Chair Gary Gensler is expected to step down following the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. A favorable settlement or resolution would likely remove regulatory uncertainty surrounding the asset, reinforcing its classification as a non-security. Such clarity could pave the way for increased investor confidence and institutional engagement, providing a strong foundation for price recovery. While the asset has faced significant market challenges, these three developments—Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch, the growing interest in XRP ETFs, and potential progress in its legal battle with the SEC—offer a path toward recovery and growth. As the market anticipates these events, the coming months could be key for XRP’s trajectory, making it a focal point for investors and analysts.

A new developer report by Electric Capital revealed that Solana has attracted more new developers than Ethereum for the first year since 2016. This is because, in July, Solana onboarded more developers than Ethereum. The report, released Thursday, found that 7,625 out of 39,148 new developers in 2024 used Solana as their first blockchain. Meanwhile, 6,456 have explored Ethereum this year. Solana’s low fees and fast transactions have attracted investment and talent. Ethereum has been the dominant Layer-1 network for blockchain applications. However, Solana’s increasing blockchain activity and SOL’s rapid price surge convinced more developers that a change in leadership is due. Further, 1 in 3 crypto developers work on multi-chains and have increased from less than 10% in 2015 to 34% in 2024. Among them, Base was the most popular chain, the report added. Ethereum Still Dominates Among Total Developers Despite Solana’s notable increase this year among new developers, Ethereum has shown to be the biggest ecosystem for total developer activity. Ethereum blockchain has dominated in the top 5 countries including the US, the UK, Canada and China. However, in India, which ranked number 2 by developer share this year, Solana was the preferred chain, followed by Ethereum. “Ethereum dominates by overall developers everywhere, in every continent of the world,” Shen added. “Ethereum has very, very deep network effects, and you can see that through the data.” Additionally, the data also revealed that India has onboarded the most new crypto developers since 2023, moving past the US.

The project purchased another $1 million worth of LINK late Thursday, data shows, for the second straight day, increasing its LINK stash to $2 million worth of tokens. It additionally brought $246,000 worth of Aave’s AAVE, taking total token holdings to $1.2 million.  LINK is now World Liberty Financial’s fourth-largest holding after ether (ETH), bitcoin (BTC) and tether (USDT).  Backed by the Trump family, World Liberty Financial is a unified platform where users can borrow and lend cryptocurrencies, create liquidity pools and transact with stablecoins. WLFI serves as a governance token for the platform.  It uses data provider Chainlink's services for better integrating with the wider crypto ecosystem. Chainlink supports the platform by providing crucial pricing data and cross-chain interoperability infrastructure, per a November report.  Chainlink bridges blockchains and off-chain systems, providing smart contracts with access to real-world data, external APIs, and other off-chain resources. LINK tokens, among other are used to pay node operators for their services in retrieving and preparing off-chain data or performing computations.  Part of investor demand for LINK tokens is directly tied to the utility and adoption of Chainlink's oracle services.  And the market is positively reacting to the Trump-linked purchases — LINK prices are up 22% in the past 7 days and more than 130% since World Liberty Financial first onboarded Chainlink, helping the token reach price levels last seen in early 2021.  LINK neared $30 in Asian morning hours Friday, data shows, with open interest (OI) on the token’s futures zooming to record highs above $860 million.  OI refers to the number of unsettled bets in futures markets. A bump in prices alongside rising OI is generally considered a bullish sign, as it suggests investors are willing to commit new capital to the expectation that the price will continue to rise.",POSITIVE,BTC | LINK,BTC | BUSINESS | LINK | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2024/12/13/link-surges-to-2021-levels-as-trump-s-world-liberty-buys-more-chainlink-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e14e8aa5f44c4d90d1f39a9f79e6c76cbf3678a9-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Elon’s Gold (ELONGOLD), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELONGOLD is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon’s Gold can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon’s Gold could become the next viral memecoin. Elon’s Gold launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon’s Gold on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon’s Gold by entering its contract address – 81F7f7AKQ3UZr78JQNcegX8UFLzeFXBWoAyDXs2H5Xuv – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELONGOLD.

This Ethereum-based token continues to thrive, thanks to its vibrant community and innovative ecosystem developments. Meanwhile, Non-Playable Coin (NPC) is shaking up the meme coin scene with its unique hybrid design, blending ERC20 tokens with NFTs in a concept called Meme Fungible Tokens (MFTs). Meme coins have transformed from quirky projects into serious contenders, redefining what’s possible in the crypto world. At the forefront of this evolution is BTFD Coin , a fresh face with a $3.6 million presale achievement, 90% APY staking rewards, and a bullish community rallying behind its success. With only a few presale stages left, BTFD Coin is leading the charge as the best crypto presale to buy now. Let’s explore how these three projects—BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and NPC—are shaping the future of meme coins and why they’re catching the eye of investors worldwide. BTFD Coin: The Best Crypto Presale to Buy Now Are you ready to ride the bull run? BTFD Coin might just be your golden ticket. With its presale currently in Stage 11, BTFD has already raised over $3.6 million, selling more than 52 billion coins, and is now priced at $0.00012 per token. But the excitement doesn’t stop there—this meme coin is packed with features designed to capture the market’s attention and redefine meme coin investments. BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game beta version is live, offering a sneak peek into a unique gaming experience that combines fun and crypto rewards. While no earnings are available during the beta phase, the game’s potential is creating buzz among investors and gamers alike. Add to this a staggering 90% APY staking reward, and it’s clear why BTFD is leading as the best crypto presale to buy now . Imagine this: an investment of $2,000 at the current price of $0.00012 gets you 16,666,667 BTFD coins. When the presale price hits $0.0006, your investment will soar to $10,000, delivering a 400% return. That’s the kind of growth potential that’s hard to ignore. With just a few presale stages left, the opportunity to “ own the dip ” won’t last long. BTFD Coin’s presale is a testament to its strong community and forward-thinking approach, making it a must-have for meme coin enthusiasts and savvy investors alike. Shiba Inu: Aiming for a 180% Upswing Shiba Inu, often hailed as the “Dogecoin killer,” continues to dominate headlines with its ambitious growth projections. Trading at $0.00002933 and up by 8.8% in the past 24 hours, SHIB is on an upward trajectory. Analysts like Javon Marks predict that the token could reach $0.000081, representing an astounding 180% climb. Since its launch in 2020, Shiba Inu has grown from a playful meme coin to a globally recognised cryptocurrency. Its decentralised, community-driven approach has attracted millions of holders and boosted adoption in real-world payments. The ShibaSwap ecosystem further enhances its utility, offering features like staking and token swaps. SHIB’s strong community and bullish predictions make it a compelling choice for investors. As it rides this wave of momentum, Shiba Inu’s potential for exponential growth is undeniable. Non-Playable Coin (NPC): Memes Meet NFTs Non-Playable Coin (NPC) is more than just a meme coin—it’s a bold experiment in hybrid crypto design. Inspired by the non-playable character meme, NPC allows users to convert its tokens into NFTs at a 1:1 ratio, creating a seamless bridge between two traditionally separate markets. This innovative concept, called Meme Fungible Tokens (MFTs), is revolutionising how people interact with meme culture in crypto. Trading at $0.03647, NPC has gained 15.71% over the past month, reflecting growing investor interest. By tying its supply to the global human population as of July 2023, NPC adds a quirky yet meaningful narrative to its tokenomics. Its dual liquidity on decentralised exchanges and NFT marketplaces makes it a unique asset for collectors and traders alike. For those seeking a blend of creativity, culture, and functionality, NPC is a standout contender. Its growing adoption and innovative structure make it a key player in the evolving crypto landscape. The Bottom Line Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Shiba Inu, and NPC are redefining what it means to invest in meme coins. Shiba Inu’s impressive predictions and global adoption showcase its staying power, while NPC’s hybrid innovation offers a fresh take on meme culture. But the star of the show is BTFD Coin, leading the market with its explosive presale performance, innovative features, and massive growth potential. If you’re ready to secure your spot in the next big meme coin revolution, join the BTFD Coin presale now . The bulls are running, and this is your chance to be part of the action.

Arkansas Representative French Hill, who is a well known pro-crypto advocate, was chosen to lead the House Financial Services Committee. Meanwhile, billionaire Mark Cuban linked the Biden administration’s stance on crypto and its supporters to Kamala Harris’ election loss, Texas is also jumping onto the Bitcoin reserve waggon, and proposed a Bitcoin reserve bill funded by voluntary donations. Brian Quintenz in Line for Top CFTC Position Brian Quintenz, a former commissioner of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), is reportedly the leading candidate for the agency’s chairmanship under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. According to a Bloomberg report , Quintenz has already been interviewed for the position. Quitenz currently serves as the head of policy at Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto division, a16z, and his background includes major contributions to financial innovation and regulatory frameworks during his tenure at the CFTC between 2017 and 2021. Many people believe his appointment could be pivotal in addressing the long-standing jurisdictional ambiguity over cryptocurrencies between the CFTC and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Quintenz’s record at the CFTC is riddled with consistent advocacy for integrating digital asset derivatives and event contracts into the agency’s regulatory framework. At a16z, he also still pushed for balanced crypto regulations that promote growth while addressing compliance challenges. By leveraging his experience in both traditional finance and crypto policy, Quintenz plans to bridge the regulatory divide between these sectors. He has also been a very outspoken critic of the SEC , particularly with regards to its treatment of Ethereum (ETH). In March, he questioned the SEC’s stance, and pointed out that the approval of Ether futures ETFs was implicit recognition of Ether as a non-security asset. He also argued that if the SEC truly viewed ETH as a security, the approved futures contracts would be deemed illegal. Recent developments validated his position even more, especially as spot Ether ETFs are thriving and recording impressive inflows. These ETFs even registered a record $431.5 million in a single day on Dec. 5. Quintenz’s expertise when it comes to navigating these complex regulatory issues is expected to be instrumental as the crypto industry anticipates major policy shifts under the Trump administration. A16z, is a major player in the crypto space, and has invested in many well known projects in the industry, including Maker, Solana, Avalanche, Aptos, and OpenSea, among others. The firm believes the new administration could provide greater regulatory flexibility that will encourage innovation and experimentation in the crypto sector. Quintenz’s potential leadership at the CFTC could be one step forward towards this goal. French Hill to Lead House Financial Services Committee Arkansas Representative French Hill, who is a known advocate for crypto and blockchain policy, is set to lead the United States House Financial Services Committee in the upcoming Congress. Hill is currently the chair of a digital asset subcommittee, and was selected to take over from Patrick McHenry, who is stepping down after two decades in office. Hill is very grateful for the trust that was placed in him by his colleagues, and stated that he looks forward to collaborating with President Trump and Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott to implement economic policies that will boost American prosperity. The House Financial Services Committee plays a critical role in shaping policy for the financial services industry and oversees major regulators like the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and the Treasury. On the bright side, Hill's leadership means that the pro-crypto momentum within the committee is continuing. In July, Hill shared his optimism about advancing key legislation, including a crypto regulation bill and a stablecoin bill, before the end of the year. Now, with Hill positioned in an influential role, these measures could gain some renewed traction in 2025. Hill's leadership appointment happened after his victory over fellow Republican contenders Andy Barr, Frank Lucas, and Bill Huizenga in the party’s steering committee decision. His selection must still be ratified by a full conference vote. Mark Cuban Ties Crypto to Harris Election Loss Politicians are not the only ones looking to advocate for crypto. In a recent episode of The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart, billionaire Mark Cuban discussed the role of crypto in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, his support for Vice President Kamala Harris, and the future of digital assets. The Weekly Show Cuban revealed that he strongly urged the Harris campaign to appeal to young men, due to their connection to crypto communities. He warned Harris and SEC Chair Gary Gensler that the administration's crypto policies could have cost her the election as many young men voted against her, partly due to their dissatisfaction with the administration’s stance on digital assets. Cuban is known to be a vocal advocate for crypto, and offered himself as a potential replacement for Gensler if Harris won. However, after Donald Trump’s victory, the focus shifted. Trump ended up announcing plans to nominate former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins to lead the regulatory agency in 2025. During the podcast, Stewart described himself as having limited knowledge of blockchain, and engaged Cuban in a discussion comparing cryptocurrency investments to gambling. Cuban explained the fundamentals of Bitcoin, and compared it to digital gold. He also outlined some of its advantages as a store of value, its capped supply, and its efficiency in remitting funds. Additionally, they delved into the SEC’s regulatory approach under Gensler, which classified many tokens as securities. Stewart humorously acknowledged his lack of understanding, and referred to the conversation as “Digital Currency for Dummies.” Stewart also had a 2022 discussion with Cuban on cryptocurrencies and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). That conversation took place before a major market downturn that impacted crypto firms like FTX and Celsius. Texas Also Eyes Bitcoin Reserve A new legislative proposal in Texas aims to establish a Bitcoin reserve as part of the state treasury. The draft bill was tentatively named the ”Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act,” and was introduced on Dec. 12 by Representative Giovanni Capriglione. The legislation proposes that Bitcoin be held as a reserve asset by the state comptroller for a minimum of five years. Unlike other proposals for national Bitcoin reserves, the Texas bill does not include provisions for using crypto assets seized by authorities, but focuses instead on voluntary donations from residents, companies, and other state resources. The Texas Blockchain Council clarified that no taxpayer funds will be used to buy Bitcoin. This measure was likely included to increase the bill’s chances of passing. Donations from Texans and U.S.-based companies are expected to fund the reserve. To become law, the bill needs a two-thirds majority vote in both the Texas Senate and House. The state legislature is scheduled to reconvene on Jan. 14 for its 89th regular session. This proposal is very similar to efforts in other states. In Pennsylvania, a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill for a Bitcoin reserve modeled after a framework developed by the advocacy group Satoshi Action Fund. The group’s co-founder, Dennis Porter , confirmed that Texas drew inspiration from the same framework. These initiatives come in the wake of the 2024 U.S. elections, which saw Republicans gaining control of the presidency and Congress. During his campaign, President Donald Trump pledged to explore the creation of a strategic national Bitcoin stockpile.",POSITIVE,ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | ETH | FIAT | REGULATION,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6527/a16z-s-brian-quintenz-trump-s-top-contender-for-cftc-chair,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png

Despite recording a drop of ~1% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $68.260 billion, the price of Bitcoin has continued hovering around its milestone price of $100,000. However, the dominance of this crypto token has now decreased to 54.98%. TradingView: BTC/USDT Since November, the Simple Moving Average (SMA) has constantly supported the Bitcoin price chart, highlighting a long-term bullish price sentiment for the largest cryptocurrency in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recorded increased price volatility, with its average trendline recording a constant downtrend. This suggests a mixed price action for the BTC price this week. Bitcoin ETF Update Over the past 24 hours, BlackRock’s “IBIT” recorded the highest inflow of $431.6 million, followed by Grayscale’s “BTC” with $110.8 million.

Moreover, the largest cryptocurrency ETF has maintained in positive flow for the 11th consecutive day for the first time in months. Will BTC Price Hit $110,000 Next? Maintaining its value above the $100k mark could set the stage for Bitcoin’s retest of its $102,000 mark. Furthermore, if the bullish sentiment intensifies, the BTC price could head toward its ATH. Conversely, a bearish price action could pull the price toward the $98,000 level. Moreover, if the bulls fail to regain momentum at that point, this could pull the BTC price toward its $95,000 range.

Bitcoin ETFs led the inflows, with US spot ETFs bringing in $597.5m, data from SoSoValue showed. Grayscale’s GBTC, Bitwise’s BITB and Fidelity’s FBTC dominated, reflecting high investor confidence even as Bitcoin faced price challenges.

However, optimism in the US stock market this week drove Bitcoin back near the $100K mark, subsequently attracting investors. Consequently, the Cryptocurrency Sentiment Index re-entered extreme greed territory, last standing at 76. “Current [BTC] levels are above the psychologically important round level and the consolidation area of the last three weeks,” Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro. “It may be risky to talk about a breakout to new highs and a complete eradication of bearish sentiment. A confirmation of buying strength could see a quick rally into the $120,000 area.” Ether last fell 0.5%, trading at $3,916, but is up nearly 10% in the last week. Kuptsikevich noted that it will be interesting to observe how the price behaves as it approaches the $4,100 mark. At this point, there’s an approximate even chance of either a significant downward reversal or a breakthrough past the resistance, potentially heading towards $5,000, he said. Bitcoin Dominates at 53% Market Share as Ether Nears $4,100 Resistance James Toledano, chief operating officer at Unity Wallet, said ETH’s chart does suggest bullish momentum, with structural signals and minimal resistance toward its all-time high. “There is also significant ETF-related optimism, technical breakouts, and strong market sentiment that bolster its potential,” he said. “But investors should remain cautious, as significant gains of any cryptocurrency are often met with profit-taking —which appears to be happening as we speak. For some, ETH might indeed deliver a festive surprise, but for others it could be an unwelcome one.” “Bitcoin is still the dominant player, it represents over 53% of crypto’s entire market cap,” Toledano added. “So generally speaking, when the mercury on BTC rises, many others follow and ETH is the second biggest player in town. While both assets are fundamentally different they often move in tandem due to shared market dynamics, such as liquidity inflows from institutional investors and macroeconomic drivers like decreasing inflationary pressures.” The post Bitcoin and Ether ETFs Combined See $870M Daily Inflows Amid Investor Confidence appeared first on Cryptonews .",POSITIVE,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-ether-etfs-attract-870m-daily-inflows/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37579493.jpeg
37579492,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319198,1734070142,Bitcoin Price Near $100K: Kraken Faces $5.1M Fine and Texas Pushes Bitcoin Reserve Bill,"Bitcoin price highlights its current value at $99,960, reflecting a 0.25% dip amid developments influencing regulatory and institutional trends. Kraken’s $5.1 million fine for margin trading violations and Texas’s strategic Bitcoin reserve proposal underscore the shifting dynamics in crypto governance. Meanwhile, BlackRock’s endorsement of a 2% Bitcoin allocation signals growing institutional interest, reinforcing the importance of understanding Bitcoin’s evolving role in global markets. Kraken Fined $5.1 Million for Regulatory Breach; Pressures Bitcoin Price Bitcoin price traded at $99,960 on Friday, down 0.25%, amid broader discussions of regulatory compliance. In a landmark decision, the Australian Federal Court fined Bit Trade, Kraken ‘s local operator, A$8 million ($5.1 million) for providing margin trading loans to over 1,100 clients without ensuring product suitability. KRAKEN'S AUSTRALIAN EXCHANGE OPERATOR FINED $5.1M FOR UNLAWFUL ISSUANCE OF CREDIT FACILITY TO CUSTOMERS – The Federal Court of Australia has charged Bit Trade, the country's operating firm of Kraken Exchange, $5.1M for violating regulatory obligations. – The fine comes after… https://t.co/ejbL1x6YJ8 pic.twitter.com/hDGhmzZxsh — BSCN (@BSCNews) December 12, 2024 The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) reported that Kraken earned $7 million in fees and interest while clients lost over $5 million. This marks the first time an Australian company has been penalized for failing to adhere to credit product guidelines. Kraken expressed disappointment, warning the ruling could hinder economic growth, though the company pledged to cooperate with regulators. Analysts note this could lead to stricter global crypto laws, potentially limiting trades in the short term but boosting long-term investor confidence through regulatory clarity. Texas Proposes Strategic Bitcoin Reserve In a bold move to embrace Bitcoin, the Texas House introduced a bill to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Proposed by Republican Representative Giovanni Capriglione, the reserve would allow Texas to accept Bitcoin donations, fees, and taxes. The plan, which aims to enhance economic stability and foster Bitcoin innovation, would hold cryptocurrency for a minimum of five years but does not currently permit direct Bitcoin purchases. Texas, the second-largest U.S. economy, continues to position itself as a hub for Bitcoin mining and adoption. Legislation was introduced in the Texas House Thursday to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve, which could serve as a proving ground for the U.S. Treasury https://t.co/ptqQei1CjQ #texasnews — NBC DFW (@NBCDFW) December 12, 2024 Market optimism has grown as other states and countries contemplate similar legislation. President-elect Trump’s pro-cybersecurity stance has further fueled interest, potentially encouraging broader institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Key insights into the Texas Bitcoin bill: Bitcoin can be accepted as donations or tax payments. The reserve is intended to boost Texas’s economic resilience. Cryptocurrency holdings will be retained for at least five years. BlackRock Suggests 2% Bitcoin Allocation BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, advised investors to allocate up to 2% of their portfolios to Bitcoin, citing its diversification potential and unique return profile. The firm highlighted Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets while acknowledging risks such as volatility and slow adoption. To contextualize Bitcoin’s risk, BlackRock compared its profile to leading tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia. However, it cautioned that allocations exceeding 2% could diminish Bitcoin’s benefits due to increased risk exposure. BlackRock suggests allocating 2% of your portfolio to Bitcoin. Chat, maybe memecoins are the better choice? pic.twitter.com/prThdAayAB — 5 Minute Daily (@5mDaily) December 12, 2024 BlackRock’s support underscores Bitcoin’s growing acceptance as a mainstream investment. This could bolster institutional interest and sustain upward pressure on Bitcoin prices in the near to medium term. Bitcoin Price Outlook: December 13, 2024 Bitcoin ‘s price hovers near $99,960, consolidating after a breakout from a symmetrical triangle pattern. This pattern is now providing solid support around the $99,350 pivot point, maintaining bullish momentum. Immediate resistance is seen at $101,930, followed by $103,660 and $105,200, signaling potential upside if Bitcoin sustains its breakout. On the downside, immediate support is positioned at $97,800, with additional safety nets at $95,950 and $94,280. The 50 EMA at $99,370 underscores the trend, acting as dynamic support. The RSI at 55 suggests bullish sentiment, with room for upward movement before entering overbought territory. Traders should watch for a clear break above $101,930 for confirmation of an extended rally. However, a fall below $99,350 could invalidate bullish prospects, prompting a retest of lower support zones. Key Insights: Resistance Levels: $101,930, $103,660, and $105,200. Support Levels: $99,350, $97,800, and $95,950. Breakout Confirmation: Symmetrical triangle breakout supports bullish continuation above $99,350. – You might also like Bitcoin Price Prediction 2024 – 2034 The post Bitcoin Price Near $100K: Kraken Faces $5.1M Fine and Texas Pushes Bitcoin Reserve Bill appeared first on Cryptonews .",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | FIAT | REGULATION | TRADING,,0,0,cryptonews,https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-near-100k-kraken-faces-5-1m-fine-and-texas-pushes-bitcoin-reserve-bill/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/37579492.jpeg

The report highlights a significant shift in the developer landscape, with Solana projected to attract 7,625 new developers by 2024, an 83% increase from the previous year. Of the 39,148 developers who started exploring the crypto space this year, around 20% chose Solana as their platform. This is the first time another blockchain has surpassed Ethereum in growth since its launch in 2016, according to Electric Capital’s findings. Despite Solana’s rapid growth, Ethereum remains the dominant blockchain by total number of developers across all major regions, including North and South America, Asia, Europe, and Africa. Solana follows closely behind as the second largest ecosystem for developers globally. Related News: Big Bear Analyst il Capo also Stepped Back: Shares His Next Move The report attributes Solana’s developer growth to a variety of factors, including increased network activity and user interest during the recent memecoin rally. Platforms like Pumpfun, which simplify memecoin launches, have played a key role in increasing engagement. “Solana’s growth demonstrates the ecosystem’s ability to attract developers by offering high scalability and an active user base,” the report said. Electric Capital’s analysis also revealed significant growth in other blockchain ecosystems, with Aptos, Base, Bitcoin, Internet Computer, NEAR, Polkadot, Polygon, Starknet, and Sui each adding over 1,000 new developers in 2024. Meanwhile, networks like BNB, Optimism, Scroll, Stellar, and TON added 500 developers each. *This is not investment advice.

The SNB cut rates by 50bps, the ECB by 25bps, the BoC by 50bps, and the BoJ hinted at holding off on further hikes. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell -1.06% to around 39,530 while the broader Topix Index lost 0.8% to 2,750 on Friday, paring gains from the previous session. The Japanese yen weakened to around 153 per dollar on Friday, its lowest level in more than two weeks, amid growing speculation that the Bank of Japan may hold off on an interest rate hike at next week’s meeting. Japan's industrial production increased by 2.8% month-over-month in October 2024, below the preliminary estimate of 3.0% growth. The Bank of Japan's index for big manufacturers' sentiment edged higher to 14 in Q4 of 2024 from 13 in the prior two periods, marking the highest print since Q1 of 2022 and defying market consensus of 12. China ( SHCOMP ) fell -1.46% to around 3,425 and the Shenzhen Component losing 1.5% to 10,790, ending a three-day rally as China's annual Central Economic Work Conference concluded. At the conference, officials led by Xi Jinping pledged to adopt a more expansive fiscal and monetary approach, including a larger budget deficit, increased borrowing, and reduced interest rates. Caution mounted ahead of a slew of economic data from China due Monday, including retail sales and industrial output. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell -1.71% to 20,077 in early deals on Friday, surrendering gains from the prior session due to steep losses across sectors. Locally, industrial output in Hong Kong fell in Q3, after rising in the previous six quarters.

37574091,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392570,1734069558,SEC’s Bullying of Elon Musk and Ripple Exposed: Pro-XRP Lawyer Pins Hopes on Atkins,"The post SEC’s Bullying of Elon Musk and Ripple Exposed: Pro-XRP Lawyer Pins Hopes on Atkins appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News John E. Deaton has slammed the SEC for its aggressive actions against companies and individuals, using Elon Musk’s recent legal clash as an example. Deaton highlighted a report that SEC Chair Gary Gensler had issued a settlement demand to Musk, threatening charges unless he complied within 48 hours. Musk’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, accused the SEC of harassment and politically motivated actions. Elon Musk has had a long-running feud with the SEC, starting in 2018 when the agency charged him with fraud over his “Funding secured” in his X post about taking Tesla private. Musk settled the case, paying $20 million fines for both himself and Tesla, and stepping down as Tesla’s chairman. However, the settlement only fueled his resentment towards the SEC. Musk has repeatedly criticized SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and, since Trump’s election, has continued his public attacks. Musk is now leading a nongovernmental effort, the “ Department of Government Efficiency ” (DOGE), to study federal spending and regulation. John Deaton Took a Jab at SEC’s Actions Having said that, Deaton argued that if the SEC treats the world’s richest man this way, smaller businesses and entrepreneurs face even harsher challenges. He referenced the LBRY case, where the SEC allegedly threatened to bankrupt the company and its founder, Jeremy Kauffman, even before filing a lawsuit. Similarly, Ripple and its CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly spent over $150 million defending against what Deaton described as a “non-fraud” case. Most companies lack such resources, making fighting back against the SEC nearly impossible. Deaton also pointed to the SEC’s actions against Dragonchain as another example of regulatory overreach. He expressed hope that Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner , could reform the agency if given the chance. Community Reaction An X user Nuclear Herbs res ponded to John Deaton and shared another example of SEC overreach in the SEC v Richard Heart Hearing where the judge struggled to understand the SEC’s fraud allegations. The post suggests that just because the SEC accuses someone of fraud, it doesn’t mean there’s any real fraud. The SEC, according to the post, is using the term “fraud” to unfairly sway public opinion, even when the claims are baseless. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Crypto vs. Banks: Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC , This critique adds to growing concerns about the SEC’s enforcement methods, particularly in the crypto space, where companies often face costly and prolonged legal battles. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The company recently minted over 13 million RLUSD tokens across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum Network, marking a key phase in its mainnet testing. Ripple Minted 13 Mln RLUSD Token In recent tweet posts, Ripple Stablecoin Tracker highlighted that the company minted 2.6 million RLUSD tokens on the XRP Ledger, along with additional smaller batches of 100,000, 160,000, and 640,000 RLUSD. Notably, the XRP Ledger showcased its low-cost efficiency, with minting expenses totaling just 0.00048 XRP . On the Ethereum Network, Ripple minted 10.4 million and 640,000 RLUSD tokens, with the cost for the largest batch being 0.00161 ETH, or about $6.31. However, these tests showcase the scalability and cost-effectiveness of both networks. Preparing for a Stablecoin Launch Ripple has been carefully testing RLUSD through minting , burning, and transferring processes to ensure it can handle real-world demands upon full launch. With its entry into the competitive stablecoin arena, RLUSD will face strong contenders like Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC. However, Ripple’s regulatory compliance may give it an edge, positioning RLUSD as a reliable asset for financial institutions. Meanwhile, CEO Brad Garlinghouse assured community users, “When RLUSD is live, you’ll hear it from Ripple first.” XRP Price Update The launch announcement had a bullish impact on XRP, Ripple’s native token. XRP surged by 13%, reaching $2.46 , with potential targets of $2.80 and even $3 if it breaks the $2.50 resistance level. Analysts are closely monitoring the token as it approaches the key resistance level within a descending channel, with the next 48 hours being pivotal for market movements.",POSITIVE,ETH | USDT | XRP,ETH | TRADING | USDT | WALLET | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/ripple-minted-13-million-rlusd-stablecoin-across-xrp-eth-network/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

37573144,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661788,1734067823,"XRP Bull Flag Breakout Could Lead Price To $4, Analyst Says","An analyst has explained how XRP could end up traveling to the $4 level if its 4-hour price can break out of a recent bull flag pattern. XRP Has Been Consolidating Inside A Bull Flag Recently In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about how the 4-hour price of XRP has been forming a Bull Flag recently. The “Bull Flag” here refers to a pattern in technical analysis (TA) that, as its name suggests, looks like a flag on a pole. The pattern forms whenever the asset’s price follows up a sharp uptrend with a period of consolidation towards the downside. The initial upwards move corresponds to the ‘pole,’ while the consolidation period makes up for the ‘flag.’ Related Reading: Dogecoin, XRP Flashing ‘Overlooked’ Bullish Signal, Santiment Reveals In flag patterns, this consolidation specifically happens inside a parallel channel. That is, between two parallel trendlines marking successive tops and bottoms in the price. When the trendlines are converging, the pattern is known as a pennant. The upper level of the flag can be likely to provide resistance to the price, while the lower level may act as support. A break out of either of these trendlines can imply a continuation of trend in that direction. A bull flag is considered to be a continuation pattern, so the probability of a breakout happening above the resistance level may be higher than that of the support line failing. Like the bull flag, there is also a pattern called the bear flag. This one works much in the same way, except for the fact that the pole is made by a sharp move down and the flag represents a brief phase of consolidation towards the upside. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the bull flag that XRP has recently been traveling inside: As displayed in the above graph, the 4-hour XRP price has just seen a rise to the upper level of the bull flag consolidation channel. When the same retest occurred a couple of days ago, the asset found rejection, but it’s possible that this might be the time it finds a break. Martinez has pointed out, however, that the cryptocurrency has witnessed another signal alongside this retest: the completion of a Tom Demark (TD) Sequential sell setup. The TD Sequential is a TA indicator that basically points out probable locations of tops and bottoms in any asset’s value. It involves two phases, with the first, which is known as the setup, occurring after price observes nine candles of the same color. Related Reading: Crypto Suffers $1.6 Billion Liquidations As XRP, DOGE Down 10% XRP has finished this type of TD Sequential phase with nine green candles, meaning that the indicator is now signaling a potential reversal to the downside for the coin. As such, the analyst thinks a brief correction would happen for the cryptocurrency first, before it manages to find a break above the $0.246 resistance. Bull flag breakouts can be of a similar length as the pole, so based on this, Martinez has chosen the $4 target for XRP. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.42, up more than 4% over the last seven days.

37573170,https://coinpaper.com/6528/grayscale-adds-lido-and-optimism-trusts-to-its-crypto-investment-portfolio,1734067812,Grayscale Adds Lido and Optimism Trusts to Its Crypto Investment Portfolio,"Grayscale Investments and Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market are advancing the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional finance with significant new offerings. Grayscale has launched investment trusts for Lido DAO and Optimism governance tokens, providing exposure to key Ethereum-based protocols. Meanwhile, Spotlight Stock Market has expanded its cryptocurrency exchange-traded product (ETP) lineup, adding 20 new listings from Valour, a DeFi Technologies subsidiary, broadening access to a diverse range of digital assets for investors. Grayscale Expands Investment Offerings with Lido and Optimism Governance Token Trusts Grayscale Investments, the world’s largest crypto asset manager, has unveiled two new investment trusts focused on governance tokens for Lido DAO (LDO) and Optimism (OP). The announcement, made on Dec. 12, signals a continued push by Grayscale to broaden its portfolio of crypto-focused investment products while supporting Ethereum’s scaling and staking ecosystem. The newly launched Grayscale Lido DAO Trust and Grayscale Optimism Trust are designed to give investors direct exposure to the native tokens of two influential Ethereum protocols. Lido DAO is the largest liquid staking token (LST) protocol on Ethereum, while Optimism is a prominent layer-2 (L2) scaling solution aimed at improving Ethereum’s efficiency and scalability. “Lido is helping to democratize staking on Ethereum, and Optimism is critical in allowing Ethereum to scale to compete with newer, faster layer-1 blockchains,” said Rayhaneh Sharif-Askary, Grayscale’s head of product and research. These trusts are positioned to appeal to investors seeking exposure to protocols driving Ethereum’s broader adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The goal is to offer “exposure to protocols helping to increase Ethereum’s efficiency, security, scalability, and adoption,” Sharif-Askary added. Why Lido and Optimism? Lido’s liquid staking technology has revolutionized staking on Ethereum. The protocol allows users to stake their Ethereum (ETH) while still maintaining liquidity by issuing tradeable tokens representing claims on their staked assets. This innovation has made staking more accessible and flexible for a broader range of users. As of December, Lido boasts nearly $40 billion in total value locked (TVL), securing its position as the largest DeFi protocol by TVL, according to DefiLlama . The protocol’s influence has made its governance token, LDO, a highly sought-after asset in the crypto market. Meanwhile, Optimism , a popular Ethereum layer-2 network, leverages optimistic rollups to improve transaction speed and reduce costs, addressing Ethereum’s scalability challenges. With approximately $800 million in TVL, Optimism has become a cornerstone of Ethereum’s scaling strategy. Beyond its own network, Optimism’s technology underpins other layer-2 solutions, including Coinbase’s Base and Uniswap’s Unichain, forming what the project describes as a “superchain.” This interconnected network enhances Ethereum’s scalability and facilitates a seamless user experience across various layer-2 ecosystems. The launch of the Lido and Optimism trusts is the latest in a series of initiatives by Grayscale to expand its suite of single-asset crypto investment products. Aave Governance Token Fund: In October, Grayscale introduced a trust dedicated to Aave (AAVE), a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Additional Assets Under Consideration: Grayscale has added 35 altcoins, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Worldcoin (WLD), and Pyth (PYTH), to its list of assets under consideration for future investment products. Other Recent Trusts: In August, Grayscale launched three separate trusts targeting Sky (formerly MakerDAO), Bittensor, and Sui, further diversifying its offerings. Grayscale’s Dominance in the Crypto Investment Space Grayscale manages nearly $35 billion in assets as of Dec. 11, cementing its reputation as a dominant force in the crypto investment industry. Its flagship products include the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE), both of which are industry benchmarks for institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. US regulators are also evaluating Grayscale’s proposal to convert its Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC)—a fund holding a mix of cryptocurrencies—into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, this move could further solidify Grayscale’s role as a leader in crypto financial products. Grayscale’s new trusts bring attention to the growing importance of Ethereum-based protocols in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. By focusing on Lido and Optimism, Grayscale is betting on Ethereum’s ability to address its scalability and usability challenges, which are crucial for its long-term adoption and success. The investments also highlight the rising demand for products that offer exposure to governance tokens—critical assets that give holders a say in the development and direction of blockchain protocols. As Ethereum continues to innovate and expand its ecosystem, the success of projects like Lido and Optimism could pave the way for further institutional interest in DeFi and layer-2 solutions. Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market Expands Crypto ETP Offerings with 20 New Listings by Valour The Spotlight Stock Market in Sweden has significantly bolstered its cryptocurrency-focused investment offerings by listing 20 new digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs). All the newly introduced ETPs were issued by Valour, a subsidiary of DeFi Technologies, marking another major milestone in bringing blockchain technology to traditional investors. With the new listings, Spotlight now hosts 45 ETPs, all of which are issued by Valour. These ETPs provide investors with regulated access to a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and blockchain projects without needing to manage the complexities of holding digital assets directly. Of the 45 products, four are denominated in euros, while the remainder are priced in Swedish kronor. Valour’s expansion on Spotlight began in June with the launch of ETPs for Core (CORE) and Hedera (HBAR). The company’s latest offering includes a mix of well-established and emerging blockchain projects, reflecting Valour’s goal of broadening access to the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency ecosystem. Johan Wattenström, co-founder of Valour, emphasized the significance of the new launches, stating, “By simultaneously introducing such a diverse range of innovative products, we are not merely expanding our portfolio — we are offering investors access to the forefront of blockchain technology.” The Assets Behind the New ETPs The 20 new ETPs feature an eclectic mix of cryptocurrencies and blockchain protocols , including: Aave (AAVE): A leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Aerodrome Finance (AERO): A platform focused on liquidity and DeFi innovation. Akash Network (AKT): A decentralized cloud computing marketplace. Aptos (APT): A next-generation layer-1 blockchain. Arweave (AR): A blockchain solution for permanent data storage. Fetch.ai (FET): An AI-driven blockchain platform. Fantom (FTM): A scalable blockchain for DeFi and enterprise applications. Injective (INJ): A layer-1 blockchain optimized for decentralized finance. Jupiter (JUP): A platform for decentralized applications and token utilities. Kaspa (KAS): A layer-1 blockchain with a focus on speed and security. Lido DAO (LDO): A liquid staking protocol for Ethereum. Metis (METIS): A layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum. Pendle (PENDLE): A protocol for trading tokenized yield. Pyth Network (PYTH): A decentralized oracle solution. Render (RNDR): A blockchain for decentralized GPU rendering. Sei (SEI): A layer-1 blockchain optimized for trading. Starknet (STRK): A layer-2 scaling solution using zero-knowledge proofs. THORChain (RUNE): A decentralized liquidity network. Worldcoin (WLD): A cryptocurrency with a focus on universal access and identity. Wormhole (W): A cross-chain interoperability protocol. Valour’s Strategic Expansion Valour’s latest listings align with its broader mission to dominate the European ETP market. The company currently manages over 60 ETPs across Europe and has set an ambitious target of reaching 100 ETPs by the end of 2025. In November, Valour and Spotlight introduced the first Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP, capturing attention for its novel approach to meme cryptocurrency investing. In October, Valour also migrated 19 ETPs from the Nordic Growth Market to Spotlight, further consolidating its presence in Sweden’s financial ecosystem. Valour’s reach is not limited to Europe. The company has taken significant steps toward global expansion. In November, it signed a memorandum of understanding with AsiaNext, a Singapore-licensed securities exchange, to list its ETPs for institutional investors in Asia. AsiaNext is a joint venture between Japan’s SBI Digital Asset Holdings and Switzerland’s SIX Group, which operates the SIX Exchange. In August, Valour partnered with Sov.fi and the Nairobi Securities Exchange in Kenya to explore listing Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Hedera (HBAR) on the exchange. This initiative marked a pioneering move toward introducing digital asset ETPs to African markets. The rapid growth of Valour’s offerings signals increasing institutional and retail interest in cryptocurrency investments. Exchange-traded products simplify access to digital assets, offering a regulated environment for investors who might otherwise be hesitant to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency ownership. Valour’s decision to expand its portfolio with Spotlight shows Sweden’s growing importance as a hub for cryptocurrency innovation. Spotlight is one of three major stock markets in the country, alongside Nasdaq Nordic and Nordic Growth Market. By positioning itself as a leader in crypto ETPs, Spotlight aims to attract a new generation of investors looking to diversify their portfolios with blockchain-based assets.",POSITIVE,ETH | LDO,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | LDO,,0,0,Coinpaper,https://coinpaper.com/6528/grayscale-adds-lido-and-optimism-trusts-to-its-crypto-investment-portfolio,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png
37573735,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52008,1734067812,This Innovative GambleFi Protocol Is Outperforming Major Altcoins With Its Disruptive Technology,"A novel GambleFi Protocol known as Rollblock is outperforming altcoins in its presale. Tipped by insiders to 60x or more in 2025 after the presale finalizes, Rollblock (RBLK) aims to break up the centralized gambling market with democratized access for users through instant crypto deposits and withdrawals, as well as staking APY, revenue sharing, and token burning. The RBLK price is steady at $0.041 in its 9th presale stage, while altcoins are dropping RBLK will increase to $0.047, taking early returns to new highs. Meanwhile, large-cap cryptos like Binance Coin (BNB) and Ripple (XRP) have both declined by 11%. Ripple Sees Huge Declines Post-Surge The Ripple real-time settlement ecosystem has seen a larger pullback than other tokens. However, the reason for the decline is clear, as it observed an impressive bullish trend in recent months. The Ripple token traded at $0.70 on November 12 and peaked at $2.72 on December 2. Presently, the coin sits at $2.02 after the expected retracement. In three weeks, the price of Ripple has nearly tripled, which was not the case for the majority of other tokens. The pullback was inevitable. Moreover, the token might see even further downside in the coming weeks and months as many investors sell to take out their profits. Binance Coin Falling Along With Wider Crypto Economy The price drop of Binance Coin is less explainable than Ripple and is likely due to a correlation with the wider crypto economy. Binance Coin traded at a low of $550 in early November and peaked at $750 in early December. Binance Coin’s upside was far less impressive than Ripples and it currently trades at around $658. Like Ripple, Binance Coin does provide strong underlying utility. Binance Coin is a huge ecosystem with a variety of products, including a CEX, DEX, wallet, NFT marketplace, P2P marketplace, and more. It provides both DeFi and CeFi operations. But this is still not enough to protect it from the wider market with Bitcoin declines often causing Binance Coin to crash. Rollblock’s GambleFi Protocol Is Crushing the Market Rollblock is an AI-powered GambleFi ecosystem with swift payouts, weekly profit sharing, instant crypto deposits, staking APY, transaction analytics, and a token burn mechanism that takes the native coin out of circulation to increase the price of remaining coins. The Rollblock crypto casino is fully licensed and verified by the Curacao Gaming Authority with an independent third-party audit from SolidProof. Of the 1,000,000,000 RBLK tokens, 60% are available in the presale with 11% allocated to exchange listings, 11% to rewards, 12% to marketing, and 6% to development. Profits are redistributed weekly to players as part of the project’s revenue share model, and other passive income mechanisms include liquidity provision, yield farming, staking, and affiliate programs, along with early bird presale pricing. Given the many passive income mechanisms, it is entirely feasible to see Rollblock 60x or more in 2025, and it targets a highly lucrative online gambling market that is set for change. With tokens currency selling at just $0.041, the RBLK presale could be the perfect option for investors frustrated at an overbought crypto market, including Ripple and Binance tokens with several price increases anticipated before the end of the year!

In a post on X, Ethena Labs, built on the Ethereum blockchain, announced a possible launch for its stablecoin USDe which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is mainly built as a yield-generating asset rather than an intermediary for a transaction, similar to Tether ( USDT ) or USD Coin ( USDC ). 16.12.2024 pic.twitter.com/zmRQyCFfy9 — Ethena Labs (@ethena_labs) December 12, 2024 Ethena Labs announcement of USDe stablecoin on X. In contrast to the traditional fiat-reserve-backed stablecoins , USDe derives its yield based on the staking rewards of Ethereum ( ETH ) and keeps that reward away from the short funding rate for ETH. By doing so, it provides the holder an attractive annual percentage yield of up to 29%. This double-layered yield model makes USDe a high-reward financial instrument in the decentralized finance space. Users have rapidly flocked to USDe, making it the third-largest USD-pegged stablecoin, overtaking DAI’s $4.7 billion market cap, but is still behind USDT and USDC, which have a market cap of $135 billion and $40 billion, respectively. According to CoinMarketCap , USDe’s trading volume increased by 24.27% in the past 24 hours to reach $171.09 million, indicating high demand for yield-bearing assets.

Ethena’s USDe has been compared to Terra-Luna, whose value also collapsed in 2022 because of its unsustainable growth model, by critics . Terra’s collapse was attributed to its struggles to maintain its peg with the U.S dollar in a bearish market, and experts fear USDe could suffer the same fate. USDe employs a delta-neutral trading strategy, which balances Bitcoin ( BTC ) and ETH long and short positions to maintain its stability and yield. Ethena hedges the long stETH positions on centralized exchanges. In case a CEX goes down, the hedge may sit there; Ethena’s positions open to unrealized profits and losses. In a bull market, since the funding rate stays positive, this technique will work well; however, in bear markets, once the funding rate becomes negative, the yield can go down.

That being said, there have been events in this industry I wish I was more curious about, there have also been events I definitely did… — Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) April 3, 2024 Andre Cronje talks about Margin/Collateral model on X. “ So while things are going great now because market is positive and shorting funding rates are positive, eventually that turns, funding becomes negative, margin/collateral gets liquidated, and you have an unbacked asset. The counter to that is “law of large numbers”, which is pretty much the same as UST’s $1bn BTC fund etc. It works until it doesn’t “. by Andre Cronje Andre Cronje, the Chief Technology Officer of Fantom Foundation, for example, has highlighted that USDe’s model may only hold in bullish market conditions, and its resilience in a bear market is unproven, drawing parallels to the collapse of Terra-Luna. Secondly, given the growing efficiency of the crypto market, the profit margins, known as the basis spread , could narrow, reducing the profitability of USDe’s high yields in the long run.

This initiative aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s vision for a federal-level Bitcoin reserve, highlighting the growing acceptance of Bitcoin across states and industries. Seems US states are already making Trump’s vision of Bitcoin reserve a reality.

Securely store and manage… pic.twitter.com/VPgyyBb1I9 — Pierre Rochard (@BitcoinPierre) December 12, 2024 A Bold Step for Texas The Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act proposes creating a state fund to hold Bitcoin, using Texas’s strong foothold in Bitcoin mining to boost financial stability and drive digital innovation. Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, supports the initiative, highlighting its reliance on voluntary Bitcoin donations from residents instead of taxpayer money, fostering a sense of community ownership. Key Features of the Proposal The bill outlines the creation of a secure Bitcoin fund, serving as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Representative Capriglione emphasized its flexibility, leaving room for future expansion based on legislative support. This approach could make Texas a pioneer in integrating Bitcoin into its financial systems. Others Following the League This proposal mirrors similar efforts nationwide, such as Pennsylvania’s recent legislation. Up to ten other states and several countries are reportedly exploring comparable measures. On the federal level, President-elect Trump’s pro-crypto stance includes plans for a national Bitcoin reserve and the formation of a crypto advisory council. Plus, states like Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Montana have already enacted laws to support mining rights and digital asset innovation. Advocacy groups, such as the Satoshi Action Fund, have introduced over 30 crypto-focused bills across the U.S. From nations to institutions, Bitcoin adoption surges read Bitcoin price prediction to see how it’s shaping the future of finance! Bitcoin is Getting Mainstream Attention The concept of Bitcoin reserves is gaining traction internationally. Following the buzz, Bitcoin prices jumped 45% since the elections. El Salvador and Bhutan have adopted Bitcoin as part of their national strategies, while companies like MicroStrategy continue to accumulate Bitcoin as a key asset. However, some resistance remains, as seen in Microsoft’s recent rejection of a Bitcoin investment proposal. Why This Matters If passed it will be effective by September 1, 2025, with expiration on September 1, 2035. Texas’s initiative could lead the way for other states to adopt similar strategies, positioning the U.S. as a global leader in cryptocurrency adoption. With growing support from state and federal governments, Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream financial systems seems more promising than ever. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

BTFD Coin: Turning Missed Opportunities into Millionaire-Making Moments For anyone who has ever said, “I wish I got in early,” BTFD Coin is your golden ticket. Short for “Buy The F***ing Dip,” BTFD embodies the fearless mindset that turns market downturns into opportunities. And with over $3.6 million raised in its presale so far, it’s clear the community believes this coin is destined for greatness. The BTFD Presale Numbers You Need to Know The BTFD presale launched at just $0.000004 per coin. Fast forward to today, and the price sits at $0.00012, heading for a listing price of $0.0006. That’s a 5x jump for presale investors before the coin even hits major exchanges. Over 52 billion coins have already been sold to more than 4,700 investors, and the presale is now in its 11th stage. Want to join the action? Here’s what your investment could look like a $3,000 buy-in at today’s presale price of $0.00012 nets you 25 million BTFD coins. Once the coin lists at $0.0006, that investment balloons to $15,000. Miss this chance? That’s on you. Why BTFD Stands Out BTFD isn’t just another meme coin; it’s an ecosystem. With a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game already in beta, users can dive into the Bulls Squad universe, unlocking rewards while enjoying cutting-edge gameplay. Though the beta version doesn’t offer rewards, it’s just a taste of what’s to come. What’s more, BTFD offers a staking program with an average APY of 90%, giving hodlers a reason to stick around long-term. The coin is also built on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring security, scalability, and seamless transactions. This is more than a presale; it’s a movement. Join the Bulls Squad, stack your coins, and ride the wave into the next bull cycle. The next Bonk-style story is unfolding, and it’s spelt BTFD. Bonk: The OG Meme Coin That Got Away Who could forget the Bonk (BONK) phenomenon? Launched as the first Solana-based meme coin, BONK took the crypto world by storm in late 2024. With its whimsical dog-themed branding and community-first approach, BONK quickly became a darling among Gen Z investors and crypto enthusiasts. A Meteoric Rise and Missed Opportunities In November 2024, BONK reached its all-time high of $0.000062, fuelled by its listing on the Upbit exchange and a massive community token burn of 1 trillion BONK tokens. Investors who got in early saw staggering returns, turning pocket change into life-changing wealth. But like all meme coins, volatility reared its head, and BONK’s price experienced sharp fluctuations. For those who missed out, it was a painful lesson: hesitation costs. While early adopters celebrated their gains, latecomers were left wishing they’d acted sooner. Latest Developments in BONK’s Journey Today, BONK trades at $0.00004069, showing a slight upward trend as of December 2024. Its community remains strong, and recent initiatives to reduce supply aim to stabilise the coin for long-term growth. However, for new investors, BONK’s peak profitability may already be in the rear-view mirror. And that’s why BTFD is so exciting. With its presale still underway, you’re getting in at ground zero—no second-guessing, no regrets. Why BTFD Coin Is the Best New Meme Coin Presale to Join Now Bonk taught us that timing is everything here. BTFD isn’t just another opportunity; it’s your shot at being the investor others envy. With its low entry price, innovative ecosystem, and community-driven ethos, BTFD checks all the boxes for a meme coin poised to explode. Consider this: you can buy 30.5 million BTFD coins for just 1 Ethereum or snag 813 million coins with 1 Bitcoin. Even smaller investments pack a punch. With $1 USDT, you can grab 8,341 BTFD coins. Don’t let these numbers pass you by—this is your Bonk moment, but better. The Road Ahead BTFD’s roadmap is ambitious but achievable. From scaling its P2E game to securing major exchange listings, the project is laser-focused on delivering value to its community. With liquidity locked for three years and a robust tokenomics model, BTFD offers long-term stability in a market known for its unpredictability. And let’s not forget the community. The Bulls Squad is more than just a fan base; it’s a movement of like-minded investors rallying around a shared vision. This isn’t just about profits; it’s about proving that meme coins can be more than a flash in the pan. Don’t Miss the Dip—Join the BTFD Presale Today The crypto market rarely gives second chances, but that’s exactly what BTFD represents. Whether you missed out on Bonk or are looking to amplify your portfolio, the best new meme coin presale to join now is right here, waiting for you. Time is of the essence. With every passing day, the BTFD presale inches closer to its final stages. Don’t let hesitation rob you of another Bonk-style opportunity.

The price is trading above $1.050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.180 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Upside Break After forming a base above the $1.00 level, Cardano started a fresh increase like Bitcoin and Ethereum . ADA was able to climb above the $1.050 and $1.120 resistance levels. However, the bears were active below the $1.20 level. A high was formed at $1.1781 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $1.120 level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.910 swing low to the $1.1781 high. Cardano price is now trading above $1.050 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.150 zone. There is also a major bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.160 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $1.180. The next key resistance might be $1.20. If there is a close above the $1.2 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.2280 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.250. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.180 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.10750 level. The next major support is near the $1.050 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $0.910 swing low to the $1.1781 high. A downside break below the $1.050 level could open the doors for a test of $1.00. The next major support is near the $0.920 level where the bulls might emerge.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-loves-santa-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-as-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

While some attribute this strategic move to the whale’s confidence in 1Fuel as the next big player in the trading industry, some believe it’s due to the platform’s growth potential that might extend to 100x its current price. In this article, we’ll explore why these sentiments hint that 1Fuel may be the best cryptocurrency to buy now. 1FUEL: The Next-Generation Crypto Wallet for Maximum Returns 1Fuel is quickly emerging as the best cryptocurrency now for those seeking substantial returns, and it’s for good reasons. Notably, the innovation behind 1FUEL transcends typical cryptocurrency wallets, as it is designed to simplify and secure the management of digital assets. Imagine being able to conduct transactions across different blockchain networks with just one click. With features like one-click cross-chain transactions, an integrated privacy mixer, cold storage solutions, and peer-to-peer exchanges, 1FUEL is changing how users store, trade, and manage their crypto assets. Additionally, 1FUEL offers staking rewards of up to 30% APR by allowing users to stake their tokens. This means that by simply holding onto their 1FUEL tokens, investors can earn passive income while supporting the security of the network. A total of 75 million tokens are reserved for these rewards, incentivizing users to become long-term holders. Adding to the appeal of 1FUEL is the independent verification of its smart contracts, which provides peace of mind for investors. This audit safeguards your investment, allowing you to enter the market with confidence. Shiba Inu’s Hot Streak: Can It Double Its Price Again? In the last month alone, SHIB’s price jumped 57% to the current $0.00003015. Still, the trend could continue, according to some analysts. On December 7, crypto analyst “Bluntz” suggested SHIB could soar as high as $0.00006 and $0.00009, respectively about 94% and 191% above its value of approximately $0.00003089. Bluntz also noted that for this to happen, SHIB has to complete the breakout, just like in March 2024, when the RSI moved from over 70 to over 90. Currently, the RSI of Shiba Inu is over 70, indicating that the coin might continue surging. Another analyst, “King’s Chart,” offered a more cautious view, predicting a 35% rise in SHIB’s price to around $0.00004518 based on an ascending triangle chart pattern. Dogecoin’s Price Dip: A Temporary Setback or a Sign of Deeper Issues? Dogecoin’s price has fallen over 6% in the past 24 hours, now sitting at $0.43. Recently, negative sentiment around Dogecoin has grown, leading to decreased transaction activity. However, there is some hope: Dogecoin has emerged from a bullish pattern that began in November, suggesting potential for recovery. Experts believe this price drop may test a crucial support level. If it holds, Dogecoin could begin to rise again. Nevertheless, data indicates that more investors are betting against DOGE, reflecting ongoing negative sentiment. If Dogecoin can rise above its current level, it might reach new highs, particularly if an “altcoin season” occurs. Conclusion While popular meme coins like SHIB and DOGE continue to fluctuate, 1FUEL’s innovative ecosystem as well as its enticing crypto presale offerings make it a compelling investment choice for those seeking long-term gains in the crypto market. Predictions suggest that early investors might see gains of up to a staggering 100x by just buying the OFT tokens at a current price of $0.012.

In May 2024, the House passed FIT21 with bipartisan support, marking significant progress in digital asset regulation. However, the bill has faced challenges in the Senate. House Financial Services Committee’s Expanding Role in Crypto Legislation The House Financial Services Committee holds significant influence over monetary policy, housing, banking and international finance. It collaborates with the Senate Banking Committee to oversee the SEC. Recently, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Paul Atkins to lead the SEC. The committee collaborates with the House and Senate Agriculture Committees to oversee the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This partnership is crucial for drafting financial legislation on crypto market structure and stablecoin regulations, facilitating the progression of these bills to full House or Senate votes. French Hill Foresees Imminent Congressional Approval of Critical Crypto Legislation In October, Rep. French Hill showed optimism that Congress could pass key crypto legislation, including FIT21 and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, before year’s end. In September, Hill urged the Nigerian government to release detained Binance executive Tigran Gambaryan after a concerning video showed Gambaryan in poor health. Not long after, Nigeria had dropped all money laundering charges against Gambaryan. The post Pro-Crypto Rep.

And the Game of the Year Award for 2024 goes to ASTRO BOT! Congrats to everyone at @PlayStation and @TeamAsobi ! #TheGameAwards pic.twitter.com/7CG8McZPbg — The Game Awards (@thegameawards) December 13, 2024 Out of seven nominations, Astro Bot has won four, including the most prestigious award of the evening, The Game of the Year award. Other titles nominated for the Game of the Year were Black Myth: Wukong, Balatro, Metaphor: ReFantazio, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and a controversial entry, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree. Swen Vincke, director of Baldur’s Gate 3, presented this year’s award. He was the winner of last year’s Game of the Year title. He described it as changing his life. In a lighthearted comment, he said, “Should you be told to wrap it up, you can always come back and chat for three minutes.” Team Asobi’s head, Nicolas Doucet, thanked the team and PlayStation for their support with Astro and acknowledged PlayStation’s 30 years of legacy. He also recalled playing Super Mario Bros. and how Astro Bots’ foundations were based on the game. Metaphor: ReFantazio became the second notable winner Astro Bot was nominated in seven categories in The Game Awards 2024, making it the most prominent game. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was the second title, receiving an equal number of nominations. However, it took away only one award in the Best Score and Music category. Meanwhile, Metaphor: ReFantazio became the second notable winner. It won Best Narrative, Best RPG, and Best Art Direction. It was unusual for Balatro to be nominated for The Game Awards 2024 platform. So much so the developer found it “completely surreal.” Still, it took the spotlight in the Indie game category, winning the Best Indie and Best Debut Indie categories.

XRP is bouncing from the $2 level, which remains strong support, while the $3 range acts as significant resistance. The price is holding strong between $2 and $2.24 and this area must hold for the bullish scenario to remain intact. These levels are also important to monitor for any potential breakout or pullback. Bullish Pathway: There’s still a possibility for a bullish move, where the current uptrend could be the start of a larger wave. To confirm this, the price needs to break through the resistance at $2.76. If this happens, the price could push higher towards new all-time highs. Alternative Scenario – Wave Correction: Alternatively, the price could be in a corrective phase (Wave 4), where a pullback might happen. If the price sees a five-wave move down and break support, a larger correction could start. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean the trend will turn bearish, as it could still lead to higher prices after the correction. Resistance : Between $2.46 and $2.76 Support : Between $2.24 and $2.00 Next Steps for XRP: The price is currently seeing sideways price action, squeezed between support and resistance. If a pullback occurs, the support zone between $2 and $2.24 could be a great buying opportunity. From there, we may see a bounce and possibly a third-wave push higher in the longer-term scenario. Analyst Eyes $5 Target Analyst Josh of Crypto World said that XRP is forming a potential bullish flag pattern. To confirm this, the price needs to break above resistance at $2.48, and ideally surpass the previous high of $2.62. If this happens, the price target could be above $5, offering a potential 100%+ gain. In case of rejection, short-term support is at $2.24, with further support at the $2 level and around $1.95. While short-term trends are slightly bearish, these are minor pullbacks within a larger bullish market.",NEUTRAL,XRP,ALTCOIN | MARKET | TRADING | XRP,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/xrp-price-prediction-for-december-13/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Three projects have captured the spotlight this week: Qubetics, NEAR Protocol, and XRP. Each of these cryptos is making significant strides in its respective niche—whether through pioneering decentralised technology, forging strategic partnerships, or demonstrating impressive price momentum. If you want to make informed decisions and maximise your returns, these are undoubtedly the Best Cryptos to Buy Today . Let’s explore what makes them stand out. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Decentralized Security with dVPN Qubetics is at the forefront of Web3 infrastructure development, offering groundbreaking solutions addressing long-standing blockchain security and privacy challenges. One of its most anticipated innovations is the decentralised VPN (dVPN) service. Unlike traditional VPNs, Qubetics’ dVPN is built on a peer-to-peer network, ensuring that no single authority can control or censor user data. By leveraging blockchain technology, the dVPN delivers unmatched privacy, transparency, and resistance to censorship. Currently, in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers a lucrative entry point for investors. With $TICS tokens priced at $0.031, the project has raised over $5.7 million, amassed more than 8,700 holders, and sold 313 million tokens. Weekly presale phases bring a 10% price hike, culminating in a 20% increase in the final stage. The post-presale target price of $0.25 per token promises a significant return on investment. Long-term projections for Qubetics are even more enticing. Analysts predict the token could reach $10–$15 after the mainnet launch. This means early investors could see an ROI ranging from 32,028.61% to 48,092.91%. With such potential, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the Best Cryptos to Buy Today. NEAR Protocol: Strategic Growth Through Partnerships and AI Integration NEAR Protocol has been making waves with its ecosystem expansion and innovative use of AI. The addition of Deutsche Telekom as a validator has strengthened the network’s decentralisation, aligning with NEAR’s commitment to user data sovereignty. This partnership highlights the protocol’s growing credibility in the blockchain space. NEAR has also embraced artificial intelligence, introducing a cross-chain AI assistant. This tool facilitates tasks such as launching meme coins and performing web searches for fiat purchases, with future updates to enable functionalities like booking flights and ordering food. These advancements demonstrate NEAR’s focus on improving user experience and integrating real-world applications into its platform. XRP: Poised for a Historic Price Surge XRP has gained momentum, with analysts forecasting a new all-time high (ATH) of $5.85 . This prediction is based on an ABC wave analysis, which suggests the crypto has initiated its next significant rally. XRP’s recent performance, including a parabolic rally of over 200%, underscores its potential for exponential growth. Dark Defender, a prominent analyst, has also identified a bull flag on XRP’s weekly chart, pointing to a price target of $11 by early 2025. Longer-term projections indicate that XRP could climb as high as $18, making it an attractive option for investors. Conclusion This week presents exceptional opportunities in the crypto market, with Qubetics, NEAR Protocol, and XRP leading the charge. Qubetics’ presale success, innovative dVPN service, NEAR’s strategic growth through partnerships and AI, and XRP’s bullish price trajectory make these projects stand out. Investing in the Best Cryptos to Buy Today could position you for significant gains in the evolving blockchain landscape.

37571873,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52019,1734063155,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Wins New Listing On This Top Exchange,"Gemini Foundation, a derivative trading platform operated by the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange has introduced a new perpetual contract for Shiba Inu (SHIB). This broadens the trading options available to users in specific jurisdictions. This move is part of Gemini Foundation’s ongoing efforts to offer advanced trading opportunities for digital assets. The newly launched perpetual contract is priced in Gemini Dollars (GUSD), allowing users to trade SHIB against the stablecoin. The platform provides users with the potential for up to 100x leverage, which enables traders to maximize their positions with relatively small initial investments. This feature is particularly beneficial for those looking to capitalize on market movements without committing large amounts of capital upfront. This new product is part of Gemini Foundation’s broader push to expand its offering of perpetual contracts. Previously, the platform added contracts for assets like Bitcoin (BTC), XRP, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Dogecoin (WIF). The introduction of Shiba Inu alongside Bitcoin Cash and Uniswap (UNI) demonstrates Gemini Foundation’s commitment to diversifying its portfolio of derivatives. Approved Regions Gemini Foundation’s derivatives offerings, including the Shiba Inu perpetual contract, are available only in regions where derivative trading is not restricted. Unlike the main Gemini platform, which operates in the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union, the Gemini Foundation is excluded from these regions. Currently, the platform supports 32 jurisdictions, including Argentina, Bahamas, Brazil, Chile, Singapore, and Turkey, among others. Users in these regions can trade the Shiba Inu perpetual contract and speculate on the asset’s price without actually owning the underlying SHIB token. Getting Started with Gemini Foundation To begin trading, new users need to register for an account on Gemini Foundation. After creating an account, users must activate derivatives trading by selecting the ‘Activate Now’ option near the Derivatives Account section. Once activated, users can transfer GUSD or BTC into their derivatives account to start trading. Users should also review and accept the terms of service before proceeding with any transactions. This process ensures traders understand the risks and rules associated with derivatives trading. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Expanding Advanced Trading Options Gemini Foundation is not the only crypto exchange to introduce advanced trading products for Shiba Inu. Recently, Coinbase added the token to its Coinbase 50 Index Fund, an investment product that gives users exposure to 50 of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins like Tether (USDT). Similarly, Kraken has integrated Shiba Inu as a collateral asset for futures trading on its platform. The move followed Kraken’s earlier introduction of a margin trading pair for SHIB, reflecting the growing demand for more sophisticated ways to engage with the token. Despite the influx of advanced trading options, the asset’s price has faced a downturn. As of the latest market update, the asset has dropped by 16.50% in the past 24 hours, bringing its value to $0.00002501. This decline highlights the volatility in the cryptocurrency market, even amid increasing trading options and exposure for the token. The launch of the perpetual contract on Gemini Foundation marks a significant development in the expanding world of derivatives trading for cryptocurrencies. Traders now have access to a new method for speculating the popular token. However, despite the introduction of such trading innovations, the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies remains evident, as reflected in the token’s recent market performance.

37570449,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661860,1734062415,"Sell Bitcoin When This Happens, Warns Analyst—Here’s What to Watch For","Bitcoin has shown a significant recovery, reclaiming the $100,000 milestone yesterday. It trades at $101,805, marking a 1.4% increase over the past 24 hours. Amid this price performance, analysts have closely examined various metrics to gauge potential market movements, including identifying optimal cash-out moments. Meanwhile, recent data reveals intriguing patterns that could guide investor strategies. When Should You Cash Out Your Bitcoin? One key insight shared by a CryptoQuant analyst, Onchain Edge, highlights a critical signal for when investors should consider reducing their Bitcoin holdings. Other metrics suggest a resurgence in buyer activity , reinforcing optimism in Bitcoin’s ongoing rally. Onchain Edge emphasizes the importance of the BTC supply loss percentage as a marker for peak market phases . He notes that when this metric drops below 4%, it could signify the culmination of a bull market and the beginning of an overheated market phase. Currently, the current supply loss percentage stands at 8.14%, providing room for further price growth before a potential peak. The analyst warns, however, that failing to act at the right time during such peak phases could lead to substantial losses in a subsequent bear market. Elaborating on his analysis, Onchain Edge encourages investors to consider dollar-cost averaging (DCA) out of their positions once the supply loss percentage breaches the 4% threshold. It is worth noting that this strategy by Edge could help mitigate the risk of holding through the transition into a bear market. Historically, peak bull run phases are characterized by significant profits among market participants, often followed by sharp corrections . Investors can protect their gains by exiting strategically while preparing for lower entry points during future market downturns. BTC Buyer Activity Resurges Meanwhile, in a separate analysis, another CryptoQuant analyst known as Crazzyblockk sheds light on the behavior of takers on Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Data from the Taker Buy/Sell Ratio shows a shift toward aggressive buying activity. This metric, which compares the volume of buy orders filled by takers to sell orders, had experienced a period of negative monthly values, indicating a preference for selling among market participants . However, the ratio has recently turned positive, signifying renewed interest from buyers. This trend suggests reduced selling pressure and growing optimism among traders about Bitcoin’s potential price increase. According to Crazzyblockk, sustaining this momentum is critical for maintaining the bullish trajectory, particularly as Bitcoin consolidates around the psychologically significant $100,000 level .

Some are strategically choosing to divert their funds into a new protocol with the potential for large returns: Lunex Network ($LNEX). This protocol combines low fees with high levels of interoperability, and ties it together with a central focus on privacy to create the ultimate environment for professional trading. So what will the next quarter have in store for these projects? Polkadot Sees Sharp Dip Despite Polkadot 2.0 Announcement Polkadot (DOT) dropped 17% during the last week, which surprised holders, as before that, Polkadot tripled in price over the last year. Strangely enough, that dip in Polkadot’s value came just as Polkadot (DOT) released Polkadot 2.0, which should make the network scalable and also offer developers more access. It will technically involve a few tweaks from Polkadot (DOT) to reduce block times for traders. Cardano Sees Dip Despite Wallet Enhancements Cardano (ADA) has seen an 11% dip in the last week as key whales have sold off large quantities of Cardano (ADA). Cardano’s price outlook is now dwindling despite Cardano achieving a 96% increase over the last 12 months. On the technological front, Cardano has been focused on improving DB Sync and the Cardano wallet. There have also been several refinements made to the Cardano (ADA) ledger in a bit to improve network security. Lunex Network ($LNEX) Provides Powerful Tools for Traders Lunex Network offers a suite of tools for traders and companies and it is fast becoming a leader in the DeFi space. A standout is its broad portfolio tracker that manages stocks and ETFs as well as cryptos. This tool gives traders an overview of their financial state so they can make sound investment decisions at all times. With its apt utilization of the latest blockchain technology, Lunex Network supports swaps of over 50,000 assets. The platform sets a standard for other competing blockchains with ultra low fees and lightning fast transaction speeds, creating a frictionless trading experience. Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) utility extends beyond trading. Its ecosystem is powered by the native $LNEX token, designed to remain stable even in times of market volatility. Token holders enjoy a generous 18% share of platform profits, providing a passive income stream. Additionally, with a capped supply of 8 billion tokens, $LNEX incorporates a deflationary mechanism that rewards long-term investors as adoption increases. Businesses also benefit from Lunex Network’s ($LNEX) features . The platform’s merchant payment gateway simplifies the process of accepting cryptocurrency payments. Transactions are automatically converted into fiat currency, making it easy for companies to integrate digital assets without technical complications. Lunex Network Attracts Strong Interest Investors are flocking in from all over the trading spectrum to secure their share of $LNEX tokens. Currently available at a ripe price of $0.0044, leading analysts have predicted a 1800% price increase before the time of the full launch owing to the protocol’s intelligent design. This is certainly not a project to miss out on.

Let’s go! #txlege https://t.co/NJpcrnqoqx — Giovanni Capriglione (@VoteGiovanni) November 20, 2024 How A Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Will Work in Texas During the live event, Rep. Capriglione explained that the strategic bitcoin reserve bill will allow the Texas Treasury to accept donations and gifts made in Bitcoin (BTC) . “The Texas State Comptroller will be able to authorize state agencies to accept Bitcoin for state payments,” Representative Capriglione said. “Not only will Texans be able to donate Bitcoin to the strategic bitcoin reserve, but we ultimately want individuals in Texas to be able to pay taxes and fees in the form of Bitcoin.” Representative Capriglione added that Texas’ strategic bitcoin reserve account will hold Bitcoin for a minimum of five years before funds can be transferred out. Lee Bratcher, President of the Texas Blockchain Council, further told Cryptonews that all Bitcoin in the strategic bitcoin reserve will be donated by Texans and US companies. “No taxpayer funds will be spent on buying bitcoin,” Bratcher said. Bratcher – who has also helped draft this piece of legislation – believes this initiative sends a strong message to technology companies and investors. “Supporting Bitcoin and blockchain initiatives generates employment opportunities in states like Texas within emerging technology sectors,” he said. This bill is the culmination of years of hard work from the @TXblockchain_ A big thanks to Lee and the team for educating lawmakers on the benefits of Bitcoin as a long-term savings instrument. A Texas strategic Bitcoin reserve = a massive win for the Lonestar State. https://t.co/JTSoooGqh4 — Sam Lyman (@SamLyman33) December 12, 2024 Importance of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in Texas While other states in the US have been considering implementing a strategic bitcoin reserve , the bill introduced in Texas will likely have a significant impact. This is because Texas has the eighth largest economy in the world. Texas also ranks as one of the top exporting states globally. “When you are talking about a strategic bitcoin reserve and how big of a deal this is for a state like Texas, it’s huge,” Porter said. “Texas has a bigger economy than Russia.” This also means that Texas is ahead of the game when it comes to countries like Russia, which want to eventually implement a strategic bitcoin reserve . Rep. Capriglione echoed that a strategic bitcoin reserve bill is “huge for Texas,” since it will help improve the state’s financial position. For instance, he explained that sales tax in Texas can vary, noting that this tax moves around with inflation. “It’s important for us in Texas to have things that work in contrast to these shocks. There is a constant loss happening through inflation. This is just one way that a strategic bitcoin reserve can help. The bill will be structured to counter these negative effects.” Porter added that a strategic bitcoin reserve helps provide financial support for states, emphasizing that this measure is more critical at a state level versus the federal level. “A strategic bitcoin reserve can protect states against inflation, which is important since many states in the US are struggling,” Porter remarked. Texans May Be Able To Pay Taxes with Crypto Another interesting aspect of the Texas strategic bitcoin reserve is the possibility for Texans to pay their taxes using cryptocurrency. Rep. Capriglione believes that many folks in Texas will be interested in paying taxes with Bitcoin. During the spaces event, he remarked that the strategic bitcoin reserve will allow taxpayers to pay using cryptocurrency, which can then be converted to Bitcoin for the strategic bitcoin reserve. “I do believe there will be a mad dash for folks to pay their taxes using Bitcoin, especially at the beginning of this,” Rep. Capriglione remarked. “Paying a little bit of taxes in Bitcoin will help Texas have BTC in the strategic bitcoin reserve.” Bratcher added that he views this as the first step towards integrating Bitcoin into the Texas economy. “Eventually, the state will accept taxes in Bitcoin and one day, possibly make it legal tender in conjunction with Federal action,” he said. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Bill Likely To Pass While a strategic bitcoin reserve bill in Texas is promising, the legislation must be passed into law before being enacted. Yet policy makers believe that it’s likely Texas House Bill 1598 gets passed into law. “Nothing is certain, but this bill has a high chance of passing given all of the support it has received from Texas elected officials,” Bratcher commented. Indeed, Texas has a number of pro-Bitcoin government officials. For example, Texas Senator Ted Cruz previously told Cryptonews that he owns three Bitcoin mining sites in West Texas and is a huge supporter of cryptocurrency . “We have talked to Senators who are very excited about this Bill,” Rep. Capriglione added. “I expect a Senator to sponsor this soon. I do think this Bill will ultimately be signed by the Texas Governor.” If House Bill 1598 does pass into law, Texas will become the first state to implement a strategic bitcoin reserve. Texas will then serve as an example for other US States to do the same. “If you live in another State and that State has not yet filled a strategic bitcoin reserve, you can call your State Representative and Senator. You can look at the Bill Texas has filled. We still have a few months to work on this to get it perfect,” Rep. Capriglione said.

This bull run is a once-in-a-lifetime memecoin supercycle, and it’s your chance to turbo-crank the risk and chase unprecedented gains. But instead of sifting through hundreds of meme pretenders, what if you could rely on a coin to do all the hard work for you—like a stock index, only with performance that isn’t going to have you less animated than Terri Schiavo? That’s what you get with Vantard and its proprietary Memecoin Portfolio: a basket of the hottest property in the entire sector bought before they pump. In the battle to find the next meme moonshot, Vantard’s team of quants is a day early and a dollar in credit. The Vantard Meme Portfolio (VMP) already loaded up on ZEREBRO , MOODENG , and AI16Z nice and early, locking in some serious gains for early VTARD investors. But with The Don on his victory lap and global liquidity flooding the crypto market like Noah’s on a comeback tour, what meme monstrosity in the skyrocketing $140 billion market will the VMP unearth next? Vantard: Only an actual ‘tard wouldn’t want in Since launching its presale around a month ago, Vantard has already raised $931k, and for good reason: it’s been making TradFi look more lifeless than Simon Cowell’s botoxed bonce. Vantard has defecated all over the NASDAQ, dominating its year-to-date returns like a young, skilled cowboy atop a weary, senile bull. The VMP is getting called the S&P 500 of memecoins for a reason. Vantard offers degens the creature comforts of TradFi with its diversification and the reassurance of an actively managed and frequently rebalanced basket. Still, this team of quants isn’t interested in delivering a paltry 7%—they’ve got their eyes on a parabolic prize, and so far, they’ve given no reason to doubt them. Meme coin madness, but all on autopilot? Now that’s how a Giga Chad rides the supercycle. Further delving into its meme origins, Vantard’s quants recently launched a “ Boomberg Nooz ” segment, which offers some insight into their radical and somewhat unhinged methodology. So, rather than chowing down on the wily nonsense some Bloomberg anchor hack wants you to choke back, why not let Vantard red pill the living daylights out of you? No botox, no corporate bullsh*t. No wonder the smart money’s all over VTARD like a resurrected Hugh Hefner in Margot Robbie’s hot tub. Get gains: Not therapy The VMP could be your secret weapon to obliterate this bull run and finally take the edge off your son’s opulent OnlyFans addiction. We’re talking blue-chip memes, burgeoning runners, and even nano-cap nebulas, each exploding at different times thanks to various catalysts. And each ensures the VMP is consistently delivering the goods—not like your ex-wife with that furry glove. This is memecoin mayhem with none of the legwork—no 3 AM candlestick struggle sessions while your wife loads up Bumble alongside your cold and vacant side of the bed. And no getting screwed by the slippage as you thrash at your mobile, desperately trying to panic sell the latest abominable sh*tcoin to save your daughter’s college fund. The Vantard quants are the ones sobbing in family counseling—they can take the trauma that comes with making this supercycle their b*tch, and their children’s daddy issues are only surpassed by their relentless analytical mastery and their Lannister-esque strategizing. Let them suffer in silence while you 100X and plan an exit— take the kids to Disneyworld, not a Diazepam dispensary. Ready to ride, cowboy? Right now, you can get in on VTARD early at a discounted price of $0.00011 before the six-fingered degenerates get their grubby mitts all over it. But don’t hang around—like an alcoholic at their godchild’s funeral, VTARD’s presale supply is going down faster than the sacramental wine. And soon, these tokens will disappear faster than Diddy on day release. This is your one-stop shop for the memecoin supercycle—your golden ticket to the VIP suite of meme portfolio management. So take a step back, throw your hat into the ring, and let the quants turn decades of loving marriage into a divorce-driven 1000x. Want to ride the Memecoin Supercycle in style?

37569943,https://coinpedia.org/?p=392525,1734061369,Crypto vs. Banks: Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC,"The post Crypto vs. Banks: Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Federal bank regulators may soon be on the chopping block. President-elect Donald Trump’s team is exploring eliminating agencies like the FDIC, sparking a debate that could reshape America’s financial landscape. Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC could be a step toward innovation, or are we gambling with stability? What the FDIC Does—and Why It Matters The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or FDIC is the authority that keeps banks in check. It makes sure that your money remains safe even if the bank fails. This system was created after the Great Depression to build a secure banking system. People need to know their savings won’t just vanish. Trump’s idea to cut back on such oversight is bold, to say the least. During his first term, he pushed to reduce bureaucracy, saying regulations hold back the economy. Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC shows how committed he is to evolve the blockchain technology in America. His team argues that less regulation could boost innovation, especially in areas like cryptocurrency. DFIC secures banks but their recent actions show they don’t like cryptocurrencies. Crypto Dreams or Banking Nightmare? Here’s the twist: Trump wants America to lead the cryptocurrency revolution. Bitcoin, blockchain—all of it. He believes that cutting federal oversight could open the door for crypto startups and investors. He wants the U.S to become the hub for decentralized finance and outpace competitors like China. However, not everyone is in favor of closing down the regulatory authority. According to critics, shutting down the regulations could leave the banks in a vulnerable state and people will lose faith as their money will not be secured anymore. Supporters say crypto’s decentralized nature could offer a safety net—but is that really enough? What’s at Stake Traditional banks might struggle without the FDIC. People could lose confidence, and that’s dangerous. For consumers, weaker protections might leave them exposed to fraud or loss. The crypto advocates see this as an opportunity as this will give a chance to Bitcoin adoption and blockchain innovation. This could encourage global investors to shift their focus towards the U.S., which aligns perfectly with Trump’s vision to make America great. Of course, there’s a catch. Congress needs to approve any major changes, and bipartisan resistance is likely. Financial experts point to the 2008 crisis as a cautionary tale. Back then, deregulation played a big role. Could history repeat itself? What to Expect Trump’s deregulation plan is ambitious, no doubt. It’s about cutting red tape and betting on crypto as the future of finance. But the risks are real. Will the U.S. become the world’s crypto capital, or are we opening the door to financial chaos? The coming months will reveal whether this vision leads to innovation or instability. Only time will tell if Trump’s Plan to Eliminate the FDIC works or will it backfire.",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BLOCKCHAIN | BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/crypto-vs-banks-trumps-plan-to-eliminate-the-fdic/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Klein, who is currently serving as the chairman of the nuclear reform monitoring committee for Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), said nuclear energy is essential for long-term sustainability. However, he noted that these power sources would need time to scale up their infrastructure. Meeting immediate energy demands As data centers, the backbone of artificial intelligence operations, are built in countries like Japan and the US, natural gases have become necessities to meet surging power demands. Data centers are heavily reliant on energy, and the global boom of AI is pushing power grids to their limits. Natural gas is the most commonly used fuel in the US, and it is expected to account for up to 60% of new-generation projects in the coming years. While natural gas is cleaner than coal, this reliance on natural gases comes with its own set of environmental concerns, particularly related to methane emissions and long-term carbon commitments. In other places, fossil fuels are an immediate solution to the rising electricity demand brought on by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence technology. However, Klein sees these fossil fuel power sources as short-term solutions, especially because existing renewable energy and nuclear capabilities cannot be scaled up quickly enough to meet the demand. The timeline for nuclear energy According to Klein, gas will be used to assuage the boom in energy demand from AI until small modular reactors and larger plants can be built to enable nuclear energy to take its place. Major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have invested in nuclear solutions to power their AI operations. Meta recently announced plans to partner with developers for nuclear energy projects capable of delivering up to 4 gigawatts of power by the early 2030s. Similarly, Microsoft has secured nuclear power commitments, including a deal to purchase energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. Meanwhile, Google is investing in small modular reactors (SMRs) However, their methods cannot be applied universally or immediately. “ We just cannot meet this big demand for these data centers without nuclear plants if we’re going to maintain a reduction in greenhouse gases,” Klein told Bloomberg . Nuclear energy remains a sensitive topic in Japan due to the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The country has also been witnessing a downtrend in energy demands due to depopulation. However, people familiar with the problem have suggested that the situation can be turned around by building more data centers and semiconductor plants.

According to the Electric Capital report on Dec. 12, Solana ( SOL ) is the number one blockchain for new crypto developers, with annual growth up to 83%, surpassing the largest blockchain in the world, Ethereum ( ETH ). The report found that 7,625 out of 39,148 new developers this year were using Solana as their first blockchain. This number has surpassed Ethereum with 6,456 new developers and others’ blockchains with 3,383. This trend has increased every year since a few years ago. “July 2024: Solana become the first ecosystem to onboard more developers than Ethereum since 2016,” the report says. This emerging blockchain remains the second-largest ecosystem in every continent. In the Asia region, Solana almost flipped Ethereum, with more than 20% adoptions this year. Ethereum, at the same time, continues to exist as the leading ecosystem with the highest number of monthly active developers in every continent. Ethereum was dominant in the Americas and Europe regions, with more than 25% adoptions every month. Along with Base, this blockchain also records the lowest fee use case for NFTs and also owns 64% of NFT mint transactions. In DEX usage, they also captured 81% of transactions and have the highest number of unique trading wallets among the others.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly preparing multiple charges, but the letter remains vague about the specifics, such as the exact nature of the charges and how many of Musk’s companies are involved. The SEC is investigating his brain-computer interface company Neuralink and the latest letter stated that the SEC had “reopened” its probe into Neuralink this week. It also revealed that Musk’s attorney, Alex Spiro, was subpoenaed by the SEC, with threats of a process server if he didn’t comply. Amid the chaos, Musk took to his X handle and wrote, “The SEC is just another weaponized institution doing political dirty work.” JUST IN: SEC Chair Gary Gensler has issued a settlement demand to Elon Musk, threatening charges unless Musk paid within 48 hours.

He only revealed his stake on April 4, 2022, about ten days after surpassing the 5% disclosure threshold required by law. According to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, anyone who acquires at least 5% of a public company must disclose it within ten days. In May 2024, Musk agreed to testify in the SEC’s investigation but failed to comply with their deposition request, leading the SEC to seek sanctions in a San Francisco court. Experts React To Gensler’s Latest Action Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton reacted to the news, saying this is how the SEC treats the richest man in the world. He pointed out that small businesses and entrepreneurs, without the resources Elon Musk has, are likely treated even worse. Deaton brought to attention how the SEC’s actions in the LBRY case show their aggressive tactics, threatening to bankrupt Jeremy Kauffman and LBRY before even filing a lawsuit. He also said that Ripple and CEO Brad Garlinghouse spent over $150 million defending themselves in a case that didn’t involve fraud, but a failure to register and explained how most companies don’t have the resources to fight back like that.",NEGATIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | REGULATION,,0,0,coinpedia,https://coinpedia.org/news/big-breaking-secs-gensler-threatens-elon-musk-with-charges-unless-he-settles-in-48-hours/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/trumps-tariffs-trumptar-solana-memecoin-to-explode-16000-before-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

For example, analyst XO predicts a price target of $300 for Solana (SOL). Furthermore, based on the bullish technical indicators, Cardano (ADA) has started showing promising growth signs. Despite all this, DTX Exchange (DTX) is also making a name for itself as one of the best new ICOs. This presale, now in phase six, has already seen a 500% price surge. Given its potential to dominate the online trading space and tap into the growing $1.4T FX market, experts remain bullish on it. Some even foresee a 5x growth potential for this altcoin in 2025. XO: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Reach $300 Soon Solana (SOL) is seeing some green price charts right now. CoinMarketCap shows that this altcoin saw a price surge of over 5% in the past 30 days, jumping from around $200 to over $250. Crypto analyst XO excited traders with his Solana price prediction. According to his X post, this altcoin will see a big jump if it holds the low $200s as support. XO forecasts a potential surge to $300 for Solana (SOL) soon. The technicals show some good signs for the Solana crypto. For example, TradingView shows that its value is above its 50-day EMA ($213). Furthermore, its momentum indicator is at -20, which is in the buy zone and suggests this uptrend may continue. Cardano (ADA) Technicals Remain Bullish As Price Rises Cardano (ADA) is another crypto coin that is riding a bullish wave. On the one-month chart, the price of Cardano increased from around $0.50 to over $1. In other words, its value skyrocketed over 70% as per CoinMarketCap. The technical analysis for Cardano (ADA) is also bullish. According to TradingView, this crypto currency is trading above its 30-day EMA ($0.95) and its momentum indicator sits at -0.06 which is in the buy zone. Therefore, the Cardano coin may continue this bullish trajectory. Market expert Valeriya remains optimistic about Cardano as well. In her new X post, she stated that a $1.20 or even $1.25 bounce is still possible. This Cardano price prediction captures traders’ attention. DTX Exchange (DTX) Excites Traders With a 500% Surge So Far DTX Exchange (DTX) is a hot altcoin right now. Whoever bought it at the beginning of its crypto ICO event has already received 500% returns. With the addition of a listing on CoinMarketCap, countless traders are now rushing to buy DTX. This token will power the DTX Exchange platform. On this hybrid trading platform, people will get: ● Access to over 120K asset classes like gold, FX, and crypto coins. ● Transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds. ● Privacy thanks to no sign-up KYC checks. On the other hand, those who hold the DTX token will get governance voting rights as well as a portion of the trading fee revenue made by the DTX Exchange. This has led to millions of DTX tokens being sold. Currently, one DTX costs just $0.12, which is a 500% rise from its starting price of $0.02. However, this presale price will rise to $0.14 after phase seven begins. Additionally, its expected launch price sits at $0.20, which is a 66% jump from its current price. Can DTX Exchange (DTX) Soar Like Solana (SOL) & Cardano (ADA)? While Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are on a rally right now, some analysts are also bullish for DTX Exchange (DTX). This newcomer will have ties to many trillion-dollar markets and a smaller market cap. Therefore, DTX could need less money for its price to rise over time. Because of this, experts foresee a potential 5x growth for this altcoin in 2025.

Additionally, the report notes that Bitcoin’s price momentum is amplified by the concept of reflexivity – demand for BTC grows as its price rises, creating a feedback loop. Together, institutional inflows, the multiplier effect, and Bitcoin’s reflexivity are expected to make 2025 a pivotal year for the cryptocurrency. The report also emphasizes the importance of a pro-crypto regulatory climate in the US, following the confirmation of Donald Trump’s victory in the November presidential election. The outcome is widely seen as favorable for crypto legislation, with expectations of a comprehensive regulatory framework that could provide much needed clarity for the industry. The election outcome bodes well for crypto legislation, with widespread expectation of the establishment of a comprehensive regulatory framework, which includes clarifying the status of crypto assets and defining the roles of the regulatory bodies. It is expected that the CFTC’s role in crypto oversight will be extended, and the chances of the various crypto bills passing and being written into law have increased substantially. Some of the major crypto bills that will be in focus are The Payment Stablecoin Act, The Bitcoin Act – which compels the US government to build a strategic BTC reserve – The CBDC Anti-Surveillance Act, and several other bills that support crypto self-custody, crypto mining, and decentralized finance. 2025: A Watershed Year For BTC The report predicts that institutional giants such as BlackRock, Fidelity, and Morgan Stanley will continue increasing their exposure to crypto. Notably, some portfolios now allow allocations of up to 25% for crypto investments, though typical allocations remain in the 1-3% range.

Notably, countries like El Salvador and Bhutan are already actively mining and accumulating BTC as part of the wider national economic strategy. The report adds that 2025 inflows into crypto ETFs are likely to be ‘substantially higher’ than the net inflows to date. As of December 11, the total net assets in US-based spot BTC ETFs stands at $113.72 billion, according to data from SoSoValue. Despite the optimistic forecasts, the report acknowledges several potential risks that could dampen Bitcoin’s bullish trajectory. These include inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainties, and the increasing dominance of Tether in the stablecoin market. At press time, BTC trades at $100,940, up 0.9% in the past 24 hours.

37766954,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/is-the-altcoin-season-still-coming-back-in-2024,1734055944,Is The Altcoin Season still coming back in 2024,"Mixed Signals in the Crypto Landscape The crypto market braces for an eventful weekend, teetering between optimism and uncertainty after a whirlwind week of mixed signals. CPI data hit the 2.7% mark as expected—neutral, stable, unexciting—but Thursday’s PPI at 0.4% raised eyebrows, doubling the forecast. Persistent producer price pressures are like termites—they won’t collapse the house overnight, but their presence gnaws away at the foundations of stability. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank decided to add a splash of liquidity with a 0.25% rate cut, a move that’s more band-aid than cure-all for the eurozone’s sluggish growth. These developments played their part in lifting the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), which closed strong at 107 on Thursday. A resilient dollar might keep crypto inflows on a tight leash, cooling the risk-on narrative. Sure, a weak dollar boosts crypto optimism, but this isn’t that story—not yet. Let’s not sugarcoat it—the extreme greed lingered far too long, stretching nearly a month before being smacked down abruptly in Monday and Tuesday’s brutal crashes. But here’s the twist: extreme greed didn’t take long to resurface, climbing back to 80 yesterday. Today’s reading (Friday, December 13) shows this: If this all sounds familiar, it should. Two weeks ago, I explored in my article, ‘ Altcoin Season on the Horizon ?’, whether Ethereum could complete its “tasks” to confirm an altseason. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. Instead, the rally fizzled, and altcoins never got their full confirmation. Let’s go back to some of these charts to check on our main hero—or villain—in this latest altcoin debacle. Ethereum (ETH): Weekly Insight Weekly Chart Highlights: Ethereum ($ETH ) remains in a critical consolidation pattern starting before Christmas last year within the rectangle top at $4,092, while strong supporting confluences align around $3,021 at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and the 50-week MA. The recent weekly candle hints at potential exhaustion, marked by a possible hanging man pattern. Better not, still time. It’s a strong reversal candle pattern. Nie fajnie. No bueno. Traders should watch the weekly close carefully to confirm or invalidate this signal. But for now, to keep an eye on: Resistance Levels: $4,092 (rectangle top, critical breakout zone) $6,050 (rectangle breakout target and Fib extension) Key Support: $3,021 (golden pocket 0.618 Fibonacci + 50-week MA + … the rectangle mid-point ) Observations: The recent rally from $3,500 highlights buyer confidence, but RSI divergence suggests weakening momentum. A deeper correction could retest fib levels between $3,226 (0.5 Fib) and $3,021 (0.618). This week’s correction of 14.5% from the yearly high of $4,092 to $3,511 was shallow by crypto standards. However, dropping below the golden pocket at $3,021 would indicate a much more significant shift in market sentiment. This majestic rectangle continues to dominate Ethereum's macro outlook and, by extension, casts its influence over the entire altcoin market. It’s a battleground not unlike what we see in Total2, where resilience and rejection at key levels define the broader altcoin narrative. Let’s explore what Total2 reveals about the state of the altcoin market. Total2: Altcoin Market Cap Recovery 3-Day Chart Insights: Total2 paints a clear picture of resilience. Following its $1.65T rejection near the 2021 ATH, the altcoin market cap dropped 17.5% but rapidly rebounded to $1.53T. Notably, the cup-and-handle breakout remains intact, with a long-term target extending above $2T. Key Observations: Dip-buying culture is alive and well, as evidenced by the rapid rebound from recent lows. The resilience tells the story of how traders continue to seize opportunities during pullbacks. Markets are as much about psychology as they are about price action. The velocity of this rebound underscores how swiftly sentiment can pivot, flipping bullish for altcoins the moment a dip looks enticing. ETH to BTC: 12-Hour Structure Ethereum's performance against Bitcoin (ETH/BTC) reflects broader altcoin momentum. Currently, ETH/BTC sits at 0.0384, just below the prior rectangle's top. While the head-and-shoulders pattern on lower timeframes highlights bearish risks, the market structure shift (higher low) offers a bullish possibility. Key Levels to Watch: Resistance: 0.0403 (invalidate H&S, potential breakout level) Support: 0.0370 (critical zone to maintain higher low structure) 0.0346 (final support before breakdown towards the lows at 0.032) ETH/BTC’s relative strength is often a leading indicator of altseason’s health. A breakout above 0.0403, particularly if accompanied by volume, is crucial to confirm the narrative shift towards altcoin dominance. However, meeting this target alone won’t be enough. A simultaneous close above $4,100 for Ethereum and Total2 surpassing the 2021 blow-off top levels will be the ultimate confirmation. With all three conditions fulfilled, BTC dominance (BTC.D) should also trend lower, finally signaling the true start of an altcoin season. Failure to align these conditions would leave the market vulnerable to Bitcoin’s ( $BTC ) continued grip. Conclusion: Is the Nightmare Over? Despite a turbulent start to the week, altcoin fundamentals remain intact. Ethereum’s resilience above $3,500 and the rapid recovery in Total2 highlight renewed buy-the-dip enthusiasm. However, the next leg depends heavily on macro catalysts, particularly CPI and the FOMC decision. For now, traders should focus on critical resistance levels like $4,092 for ETH (plus 0.04 road-block on eth/btc ) and $1.65T for Total2 , while monitoring volume and RSI for confirmation. A breakout above these levels could mark the return of a full-fledged altcoin season.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Pepe Loves Santa (PEPESAN), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESAN is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe Loves Santa can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe Loves Santa could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe Loves Santa launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe Loves Santa on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe Loves Santa by entering its contract address – 9FuN9o4pQgF3NF1v2saWvb7b9hNKDJ1DGU6LSbur437Q – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESAN. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",POSITIVE,DOGE | SHIB,BUSINESS | DOGE | EXCHANGE | SHIB | SOL,,0,0,CryptoIntelligence,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/pepe-loves-santa-solana-memecoin-to-explode-19000-ahead-of-exchange-listing-while-shiba-inu-and-doge-lag/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png

Among the myriad options, Qubetics, Avalanche, and Polkadot stand out as innovative projects driving the future of decentralised technology. This article will explore why these cryptos are considered the Best Cryptos to Join Now , highlighting their unique features, ongoing developments, and future potential. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain Interoperability Most networks operate in isolation in the current blockchain ecosystem , creating barriers to seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability limits the potential of decentralised applications (dApps) and hampers the widespread adoption of blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining this narrative by establishing itself as a Web3-aggregated chain that unifies multiple networks into a cohesive framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality , Qubetics enhances interoperability and collaboration across ecosystems. This advancement unlocks the full potential of decentralised technologies for developers, enterprises, and users alike. Currently in Presale Phase 12, Qubetics offers an attractive investment opportunity. With weekly phases driving a 10% price hike and a culminating 20% rise in the final stage, the $TICS token is a valuable addition to any portfolio. Priced at $0.031, the presale has already raised over $5.7 million, boasting over 8,700 holders and 313 million tokens sold. These figures make Qubetics a compelling choice for investors seeking the Best Cryptos to Join Now. The seamless integration of multiple blockchains under Qubetics’ umbrella is expected to catalyse the adoption of decentralised technologies across industries, making it a frontrunner in blockchain innovation. Avalanche: A Layer-1 Powerhouse with Exponential Growth Potential Avalanche (AVAX), one of the leading layer-1 blockchain networks, has captured the attention of analysts and investors with its robust ecosystem and promising growth trajectory. Known for its high throughput and low latency, Avalanche has become a preferred platform for decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and gaming. According to crypto analysts, Avalanche’s native token, AVAX, has substantial room for growth. Notably, Kong Trading, a prominent figure in the crypto space, predicts that AVAX could rally to $1,000 by 2025. If this prediction comes to fruition, it would represent a staggering 2,027% increase from its current levels. This optimism stems from similar historical rallies in tokens like Mantra, Stellar Lumens (XLM), and Ripple (XRP). The prediction is anchored in the assumption that Ethereum’s price could rise between $10,000 and $20,000, which would likely have a positive ripple effect on other layer-1 networks like Avalanche. With its innovative technology and growing adoption, Avalanche is undeniably among the Best Cryptos to Join Now for long-term investors aiming to capitalise on exponential growth. Polkadot: The Pioneer of Blockchain Interoperability Polkadot (DOT) is another standout project that prioritises interoperability and scalability. Created by Dr Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, Polkadot facilitates the seamless transfer of messages and value across blockchains through its unique parachain architecture. Polkadot also offers lucrative staking opportunities for traders. The token provides a reward rate of 11.43%, an inflation rate of 8.83%, and a real reward rate of 2.38%. Major exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken support DOT staking, making it accessible for users worldwide. These platforms also handle the technical complexities, allowing users to enjoy staking rewards without the burdens of managing the process themselves. Conclusion In conclusion, the cryptocurrency market continues to present groundbreaking opportunities, with Qubetics , Avalanche, and Polkadot emerging as key players poised to shape the future of decentralised technology. Qubetics’ innovative approach to blockchain interoperability, Avalanche’s robust growth potential in the layer-1 space, and Polkadot’s pioneering advancements in scalability and cross-chain functionality all position these projects as top choices for investors and blockchain enthusiasts. Whether through Qubetics’ presale momentum, Avalanche’s exponential price predictions, or Polkadot’s lucrative staking opportunities, these cryptocurrencies offer compelling avenues to participate in the evolution of the blockchain ecosystem. As the market evolves, these projects exemplify the transformative potential of decentralised technologies, making them some of the best cryptos to join now.

37566531,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51987,1734052510,"Best Cryptos to Invest in Right Now: Qubetics Presale Booms, as Solana Gains 6% and Ethereum Improves Big amid Regulatory Challenges and Market Dynamics","The cryptocurrency market is facing fierce competition as major players make waves and new contenders emerge. Solana’s recent 6% price surge has spotlighted its innovative developments, while Ethereum continues to gain traction thanks to improved regulatory sentiment and high-profile investments. Amidst all this action, Qubetics ($TICS) is turning heads with a groundbreaking presale that promises to revolutionise how blockchain addresses real-world challenges. While Solana and Ethereum have paved the way for decentralised technology, Qubetics steps in to fill the gaps they’ve left behind. Let’s dive into why these three projects are the best cryptos to invest in right now. Qubetics ($TICS): Revolutionising Blockchain with Real-World Solutions Qubetics is already making gains, thanks to its cutting-edge, solution-oriented products for addressing real-life business issues. By introducing the decentralised VPN (dVPN) , Qubetics addresses privacy concerns and scalability in a way that its predecessors couldn’t. In its 12th presale stage, this project has already sold over 313 million tokens to more than 8,700 holders, raising an impressive $5.7 million. The presale is hot, with $TICS tokens priced at $0.0311, set to increase by 10% this weekend. But beyond the numbers, what makes Qubetics so special? Imagine a world where businesses, professionals, and individuals can browse securely without fearing data breaches or censorship. That’s the promise of Qubetics dVPN. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on central servers prone to hacking or outages, Qubetics leverages blockchain to create a distributed network. This means no single point of failure and unprecedented levels of security. For more information, watch this AMA Session that’s creating a buzz in the crypto world. Picture this: a journalist in a country with heavy censorship uses Qubetics’ dVPN to access and share critical information safely. Or consider a startup protecting sensitive customer data from cyberattacks while saving on infrastructure costs. Even everyday users can enjoy unrestricted streaming or protect their browsing habits from prying eyes. It’s privacy and freedom wrapped into one seamless experience. The FOMO around Qubetics is real, and for a good reason. With its practical applications and an active community backing its growth, $TICS could redefine how we think about blockchain utility. If you’re looking for the best cryptos to invest in right now, jumping into Qubetics before the presale price hike seems like a no-brainer. Solana (SOL): Scaling New Heights with Innovation Solana has been a force to reckon with in the crypto world, and its latest 6% price jump to over $230 proves it’s not slowing down. Over the past year, SOL has skyrocketed by 220%, cementing its position as the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, now at a jaw-dropping $109 billion. But what’s fuelling this meteoric rise? A major catalyst is Solana’s integration of Zero-Knowledge (ZK) rollups, a technological leap that enhances privacy and scalability. Projects like ArciumHQ and Bonsol are pioneering encrypted on-chain computations, making Solana more appealing to developers and end-users alike. This isn’t just geeky blockchain jargon—it’s a game-changer for anyone looking to build or use decentralised applications. Economic metrics also tell a compelling story. Solana’s Total Value Locked (TVL) soared from $5.6 billion in November to an all-time high of $9.5 billion in early December. That’s a 70% increase in just over a month! It’s not just TVL, though; real monthly economic activity jumped from $158 million to $409 million, proving that Solana is more than hype. Solana’s ecosystem is also thriving. Binance Labs recently invested in Perena, a stablecoin infrastructure project, boosting capital efficiency within the network. Meanwhile, Solana’s first AI Hackathon, offering $185,000 in prizes, showcases its commitment to innovation. But it’s not all smooth sailing. Issues like sandwich attacks and concerns over validator mechanisms have sparked debates about network integrity. Still, Solana’s proactive community and proposed solutions, like reintroducing a public mempool, reflect a blockchain unafraid to confront challenges head-on. If you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in right now, Solana’s mix of innovation and resilience makes it a top contender. Ethereum (ETH): The Crypto Giant that keeps Evolving Ethereum doesn’t just sit at the top of the crypto pyramid for nothing. Despite the initial hype around its ETF launch fading, Ethereum has emerged stronger with a more grounded market outlook. It’s this ability to adapt and grow that makes ETH one of the best cryptos to invest in right now. One big boost to Ethereum’s reputation is the improved regulatory environment. With new SEC and CFTC chair nominations supportive of decentralised finance (DeFi), Ethereum is gaining credibility in mainstream finance. High-profile moves, like former President Trump’s WLFI profits being channelled into ETH, further underscore its appeal. Ethereum’s real strength lies in its versatility. From NFTs to DeFi protocols, it remains the go-to platform for developers and users. The network’s layer-2 solutions, like Optimism and Arbitrum, are easing congestion and reducing fees, making Ethereum more accessible than ever. However, Ethereum’s ETHBTC trading pair has been a topic of discussion. Critics once argued that it was overhyped, but shifting perspectives now highlight its stability and potential. As the crypto market matures, Ethereum’s foundational role becomes even more evident, offering long-term value that’s hard to beat. Ethereum’s community and ecosystem are its secret weapons. Whether it’s developers creating groundbreaking dApps or institutional investors recognising its worth, ETH’s network effects are unparalleled. For anyone eyeing the best cryptos to invest in right now, Ethereum’s proven track record and future promise are impossible to ignore. Seize Your Moment Cryptocurrency isn’t just about numbers; it’s about vision, innovation, and solving real-world problems. Qubetics’ transformative dVPN technology, Solana’s relentless push for scalability, and Ethereum’s adaptability make these projects the best cryptos to invest in right now.

Oddo BHF SCA brought an initiative to increase the use case of euro-dominated stablecoin by working with a crypto technology firm. This project is projected to launch by next year. Under the newly adopted European Union regulations, stablecoin is the most anticipated digital asset due to low volatility and popular choices among crypto traders. This project comes after Societe Generale SA’s crypto asset unit in France, which already uses the euro-dominated stablecoin named EUR convertible and supervises under the new rules. Fireblocks , known as wallet infrastructure and operations, are the most accessible platform that could integrate with 60 blockchains.

37565227,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=661815,1734051647,Key Indicators Signal Bitcoin’s Next Move: Should Investors Brace For A Market Shift?,"Bitcoin has long been a focal point of interest for investors due to its cyclical nature, transitioning between periods of bullish and bearish trends. As of now, Bitcoin is reportedly within a bull market phase, according to a CryptoQuant analyst known as datascope. This phase, termed the “Orange Zone,” indicates that upward momentum is prevailing, although the market has not yet reached its peak. datascope’ analysis sheds light on the evolving Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator, a tool designed to help investors identify key market trends and make informed decisions. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Market at a Crossroads: Are Long-Term Holders Signalling a Correction or a Rally? Bitcoin Market Cycle: Current Status And Investor Outlook The Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator relies on two moving averages: a short-term 30-day average and a long-term 365-day average. A crossover of the short-term average above the long-term average is seen as a critical signal, potentially marking the transition to the market’s peak period. However, the absence of such a crossover, as revealed by datascope currently suggests that while the market is on an upward trajectory, there is still room for significant growth before reaching a potential top. The analyst elaborated that in the current bull market, Bitcoin’s price movements reflect strong momentum, signalling opportunities for investors. However, with this phase also comes the necessity for strategic vigilance. datascope analysis also highlights the importance of preparing for corrections as prices approach the “red zone” (in the chart attached above), a stage associated with heightened risks. The analyst noted: As long as the 30-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average remains above the 365-day Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator moving average, the long-term outlook will stay positive. However, as prices approach the red zone, the risk of corrections may increase. Therefore, it is crucial for investors to remain cautious during this period and consider taking profits when necessary. Key Takeaways For Investors datascope suggested that investors aiming to capitalize on Bitcoin’s ongoing bull market should focus on strategic entry and exit points. The analyst added: Although the current bull market shows strong momentum, it is vital to take market fluctuations into account and monitor price movements strategically. Following critical signals such as the crossover of moving averages can help investors identify opportunities more effectively during this period. Meanwhile, Bitcoin has recently seen a noticeable rebound in its price after reclaiming the $100,000 price mark yesterday. At the time of writing, the asset trades at a price of $101,639 increasing by 1.9% in the past day. Related Reading: Bitcoin On Track For $275,000?

37566530,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51996,1734051615,How PropiChain’s AI Integration Is Revolutionizing Real Estate Investment For Massive 2025 Growth,"PropiChain has been making waves in the crypto market with its unique approach to revolutionizing the real estate sector with its AI integrations and Metaverse capabilities. The real estate industry has been plagued with several problems since the 2007-2008 financial crisis, which plummeted homes and commercial space. However, with AI technology, the real estate market can tackle inefficiencies and fraud risks and simplify complex transaction processes for users. Expert analysts believe this AI innovation could redefine how investors engage with Real Estate markets globally. Therefore, this article will explore how these AI technologies impact RWA investment in blockchain and what investors will gain when participating in its presale. How is PropiChain AI Technology Creating A Pathway in Real Estate Investment? The importance of AI in the 21st century cannot be understated, as it helps manage and automate processes that reduce the risk of human error, speed up complex processes, and minimize the need for manual intervention. PropiChain uses these AI integrations to address major loopholes and inefficiencies in traditional Real Estate investment by democratizing access to global markets and reducing lengthy settlement times. Below is a detailed narrative of PropiChain AI implementations and how they assist users in making better investment decisions. Automated Valuation Model (AVM): This AI tool assists users by bringing unparalleled accuracy to property valuations as they navigate the platform. Its sophisticated algorithm also helps analyze vast amounts of data, including historical sales reports, market conditions, and economic indicators, to reflect the actual value of a real estate asset.This AI tool offers insights beyond analyzing reports. It also detects patterns and trends that might elude human analysts, identifying major and minor shifts in neighborhood dynamics. AI-powered Chatbots: For users having challenges navigating the PropiChain platform, these AI-powered chatbots provide support and guidance, simplifying experiences and making them more intuitive and user-friendly for novice and experienced investors. Its virtual assistance tools also help break down complex processes, such as understanding legal contracts and financial terms, providing easy-to-understand explanations without any financial or legal background. Property Filtering & Suggestions: This AI-powered filtering system filters real estate assets based on market growth/trends, historical performance, and investment potential. This advanced AI also extends to filtering options for small-scale investors working on a budget who would also love to participate in managing multiple investment properties. In addition, these property suggestions allow AI to assess risks in real-time, safeguarding investors against potential losses and ensuring optimal asset allocation. Statistical Market Analysis: The PropiChain market analysis tool uses AI to analyze market data to identify high-yield real estate opportunities, enabling smarter investments. It also provides real-time evaluation of market trends and offers statistical insight into a real estate asset’s future price predictions, ensuring investors position themselves and avoid potential market risks. Other Key Features: Metaverse Integrations and RWA Tokenization Other features of PropiChain are its Metaverse integrations, which allow international investors to experience an immersive 3D virtual environment through tours, stagings, and meetings. Likewise, PropiChain bridges the gap between the physical and virtual worlds by tokenizing Real Estate and introducing the fractional ownership of assets. Through asset fractionalization, investors can own portions of high-value properties, democratizing access to Real Estate wealth rather than limiting it to top-scale investors. Expert analysts and top crypto whales believe this innovative approach opens new opportunities for investors and developers as these features cement its reputation as a secure and promising investment opportunity. Conclusion PropiChain stands out as a leader in the real estate industry because of its ability to combine the power of AI, RWA tokenization, and the Metaverse, which creates a groundbreaking platform for real estate investment. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and security review on BlockAudit are testaments to its transparency and credibility as it projects significant growth potential. In addition, its presale price of $0.004 is the lowest it will ever be, as its current round two presale stage still offers investors the opportunity to experience significant growth from $500 to over $100,000 when it launches into the mainstream market. Avoid FOMO and invest today to be a part of this revolutionary project shaping the future of Real Estate investment.

37564875,https://cryptonews.com/?p=319185,1734050789,Shiba Inu Burns 17M Tokens – Could a Parabolic Rally Be Next?,"17 million Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens were burnt in the last 2 days, data provided by shibburn.com suggests. That makes for a good title, but actually, that only amounts to tokens worth around $500 being burnt. That’s pretty minuscule in the grand scheme of things, with Shiba Inu’s market cap around $16.58 billion as of Thursday. Still, in a world dominated by highly inflationary fiat currencies, where the M2 US dollar money supply is up by around 50% since 2020 per TradingEconomics data , it’s a reminder of the benefits of non-inflationary cryptocurrencies. Of course, protection against inflation isn’t really a narrative for meme coins like Shiba Inu, that’s more the realm of Bitcoin (BTC) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a much more speculative bet, a meme coin that relies upon hype cycles, and its ever-growing and highly dedicated community of followers, investors and aficionados. While the latest deflation figures from shibburn.com are unlikely to move the needle for Shiba Inu, there are plenty of other reasons for investors to be excited right now. Shiba Inu – Could a Parabolic Rally Be Next? $SHIB was last trading just above $0.000028, within recent ranges and close to its 21DMA. The stunning rally in early November thanks to President Trump’s US Presidential election victory has mostly petered out at this point. But Shiba Inu’s strong bounce from its 50DMA earlier this week suggests the bulls remain in control of this market and price predictions remain bullish. And that should come as no surprise, given all the positive developments going on in the USA right now. The incoming US administration is set to be the most pro-crypto in history, and the new Congress, also very pro-crypto, is expected to deliver regulatory certainty to the industry next year. Trump was literally jawboning about how he will “do something great with crypto” during his upcoming term. BREAKING US PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS “ WE WILL DO SOMETHING GREAT WITH CRYPTO ” YOU ARE SERIOUSLY NOT BULLISH ENOUGH. MEGA PUMP IS COMING pic.twitter.com/OLNOaSijk5 — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) December 12, 2024 It’s a great time in the crypto space, and meme coins , which are one of the best-performing crypto sectors this year, are likely to do very well in the coming months. But that won’t mean a gradual grind higher. Meme coins like Shiba Inu tend to experience rapid parabolic moves higher.

So, if parabolic rallies are right around the corner for Shiba Inu, how high could the meme coin go. Well, once the meme coin breaks above its prior record levels of just under $0.000090 and enters price discovery, it’s really anyone’s guess. But a rally towards the 3.618 or 4.236 Fibonacci extension from the 2023 lows back to the 2021 highs suggests gains of as much as 10x from current levels are very possible. That would see $SHIB attain a market cap of over $150 billion. That may seem ridiculous, but if Bitcoin hits $200,000, that would see its market cap exceed $4 trillion. In this scenario, SHIB’s market cap would only amount to about 4% of Bitcoin’s, which is to unbelievable when considering its position as a leading meme coin in the market. Either way, the near-term future looks very bright for the meme coin space and Shiba Inu, though, as ever, these are incredibly volatile markets. In order to reap big gains, investors also need to be able to HODL through rapid and aggressive downturns.

37564761,https://timestabloid.com/?p=52017,1734049839,Atomic Wallet Ready to Delete Account if XRP Ever Surpasses $3 Again,"The recent price movements of XRP have raised new debate within the cryptocurrency community, with critics warning of a prolonged downturn for the digital asset. Among the skeptics is Atomic Wallet, a decentralized non-custodial wallet, which has drawn attention for its recent remarks criticizing XRP and its investors. Concerns Over Sustainability of Gains The asset recently achieved a milestone by hitting a seven-year high of $2.87, following an impressive 485% surge over four weeks. However, this upward trajectory faced a setback during a market-wide correction, with the token’s value dropping to $2.34—over 32% below its peak. While XRP supporters celebrated the significant gains, critics, including Atomic Wallet, raised doubts about the sustainability of the asset’s rally. They pointed to the token’s historical pattern of sharp corrections following rapid price increases. Atomic Wallet’s Bold Prediction In a controversial tweet, Atomic Wallet questioned whether XRP holders are prepared for the asset’s value potentially declining to $0.50. The wallet further asserted that the asset would not reach $3 again and committed to deleting its X account if the token surpassed that level in the future. This criticism comes after it previously made sarcastically bullish remarks about the token. For instance, on December 2, the wallet jokingly stated it would not sell its XRP holdings until the price reached $300. Community Responds Atomic Wallet’s statements have sparked a backlash from XRP supporters. Community members have accused the wallet provider of spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) about the digital asset. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Prominent voices within the community, such as Panos Mekras , have called for a complete boycott of Atomic Wallet and urged users to switch to alternative platforms. Critics have also highlighted Atomic Wallet’s security record, referencing a multi-million-dollar hack in 2023 as evidence that the company should focus on securing its services rather than commenting on market trends. The backlash has also drawn attention to Atomic Wallet’s seemingly contradictory stance on XRP. Previously, the wallet encouraged its users to buy the asset and had shared positive commentary about it. Despite the controversy, the asset remains a topic of interest in the cryptocurrency space. While skeptics warn of extended downturns, supporters believe in its long-term potential, emphasizing its role in cross-border payments and blockchain technology.

Trump’s Tariffs (TRUMPTAR), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPTAR is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tariffs can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tariffs could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tariffs launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tariffs on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tariffs by entering its contract address – 4rb7G52aMoXnusvS6eB27CRBXkUe9NmCbYnp4WZRyUiq – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPTAR.

A compliance consultant on LinkedIn named Stephen Sergent, on Chainalysis’s move, jokingly remarked how he can now lose his shirt on these meme coins compliantly. Pump.fun lost the British market following the FCA’s operational ban in the UK While Chainalysis’s move to support Solana memecoins promises that governments can easily track scams and fraud involving these tokens, some governments have already lost trust in the Solana meme coin launchpad. For starters, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has restricted the use of Pump.fun in the country. The FCA first cautioned users against the platform on December 3, warning them of potential scams. The agency said the platform targeted UK crypto consumers despite being unauthorized to operate. Currently, UK-based users can no longer access Pump.fun. Any user who tries to use the Pump.fun website from the UK is notified of the instituted restricted access . However, the FCA did provide a link for users to withdraw their coins in their private wallets. The regulatory authority still maintains that customers using unauthorized firms like Pump.fun risk losing their funds.

37563899,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=626804,1734048702,MicroStrategy wins Bitcoin miners’ approval for convertible note strategy,"Bitcoin miners are taking notes, literally, from MicroStrategy’s aggressive financial strategy. Riot Platforms and MARA Holdings are now following the playbook, issuing convertible notes to buy Bitcoin. Clearly, these guys are no longer satisfied with just validating transactions and earning rewards. Instead, they’re mimicking MicroStrategy (MSTR) CEO Michael Saylor’s tactic of turning corporate resources into a Bitcoin stockpile machine. Wall Street’s obsession with the skyrocketing MSTR—up over 600% this year—is impossible to ignore. Hedge funds are loving the opportunity, deploying arbitrage strategies that take advantage of Bitcoin’s infamous volatility. Miners can’t keep up with MicroStrategy’s pace Despite the hype, Riot and MARA aren’t seeing the same success as MicroStrategy. Since the software company started its Bitcoin-buying spree in 2020, Riot and MARA shares have underperformed. Both remain far below their 2021 highs. The April Bitcoin halving event didn’t help. It slashed the rewards miners earn for adding new blocks to the blockchain, putting a major dent in profits. Throw in increased competition, and miners are now fighting an uphill battle to stay relevant. Riot’s convertible notes have raised eyebrows though. The notes came with a 32.5% conversion premium, lower than MicroStrategy’s November issuance, which had a 55% premium. Riot is also facing pressure from activist investor Starboard Value, which recently took a stake in the company. Starboard is pushing the miner to shift some of its operations toward hyperscalers—large-scale data center users—rather than focusing solely on Bitcoin mining. Meanwhile, analysts are questioning the long-term viability of using convertible debt to stockpile Bitcoin. Stephen Glagola from JonesTrading has expressed doubts about this strategy, saying, “We would prefer the company to increase BTC held per share organically with its mining operations.” Meanwhile, investment giant BlackRock is cautiously endorsing Bitcoin as part of diversified portfolios. The firm suggests investors allocate up to 2% to Bitcoin but only if they’re prepared to stomach its wild volatility. MicroStrategy on its way to Nasdaq 100, critics weigh in MicroStrategy is now eyeing a spot in the Nasdaq 100 Index, a move that could trigger massive passive inflows into its stock. Exchange-traded funds worth $451 billion track the index, and inclusion would mean huge stock purchases. But not everyone is sold on the idea. Critics argue that MicroStrategy’s reliance on Bitcoin makes it more of a financial entity than a technology company. Michael Lebowitz from RIA Advisors went as far as calling it “essentially a dead company” without its Bitcoin holdings. Despite the criticisms, MicroStrategy has amassed a $98 billion market cap, largely due to its aggressive Bitcoin acquisitions. The company now holds over $40 billion in Bitcoin, but its core software business isn’t doing so hot. It reported a $340 million net loss in Q3 this year. Still, its Bitcoin-focused strategy has kept its stock soaring, even as skeptics question its sustainability. MicroStrategy has branded itself as a “Bitcoin Treasury Company.” This identity could work in its favor for Nasdaq inclusion, as the index excludes financial companies. Its classification as a technology company by the Industry Classification Benchmark might be its saving grace. But Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart has warned that a reclassification could be on the horizon, jeopardizing its eligibility.

That emerged recently when CZ’s tweet about a leading crypto-centered travel platform saw its token rise exponentially within an hour. The crypto billionaire’s tacit endorsement of Travala on X spurred a 300% spike in the platform’s AVA token price. CZ was responding to Travala’s post celebrating a significant milestone in its revenues. His tweet came out as a tacit endorsement of Travala renewing interest in it. His post went: We invested in this crypto travel platform pre-COVID, pre-crypto winter, and held on. BUILD. ~Changpeng Zhao In 2024, Travala grew its 2023 gross revenue by over 67% Travala has made big strides in consolidating its position within the crypto-travelling/hospitality niche. In 2024, for instance, it recorded annual revenues of over $100 million, a massive jump from the $59.6 million it earned in 2023. The firm attributes that spike to an uptick in flight and accommodation bookings on its platform. Users can make reservations for these services in 100+ cryptocurrencies. Buoyed by this result, Travala announced it would be setting up its Bitcoin and AVA reserves. It says that the move was vital in expanding its financial muscle. With these additional funds, the company intends to strengthen its foothold within the blockchain-based travel industry and enhance its incentives program. The firm has pushed innovation in the travel sector Travala has always championed innovation in the travel sector. For instance, it pioneered crypto bookings using different digital assets. It also introduced Dtravel, a decentralized alternative to Airbnb. Unlike other P2P travel market services, Dtravel hosts have a share in the platform. Meanwhile, Binance is ramping up its blockchain investments. This year alone, its investment arm Binance Labs, undertook various major projects. One of these is its collaboration with Kernel to develop restaking infrastructure on its BNB Chain. This infrastructure will support the integration of tokens like BTC and BNB. Again, Binance pivoted into decentralized scientific research by investing in the BIO Protocol to expand funding in the area. It also funded Lombard, which specializes in Bitcoin liquid staking. These developments highlight its commitment to supporting new projects across the blockchain ecosystem.

37564760,https://timestabloid.com/?p=51992,1734048047,"XRP Price Rally Inspires Interest in an Overlooked Altcoin with Similar 16,509% Potential","The XRP price is making waves again; this time, it’s because of its massive gains in the past 30 days.
