""Self-custody is a fundamental human right,"" Zhao tweeted Sunday. ""You are free to do it at any time. Just make sure you do it right.""  Zhao's push for self-custody comes as investors rethink how to keep their assets safe in the wake of cryptocurrency exchange FTX's collapse and a subsequent hack that drained $600 million worth of coins from its wallets. Acquired by Binance in 2018, Trust Wallet is a decentralized hot wallet facilitating the storage of cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens. It is compatible with several blockchains.  Trust Wallet Token (TWT) is the wallet's official token, allowing holders to participate in decision-making related to app features and updates. The token has soared 80% in the past 24 hours to a record $2.3, according to data source Messari.  Zhao recommended investors start with small amounts and get comfortable with the technology to avoid mistakes that can be very costly. Zhao added that Trust Wallet facilitates the self-custody of crypto. ""@TrustWallet your keys, your coins,"" Zhao said in another tweet.  ""You have not bought bitcoin until you receive it in a wallet for which you control the private keys to,"" Blockware Solutions said in a market intelligence newsletter published Friday. ""The repeated, reckless handling of user funds by exchanges is proof that you cannot trust that these institutions actually have the bitcoin you purchased.""  ""The 'not your keys, not your coins' mantra rings truer than ever,"" Ilan Solot, co-head of digital assets at London-based Marex Solutions, said in an email.  Investors have been moving coins off exchanges since FTX went down.

The failure of a third-party partner means services will be delayed for as long as 10 days, the Hong Kong-based company said Sunday. The exchange did not identify the partner, and has said it has no exposure to FTX, a rival whose collapse has caused chaos in the industry.  “Withdrawals have been suspended to avoid fraud and exploitation,” the company said. “AAX will continue our best efforts to resume regular operations for all users within 7-10 days to ensure the utmost accuracy.”  Users’ balances have to be manually restored after a partner failed, causing the system to record abnormal data, the company said. Vice-President Ben Caselin tweeted that the delay was being taken as an “extra precaution” following scheduled maintenance.  On Friday, the company, which launched in 2019 as the first crypto user of the London Stock Exchange Group’s (LSEG) matching technology, said it had no financial exposure to FTX or its affiliates. It stores a “substantial amount” of its assets in cold wallets and doesn't lend out user funds to venture activities, it said.

Although a number of pro-crypto candidates from both sides are in, crypto exchange FTX’s fresh collapse will likely spell more regulations for the space.  The result was called on Sunday, five days after the elections were held, with election officials still counting votes for several members of the House of Representatives. It is not yet clear which party will control the lower body of Congress.  It’s also unclear how much the election outcome could sway crypto legislation already in the works, as the laws have had bipartisan support and the key lawmakers behind the initiatives remain in office. The crypto industry made a concerted effort to make its mark on Capitol Hill this year, and a number of proponents from both parties have won their respective races.  But the market could be a wild card.  On the day of the election, Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of FTX, made a surprise announcement on Twitter that rival platform Binance had signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire FTX. In the days that followed, the deal was scrapped and the once multi-billion dollar exchange filed for bankruptcy on Friday. Over the weekend, FTX and FTX US were hacked with $600 million worth of crypto moved off the exchange.  Crypto prices across the board took a nosedive following the news, with bitcoin price dropping 22% in the last seven days, according to CoinMarketCap data on Sunday.  Bankman-Fried, who said he had spent much of his time talking to lawmakers and regulators in D.C. these last months, may still influence crypto rules, but not in the way he might have intended.  Several key Senators within the Democratic Party have expressed concern over the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, which was led by major election donor Sam Bankman-Fried. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who will continue to chair the Senate Banking Committee, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who sits on that committee, have both called for investigations into the exchange.

Here's what happened, from beginning to end-ish: Monday The rapid meltdown of Bankman-Fried's crypto empire came about after crypto exchange rival Binance, an early investor in FTX, said it would offload the rest of its holdings in FTX token ( FTT-USD ), the coin issued by FTX. That was ""due to recent revelations"" likely referring to a CoinDesk story from the prior week that raised questions about the overlap between FTX and SBF's trading firm, Alameda Research. Alameda's balance sheet reportedly owned $5.8B of FTX token ( FTT-USD ) as of June 30, accounting for a huge portion of its $14.6B in total assets, thus highlighting the close ties between FTX and Alameda despite the fact that they're two separate entities. The troubling part was how much of FTT that Alameda owned compared with roughly 200M FTT coins in circulation worth $4.56B at the time. The price of FTX token ( FTT-USD ) slid some 30% to $16.47 on November 7 as market participants weighed Alameda's financial health as well as a simultaneous slump in FTX token ( FTT-USD ). In the initial uncovering of Alameda's finances, SBF shrugged off growing speculation about the solvency of FTX, saying its ""assets are fine"" and it ""has enough to cover all client holdings."" Tuesday FTX was said to have seen around $6B of customer withdrawals over the past three days, well above the typical average daily flows in the tens of millions of dollars range, as the exchange came under liquidity pressure as investors became more worried about its insolvency risk. Looking at on-chain data at the time, the exchange appeared to have suspended processing withdrawal requests from its clients (which later proved to be a more than 48-hour pause), as FTX struggled to fill the overwhelming amount of withdrawal requests in the wake of its liquidity crunch. In turn, FTT token ( FTT-USD ) dropped to just $3.59, and the liquidity crunch became that more serious. Binance appeared to come to the rescue by signing a non-binding deal to buy the non-U.S. portion of FTX, with both SBF and Binance chief Changpeng Zhao confirming the agreement via Twitter. Of course, the acquisition was not guaranteed. Wednesday Binance walked away from its initial offer to buy FTX.com due to reports about fund mishandling and regulatory issues at the exchange. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission probed FTX on whether it appropriately handled client funds, as well as its financial relationship with FTX US, the American division of FTX, and FTX's sister company Alameda. ""In the beginning, our hope was to be able to support FTX’s customers to provide liquidity, but the issues are beyond our control or ability to help,"" Binance wrote in a Twitter post. While Binance's move to back out of its letter of intent to buy FTX.com was widely expected, cryptos like bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ethereum ( ETH-USD ) collapsed by double-digit percentages, underscoring the negative implications of FTX's collapse for the cryptoverse. Binance's retreat forced FTX to scramble for rescue financing. In fact, SBF reportedly told investors that his exchange would need to file for bankruptcy unless it could garner more capital to cover its $8B shortfall. The crypto ""industry is due for some soul-searching,” said Mikkel Morch, chairman at crypto hedge fund ARK36. But there's some positive developments underway following FTX's downfall, including Binance ""pushing for major exchanges to adopt proof of reserves as an industry standard. Some have already started publishing it. Newcomers to the space are discovering the importance of self-custody of their assets,” he added. Thursday: The final nail in the coffin The Wall Street Journal reported that FTX.com loaned out more than half of its customer funds to back risky wagers by Alameda, prompting the exchange's downfall. Specifically, FTX was said to have $16B in customer assets but lent $10B of those funds to Alameda. SBF took to Twitter and apologized for his mistakes, pledging to use ""every penny"" the liquidity-strapped exchange has to repay its users. He wrote that Alameda was ""winding down trading"" and ""one way or another, soon they won't be trading on FTX anymore."" He said that he should've been more transparent with communication, and he also misjudged users' margin given ""a poor internal labeling of bank-related accounts,"" which was once of the main reasons why Binance backed away from its proposed FTX deal. The 30-year-old claimed that FTX.com still has a chance to survive despite its ongoing liquidity crunch, noting ""there are a number of players who we are in talks with, LOIs, term sheets, etc.” Friday In the face of its multibillion-dollar shortfall and its inability to meet a colossal amount of customer withdrawals, SBF stepped down from his CEO role as FTX Group, comprised of FTX.com, FTX.US, Alameda Research and ~130 affiliated entities, have all filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in the U.S. That doesn't necessarily mean that FTX is going fully under, but instead the exchange, founded in 2019, can continue operating as it determines how to pay its creditors. While SBF made claims all week that FTX.US was not impacted by FTX.com's crisis, the former reportedly stopped processing withdrawals at about midday New York time on Friday. What's at stake for the crypto space? The knock-on effects for the broader crypto ecosystem has only started to take hold. Troubled crypto lender BlockFi, for instance, paused client withdrawals due to the ""lack of clarity"" on the status of SBF's crumbling empire. And Bloomberg reported that SoftBank Group ( OTCPK:SFTBY ) ( OTCPK:SFTBF ) ( OTCPK:SOBKY ) had invested nearly $100M in FTX.com but expects to write off the full value of its stake. This week's events certainly weren't the first major blow to the crypto space. In May, the Terra ecosystem failed, and crypto lender Celsius and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital filed for bankruptcy protection, resulting in depressed token prices, industry-wide pain and regulatory scrutiny. Some industry experts suggested the FTX drama will only add to those developments. ARK36 CEO and Executive Director Anto Paroian noted that given FTX's ""diverse ties"" to the crypto industry, ""it will take weeks before we see the full extent of the damage done.""

42411326,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1glN0Hk,1668354300,"All Custodial Crypto Exchanges Should Adopt Proof-of-Reserve Programs, but Even That Isn’t Enough","Last week FTX, once the third-largest crypto exchange by volume, owned and run by founder Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), went through a meltdown. Here’s how that went down:  On Nov. 2, a CoinDesk scoop showed that Alameda Research, SBF’s quantitative crypto trading firm, had a funny-looking balance sheet  On Nov. 6, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, founder and CEO of the largest crypto exchange, Binance, announced his firm would sell all of the FTT, FTX’s exchange token (more on that below), that it held  Then, FTX claimed there were no issues at FTX  Then, FTT’s price tanked  Then, we got this headline: FTX Agrees to Sell Itself to Rival Binance Amid Liquidity Scare at Crypto Exchange  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  I think it’s more accurate to attribute FTX’s fall to a “solvency issue” rather than a “liquidity scare” (which just means FTX owed people some money and it couldn’t pay). But that doesn’t really matter because this potential purchase was subject to a due diligence process.  That due diligence process took almost no time at all before we got another CoinDesk scoop: Binance Is Strongly Leaning Toward Scrapping FTX Rescue Takeover After First Glance at Books  … followed hours later by official confirmation: Binance Walks Away From Deal to Acquire FTX  The market, unsurprisingly, was puking everywhere as it grappled with sparse details as events unfolded in real time. Binance ultimately pulled out of the deal because FTX’s issue were ""beyond [Binance’s] control or ability to help.""  A crude description of what this means is that FTX would be unable to satisfy customer withdrawal requests for the funds stored on its platform because FTX had been doing all sorts of things with those deposited funds and those things turned out to be bad for the value of the deposited funds. Now, this is a relatively normal practice. Even your local credit union does things with funds you deposit with them; “doing stuff” wasn’t FTX’s transgression.  By way of example, when you deposit money into a bank account, the bank lends your money out to other customers who want to buy cars, houses or a new gaming rig in exchange for an interest rate. Some banks do more exotic things, like allow customers to put up collateral (like a stock, bond or cash) to borrow some other asset to trade it. Herein lies FTX’s transgression.  FTX was doing that. It allowed customers to borrow things like bitcoin for cash to make trading bets. That’s all fine and dandy as long as FTX manages risk responsibly (whatever that means) and is transparent with its customers (much clearer, just tell customers everything).  Where FTX went wrong, besides the lack of transparency, was behavior regarding FTT, its native crypto token. FTT is like an equity stake in FTX itself, because every so often FTX uses its profits to buy some FTT off the open market (which should increase FTT’s price because of supply and demand). Customers were allowed to deposit FTT with FTX and use that as collateral to borrow other crypto assets or cash to make trading bets.  Now it’s not immediately obvious but this is an awful idea. Here’s why:  If the health of FTX is even remotely questioned (like how a company with the same founder in the same industry has a funny-looking balance sheet), then its equity (or things that are sort of equity) loses value. And if FTX is holding a lot of FTT on behalf of customers who are making trading bets, then that FTT is less valuable collateral, which means that the health of FTX degrades, which means FTT would lose value.  And so on and so forth.  You know what this sounds like? Yeah, it sounds like how roughly $60 billion of value evaporated basically overnight in May 2022 with the collapse of Terra.  Dizzy yet? Me, too. Let’s pause for a moment.  I’m not sure about you, but this sounds like something else I’ve heard about before. That is: What was happening in the leadup to the Great Financial Crisis in 2007 when financial institutions were doing all sorts of exotic things with mortgages, and taking trading bets on the performance of those mortgages.  So given the insistence of crypto-natives to avoid the failings of traditional finance (TradFi), what has the reaction been from people in the industry?  One of the more reasonable calls to action has been the urging for cryptocurrency exchanges to implement “proof-of-reserves” to combat the huge loss in credibility the collective body of cryptocurrency exchanges just felt.  So what is proof-of-reserves and how can it save us?  Proof-of-reserves is basically a fancy way of saying: “Hey, here’s proof that we have what we say we have.”  A very simple example: Let’s say you have 1 bitcoin that you bought on an exchange called “Shh! Just Trust George” and you leave it there for the exchange to take care of it on your behalf. For all intents and purposes, that 1 bitcoin is your bitcoin; Shh! Just Trust George is just holding it for you. Because of the transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain, there should exist some proof (cryptographic or whatever) that Shh! Just Trust George does in fact have your 1 bitcoin in its reserve.  From a finance-talk perspective, Shh! Just Trust George should be able to easily prove that its assets, the bitcoin it holds, match up with its liabilities, the promise that Shh! Just Trust George will give a customer their bitcoins when they ask for them.  Some proponents, like CoinDesk columnist Nic Carter, have been urging cryptocurrency exchanges to implement this for a while. Some have, like Kraken and BitMEX, and since the FTX-and-related meltdown the likes of Binance, OKX, KuCoin, Poloniex and Huobi have all promised to issue a proof-of-reserves attestation (or similar) in the coming days, weeks or months.  Papering over some technological details, there’s a way to use Merkle trees, which are data structures used in bitcoin, to do this in a sleek and cost-effective way. I think this is great. We should aspire for more transparency in our financial services, and proof-of-reserves could provide that.  But there’s a missing piece to the practical implementation of proof-of-reserves that enterprising readers might recognize as a potential flaw. In practice there will likely also have to be a third-party auditor hired to attest to the proof-of-reserves (as Kraken has).  You might see where this is going … more third parties, more potential centralizing choke points. So while implementing proof-of-reserves is a massive step in the right direction, it is certainly still not enough.  We need more than proof-of-reserves  Here are two of the (potentially many) reasons why we need more than proof-of-reserves from crypto exchanges:  We’re still partially depending on humans. Sure, these are humans at audit firms, but the humans at defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen didn’t catch that the humans at Enron were engaged in fraud.  While a proof-of-reserves attestation might show that an exchange does in fact have the bitcoin (or other asset) you asked it to hold for you, there’s no guarantee it hasn’t done a bunch of other stuff with your funds.  So human fallibility can still upend proof-of-reserves. Somehow the hefty financial rewards that come with the financial shenanigans needs to be outweighed.  Here, though, are some shreds of hope.  Modern finance has consistently seen busts that are worse than the booms that preceded them. And the busts have hurt enough people in a short enough timespan that these people will demand more clarity and transparency going forward. If customers don’t, the policymakers will be sure to try to make that happen (even though it hasn’t really been successful so far yet).  On top of that, at risk of sounding like a Luddite, I also think consumers are wising up to one of the problems with contemporary business: complexity.

FTT tokens follow an unlocking schedule wherein large batches of the tokens are periodically released. On Sunday, however, the tokens were released out of schedule without warning or communication from FTX or related parties.  Over 192 million FTT tokens were released, blockchain data shows. These were released from the main deployer address.  Binance founder Changpeng Zhao noted on Twitter: “Binance has stopped FTT deposit, to prevent potential of questionable additional supplies affecting the market. Also encourage other exchanges to do the same.”  Justin Sun-backed Huobi Global followed the move shortly afterwards. “(We) will closely monitor the situation,” Sun tweeted.  The FTT release follows the week-long drama involving FTX, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Friday. Contagion risks are now permeating throughout the broader crypto market.  The FTT token fell 18% on Sunday to $1.78. The spectacular collapse of the FTX exchange has led to price declines on eight of the past nine days, leaving it down 93% just in November alone.  A year ago, FTT's market capitalization stood at around $8 billion, and now it's down to about $350 million, according to CoinGecko, though the new questions about the token's circulating supply might complicate the calculation.",NEGATIVE,FTT,BLOCKCHAIN | EXCHANGE | MARKET | BNB | FTT,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/13/binance-huobi-block-ftt-deposits-after-420m-worth-of-tokens-illicitly-released,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/d16543e94117c00850a068d36e8a92f535ff52e8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42388669,1WhGe7o17bdD4QO5qRQJMH,1668319459,Huobi Asset Transparency Report Reveals $3.5B in Crypto Holdings,"Huobi Global, once China's top crypto exchange, published an asset transparency report on Sunday to reassure users that its funds remain safe.  As of Nov. 12, there were 191.84 million Huobi token, or HT, ($900 million) on the platform along with 9.7 billion TRX, 820 million USDT, 274,000 ETH and 32,000 BTC, and several other coins, including ATOM, ADA, BCH, DOGE, DOT, MATIC, SHIB and ETC.  The total estimated value of reserves was $3.5 billion, the report said.  Huobi said HT tokens are not only held by the Huobi Global, but some of them are also held by Huobi Global’s users.  The revelation came days after FTX, formerly the third largest digital assets exchange by volume, imploded in response to a CoinDesk report that showed the exchange's sister company Alameda Research's balance sheet, was primarily made up of FTX's native token, FTT.  Since then, crypto exchanges worldwide have been scrambling to publish so-called proof of reserves to assure users that their funds aren't being channeled into other investments. On Nov. 10, leading crypto exchange Binance released the list of its cold wallets and reserves, disclosing $69 billion in crypto reserve.  ""Huobi is acting now to disclose the balance details of our hot and cold wallets and make this disclosure a routine going forward,"" the exchange said in the report, adding that it performed a Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves audit early last month when the exchange's founder Leon Li sold his controller stake to About Capital.  Huobi promised to publish another Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves audit conducted by a third party within 30 days to boost user confidence further.  Under the Merkel Tree audit, an independent entity takes an anonymized snapshot of all crypto balances held by the exchange and aggregates them into a Merkel tree, a structure normally used to check the integrity of block data.  Huobi's disclosure, however, failed to calm market nerves. The HT token was recently trading at $4.8, down 8.9% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data.  The exchange reportedly saw an outflow of 10,000 ETH after it published the asset reserve report. Data from South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows a total of 12,000 ETH ($15.14 million) have left Huobi in the past six hours.  Huobi said the outflow was part of routine operations. ""The true situation is that the addresses we listed include some hot wallets; the on-chain deposits and withdrawals are part of the normal operation. The exchange is operating normally now,"" a spokesperson from Huobi's PR team told CoinDesk in an email.  The platform has the ""ability and strength to ensure the safety of users' assets and 100% payment, and there is not and will not be any restrictions on users' withdrawal,"" the spokesperson added.  12:45 UTC: Edits the DEK and the third para to say there were 191.84 millions of HT on the platform.

The Securities Commission of the Bahamas (SCB) published a statement on Twitter Saturday suggesting that a recent tweet by FTX admitting that Bahamian users were able to withdraw funds at the regulator's urging was inaccurate.  FTX said in a tweet ""per our Bahamian HQ's regulation and regulators, we have begun to facilitate withdrawals of Bahamian funds"" on Thursday.  SCB said it had not ""directed, authorized or suggested to FTX Digital Markets"" that it prioritize withdrawals for Bahamian users in its statement Saturday.  ""The Commission further notes that such transactions may be characterized as voidable preferences under the insolvency regime and consequently result in clawing back funds from Bahamian customers,"" it said. ""In any event, the Commission does not condone the preferential treatment of any investor or client of FTX Digital Markets Ltd. or otherwise.""  SCB froze FTX's assets in the Bahamas late Thursday, but the exchange had already halted withdrawals a few days before.  Despite this halt, some users were able to withdraw nearly $7 million worth of various cryptocurrencies within a few hours on Thursday morning, data from Nansen showed.  A number of FTX users based outside of the Bahamas also appeared to try and withdraw funds with the help of local users, CNBC reported. The foreign users bought high-valued NFTs from Bahamas-based users, presumably with an agreement that the Bahamas-based users would be able to withdraw and keep some amount of the locked-up funds.  FTX declared bankruptcy on Friday, days after a deal for Binance to acquire the exchange fell through.
