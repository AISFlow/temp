42397349,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfUs,1388332804,The Best Real-World Bitcoin Merchant Pioneers of This Year,"Amid all the excitement and speculation surrounding bitcoin's price over the last couple of months, it's important to remember: to be worth anything at all, bitcoin must be accepted by merchants and used by regular customers on a day-to-day basis.  Several online businesses accept bitcoin as a fast and simple, fee-free way to transact, but there have been a few more hurdles in introducing the currency to physical traders.  There are payment processor accounts to set up, landlords and suppliers who accept only fiat currencies, and the odd pieces of clunky point-of-sale software and hardware.  Sometimes, even the promise of no credit card or bank processing fees isn't enough to convince busy store owners to try a radical payment system still in its early experimental phase.  So, we are bringing you the real-world bitcoin pioneers: the store owners and charities who believed enough to try bitcoin out, the evangelists who went to extreme lengths and places to promote its usefulness, and the publicity stunts that caught the attention of the general public.  Thanks to their actions, at the end of 2013 'bitcoin' is now a familiar word in the cultural mainstream, even among those who know little of its merits.  Subway  This story trickled into prominence back in early November. There was no official announcement from the parent company and no indication that they ever approved of it, but people in various places around the world noticed some Subway sandwich outlets had started to accept bitcoin.  If true, it would be one of the first examples of a major brand to do so, even if only at a few independent franchises. It started in Moscow in August with an Instagram snap of a Subway outlet offering a 10% discount for people paying in bitcoin.  It was followed by a tweet (supposedly of the same store) in early November and in subsequent weeks by Subways in Bratislava, Slovakia and Allentown, Pennsylvania also joining the bitcoin party. There are also reports another subway in Brno, Czech Republic is now accepting bitcoin as well.  So far it seems to be just these four stores, but Subway's popularity and the attention they've received has led to a grassroots campaign by fans lobbying their own local stores to jump on board.  Virgin Galactic  Bitcoins, Richard Branson and ... space travel! There, you have everything you need to grab the headlines for a couple of days. In late November, Richard Branson became one of the highest-profile business owners to accept bitcoin through his company Virgin Galactic.  [post-quote]  Virgin Galactic promises to offer the first flights to suborbital space available to the general public, starting in 2014.  You can now spend your bitcoins on a rocket flight to space, and Branson said one passenger had already done so.  ""Bitcoins aren’t yet formally recognized by governments as a currency but with some regulation I hope that it will become more widely accepted.""  ""A few years ago many people had doubts about whether Virgin Galactic would ever get off the ground. Now we have gone supersonic, are a long way along the testing process, and are looking forward to launching commercial space travel,"" he wrote in a post on the Virgin blog.  ""Virgin Galactic is a bold entrepreneurial technology and is driving revolution – bitcoin is doing just the same,"" Branson announced on CNBC, admitting he also held bitcoins of his own.  Branson has a penchant for publicity stunts and accepting bitcoin is undoubtedly one of them. But the fact that bitcoin is now worthy of mainstream media attention for an already well-known business might be a story in itself.  Ride through Africa  Riders Borja and Elvis took on a task that would be daunting even with a suitcase full of US dollars: an epic motorcycle journey from Morocco to Cape Town, stopping in around 16 different African countries along the way.  The fact that they decided to fund the adventure at every stop by trading bitcoins with locals made the challenge even more impressive.  The duo were sponsored by LocalBitcoins, who have done much to bring bitcoin into the physical world by making face-to-face trading simple and accessible. The company also provides the most popular form of bitcoin trading in countries where bank transfers are difficult or impossible.  The couple converted their salaries to bitcoin when prices were much lower, and have traded their bitcoin for local currency at every stop.  So far, they've had problems with the bikes, seriously muddy roads, storms and intermittent internet access. They've stayed in cities and jungle huts, and learned a lot about Africa and its people along the way.  The biggest hassle they've encountered so far is having only bitcoins to offer as bribes to local officials along the way. Governments of all kinds, it seems, are addicted to fiat currency.  Having proved bitcoin's tradability even in places like: Burkina Faso, Mali, Senegal, Western Sahara and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Borja and Elvis have passed through Namibia in the continent's South West, and are now in the final stages of their tour.  They're recording their trip on the LocalBitcoins blog.  Life on bitcoin  There are plenty of things you can do with bitcoin but, let's face it, unless you were eating in certain cafes or buying everything with gift cards (or motorcycling through Africa), it was still tough to survive on bitcoin on a day-to-day basis in 2013.  Newlyweds Austin Craig and Beccy Bingham-Craig took a plunge bigger than most when they decided to live, and tour the world, exclusively on bitcoin.  Paying their fortunate landlord a 10% premium to accept bitcoin rent to make sure they had a home to return to, they headed off to three different continents to test how friendly the world really was outside bitcoin forums and discussion threads.  They raised over $70,000 on Kickstarter to document their journey on film and traveled between July and October, meeting with bitcoin enthusiasts at every stop and spreading the word to local businesses.  It wasn't easy, and the couple claimed to have spent less money in total thanks to limited spending opportunities.  They booked all their flights and accommodation through SimplyTravel, a German company which accepted bitcoin for its services.  Austin and Beccy are now back home in Utah, and say it's a relief to be able to use dollars again. While the bitcoin world salutes them for their efforts, it seems they were just slightly ahead of their time.  Sean's Outpost  Question: In 2013, what went from 50 in March to 900 in November? Answer: the number of meals served to homeless people per week by Sean's Outpost in Pensacola, Florida (also the value of bitcoin in US dollars, but that's another story).  The charity started accepting bitcoin on 17th March, and has been a constant source of good news since, becoming what is probably the world's most famous bitcoin charity.  It also has a new project called Satoshi Forest, a nine-acre live-in agricultural property for its clients designed to be fully self-sustaining in future.  For Christmas, Sean's Outpost organized a ""bitcoin angel tree"" with a list of gifts donors could purchase with bitcoin. The list of nearly 40 items was fully funded within three hours.  In another Christmas twist, Bloomberg's Matt Miller accidentally exposed a wallet private key in full HD on TV. The money (about $20 worth) was instantly 'stolen' by Reddit user milkywaymasta who, given permission to keep it, donated it to Sean's Outpost.  Bitcoin's philanthropic spirit remains almost as robust as its late-2013 market value.  Overstock.com  Overstock.com CEO Patrick Byrne took many by surprise in mid-December when he announced, almost casually, that the company would start accepting bitcoin as a payment option in 2014. Given Byrne's political leanings and opinions on fiat currencies, his company might be a good fit for bitcoin. Overstock.com (or O.co as it is becoming known) would be, however, the largest and most prominent company to introduce a digital currency option for all purchases.  Byrne said the company hasn't decided on a payment processor or thought about the tax implications much yet. Whatever challenges Overstock.com faces and/or overcomes, other merchants will be watching with interest.  Honorable musical mentions  Snoop Dogg  and Mel B roared back into headlines and social media feeds at the end of 2013 with promises to accept bitcoins for their music.  Snoop tweeted that his next release would be ""available in bitcoin and delivered in a drone"", while (the former Scary Spice) Melanie Brown took more definite steps, partnering with mining operation CloudHashing and payment processor BitPay. Mel put bitcoin front and center on her homepagehttp://www.melaniebrown.com/music/, where her record is now available.  The internet has historically been kind to celebrities who've embraced its new ways of doing business, so if the two continue with their interest in it, bitcoin could be set to revolutionize another industry.

42397335,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfH6,1388329300,Bitcoin Trading Platform Coinsetter Close to Raising Additional $1.5 Million,"New York-based Coinsetter, which has built a platform for high-speed bitcoin trading, is raising additional venture capital.  According to a Securities and Exchange (SEC) filing, the company is looking to raise a total of $1.5m.  Coinsetter CEO Jaron Lukasiewicz told CoinDesk that the company has already raised most of the funds.  “You can't see this from the filing, but we have commitments on the majority of the round. We are now in discussions with a few large investors on the remainder. These are mostly VC firms and very high net worth angels,” he said.  Numerous investors from the financial world are involved, according to Lukasiewicz. He said:  “There are a large number of successful people from the hedge fund and finance industry participating in this round. We may disclose more info after we close the round.”  Coinsetter has built a bitcoin trading platform that can execute orders in “milliseconds”, according to its website. It also plans to allow traders to open margin accounts.  The company also has plans to give investors the ability to earn interest on their bitcoin holdings.  Previous funding  Coinsetter has already raised a round of financing last April, getting $500,000 from a group of investors that included Barry Silbert of SecondMarket.  The Bitcoin Investment Trust, operated by SecondMarket, is a fund for accredited investors to get involved with BTC and has amassed over $60m in its first three months of operation.  Both SecondMarket and Coinsetter are attempting to improve bitcoin access for interested investors. A few other startups are also trying to do the same thing.  Vaurum is a company accelerated through Silicon Valley’s Boost VC incubator program. It’s building a platform that plugs into existing brokerages, providing a more mainstream passageway into the bitcoin market for investors.  Singapore-based itBit recently raised $3.25m to bring NASDAQ-based trading technology to bitcoin investors.  Additional personnel  Coinsetter’s Lukasiewicz says that his company is raising more capital because it needs to hire more technical personnel to build up its system.  “We have a huge near-term need to hire at least three Java developers in order to move at a quick pace in bringing important features to market,” he said.  “With a clear scope of what we want to build, this round will allow us to bring new, quality products to market at a fast pace while supporting our growing user base this year.”  Coinsetter is currently in a private beta. To request an invite, prospective users are being asked to submit their names and email addresses on the company’s website to be put on a waiting list for an invite code.

42397333,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAapfF8,1388314556,FinCEN: Bitcoin Miners Need Not Register as Money Transmitters,"Bitcoin miners who mine ""for themselves"" do not have to register as Money Services Businesses (MSBs) with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), according to an official letter from the agency this week.  FinCEN was replying to a request for clarification by Atlantic City Bitcoin (AC Bitcoin), aka advocate Milly Bitcoin, who maintains an array of ASIC miners in New Jersey. According to the letter, miners are still free to purchase goods or trade with exchanges with the bitcoins they produce whether operating as individuals or businesses.  The news should come as a relief for smaller-scale mining operations. Jerry Brito, senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, indicated that FinCEN wrote in a private letter last July that all miners would have to register as MSBs, and uncertainty had remained since then.  This could have put many individuals out of the mining business with its range of compliance regulations, such as having an auditor on staff. AC Bitcoin has been in regular contact with FinCEN in 2013 and pointed out that any necessity for miners to register as MSBs would require a public statement to that effect under the US Administrative Procedures Act.  AC Bitcoin said FinCEN's explanation was satisfactory enough for small miners at the moment, and showed FinCEN now had a greater understanding of bitcoin than in March, which was a positive sign.  The exact wording of the letter still leaves some room for interpretation, though, and its ramifications could hinge on words like ""disposing"" of bitcoin or ""transmitter"" of money in many cases. This could be deliberate to allow prosecution of individual cases at some later stage, but FinCEN's letter does clearly state it does not consider AC Bitcoin a ""money transmission service"" under its rules.  The letter stated:  ""In undertaking such a conversion transaction, the user is not acting as an exchanger, notwithstanding the fact that the user is accepting a real currency or another convertible virtual currency and transmitting Bitcoin, so long as the user is undertaking the transaction solely for the user’s own purposes and not as a business service performed for the benefit of another. A user’s conversion of Bitcoin into a real currency or another convertible virtual currency, therefore, does not in and of itself make the user a money transmitter.""  What is still not clear is how MSB or money transmission regulations will apply to larger operations or companies selling hosted mining contracts, like Cloud Hashing, Cointerra's TerraMine Hosting or Butterfly Labs' Hosted Mining. Users on reddit also engaged in debate over what it might mean for mining pools. Such groups generally distribute mined bitcoins amongst themselves but they vary in size and complexity of their arrangements.
