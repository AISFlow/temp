42424897,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuNh,1368741891,Bitcoin gaming site SatoshiDice closes to US players,"Citing legal advice, Bitcoin gaming site SatoshiDice is closing to US players, moving to block all US-based IP addresses from the website.  Posting on Bitcointalk and the Bitcoin reddit page, satoshidicepr, an official representative of the site who asked to remain anonymous, said the decision, which is effective as of today, was taken following “extensive legal counsel.”  “The best way to limit legal risk for SatoshiDice, and thereby protect its stakeholders, is to block US players,” the post states.  The company adds that the decision does not mean that online gambling is illegal in the US, nor does it mean that bitcoin gaming is illegal:  “However, the courts have not been clear on the definition of gambling, nor on what would constitute 'legitimate gaming,' nor are jurisdictions properly defined, and thus this is a proactive measure to protect those involved in the project.”  In an e-mail to CoinDesk, the SatoshiDice spokesperson added, “SatoshiDice is building a ubiquitous global brand in the bitcoin space, and must take the coercive threat of government seriously.”  An online post stated the decision to ban US players was not taken because of any citation or notice from any government agency, and is unrelated to the US Department of Homeland Security’s recent move to clamp down on Mt. Gox/Dwolla transactions:  “It is a proactive measure, based on the prudent legal guidance of our trusted lawyers. We believe this is a wise move for the site to perpetuate in the long term.”  Online gambling remains a grey area in the United States. There is no federal law against online gambling; however. online sports betting is illegal, and most online casinos are located in other countries because taking bets on a server located in the US is also illegal.  As CoinDesk reported earlier this week, in 2006, the US government began legal action against a number of online gaming companies, including London-listed BetOnSports. The company’s CEO, David Carruthers, was arrested in 2006; founder Gary Kaplan was also later arrested. Both men were sentenced to prison terms and the company was fined $28 million.  Describing itself as “the most popular Bitcoin betting game in the universe,” SatoshiDice allows players to bet on a roll of the dice using bitcoins. The company has processed over 4.6 million bets worth more than 3.6 million bitcoins (over $419 million, based on trading prices at press time). Because bitcoin transactions are private, the SatoshiDice spokesperson was unable to say how many of those bets were placed by US-based players.",NEGATIVE,없음,BTC | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Doug Watt,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/16/bitcoin-gaming-site-satoshidice-closes-to-us-players,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/dcf2a07e1e0d8fe18d41d0bac64efcf8430f960d-628x356.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Mashed together in two days, Crypto Track covers a variety of currencies, rather than just the increasingly popular bitcoin. It offers support for Litecoin, Namecoin, PPCoin, Terracoin and Novacoin. It displays the low, high and last prices for each on BTC-E. It also supports Mt. Gox pricing for bitcoins.  The service is limited thus far. No other exchanges seem to be supported, and there is no volume charting. It also supports only US dollar pricing. But Crypto Track's developer promises it will eventually support more exchanges.  What it does feature is the ability to input your total holdings for a currency, and the price at which you acquired it. It then tracks the overall gain value and percentage over time.

42424885,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWu1h,1368729247,"Too few bitcoin exchanges? Roll your own, says Bex.io","If you're worried about the centralization of bitcoin exchanges, you might soon be able to start your own for a couple hundred dollars.  Three Vancouver-based entrepreneurs are hoping to solve bitcoin’s exchange centralization problem with a cloud-based exchange service. Bex.io, they say, will let anyone create his or her own bitcoin exchange.  Started by bitcoin fan Jesse Heaslip -- along with programmers Ilya Khlopotov and Yurii Rashkovskii -- the service will charge customers a flat rate to launch their own bitcoin exchanges, and will also take a percentage of each transaction handled by each exchange. Bex.Io provides all of the back-end technology, including hosting and software, explains Heaslip.  Currently, bitcoin exchanges are highly centralized. Japan-based Mt. Gox handles roughly 80 percent of bitcoin transactions in US dollars, leaving a small and unpredictable market for independent bitcoin exchanges.  Earlier this year, a research study by computer scientists Tyler Moore and Nicholas Christin found that, of 40 bitcoin exchanges, 18 went out of business ... 13 of which closed without any warning. More exchanges have closed since that paper was written in January. And the recent Department of Homeland Security action against Mt. Gox makes the exchange business look even shakier.  “There's a big problem inside bitcoin in terms of trust and getting the last mile in and out,” says Heaslip. “If you have a localized version of (something like) Mt. Gox then you are able to build that trust locally.”  For example, Heaslip says, if he were going to buy bitcoins, he would want an exchange with offices and people based in Vancouver, so he could pay the company a visit if anything went wrong.  Bex.io's pricing is designed to reward high-volume sites, according to Heaslip. It is handled on a per-client basis, but works on a sliding scale ... so the more coins an exchange moves, the lower the pricing.  A professional account offers 24/7 customer support, and cross-exchange filling. This means that trading volumes can be supplemented with bitcoins from other exchanges in the event of a spike in demand.  Heaslip says Bex.io's strengths will include security and performance. The system will operate with datasets held completely in-memory, which will speed up transactions, he says. The system has also been written from the ground up in ERLANG, a language developed by Ericsson that targets distributed systems. It is also based on a NoSQL database, designed for high-concurrency, ""big data"" operations.  The company is paying extra attention to security, Heaslip adds, with plans for auditing by a third-party penetration tester. The concurrency element could also be a saving grace here. One of the biggest attack vectors for bitcoin exchanges is distributed denial of service (DDoS). Attackers like these because they can be used to manipulate values in the bitcoin markets, leading to quick profits. Bex.io will be distributed among several hosting companies worldwide to increase performance by managing transaction processing closer to the customer base. If done right, this distributed operation could also help to reduce denial of service issues, according to Heaslip.  But Bex.io’s biggest challenges could lie with regulation and customer reliability. Simply having someone host an exchange at a local address doesn't guarantee its survival, and the Moore/Cristin study shows how unreliable the decentralized market can be.  “Our goal is to be the technology back end,” Heaslip says, noting that “(e)very country has their own rules and regulations.”  Customer selection could prove to be an important part of maintaining an efficient, reliable ecosystem of exchanges, he adds: “We want to partner with people that have good, established credibility in countries.”  While the company is currently offering ""limited beta invites"" and is set to officially launch by the end of summer, Bex.io is already off to a good start. The company was born after Heaslip and his team were asked to develop a bespoke exchange for a client, and decided to make it a resalable service. It has ""close to six figures"" in funding from two customers who are eager to see the service flourish.  If this takes off, it will be interesting to see its impact on the exchange world. Using stats from Bitcoin Charts, the Moore/Christin study found that 25 percent of exchanges process -- on average -- fewer than 25 bitcoins each day, compared to Mt. Gox's 40,000 bitcoins daily. Bex.io's innovation could potentially change that dynamic.",POSITIVE,없음,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/16/too-few-bitcoin-exchanges-roll-your-own-says-bexio,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/5259412e922e415e5bed313f6839e2e1d63184db-960x960.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42424894,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuJh,1368698455,Peter Thiel & Founders Fund lead $2 Million funding round in BitPay,"Peter Thiel's Founders Fund is leading a group of investors into funding the merchant services firm BitPay.  BitPay, which offers corporate Bitcoin services, said it had not been looking for funding but the opportunity was too good to turn down.  BitPay founder and CEO Tony Gallippi said: ""We raised seed funding in January and February and still had some left so we weren't looking for money. They approached us, which was a nice surprise because we'd heard that they'd got as far as due diligence with another company in this space. We were really impressed with their experience and energy.""  Gallippi said BitPay would spend the money on hiring more staff and continuing to build the platform. He said any process involving lawyers takes time but it ""was not as painful as we feared.""  Asked about yesterday's action against Dwolla Gallippi said much of the coverage was wrong and once you looked at the actual warrant it was clear it was a very specific problem of non-compliance - ""the shell company was not licensed to do what it was doing.""  Apart from ex-PayPal boss Peter Thiel, the fund's advisers include Napster founder and Facebook adviser Sean Parker along with ex-Google and SpaceX staff.  The terms of the deal were not disclosed but all the existing seed shareholders used their pro rata rights to maintain their ownership percentage in BitPay.  The company was started in May 2011 by two graduates from Georgia Tech. Their aim is to make taking bitcoin payments as easy as credit card transactions for businesses. It takes a set fee of 0.99 per cent on automated transactions.  BitPay  claimed 1,900 new merchants signed up in April and it continues to sign up over 100 new customers every day. It is currently processing around $5m of Bitcoin transactions per month.  Joining Founders Fund is 'Mad Max' Keiser's Heisenberg Capital - a London-based fund focussed on Bitcoin investments.  BitPay also hired a key developer yesterday - see our earlier story.  The firm is still hiring - it is currently looking for two node.js developers.  CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan was one of the investors in BitPay's first seed round earlier this year which raised $510,000.  Others staying in from the previous round include prominent Bitcoin angel investors Jimmy Furland and Barry Silbert from SecondMarket and the Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.  Founders Fund was formed in 2005 by PayPal founder and CEO Peter Thiel along with PayPal's former CFO Ken Howery and former PayPal VP Luke Nosek.  The fund has over a billion dollars under management. The funds slogan - ""We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters."" - reflects its interest in big technological developments whether in biotechnology, energy, transport or AI.  Previous investments include Facebook, Pathway Genomics, SpaceX, Spotify and articificial intelligence company Vicarious Systems.

Jeff Garzik will be coding for the company, which will also allow him to develop software for the broader bitcoin community.  Garzik has worked at Red Hat, a developer of LINUX software, since 2002, serving as principal software engineer. He has also been a core bitcoin developer since the beginning, working on the Satoshi client, and is listed as one of seven such developers on bitcoin.org. He founded the site Bitcoin Watch, which provides real-time snapshots of bitcoin market data.  His full-time employment is a sign of Bitcoin’s growth, as few of the other core developers are paid for their bitcoin work.

42424902,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuTh,1368690931,Google's Gmail will soon let you email money,"Google's not launching its own currency (not yet, anyway), but it does plan to soon let people send each other money as easily as sending an email.  In fact, it's going to let people send each other money by sending emails. Over coming months, Google's Gmail users will find a ""$"" icon added to their email attachment options. When they click the symbol they can specify how much money they want to send to whom.  The service will at first be available in the US only, to users 18 years of age and older. Recipients do not have to have a Gmail account or Google Wallet.  For users whose bank accounts are linked to Google Wallet or who have an existing balance in their Google Wallet account, sending money will be fee-free, Google Wallet product manager Travis Green wrote in a blog post on Wednesday. Transactions involving credit or debit cards will incur a flat fee of 2.9 percent (with a $0.30 minimum).  ""Paying back your friends is now as simple as sending an email, whether you’re chipping in for lunch or reimbursing your roommate for your share of the rent,"" Green wrote.  Sending money in Gmail will be possible only from desktops, although mobile users can transfer funds using Google Wallet.

42424899,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyHWuRh,1368690053,Cointagion unveils 'no-touch' e-commerce for bitcoins,"New e-commerce site Cointagion is offering e-books for bitcoins -- and lets users buy books without even touching their computers.  Selling books for bitcoins isn't particularly significant. Online merchants who accept the digital currency -- and there are more of them every day -- already offer everything from consumer electronics to porn to coffee and cupcakes.  But where Cointagion is innovating is in the payment mechanism. While Amazon offers a one-click checkout process for buying books on its site, which makes Kindle purchases easy, what Cointagion offers is a ""no-touch"" solution.  Instead of asking customers to go through a multi-stage, form-filling process and pay in bitcoins at the end, Cointagion can generate custom addresses in real time, containing information about both the user and the product.  Cointagion’s founder, Chicago-based medical software programmer Conrad Barski, published a white paper ( PDF)http://www.cointagion.com/CointagionWhitepaper.pdf on the website explaining his approach to quick bitcoin payment processing, with minimal steps for e-commerce sites. He does it using QR codes.  Using QR codes to display bitcoin addresses is routine these days. Search engine WolframAlpha, for example, will automatically generate them for you. But Barski has adapted this to dynamic address generation for different products on a website.  He uses session information from the user's browser -- identifying information about the product-- and a dynamically generated bitcoin address, in what he calls a ""triple"". E-commerce sites can pre-generate triples for the user when they load a webpage, and represent them as product-specific QR codes alongside each product listed on the webpage. In that way, when you want to buy a product, you can simply scan the code with your mobile wallet.  It's simple, but could be significant for e-commerce companies that want to explore bitcoin. According to the Baymard Institute, an average of two out of every three shopping cart sessions are abandoned before an online customer completes a transaction.  Others offering downloadable media also offer relatively simple payment processes. For example, Steambits, which offers games for download in exchange for bitcoins, requires an email address, to which it sends game codes and download instructions. It then displays an alphanumeric bitcoin address to be pasted into a bitcoin wallet. It's relatively simple, but not as simple as Cointagion's approach.  While Cointagion’s choices are relatively limited at present, and are weighted toward technical books, the product quality is high. It has partnered with No Starch Press, a specialist publisher of technical books that is also distributed by publishing giant O'Reilly Media in the US.  What's more, Barski’s no-touch principle could be used anywhere. It will be most effective for digital goods that can be instantly downloaded. Anyone buying physical goods will still need to set up an account with a delivery address ... although after that's been done once, no-touch purchases would be possible.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | EXCHANGE | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,Danny Bradbury,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2013/05/16/cointagion-unveils-no-touch-e-commerce-for-bitcoins,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d6b6ec6cfda48e2c006776fa99cb74aa170a67f-772x468.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop
