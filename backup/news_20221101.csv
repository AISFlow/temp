Trading without the proper skills, such as market structures of the crypto market and implementing your strategy, is akin to exposing yourself to risk, which could cost you your life, but in this case, your trading portfolio. There is so much more involved in trading in the crypto space other than buying and selling based on the feeling that this is the best time to buy or sell an asset. Understanding the market is in phases or cycles gives the trader, investors, and institutions an advantage to trade with the necessary edge and the technical tools needed to produce a great return on investment (ROI) over time. Let&apos;s look at how most traders, investors, and institutions take advantage of 3 triangle patterns, especially in this bear market, to make profitable gains and stay ahead of the market and other traders.

3621692,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=508825,1667343620,Can Russia Circumvent EU Sanctions Through Cryptocurrency?,"Russia has seemingly turned to cryptocurrency since the West decided to &apos;punish&apos; the nation for its invasion of Ukraine. A list of sanctions had been imposed upon the country by the United States and the EU which worked to essentially cut Russia off from world traders. However, with the rise in popularity of crypto, it has provided a possible way for the country to evade these sanctions which would have otherwise stuck when fiat currencies were the only form of payment. Why Russia Could Turn To Cryptocurrency One thing that has drawn investors to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is the fact that they are decentralized. A decentralized currency is not controlled by an entity. Hence, sanctions do not apply to them regardless of how severe they are. This has made it attractive to those who want to evade detection by governments, or in this case, countries trying to circumvent sanctions. Related Reading: Why The Dogecoin And Meme Coin Rally May Not Be Over Just Yet Lately, Russia has been warming up to crypto as a way to foster trade around the sanctions. The most prominent of these have been the sanctions on Russian gas purchases, which breeds the possibility of the country accepting crypto as a form of payment for their oil and gas. By using a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Vladimir Putin could be able to completely evade these sanctions and the established banking system.

The crypto market&apos;s recent sideways price actions seem related to the upcoming macroeconomic events and their potential influence across global markets.

42415106,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXHHs,1667342371,Terra-Victim Invictus Capital Defaults on $1M TrueFi Loan,"Failed crypto hedge fund Invictus Capital failed to repay a loan from decentralized lending protocol TrueFi, according to TrueFi’s loan data dashboard.  The firm missed paying down its $1 million loan denominated in Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin, which was due to mature on Oct. 30. The debt was uncollateralized, meaning that Invictus did not pledge any assets against it, and secured the loan by its reputation and good financial standing at the time.  TrueFi warned investors in a Twitter post in early October that Invictus might fail to repay the loan. New World Holdings, Invictus’ Cayman Islands-based parent company, entered into voluntary liquidation after suffering a blow in the crypto rout initiated by the multibillion-dollar implosion of once-top blockchain project Terra. Invictus reportedly moved investor funds to Terra’s failed stablecoin UST and to crypto lender Celsius Network that went bankrupt in July.  TrueFi has not issued a “notice of default” to Invictus yet. Invictus borrowed $28.8 million and paid it back with interest on TrueFi through 2020 and 2021 before defaulting on its latest loan, according to TrueFi’s dashboard.  “Invictus’ default once again illustrates the fragility of trust-based uncollateralized lending,” Walter Teng, vice president of digital asset strategy at research group Fundstrat, told CoinDesk.  This is the second uncollateralized loan to default on TrueFi within a month following Korea-based Blockwater’s failure to repay its $3 million debt on the platform. Another decentralized lending protocol, Maple Finance, faced difficulties in June after Babel Finance, a crypto lending firm, became insolvent and defaulted on a $10 million loan. The default resulted in a $7.9 million loss to investors. Maple decided to tighten its lending standards, Bloomberg reported last month.  These defaults amid the ongoing shakeout among struggling crypto firms show the risks and challenges of incorporating unsecured lending – which is widespread in traditional markets – to decentralized finance in the young,volatile digital asset market.  CoinDesk sent inquiries to TrueFi and Alvarez & Marsal, New World Holding’s representative in the court-assisted liquidation, for comment.

Bitcoin slumped below the 20k psychological level, giving rise to tensions among investors in the market. However, the month ended with a massive price rally for some altcoins across the market. While bitcoin price slumped below 20k and later made a recovery, Memecoins hit milestone gains, with DOGE increasing by 25%. SHIB and others followed closely after DOGE. How Dogecoin And Other Memecoins Are Faring The price of DOGE has rallied upward after Elon Musk completed the Twitter acquisition.

November appears like a bull time for DOGE as it pumped above $0.15 after a 15% rise but now stands at $0.13. Dogecoin was one of many memecoins that experienced the bulls while others followed closely. In the last 24 hours, Shiba Inu has gained more than 8%.

42415096,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXGQo,1667341446,Gibraltar Will Focus on Stablecoins and DeFi Lending After Market Turmoil,"Gibraltar’s financial regulator is exploring whether it needs to further regulate stablecoins and decentralized finance (DeFi) lending after the recent collapses of Terra and crypto lenders like Celsius Network.  The Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (FSC) wants to bring decentralized finance lending and stablecoins into “sharp focus,” William Gracia, head of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and markets at the FSC said Tuesday during “Gibraltar Day,” an event in central London to celebrate the British overseas territory's progress of blockchain and DLT within its borders.  The price of the then-$18 billion algorithmic stablecoin terraUSD (UST) collapsed and caused the crypto market to melt down and lose billions of dollars in a month, which then triggered the fall of crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital. Meanwhile, lender Celsius Network and crypto brokerage Voyager Digital froze withdrawals and suffered severe losses.  These events got the attention of regulators around the world, with the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority saying it would consider the collapse of Terra in its planned stablecoins rules while European Union lawmakers added new stablecoin provisions to their Markets in Crypto Assets legislation.  “In order for it to be a long-term sustainable business industry for Gibraltar, consumer protection needs and the protection of the reputation of Gibraltar needs to be at the forefront of what we do that means applying higher standards and best industry practices to ensure the continued success story of the DLT framework,” Gracia said.  The British overseas territory already has its Financial Services (Distributed Ledger Technology Providers) Regulations 2020 and recently added a 10th guiding principle that crypto companies have to follow which focuses on maintaining market integrity. It also has a licensing regime for DLT which in the past has been accused of being tough for firms to receive.  “After some time of continuously punching above our weight I think we have earned a heavyweight title,” Gracia said, reflecting on the country’s crypto achievements.  Last December Gibraltar said it planned to integrate blockchain technology in its systems.

As of Oct. 31, the blockchain supports NFTs (through a standard Ripple calls XLS-20) after a vote approved rolling out the technology. The move comes after Ripple a year ago created a $250 million fund to explore NFT innovation on its XRPL blockchain.  David Schwartz, chief technology officer of Ripple Labs, told CoinDesk in an interview this week that the goal is to enable mass adoption of tokenization – representing ownership of real-world things through NFTs – by offering lower costs, higher speeds and improved security over existing blockchains. Ethereum is among the incumbents.  “You're going to see projects based on things like carbon credits and real estate ownership and all these different use cases,” he said in an interview. “Anything that you can own all or some of that is unique, that can be represented by an NFT.“  Ripple is entering the NFT space at a time when royalties for digital creators are in the spotlight. Prominent marketplaces including X2Y2, Magic Eden, and LooksRare have made royalties optional, which has attracted scorn from some.  Doing so can limit creators' ability to profit off of their work.

This final tranche allowed for the cancellation of $2.1 million in debt. In all, since mid-August Stronghold has returned about 26,200 miners to NYDIG in return for the extinguishment of $67.4 million in debt.  Bitcoin mining firms have been struggling to keep their balance sheets afloat amid soaring energy prices and a bear market that has seen bitcoin lose more than half its value since its peak last year. One of the largest hosting firms, Compute North, filed for bankruptcy in September, while miners Core Scientific (CORZ) and Argo Blockchain (ARBK) are both facing severe liquidity issues.  Stronghold also closed on a debt restructuring deal with WhiteHawk Finance, moving the weighted-average maturity to 36 months from 13 months, trimming monthly payments and adding $21 million in cash to the balance sheet.  The restructuring has also freed up room in Stronghold's facilities at a time when space for hosting mining rigs at an economical rate has been dramatically short in recent months across the U.S. In addition to the 26,200 miners returned to NYDIG, Stronghold has another 14,200 slots for miners available after it ended a deal with the German firm Northern Data (NB2X:GER).  As of Tuesday, Stronghold has currently liquidity of about $30 million, including $29 million in unrestricted cash and bitcoin.  ""We are executing on the strategy we outlined during our second-quarter earnings announcement in August – to rapidly delever our balance sheet and enhance liquidity, and we are actively pursuing acquisitions of bitcoin miners at attractive prices to take advantage of the current distressed market while continuing to manage liquidity carefully,"" said Stronghold CEO Greg Beard.

Technical Take  Money Supply Growth Is Falling, an Encouraging Sign for Fed Progress  By Glenn Williams Jr  Crypto observers hoping for a more dovish turn in monetary policy may look optimistically at a percentage decline in the M2 money supply growth from a year ago.

The reduced supply growth could be evidence that recent Federal Reserve measures are working.

42415100,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXGbQ,1667336166,Bankruptcy Judge Denies Celsius’ Motion to Pay Employees $3M in Retention Bonuses – At Least Temporarily,"A federal bankruptcy judge struck down Celsius Network’s plans to pay out nearly $3 million in retention bonuses to a select group of employees on Tuesday, citing the lack of transparency in the bankrupt crypto lender’s public filings.  In a motion filed on October 11, lawyers for Celsius asked Judge Martin Glenn, the judge overseeing Celsius’ bankruptcy proceedings, to approve the company’s “key employee retention plan” (KERP). The plan, which Celsius’ lawyers claimed was necessary to keep the company’s employees from jumping ship to other crypto platforms, would divide the approximately $3 million in requested funds into cash bonuses for 62 of the company’s current 274 employees.  In addition to preventing “brain drain” at Celsius (to which Celsius claims to have lost 102 employees since the beginning of the bankruptcy process), lawyers also argued the KERP plan was necessary to compensate employees who had been promised a payout in the company’s native CEL token – a practice that has been halted and is now being investigated by various state regulators.  During Tuesday’s three-hour hearing, the judge did not seem to take issue with the contents of the KERP itself (which has also been approved by the unsecured creditors’ committee), but was bewildered and irritated by a second motion filed by Celsius’ lawyers on Oct. 11 seeking to file most of the details of the KERP under seal, including the plan participants’ “job titles, job descriptions, supervisors, hiring personnel, corresponding salaries and proposed KERP award.”  “I’m telling you, I was shocked when I saw the redactions. I’ve never seen anyone try to redact everything. That’s not going to happen in this case,” Glenn said. “Everything is blacked out – you’ve got to be joking.”  The judge sided with representatives from the U.S. Trustee’s Office, who argued in their own motion to deny the KERP that the opaque nature of the plan meant creditors and other interested parties would not be able to determine the identities of the KERP participants – and whether they were, in fact, eligible for a roughly $50,000 payout.  U.S. Trustee Shara Cornell also pointed out to the court that Celsius paid international consulting firm Willis Towers Watson $225,000 to perform the KERP analysis.  “Without a sufficient public record, I’m not prepared to go forward,” Glenn said. “I want anyone looking at the record to be able to see that the proposed awards are reasonable in relation to the current salary ranges of different categories of people.”  “I do believe there’s a basis for approving a KERP in this case,” he said, “but it hasn’t been made out.”  All eyes on the independent examiner  Motions addressing the scope of the investigation into Celsius to be conducted by the recently appointed independent examiner – Shoba Pillay of law firm Jenner & Block – were also on the table during Tuesday’s hearing.  On Oct. 18, Pillay filed a motion requesting that Glenn agree to widen the scope of her investigation to account for concerns raised by hundreds of Celsius investors who have filed letters and motions with the court.  Pillay wrote in her motion that Celsius’ use of CEL tokens – particularly how and why other crypto assets were converted into CEL tokens and how they were marketed, stored and traded – was concerning for many of its unsecured creditors, as were “the representations [Celsius] generally made in public representations to customers to attract them to their platform.”  While several pro se creditors at the hearing urged the judge to approve Pillay’s motion to expand the scope of her investigation, a representative for the unsecured creditors committee (UCC) pushed back.  Gregory Pesce, an attorney from White & Case representing the UCC, told the judge that the subjects Pillay was proposing to investigate, including the potential misuse of CEL tokens, were already under investigation by dozens of state regulators.  “It’s really inappropriate, in our view, to have [unsecured creditors] subsidizing that work,” Pesce said.  Glenn, however, disagreed, arguing that allowing Pillay to spearhead the investigation into Celsius’ conduct – including whether or not it engaged in Ponzi-like behavior – was more efficient for all involved.  “For now, at least, we’re happy to allow the examiner to pursue this investigation. If she can’t, [Celsius] is going to wind up with subpoenas from 30, 40, 50 state regulators, the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] ... and the cost to the estate will be substantially higher.”  Several state regulators, including representatives from Texas, Vermont and Wisconsin told the judge they supported the motion to expand Pillay’s scope of investigation.  “Sometimes sunlight is the best disinfectant,” Layla Milligan, a representative of the Texas State Securities Board, told the court. “More information provided by a party that is not subjected to a constituency would be helpful to everyone.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/01/judge-denies-celsius-motion-to-pay-employees-3m-in-retention-bonuses-at-least-temporarily,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/444d082332486dde0f14efbcc67da1bcca5efa54-5000x3750.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413737,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBxw0,1667333782,MicroStrategy Reported Impairment Charge of $727K on Bitcoin Holdings in Q3,"MicroStrategy (MSTR) posted a minimal digital asset impairment charge of $727,000 on its bitcoin (BTC) holdings in the third quarter, down significantly from $917.8 million in the second quarter as the price of bitcoin remained relatively stable at the end of the second and third quarters, according to its latest earnings report.  The company's digital asset impairment reflects the decline in the price of bitcoin versus the price at which the bitcoin was acquired.

But if the price rises, that does not get reported unless an asset is sold.  In its earnings press release, MicroStrategy noted it was encouraged by the Financial Accounting Standards Board's recent support of the use of fair value accounting for bitcoin, which would allow companies to report losses and gains immediately, as they would other traditional financial assets. MicroStrategy's chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said in a statement he thought such a change would ""promote additional institutional adoption of bitcoin as an asset class.""  Executive Chairman Michael Saylor echoed Kang's optimism on MicroStrategy's conference call Wednesday, adding that bitcoin will benefit as more clarity and guidance is offered. ""It doesn't mean that we have enough guidance to change our accounting,"" Saylor said on the call, though when considering next steps, ""we know we have unanimous support to adopt fair value accounting for bitcoin,"" he added.  Additionally, Saylor and CEO Phong Le expressed optimism about the payments potential of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, and for MicroStrategy to bring value in this area.  Between Aug. 2 and Sept. 19, MicroStrategy bought 301 bitcoins for about $6 million, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The purchase brought MicroStrategy's total holdings of bitcoin to almost 130,000. At bitcoin’s current price of about $20,440, the value of those holdings is approximately $2.66 billion. MicroStrategy's entire market capitalization is roughly $2.9 billion.  While MicroStrategy’s large purchases of bitcoin in 2021 and early 2022 were funded via the issuance of secured notes and sales of its common stock, the company’s much more modest acquisitions of bitcoin in the second and third quarter of 2022 were made simply using excess cash, the company reported.  As of Sept. 30, 2022, the original cost basis and market value of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings were $3.983 billion and $2.532 billion, respectively, which reflects an average cost per bitcoin of approximately $30,639 and a market price per bitcoin of $19,480.51, the company reported.  Overall, MicroStrategy reported a third-quarter adjusted earnings loss of 96 cents a share versus analyst consensus estimate for a loss of 15 cents, on revenue of $125.4 million, short of estimates for $127.2 million.  Following the release of its results, MicroStrategy shares were rising about 2.3% to $263. Shares have tumbled around 51% year to date, slightly better than bitcoin’s roughly 56% drop over the same time period.  Michael Bellusci contributed reporting to this story.

Since the crash in June, Ethereum has developed significantly better than Bitcoin. A Bitcoin recovery towards the 200-MA has a good chance as sentiment remains very pessimistic and seasonality is favorable until year-end. Macro wise, the upcoming US congressional elections seem to provide a breather for all market sectors. A milder tone by the FED could boost all markets, including Bitcoin and crypto. In the big picture, the correction in the crypto sector could be significantly longer, especially in terms of time, though. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) as well as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and the whole crypto sector are in a bear market for nearly a year now. Overall, the selloff has been brutal and any recovery has been short-lived. However, in recent months the correction has slowed down, and Bitcoin continues to find support around 18,000 to 20,000 USD. Review Since crashing to 17,600 USD in mid-June 2022 Bitcoin prices have only slowly recovered. Although there was a weak bounce in August to around 25,200 USD, prices have mainly been moving sideways between 18,500 USD and 20,000 USD in recent months. If you want to report at least something positive, then it is probably the fact that Bitcoin, in contrast to stock and bond markets as well as the price of gold, has not marked a new low in the last four months. Instead, it has been able to hold above 18,200 USD since mid-June. Ethereum/Bitcoin-Ratio, weekly chart as of October 31st, 2022. (Tradingview) The fact that Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) has developed significantly better than Bitcoin since the crash in June is also interesting and positive. Although there is more than justified criticism of the Ethereum network and Bitcoin is still the only one that deserves the title ""decentralized"", the market seems to know more. Nevertheless, in terms of market capitalization, Ethereum still lags far behind Bitcoin. However, the Ethereum/Bitcoin-Ratio makes it clear that Ethereum, which unlike Bitcoin was not designed as a currency and store of value, but for complex smart contracts and decentralized applications, continues to tinker with the breakout against Bitcoin. In fact, due to technological advances, Ethereum now better represents the ""blockchain"" innovation. And although interest in cryptocurrencies has waned in recent months due to price weakness, Chainanalysis' Global Index shows that large and long-term crypto investors have held onto their positions. Technical analysis for Bitcoin in US-dollar Bitcoin Weekly Chart - Still within a clearly defined downtrend channel Bitcoin in USD, weekly chart as of October 31st, 2022. (Tradingview) In the big picture, Bitcoin is currently trading just below the mid-trend line of its large overriding uptrend channel. Despite the 11-month correction, this trend channel is still intact and would only have to be cast aside with prices below around 6,000 USD. Since November 2021, however, price action has also been taking place in a clearly defined downtrend channel. Here, Bitcoin is currently trading just above the mid-trend line as well. A recovery within the downtrend channel would currently have room to around 27,500 USD. Overall, the trend on the weekly chart is still pointing downwards, but the tough sideways phase of the last few months could initially be resolved with a counter-trend recovery or a bounce. The oversold stochastic oscillator would be ideally positioned for this. At the same time, one is well advised not to overestimate any recovery movements. It would be better to wait for evidence that the crypto winter is over, because below 18,000 USD there is still a risk of another price slide of around 30-50% looming. Bitcoin Daily Chart - Some chance for a recovery Bitcoin in USD, daily chart as of October 31st, 2022. (Tradingview) On the daily chart, the broad support zone between 18,000 and 20,000 USD has held for the past few weeks. Bitcoin bulls are currently trying to break out to the upside. A first attempt failed on Wednesday, but the upper Bollinger band (20,987 USD) has been bent upwards. This gradually creates more space to the upside. The first target of a recovery would be the rapidly falling 200-day moving average (24,569 USD) and would actually be overdue. As well, a rally towards the upper edge of the downtrend channel around 25,000 to 26,000 USD seems possible. However, the stochastic has already reached its overbought zone again. In this respect, it looks more like a tough challenge for the bulls to advance directly. A pullback towards crucial support around 20,000 USD before another rally attempt is therefore likely. In summary, the chance for a slightly larger recovery is on the chart. However, prices well above 25,000 USD currently appear rather unrealistic. Nevertheless, if the US dollar actually corrects a little more, Bitcoin and the crypto sector would get a boost. Sentiment Bitcoin - Fear has been the norm since the beginning of the year Crypto Fear & Greed Index, as of October 28th, 2022. (Lookintobitcoin) The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is currently sitting at 31 and continues to measure high levels of fear in the crypto sector. This has become the norm since the price collapse at the beginning of the year. Crypto Fear & Greed Index long term, as of October 28th, 2022. (Lookintobitcoin) In the big picture, however, the bombed-out sentiment also provides a contrarian opportunity. Seasonality Bitcoin - Strong 4th quarter Seasonality for bitcoin, as of October 28th, 2022. (Seasonax) Statistically, Bitcoin had a strong 4th quarter over the past 12 years. Of course, seasonal statistics cannot guarantee future price movements. Nevertheless, the probability of a recovery towards the end of the year is significantly higher from a seasonal perspective. Sound Money: Bitcoin vs. Gold Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio, weekly chart as of October 31st, 2022. (Tradingview) At current prices of around 20,500 USD for one Bitcoin and around 1,640 USD for one ounce of gold, you have to pay 12.5 ounces of gold for one Bitcoin. In other words, an ounce of gold ( XAUUSD:CUR ) currently costs 0.08 Bitcoin. Just like Bitcoin prices, the Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio has been running sideways for a good four and a half months. A recovery in favor of Bitcoin has not yet succeeded. The overarching trend is therefore pointing further south, and the Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio would have to rise above 14 at least to clearly and sustainably break the downtrend. In summary, the Bitcoin/Gold-Ratio remains in a downtrend, and continues to consolidate the last major slide in prices with a sideways chop. Macro Update - A breather until the congressional elections US Treasury 10-year bond, monthly chart as of October 31st, 2022. (Tradingview) The 10-year US Treasury bond ( UTEN ) yields rose further over the past four weeks, reaching 4.33% before falling back to 3.97% in the last few trading days. US Dollar Index as of October 27th, 2022. (Sentimenttrader) For the first time since the beginning of the year, the US Dollar also seems to be faltering, as the greenback fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time. Both, the constellation in the futures markets and the sentiment actually speak for a correction in the US Dollar. Federal Reserve Bank Operating Profit or Loss, as of October 28th, 2022. (ZeroHedge) At the same time, the significantly higher interest rates are costing the American central bank a lot of money, because the Fed has to pay over half a billion USD in interest to American and foreign banks every day. The Fed's operating loss rose to a record 6.3 billion USD last week! Overall, the two major stress factors in financial markets (rising interest rates and a strong US dollar) have calmed down somewhat recently. Signs of a major recovery in the stock markets immediately materialized, but so far this has not been very sustainable for other market sectors. Bitcoin was also able to shoot up to 21,000 USD for a short time. Nevertheless, the situation remains tense and the corrective movement in the US Dollar, which is actually overdue, has not yet been confirmed. However, a recovery around the US congressional elections on November 8th would be overdue in all sectors. It could even turn into a year-end rally. Due to the fragile overall situation, the FED could at least soften its tone a little in this week's FOMC announcement and thus further fuel a relief rally. Nevertheless, it is still far too early to call the end of the bear market in financial markets. Conclusion: Bitcoin - Some chance for a recovery At 20,500 USD, Bitcoin is currently trading around 70% below its all-time high. The last 11 months have been characterized by a brutal downturn, and so far there are no signs of a change in trend. On the contrary, in view of the desolate macro situation, the correction in the crypto sector could be significantly longer, especially in terms of time. Nevertheless, two months before year-end there is at least some chance for a (small) recovery towards around 25,000 USD. Hence, a new attack on the support at around 18,000 USD would not be expected until 2023.",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | ETH | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,,0,0,Seeking Alpha,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4551618-bitcoin-some-chance-for-recovery-technical-analysis?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/50/3617058.jpeg

Compute North, one of the largest bitcoin mining firms in the world, declared bankruptcy in late September, saying it can't fulfill debt obligations worth up to $500 million.  Generate Capital agreed in February to lend the hosting firm up to $300 million for the development of two sites, a 300 megawatt (MW) facility in Wolf Hollow, Texas, and a 100 MW one in Kearny, Nebraska, said Compute North's chief financial officer, Harold Coulby, in previous testimony. An entity called CN Pledgor LLC owns 100% of the Wolf Hollow and Kearney facilities through its total ownership of CN Borrower LLC , Coulby said.  According to purchase agreement, the lender was the only one to bid for CN Pledgor's equity of CN Borrower, and the court approved the sale.  Coulby claimed that, in July, Generate Capital ""asserted several technical events of default"" in order to take control of Compute North assets, triggering the miner's chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Fast forward to November, and Generate is fully buying out Compute North's sites for $5 million and is assuming several liabilities associated, including obligations to clients that host their machines at their sites, according to the agreement.  The process of connecting the Wolf Hollow plant to the Texas grid, managed by the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas, has not been completed, the agreement said.

42420885,ha93388BwWkPe8xtcWtZMr,1667332832,"Crypto Markets Analysis: Money Supply Growth Is Falling, an Encouraging Sign for Fed Progress","Crypto observers hoping for a more dovish turn in monetary policy may look optimistically at a percentage decline in the M2 money supply growth from a year ago.  The parabolic increase in U.S. money supply during 2020 is largely behind the current inflationary environment. The reduced supply growth could be evidence that recent Federal Reserve measures are working.  Bitcoin and ether were trading sideways on Tuesday, albeit slightly to the green, a day ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee’s latest interest rate decision.  Investors widely expect a fourth consecutive and robust 75 basis point hike, although they have become increasingly hopeful the Fed will increase the rate more modestly early next year or even in December amid signs the economy is not likely to head into a harsh recession.  Some traders speculate that Fed officials on Wednesday might signal they have made enough progress in their campaign to bring down inflation that they could downshift the pace of rate increases as soon as December.  However, JOLTs (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) data, showed an unexpected increase in job openings in September. Excessive unfilled job openings can often have an inflationary impact because organizations increase wages to attract candidates.  In early October, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said that it would be appropriate to pause the lending rate that the central bank charges other banks at slightly more than 4.5% by March 2023. The Fed is expected to increase the rate to 3.75%-4.0% on Wednesday. At the start of the year, the rate was 0.25%.  Bitcoin has slowed its pace of acceleration ahead of the rate decision. Its price has settled just above the psychologically important $20,000 mark, after last week’s 8% increase.  Prices have declined the past two days, but reduced volume and a compressed trading range signal reluctance more than it does a bearish shift.  A similar pattern is in place for ETH, although the second-largest cryptocurrency by market value traded slightly higher on Tuesday. ETH, now trading above $1,500, has largely outperformed BTC recently, with the ETH/BTC currency pair rising 14% since Oct. 20.  On-chain data shows an increase in the BTC mining hashrate, which bears monitoring if BTC’s price contracts. The hashrate refers to the amount of computing power required to process bitcoin transactions, so higher rates in conjunction with lower prices lead to compressed margins for bitcoin miners. As those margins contract, miners may have to sell BTC to stay afloat.  Currently, the BTC balance for miners has started to increase, which should be a positive sign.  Funding rates within perpetual futures contracts should also be monitored because they can indicate overall investor sentiment. Bullishness appears to be increasing, as funding rates were positive for October, with the exception of four days.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | DOGE | MARKET | MINING | TRADING,Glenn Williams Jr.,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/01/crypto-markets-analysis-money-supply-growth-is-falling-in-encouraging-sign-for-fed-progress,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/8b4bf5973e2c8936bdc4df3910d6cefbf89fa39b-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to the news article, a 29-year-old man identified as ""Nicolai Arcadie Muchgian"" was dragged by water currents close to Condado Beach. Beach patrols managed to retrieve his body from the ocean but there were no vital signs. The area is known for its dangerous strong oceancurrents that have caused several fatalities, according to the paper. (CoinDesk obtained a copy of a press release from the Puerto Rico Police Department consistent with the details reported by El Nuevo Dia.)  Mushegian contributed to the development of multiple blockchain projects and was heralded as a prolific architect of blockchain-based decentralized financial platforms and stablecoin systems.  Most notably, he was MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen's original technical partner on the project and worked on the protocol and its decentralized stablecoin DAI between 2015 and 2018, according to his personal website. He was not involved in the protocol's development lately, a MakerDAO contributor told CoinDesk.  He also co-founded the automated market maker Balancer and Reflexer's RAI, which is an ether-backed stablecoin and a fork of DAI.  Most recently, he was working on a crypto project called Rico, a free-floating decentralized stablecoin system that aimed to be the ""spiritual successor of DAI"" and designed in a way that DAI was originally intended ""without compromises.""  ""Nikolai was one of the only people in the early days of Ethereum and smart contracts who was able to predict the possibility of smart contract hacks and invented the security-oriented approach to smart contract design we know today,"" Christensen tweeted Monday. ""Maker would have been toast without him.""  MakerDAO declined to provide comment ""out of respect for Nikolai and his family,"" a spokesperson of the team said in an email.

42413752,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlByAy,1667327193,Uniswap Surpasses Bitcoin as Fed Rate Hike Decision Nears,"Dogecoin isn’t the only alternative coin outshining bitcoin. Decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap’s UNI token was recently up 5.1% over the past 24 hours and has risen more than 10% during the past week despite mixed news highlighting its expansion but also its alleged popularity among scammers.  UNI also rose more than 16% in October. Its surge coincides with a more dramatic late-October spike by DOGE, which was recently trading over 13 cents, a more than 10% gain from Monday, same time, and its highest point since late April. The popular meme coin rose more than 100% in October, most of the increase occurring in the last week of the month as billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk neared completion of his purchase of Twitter.  Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, spent a second consecutive day trading sideways, albeit tinted more green than red. BTC was holding comfortably over $20,000, its most recent support line, while ether continued to hover over $1,500, where it climbed last week.  Riyad Carey, research analyst at crypto data firm Kaiko, tied UNI’s rise to a $165 million Series B funding round led by Polychain Capital that Uniswap announced Oct. 13. CoinDesk also reported last month that UNI would soon be deployed on privacy-focused layer 2 tool zkSync following the completion of a governance vote. The firm said the zkSync ecosystem has more than 100 projects committed to launching on its main network, including top decentralized-finance (DeFi) platforms, infrastructure products and on/off ramps.  Uniswap has “a very high market share of volume,” which is ""benefitting disproportionately compared to other DEX tokens,"" said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at crypto data and analysis firm IntoTheBlock.  But Twitter has been buzzing over the past two days about a Jan. 20 report that 97.7% of tokens launched on Uniswap were rug pulls – meaning the developer attracts investors to a new cryptocurrency project but then pulls out before the project is built.  Crypto investors will be scrutinizing the Federal Open Market Committee’s latest interest rate decision on Wednesday, with expectations running high for a fourth consecutive 75 basis point hike. They have become more optimistic over the past week the U.S. central bank will tamp down its hawkishness early next year – or even before – amid faint signs that the economy may not be headed into a steep recession, although a number of major investment banks have diverged from this view.  In a note on Telegram, digital asset fund QCP Capital noted “markets shifting expectations towards a dovish outcome at the upcoming meeting,” but also its concerns “about a negative market reaction to persistent hawkishness from the Fed.”  Kaiko’s Carey said that Fed silence on interest rate retrenchment “could be a roadblock in the ongoing rally” for BTC.",NEUTRAL,BTC | UNI,BTC | BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | UNI,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/01/uniswap-surpasses-bitcoin-as-fed-rate-hike-decision-nears,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/2a5b85787381f192800b0cb3d8e9e442bd87f7de-1122x582.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394116,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXlxb,1667323897,The Web3 Twitter Fixes Elon Musk Could Actually Try,"Elon Musk is now “Chief Twit” after taking Twitter private last week, and the transition period seems as wracked with uncertainty as the months-long buyout negotiations. Musk, who is also CEO of Tesla and of SpaceX, has brought on a number of advisers with familiar faces in the crypto industry as he looks to revamp the social media platform and turn it profitable.  Although the world’s richest man didn’t mention crypto among the reasons for doling out $44 billion to take Twitter off the public markets, there are real indications that Twitter is edging towards Web3.  This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Binance helped finance the buyout and the crypto exchange’s CEO, Changpeng Zhao, is stepping up as an adviser. That’s alongside Andreessen Horowitz general partner Sriram Krishnan, a known crypto enthusiast, and member of the PayPal mafia David Sacks, who isn’t allergic to bitcoin either.  Musk's buyout is ""a chance to take a prestigious Web2 platform and use it as a sandbox to start taking apart some of the challenges that we've seen become synthetical in the Web2 space,"" Binance Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann said on CoinDesk TV. He told the tech blog Protocol the buyout is a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.""  Testing crypto at such a commercial scale would reveal much about the benefits and limitations of blockchain tech. Musk is apparently taking former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s advice to heart and mulling the idea of open-sourcing Twitter’s code.  But what exactly would a crypto-fied Twitter look like? Right now, the biggest effect Musk’s takeover has had on crypto has been to send dogecoin skywards. Even Zhao’s comments on “bringing social media and Web3 together” were geared towards “broaden[ing] the use and adoption of crypto.”  See more: Elon Musk Tweet Sparks Flurry of Twitter-Themed Dogecoin Tokens  Twitter – which is consistently unprofitable, wrecked by scammers and facilitates the spread of fake news – surely could trial crypto solutions. Here are the most likely:  NFT verification  One of Musk’s earliest proposals was to turn its “blue check” verification system into a paid product. Users, if they want to continue being verified, would pay upwards of $20 a month to keep their checkmarks. Bloomberg noted that, with 424,000 verified accounts, Twitter could see an additional $102 million in revenue (if all subscribe).  The idea has been roundly mocked by journalists, who’ve noted that verification isn’t a status symbol people should pay for but a tool for public safety. Account verification helps mitigate the spread of misinformation and the chance that someone would fall for a scam run by a fake account impersonating people like Elon Musk.  An alternative here is to open verification to anyone, but use non-fungible tokens (NFT) to create tiers of accounts. Non-fungible tokens, being immutable, have the benefit of cutting down on fake users, adding a layer of authenticity to bolster security. The vain among us could pay for some super-expressive, feature-granting token, while Twitter could continue giving out badges to public figures.  This is already happening, to some extent, with Twitter’s existing NFT strategy. The company could pull a Reddit and refer to tokens as something else, given how tarnished the term NFT has become due to bros on Twitter. In time, assuming Web3 takes off, NFT identities could be interoperable between sites. That means if you’re verified on Twitter, you would be verified wherever.  Ads  Decentralized identity unlocks a lot of potential across the web, including in advertisements. As unserious as “Chief Twit” seems, Musk is looking to bolster Twitter’s ad business (which currently accounts for just under 90% of its revenue). Decentralized identities, whether NFT-based or otherwise, could help advertisers target the “highly relevant” form of ads Musk wants while preserving user’s autonomy over their data.  Last week, Lit Protocol’s David Sneider wrote about the process for CoinDesk, noting that most websites today use “conversions” to determine revenue. Essentially, Twitter has software that knows when users click on an ad, as well as software that follows them from page to page and knows when they purchase something. That “last-click” attribution earns Twitter more money.  A more ethical model would allow for users to opt out, know how their data is being used and manage it themselves. Using verifiable credentials, advertisers and Twitter could still track click-through rates, but would need to ask for permission to decrypt any information a user requires. This might cut down on bulk ad revenue but may make users more attractive to advertisers.  Payments  Fortune crypto editor Jeff John Roberts wrote Monday that if Musk had a strategy while buying Twitter it was likely to turn it into a payments company. Musk told the New York Times the company will bring in $1.2 billion in payment revenue by 2028. This would happen by turning Twitter into a sort of open-source WeChat, an “everything” app in China.  Payments on Twitter make sense – especially if you need to transact with someone you only interact with while on the app. Before stepping down, Dorsey already paved the way for this by introducing Bitcoin Lightning (though tradition fiat payments work, too).  Roberts theorized Twitter’s crypto payments platform could look a little like Facebook’s failed Libra project (with more success, one hopes). Libra also wanted to combine the network effects of social media with a currency independent of government management.  Bitcoin balance sheet  Musk already purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin at Tesla and could put it on Twitter’s balance sheet, too. This would be for all the same reasons as before: portfolio diversification. Although MicroStrategy, the ur-company to have bought bitcoin as an inflation hedge, is underwater with its BTC holdings, Tesla has profited.  Payments  Finally, Musk is considering reviving Vine, the short-form video platform that Twitter mothballed years ago. At least part of the reason Vine failed was because its biggest creators started to demand payment for their work. Crypto micropayments experiments have yet to take off, but the idea is sound enough: Reward people for posting on or interacting with your platform.  Although not everyone is into the idea of financializing every aspect of social media, it could be tried as an opt-in feature across Twitter or Vine. Maybe at first the program would be subsidized, and in time switch to a proof-of-stake system that rewards token holders.

42413749,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlByCq,1667321970,"Dollar Reversal Could Bring Inflationary Pressure, Former US Treasury Secretary Larry Summers Warns","This year’s strength of the dollar has been a key factor in keeping elevated U.S. inflation from rising even faster. Federal Reserve officials, meeting behind closed doors this week in Washington, D.C., have been far more focused on why consumer prices are rising than forces that might mitigate the pain.  But if global currency markets were to turn, Fed officials might get a rude awakening because a falling dollar puts a new and unwelcome source of upward pressure on inflation. The foreign-exchange factor could also represent a new threat to prices for risky assets, from stocks to bitcoin.  Because of the strong dollar, U.S. imports have become cheaper, in turn benefiting U.S. consumers. And that’s a big deal, because the U.S. is by far the biggest importer in the world, with a trade deficit of $67.4 billion in August alone.  A government-produced index of U.S. import prices (excluding food and fuel) has fallen by 1.8% since April – even with the main inflation rate close to a four-decade high, currently above 8%. Industrial supplies, building materials and non-electrical machinery all got cheaper to import in September, according to the Labor Department.  So it stands to reason that if other currencies were to start rising against the dollar, imports would suddenly become a lot more expensive for U.S. consumers. The result would be a new inflationary pressure that the Fed has not had to contend with for most of this year.  “If the dollar weakens, that will be inflationary,” former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers told CoinDesk.  What it means for the Fed, bitcoin  One question is whether such a development might, to some extent, limit the Federal Reserve’s ability to pivot toward a more dovish monetary policy – a possibility that some central bankers have hinted at in recent weeks.  It matters for the bitcoin (BTC) market because bitcoin has proven to be inversely correlated with the dollar, and also hit hard by tighter Fed monetary policy. The largest cryptocurrency is down 58% this year, while the U.S. Dollar Index has climbed 16%.  If a Fed pivot toward a softer stance were to result in a weaker dollar, and that in turn led to inflationary pressures, then the U.S. central bank might have to keep interest rates higher for longer – potentially an overhang for the bitcoin market.  Other countries, including major Group of Seven economies, have already been experiencing the reverse side of their own weaker currencies. Inflation in the European Union just hit a fresh high of 10.7% in October as energy prices surged 41.9% from a year ago; it goes without saying that many crucial commodities like oil are priced in U.S. dollars.  Signals from traditional markets suggest that a Fed softening might be in the offing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note is poised to fall below that of the three-year note – sometimes an indication that a recession is coming. If slower economic activity were to cause the Fed to cut interest rates, to soften the landing and minimize job losses, the dollar would ostensibly become less attractive – since yields would likely drop, and global investors would have less incentive to buy U.S. fixed-income investments; demand for greenbacks would fall.  Prospects for a pivot  According to at least one prominent economist, an expected rate increase next month by the Fed could be its last for a while.  “We see a decent chance that core inflation and wage growth will slow at the same time, more or less, making it much more likely that the Fed’s final hike will be in December,” Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note on Sunday.  Markets still see the federal funds rate peaking at 4.9% in the summer of next year, up from about 3% now. And based on the latest projections of Fed officials, the main interest rate could rise to 4.6% by the end of next year.  So the dollar might continue to enjoy tailwinds for a while.  But if not, the Fed might discover once again that, in the current economic environment, when one inflationary pressure subsides, another one suddenly arrives.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/01/larry-summers-warns-dollar-reversal-could-bring-inflationary-pressure-posing-challenge-for-fed-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b584344e7c4288e41422440f77bc6d6d1ebb0cd0-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42394172,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXtor,1667321011,The Metaverse Isn't Real,"A few weeks ago, I went down to Miami to speak to hundreds of marketing professionals at Adweek’s annual Brandweek summit. They planned a day dedicated to Web3 and the metaverse, the latter of which still seems to confuse many. What follows are the key tenets of the presentation I gave surrounding a single, challenging provocation: The metaverse isn't real.  Before diving into the meaty stuff, first let’s address this statement. Of course, “the metaverse isn’t real” is clearly a play on words. The metaverse exists in digital space, not physical space. It is always changing and, with a few lines of malicious code, can disappear for minutes or days.  Sam Ewen is the head of CoinDesk Studios.  But it also isn’t real in another sense. The hype surrounding the metaverse is betting on a future immersive and experience-rich virtual world infrastructure that does not yet exist.  While it’s great fodder for press releases and investment rounds, the metaverse as it exists today isn’t yet useful for the billions of users we are being told will join it. It is simply too early to tell how it will truly roll out. As we will discuss here, there are many competing factors in play.  One final point to mention before we dive in is that I exclude Roblox, Fortnite and other gaming systems from true metaverse consideration, as most of these platforms are centrally owned and have often resisted the Web3 call. They are certainly more robust and populated than most so-called metaverse platforms, but I believe they are just advanced video games and are antithetical to decentralized open systems. The metaverse I am speaking of is an immersive or augmented alternate reality experience that is primarily built upon a blockchain tech stack.  First off, what are the principles of a Web3 metaverse?  It is persistent and decentralized. No one entity can turn off the blockchain. Users can log in on their own time and ideally from a platform device of their choice.  It has a self-sovereign identity/asset layer. Whom we show up as and what we bring in is ours. Data is owned by the user.  There is community alignment. Participants are free to build, create and connect with each other as well as monetize their efforts and assets.  Currency is interoperable. Earn/spend mechanics are not a closed loop. Outside assets can be exchanged for in-world economic tokens and earned tokens can be converted back into IRL spendable tokens.  The metaverse is the next step in the evolution of (human) network technology  Just as Moore’s law predicted technological evolution that has enhanced how computers work and connect with each other, we have seen the parallel evolution of how humans do the same. Technological advancement has let us synchronously connect to a wider and more diverse set of people, with the barriers of geography, demographic similarity and differences in our cultural systems falling away.  Matthew Ball recently wrote in Time magazine that we are entering the fourth major era of computing. According to Ball, these eras are:  Mainframes (1950s-1970s)  Personal computing (1970s-present)  Mobile and cloud (mid 2000s - present)  Metaverse (2020s - ?)  If we believe in this, then we are just beginning our journey. The metaverse that many seem to think is just around the corner is the Spielbergian Ready Player One version. A fully immersive, almost photorealistic fantasy world where you can be a superheroic player, have access to endless information, feel real-time haptic response and benefit from fully functioning economies. While there are notes of this in some current projects, we do not yet have the bandwidth, real-time processing power or home hardware to truly bring this vision to life. Today’s streaming infrastructure allows for connected low-to-mid resolution game dynamics, canned animations, basic messaging and slight geo-location awareness.  The current state of the metaverse  Today there is a tremendous amount of experimentation going on within the metaverse space, with a wide variety of approaches. But, again, we must resist the hype that founders, venture capitalists, brands and others are espousing and be realistic about the state of what is actually possible today while keeping an eye out for what will be tomorrow. Anyone who spent significant time in CyberTown or SecondLife knows how the aspiration of what a virtual world can be does not always match the reality of how it actually is. Yet, if we believe the stats (some are predicting the metaverse market cap to be almost $1 trillion by 2030) and the premise that the metaverse is the next wave of technological innovation, then Web2 brands and Web3 builders need to be prepared to jump in and start strategizing.  As such, I thought it would be beneficial to pen these five takeaways for anyone looking to explore:  1. Prepare to take action and have a flexible approach for the future  Forward-thinking brands are learning, experimenting and generating strategies and approaches for multiple use cases right now, from creating owned and operated worlds to plugging into future community-owned microverses. While many brands are doing the hard work to learn and try, others are releasing projects just for attention and to seem “innovative.” Yet the metaverse isn’t necessarily a fad. Don’t build for a press release, build for a three-to-30 year seismic shift in human connection.  2. Stop focusing on selling and start focusing on feeling  Brands building in Roblox right now are mainly creating gamified commerce experiences. We are imprinting shopping behaviors on people from every angle and to a younger demographic. Is that the best we can do with an immersive, data- and graphic-rich experience? In the same way that Apple stores feel like life upgrade opportunities compared with Best Buy’s transactional focus on product showcase, emotion-based experiential design thinking will lead to brand success in the long run.  3. Community, empathy and connectivity will drive the metaverse more than commerce  Let’s not forget that the most successful modern tech brands in the world built themselves on making it easier for people to connect with each other. From Facebook to TikTok, what lies at the heart of these brands is chat, comments, self-expression and community (sprinkled with some anger and rage). The metaverse allows access to supportive communities across various subgroups based on passion and more importantly, empathy. If we look at the metaverse as immersive social media instead of gaming, we may design experiences with more kinship in mind.  There are endless stories of people who live in small towns or countries where their sexual orientation, musical tastes, fashion style, neurodivergence and other traits get them bullied, shunned or worse. But going into virtual spaces has opened up connections between like-minded people who not only support but celebrate each other’s diversity. It is a tool for people to find their people. It may be hard for brands and corporations to naturally insert themselves here, but the ones who can do so authentically can truly find a loyal community base.  4. Digital identity is fluid and ever changing  Instagram and TikTok reward sameness. From the angry chef who critiques recipe videos to the scores of teens making viral dance videos, neither the algorithms nor the fans like it when creators change their style or trends. But identity in the metaverse is designed around a certain fluidity, the ability to connect a wallet and change from one avatar to another with ease. With many active wallets holding dozens of non-fungible tokens and metaverse projects actively working with PFP collections to import them to in-world playable characters, we should prepare ourselves for a future where we change how we represent ourselves in the metaverse as often as we change our moods.  5. Contextual mixed reality metaverses may outpace purely digital metaverses  The digital twin market is expected to grow from $6.9 billion in 2022 to $73.5 billion by 2027. Just as Google and Apple have mapped the routes and topography of the world, there are many large and small companies that are using lidar and other scanning technologies to capture and collate the 3D information of the world around us. This has the potential to become the next large creative landscape – the overlay of art, data, social connection, search and commerce, applied as an information layer on the actual world around us through the use of mixed reality hardware and software. The biggest explosion of the metaverse, especially in non-gaming activities, may actually be in real-world locative data showing us everything from available tables at local restaurants to artist skins on the bridges, buildings and skyline around us.  In summary, there is a tremendous amount of hype surrounding the metaverse – what it is today and what it has the potential to become. Soon, there could be a seismic shift in how people spend their time in digitally enhanced worlds that could enable a whole new paradigm of borderless connection. With an eye to the future instead of rushing into today’s hype cycle, taking a long-term metaverse approach will pay off in the end.",NEUTRAL,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | MINING | SPONSORED,Sam Ewen,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/01/the-metaverse-isnt-real,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b7ef2748628cb280191cef65106e3801aaf7af5c-3840x2160.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The filings come less than three months after the firm announced a $300 million venture capital fund, a notably short turnaround time during a bear market.  The new CoinFund Seed IV fund is split into three parts – two domiciled in the Cayman Islands and one in Delaware, which is typically done for legal and tax purposes. The Caymans funds are targeting to raise $130 million and $20 million, respectively, while the Delaware fund seeks to raise $100 million. The first sales have yet to occur, meaning the funds hadn’t opened to investors.  CoinFund didn't respond to a request for comment by publication time.  In August, the firm launched the $300 million CoinFund Ventures I fund to invest in crypto companies gaining commercial traction in a sector with a large total addressable market, David Pakman, CoinFund managing partner and venture investing head, told CoinDesk at the time.  Founded in 2015, CoinFund originally focused on bitcoin (BTC) and seed-stage investments in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects before branching out.

42413748,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlByA2,1667318844,How Artists Can Raise Money for Social Causes With NFTs,"A common thread that ties the artist community together is the willingness to give back. The same is true for many creators of non-fungible token (NFT) projects, such as Beeple, whose work reportedly raised $6 million for the OpenEarth Foundation, and artist-led NFT communities like CowgirlDAO, which reportedly donated more than $70,000 for abortion access organizations this year.  Web3 is unlocking a new set of tools that enable artists to build compounding online support around shared values. “We raised $30,000 in minutes,” said CowgirlDAO founder Molly Dickson of her inaugural NFT drop Computer Cowgirls. That kind of immediacy, said Dickson, would not have been possible “if I was just shilling prints to my friends and family to raise money.”  Dickson launched a second NFT collection earlier this year in response to a leak from the U.S. Supreme Court indicating that Roe v. Wade, the landmark ruling that recognized the right to abortion, would likely be overturned. The collection earned some $44,000 for Fund Texas Choice, a nonprofit organization that covers travel accommodations for out-of-state abortions. Revenue from secondary sales continues to grow.  If you’re a creator interested in raising funds for social causes through an NFT project, here are some tips from those who’ve successfully raised money with their art.  Getting started  According to those who have navigated NFT fundraising efforts, the first step to a successful launch is coming up with your concept. Current events, social justice issues and personal connections may serve as inspiration for your collection.  “My focus is always on using art as a tool for storytelling – especially BIPOC stories – about women's rights and girls' education,” said Maliha Abidi, artist and founder of Women Rise NFTs. “That's what I will continue to do no matter what space I enter.”  Women Rise, a profile picture (PFP) NFT collection featuring colorful artwork, highlights diversity among women globally. The project donated approximately $120,000 to organizations supporting girls' education, including the Malala Fund founded by Nobel laureate and education advocate Malala Yousafzai.  Industry experts add that it’s important to consider practical questions too, such as whether you want your collection to be PFP-focused like Women Rise, one-of-one artwork or an entirely unique execution. For example, each NFT in the Computer Cowgirls collection was assembled by Dickson individually rather than by using a computer algorithm.  Launching the project  After the artwork is created, generating buzz in your community is key to raising awareness. While marketing tactics are important, both Dickson and Abidi were able to tap their existing followers’ goodwill without hiring a public relations firm for the initial drop. Instead, they released their projects on the popular NFT platform OpenSea and spread the word via Twitter, Instagram and other social media platforms.  “We try to put the project out there and represent ourselves however we can,” said Abidi. “We're very focused on making sure that we have a social media presence.”  It is often a good idea to inspire your followers with a mission-driven narrative before inviting collaboration around a “road map” – a popular term within the Web3 space for building a long-term strategic plan.  “We’re reaching out constantly, connecting with other businesses and looking for bonds to build in this community and space,” Abidi said.  New branches of activism can be created from newly-formed relationships. For instance, Dickson’s community of buyers evolved into CowgirlDAO, which now works together to vote on profit allocation and establish necessary legal payment rails for donating crypto. This organic development helped propel CowgirlDAO forward as a fundraising community, eventually with more formal structures.  Attracting donors  Some charitable NFT projects offer special perks for holders referred to as utility, which can come in the form of private Discord channels, live events and virtual meetups for community members.  NFT holders may find satisfaction in knowing they are making a positive impact. Community meetups, whether virtual or in person, can also be a meaningful way to connect supporters around a shared mission.  Owning a coveted piece of art can also be a motivating factor for seasoned collectors, particularly if a project has embedded rarity traits into the collection.  Experts we spoke with encourage socially minded collectors to find a project they trust that is linked to a cause about which they are passionate. Dickson explains that both donors and project founders can learn and adapt as the creation, minting and fundraising process unfolds, leading to a collaborative exercise in community building.  “Web3 gave me an outlet to raise money that I didn't have,” said Dickson. “If we have a whole new way of fundraising that activates people who weren't activated before, that's kind of amazing.”  Legal considerations  Launching an NFT project comes with many legal considerations, especially when you add elements of fundraising.  First, there needs to be careful navigation around payment structures. Dickson and CowgirlDAO set up the appropriate structures through Endaoment, a tax-exempt nonprofit that facilitates crypto donations to charitable organizations. The Ethereum-based platform enables donors to connect a crypto wallet and donate almost any crypto or digital asset, which is then exchanged into USDC (a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar) via the decentralized exchange Uniswap and deposited into a selected fund's smart contract.  Free crypto fundraising platform givepact, a finalist in the Web3 Pitch Fest, is also slated to launch a crypto donation solution in 2023.  That said, artists who want to form a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) as Dickson did might also consider seeking legal nonprofit status as a complement to the DAO structure. Doing so allows a community to accept traditional donation methods in addition to crypto ones, a benefit for social causes that are looking to expand their Web3 payment options.  “We have both on-chain rails and off-chain rails,” said Christian Narvaez, co-founder of Web3 Familia, a Latinx education community that has both a nonprofit operations branch as well as an LLC branch that earns revenue. At the same time, the founders are also building a DAO, an approach that he calls something of a “trifecta.”  “We got fiscal sponsorship from the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation,” explained Narvaez. Because the organization is a 501(c)(3) focusing on Web3 education, Web3 Familia’s sponsorship allows it to accept traditional donations through credit cards and checks as well as crypto funds generated through its core activities. According to Narvaez, partnering with or forming a legal nonprofit entity allows Web3 projects to “transact with legacy institutions that may not understand what Web3 is yet,” but still want to support your work.  Then there are laws about buying and selling securities. For the most part, selling NFTs as works of art has been permissible in the U.S. under the Howey Test, a four-part checklist to determine if an asset is considered a security, which would therefore mean it is subject to U.S. securities laws.  Presently, donating proceeds from NFT sales doesn’t trigger any regulatory red flags. However, if your project uses NFT ownership as a membership of some kind, it’s important to avoid promising positive appreciation of the asset’s value. Promises of profit derived from the effort of others mimic the structure of a security, and it may attract buyers who view your NFT as an investment, not a charitable donation.  Ultimately, buyers will decide to donate to your project for different reasons. Similar to a physical art auction, some collectors will be attracted to the artwork itself while others will see the art as a nice bonus alongside the opportunity to donate.  “Who knows why people are incentivized to buy,” said Dickson. “All that mattered to me is that we raised $30,000 and donated it from that first collection.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | UNI,Megan DeMatteo,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/01/how-artists-can-raise-money-for-social-causes-with-nfts,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3d15891f047fed48acf25d34c53dc403010add6a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Bitcoin Is Currently Below, But Near, The $21.1k Realized Price According to the latest weekly report from Glassnode, the realized and the balanced price models are suitable for approximating the bottom formation range for BTC. The &apos;realized price&apos; is a Bitcoin value model based on the idea of realized cap. In simple terms, what it represents is the cost-basis of the average holder in the market. This means that whenever the true BTC price is trading below this metric, the market as a whole enters into a state of loss. Another model for Bitcoin is the &apos;balanced price,&apos; which is calculated by taking the difference between the realized price and the transferred price. The former of the two is, as explained before, the mean cost-basis, or the price the average investor &apos;paid&apos; for their coins. The latter model, the new &apos;transferred price,&apos; signifies just the opposite. It&apos;s based on the price that investors have been selling their coins at, and thus represents the price at which they &apos;spent&apos; their BTC.

42413736,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBxyo,1667318318,Bondholders of Troubled Bitcoin Miner Core Scientific Said to Be Working With Lawyers: Report,"A group of convertible bond holders of Core Scientific (CORZ), the largest bitcoin miner by computing power, is in talks with restructuring attorneys at Paul Hastings, reported Bloomberg Law, citing people with knowledge of the situation.  Core said last week it was exploring strategic alternatives for raising capital, and warned that bankruptcy could be an option. The company also said it hired Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP as legal advisers and PJT Partners LP as financial advisers.  The Bloomberg report Tuesday didn't specify which convertible bondholders have retained the lawyers, and said neither Core nor Paul Hastings had returned calls for comment.  Core Scientific's woes reflect the depressed state of the bitcoin mining industry, with firms facing the squeeze of a bitcoin bear market and higher energy costs. Most recently, bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain (ARBK), said a deal to raise 24 million British pounds (US$27 million) from a strategic investor had fallen through, sending that company's shares tumbling.

42413751,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlByBu,1667318204,Bitcoin Miner Argo Blockchain Loses More Wall Street Bulls After Financial Woes,"Wall Street is increasingly concerned about the future of bitcoin miner Argo Blockchain. Two sell-side analysts downgraded their stock ratings this week as the London-based company faces liquidity issues during a bear market that is crushing the industry.  Argo Blockchain said Monday a deal to sell $27 million of equity to fund operations had fallen through. The miner, which has been hit by low bitcoin prices and high energy costs because it doesn't have a fixed-rate electricity agreement, said it might soon have negative cash flow. That means it may be spending more than it receives on a regular basis.  Investment bank Canaccord Genuity cut its rating to hold from buy, and lowered its target for the company's American Depositary Shares (ARBK) to $1 from $10. Jefferies also downgraded the company to hold from buy, and lowered the price target to $1.10 from $13. Each ADS represents 10 ordinary shares.  ""If indeed it can secure the financing to negotiate a power purchase agreement [PPA], we believe Argo's flagship Helios facility could be better monetized,"" Canaccord analyst Joseph Vafi told clients in a research note. ""But given current macro uncertainty and until Argo can get to the other side of where it is now, we are downgrading shares to hold,"" Vafi wrote.  Meanwhile, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen said that ""locking in a PPA is the most important next step for ARBK and would likely act as a positive catalyst for the stock."" In addition, Argo being able to lower its debt load would add ""significant flexibility in these volatile times,"" Petersen said in a note to clients.  Argo (ARB) shares on the London Stock Exchange started plunging in early October, when the firm announced a set of strategic actions, including the sale of bitcoin mining rigs, to fulfill its obligations and execute its strategy.

What was a $13 stock a year ago is now just $0.18 at the time of writing. Recall the miner warned investors last week that it may file for bankruptcy protection as it will no longer pay equipment-related debt obligations due in late October and early November, hence CLSK stock dropped 24% just in the past five sessions. &apos;Given that a large portion of its existing debt is equipment financing backed by mining rigs, we believe there&apos;s a good chance that CORZ&apos;s creditors agree to restructure voluntarily in order to not have to take possession of the rigs in the current market where rig prices have fallen 60%+ from 2021 highs,&apos; White wrote in a note to clients. &apos;In order to effectuate a restructuring, it may have to sweeten the deal for creditors through either some form of equity upside (i.e. shares/warrants) or some other arrangement that we believe would likely result in a significant dilution of current shareholder economics,&apos; he added.

42394132,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvXt4h,1667317339,Crypto’s 1907 Moment,"When the Terra system and its UST algorithmic stablecoin collapsed in May, it triggered a meltdown in the crypto world that has been compared with the Great Financial Crisis of 2008. Some people called Terra/UST “Crypto’s Lehman.” Others think the crypto fund Three Arrows Capital, which collapsed in June and took a number of crypto lenders down with it, is more like Lehman and Terra/UST perhaps more akin to Bear Stearns.  But although it’s tempting to draw analogies with the Great Financial Crisis, there’s one crucial difference. In the Great Financial Crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve intervened to keep markets functioning and bail out banks. But there’s no Federal Reserve for crypto. Although the Fed manages dollar liquidity, it does not take any account of conditions in crypto markets. There’s no U.S. government institution supporting crypto.  Frances Coppola, a CoinDesk columnist, is a freelance writer and speaker on banking, finance and economics. Her book “The Case for People’s Quantitative Easing” explains how modern money creation and quantitative easing work, and advocates “helicopter money” to help economies out of recession.  The real equivalent of this crypto meltdown is not the 2008 financial crisis, nor even the 1929 Wall Street crash. No, it’s a crisis that pre-dates the creation of the Fed – the “Panic” of 1907.  We tend to think of financial crises, whether in traditional finance or crypto, as network failures. But in the 1907 crisis the story is really about interconnected individuals. One man’s disastrous mistake caused systematic collapses of institutions connected to him by personal relationships. Similarly, underlying this year’s crypto meltdown is a story of broken friendships and betrayed trust.  The dramatis personae of the 1907 crisis were the brothers F. Augustus and Otto Heinze; the banker Charles W. Morse; Charles T. Barney, president of the Knickerbocker Trust Company; and the financier John Pierpont Morgan. The bank Morgan founded is today one of the largest in the world, and still bears his name: JPMorgan.  The crisis started with the dramatic collapse of a copper mining company, United Copper Company, which was majority-owned by the Heinze brothers. Otto Heinze believed speculators were borrowing United Copper’s stock in order to short it. So he tried to corner the market, as Charles Morse had done with New York City’s ice market. Otto Heinze bought large quantities of the stock to push up the price and squeeze the speculators out – what is known as a “short squeeze.” But Otto’s belief was mistaken. Traders were able to cover their positions. The short squeeze failed. The company collapsed, and the Heinzes, who had borrowed heavily to buy the stock, were financially ruined.  Read more: Noelle Acheson - The Myth of ‘Regulatory Clarity’  Failure of a copper company shouldn’t have triggered a financial crisis. But the Heinzes, and their close friend Morse, were extraordinarily well connected. Augustus Heinze owned a bank, the State Savings Bank in Butte, Montana, which was holding United Copper stocks as collateral against some of its lending. When United Copper collapsed, it became insolvent. This triggered a run on three banks connected to Morse.  All three banks were members of “clearinghouses,” consortiums of banks that collectively guaranteed to clear each other’s checks. So the deposits that ran from them simply ended up in other banks. The New York Clearing House Association eventually stopped the runs by forcing Morse and Heinze to resign all their banking interests. But by that time the crisis had widened to another group of financial institutions – the trust companies.  Sam Bankman-Fried is today’s Morgan, sole arbiter of which companies live and which are allowed to die.  Trust companies were unregulated deposit-taking and lending institutions – what we would now call “shadow banks.” They could invest customers’ funds in a wider range of assets than banks, including risky assets such as common equity in the proliferating startup enterprises of that time. And because they could take more risks, they could pay higher interest rates, out-competing banks for deposits. Not surprisingly, depositors looking for higher interest rates flocked to them, believing they were as safe as banks.  But trust companies did not have banks’ protection from illiquidity. They did not have to maintain even the 5% cash reserves required of banks at that time. They were not clearinghouse members, though some gained access to clearinghouse guarantees by forming alliances with banks. If a trust company got into trouble, no bank or trust company would bail it out. Like today’s crypto banks, it would simply collapse, taking its customers’ money with it.  Read more: David Z. Morris - Is Credit Suisse a Canary in the Financial Industry Coal Mine?  Trust companies marketed themselves as robust institutions that were as safe as or safer than banks. But in reality they were highly leveraged and very fragile – just like the crypto banks that marketed themselves as better than banks and claimed banking guarantees to which they were not entitled.  The Knickerbocker Trust Company was among America’s largest trust companies. It occupied an imposing building in New York City, on the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue at West 34th Street. Its president, Charles T. Barney, was a respectable financier. No one thought the Knickerbocker could fail.  But among Barney’s close connections was Charles Morse. Rumors spread that Barney had used Knickerbocker Trust funds to finance the Heinzes’ attempted “corner.” Depositors flocked to withdraw their money. The Knickerbocker paid out $8 million in three hours, wiping out its liquidity and forcing it to close its doors. Barney appealed to J.P. Morgan for assistance. But Morgan decided the bank was insolvent and he refused to bail it out – just as in the crypto meltdown, billionaire FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried decided crypto lender Celsius Network was insolvent and refused to bail it out after the Terra crash.  The Knickerbocker Trust’s failure triggered a widespread run on banks and trust companies. Banks stopped lending to each other and stock prices collapsed as brokers, unable to obtain liquidity, stopped trading. Morgan brought together a consortium of wealthy individuals to provide immediate liquidity to the market, and persuaded banks and trust companies to support each other.  But the crisis rolled on, becoming too much for even these very wealthy men to handle. So Morgan used the press and the clergy to send reassuring messages to the public. In the end it was spin doctoring, backed by a $100 million liquidity guarantee from the New York Clearing House, that ended the systemic runs – though not for long. A second phase of the crisis started in November 1907, this time triggered by failure of a brokerage that had unwisely accepted shares in a failing steel company as collateral. Again, Morgan was forced to intervene to rescue banks and trust companies.  The entire U.S. financial system had come to depend on one man. No wonder Congress decided something more robust was needed. The 1907 crisis led directly to the creation of the Federal Reserve banking system.  In 2022, as in 1907, one man brought down the system, and one man has shored it up. Do Kwon is crypto’s equivalent, not of Otto Heinze but of Charles Morse, the banker whose personal interconnectedness created such terrible fragility. Sam Bankman-Fried is today’s Morgan, sole arbiter of which companies live and which are allowed to die.  And the lesson for crypto from the 1907 crisis is that financial stability ultimately depends not on the reliability of technology, but on the trustworthiness of people.",NEGATIVE,없음,BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION | TRADING,Frances Coppola,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/opinion/2022/11/01/cryptos-1907-moment,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9eb6be8436c71f51c64dd7e6f7b7781e539e7805-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42413738,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBxzk,1667316509,DeFi Debt Marketplace Credix to Open a $150M Stablecoin Credit Pool to Digital Lender Clave,"Credix Finance, a decentralized credit marketplace, unveiled a $150 million stablecoin credit pool to Clave, a digital lending platform, to originate loans to businesses and consumers in Latin America, the firms said Tuesday.  The credit facility is set to open in 2023, with the debt being denominated in the dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC, according to the statement. As with all Credix credit pools, the Clave debt pool will be split up into various smaller funds called “tranches” to offer investment opportunities for institutional investors with different return-on-risk profiles; tranches with lower risk, for example, would pay less yield.  Clave will receive funds via on-chain transactions and smart contracts in USDC into the firm’s crypto wallet, which it can convert to any type of traditional currency in order to lend to their borrowers, Credix Chief Growth Officer Chaim Finizola told CoinDesk.  Credix connects fintech companies and non-bank lenders that need capital to originate loans to their users with institutional investors such as hedge funds and family offices on the prowl for yield. The Belgium-based firm has an outstanding credit of $26 million using USDC on the Solana blockchain, according to data from decentralized finance data platform DefiLlama.  Clave originates loans to businesses and consumers in Argentina and Colombia, with plans to expand to Mexico next year.  The partnership comes at a time when crypto and traditional debt markets are increasingly becoming commingled as crypto companies bring and tokenize real-world assets such as traditional loans, mortgages and government bonds onto the blockchain.  Maker, one of the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in crypto, recently incorporated $500 million in U.S. Treasury bonds to its reserve that backs the DAI stablecoin.  Clave’s debt from the Credix credit pool is collateralized by the receivables from the borrowers who take out loans, Finizola said. Technically, however, the debt is unsecured, meaning the debtor secures the loan with its reputation and its good financial situation and does not pledge any assets whose value would backstop the loan in case of a default.  Unsecured lending is standard procedure in traditional finance and is getting increasingly popular on DeFi lending protocols, but recent defaults demonstrate that there are several challenges and risks to implementing it in such a new and volatile market as crypto assets.

Among young and diverse voters, economic woes were even more likely to pique an interest in cryptocurrencies.  Nearly 40% of voters under the age of 45 reported being more interested in crypto in the current economic climate, compared to only 15% of those 45 or older. Approximately one-third of Black and Latino voters told pollsters they were more crypto-curious because of the economy, while only 21% of white voters polled said the same. Over half of voters surveyed who did not already own crypto said they were waiting until the economy improves before investing.  Poll results also indicated that young and diverse voters aren’t just more likely to be interested in crypto – they’re also more likely to own it already. Roughly a third of Black (30%), Latino (32%) and young voters under the age of 45 (33%) already own cryptocurrencies.  U.S. midterm elections are around the corner, and crypto-friendly candidates (and many of the crypto companies that support them) are working overtime to win over voters, but poll results have so far been mixed about whether crypto investors are likely to vote in line with their wallets.  Of the 2,000 voters surveyed by Grayscale (which, like CoinDesk, is owned by Digital Currency Group), 37% said they would factor candidates’ policy positions on crypto before casting a vote. However, another poll released last week by the Crypto Council for Innovation revealed that crypto is unlikely to be a deciding factor for the majority of voters, with only 6% of all respondents describing themselves as “much more likely” to vote for a politician who supports crypto.  Regulation dreams  Though it remains to be seen whether crypto ownership will translate into votes for crypto-friendly candidates during the midterm elections, the overwhelming majority of voters surveyed in Grayscale’s poll indicated that they want more crypto-savvy politicians in office – and that they want those politicians to establish a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry.  Over 80% of Democrats surveyed and 77% of Republicans want clearer regulation on crypto – both for the industry and for investors. Three-quarters of respondents told pollsters they don’t understand the current crypto regulations, and 57% said they’d be more interested in investing in cryptocurrencies if regulations were clearer.  The findings of the survey are in line with other polls, which have found that a majority of U.S. voters – including many crypto holders – want the industry to be more regulated.  However, Grayscale’s poll revealed that, while voters want more regulation, they don’t want the industry to be regulated out of existence. Over 80% of both Republicans and Democrats agreed that they want the government to take a consumer-first approach to regulation, allowing individual investors to make their own decisions about how to invest in the crypto markets.",NEUTRAL,없음,BUSINESS | MARKET | REGULATION,Cheyenne Ligon,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/01/a-quarter-of-americans-say-inflation-economy-woes-sparking-interest-in-crypto-poll-finds,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/ef798372c615ee9dcde78771baeceb238a19d251-1024x768.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

""While our industry continues to face macroeconomic headwinds, Galaxy remains focused on building for the future state of institutional adoption and on enhancing long-term shareholder value. We are always considering optimal team structure and strategy and will share future plans when finalized,"" a Galaxy spokesman told CoinDesk via email.  The crypto winter has cast a shadow over the industry, forcing some of the biggest companies in the digital-assets sector to curb their growth ambitions. CoinDesk estimates that as of Oct. 14 11,700 crypto jobs had been lost since the beginning of April, based on media reports and press releases. Crypto exchanges Coinbase (COIN), Gemini and Crypto.com as well as New York Digital Investment Group have all made big job cuts.  In August, Galaxy reported a second-quarter net loss of $554.7 million, more than triple the loss of the year-earlier quarter, and assets under management dropped 40% from the first quarter.  Novogratz has said that he expected Galaxy to finish the year with more than 400 employees, compared with fewer than 300 at the start of 2022.  “We are a growth company,” Novogratz said on the second-quarter earnings call. Galaxy is investing in people, products and engineering teams not only for the near term, but for years to come, he said.  The company is scheduled to report its third-quarter results before the market opens on Nov. 9. Its shares were up 2% early Tuesday, but are down 80% in the past year.

The payment method was tested in 10 stores over the past five months and is now available in 39 stores across the country, according to The Times.  The Lightning Network is a layer 2 scaling tool for the Bitcoin blockchain that reduces the time it takes to send a transaction and that is also much cheaper than the main Bitcoin network, making it more appealing to merchants.  “The transaction is as easy and secure as swiping a debit or credit card. Customers scan a QR code from the app and accept the rand conversion rate on their smartphone at the time of the transaction,"" a spokesperson for Pick n Pay said in the report, referring to South Africa's currency.  “The service fee for each transaction is minimal, costing the customer on average 70c (about 4 cents) and takes less than 30 seconds,"" the spokesperson added.

India's central bank is introducing a pilot program for a central bank digital currency on Tuesday, and a retail version will start within a month. In a statement, the Reserve Bank of India said the use case for the wholesale digital rupee is the ""settlement of secondary market transactions in government securities"" because it would reduce transaction costs.

42413747,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJlBy8A,1667301101,Bernstein: Small Economic Recovery Would Make Ether's Tokenomics Favorable,"Ether (ETH), the native token of the Ethereum blockchain, needs “very little recovery in economic activity for the token economics to turn favorable,” Bernstein said in a research report, and that creates a strong story for the cryptocurrency’s “asymmetric growth model.”  Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), a software upgrade that was called the Merge, substantially improved ether’s tokenomics with around 90% lower emissions, possible deflation and more than 5% staking yields, according to the report published Monday.  With the success of layer 2 blockchains, ether can position itself as a category leader within the digital-assets market, the report added.  The Merge was the first of five upgrades planned for the blockchain and involved the shift from a proof-of-work (PoW) method of validating transactions and securing the network to a more energy-efficient PoS consensus mechanism. Layer 2s are separate blockchains, built on top of layer 1s that reduce bottlenecks. A layer 1 network is the base layer, or the underlying infrastructure of a blockchain.  Bernstein estimates that ETH’s deflation could reach about 4% annually, noting that current burn activity is being led by decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible-token (NFT) exchanges and token transfers.  The broker estimates that the break-even level of daily fees needed to fully offset gross ETH issuance is around 2,100 ETH, which is where current levels stand, meaning that there is a small reduction in the supply outstanding.  “Ethereum’s modular approach to scaling will improve transaction speed and affordability,” the note said, and lower fees will allow more users to come onto the blockchain.  The layer-2 scalability road map will lead to the launch and adoption of Ethereum-compatible zero-knowledge (ZK) rollups, and Bernstein forecasts monthly active users for the Ethereum stack will jump to about 500 million by 2032 from around 8.5 million now.  ZK-rollups are Ethereum layer 2 protocols that process transactions separately from the main network to help increase speed and lower fees.

The Nasdaq-listed company mined 74.58 bitcoins (BTC) in October, a 78% increase from last October, when it mined 41.84 bitcoins.  The crypto-mining industry has been thrust into uncertainty this year because of soaring energy prices and a market downtrend. Bitcoin miners have felt the squeeze, including Core Scientific (CORZ), which said that it may explore bankruptcy if its financial situation fails to improve.  Digihost, meanwhile, now holds about $2.45 million worth of bitcoin and $1.29 million of ether (ETH) based on crypto prices on Oct. 31. It also holds $3.42 million in cash.  In order to remain cash-flow positive, Digihost sold a portion of its bitcoin holdings in October to cover energy costs.  ""Despite current volatile economic conditions, Digihost has been able to maintain good liquidity levels of cash and crypto holdings on a month-to-month basis relative to the size of our operations and of equal importance, the company continues to be debt free,"" CEO Michel Amar said in the release.

India will host the annual G-20 summit next year.  Sitharaman made her remarks Tuesday at an annual event hosted by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.  She said India needs to encourage international groups such as the International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Board and the Organization for Economic Co-operation to help form crypto regulations with ""all countries being on board.""  ""No one single country can succeed in individually, being in a silo, trying to regulate the crypto assets,"" she said.  Sitharaman said India hasn't set crypto-specific legislation yet because ""we need to have all the members of the G-20 first of all to come on board to see how best it can be done.""  At the same conference, V. Anantha Nageswaran, India's chief economic adviser, echoed Sitharaman's comments, saying that identifying ""consensus-based solutions for accelerating the scale and scope of the response of the global community to many transboundary challenges such as regulation of virtual assets"" will be a priority of India's G-20 presidency.  For her part, Sitharaman made clear she was talking about crypto as an asset and not as a currency, which is the domain of the Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank.  Regulating crypto as an asset is ""in the national interest because you don’t know what the trail leads you to. Is it drug funding? Is it terror funding? Or is it just gaming the system and so on?” she said.  Showcasing India’s digital revolution will be another priority during the G-20 presidency and that involves the nation’s central bank digital currency, which the RBI started to test on Tuesday, Sitharaman said.

42415109,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXPqW,1667295676,"Crypto Regulation Will Be a Priority for G-20 Under India Presidency, Official Says","India has hinted that crypto regulation would be a priority during the country's year-long presidency of the G-20, which begins next month.  Identifying ""consensus-based solutions for accelerating the scale and scope of the response of the global community to many transboundary challenges such as regulation of virtual assets,"" would be the third objective of India's G-20 presidency, the chief economic adviser to the government, V. Anantha Nageswaran, said during a Tuesdayspeech at an annual event hosted by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) on the upcoming G-20 conference.  The G-20 is an intergovernmental forum made up of 19 economies and the European Union. Indonesia currently holds the presidency of the group. India will not only take over the G-20 presidency starting in December, but will also host the G-20 Leaders’ Summit for the first time next year.  With the presidency, India – which has passed what the local industry has criticized as a crippling tax regime while the country's central bank has called for a ban on cryptocurrencies – will now have a prominent role in framing global crypto regulation. As hosts, India will set the agenda for the year, identifying themes and focus areas for economic growth. India's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, had already said crypto will be part of the agenda, but this may be the first indication of it being a primary objective.  Nageswaran was standing in for Ajay Seth, secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs and the most senior government officer of India's Finance Ministry responsible for shaping the narrative of the G-20 conference.  The G-20's Finance Track includes meetings among the forum's finance ministers and central bank governors. Around 40 meetings are expected to be organized in the Finance Track, focusing on areas such as international financial architecture, local media reported. The process also involves the ""Sherpa Track"" in which ""Sherpas"" (negotiators, usually senior members of the staff of the heads of state and government) prepare the summit. Under the Sherpa Track, about 100 official meetings are expected to be organized around areas such as employment, health and the digital economy. Both Seth and Nageswaran could be seen as Sherpas in the process.  Nageshwaran also highlighted ""food and energy insecurity"" as another key objective of India's G-20 presidency in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The group will also look at strengthening multilateral institutions to serve the development needs of countries to take on global challenges.

42415123,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXQxV,1667295631,Fed Preview: Crypto Market Sees Smaller Rate Hikes From December but Major Banks Warn 'Slower Doesn't Mean Lower',"Risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, have recently found a footing on hopes the Federal Reserve will pivot away from jumbo interest rate hikes from December to end the so-called liquidity tightening sooner than expected, and will signal that at its Nov. 2 meeting.  However, major investment banks believe the Fed could keep the doors open for continued jumbo rate hikes, and a potential switch to smaller rate hikes would not necessarily imply an early end of liquidity tightening.  The Fed has raised the borrowing cost by 300 basis points (bps) this year, roiling risk assets. The central bank is expected to deliver its fourth 75 bps hike on Wednesday, lifting the borrowing cost to the 3.75%-4% range. It could signal a step down to 50 bps hike in December.  The markets appear to have run ahead of themselves in pricing a slowdown in terms of both frequency and magnitude of rate hikes starting from December. Traders expect the rate hike cycle to peak at around 4.8%, down from the terminal rate of 5% priced two weeks ago, according to the futures tied to the Fed funds rate. Bitcoin has gained 10% in two weeks, while the dollar index has dropped by over 2%.  Inflation remains sticky, suggesting the Fed has little room to turn dovish and halt rate hikes anytime soon, which is a negative sign for risk assets.  The data released on Friday showed the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, the core PCE, rose 0.5% month on month in September, the same as in August, leaving the year-on-year increase at 5.1%. That's significantly higher than the annual inflation target of 2%. Further, employment costs continue to rise at the double the rate registered over the past 15 years.  The Fed could continue to hike rates at a slower pace for longer, potentially lifting borrowing costs well above the terminal rate of 4.8% priced in by markets.  ""The Fed will stress data dependence next week. They will get two more NFP and CPI prints before the [December] meeting; if they stay hot, another 75 bps is in the cards, if not, a deceleration to 50 bps is possible,"" strategists at Bank of America wrote in a weekly note sent to clients on Friday. ""While the market badly wants a pivot, slower doesn't mean lower.""  ""The Fed isn't done hiking until the data says so. Core CPI is at cycle highs, U3 unemployment is at cycle lows. Corporates tell us their top challenge is hiring. China and U.S. are decoupling. [Capital expenditure] is rising. Food and energy are increasingly scarce. Inflationary pressures seem broad-based and increasingly entrenched. Short-term survey inflation expectations have risen. The Fed's job is not done,"" strategists added.  Barclays' credit research team voiced a similar opinion in the weekly note, saying a potential bias for smaller rate hikes wouldn't mark a dovish pivot in the true sense of the word.  ""The Fed needs to see inflation turning and labor market conditions deteriorating before turning meaningfully dovish. As such, we think it is likely to retain optionality for December, so we see limited further downside for the [U.S. dollar] and could see the broad dollar rebound this week,"" Barclays' credit research team said.  A dollar rebound will likely weigh over risk assets, including cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin tends to move in the opposite direction of the dollar.  Lee Hardman, currency analyst at MUFG Bank, said in Tuesday's client note, ""If the Fed does slow the pace of hikes in December, it does not necessarily mean as well that the total amount of tightening delivered in the current tightening cycle will be less, although that will be the initial assumption.""  ""It could be that the Fed slows the pace of hikes but eventually keeps hiking for longer,"" Hardman added.  Here is what other banks expect:  Danske Bank  ""It is too early to turn soft for the Fed, and we look for a 75 bps hike and hawkish communication. Fed to hike by another 150 bps this year, then stop.""  ING  ""While we may well get a 'stepdown' in the pace of tightening from December onwards, it is clear that inflation is far from defeated, and the risks are that rate hikes could continue for longer.""  SEB group  ""We expect Fed Chair [Jerome] Powell to repeat that policy is data dependent and will be decided on a meeting-by-meeting basis, but also that it, at some point, likely would be appropriate to slow the pace of increases, thus keeping all options on the table for December, when the FOMC will release new economic and rate forecasts.""",NEUTRAL,없음,ASIA | BTC | FIAT | MARKET | RESEARCH,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/01/fed-preview-as-crypto-market-sees-smaller-rate-hikes-from-december-major-banks-warn-slower-doesnt-mean-lower,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a961f4b7d744f4d0ebfb885a5cb0fb3972858c5d-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415111,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXPvp,1667295254,Porter Finance Team Returns for Second Shot at DeFi Bonds Project,"Three of the four people behind now-defunct decentralized finance (DeFi) bonds tool Porter Finance relaunched the project on Monday, months after Porter was shut due to a lack of demand from borrowers.  Rebranded as Arbor Finance, the protocol is designed to allow decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) raise money by borrowing against their native tokens with no liquidations and at fixed interest rates through tokenized DeFi bonds.  Selling bonds to raise money is an attractive alternative to selling tokens and gives DAOs another way of funding growth, the developers said in an email to CoinDesk. The bond buyers receive high fixed yields in exchange for lending to these DAOs.  “We expect lenders to earn 10%-20% APY on bonds issued through Arbor,” co-founder Russell Bookland said in an email.  Bonds allow DAOs to borrow funds at fixed interest rates without the fear of liquidation by using their native tokens, which make up the majority of their treasuries. Borrowers using collateralized debt positions on other protocols must maintain a particular collateral ratio or risk being liquidated.  Porter Finance shut in July after founder Jordan Meyer cited a lack of demand amid a market-wide price decline and overall waning sentiment about the long-term growth of cryptocurrencies. At the time, Porter said it was “not confident” there would be large inflows of lending demand for the fixed-income DeFi products it offered. This was primarily due to the competitiveness of rates offered in traditional finance and the lack of institutional fixed-income DeFi adoption over the previous year.  Other core team members say there’s still a market for its product, especially as market sentiment improves.  “Three out of the four team members at Porter still feel that the potential for on-chain bond issuances is a massive market,” Bookland said. “The potential for high APY for lenders and non-dilutive funding for DAOs is far too big of an opportunity to ignore. We, therefore, decided to build Arbor Finance with a fork of Porter's code.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2022/11/01/porter-finance-team-returns-for-second-shot-at-defi-bonds-project,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/bf2fb64bb4bc73cd9c7a9df82a875d8bcc7a78a8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Names like “babyDogeTwitter,” “dogenaldtrump,” “spaceTwitterDoge,” and “elonDogeTwit,” populated the two blockchains after Musk tweeted an image of a Shiba Inu dog wearing a Twitter T-shirt in front of a classic Halloween pumpkin with the social media platform’s bird logo etched on the side of it.  Blockchain security firm PeckShield said in a tweet in Asian afternoon hours that over 67 of such tokens fell 90% in the hours following their issuance, with 45 tokens falling 100%. This cumulatively led to losses of thousands of dollars among investors who punted on the newly issued tokens in hopes of a long-term price appreciation.  Over 42 tokens were marked by PeckShield as honeypots, a term that describes illicit tokens that change permissions on unsuspecting users’ crypto wallets, with the goal of eventually transferring all their crypto tokens out of those wallets into one controlled by a scammer.  Musk’s tweet also sparked off a rally in dogecoin, which jumped over 14 cents to gain more than 23% in the past 24 hours. Floki Inu, another Shiba Inu-themed token, also surged by a similar figure, while Shiba Inu’s SHIB tokens jumped 8%.  Such irrational exuberance came amid a relatively flat crypto market, with bitcoin and ether rising nominally in the past 24 hours.  Musk has been a major supporter of DOGE, which has become a proxy for sentiment about him. The entrepreneur's statements about the token have also consistently influenced its price, as previously reported.  Dogecoin has been on a run ever since Musk confirmed his takeover of Twitter last week, with the token’s futures racking up over $90 in liquidations over the weekend in an unusual move. The DOGE price doubled in October, the best performance among the 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index.",NEGATIVE,DOGE | SHIB | BNB,DOGE | MARKET | SHIB | TRADING | BNB,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/01/elon-musk-tweet-sparks-flurry-of-twitter-themed-dogecoin-tokens,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/9174e0379ddea8def8652f6edfc4d483afd6f99a-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415120,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXQWy,1667293200,Stepn Parent Company Launches NFT Marketplace,"Find Satoshi Lab, the parent company of the move-to-earn application Stepn, is releasing MOOAR, a membership-based, multi-chain non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace.  The addition of a marketplace helps the company to develop its self-sustaining ecosystem alongside the existing Stepn fitness app and DOOAR, a Solana-based decentralized exchange (DEX).  Not only will MOOAR users be able to purchase the sneakers necessary to use Stepn (which currently trade at a floor price of 0.98 SOL, or about $32 on Magic Eden), but can additionally build and sell NFT collections on the platform. The goal is for the three apps to work “in collaboration to actively support each other,” the platform wrote in a press release.  Notably, the platform is launching with zero platform fees and no optional royalties.  Over the past two months, NFT platforms X2Y2, Magic Eden and most recently LooksRare have all dropped the requirement to pay out royalties to creators when purchasing tokens.  Shiti Rastogi Manghani, COO of Stepn, told CoinDesk that failing to support artists in the long term will be detrimental to the value of NFTs, and that MOOAR aims to fairly compensate creators.  “You can already see on some of the platforms that have started the 0% royalty fee, that the downward trend on volumes is a sign of things to come,” said Manghani. “This is why we're taking such a hard and strong stance, that we want to stand by creators and we want to enforce this rule in the fee structure.”  Creators intending to sell on MOOAR can set royalty fees between 0.5% and 10%, with a default rate of 2%.  Find Satoshi Lab released its flagship product Stepn in late 2021, reporting $122.5 million in Q2 profits this year. In June, the company released DOOAR, and according to data from Dune Analytics, it currently has the largest number of daily active wallets across other decentralized exchanges running on Solana.",POSITIVE,SOL,EXCHANGE | SOL | SPONSORED | TRADING,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/web3/2022/11/01/stepn-parent-company-launches-nft-marketplace,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c469d6bce81787675fa5cd95765eb1286a609090-448x290.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42415129,Qdo0jHtYInnpQ8tboBXRDQ,1667270156,Dogecoin Led the Pack Among Cryptocurrencies in October With 17 Times Bitcoin's Gains,"Give that DOGE a bone.  Dogecoin (DOGE), the canine-inspired meme token often associated with electric-vehicle-tycoon-turned-Twitter-owner Elon Musk, was the top performer in October among the 150 digital assets in the CoinDesk Market Index (CMI).  The DOGE price rose 101% during the month, vastly outpacing the 7% climb in the CMI overall. Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, was up 5.5% on the month, while ether (ETH) gained 18%.  Digital-asset analysts attributed the big jump in DOGE to Musk’s dramatic $44 billion takeover of Twitter – ostensibly tied to speculation that the deal might somehow, eventually, bring value or utility to the Dogecoin blockchain and its eponymous cryptocurrency.  During a May 2021 appearance on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” Musk used the line, “Call me the Dogefather.” And in January 2021, Musk used Twitter to send out an image of himself holding up a Shiba Inu puppy – the dog breed that inspired dogecoin.  Musk at one point suggested – perhaps in jest, perhaps not – charging 0.1 DOGE per tweet.  Dogecoin rose “on the back of excitement over Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter,” the digital-asset investment fund QCP Capital wrote Monday in a note on Telegram. “Musk's tweets have created price swings in the past, even suggesting using DOGE as payment for a Twitter subscription.”  Katie Talati, head of research at crypto asset-management firm Arca Funds, said dogecoin’s recent trading spikes “have very much been speculation-driven,” similar to last year’s frenzy in meme stocks.  “It's the same way as people trading GameStop and AMC,” Talati said. “It’s a token that drove a lot of retail interest.”  CoinDesk Market Index constituents  Among the CMI index constituents, Mask Network’s MASK token was the second-best performer in October, with a 96% return, followed by the decentralized crypto exchange SushiSwap’s SUSHI token, which surged 45%. SushiSwap’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) approved a restructuring last week.  Ether’s monthly return was fueled partly by a short squeeze last week. The cryptocurrency has benefited from fresh speculation following the Ethereum blockchain’s Merge last month, which shifted the network to a more energy-efficient “proof-of-stake” network. The change also drastically reduced the pace at which the blockchain is producing new tokens – implying less overall supply.  Bitcoin’s return during the month was more muted, but bulls were enthused by its price jump above $20,000 for the first time in 18 days.  Talati attributed ETH’s outperformance over BTC to “market structure,” given that more traders had been betting against ETH than BTC – and not an indication of“anything fundamentally shifting.”  “Bitcoin doesn't really have a strong narrative right now, whereas ETH still does have the Merge narrative,” she said.  October’s losses  Rally (RLY), an ERC-20 token, was the biggest loser in the CMI, falling 33% in October.  The insolvent crypto lending platform Celsius Network’s native token CEL lost 27%, amid reports that its former CEO, Alex Mashinsky, withdrew $10 million in the weeks before the company froze customer accounts.  Another big loser was Terra Luna Classic’s LUNC token, which also lost 31% during the month – potentially dashing hopes among traders who had hoped for a recovery following the network’s collapse in May.  LUNA, the native coin of the Terra 2.0 blockchain, the fork that emerged from Terra Classic, slid around 1% during the month. Its controversial co-founder, Do Kwon, denied claims in October that he is on the run from law enforcement, despite Interpol issuing a “red notice” for his arrest in September. Earlier this month, Terra’s developers attempted to revive the LUNA ecosystem and increase user activity with the token.  What’s ahead in November? Talati said the World Cup could spark interest in sports-fan tokens like Chiliz (CHZ), from “the advertising perspective.”  She said she “wouldn't be surprised” to see crypto ads on banners around the stadium during matches – similar to Coinbase putting up a QR code in an ad during the Super Bowl in February.  Dogecoin likely will continue to ride waves of speculation. “At the end of the day, there aren't like financial applications built on top of it,” Talati said.",POSITIVE,BTC | DOGE | LUNC,BTC | DOGE | LUNC | MARKET | TRADING,Jocelyn Yang,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/11/01/dogecoin-led-the-pack-among-cryptocurrencies-in-october-with-17-times-bitcoins-gains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/05dd298825c94fa100d01c9bc34d95f2d1f7ab71-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET  Prices  DOGE Continues Its Late October Surge  By James Rubin  The DOGE days of October continued as the popular meme coin outshone bitcoin, ether and a number of other major cryptocurrencies in Monday trading.  Dogecoin was recently up more than 1% over the past 24 hours to continue its late-month surge, and was recently trading at about 12 cents. DOGE, which was created to mock the speculative nature of cryptocurrencies, spiked late last week as billionaire entrepreneur and DOGE advocate Elon Musk neared the completion of his $44 billion purchase of Twitter. Over the past four days Musk has asserted his control over the social media platform. On Monday, he ousted Twitter’s nine-person board.  As CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote, DOGE’s price fluctuations seem to stem from the power of Musk’s personality and a passionate dogecoin community than the macroeconomic indicators that have been influencing bitcoin, ether and other cryptos over the past 12 months. DOGE’s rise may correlate with excessive liquidations and a likely short squeeze, and the token may offer a shorting opportunity, Williams wrote.  Bitcoin (BTC) spent Monday in the red and was recently down about 0.8% from Sunday, same time, although the largest cryptocurrency by market value remained comfortably over the $20,000 perch it assumed last week. Ether was down similarly over the same period and was changing hands above the $1,500 level that the second-largest crypto assumed a week ago.  ""Some traders are growing confident that a bottom is in place, options market activity is showing the need for downside protection is easing,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda. ""This will be a pivotal last two months of the year that should trigger a move outside of the $17,500 and $25,000 trading range.""  The CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 0.4% over the past 24 hours.  In traditional markets, the tech-heavy Nasdaq, Standard & Poor’s 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) all closed lower, although the indexes enjoyed a strong month amid faint hopes the U.S. Federal Reserve will ratchet back its hawkish monetary policy early next year. Investors will be eyeing the latest Federal Open Market Committee interest rate hike, which is widely expected to be a robust 75 basis points.

""Now Hong Kong is back inside of the game, Neil Tan, who is also CEO of the blockchain startup Neptune Digital, told The Daily Forkast in an interview. ""And that retail piece does play a huge piece. If you look at the exchanges and market capitalizations, a lot of it drives from the retail side.""  In the policy statement released Monday at Hong Kong FinTech Week, the government's main financial agency, the Financial Services and Treasury Bureau (FSTB), indicated it would conduct a public consultation on how retail investors might attain a “suitable degree of access to virtual assets"" to licensed exchanges. The FSTB said it was reconsidering its stance on virtual asset exchange traded funds (ETF) and tokenized securities, and that it was “ready to engage” with global virtual asset service providers and invite them to the city.  Earlier this year, as part of a move to tighten anti-money laundering regulations, the Hong Kong government moved to license virtual asset service providers (VASP) via a legislative proposal that passed its consultation period. The city's main securities regulatory group, Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), would be provided with ""necessary intervention powers"" to impose restrictions or even prohibitions on companies providing crypto services.  Institutional interest  Tan also noted the desire for more institutions ""to have more coverage into digital assets,"" and he praised the timing of the policy statement's release.  ""You're introducing it inside the winter, so there's little risk in terms of downside,"" he said. ""There's a lot more upside. Everybody else has shown their cards such as Dubai and also Singapore in terms of what the regulatory framework will look like in these jurisdictions.""  He added: ""Hong Kong is in a strong position. We want to build a championship team. We want to to go to the NBA final and win a championship.""
