42402104,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OWr,1540591301,Planting Bitcoin  Part Two: Seasons,"Dan Held is the founder of crypto portfolio service Picks & Shovels. He previously founded data service ZeroBlock, which sold to Blockchain, and served as VP of product at ChangeTip.  This exclusive opinion piece is part of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin at 10: The Satoshi White Paper"" series.        ""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve."" — Satoshi Nakamoto            Introduction  In my last article, ""Species,"" I covered why Satoshi's design of Bitcoin's genetic code made it the best species of money ever created.  Satoshi had begun creating Bitcoin's genetic code in 2007, but had waited for the right moment to plan the seed, the right moment in which the world would understand and embrace what he had created. In this article, I will dive into the moment in which Satoshi precisely chose to plant the Bitcoin seed.    (To enjoy this article in its fullest, I recommend playing this song then continue reading. If you like this music, please follow my playlist on Spotify.)    Central Banks  From the founding of the Bank of England, central banks have been used as a means for states to fund their policies without risking the popular ire caused by direct taxation.  When the capital provided by central banks is misallocated by either the state or in a market distorted by artificially low interest rates, an inevitable collapse occurs.  The central bank is the root of these periodic market dislocations.  ""I believe the root cause of every financial crisis, the root cause, is flawed government policies"" — Henry Paulson (US Treasury Secretary during the 2008 financial crisis and former Goldman Sachs CEO)  With the recent market dislocation, investors were bailed out. Unfortunately, you cannot subsidize irresponsibility and expect people to become more responsible.  Prior to the 20th century, ordinary people could always flee to gold to save themselves from the effects of the failed, inflationist, policies of the central bank. This ended across much of the world in the 20th century as gold was outlawed. — Vijay Boyapati  ""In the absence of the gold standard, there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation. There is no safe store of value."" — Alan Greenspan (Former Chairman of the Federal Reserve)  Satoshi Nakamoto, after years and years of research, starts coding up Bitcoin.  2008 Financial Crisis    ""The problem had grown so big that the end was bound to be cataclysmic and have big social and political consequences"" — Michael Lewis (Big Short)            January  Fed tries to stop the housing bust  The Federal Market Open Committee began lowering the fed funds rate (to 3.0%). There were 57 percent more foreclosures than 12 months earlier  February  Bush signs tax rebate as home sales continue to plummet  February 13: President Bush signed a tax rebate bill to help the struggling housing market. The bill increased limits for FHA loans and allowed Freddie Mac to repurchase jumbo loans.  March  Fed begins bailouts  March 14: The Federal Reserve held its first emergency weekend meeting in 30 years.  March 17: The Federal Reserve announced it would guarantee Bear Stearns' bad loans.  March 18: The Federal Open Market Committee lowered the fed funds rate by 0.75 percent to 2.25 percent. It had halved the interest rate in six months. That same day, federal regulators agreed to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on another $200 billion in subprime mortgage debt.  April — June  The Fed buys more toxic bank debt  June 2: The Fed auctions totaled $1.2 trillion. In June, the Federal Reserve lent $225 billion through its Term Auction Facility.  July  IndyMac bank fails  July 11: The Office of Thrift Supervision closed IndyMac Bank. Los Angeles police warned angry IndyMac depositors to remain calm while they waited in line to withdraw funds from the failed bank.  July 23: Secretary Paulson made the Sunday talk show rounds. He explained the need for a bailout of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two agencies themselves held or guaranteed more than half of the $12 trillion of the nation's mortgages.    (for the next few paragraphs, I HIGHLY recommend listening to this soundtrack)    September  Global panic  September 7: Treasury nationalizes Fannie and Freddie and will run the two until they are strong enough to return to independent management. The Fannie and Freddie bailout initially cost taxpayers $187 billion.  September 15: Lehman Brothers files for chapter 11 bankruptcy, the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history with over $600B in assets. The bankruptcy triggered a one-day drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average of 4.5%, the largest decline since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Later that day, Bank of America officially announced it would purchase struggling Merrill Lynch for $50 billion.  ""It's terrible. Death. Like a massive earthquake.'' — Kirsty McCluskey a Lehman trader in London  September 16: Fed buys AIG for $85 Billion. The company had insured trillions of dollars of mortgages throughout the world. If it had fallen, so would the global banking system. On that same day, the Reserve Primary Fund ""broke the buck."" It didn't have enough cash on hand to pay out all the redemptions that were occurring.  ""I asked my wife to please go to the ATM and take as much cash as she could. When she asked why, I said it was because I didn't know whether there was a chance that banks might not open."" — Mohamed El-Erian (One of the most powerful economists/leaders in finance)  September 17: Economy on the brink of collapse. Panic spreads. Investors withdrew a record $144.5 billion from their money market accounts. During a typical week, only about $7 billion is withdrawn. If it had continued, businesses couldn't get money to fund their day-to-day operations. In just a few weeks, shippers wouldn't have had the cash to deliver food to grocery stores.  Bailouts  October 3: The bank bailout bill allowed Treasury to buy shares of troubled banks. It was the fastest way to inject capital into the frozen financial system. Despite this, global stock markets continue to collapse.  ""Just as our politics are falling apart, our portfolios are falling apart, too."" — Ben Hunt  October 7: The Federal Reserve agreed to issue short-term loads for businesses that couldn't get them elsewhere, to the tune of $1.7 Trillion.  October 13: Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson sits down with 9 major bank CEOs. The total bailout package looks more like $2.25 trillion, well more than the original $700 billion available.  ""September and October of 2008 was the worst financial crisis in global history, including the Great Depression"" — Ben Bernanke  October 14: The governments of the EU, Japan, and the United States again took unprecedented coordinated action. The EU committed to spending $1.8 trillion to guarantee bank financing, buy shares to prevent banks from failing, and take any other steps needed to get banks to lend to each other again. This was after the UK committed $88 billion to purchase shares in failing banks and $438 billion to guarantee loans. In a show of solidarity, the Bank of Japan agreed to lend unlimited dollars.  October 21 — Fed lends $540 Billion to bail out money market funds which are continuing to meet a barrage of redemptions.    ""People feel like nothing in the country is working — the president, Congress, corporations."" (October 15, 2008) Reuters            October 31: Satoshi publishes the Bitcoin whitepaper  Walking on the street in a city Satoshi looks around and notices a businesswoman on her blackberry, hailing a cab. He passes a newspaper stand and sees Miley Cyrus' (known as Hannah Montana) controversial photos in Vanity Fair, she's 15.  George Bush's approval rating is at a record low of 21%, Congress is at 10% — just above its all-time low. Lehman Brothers had just collapsed a month prior.  ""Is now the time? Is the world ready?"" Satoshi thought to himself. He had spent the last few years coding up Bitcoin then writing the whitepaper. He had patiently waited to release it to the world, but the moment had to be right… there was only one shot at this. ""Is the whitepaper easy enough to read? I want to make sure this resonates with the cypherpunks, I'm hoping cash will be most understandable to the other members on the mailing list who have previously created e-currencies.""  ""When the moment is ripe, a fanatic leader galvanizes the ripe population and pushes it to a point of no return. The leader translates the ideals published by the ""men of words [cypherpunks]"" into doctrines [whitepaper] promising sudden and spectacular change."" — Eric Hoffer, author of ""The True Believer"" (via Tony Sheng)  He returned to his home and reviewed the whitepaper for any glaring mistakes the 47th time, he couldn't find any. He leaned back and stared at the wall. He realized this was the moment, it was time to plant the seed. He popped open his e-mail client, checked the draft e-mail to the cryptographer (cypherpunk) e-mailing list and pressed send. There was no going back.  ""Indeed, Bitcoin rose like a phoenix from the ashes of the 2008 global financial catastrophe — a catastrophe that was precipitated by the policies of central banks like the Federal Reserve."" — Vijay Boyapati  With the 2008 financial crisis, trust had been lost in a world that ran on trust.  Bitcoin was launched in a time of absolute necessity, Satoshi planted the seed at precisely the right moment.  Part 3… ""Soil""  In Part 3, I will cover Satoshi's distribution strategy – or the soil in which he planted the seed: the Cypherpunks community. Part 3 of this article will be published in the next few days and linked from Twitter via Tweet storm (follow me).

Regulatory agencies such as the CFTC must better understand how new technologies work and how they might impact global markets in order to help innovators safely access financial networks.

Behnam added that he underwent a ""listening tour"" to learn more about issues around bitcoin and other crypto assets, DLT, artificial intelligence and cloud-based programming as part of an effort to better understand new technologies.  ""I had no single goal in mind, just a desire to avoid being the typical regulator on the tail end of technological advancement, scurrying to keep pace with swift innovations that capture market efficiencies, open markets to new products and participants, and often reward those willing to take risk,"" he explained.

42402085,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OEA,1540569625,IBM and Maersk Struggle to Sign Partners to Shipping Blockchain,"It's hard enough to get enterprises that compete with each other to work together as a team, but it's especially tricky when one of those rivals owns the team.  Shipping giant Maersk and tech provider IBM are wrestling with this problem with TradeLens, their distributed ledger technology (DLT) platform for supply chains.  Some 10 months ago, the project was spun off from Maersk (the largest container shipping company on the planet) into a joint venture with IBM. But in that time the network has enticed only one other carrier onto the platform: Pacific International Lines (PIL), one of eight shipping lines in Asia and 17th in the world based on cargo volumes.  As those involved admit, that's not enough.  In a nutshell, the IBM-Maersk joint collaboration needs more carriers. The platform is designed such that Maersk's rivals will act as ""trust anchors"" and run full blockchain nodes on the network. Moreover, large shippers of goods use multiple carriers and freight-forwarders, and the value proposition involves managing cargo and inventory across all of them.  Not to put too fine a point on it, onboarding other large carriers is an absolutely necessary condition for TradeLens – as Marvin Erdly, head of TradeLens at IBM Blockchain, acknowledged.  ""I won't mince words here – we do need to get the other carriers on the platform. Without that network, we don't have a product. That is the reality of the situation."" he told CoinDesk.  The problem is that Maersk's rival shipping carriers are concerned about joining the platform on a less than equal footing. Indeed, the chiefs of two rival shipping carriers, CMA CGM (third largest by ship fleets and containers) and Hapag-Lloyd (No. 5), have publicly dismissed the Maersk-IBM blockchain solution as unusable. (Neither company responded to calls for comment from CoinDesk.)  TradeLens has tried to address this problem by recasting the arrangement as a ""joint collaboration"" in a bid to appear more neutral than the originally billed joint venture. But in substance, Maersk and IBM each have full and equal rights to the intellectual property (IP).  Erdly said an industry advisory board is one of the governance solutions that will make a difference and that work is ongoing to promote equality on the platform. But he acknowledged the concerns of rival shipping firms, adding:  ""Obviously the fact that Maersk is driving this is both a really good thing and a worrying thing because they are such a big player in the industry. As you can imagine that's going to be a factor.""  Who's the captain?  To Lars Jensen, CEO of SeaIntelligence Consulting, a Copenhagen-based shipping analyst firm, the challenge for IBM and Maersk was apparent early on.  Jensen told CoinDesk he spoke to a group of large carriers about Maersk and IBM's blockchain proposition at a shipping conference in April, three months after the venture was announced.  According to Jensen, ""The other carriers basically said, 'sure, maybe – tell us a bit about it. And by the way, if we do this then who owns the IP rights?' Whereupon they were given the answer that the IP rights would be for Maersk and IBM."" He added:  ""It's not rocket science to guess what all Maersk's competitors said about joining this initiative.""  In a word: no.  To be sure, it's still early days for TradeLens. IBM has made impressive leaps with its other big industry blockchain, the now-live Food Trust, kicked off a couple of years ago in conjunction with retailing behemoth Walmart.  And IBM and Maersk have signed scores of participants from other parts of the shipping supply chain to join the TradeLens platform. These include an array of global port and customs authorities, beneficial cargo owners, freight forwarding and logistics companies (the Port of Montreal and Canada Border and Services Agency are the latest additions).  ""We have had positive engagement with companies across all sectors of our industry thus far, and we're pleased to note that this constructive dialogue has resulted in more than 100 ecosystem participants actively involved or piloting the solution,"" said Michael J. White, Maersk's TradeLens leader.  An obvious question to Jensen (and others in the shipping ecosystem) is why didn't Maersk choose to establish its blockchain under the auspices of INTTRA, the digital platform for booking shipping containers, which started out almost 20 years ago as a truly neutral venture, jointly and equally owned by the shipping carriers (including Maersk).  Inna Kuznetsova, the president and COO of INTTRA (which has 60 carriers transacting on its software-as-a-service, non-blockchain platform) believes the ""jury is still out"" regarding the potential of blockchain in the shipping industry, which, she pointed out, has to be pragmatic thanks to thin margins and limited IT resources.  ""The shipping industry today is tired of the 'big carrot in the end' project,"" said Kuznetsova. ""Selecting IT projects requires a rather thin focus on return on investment and we have seen a high preference for projects which bring savings in six months to a year.""  White of Maersk said its work with IBM ""has a fundamentally different focus and approach than INTTRA in terms of both the solution and technology. We have an ongoing dialogue with INTTRA.""  Staying neutral  Another challenge for TradeLens is that it is not the only game in town.  Accenture has onboarded Singapore-based shipping carrier APL (American President Lines, 12th largest by cargo volume) and freight forwarding giant Kuehne + Nagel to a blockchain pilot involving brewing giant AB InBev and a European customs organization.  Adriana Diener–Veinott, global lead for Accenture Freight & Logistics Services, said the proof of concept began with one stakeholder in each category: a shipper, a forwarder, a shipping line and a customs authority.  ""Right from the beginning, everybody accepts their competitors will be joining and that they would have the same rights. This is how you make an industry platform successful,"" she said.  Diener–Veinott said she was not at liberty to disclose who currently owns the IP of the mini-consortium. However, Accenture said it will be announcing additional carriers in the coming weeks as well as providing an update on its governance procedures.  A representative of Kuehne + Nagel echoed the points made by Accenture.  ""One of the guiding principles is that ownership of the platform of the consortium will not be restricted to the founding parties,"" said the spokesperson. ""The governance model will ensure that additional partners will be able to join with equal rights and obligations.""  In all fairness, building big blockchain networks is an unprecedented business and IBM is exploring different approaches to the problem. Jerry Cuomo, Big Blue's vice president for blockchain technologies, says there are two ways you can go, in his experience: Either start out small and centralized with just a few trust anchors, or choose a more decentralized approach that involves wrangling together a large consortium and is going to take longer to get off the ground.  ""We are not sure that one is right and the other wrong,"" Cuomo told CoinDesk. ""If you start off small and centralized, the challenge will be getting the next big trust anchors on board. On the other hand, with the decentralized approach, you can have multiple competitors and their lawyers all asking questions and it's going to take some time. You've got to pick your poison,"" he said.  But if it came down to it, would TradeLens ever opt to share the IP equally among other network members in order to ensure the success of the platform?  IBM's Erdly said he was not in a position to speculate on what might or might not happen down the line, but he echoed his colleague Cuomo's point about the need to just get out there and innovate, concluding:  ""We could have spent years and years working on some industry consortium model. Or we could get started and push this thing forward.""  After this story was published, IBM supplied an additional statement from Todd Scott, the company's blockchain vice president for global trade. ""Is there value in more [carriers] joining? Absolutely,"" he said, adding:  ""The nature of the platform and its governance model – which maximizes business value and protects company data – is built so that as the ecosystem grows, the enhanced value proposition of TradeLens will grow with it.""

42402096,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OPy,1540567221,IRS Advisors Call for More Tax Guidance on Crypto Transactions,"An advisory committee to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) believes the agency should provide clearer guidelines on how cryptocurrency transactions may be taxed.  In a new report published on October 24, the Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee (IRPAC) highlighted cryptocurrencies' rise in popularity, noting that ""there has also been an equal rise in question as to the applicable tax consequences.""  The IRS has already issued one notice back in 2014 stating that cryptocurrencies are treated as a form of property for tax purposes, reiterating that position in a statement published in March ahead of the April 15 tax filing deadline.  Yet according to the report, ""many industry and tax practitioners still question other tax consequences of cryptocurrency transactions.""  The report goes on to state:  ""Can cryptocurrency be considered a specified foreign financial asset? How is the basis determined for cryptocurrency that is sold? Does broker reporting apply to cryptocurrency transactions? Therefore, IRPAC recommends that the IRS issue further guidance on the tax consequences of cryptocurrency transactions.""  A discussion further in the report explains that cryptocurrencies and their potential tax liabilities within the U.S. may be as much as $25 billion, according to a research note published by Fundstrat Global Advisors. However, this number is based on a figure of $92 billion in taxable gains for U.S.-based cryptocurrency investors.  The report adds that, according to Fundstrat, as much as 50 percent of cryptocurrency-related tax liabilities may have gone unreported – though it concedes that this number might not be correct.  ""Whether or not these estimates are accurate, they clearly underscore the need to gain more information on the operations of these protocols and to ensure that taxes that may be applicable to them are efficiently collected,"" the report continues.  The report also acknowledges that some investors may use exchanges based outside of the U.S., or invest in cryptocurrencies designed to enable anonymity so as to avoid paying taxes. It proposes cooperating with other governments and applying existing legal guidelines, including information reporting rules.  That being said, the report also notes that ""there remain significant open issues,"" which will require analysis and guidance to clarify how the term ""transaction"" may be defined.  ""Many, if not most, taxpayers will report these activities correctly if they are able to determine the implications of their cryptocurrency activities,"" the report says.

42402097,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3ORw,1540566014,A New Token Is Coming To Ethereum – And It's Fully Bitcoin-Backed,"A new token is set to be launched on the ethereum blockchain this January, one that will be backed one-for-one by the world's largest cryptocurrency.  The companies behind the initiative include decentralized exchange startups Kyber Network and Republic Protocol, as well as cryptocurrency custody company BitGo. What's more, a number of ethereum-based projects are also reporting that they will support adoption of the token once released.  These include decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges and finance-focused blockchain projects participating as ""launch members,"" such as MakerDAO, Dharma, Airswap, Gnosis, IDEX, Radar Relay, Compound, DDEX, Hydro Protocol, Set Protocol and Prycto.  Aimed at replicating the utility of bitcoin in a way that's interoperable with ethereum, the ""wrapped bitcoin"" or WBTC token will facilitate any decentralized application running on the blockchain.  Calling it ""the best of both worlds,"" CTO of BitGo Benedict Chan characterized WBTC as possessing both ""the stability of bitcoin and the flexibility of ethereum.""  Chan told CoinDesk:  ""It's very similar in some ways to how people created banknotes that represented a pound of gold. A pound of gold was heavier and it took longer to trade. You could use a note which represented a pound of gold and it was well accepted.""  Keeping full custody  In the case of WBTC, BitGo is the primary custodian in charge of holding a reserve of bitcoins to back all minted WBTC tokens in circulation on the ethereum blockchain.  And unlike other stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies, WBTC tokens will feature a full proof-of-reserves verifiable directly on the two blockchains.  ""The beauty of that is all we have to do is put up a webpage and show all the addresses that have the bitcoins … and at the same time, people will be able to check how many WBTC are in existence just by looking … on the ethereum blockchain,"" said Chan.  Apart from a bitcoin custodian, there are also registered ""merchants"" responsible for disseminating and redeeming WBTC tokens to all users. Currently listed to be the Kyber Network and Republic Protocol, merchants complete transfers of WBTC for bitcoin and vice versa, in the form of atomic swaps.  As background, atomic swaps facilitate two-way cryptocurrency trades across different blockchain platforms without any risk of one party defaulting on their end of the agreement.  This ensures that for every transfer of WBTC for bitcoin (or the other way around), reserves remain ""one-to-one backed and totally verifiable"" as highlighted by Chan.  Keeping things moving  The initiative by BitGo, Kyber Network and Republic Protocol is envisioned to be a community-driven effort.  Looking to expand services to a growing number of WBTC users, the goal is to eventually onboard several custodians and merchants in the long run.  To this end, Loi Luu, CEO of Kyber Network, emphasized that with the official launch of the WBTC token in January of next year, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) would also be activated and tasked with overseeing the ongoing development of the project.  Luu explained told CoinDesk:  ""One of the main reasons why many projects support this initiative is because there's a DAO that's going to govern the whole project including making major upgrades, adding more features, adding more merchants, even adding new custodians as well.""  As of now, what remains undetermined is the list of the companies that comprise the DAO, as well as specifications on how DAO members will propose and vote on improvements to the WBTC token.  Expected to be publicized on code-sharing platform GitHub at a later date, Luu affirmed that decentralized leadership would be a key component to the success of the WBTC token.  ""I think it couldn't be that successful if the initiative is owned by Bitgo or by Kyber [Network] or Republic [Protocol] alone,"" said Luu.

42402098,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OQx,1540562762,Four Agricultural Giants Eye Blockchain in Push to Digitize Global Trade,"The four biggest agricultural corporations plan to utilize tech such as blockchain and AI to bring the global grain trade into the digital age.  Archer Daniels Midland Company, Bunge, Cargill, and Louis Dreyfus announced in a joint press release Thursday that they are looking at ways to standardize and digitize international agricultural shipping transactions ""for the benefit of the entire industry.""  The firms initially plan to focus on automating grain and oilseed post-trade processes, which are currently largely conducted manually and are a high-cost portion of the supply chain.  Looking further ahead, the aim is to digitize other manual, paper-based processes involving contracts, invoices and payments, the release states.  One of the specific problems the companies are trying to solve is the 275 million emails being sent every year by commodity traders to process just 11,000 shipments of grain transported by sea, according to a Reuters report Friday.  Overall, the four companies aim the new tech push to usher in shorter document-processing times, better supply chain visibility and transparency, and greater overall efficiency.  While details of the planned blockchain implementation were not provided in the announcement, some of the four firms already have some history of working with the technology  In January, Louis Dreyfus completed the first agricultural commodity transaction through blockchain, claimed the firm's CEO Ian McIntosh in the release. The test ""showed the technology's capacity to generate efficiencies and reduce the time usually spent on manual document and data processing,"" he said.  While in May, Cargill teamed up with HSBC and ING to complete a trade finance transaction for a soybean export using a single blockchain system, which, too, was claimed as a world first.  Also announced in today's press release, the four agri giants are seeking wider industry participation for the modernization drive.  Soren Schroder, CEO of Bunge, said:  ""We expect an industry-wide initiative of this nature to be able to accelerate improvements in data management and business processes, and bring much-needed automation to the industry.""

The report released on Friday and conducted by IBM and OMFIF, an independent central bank think thank, examines opinions among 21 central banks between July and September on the topic of CBDCs and distributed ledger technology.  Out of the 21 respondents, 38 percent are already testing a whole CBDC for inter-bank transactions, the research find. Although a majority of the respondents are currently not active in the field, the report said ""most survey respondents believe a wholesale CBDC should be issued by the central bank.""  The report adds that by creating a digital currency equal in value to the standard unit of fiat currency, a CBDC could help remove credit risk and ""ensure stability of the token's value.""  That said, the respondents also shared concerns whether distributed ledger technology (DLT) can live up to its promise in the field, with blockchain often being touted as a way to increase efficiency in cross-border transactions, as well as to reduce costs.  ""61% of the central banks said a blockchain may not be necessary as they they observed few efficiency gains during trials, given the technology is still in early stages of development,"" the report states.  Meanwhile, 76 percent of the respondents state that they remain uncertain if ""DLT will be able to deliver on its promise, especially in areas such as regulation,"" the report said.  The report lists all the existing cases where central banks are testing various projects that use DLT in cross-border transactions, such as Project Jasper from the Bank of Canada, and Bank of Thailand's Project Khokha.  It further stated that ""none of the central bank [DLT] case studies examined included the possibility of radically overhauling their payments systems in the near future. Most are satisfied with existing RTGS [real-time gross settlement] platforms,"" adding:  ""Central banks concluded that blockchain systems must improve before they can overcome issues of scalability and speed.""

42402101,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OTu,1540552204,$100 Doldrums: Bitcoin's Price Is Stuck In Its Tightest Range Since 2017,"The bitcoin market is experiencing the lowest volatility it's seen for 18 months.  Daily volatility, as represented by the spread between the price high and low, fell below $100 on Oct. 19 and has remained under that psychological mark to date, according to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). That's the longest volatility has been so low since April 2017.  It is worth noting that BTC averaged around $1,200 in April and early May of 2017. Further, the average daily volatility during that period was $33, that is, prices moved 2.75 percent on a daily basis. Hence, back then, a $100 daily volatility reading was a normal thing.  As of now, BTC is averaging around $6,500 and the average daily volatility has dropped to $56 in the last seven days, meaning prices are moving just 0.86 percent on a daily basis. So, it seems safe to say that we are witnessing an unprecedented period of low volatility.  Such calm periods often end in a big move on either side. However, bitcoin price volatility has been falling over months now and a promised sustained shift to either bulls or bears has so far not materialized.  Under these conditions, the best thing to do is to jot down the key levels and trade the breakout.  Weekly chart  A break above the September high of $7,400 would put an end to the series of lower price highs (marked by circles). The bull breakout, if confirmed, would open the doors to a stronger rally to $10,000. On the way higher, BTC may encounter resistance at the July highs near $8,500.  Bear breakout scenario: BTC finds acceptance below $6,000  As seen in the weekly chart above, BTC seems to have carved out a bottom around $6,000. The likes of billionaire investor Novogratz have also echoed similar sentiments recently. As a result, $6,000 is the level to beat for the bears.

The court concluded by requesting that the government state its view on the matter within two weeks, The Economic Times reported Friday.

42402091,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OM2,1540540851,Zcash's Next Upgrade to Make Private Transactions 100x Lighter and 6x Faster,"Zcash's core differentiator, shielded transactions, are computationally heavy – so much so that most users and exchanges can't support it.  Heralded as a privacy breakthrough in the crypto community, shielded transactions run a type of cryptography named zk-snarks in order to obscure transaction data. But a new upgrade, predicted to activate on October 29, is being touted as a significant improvement of the usability of the protocol overall, but specifically for the use of these privacy-enabling transactions.  Dubbed Sapling, the hard fork upgrade has been the primary focus of the Zcash Company, the for-profit responsible for developing on the cryptocurrency, since its launch in 2016.  Due to the technical changes included in Sapling, exchanges and wallets will be more readily able to accept shielded transactions. Light and mobile wallets will also be a possibility – meaning that users can send anonymized transactions straight from their mobile devices.  Speaking to the gains, CTO of the Zcash Company Nathan Wilcox, told CoinDesk: ""The Sapling protocol will allow shielded transfers to be completed with about 100 times less memory and probably six or more times faster.""  It's a notable step given currently, shielded transactions are only possible for users running a full node. And with the upgrade, the team at the Zcash Company hopes it can ultimately remove transparent transactions, the non-private zcash transactions that can be damaging to zcash anonymity when used together with shielded transactions.  Eventually, this will usher in an era of ""privacy-by-default,"" according to developers.  ""We hope to see a migration toward shielded Sapling adoption, and as that migration continues we hope to transition to privacy-by-default when the time is right,"" Wilcox said.  Continuing, Wilcox said:  ""All [Sapling] is doing improving the performance and the security. Who wouldn't want that?""  Light and diversified  Saying zcash without the Sapling code changes ""is just too inefficient and too cumbersome,"" Wilcox said that the ability to support light clients will be huge for the cryptocurrency.  Light clients are those that don't store the full data from the blockchain but still have the assurance of being secure. These are typically clients working on a mobile device, which doesn't have as much storage space or computing power as laptop or desktop computers.  Still, these clients ""won't just appear during the activation day,"" Wilcox said.  Instead, this will require some development work. For example, if not coded carefully, light clients can reveal transaction information to its wallet host.  Describing that as ""dangerous,"" Wilcox said the Zcash Company is working on a proof-of-concept Sapling wallet that demonstrates how the code can be trustless.  ""Our goal is to make a light wallet that has privacy protections even against a service provider,"" he told CoinDesk. ""The goal is for us to design a whole [user experience] all around Sapling specifically and make sure that we can have the usability and the privacy work really well together.""  This wallet though might not be released to end users, but instead only serve as a guide for third-party implementations by developers.  Another feature Sapling includes that will encourage more use of shielded transactions is so-called ""diversified addresses,"" which make it easier for exchanges to support more users utilizing the transaction type. Simply put, diversified addresses allow exchanges to issue multiple addresses for the same wallet.  In the future, the upgrade may have positive implications for privacy, Wilcox said, as wallets may deploy the feature to allow users to generate multiple addresses for the same account.  ""It's the same amount of work [as one wallet], but the exchange will be supporting a million users while doing that,"" he said.  Finally, Sapling will introduce a feature named a viewing key to selectively reveal transactions. According to Wilcox, that allows users to benefit from optional transparency, but do so in a way that comes with less inherent risk.  ""If we have a privacy-by-default chain and you want to have an account that's public you can just publish the viewing key to the world,"" Wilcox said,  ""That's the world we want to move to.""  A turnstile audit  There is some subtlety involving the Sapling release, though.  In order to take advantage of the upgrade, users need to migrate funds from the earlier version of zcash, dubbed Sprout, into a new Sapling address – a move which will reveal user funds.  While the exposure of funds could come across as ""surprising"" to users, Wilcox said, it was done intentionally, in what he called a ""turnstile audit.""  ""It's actually done intentionally because there's always the possibility that the Sprout ceremony was compromised,"" Wilcox said.  Stepping back, when zcash launched Sprout in 2016, it underwent a ceremony called a ""trusted setup,"" where the zk-snarks underlying its private blockchain were generated. This has been criticized for being vulnerable to attack. The concern is, if the ceremony had been compromised, it would allow users to print nonexistent zcash tokens.  As such, the company is running this turnstile audit during the Sapling migration. Wilcox said, ""as sort of a check on that risk we want to do a sort of global audit to make sure that no counterfeiting has occurred.""  Towards this goal, the Zcash Company is releasing a migration tool and urging users to wait until this tool has been completed before migrating their funds. If users all migrate using the tool, the overall privacy will be better, because the actions of individual users are merged into one flow.  The tool won't be completed for a number of months, meaning that for now, Sapling and Sprout addresses will continue to be supported by the zcash protocol.  Sprout addresses will be retired at some point in the future.  Yet, Wilcox stressed that the eventual retirement will not impact user funds. Once retired, users will be no longer able to receive transactions on Sprout addresses – but sending outward transactions to a Sapling address will function perfectly.  Still, this doesn't mean that there are two different networks running concurrently. Users are still expected to upgrade their software to Sapling, and because of the new code's superiority, Wilcox doesn't expect there to be any problems here.  Speaking to that, Wilcox concluded:  ""It's not scalability of the base protocol, but it allows exchanges and wallets and things of that nature to support many users more efficiently.""

42402089,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OK4,1540536344,Chinese Court Rules Bitcoin Should Be Protected as Property,"An arbitration body in China has ruled that despite the country's central bank's ban on cryptocurrency trading, bitcoin should still be legally protected as a property with economic values.  The Shenzhen Court of International Arbitration published a case analysis on Thursday via WeChat, detailing its ruling on a recent economic dispute that involved a business contract relating to possession and transfer of crypto assets.  According to the case analysis, the unnamed plaintiff signed a contract agreement with the defendant, which allowed the latter to trade and manage a pool of cryptocurrencies on the plaintiff's behalf.  However, the plaintiff said the defendant failed and refused to return the cryptocurrencies after an agreed deadline. As a result, they brought the case to the arbitrator, seeking the return of the assets with interest.  The cryptocurrencies at dispute included around 20 bitcoin, 50 bitcoin cash, and 13 bitcoin diamond, worth around $493,158 combined, the plaintiff said.  While there's no specific law in China governing cryptocurrencies, the arbitrator's analysis offers a window into its thinking on the nature of the financial technology.  The arbitrator said one main argument made by the defendant was that the ban from the People's Bank of China (PBoC) on cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings essentially means crypto payments and transactions should be illegal in China. As such, the entire contract, by default, would become invalid.  Further, with the trading ban, the defendant said there was no venue to trade and send the assets to the plaintiff.  However, the arbitrator disagreed, explaining the nature of the case is about the contractual obligation for returning cryptocurrencies, which does not fall under the cryptocurrency trading or initial coin offering categories outlined in the PBoC's September 2017 ban.  The arbitrator stated that there is no law in China currently that prohibits the possession of bitcoin and its transactions between individuals. Further, it said there should be no technical difficulties in sending bitcoin as long as one has a bitcoin address and private key.  ""The Arbitration Court noticed that, after September 2017, major bitcoin exchanges operating in China at the time suspended their businesses. But technically, that fact does not prevent the defendant from sending the bitcoin and bitcoin cash at dispute to the plaintiff upon the agreed deadline,"" the arbitrator said.  The court concluded that, whether bitcoin is a legal tender or not, does not have an impact on the fact that bitcoin ownership should be protected legally based on China's contract law, adding:  ""Bitcoin has the nature of a property, which can be owned and controlled by parties, and is able to provide economic values and benefits.""  The court is one of the Arbitration Committees established in China after the country enacted a law in 1995 enabling city governments to form such entities to rule on economic disputes relating to contract issues in areas such as business, finance and real estate.

42402095,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAd3OO0,1540526441,Crypto Investing May Have Finally Met Its Tinder Match,"Crypto needs a killer app and a better sales pitch.  ""The average consumer just doesn't care about decentralization,"" Jeff Morris, Jr., an under-the-radar venture investor in the crypto space, told CoinDesk in a recent interview.  Through the fund he created last year, Chapter One Ventures, Los Angeles-based Morris has quietly gotten in on some of the buzziest crypto companies over 2017 and 2018 – CryptoKitties, Radar Relay, Blockfolio and Paradigm.  But while this side project has stayed out of the limelight, so far, his day job is a household name: Tinder. A member of the publicly traded Match Group, which controls most of the world's major dating apps, Tinder was able to pierce the public consciousness by making online dating feel more like a game.  And for all the memes and Tumblrs it has spawned, the Tinder team has a reputation as a focused product company, one with an app honed to make introductions between strangers through its innovative double opt-in approach.  Morris serves as director of product and revenue at the dating site.  And he told CoinDesk, that experience has provided a lot of lessons that help him decide what crypto companies to invest in and that the broader crypto industry might need to take heed to.  But as someone in a super successful traditional tech company, Morris' realization that the crypto industry was flush with innovative ideas didn't come right away. There wasn't much pushing him to really think heavily about crypto until his career network started shifting and displayed that he might be missing something.  He told CoinDesk:  ""Crypto didn't feel super real to me until I saw people I knew working at brand name companies going to work on crypto projects.""  And so, at the start of the year, Morris wrote on Chapter One's website that he wanted to invest in 10 crypto projects in 2018. He's already surpassed that, though, with 12 investments made, five of which are companies that haven't told the public they exist yet.  He added, ""The hardest part right now is having the discipline to say no.""  Crypto? Super Like  What's so exciting about the crypto space to Morris is that it's all built around digital goods – which he has seen the power of at Tinder.  While subscriptions lead Tinder's revenue, under the hood, the dating app is one of the most successful digital product apps of all time.  It has introduced two digital products – Tinder Boost, which increases the number of times a user gets seen for a certain amount of time, and the Super Like, which allows a user to alert another user that they're overly interested – that have been extraordinarily popular.  Indeed, Tinder dominated the iOS app store in revenue in 2017. With 3.8 million average subscribers (paying users) in the second quarter of 2018, Tinder's revenue this year will eclipse $800 million, more than double what it brought in in 2017, according to projections from its executives.  Tinder doesn't break out specific revenue numbers for Super Like or Boost, but their success shapes Morris' thinking about the promise of crypto.  While both of those products have been successful, the company had to be thoughtful about how they were introduced and rolled out so that people understood them and wanted them and so that their value didn't get diluted.  And when Morris invests in a crypto company, he wants that same amount of attention.  ""I have definitely seen the power of digital goods at Tinder in terms of creating intellectual property that adds value to consumers lives,"" he told CoinDesk. ""When I saw CryptoKitties created, I thought: This could be the start of an entirely new application of digital goods.""  And with that, Morris concluded:  ""If you can create scarcity and if you can create value for users through digital goods, the margins are great.""  In need of product people  What could hold the crypto industry back, Morris thinks, is the lack of people with specific product experience.  Sure the space is full of great engineers, he said, but it needs product professionals who know how to guide engineering teams to build things people actually want and need and make it easy for the desired user base to adopt and start using.  As such, Morris, who was already an angel investor before the fund was set up, told CoinDesk, ""I am investing in the best product teams I can find in this space who have shipped products at scale before.""  For example, he pointed to the CEO of one of his portfolio companies, Robert Leshner of Compound Finance, the crypto lending platform. Leshner previously held a product role at Postmates, a mobile-first company that facilitates local delivery and has been a solid success.  That's the kind of resume he believes the crypto industry needs so the use cases can ""persevere for a sustained period of time.""  CryptoKitties and Augur  , he said, have had their moments, but they haven't sustained interest for very long. The best crypto-adjacent product he's seen for holding users has been Brave, but it's not really its crypto product that's kept people around, it's their ad-blocking browser.  To this, he said:  ""[The crypto industry is] reaching a point where layer one is starting to require product thinkers.""  Those people, he argues, will be more focused on problem-solving and less interested in the decentralization narrative – ""decentralize all the things"" – which has been holding the industry back in his mind.  An easy example to point to, last year, during the initial coin offering (ICO) boom, a lot of companies came out with decentralized versions of well-known tech companies (such as Ebay, Netflix or Spotify). The trouble is, those companies are already solving the problems their customers needed solved, and so decentralized versions are unlikely to go very far.  Morris warned, ""It isn't going to work if you're just copying current use cases.""  Where it begins  Instead, the decentralized web needs completely new uses for the internet.  ""I'm really excited to see people enter the space who really build these things from scratch,"" Morris said. ""The internet is kind of this giant paywall … or it's set up to make you hit paywalls. When the internet is more open, it's exciting from a product point of view.""  Still, it'll be a tough sell to bring this segment of tech talent into the crypto space at the moment.  Even if a well-funded ICO can pay competitively, an elite product executive is going to find themselves leading a tiny team compared to those at a well-established company, which isn't necessarily appealing.  ""I've seen projects have an easier time recruiting engineers than A-level product talent,"" he told CoinDesk.  But, he does think, that will change with time.  According to Morris, the first really powerful digital products on the decentralized web will likely show up in gaming. That's been historically true because gamers and game companies are less conservative about technology and try new things often.  Plus, gamers already spend a significant amount of money on digital goods. Decentraland's Tony Sheng recently wrote a blog post about the power of scarcity and the incentives for game makers to adopt crypto models.  Yet, that isn't to say that only game companies are thinking about the possibilities of blockchain right now. In fact, Morris thinks it's much, much broader than that.  ""I think every major consumer tech company has probably already asked themselves: 'How seriously should we explore blockchain? How relevant is it to what we do?"" he said, adding:  ""There's probably more activity happening than we could even really understand now.""
