Terra holders have been voting on just that this week, however, in what&apos;s seemingly a first-of-its-kind event. Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon presented a new proposal to the Terra community this week, allowing LUNA holders to vote on a new five-year, $38.5M sponsorship with an unnamed team across one of the &apos;big four&apos; sports leagues in the U.S. (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL).

There exist various misunderstandings between game developers and crypto enthusiasts when it comes to NFTs. They communicate in two different languages: crypto enthusiasts often talk of revolutionary technology and social change, while game makers usually just want to have fun. This article might help you bridge that gap. Today, we will learn how everyone can work together to bring innovation and entertainment both for the targeted audience. What is NFT? The current NFT business is mostly driven by digital collectibles. Consider the non-fungible token to be a certificate, contract, or voucher that proves you own or have the rights to something specific, such as a work of art, a collectible, or perhaps admission to a concert or conference. The fact that the token is &apos;non-fungible&apos; simply means that it is separate from other forms of proof-of-ownership. It cannot be quickly exchanged for something else, unlike old money or digital tokens. When a collector purchases an NFT, he or she is essentially buying two things: A digital collectible: such as a piece of digital art, a photo, trading card, sports highlight video clip, a piece of music, etc. It could be something incredibly unusual.

42394304,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bvbQnP,1644162600,The Corporate Argument for Bitcoin,"Earlier in the week, MicroStrategy announced it purchased $25 million in bitcoin (BTC) in January. CEO Michael Saylor joined crypto podcast “UpOnly” to reveal the back story of his company’s move to accumulate 125,051 bitcoin in 2020 and 2021.  Founded in the late 1980s by Saylor, MicroStrategy (MSTR) is a publicly traded business intelligence and software provider, but it is now better known for the $4.7 billion in bitcoin it holds on its balance sheet.  You’re reading Crypto Long & Short, our weekly newsletter featuring insights, news and analysis for the professional investor. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Sunday.  Before buying all that bitcoin, it was already one of the largest independent, publicly traded companies in its industry. In 2020, its revenue was nearly $480 million and it had an enviable 8.29% EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin in the trailing 12 months before its first BTC purchase. When discussing the company's position during the “UpOnly” podcast, Saylor said, “It's profitable, that's what we are. We love it, we’ll keep doing it. But you can't really scale it.”  He then claimed that while the company was profitable, it wasn’t viable to reinvest profits into hiring sprees or increasing marketing spending. That makes MicroStrategy a cash cow that keeps collecting cash on its balance sheet.  That sounds like a good problem to have, except it becomes a problem if those accumulated dollars start diminishing in value because of inflation.  The Federal Reserve’s response in 2020 to COVID-19 with massive quantitative easing helped push the equities market to new highs, with investors favoring speculative growth stocks such as Tesla (TSLA) and tech monopolies such as Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN). Soaring stock prices allows those companies to make larger acquisitions and use their valuations to expand their operations with historically cheap capital, sending their stocks higher again, rinse and repeat.  One stock that wasn’t rallying was MicroStrategy’s. In fact, it was a laggard for several years even before the pandemic hit. From the start of 2017 to the beginning of March 2020, the S&P 500 was up nearly 31% while MicroStrategy shares fell 31%. The Federal Reserve’s pandemic QE response didn’t change things for MicroStrategy. As the S&P 500 and many growth stocks approached the highs again just three months after March 2020’s crash, MicroStrategy’s stock continued to fall.  In one of his many sailing analogies, Saylor likened his company’s performance to rowing a boat against wind blowing harder than one can row. Even worse, inflation began to pick up and the purchasing power of cash cows was falling hard against the stock market and against any assets they might buy. Thus, buying bitcoin was like turning the rowboat around and sailing with the wind.  On Aug. 11, 2020, MicroStrategy announced the purchase of 21,454 bitcoins for $250 million. While Saylor considered the purchase defensive, between Aug. 10, 2020 and the first week of 2021, the price of MSTR stock rose 263%, from $146.63 to $531.64.  Those who didn’t want a stake in a company buying bitcoin were offered a way to cash out through a $250 million cash tender offer via a modified Dutch auction, which saw around $60 million in redemptions.  Since its first bitcoin purchase, MicroStrategy hasn't slowed down. The company has now purchased 0.66% of the entire supply of bitcoin at an average price of about $30,000. The accumulation included purchases at $57,000, which now appears to be near the top for this cycle.  Saylor acknowledged that MicroStrategy has developed a reputation for buying at local tops. If the company’s bitcoin thesis is correct, buying tops will be a part of a strategy that could prove to be very profitable in the long run, even if the company takes a short-term hit on earnings. Under the generally accepted accounting principles, a company is required to take an impairment charge on a digital asset if the asset’s market price falls below the company’s purchase price, while no gain can be realized until the asset is sold. So while the numbers are deceiving, MicroStrategy took a $147 million impairment charge during last year’s fourth quarter.  More importantly, if all of its hopes pan out, MicroStrategy may maintain its purchasing power, hedging against inflation and potentially even outperforming the broader stock market. In the past week, Saylor and MicroStrategy’s chief financial officer have both assured the public that they will continue to buy bitcoin and use it in a productive way that adds more value for shareholders.  While many criticize bitcoin’s volatility and tendency to drop by 50% seemingly on a whim, Saylor appears to be unconcerned. His response to the criticism is that either you can die a slow death, facing the blows of a devaluing dollar and a soaring stock market, or you can fight. If bitcoin’s price can outpace inflation, it is a good investment as opposed to holding cash. While it may be a long shot, if bitcoin’s adoption becomes widespread in the near term, MicroStrategy will have put itself in a better position than the vast majority of public companies.",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | TRADING,Edward Oosterbaan,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2022/02/06/the-corporate-argument-for-bitcoin,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/23f7fa3a7f27825f3d2f0eba8bc378e994e63173-1920x1280.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

That is a stain on our democracy and economic structure. Today, urban, rural and native communities that continue to be locked out of centralized finance are looking to cryptocurrencies as a pathway to economic empowerment.  Recent data shows that Black and Latinx communities are driving national mainstream adoption. A Harvard-Harris poll noted that “while only 11% of white Americans report owning cryptos, 23% of Black Americans and 17% of Hispanic Americans own such assets.”  This op-ed is part of CoinDesk’s Black History Month series. Cleve Mesidor is an adviser to the Blockchain Association and leads the National Policy Network of Women of Color in Blockchain. She previously worked in Congress and served as a presidential appointee in the Obama Administration.  The more options individuals have, the more inclusive money becomes.  This is a positive trend, but it also signals a greater need for financial literacy and skills training. The rising interest in new technological instruments is an opportunity to prepare key demographics for the next-gen workforce. Federal, state and local governments must be more proactive when it comes to future-of-work strategies to position historically disadvantaged groups to compete in the global innovation economy and foster digital equity.  Black and brown communities see the value of a decentralized Web 3 that provides greater protections for users. Creative industries are leveraging non-fungible tokens (NFT) to fuel today’s more diverse, more entrepreneurial marketplace.  Need for training  Seizing on the momentum around cryptocurrencies, we should invest in training, given there are various jobs in emerging technologies that do not require coding experience or a college degree. Consumer enthusiasm in the growth of the digital asset economy has already resulted in non-technical individuals acquiring new skills.  Read more: Bitcoin Is a Way to Repair Economic Injustice: Author Isaiah Jackson  Injecting blockchain and cryptocurrency into the future-of-work toolbox is as common sense as the government working to expand access to economic opportunity. We must do everything at our disposal to dismantle barriers, build an inclusive innovation workforce, and promote entrepreneurship to spur the nation’s economy.  Emerging technologies offer alternatives to tackle financial exclusion and empower individuals to take control of their financial future. Already, fintech platforms are opening access to employees who do not have traditional bank accounts. In 2020, Square (now Block) launched a platform that enabled consumers to deposit their COVID-19 stimulus checks into their Cash App accounts to purchase bitcoin.  Paychecks for crypto  We should encourage employers to allow employees to direct deposit portions of their paycheck into cryptocurrency accounts. It may be too early to directly pay people in cryptocurrencies. Even the mayors of Miami and New York City faced challenges after announcing they wanted to be paid in bitcoin. America's working class also want options, and direct deposit can be a start. Stablecoin companies like Circle are exploring products and services that could make this future of work prospect a reality.  As adoption among communities of color deepens, there will be greater demand for trusted crypto-specific solutions that could be linked to a stablecoin to offset concerns around price fluctuations of crypto markets. The nation’s leaders need to be more intentional about tackling financial inequity and must consider decentralized options.  A federal mandate could be helpful. In November, U.S. senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) sent a letter to Treasury Department Secretary Janet Yellen and Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo urging the creation of a Presidential Commission on Financial Inclusion – a national, interagency financial inclusion strategy with the goal of providing all people with the ability to access, utilize, and reap the benefits of financial products and services.  Infrastructure bill  The federal government should also show flexibility with the implementation of bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Federal grants are often structured for traditional, centralized businesses and innovators and entrepreneurs leveraging emerging technologies often do not qualify because the requirements are so hard to meet.

There’s also a festering gender divide to address in the United States. Professional women are a casualty of COVID-19 – women of color to a large degree. And the “great resignation” is a grave economic crisis.  All solutions must be on the table!
