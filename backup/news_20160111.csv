42398837,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Pk,1452543188,Netflix Exec Suggests Streaming Video Giant Open to Bitcoin,"UPDATE (11th January 23:20 BST): This article has been updated with additional information.      Netflix CFO David Wells touched on the subject of bitcoin during a question-and-answer session at an investor event earlier this month.  Speaking at the 2016 Internet, Media and Telecommunications Conference, held on 6th and 7th January, Wells was asked about lessons Netflix learned amid problems launching payment services in Latin America.  Wells remarked that the company is still adjusting to those lessons today, as well as experiences from integrations in Europe. He said that the world of payments is in a state of evolution, and that bitcoin could be a solution to some of the issues it has faced.  Wells said:  “We'll see where we go from here in the next 10, 15 years from a payments perspective, because countries still want to hold on to their monetary policy. But [it] sure would be nice to have bitcoin, in terms of a global currency, that you could use globally.”  While Wells made no indication that Netflix is looking to integrate bitcoin, the comments are sure to spark speculation that that company is at least aware of the technology.  The event came after the announcement that the popular content streaming service would expand its area of service by 130 countries, a move revealed at the 2016 CES electronics conference.  A representative for Netflix declined to comment when reached.  Do you think Netflix will be the next online merchant to use bitcoin as a payment method?

Nairobi tech news site TechMoranhttp://techmoran.com/55211-2/ reported today that Joe Mucheru, who previously served in a regional leadership role for Google, is stepping down from BitPesa’s board and is divesting his shares in a bid to remove any conflicts of interest in his role as head of the Kenyan Ministry of Information, Communications and Technology.  Mucheru was named to the post in November, according to local reports, a move that came amid a reshuffling of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s cabinet.  Mucheru told TechMoran:  ""I’ve formally resigned from the board of BitPesa and I’ve put my shares on sale. The process is ongoing.""  According to the publication, Mucheru is also divesting an ownership stake in a home entertainment firm called Wananchi Group.  When reached for comment, BitPesa co-founder and CEO Elizabeth Rossielo confirmed the departure.  ""Joe Mucheru has been an essential part of BitPesa's story from the beginning and we wish him all the very best on this next stage in his career,"" she told CoinDesk.  BitPesa, which last year raised $1.1m in funding, is seeking to disrupt the region's remittance market by using bitcoin. The startup currently serves consumers in Kenya, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda.  However, firm is currently a party in a lawsuit involving money network M-Pesa operator Safaricom and Lipisha, a payments gateway based in Kenya.  Last month  , a judge ruled that the suit can move ahead months after M-Pesa cut off access to Lipisha and, as a result, BitPesa, citing the latter's work with digital currency.

42398853,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0hS,1452536143,Scalability Debate Continues As Bitcoin XT Proposal Stalls,"Should a certain controversial alternative to the mainstream implementation of bitcoin's code have gained traction, today might have marked a significant date in the bitcoin calendar. However, that was not to be.  As many industry observers know, the open-source bitcoin community remains engaged in a months-long struggle to determine how best to increase the capacity of the transaction network, and as of 11th January, that discussion is still ongoing.  Initially the date set by project developers Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, 11th January was to be the earliest possible time that Bitcoin XT would have begun introducing larger 8MB blocks to bitcoin users running the XT software. Others running Bitcoin Core would still process 1MB blocks, a development observers argued amounted to a split of the network.  Regardless of the proposals, there is consensus in the bitcoin community that a change is necessary because of the perceived risks to bitcoin as a payment system should daily transactions increase towards the network's 1MB limit. At this point, users would be forced to more actively choose the fee they would pay to process the transaction on the blockchain, essentially making more prominent the postage stamp charge that comes with every message.  The current block size of 1MB means that in the near future it is possible that the network could effectively become clogged up, leaving transactions delayed or even failing altogether. Such instances have already happened, as highlighted by spammers, who have in the past pushed the network to capacity.  If a sufficient number of all the bitcoin node owners had chosen to adopt XT – 75% to be precise – Bitcoin Improvement Protocol 101 (BIP101) would have become active and the block size for those running that software would also have begun to climb . This would have seen block size jump from the present 1MB up to 8MB, and doubling every two years until a block size of 8GB was reached.  But this hasn't happened. Today, just 10% or so of worldwide nodes have converted to XT. And despite support from some notable companies including Coinbase, BitPay, Circle and Blockchain, bitcoin's miners have largely not come on board.  When asked what the lack of consensus on the XT release means for bitcoin, Hearn, who now has minimal involvement with XT, told CoinDesk in an email that he still believes capacity to be a problem on the bitcoin network.  In particular, he cited the fact that bitcoin's miners have demonstrated a willingness to align with decisions made by bitcoin's Core developers, the open-source meritocracy that oversees code changes.  ""Bitcoin can't be credibly described any longer as a decentralised system. In how it operates and how much influence users and merchants have, it is indistinguishable from any other proprietary payment network,"" he argued.  Hearn is now working with blockchain startup R3, which is working to adapt the technology for use by enterprise financial institutions.  Too much, too soon?  Of course, if 75% of nodes switch to XT at some time in the future, BIP101 would still effectively kick in. But that eventuality is not looking likely, going by bot data and comments from some within the industry.  ""It appears that most miners are in agreement that BIP101 is too much too fast and tries to predict too far into the future what an appropriate block cap will be,"" said BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp. ""Bitcoin has a strong status quo – XT has shown just how difficult it is to overcome.""  Core developer BTCDrak agreed, indicating his belief that BIP 101 was ""too aggressive"", especially for miners, though this group had earlier stated they could handle 8MB blocks.  Still, he framed a lack of support as the predominant issue:  ""The XT client was rejected by miners and major business because of the lack of support, manpower and expertise to maintain and develop their software.""  In his comments, Andresen told CoinDesk that bitcoin users should be more proactive about what they want out of the software they run, statements that echo his call for the bitcoin network to support multiple implementations.  ""The community should tell developers of the software they are using what they want. If the software developers can't or won't give it to them, then they should switch software,"" he said.  Notably, Andresen suggested he is open tweaking his proposal or releasing a new BIP as necessary.  Competing solutions  Despite the differing opinions, however, it appears widely agreed that changes to the bitcoin network's transaction capacity should take place.  To supporters of such changes, it's less of a question of if it will happen, and more a question of how and when.  Other proposals include a method called 'segregated witness' (popularly shorted to 'SegWit') first proposed by Bitcoin Core maintainer and Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille.  This would could make transactions appear smaller to current nodes on the network, in theory making a 1MB block become equivalent to 4MB (although in practice actually more like a maximum of 2MB). The measure, roughly equivalent to reorganizing the closet as opposed to buying a bigger one, has attracted support since debuting at Scaling Bitcoin Hong Kong last year.  Yet another solution, a so-called '2-4-8' plan, has drawn interest from supporters like BTCC, a China-based bitcoin mining pool and exchange, as a more modest means to raise the block size limit.  However, it remains possible that both solutions could be pursued simultaneously due to the different approaches the proposals take to solving the issue.

42398838,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0Sh,1452529808,Why Bitcoin Needs 21 Inc to Deliver in 2016,"You may not have heard the name Balaji Srinivasan, but in 2016 his name could very well come to be synonymous with another more infamous 'b' word – bitcoin.  Since mid-2015, Srinivasan has been the acting CEO of bitcoin’s best funded startup, 21 Inc, a $116m technology firm that is in the midst of radically reinventing itself as a platform for developers and consumer services.  While the company has inarguably struggled to communicate its larger vision, the idea is perhaps more simplistic than is suggested by the grand and technical terminology that often accompanies the company’s sparse messages.  Though it’s sure to be debated, 21, it seems, is seeking to do nothing less than reimagine how the Internet works, effectively using the ability of the bitcoin network to convert electrical energy into money as a way to monetize online attention.  Its signature product, the 21 Bitcoin Computer, is perhaps best considered a prototype of what’s to come. A mining chip with a Raspberry Pi attached (and some other bells and whistles), it invites developers to build products and services that make use of its ability to provide a steady stream of bitcoin to owners, and demand bitcoin from others.  It’s easy to conceive how such a product could be powerful at scale should consumer devices come to be embedded with bitcoin, as common as other protocols like Bluetooth and near-field communication (NFC).  Rather than monetize through advertising, in a world where devices are constantly generating money, a media platform like CoinDesk could instead allow users to pay for access by opening a browser and directing the proceeds of the power expenditure on their computer or smartphone to our accounts.  That's a truly compelling idea. So, why aren't the merits of this more widely publicized and debated?  That answer is perhaps more complicated, and if the industry is to succeed on its original vision, it’s safe to say this will need to change in the months ahead.  This op-ed is at once a prediction and a challenge. Less a firm conviction than an attempt to showcase what could be at stake if it doesn’t come to pass.  Blockchain over bitcoin  Even those casually familiar with the bitcoin industry will be aware that public interest has shifted from digital currency to distributed ledgers, from bitcoin to the blockchain.  Rather than a currency, the latest wave of proponents of the technology see bitcoin not as a coming Internet for financial services, but as a platform that serves as an example of how distributed digital networks could be constructed with similar building blocks.  The change is being led by enterprise financial firms who, seeking to cut costs and stay competitive, view the bitcoin blockchain as a prototype, the first distributed ledger to operate at scale.  As articulated by a UBS executive at a recent industry event, a distributed ledger, even one operating on a somewhat closed basis, could allow an enterprise financial company to unite its tens or hundreds of ledgers across subsidiaries into one consolidated platform.  How this affects the bitcoin industry is that venture capital now appears to be allocating more resources to these firms, creating a climate where new digital currency companies are being started up less frequently and being less enthusiastically capitalized than in 2014.  In short, the bitcoin vision of a democratized financial system is being partly deprived of its ability to grow due to the increasing cost of starting a business. While commentators and industry proponents tout $1bn invested in the industry, as put forth by careful observers like R3’s Tim Swanson, it’s clear that the money in the space isn’t moving in one direction.  21, in this context, appears more than a bitcoin company, but rather one of the few startups with the concept and the resources to restore the original vision of many of the ecosystem’s earlier generations of entrepreneurs sought to build – an open platform for a new generation of consumer financial products that was not solely an asset class or bookkeeping system.  An overlooked loophole is that bitcoin regulation to date has largely ignored bitcoin mining, meaning 21, and by extension its users, don’t face the stringent costs inherent in more familiar business models, as of yet.  In this light, 21 could come to be the preferred platform for developer entrepreneurs.  Momentum over definition  Still, much of the criticism against 21 seems to focus on two fair points: that the company is overambitious or lacks a clear idea of what it’s trying to achieve. Others just don’t think bitcoin will ever grow beyond what it is today or will simply fail entirely – and there’s merit to those arguments as well.  However, those close to the company have justified their uncertain vision by focusing on how they hope to empower other creators.  In interviews earlier this year with The Wall Street Journal, 21 compared its Bitcoin Computer to Netscape, the earliest Internet browser, and key investors sought to stress one theme – that it wasn’t clear back then what exactly people would build with the now everyday technology.  In this context, it’s clear why 21 deserves the spotlight that, if they have until now avoided, they will most likely be thrust into over the course of this year.  The fact of the matter is that, many current bitcoin products are effectively weaker versions of existing financial products built with a new technology. It’s challenging to conceive, for example, why someone would use a bitcoin debit card or online account, if they already have existing debit cards and bank accounts that work well enough to meet their needs.  A revolutionary technology not only demands revolutionary new products, it’s a novelty without them. 21 may lack definition, but that’s precisely why it holds so much potential.  Even I have trouble conceiving what will be built with the 21 Bitcoin Computer. But, I do know that if there’s a chance to build a truly unique new consumer product, it increasingly appears that the only platform where it can built is 21’s.  Stepping up to the plate  One of the more frustrating aspects of covering the industry to date, has been that, for all its vision, 21 has so far seemed unwilling to take the reins as the leader in the industry.  Srinivasan, in particular, while often verbose on Twitter, seems more comfortable revealing his ideas to a small subset of followers than on investing in refining this message and communicating it to the masses.  And to be sure, Srinivasan has some truly interesting theses on the technology.  At one of his first public appearances, for example, he argued that the “price of bitcoin” is one of the most misunderstood metrics, because quite simply, the very idea is flawed.  One bitcoin, or 1 BTC, is no more a solid unit than $1 is one hundred pennies. Therefore, the true worth of $1 is not in the dollar itself, but in how much each penny is worth. Raise the value of a penny, he seemed to argue, and in tandem, the price of any larger unit will rise.  In this context, the company’s approach to reworking the essential contract of bitcoin mining, effectively controlling supply by partitioning small amounts of bitcoin, seemingly at its own discretion to device users, takes on new power. Controlling or even managing supply can be a dangerous thing, especially when that bitcoin is meant to subsidize smartphones in Africa.  As for what I’ve just written, however, it could all be dismissed as mere conjecture, precisely because these ideas have not been allowed to be discussed in a public forum.  Today, bitcoin is mired in debates and the path forward seems unclear. 21 certainly doesn’t and won’t have all the answers.  But, what the industry does need is a charismatic young visionary who can bring the tech to its full potential and help consumers see its utility.  There has been, and will always be, a relationship between technology and individuals. When we think computers, we think Bill Gates, we think Michael Dell, we think Steve Jobs. Bitcoin has no such face to its name.  If the Internet comparison is to be believed, bitcoin, in short, needs its visionary. And right now, it seems, there’s only one man with enough money and vision to fill that role.

42398848,DbF8Q09kuKX2XWBxAbh0bY,1452509031,Bill Seeking Bitcoin Ban Reaches Russian Legislature,"The long-uncertain legal environment for bitcoin in Russia took a step forward toward clarity this December as lawmakers submitted a new draft bill to the Duma – Russia's legislative assembly – that would effectively ban the use of digital currencies like bitcoin domestically.  The development may not be surprising to industry observers, as talks of a bitcoin ban in Russia have been rife in the news for over a year amid broader concerns of capital flight. However, the latest bill is perhaps the most concrete step taken by government officials to date to crack down on the emerging technology's expansion.  The Russian Ministry of Finance, which oversees policy and legislation for the industry, has repeatedly indicated its opposition against allowing the use of digital currencies as an alternative to government-issued money, although they have clarified that blockchain applications of the technology are not viewed so harshly.  Still, the latest draft appears to make good on the finance ministry's threats, including language that would effectively ban the issue and exchange of ""money surrogates"", a definition under which digital currencies are captured, should it be passed.  The action follows the Finance Ministry's release of a draft bill in early 2015 that did not make it as far as the Duma. Like that initiative, the latest outlined proposed prohibition, if approved, would likely see those who break the new laws end up in jail.  The situation has effectively put the nation's bitcoin industry in a state of limbo, with some companies fleeing abroad to more favourable regulatory regimes, even as more tech-forward payments firms like Qiwi and Yandex have sought to push the discussion about the benefits of exploring the technology.  Notably, however, the severity of the penalties have been lessened, though an analysis of bill suggests most use cases for digital currency would be criminalised should the law be enacted.  Fine-based deterrent  A translation of the new Russian-language draft provided to CoinDesk by local news service Forklog includes several clauses that would effectively make many uses of digital currencies liable for severe ""administrative penalties"".  These would range from 20,000 rubles ($265 at press time) to a maximum of 5 million rubles ($66,264), along with confiscation of the items responsible for the violation.  The level of fine would depend on the type of violation and the status of the party responsible, increasing through individual, entrepreneur, Russian official and legal entity.  Money surrogates in the text are defined as ""objects of property rights, including those electronic, intended for usage as exchange and/or payment means issued in the Russian Federation, not considered as official payment means in the legislation of the Russian Federation"".  The draft also makes clear that even such ""objects"" that are considered legal elsewhere will not be allowed within Russia – presumably taking into account their potential official acceptance in other countries.  A clause titled ""Malevolent issuance of money surrogates"" infers the law would penalise those who disseminate surrogate money (potentially including miners) who deal with either Russian individuals or with international customers over the Internet.  It states that an ""individual or entity issuing money surrogates ... in case such activity incorporates no criminally punishable acts"" would invoke an administrative penalty.  The clause covers issuance of money surrogates ""performed with application of information and telecommunication networks, or committed within more than one subject of the Russian Federation"".  Exchanges, some software targeted  Elsewhere in the text, in a section titled ""Circulation of money surrogates"", a number of other important potential areas of digital currency use are identified. For example, penalties would be handed out to those who pay for goods with money surrogates rather than an approved, government-issued currency.  Acting as an exchange that trades money surrogates with fiat currencies is ruled out, as the text states that the ""purchase and sale of money surrogates for the currency of the Russian Federation or a foreign currency"" is prohibited.  What's more, even giving digital currency away would not be permitted, according to the text.  The clause ""Assistance in money surrogates circulation"" would seek to ban the creation or distribution software that facilitates the issuance of money surrogates. It states that ""manufacturing for distribution purposes, or release of software, sufficient and necessary for issuance of money surrogates"" would result in financial penalties.  Mining clients and wallet apps could, in theory, fall under this definition.  Furthermore, it seems even merely promoting digital currencies or advertising related services in the general media and online could draw scrutiny, as one clause cites the ""intended distribution of information sufficient and necessary for issuance of money surrogates in media and information and communication networks"".  However, in a small reprieve, distribution of information at ""dedicated events and in dedicated publications"" would not be not deemed an administrative violation, allowing at least, for the production of digital currency conferences or dedicated media within Russia.  Impact unknown  As for the bill's implications for Russia's cryptocurrency communities, the local consensus on measure is not clear.  As detailed in CoinDesk, some startups have taken a ""wait-and-see"" approach to regulation, citing the Central Bank's positive statements about the technology, as well as statements indicating that Russia's Interior Ministry and President Vladimir Putin intend for this agency to play a role in determining policy on the matter.  As yet, a consensus on the probability that the law will pass could not be determined.  Local payments companies, financial industry groups and law firms engaged with the technology have so far been unresponsive to requests for further clarity on their view of the bill.
