42425678,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewZh,1400017825,Canada's Vault of Satoshi to Test Cloud Mining Market,"Toronto-based digital currency exchange Vault of Satoshi has announced it plans to launch a cloud mining service beta test.  The Managed Mining Contracts program offers one-year ASIC rentals, the company said in a 13th May post on reddit. Hashing power can be purchased in packages starting at 10 gigahashes (10 Gh/s), which cost $70 for the year.  Notably, VoS will also host rented bitcoin nodes for every 150 Gh/s plan sold. The company plans to deploy the nodes in data centers in Europe, the US and Southeast Asia, among other regions.  VoS director of marketing Adam Cochran told CoinDesk the company has already begun receiving requests to join the beta group. He framed the company’s decision to launch the cloud mining and node hosting service as a way to reinvest revenue while supporting the broader bitcoin network, adding  “We believe in cryptocurrency, and we want to do our best to make services that are transparent, reliable and built with a sense of security.”  Plan outlines  VoS is pitching the beta test as a way for people to invest in bitcoin mining without having to purchase hardware.  In its announcement, VoS outlined plan costs from 10 Gh/s to 150 Gh/s, with discounts varying depending on the order. The company said that contracts worth more than $10,000 per year could qualify for additional price reductions.  Customers should note that VoS reserves the right to change prices without notice, and that customers can avoid price fluctuations by signing multi-year contracts.  VoS is accepting payments via credit card, PayPal, wire transfer or BTC, LTC and DOGE. Customers of the exchange may opt to use their on-site balances to make payments.  Cloud-mining boom  Given the high entry costs for consumers looking to mine digital currencies, cloud mining offers a potential alternative that provides hashing power without the need to purchase mining infrastructure.  Recent news suggests that the market is moving to provide greater cloud mining services to interested parties.  This week, bitcoin mining ASIC processor and systems manufacturer CoinTerra announced that it would offer hosted mining contracts ranging from 200 GH/s to 1 petahash (PH/s). Like VoS, CoinTerra added cloud mining as an additional option to its existing services.  Further, earlier this month, cloud mining host CloudHashing announced a merger with HighBitcoin, an enterprise ASIC hardware designer, forming a new firm called PeerNova. The new company will continue to offer cloud mining services.

42425685,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewhh,1400015827,Bank of Canada: Bitcoin Adoption Could Destabilize Global Finance,"The Bank of Canada has issued new statements on bitcoin and digital currencies as part of its annual spring review.  Perhaps most notably, the central bank speculated that the stability of the financial industry could be threatened by bitcoin and its potential risks, should it develop into a widely used means of payment, saying:  ""There could be potential risks to overall ﬁnancial stability if Bitcoin became a signiﬁcant means of payment and the Bitcoin system remained unstable.""  The comments came as part of wider report on digital currency platforms – such as Amazon Coins, Facebook Credits and World of Warcraft gold – that ultimately found that these financial instruments should monitored by central banks, though they are unlikely to become a more widely used method of payment.  The statements follow earlier comments from the central bank that suggested it believes it is still too early to predict whether decentralized digital currencies like bitcoin will enter the mainstream.  Consumer risk  The Bank of Canada used to the report to reiterate the risk consumers face when using bitcoin due to the ongoing volatility in its price, as well as issues with major bitcoin exchanges:  ""In particular, given that digital currencies such as bitcoin are not regulated and do not have a centralized issuer, users bear all of the risks themselves and have no legal recourse should they wish to reverse a bitcoin transaction.""  Potential benefits  The central bank did acknowledge that the bitcoin network has the potential to improve financial services in some key areas, noting that bitcoin offers lower transaction costs than credit cards as it removes traditional financial intermediaries.  Still, it suggested that even in areas like the remittance market – where many experts believe bitcoin could benefit underbanked consumers, the volatility and security issues associated with bitcoin outweigh the potential benefits.  Despite the warnings, however, Canadian entrepreneurs remain undeterred. For more on how Canada is leading the world in the development of bitcoin ATMs, read our most recent report.

42425683,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewdh,1400011264,"Japan to Crack Down on Bitcoin Crime, Court Industry Investment","The government of Japan has announced that it intends to increase oversight of illegal transactions that are carried out using digital currencies like bitcoin.  The news comes amid increasing fears in the country that criminal organizations are using bitcoin for money laundering and drug dealing, according to a new report from Kyodo News International.  Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is now expected to set in motion a plan for how it will monitor illicit trade involving digital currency, working with other government agencies such as the Financial Services Agency and National Police Agency in the process.  Notably, domestic law enforcement officials completed their first bitcoin-related drug arrest last week when a 38-year-old citizen was arrested for allegedly importing illegal stimulants.  Defining bitcoin  Kyodo News reports that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration also plans to issue a formal classification for digital currencies.  Under the proposal, bitcoin and other similar technologies would be labeled as a new type of ""value-added electronic record"" - similar to credit card and electronic money records, not as a currency.  Government officials further suggested that they will not be seeking to apply capital gains taxes to bitcoin transactions, as the US has done, though it may apply taxes to purchases.  Seeking investment  In addition to its increased oversight of potential criminals, Japanese officials indicated that they will put off plans to regulate or otherwise introduce new rules on the domestic trading of digital currencies.  Kyodo News states that while Japan has no laws governing digital currencies, many legislators believe such market controls are needed. However, the suggestion of regulation may not be hostile, as the report says Japan is considering courting digital currency investment in a bid to bolster its overall economy.  The news notably follows speculation that Japan would seek to introduce new market controls following the demise of major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, the Japan-based business that filed for bankruptcy in February.  At the time, Japanese officials suggested they would look to pursue bitcoin regulation as part of an international effort.

42425686,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewjh,1400003459,US Government Report: China is Threat to Global Bitcoin Economy,"China’s crackdown on bitcoin threatens to undermine the industry's global economy, according to a new US government report.  Drawing a contrast between the actions of domestic authorities to ""investigate and regulate bitcoin without restricting its use"" and the recent, restrictive steps taken by the Chinese government, the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission report concluded:  ""If Chinese regulators successfully prevent Chinese users from accessing bitcoin, the global bitcoin market will face continued price declines, significantly decreased trading volumes and threats to its legitimacy.""  Continued uncertainty  In recent weeks, the regulatory environment in China has shifted, with Chinese banks closing the accounts of bitcoin businesses and the government ordering restrictions on digital currency coverage in the media coverage.  While last year’s rapid uptake of bitcoin in China helped take the price to record levels, this year the country has been a source of uncertainty for the bitcoin economy, depressing prices to around the $400-$500 mark.  During this time, Chinese regulators have displayed little transparency about their intentions, the report finds:  ""The true attitude of China’s regulators toward bitcoin is characteristically ambiguous; while PBoC pressures banks and bitcoin companies behind closed doors, its officials claim openly that China cannot ban bitcoin.""  Bitcoin's next China  Although the crackdown has had an impact on China's bitcoin economy, locations like Hong Kong have benefitted from the Chinese government’s actions.  Hong Kong has a ""wide regulatory latitude and tech-friendly atmosphere"", the report notes, arguing that it is the ""most suitable transplant location ahead of Singapore and South Korea"".  Still, the Chinese bitcoin economy may be down, but it’s certainly not out. Major exchanges like Huobi and OKCoin, for example, are working to bolster the perception of bitcoin in China, while the broader ecosystem has taken steps to ensure exchanges are not the target of further government action.  The question now is how much farther the Chinese government will go to deter bitcoin businesses.

42425684,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewfh,1399997825,$50k in Dogecoin Rumoured to Have Been Lost in Recent Hack,"Online dogecoin storage provider DogeVault.com has been compromised by hackers, according to an official announcement from the service.  The site shut down as a result of the attack, which also saw the destruction of all of the service's data. As a result, DogeVault is encouraging users not to transfer any funds to its wallet addresses while the attack is under investigation, and explained:  ""We are currently in the process of identifying the extent of the attack and potential impact on users' funds. This involves salvaging existing wallet data from an off-site backup.""  DogeVault has indicated that it will issue an additional statement on its findings within 24 to 48 hours of the initial post.  The overall loss of funds sustained by the site is as-yet unknown, though The Cryptocurrency Times has estimated that as many as 111m DOGE (nearly $51,000 at press time) could have been lost in the theft.  Community reaction  The r/dogecoin subreddit was quick to react to the news, with users speculating on funds lost in the hack. Reddit user igi00 suggested a personal loss of more than 2m DOGE (roughly $918.56 at press time), while heri93 estimated a loss of approximately 50,000 DOGE ($22.96).  Other forum posters used the news to highlight best practices for storing digital currencies such as dogecoin, including using cold wallet storage, while also sharing theories as to how the attack was perpetrated.  Next steps  First uncovered on 11th May, the DogeVault team says it will now look to recover existing wallet data from an off-site backup. DogeVault further suggested it would be investigating potential attack vectors – the paths by which the alleged hackers would have used to gain access to one of its computers or network servers.  At press time, DogeVault had not responded to a request for more information on the investigation and whether it will seek to reimburse site users for their losses.  Repayment plans have become a popular option for digital currency services that are compromised by attacks.  Even black market websites are in on the act. Most recently, leading online black market Silk Road 2.0 reported that 50% of its users have been repaid following a February attack that saw the loss of roughly 4,500 BTC.

42425695,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewxh,1399993282,Kraken's Jesse Powell: Banks are the Biggest Hurdle for Bitcoin Businesses,"Even though Kraken is based in the US and facilitates exchanges between a number of different cryptocurrencies, its customer base is decidedly euro-driven.  In fact, according to BitcoinAverage, Kraken has over 50% of the EUR/BTC market. That makes it the largest player in that trading pair.  Due to regulatory issues in the US (which has 50 different states with 50 different ideas about money transmission), Kraken leans on its European banking partnership with Germany-based Fidor.  Even with that geographic bent, being San Francisco-based has had benefits for Kraken, and, in March, the company closed a $5m Series A funding round from Hummingbird Ventures.  CoinDesk sat down with Kraken CEO Jesse Powell to talk about the challenges of running a cryptocurrency exchange in terms of banking, regulation and how decisions are made for adding altcoins.  Impact of Mt. Gox  While some may associate the name Kraken with spiced rum or perhaps its monstrous fictional namesake, Powell says that he had owned the domain Kraken.com for years, having designs on using the name for something. However, he didn't know exactly what it would be.  In the beginning, Kraken's parent company, Payward, was planning to provide a bitcoin wallet service, like Coinbase.  Powell's experience in 2011, though, helping out Mt. Gox with its early problems in Japan, a story that he details here, motivated him to build a robust cryptocurrency exchange.  ""We’ll probably never get back to doing the Payward wallet,"" he said. ""[We'll] probably just focus on Kraken. We’re trying to rebrand everything to just Kraken.""  Do one thing and do it well has become the strategy for Kraken, said Powell:  ""We’d prefer just to be laser focused on being the best exchange and let other people deal with payments between people.""  FinCEN and Kraken's focus  Powell's trip to Tokyo in order to help Mt. Gox bounce back from security intrusion that severely affected bitcoin influenced Kraken's move to into the exchange business. Since the company was initially formed in 2011, though, regulatory issues have shifted. According to Powell:  ""We when started, it wasn’t clear that it would be a problem to operate in the United States. We didn’t think exchanging was money transmission, until the FinCEN guidance in March 2013.""  Kraken's exchange platform debuted in early 2013. For many months, users could only trade with 'play' money. But the strategy helped the company work out bugs in the system early on. By the time of its official launch last September, Kraken had better knowledge about running a robust exchange:  ""We wanted to find the problems before losing real money. It was important to us to have a really lengthy test phase.""  Kraken currently makes all of its money on exchange fees, which means it is dependent on the price and volume of coins traded in order to profit.  Powell said, though, that the startup is looking at other ways to make money, adding:  ""We’re exploring some other ideas for revenue. Obviously we’re serving a dual purpose for many users, people are using us like a bank. A lot of people just put their money in and leave it there.""  Regulatory enforcement  Kraken's focus on European markets is based on problematic regulatory compliance issues within the US.  The exchange only does business in a handful of US states because of the different compliance requirements from state to state. ""People in some states may miss out on an opportunity to get into bitcoin,"" if something isn't done to ease the rules, said Powell.  At this point, there haven't been any issues that have cropped up against exchanges or wallets in the United States. ""There’s been no enforcement action yet, whatsoever, as far as I’m aware, against any of the exchanges,"" he explained.  However, that could change if states take action against an exchange or a wallet provider:  ""The laws are consumer protection laws. But until [people start complaining,] they just don’t care.""  The biggest problem, however, comes in the form of banking for startups that want to get involved in bitcoin.  ""Even if you are not getting enforced against by the regulators or even if you have your licences, it does not guarantee you a bank account. The banks are the biggest hurdles for these businesses,"" said Powell, adding.  ""Our approach really has been really to do whatever it takes to get the bank comfortable with giving us an account. First part is to get bank accounts; second part is to actually service customers.""  Bitcoin and banks  While at the beginning of 2014 there was some promising news with Wells Fargo and Bank of America both publicly looking at bitcoin, Powell said that Mt. Gox's disintegration has dealt a serious blow to the US cryptocurrency market, with banks now causing bitcoin-related companies difficulty in obtaining accounts.  This environment shows how much banking really has control over the business climate, he explained:  ""It’s crazy that in the United States you don’t have a right to a bank account, but you can’t really operate a business without a bank account.""  It's impossible to run a business with just paper money these days, a scenario that Powell has trouble trying to envision as feasible in 2014. The idea of running a business by mailing around what he described as ""100% stacks of cash"" is not really possible.  Legitimate businesses have to use banks – something that, if given a choice, the feds would rather prefer over a purely cash economy:  ""I think that the government would say that actually: 'we’d prefer that you have a bank account'.""  Picking altcoins  Kraken now trades bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, namecoin, ven and ripple's XRP. Powell says that Kraken is interested in adding peercoin at some point, as well.  It takes careful study of the cryptocurrency's volume and differentiating aspects to decide if an altcoin has long-term potential for addition to Kraken, Powell explained, adding:  ""Peercoin is one that we would like to do, if we get the time for it. We do namecoin. If there’s something interesting about it, like namecoin, we might do it.""  Many people don't realize that adding an altcoin to the exchange takes effort. Therefore, for Kraken, new coins have to be scrutinized, according to Powell:  ""Some of these are just pump and dumps, and it costs a lot of dev time to put these coins in [to the exchange]. And I think it says something to people, that we start trading it. So we want to be careful what we put our name on.""  The problem for exchanges that support altcoins is that the bandwagon can often leave a coin (and thus users) behind rather quickly. For an exchange doing its best to follow regulatory and banking standards to the point of even providing public audits, scams are a problem.  It's something that Powell, and Kraken as a company, is ultimately concerned about for the community's sake:  ""There’s this [altcoin] hype in the beginning. And all the mining effort will go to [a coin], and there is all this support. A week later, after the pump, you get the dump. Everyone’s out and you’re on to the next coin,"" he said.

42425690,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewrh,1399986186,Bitcoin Embassy Launches In Poland’s Capital Warsaw,"A new bitcoin embassy was launched in Poland’s capital Warsaw on 12th May with the aim of promoting the digital currency in the country and fostering innovation.  Located on Krucza 46 street, right in the city centre, the embassy is a stone's-throw from the Warsaw Stock Exchange and Poland’s central bank – two of the most powerful financial institutions in the Polish economy.  Inside the newly furbished, contemporary office space stands bitcoin mining hardware. On one of the walls hangs a triple clock showing local time in three cities: Montreal, Tel Aviv and Warsaw.  ""These are the first three cities in the world where bitcoin embassies were opened,” explained Piotr Hetzig, chief executive of Bitcoin Embassy Warsaw (pictured above), adding:  ""Our bitcoin embassy is the first institution of its kind in Europe, and this is a result of the rapidly developing Polish bitcoin scene.”    Europe's first bitcoin embassy  According to estimates by Krzysztof Piech, PhD, an economist, bitcoin researcher and lecturer at the Warsaw School of Economics (SGH), Poland-based bitcoin miners rank 10th globally in term of their output.  So, in certain circles, bitcoin is certainly booming. However, the population at large still remains largely uneducated about the advantages of digital currencies.  Asked about the reasons for launching the embassy, Piotr Hetzig said the aim is to establish a meeting place for both bitcoin enthusiasts and those who have heard about the cryptocurrency, but wish to find out more about bitcoin before they consider making any investments.  ""Many people, especially the younger generations, read about bitcoin online, but we also want to reach out to those who are used to more traditional forms of commerce and information,” he told CoinDesk. ""We understand this, and we will be happy to answer all possible questions related to bitcoin.”  Bitcoin services  For those already involved in digital currency mining and trading, the embassy is offering a wide range of services.  ""We will host [training sessions], meetings and various activities for the local bitcoin scene. Also, we will offer bitcoin mining hardware for sale for those [wanting] to upgrade their gear,” Hetzig said.  One of the most important missions of the initiative is to foster increased trust in the digital currency, he said, adding""  ""We want to host an open and honest conversation on bitcoin.”  The bitcoin embassy is also in talks with one of the leading bitcoin ATM manufacturers.

42425679,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewTh,1399975245,BitPay Raises $30 Million in Record-Breaking Bitcoin Funding Round,"Atlanta-based bitcoin merchant processor BitPay has officially raised $30m in Series A funding in the largest-ever financing round for a bitcoin company.  The round was led by Index Ventures, and included Yahoo founder Jerry Yang's AME Cloud Ventures, Felicis Ventures, PayPal founder Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Horizons Ventures, RRE Ventures, Virgin Galactic's Sir Richard Branson and TTV Capital.  As part of the deal, Index Ventures' Jan Hammer and noted bitcoin ecosystem investor Jimmy Furland will join BitPay’s Board of Directors.  Rapid growth  In an interview with CoinDesk, BitPay CEO Tony Gallippi framed the funding as both a validation of the explosive growth his company has seen over the past year and a way for BitPay to continue its success into 2015 and beyond.  For example, the company will aggressively expand its team, tripling its work force by adding 70 jobs across its global offices.  ""We have to continue to make our product more scalable,"" said Gallippi. ""What works for 1,000 merchants does not work for 100,000 merchants. We’ve got to continue to add new features to the platform, we’ve got to continue to build things that our merchants are asking for.""  BitPay's $30m round comes amid an increasingly active year for bitcoin startups. Fellow merchant processor and consumer bitcoin wallet provider Coinbase raised $25m in December, while wallet and secure storage platform Xapo secured $20m in March.  BitPay previously raised $2m in funding as part of a seed round led by Founders Fund in May 2013.  As of January, BitPay reported that it is now adding more than 1,000 merchants to its network each week. Furthermore, the company processed more than $100m in bitcoin payments in 2013.  International expansion  One of the chief goals of the funding, Gallippi said, will be for BitPay to strengthen its commitment to furthering bitcoin adoption abroad.  Gallippi noted that one of the reasons it chose to work with Index Ventures was the firm's worldwide reach given its offices in Geneva, London and San Francisco, saying:  ""When we look at our product, clearly it's a global product. We're starting to get some traction in Europe – I'd say Europe is about 30% of our business right now – and we felt that it's going to be really important to add more strategic investors in Europe.""  The BitPay CEO said the appeal of Index Ventures extended to its startup funding approach, adding: ""We really felt they were the kind of investors that were going to roll up their sleeves and help us, and that's why we ultimately chose them.""  Growing the team  Another noteworthy development is that BitPay is seeking to dramatically expand its team. Gallippi noted that here, too, BitPay plans to operate strategically by adding experience where it's most needed – on its developer team:  ""It all revolves around software development: back end, front end, tools for our internal staff to use. Of the 70 jobs, maybe 40 to 50 of them are going to be software developers.""  The next biggest area for growth, he continued, will be on its international sales team.    ""We now have a head of business development in Latin America,"" he said. ""We've got a head of business development in Europe, and we're going to be looking to add more resources to North America, South America and Europe to build our business and acquire more merchants.""    Opportunity for investors  Gardiner Garrard, co-Founder and managing partner at TTV Capital, told CoinDesk that his firm's investment marks its first foray into the digital currency ecosystem.  However, Garrard is confident in BitPay given what he stressed was the proven effectiveness of the company's underlying business model, saying:    ""We are a believer long-term in the prospect and potential of bitcoin, and we think BitPay has the best model for having success of that ecosystem by enabling the people who are going to benefit the most from having access to this form of currency.""            This validation is notable as Garrard said that his firm is still evaluating bitcoin, and that he believes it will serve as an addition to the payments ecosystem rather than a replacement for some time.  Adding services  Founded in May 2011, BitPay quickly expanded to become the largest merchant bitcoin payment processor, growing its network to more than 30,000 merchants currently.  However, the company has also added additional services. This February, the company released Bitcore, an open-source project for developers, while also making improvements to its QR code technology in a bid to reduce friction at the checkout.  To Gallippi, the funding is a validation of the work his team has done over the last 12 months. Comparing his company now to its state one year ago, he said:  ""[Last May], we had maybe 4,000 merchants. Today, we have over 40,000, so we're 10 times bigger from an overall customer perspective. When you look at the transactions we're processing, our volumes are about 10 times what they were last year.""  He added that, given the opportunity available in the bitcoin market, he'd like to achieve similar growth by next May.  Disclaimer: CoinDesk founder Shakil Khan is an investor in BitPay.

42425677,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyIewXh,1399971680,Scottish Tech Store CeX Drops UK Pound for Bitcoin,"Technology exchange and retailer CeX is making waves in the United Kingdom’s bitcoin ecosystem this week, launching a bitcoin-only payments initiative, as well as Scotland's first bitcoin ATM.  CeX has added bitcoin payments to its website, according to a post on the company’s blog yesterday. To commemorate the initiative, the retailer is undertaking a series of projects, which includes the ATM launch at its Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow, location.  The ATM, built by Lamassu, will charge 0% commission on bitcoin transactions, well below the rate of other similar machines in the UK, to entice shoppers unfamiliar with the young currency.  A two day-long 'pound-free zone' will also feature at the Glasgow store from 13th to 15th May, whereby customers will only be able to transact in bitcoin when buying or selling their electronics.  Scottish Independence  A CeX representative told CoinDesk that the project is, in spirit, connected to Scotland’s bid for financial and economic independence from the broader United Kingdom, saying:  “The trial is turning the Scottish high street into a bitcoin laboratory, highlighting alternative forms of currency should Scotland vote 'yes' in the forthcoming referendum.”  Eric Benz from the UK Digital Currency Association hailed the store's plan as ""forward-thinking"", adding that Scotland’s appetite for bitcoin is big and ""growing exponentially"" everyday.  He also noted that the currency has potential as a highly-political tool:  ""Taking a step forward and promoting this incredible new technology would [...] allow Scotland to possibly become one of the leading financial technology countries in the world.""  Budding growth for bitcoin  The CeX bitcoin launch represents some of the most significant news for bitcoin to come out of Scotland. However, there have been other bitcoin-related developments in the region that have introduced local residents to the digital currency.  In January, local bistro Brooklyn Cafe, situated in Glasgow’s Shawlands district, announced that it would accept bitcoin as a form of payment. At the time, manager Jonny McDonald told CoinDesk that, while many customers had heard about it, few actually knew how bitcoin worked.  This is a situation that may change: the CeX-hosted bitcoin ATM is Scotland’s first, and will surely act as a centre for bitcoin in the area, raising awareness and accessibility.  Within the UK, CeX's new Lamassu is a new entrant into a fast-growing ATM ecosystem occupied by familiar names like Robocoin.
