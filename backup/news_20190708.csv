The real story, however, was far more interesting.  According to an official company post, the police arrived to protect the office from ""people [who] were deceived by the so-called 'Wave Field Super Community,'"" a group that used the ""Chinese-language version of TRON’s name to defraud investors."" The victims called Tron itself a scam and cited the alleged suicide earlier this month of one investor in Wave Field Super Community.  ""The victims had been promised high rates of return on their investments in the name of TRON, BitTorrent and uTorrent,"" the company wrote.  The bilked investors also stormed the wrong place. According to Tron, they approached the office of Raybo Technologies, a Tron affiliate that seems to have filed a number of U.S. trademarks for various Tron-related phrases.  ""TRON officials expressed their sympathy and understanding for those who had been deceived, however, the company strongly condemns acts of violence that may be perpetrated as a result of events that are not in its direct control,"" the company wrote.  Tron CEO Justin Sun responded on Twitter:  The Wave Field Super Community has been running since January 2019 and banked on its name's similarity to Tron's use of the phrase ""Wave Field"" in China. The alleged Ponzi scheme promised massive returns and claimed to be investing in ""Tron, BitTorrent, and uTorrent.""  The group pretended to be a Tron ""Super Representative,"" essentially an important node on the network, a claim that Tron never confirmed. The site closed suddenly on July 1, leading to mass confusion. Users of the Chinese microblogging site Weibo circulated what appeared to be a suicide note by a woman named Xia Bing, who claimed to have borrowed money to invest in the scheme. The note first appeared on a site called Nuclear Finance in China.  Even with the ""raid"" rumors debunked, Tron's price has yet to fully recover.

42430710,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx9Xh,1562612726,Investor Fortress Will Buy Mt Gox Creditor Claims for $900 Per Bitcoin,"Creditors of Mt Gox waiting to get their bitcoin back from the long-defunct exchange can now get pennies on the dollar by selling their claims to Fortress Investment Group.  In a letter sent to creditors, Michael Hourigan, a managing director at the New York-based private equity firm, said he is purchasing these claims for a bitcoin investment vehicle the firm operates.  Mt Gox collapsed in 2014 after some 850,000 bitcoins disappeared from the exchange’s servers. While the exchange entered bankruptcy at the time, its status switched to civil rehabilitation last year.  Creditors of the exchange hoped that they would receive their missing bitcoin after the switch, rather than the cash equivalent at the time of the exchange’s collapse. The case is currently sitting before the Tokyo District Court.  Selling claims  Multiple copies of the Fortress letter were shared with CoinDesk, with one version published in full below.  “Dear Creditor,” the letter begins. “I manage an investment vehicle which has been buying Mt. Gox creditor claims.”  It goes on to add:  “We review each claim individually but are now generally able to offer $900 per BTC claim, or roughly 200% of the bankruptcy value (which was $451 per BTC claim). We can pay that in Bitcoin, or any fiat currency of your choice. Our payment would be made within 10 business days of the claim transfer confirmation.”  The $900 price is fair to both creditors and Fortress’ investors, Hourigan contends. (It represents about 7.5 percent of bitcoin's Monday afternoon market price of $11,870.72, according to CoinDesk's bitcoin price index.)  One creditor, who did not wish their identity to be made public, told CoinDesk that the letter also included their individual claim amount and a letter number.  Former Mt Gox creditor advocate Andy Pag announced in April that he had sold his stake to a New York-based investment firm for $600 per bitcoin. He did not name the firm at the time and did not respond to a request for comment by press time Monday.  Long-term interest  Fortress  has long been active in the crypto space and was reportedly looking to launch a bitcoin investment fund as far back as 2013 – before Mt Gox collapsed.  The New York-based firm bought $20 million in bitcoin that year, according to public filings.  Former Fortress CIO Michael Novogratz has continued to remain active in the space as well, most famously with his “crypto merchant bank,” Galaxy Digital.  Fortress was acquired by Japan-based SoftBank in late 2017, which itself has been active in the blockchain space (though less active with bitcoin projects specifically). However, Fortress remains in control of its day-to-day operations, according to the Financial Times.  Neither Hourigan nor a Fortress spokesperson immediately returned requests for comment.

In a joint statement Monday, the SEC Division of Trading and Markets and FINRA's office of general counsel outlined the different factors that the agencies consider when determining whether to approve a broker-dealer application by a company which touches digital assets, including custody and whether the assets are treated as securities under the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) of 1970.  “The ability of a broker-dealer to comply with aspects of the Customer Protection Rule is greatly facilitated by established laws and practices regarding the loss or theft of a security, that may not be available or effective in the case of certain digital assets,” the statement says.  Broker-dealers in the U.S. are legally registered and regulated entities which are able to purchase or sell securities, both on their own behalf, as well as for clients. Some companies want to use digital assets as securities, allowing them to market to institutional investors who cannot hold or directly purchase these assets.  While a broker can prove that it possesses the private keys to a crypto wallet, it would be difficult to prove that no other entity does, the statement says, explaining:  “It may not be able to demonstrate that no other party has a copy of the private key and could transfer the digital asset security without the broker-dealer’s consent.”  The joint statement comes in response to questions from market participants, the document says.  Companies applying for broker-dealer approvals have been sitting in limbo for months, with some firms waiting more than a year, as CoinDesk previously reported.  Many of these firms claimed that the SEC imposed a moratorium on broker-dealer approvals for firms which touch digital assets, while others said that cryptocurrency-based securities simply present novel issues that the regulatory agencies must first assess. Monday’s joint statement would appear to be a confirmation of the latter theory.  Crypto exchange Gemini was the most recent firm to apply for a broker-dealer approval.  Investor protection  Private key issues aside, the SEC and FINRA also discussed how digital assets might not fulfill SIPA requirement for digital securities.  SEC Rule 15c3-3 ""requires a broker-dealer to physically hold customers' fully paid and excess margin securities or maintain them free of lien at a good control location,"" the document reads. Typically, securities stored in accordance with SIPA requirements have safeguards to reverse or cancel mistaken and unauthorized transactions, and have third-party custodians holding the actual securities.  However, when it comes to digital assets, using third-party custodians may increase the risk that the securities are stolen or lost. The broker in question would not be able to reverse the transaction if the securities go to an unauthorized address, the statement says, adding:  “In the case of a digital asset security that does not meet the definition of 'security' under SIPA, and in the event of the failure of a carrying broker-dealer, SIPA protection likely would not apply and holders of those digital asset securities would have only unsecured general creditor claims against the broker-dealer’s estate.”  Other concerns revolve around record-keeping and reporting rules.  Specifically, ""the nature of distributed ledger technology, as well as the characteristics associated with digital asset securities, may make it difficult for a broker-dealer to evidence the existence of digital asset securities for the purposes of the broker-dealer’s regulatory books, records, and financial statements, including supporting schedules,"" the statement says.  Some digital asset companies are planning to use distributed ledgers with specific features designed to address record-keeping requirements to store their records, though these firms must still ""consider how the nature of the technology may impact their ability to comply"" with the reporting rules.

42430695,sd6iOBkuiC3F0LYOyMx93h,1562607009,Crypto Ponzi Scheme Says It Has 'No Cash to Pay out' to Upset Investors,"Bitcoin Wallet, a lucrative South African “investment scheme,” used to attract hundreds of investors a day, many of whom clamored at the company's doors to invest. Now, the company's shuttered office is attracting hundreds of protestors demanding their cash back, according to Ladysmith Gazette.  As of July 4, the enterprise that many regulators and media had begun suspecting of operating as a Ponzi scheme shut down. The firm enticed investors with promises of 100-percent returns in just over two weeks by reinvesting customer deposits in cryptocurrencies. These same investors want to know where their money went now that the company closed.  Bitcoin Wallet founder Sphelele “Sgumza” Mbatha admitted to the Ladysmith Gazette on Saturday that he doesn’t have any more cash to pay out to clients.  “I don’t know what’s going on. I don’t know online or how this system works. [It has] to be workshopped,” he said.  Before closing, Bitcoin Wallets had grown so popular that Mbatha stopped taking in deposits of less than 5,000 rand or $350. At the time, African News Agency speculated the firm received more than R2 million in cash deposits per day, representing “the largest daily cash flow in the whole of Ladysmith.”  A former paramedic, Mbatha claimed in a June radio interview that his operation was aboveboard though efforts by the ANA to confirm the legitimacy of the business registration proved futile.  The news agency spoke with market regulator Financial Services Conduct Authority (FSCA) which reportedly stated that the registrar’s signature in Bitcoin Wallet’s business certificate looked like it had been forged and needed to be investigated.  Despite these reported concerns of potential fraud, hundreds of South Africans had invested in the cryptocurrency upstart. Mbatha certainly made it easy.  According to ANA, investors would queue up overnight outside the Bitcoin Wallet office, provide basic identification information, sign a single page form, deposit however much they could, and then wait 15 working days to receive 100-percent returns.  The company charged a 10-percent administrative fee.  When asked about his business operations Mbatha stated funds entrusted to Bitcoin Wallets were reinvested in cryptocurrencies and then resold to the market at a higher price. Later, Mbatha declined a follow up interview stating, “time is money.”  Now, Mbatha claims he was only the “manager of the Ladysmith branch,” and that “I won’t continue working. I don’t have cash anymore. The owner says people must go online and collect their money online. I, myself, have invested my money in there. I submitted my banking details online and now I am also waiting.”  ANA previously reported Mbatha had become a local celebrity, drove luxury cars, and even had a police escort.

The two day course, titled ""Investigation of Cases Involving Crypto Currencies,"" will cover a wide range of educational components, including an introduction to blockchain technology, a discussion of standing legal traditions, and interpretations of major crypto crimes.  The program is not mandatory, but officers will be nominated to attend the conference. Other participants will be drawn from a compiled list of officers who had expressed an interest in “cybercrime and IT.”  India has become a center for crypto controversy amid planned government bans. The Reserve Bank of India decreed a de facto prohibition on banking relationships for crypto companies. This regulatory effort is currently facing arbitration in the Supreme Court.  Other government entities like The Department of Economic Affairs, Central Board of Direct Taxes, and the Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority signed on to a draft bill titled “Banning of Cryptocurrencies and Regulation of Official Digital Currencies Bill 2019,” for perceived issues of tax evasion, money laundering, and fraud inherent to cryptocurrencies.  Indeed, crypto crime has been an issue in the country. In June, Indian police arrested former BitConnect fraudster in connection to a fraudulent enterprise called Liberty Coin that promised investors 5,000-percent returns and did not deliver. Some victims that stepped forward claimed losses of tens of thousands of dollars.  The educational course will be available for police officers who report to the Inspector General of Police. Directors for the Central Bureau of Investigation, the Intelligence Bureau, the Narcotics Bureau, as well as many other chief executive figures received a copy of the training initiative document.

Speaking at an event at Peking University’s Institute of Digital Finance earlier on Monday, Wang Xin, head of the research bureau at the PBoC, said if Libra becomes widely used for international payments and effectively acts like money, ""would it ... accordingly have a large influence on monetary policy, financial stability and the international monetary system?""  As reported by the South China Morning Post, this risk means that the PBoC is looking at the situation with “high attention,” and could ramp up development of its own digital currency, which has been ongoing for some years.  “We had an early start … but lots of work is needed to consolidate our lead,” Wang said.  Facebook's Libra project was revealed in mid-June to be planned as a stablecoin linked to a basket of fiat currencies and government bonds.  Wang indicated China needed to know precisely which currencies those would be, and whether the U.S. dollar would play a role, according to the Post.  If Libra is ""closely associated"" with the dollar, it could mean that national fiat currencies would work alongside ""US dollar-centric digital currencies,"" according to Wang.  He warned that China wouldn't take that lying down, saying:  ""But there would be in essence one boss, that is the U.S. dollar and the United States. If so, it would bring a series of economic, financial and even international political consequences.”  Wang confimed that the PBoC had been working with market institutions on developing its central bank digital currency, according to the report.

42382318,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8VV,1562590833,ShapeShift's New Platform Aims to Make Crypto Self-Custody as Easy as Coinbase,"ShapeShift’s new one-stop shop for non-custodial crypto management is launching out of private beta today.  The new platform wants to rival custodians like Coinbase for ease-of-use, all while giving users full control of their private keys.  “Largely this came from my dissatisfaction with the reality that most of the large companies are custodial,” ShapeShift founder and CEO Erik Voorhees told CoinDesk in an interview. “It offers many services that a company like Coinbase would provide but on ShapeShift it’s done in a much more secure and self-sovereign way.”  The new platform allows users to buy, sell, trade and track multiple cryptocurrencies in a single place, with over 50 digital assets currently supported. Using the new platform requires a connected hardware wallet, like Trezor or KeepKey, which ShapeShift acquired in 2017. The company’s approach seeks to eliminate counterparty risk.  “There needed to be a platform that had great UX that my grandparents could use with limited instruction but that was built on a foundation of being non-custodial,” Voorhees said.  It’s a major launch for the five-year-old company, which was founded in 2014 as a way to swap one cryptocurrency for another.  The new ShapeShift has been over a year in the making and is aimed squarely at the retail market. And while the added functionality is meant to expand the company’s ambitions, Voorhees says the new platform is in keeping with ShapeShift’s libertarian roots.  “There’s a general sense within the industry is that if all that happens from the crypto revolution is that you just have a new set of custodians, then nothing really changed,” Voorhees said. By making it easy to hold your own keys, ShapeShift seeks to change that.  Voorhees said 20,000 users participated in the platform’s closed beta.  “A lot of people see it as the better way to use a hardware wallet,” he said of early user feedback.  Voorhees says more assets and features – like lending markets, derivatives and more fiat options – will be rolled into the platform going forward. ShapeShift also plans to release a mobile app. Notably, a know-your-customer (KYC) check is only required for trading.  “Large funds and institutions will likely still custody with third-party qualified custodians but as crypto becomes more mainstream, consumers will continue to custody using hardware solutions for some time,” Paul Veradittakit, a partner at Pantera Capital, which participated in ShapeShift’s $10.4 million Series A in 2017, told CoinDesk. “ShapeShift is providing a much better experience and product than the existing players.”  The launch comes seven months after significant downsizing at the company, which is operated primarily from the U.S. state of Colorado. However, as the most recent crypto winter recedes into the rearview, ShapeShift is optimistic about its ""next phase.""  Describing the platform in a press statement, Voorhees said:  “It is where crypto lives and breathes, and upon it we will build our vision for self-sovereign finance.”  Erik Voorhees image via ShapeShift",POSITIVE,없음,EXCHANGE | FIAT | MARKET | WALLET,Zack Seward,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/08/shapeshifts-new-platform-aims-to-make-crypto-self-custody-as-easy-as-coinbase,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/c72e4c20d73111a5e91b30c81efa75c3d3686fbb-1500x844.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

42382294,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8Cd,1562587242,KuCoin Launches Bitcoin Derivatives Trading With 20x Leverage,"IDG-backed cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin has just launched a platform offering crypto derivatives trading.  Announced Monday, the KuMEX trading venue is now live in public beta and will offer initially a bitcoin perpetual contract (XBTUSDM), quoted in U.S. dollars, with up to 20x leverage.  Aimed to make pricing ""more fair and rigorous,"" KuCoin said, KuMEX uses a bitcoin spot index providing a volume-weighted average of the U.S. dollar price of bitcoin across six exchanges: Coinbase Pro, Bitstamp, Kraken, Gemini, Liquid and Bittrex.  The spot index also avoids a contract being liquidated ""because of the low liquidity of the trading platform or the large price fluctuations of one or two spot exchanges,"" the exchange explained.  KuMEX offers some protection from risk with an insurance fund it says is ""fully transparent,"" with the balance to be disclosed on the platform each day.  ""This fund ensures that investors who are forced to close their positions will not lose money that exceeds their position margin,"" according to the announcement.  Should the insurance fund turn out to be insufficient to cover losses, KuMEX also has an ""auto-deleveraging"" system, said to be less ""inflexible"" than settlement via more standard socialised loss mechanisms.  To encourage new retail investors to get involved with crypto derivatives, KuMEX is offering a lower investment threshold than found at some other providers.  ""The XBTUSDM contract value is 1 USD, which enables traders to make a more flexible investment. At the same time, KuMEX offers a negative fee for Makers at a rate of -0.025% with a certain amount of fixed commission, encouraging users to provide liquidity to the platform through making the market and earning some commission as an incentive,"" says KuCoin.  KuCoin CEO Michael Gan said:  “Compared to the spot market, derivatives are much riskier due to the leverage used, so we are more cautious in providing such services. KuMEX is a derivative trading platform independently developed by our team, and from its inception, we have positioned it as a genuine and advanced financial product, so that all users can trust the platform and trade on it freely, without worrying about the loss caused by any form of manipulation. ”  After the full launch of the platform, 50 percent of net KuMEX revenue will be assigned for distribution to holders of the exchange's token, KuCoin, the release states.

42382319,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8ZH,1562583636,Bitcoin Price Nears $12K After Rising $500 in Minutes,"View  BTC could rise to key resistance at $12,061 in the next few hours, as the hourly chart is reporting a symmetrical triangle breakout.  A high-volume break above $12,061 would invalidate the bearish lower-highs pattern and open the doors to the recent high of $13,880.  However, a break with low volumes could turn out to be a bull trap, especially as the weekly chart indicators continue to report overbought conditions.  On the downside, a move below $10,769 (July 5 low) would expose last week's low of $9,615.      Bitcoin leaped into the green in the European trading hours, and is now looking to scale key resistance above $12,000.  The top cryptocurrency by market value jumped from $11,400 to $11,916 in the 15 minutes to 09:10 UTC, according to Bitstamp data.  With the $500 spike, BTC has put an end to directionless trading seen over the weekend, in which the cryptocurrency was restricted to a narrowing price range above $11,000.  Interestingly, the range breakout occurred three days after bitcoin’s hash rate – a measure of total miners' performance – rose to 74.5 million tera hashes per second, representing a more than 100% rise year-on-year, according to bitinfocharts.com.  Some observers including former Wall Street trader and journalist Max Keiser consider a rise in hash rate an advance indicator of impending price rise. If true, BTC could scale the resistance of the bearish lower high at $12,061 and soon revisit recent highs.  Conversely, though, many others, including renowned analyst Alex Kruger, are of the opinion that hash rate follows price, and the former outperforming the latter is a sign of ""overly exuberant"" miners. As a result, expecting a bullish move to recent highs on the basis of hash rate alone could prove costly.  That said, the short duration technical charts do indicate scope for a break above $12,061.  As of writing, BTC is changing hands at $11,830, representing a 2 percent gain on the day.  Hourly chart  BTC’s previous hourly candle closed at $11,790, confirming an upside break of the symmetrical triangle pattern created over the last four days.  The triangle breakout, a bullish continuation pattern, is backed by a rise in buy volumes (green bar) and indicates a resumption of the recovery from the July 2 low of $9,614.  Prices, therefore, could invalidate the bearish lower-highs pattern with a move above $12,061 (July 4 high).  Daily and weekly charts  Bitcoin fell 6.86 percent on July 4, taking the shine off the hammer reversal candlestick pattern created over the preceding two days.  A potential break above $12,061, as suggested by the hourly chart, would validate the bullish hammer reversal and open the doors to a retest of the recent high of $13,880.  Any move above $12,061 will likely be short-lived if trading volumes remain low.  It is worth noting that the weekly relative strength index (RSI) continues to report overbought conditions. So, the probability of a low-volume breakout trapping the bulls on the wrong side of the market is high.

42382303,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8KB,1562580924,Korean Watchdog Warns of Financial Stability Risk From Facebook's Libra,"Facebook's recently unveiled Libra cryptocurrency project threatens the stability of financial systems, according to a South Korean financial regulator.  In a new Korean-language trends update published July 5 and reported by CoinDesk Korea, the nation's Financial Services Commission (FSC) looks at what might occur ""If 2.4 billion Facebook users worldwide transfer one tenth of their bank deposits to Libra.""  Should that scenario come about, banks' solvency would diminish, as would their loan reserves, representing a threat to emerging markets from the relocation of the capital out of those countries.  The FSC also raised concerns that bank runs could occur during financial or foreign exchange crises, as people move their national fiat currency to Libra. The simplification of money exchange and remittances through Libra is also expected to limit central banks' ability to control international capital movements. The effectiveness of monetary policy would also be limited if Libra becomes widely exchanged for central bank currency.  The agency further expressed concern that Libra could be widely used for money laundering without proper bank-like controls. It added that ""a large financial institution, such as Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan,"" had refused to participate in Libra.  The project is a major threat to the traditional banking industry, the report says. If a company such as Facebook buys a bond instead of making a bank deposit with customer funds, the financial condition of the bank may be worsened. And if Libra allows virtually free overseas payments, South Korean banks' trillions of won in revenues from remittances would be significantly reduced.  The likelihood of successful commercialization of Libra is higher than for other cryptocurrencies, the FSC goes on. Offering financial services through its social media services such as Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, with their billions of users, the firm can more easily guarantee convenience and price competitiveness.  The FSC stressed that the report is to ""facilitate the understanding of the press and other media"" on overseas trends and not its official opinion on Libra.

42382304,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8LR,1562576415,Ex-R3 Exec's New Mission: Run $100 Trillion Fund Trade on Private Blockchains,"Brian McNulty, a former R3 managing director who left the company in January, has emerged from the bushes with a blockchain project to streamline the fund management industry.  Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, FundAdminChain (FAC), which is helmed by McNulty, also boasts R3 CEO David Rutter as an advisor, as well as buy-side veterans Pete Townsend and Mark Harrison, both formerly of BNP Paribas.  Built on R3's Corda platform, FAC aims to bring the distributors, transfer agents, custodians and other intermediaries involved in the buying and selling of units in a fund onto a distributed ledger. The blockchain is targeting transfer agencies and messaging, to begin with, and then aims to build out into asset services.  The size of this industry is about $100 trillion globally, according to FAC's pitch deck; the London-based firm is starting with the comparatively modest goal of capturing 1.5 percent of the U.K. market's $8.5 trillion in assets under management (AUM) in Year One.  A distributed ledger aimed at the funds space had been on McNulty's mind for some time, he said, and he honed the idea during his time as global head of services at R3. As such, he’s in no doubt about the choice of platform.  McNulty told CoinDesk:  “R3 is keen to fuel companies like us and we couldn't do this without them. You could say I’ve drunk the Kool-Aid, but to be honest I'd only do this on Corda. It's the only one that's fit for purpose. And having been in there for three years, I can see how we can work with some of the other builders of solutions.”  Millions in savings  The potential savings from the technology are “exciting,"" according to McNulty. FAC will charge fund managers 0.5 basis points for the registry, depository and transaction functions, compared to 5 basis points on average incumbents charge for the same services, he said.  Using FAC can save fund managers a minimum £30 million per year, per each jurisdiction where a fund is domiciled, for every £100 billion assets under management, McNulty claimed.  The minimum viable product is out the gates, McNulty said with 25 fund managers looking at it. He said FAC is expecting to do a raise at the tail end of this year and live production is slated for June 2020.  McNulty joined R3 in March 2016 having previously founded the PTDL (Post Trade Distributed Ledger) Group, a blockchain consortium which numbered around 40 members including CME Group, State Street and the London Stock Exchange.  FAC will be built using the full commercial version of Corda as opposed to being an open-source “CorDapp."" As such, the Corda licensing will be wrapped in the license for FAC, said McNulty, adding:  “Most things that are going to go into production in banks probably need the enterprise [Corda]. So I am building on an enterprise version from the outset because I know that's where we'll end up.”  Logo pic courtesy of R3",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | MARKET | TECHNOLOGY | WALLET,Ian Allison,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/08/ex-r3-execs-new-mission-run-100-trillion-fund-trade-on-private-blockchains,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/1ba1b49a742a99375ede4092118f5f780235e580-1500x978.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

According to a report from Bloomberg, ECB Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said in France on Sunday:  “It’s out of the question to allow them to develop in a regulatory void for their financial service activities, because it’s just too dangerous. We have to move more quickly than we’ve been able to do up until now.”  Such projects are a ""useful wake-up call for regulators and public authorities,"" said Coeure, since they pose a number of questions and may get regulators to improve the way they work.  The news comes as the latest in a string of reports indicating that global watchdogs are worried that the Libra project, in combination with Facebook's billions of users, could pose a threat to national fiat currencies such as the dollar. There are additional concerns about Libra's possible use in money laundering if not governed correctly  Some U.S. lawmakers are even seeking a freeze on development of the cryptocurrency, and different government agencies will hold hearings this month to discuss the project.  Elsewhere, watchdogs in nations such as France, Japan, Singapore have expressed some concern over Libra and said more needs to be known about the project.  French finance minister Bruno Le Maire has previously said that “it is out of question’’ that Libra be allowed “become a sovereign currency. It can’t and it must not happen.”  On Sunday, Coeure argued that cryptocurrency development brings to light weaknesses in current regulations, as well as a failure of the banking system to adopt new technology, Bloomberg wrote.

42382311,0r6Zag11PPDEMKgUX9r8QT,1562565620,High-Frequency Trading Is Newest Battleground in Crypto Exchange Race,"The Takeaway  High-frequency trading (HFT), a longtime and controversial practice in traditional markets, is becoming commonplace in crypto, too.  Placing trading servers physically close to exchanges' matching engines can win an edge on speed. This helps HFT firms make large profits in the legacy markets.  Crypto exchanges such as ErisX, Huobi and Gemini are trying to attract large algorithmic traders with colocation offers.  Demand for the service is high, but its benefits are a matter of debate, due to the structure of the crypto market.      A handful of cryptocurrency exchanges are rolling out the red carpet for high-frequency traders.  Huobi, based in Singapore, and ErisX, in Chicago, have separately begun offering colocation, in which a client's server is placed in the same facility or cloud as the exchange's, officials at each exchange told CoinDesk. This allows those investors to execute trades up to a hundred times faster, giving them an edge over the rest of the market.  These exchanges join Gemini, which was one of the first crypto firms to offer colocation at a popular data center in the New York area, and is about to expand the option to include a second site in Chicago.  Notably, none of these exchanges charges for the service, seeing it as a way to differentiate themselves. ""It's our competitive advantage,"" said Andrey Grachev, head of Huobi Russia, the exchange's Moscow client office.  To be sure, such accommodations remain rare in crypto, which historically was dominated by individual traders and only recently began to draw interest from institutional investors such as hedge funds and family offices.  But the exchanges' moves are a sign that high-frequency trading (HFT), a longtime and controversial practice in traditional financial markets, is slowly entering the crypto sphere. And though ""bots"" have been present in crypto since the days of Mt. Gox, colocation takes algorithmic trading to a different level.  Eric Wall, former crypto and blockchain lead at Cinnober, a financial technology company acquired by Nasdaq, told CoinDesk:  ""It's big business, everyone I've been speaking to that runs an exchange mentioned being approached by Wall Street types with these kinds of requests.""  Most crypto exchanges are not ready to satisfy this demand, Wall said. These are ""very new concepts to many retail-focused exchanges with no experience of the traditional world, it seems.""  800K trades a day  In the six months since Huobi opened its Russia office, around 50 clients have taken advantage of its colocation service by locating their servers in the same cloud and using the same domain name service (DNS) as the exchange, according to Grachev.  The option allows these clients to make trades 70 to 100 times faster than other users, he said. ""One of our clients makes about 800,000 trades a day, and there are more and more such clients.""  Unlike many crypto exchanges that use cloud-based servers, ErisX has a hardware matching engine, located in the Equinix data center in Secaucus, New Jersey, said Matthew Trudeau, the exchange's chief strategy officer.  The same facility houses the matching engines of a range of major traditional exchanges, brokers and trading firms, Trudeau told CoinDesk, so traders that colocated servers in the data center can connect to ErisX's matching engine there. (The firm launched spot trading in several cryptocurrencies in April and recently obtained regulatory approval for futures.)  Gemini, founded in 2014 by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, also houses its primary trading platform at Equinix and offers colocation there. The exchange plans to offer another colocation option soon in Equinix's Chicago data center, where multiple stock exchanges — and their HFT customers — keep their hardware, according to Gemini's website.  In a statement, Gemini's managing director of operations Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto said the exchange ""offers a variety of connectivity options to suit our customers’ needs. Each option is available to all of our customers free of charge.""  Coinbase, the leading U.S. crypto exchange, almost entered the fray, but this year closed down its Chicago division that had been working on services for high-frequency traders, including colocation. At the time, the exchange cited its prioritization of other institutional services.  The company declined to comment for this article. (Gemini, which just opened a Chicago office, hired some of Coinbase's former employees there.)  Controversial practice  All of this invites the question of whether HFT, given its history on Wall Street, could exacerbate problems in the opaque and volatile crypto markets.  As depicted in Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys, algorithmic stock traders placed their servers in the physical vicinity of exchanges' to execute trades faster than other investors and make profits on arbitrage between markets in fractions of a second.  The issue with HFT, as explained by Lewis, is that in a market where some players can perform trades hundreds of times faster than ordinary users, they get an unfair advantage and leave ordinary, non-algorithmic traders with inferior price options.  Another problem with HFT, according to a 2011 report by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), is that it can dramatically increase volatility in markets.  In particular, it contributed to the so-called Flash Crash on May 6, 2010, when the prices of many U.S. securities fell and recovered dramatically in minutes, exposing ordinary traders to a higher risk which they couldn't manage as quickly as HFTs.  High-speed trading has led to other technical glitches that cost companies hundreds of millions of dollars, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago wrote in 2012, noting that ""some high-speed trading firms have equity ownership stakes in certain exchanges.""  Maturing market  However, ErisX's Trudeau (who, it should be noted, was one of the early employees of stock exchange IEX, the heroes of Flash Boys) argued that high-frequency arbitrage and automated trading, in general, can benefit markets.  They are helping to narrow the price spread between different exchanges over time and make markets more efficient – including the crypto market, Trudeau said, explaining:  ""This phenomenon has occurred in other asset classes as trading has become more electronic and more automated. Market makers and arbitrageurs are able to trade more efficiently, which improves price formation, price discovery and liquidity. Arbitrage opportunities may become fewer and more fleeting, which is a sign of a more efficient and maturing market.""  It's important, however, to check if the exchanges and high-frequency traders strike deals with preferential terms which are not disclosed to the market, he noted.  As for ErisX, it ""offers transparent, standardized pricing and connectivity options for our customers. All customs are offered the same terms of access and fees,"" Trudeau said.  For its part, Huobi tries to make sure all users ""compete on a level playing field,"" said the exchange's head of global sales and institutional business, Lester Li.  Li told CoinDesk:  ""Our users know that we monitor for any abusive trading activity. We also continually remind users that there will always be risks when you trade, that is why we strongly recommend users to trade within their means and be mindful of the risks involved.""  Protecting retail  Still, other exchanges contacted by CoinDesk made a point of saying they don't do anything special for algo traders.  A smaller exchange tailored for institutional clients, LGO Markets, which launched earlier this year, took the opposite approach, deliberately slowing the trading process for everyone, according to CEO Hugo Renaudin.  Before getting matched, the orders are gathered into batches and the hash of every batch gets recorded in the bitcoin blockchain — each batch takes around 500 milliseconds to form, so this serves as a ""speed bump"" for trades, Renaudin said. As a result, ""every trader has the same feedback on the activity of the platform.""  Taking a similar stance, Kraken's vice president of engineering, Steve Hunt, told CoinDesk the exchange doesn't do anything differently for HFT customers.  ""We want all customers regardless of size or scale to have equal access to our marketplace,"" Hunt said.  Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange, is not considering offering colocation, account manager Anatoly Kondyakov told attendees of a recent ""elite investor"" meetup in Moscow. He gave two reasons.  First, ""we're trying to protect retail customers,"" Kondyakov said, answering a question from the audience. Second, colocation means an official presence in a particular jurisdiction, he said, which Binance is not willing to do at the moment. (Binance is known for its deft regulatory arbitrage.)  Too soon?  Still, others said the crypto market hasn't caught up with the traditional financial world to the point where offering colocation services to HFT firms would make much sense.  ""Currently, the crypto market structure is still developing. HFT, in the context of equity and FX markets, does not really exist,"" said Wilfred Daye, head of financial markets at San Francisco-based exchange OKCoin.  Traders coming into crypto from the traditional markets do ask for colocation, he said, but ""the ask is one-off, not a popular ask in crypto,"" so OKCoin doesn't offer this service.  David Weisberger, сo-founder and CEO of market data platform Coinroutes, has another reason to be skeptical about HFT in crypto: this market is so much more dispersed and volatile that what works with stocks just won't with bitcoin.  The concept of HFT front-running is irrelevant in crypto, Weisberger said, where the prices vary between different exchanges much more than in traditional markets:  ""In futures or equities, with relatively large minimum quote variations, the bid offer spread is often stable with a lot of bids and offers at the same price. In that circumstance the fastest gets to be at the front of the queue whenever the price changes. Those orders at the front of the queue are profitable, while the ones at the back are not. In crypto, the tick size (price variation) is so small, it is easy to be 'first' by paying a slightly higher amount, so no need for incredible speed.""  Plus, crypto exchanges are so scattered around the world that there is no point in ""being colocated to one exchange and still having to wait seconds for Binance to update,"" Weisberger added.  The reason there is demand for colocation at crypto exchanges, he concluded, is simply human nature:  ""People always fight the last war. People do what they are used to.""

The draft guide also sets out detailed parameters on how digital payment tokens are defined, which should have all of the listed characteristics below:    a) It is expressed as a unit      b) It is fungible    c) It is not denominated in any currency, and is not pegged by its issuer to any currency    d) It can be transferred, stored or traded electronically    e) It is, or is intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public, or a section of the public, without any substantial restrictions on its use as consideration.    ""Examples of digital payment tokens are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Monero, Ripple and Zcash,"" the IRAS added in the proposal.  Notably, the agency specified that stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a value pegged to a fiat currency, may not qualify to be GST exempt.  ""Any digital token that is denominated in any fiat currency or with a value pegged to any fiat currency will not qualify as a digital payment token,"" the IRAS said in the draft. ""For example, a digital token pegged to US dollars will not qualify as a digital payment token.""  IRAS said the effort to end GST liabilities on cryptocurrencies follows worldwide development and growth in the space that has led various jurisdictions to have reviewed their stance. ""Similarly, IRAS has reviewed its GST position to keep up to date with these developments,"" the agency said.  Under the current framework, the supply of digital payment tokens is still seen as a taxable supply of services.  ""Therefore, the sale, issue or transfer of such tokens for consideration by a GST-registered business is subject to GST. When the tokens are used as payment for the purchase of goods or services, a barter trade resulting in two separate supplies arises — a taxable supply of the tokens and a supply of the goods or services,"" the IRAS said in the draft.  In October 2017, lawmakers in Australia passed a piece of legislation to end what was called double taxation, exempting the liability for paying goods and services tax (GST) on cryptocurrency purchases.
