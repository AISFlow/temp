11535522,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526070,1680908459,Little-Known Crypto Beats Top 100 Rivals With 23% Rally On Good Friday,"Injective Protocol‚Äôs native crypto, INJ, has been on an impressive winning streak over the past seven days, outshining every other cryptocurrency in the top 100. With an incredible surge of over 20% in just a week, INJ has caught the attention of the crypto world, with many wondering what could be fueling such an impressive rise. Injective Protocol is a decentralized exchange platform that allows for the trading of any asset across various blockchains, without any centralization or custody. With this innovative approach, Injective has managed to carve a niche for itself in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape. The question now on everyone‚Äôs mind is whether INJ‚Äôs impressive run will continue past Good Friday or come to an end. INJ Price Surges With New Integrations And Partnerships The crypto has been on an impressive upward trajectory, propelled by recent developments in the platform‚Äôs ecosystem. Coingecko‚Äôs latest data shows a current value of $5.76, reflecting a remarkable 7.3% surge in the past 24 hours and an impressive 22.7% increase over the past week. One of the key drivers of INJ‚Äôs recent surge is the introduction of Cascade, the first interchain Solama SVM rollup. This major development paves the way for Injective to unlock the vast $9 billion Solana developer ecosystem. Moreover, the platform‚Äôs integration of Pyth, a fast-growing oracle network, has further strengthened its infrastructure and fueled investor confidence. Another significant factor behind INJ‚Äôs recent price spike is the launch of liquid staking through a partnership with Stride. The move allows INJ holders to stake their tokens while still retaining liquidity, offering a more flexible and lucrative option for investors. To celebrate the launch of liquid staking for INJ, @stride_zone is airdropping 100,000 $STRD tokens to @Injective_ stakers! Be sure to stake your $INJ to qualify for future airdrops and rewards ü™Ç pic.twitter.com/HnOEaf4gve ‚Äî Injective ü•∑ (@Injective_) April 4, 2023 To commemorate the milestone, Stride has announced that it will airdrop 100,000 STRD tokens to Injective stakers, adding further value to the platform‚Äôs already impressive offerings. Crypto Bullish Trend Suggests More Gains Ahead TradingView charts for INJ indicates a strong bullish trend in recent months. The token has surpassed all moving averages, while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) continues to rise, signaling further potential upside.

On the daily chart, the crypto has broken through the key resistance level at $5, reaching its highest level since March 18. This impressive feat suggests that the token is likely to continue its upward trajectory in the coming days, as investors set their sights on the next resistance level at $7. However, it‚Äôs important to note that further gains at this stage may be limited, as the token has already experienced substantial growth. Still, INJ‚Äôs bullish trend and recent breakthroughs in its ecosystem suggest that the platform is gaining momentum and becoming an increasingly attractive option for crypto investors. -Featured image from Crypto Briefing",POSITIVE,INJ,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | ICO | TRADING | INJ,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/little-known-crypto-beats-top-rivals/,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png

11528735,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=526055,1680904854,Uniswap Who? Trader Joe‚Äôs AMM Takes DeFi By Storm,"In the fast-evolving world of decentralized finance (DeFi), new players are constantly emerging with innovative solutions to address the challenges of trading and liquidity provision. One platform that has been making waves in the DeFi ecosystem is Trader Joe, which has gained steam with its capital-efficient decentralized exchange (DEX). According to a recent Twitter post by Chase, a researcher at Messari, the heart of Trader Joe‚Äôs success is its Liquidity Book (LB), a concentrated liquidity model that is being hailed as a game-changer for liquidity providers in the DeFi space. Related Reading: DYDX Tumbles 5% As Ethereum-Based DEX Wind Down Operations What Makes Trader Joe Different From Other DeFi Protocols? Competing with established players like Uniswap V3, Trader Joe‚Äôs LB is quickly gaining traction, being the fastest-growing DEX over the last 180 days. The platform‚Äôs surging growth is a testament to its appeal to traders and liquidity providers. Trader Joe and Uniswap are decentralized exchanges allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies without relying on centralized intermediaries. However, there are several key differences between the two platforms: Liquidity Model: Trader Joe‚Äôs uses a concentrated liquidity model called the Liquidity Book, as said before, while Uniswap uses a constant product market maker model. The LB can be more capital-efficient and cost-effective for liquidity providers, while the construct product model is simpler and more widely used in the DeFi ecosystem. Furthermore, its LB is a liquidity provision model developed by Trader Joe‚Äôs. It allows liquidity providers to concentrate their funds in a specific price range rather than spreading them out across the entire price spectrum. Additionally, the LB can be more cost-effective for smaller liquidity providers, who may not have the capital to provide liquidity across the entire price spectrum on other Automatized Market Makers (AMMs) Fees: Trader Joe‚Äôs charges lower fees than Uniswap. This can make it more attractive to traders and liquidity providers looking to minimize costs. Development: Trader Joe‚Äôs is community-driven, allowing users to propose and vote on changes on the platform. On the other hand, Uniswap is governed by a protocol controlled by a small group of stakeholders. Keys Behind Trader Joe‚Äôs Current Success In DeFi According to Chase, one key factor behind this success is Joe V2‚Äôs higher base fees. This means liquidity providers earn more fees on every trade in the pool. Joe V2 adds a volatility fee, further increasing liquidity providers‚Äô profitability. According to data compiled by Chase, 36.5% of Joe V2‚Äôs WETH-USDC liquidity on Arbitrum falls within the +/- 2% price range, significantly higher than the 19.9% for Uniswap V3 and the 4% for SushiSwap. This concentration of liquidity is likely driven by the lower liquidity provider management costs on Joe V2 compared to Uniswap V3. Despite the success of Trader Joe‚Äôs V2 pools regarding liquidity provider profitability and liquidity concentration, the platform still faces significant competition from established players like UniSwap. Per the researcher, over the last 2 weeks, UniSwap V3 has averaged $10 million in daily ARB-ETH volumes from 1inch, while Joe V2 has only averaged $9,800. Chase claims that to compete with UniSwap and attract more trading volumes, Joe V2 must either cut its fees or grow its liquidity. As of this writing, the circulating market capitalization of Uniswap is worth over $4.5 billion, down 2% in the last few days. In contrast, Trader Joe‚Äôs market cap is currently at $195 million, with a trading volume of $29 billion. This is significantly lower than Uniswap‚Äôs trading volume, which is $831 billion. Despite the differences between Trader Joe and Uniswap, the fast growth of Trader Joe, and the continued dominance of Uniswap in the decentralized exchanges (DEX), the DeFi ecosystem seems poise to grow. Competition and further innovations in the ecosystem can attract more users and investors to the nascent industry and its technologies.

Bitcoin Bollinger Bands Signal An Impending Rollercoaster Ride,"After weeks of going nowhere, Bitcoin price is gearing up for a massive move. Buckle up, because we are going to show you why, according to the Bollinger Bands, BTC is about to blow. Crypto Market Goes Calm After A Q1 2023 Comeback Bitcoin has managed to survive a brutal crypto winter and even show resilience throughout bleak macro conditions and rising interest rates from the US Federal Reserve. Bitcoin‚Äôs price fell sharply throughout 2022, but since the start of 2023, it has made a strong recovery. Despite the recently positive outlook for Bitcoin price, it has been stuck in a tight range for several weeks now. The top cryptocurrency by market cap has been trading between $27,000 and $29,000 unable to break out of this range. Many traders and investors are eagerly anticipation more confirmation of new trend to emerge, but the market appears to need a catalyst before a significant breakout or breakdown. Related Reading: Data Says Bitcoin Has Begun Its Most Bullish Month Historically The lack of volatility and sideways movement has caused the Bollinger Bands on the daily timeframe to become the tightest they have been since January 2023. The Bands were even more narrow then, and resulted in a 40% rise. Tightening Bollinger Bands signal that volatility is incoming for Bitcoin, and traders and investors should be prepared for a rollercoaster ride. The bands are tight and ready to explode | BTCUSD on TradingView.com Bollinger Bands Suggest Powerful Volatility In Bitcoin Is Ahead The Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool that was created by John Bollinger in the early 1980s. The tool is used to measure the volatility of an asset by using moving averages and standard deviations. The bands consist of three lines: a middle line that represents the 20-period simple moving average, and two outer lines that are two standard deviations away from the SMA. When the Bollinger Bands are tight, it means that the asset‚Äôs price is trading in a narrow range, and volatility is likely to follow. On the other hand, when the bands are wide, it indicates that the asset‚Äôs price is experiencing significant volatility. A squeeze occurs when a period of narrowing gives way to sudden, violent expansion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Structure Points To New Uptrend, Here‚Äôs Why Given the current tightness of the Bollinger Bands for Bitcoin, the squeeze setup suggests a that a significant price move is imminent. The direction of this move is uncertain, however. Regardless, traders and investors should be prepared for volatility in the coming days or weeks. With a big move on the way, what can we expect if the direction is ultimately bearish or bullish? A bullish breakout should take BTCUSD well above $30,000 per coin, possibly extending to $40,000 in several weeks if the trend persists. A bearish breakout, meanwhile would have Bitcoin retesting $20,000 or possibly lower.

According to an official announcement, users in this country will be unable to open new accounts starting today, April 7th, at 17:00 UTC. Related Reading: Bullish Signal? MATIC Becomes Top 3 Most Purchased Coin Among Ethereum Whales As a result of the announcement and following today‚Äôs trend in the crypto market, dYdX‚Äôs native token experienced a spike in selling pressure. As of this writing, the token trades at $2.4, with a 5% loss in the last 24 hours and a 7% decline in the previous two weeks. Regulatory Climate Impacts Ethereum Protocol dYdX Per the announcement, Canadian users cannot trade on the platform, and starting April 14th, they can only close positions. From that moment forward, users can withdraw funds anytime, but can‚Äôt open new accounts or positions. The team behind dYdX stated: As part of the wind down process, we want to provide existing Canadian users ample time to manage and close their positions on dYdX. Therefore, existing users will be able to continue to execute trades on our platform for one week. According to the official post, the decision was driven by the regulatory climate in Canada. The team behind the DEX announced: As always, dYdX is committed to providing transparency around product decisions and democratizing access to financial opportunity. We hope that the regulatory climate in Canada will change over time to allow us to resume services in the country. In North America, regulators took hostile measures against the crypto market. In particular, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has relentlessly pursued actors in the nascent industry. The regulators believe assets in the industry, except for Bitcoin, are securities. Thus, decentralized exchanges (DEX), DeFi, and other projects could violate their securities laws. In 2023 alone, the SEC took action against crypto exchanges such as Kraken, Binance, and other crypto projects. The regulatory climate in North America could usher in a global crackdown on the nascent industry and its projects. As a result, dYdX and DeFi protocols could see a negative impact on their activities. Data from Token Terminal on this DEX‚Äôs operations still records positive performance.

However, times may be changing for the cryptocurrency as the token is beginning to garner the favor of the largest Ethereum whales. Ethereum Whales Buy MATIC Data from WhaleStats shows that MATIC has been on the radar of the top 100 Ethereum whales.

This buying spree from these ETH whales has also led to an increase in the amount of MATIC they currently hold. The digital asset is now the 7th largest holding of the top 100 Ethereum whales, with an average amount held of $1.5 million. The coin now makes up 2.98% of their total token holdings. This means that the whales now collectively hold over $150 million worth of MATIC.

Heading Into Bullish Territory Naturally, when large whales start accumulating a token, it usually points to bullish trends to come as they reduce the circulating supply of the cryptocurrency in the open market. Hence, it can see the price of the digital asset go up quickly and MATIC is no exception. MATIC price trending above $1.1 | Source: MATICUSD on TradingView.com With these whales buying up large numbers of the token, it can easily push the price up. Add in the fact that MATIC is currently trading above its 100-day and 200-day moving averages despite the recent decline and it shows a tendency for more upward momentum rather than downward.

Oracles play a crucial role in providing external data to smart contracts, allowing them to execute complex functions and make decisions based on real-world data. Furthermore, Charlie3‚Äôs Oracle price feeds are designed to be highly secure and resist attacks. They use a decentralized network of nodes to aggregate price data from multiple sources and provide a single reliable price feed, making it more difficult for any node or source to manipulate price data. In addition, Charlie3‚Äôs Oracle price feeds are highly customizable, allowing protocols like Liqwid to select the specific price data source it wants to use. On the other hand, these Oracle feeds are designed to be scalable, essential for supporting the growing demand for DeFi protocols on Cardano. Integrating Charlie3‚Äôs decentralized price feeds a significant milestone for the protocol. It ensures that the price data referenced within its market is accurate, continuous, and resistant to centralized oracle price manipulations. This will further help Liqwid create new loans, update collateral values, and initiate liquidations for undercollateralized loans. By integrating Cardano native oracle service provider Charli3‚Äôs price feeds, Liqwid is moving towards a fully decentralized lending protocol on Cardano. Now, as the first protocol to integrate with a Cardano native decentralized oracle protocol, Liqwid has stated that it aims to set a focus on decentralization and safety for other protocols within the Cardano DeFi ecosystem to follow. Is ADA Poised To Rally With This New Integration? According to Yevhen, the strong demand from whales played a significant role in the first quarter rally of ADA. As the demand from whales increased in Q1, the price of ADA also increased to its yearly high of $0,420, which according to Yevhen, attracted more investors to Cardano‚Äôs native token. Per Yevhen‚Äôs analysis, ADA has seen a shift in recent weeks, with whales beginning to ‚Äúscoop up‚Äù the coin. Furthermore, over the past four weeks, addresses holding 1-10 million ADA have reportedly added over 150 million ADA coins to their holdings, worth $60 million at the current market value, showing a bullish bias among the whales, as they are accumulating more ADA. This trend is also reflected in ADA‚Äôs supply distribution, which shows that addresses holding between 1000-10 million ADA have been accumulating the token. Overall, the shift towards whale accumulation of ADA is a positive sign for the Cardano ecosystem. Furthermore, the growth of the Cardano DeFi ecosystem is likely to attract more investors and users to its network, which could further lead to a boost in the price of ADA in the mid-term. ADA is trading at $0.383, with a slight decline of 0.1% in the last 24 hours.

42412395,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4naw,1680883500,"OpenSea Goes Pro, Ralph Lauren Takes Crypto","This week, non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea took aim at top competitor Blur by launching a new platform targeting pro NFT traders. Reception to OpenSea Pro has been generally positive so far, though it‚Äôs unclear yet if the move will be enough to entice Blur loyalists to make the switch.  Meanwhile, American fashion retailer Ralph Lauren will soon be accepting cryptocurrency payments at its newly opened Miami store, and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) VitaDAO has voted in favor of launching a for-profit company to speed up funding for research into longevity science.  You‚Äôre reading The Airdrop, our weekly newsletter where we discuss the biggest stories across Web3. Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Friday.  This Week's Alpha  OpenSea Pro takes sail: NFT marketplace OpenSea, which dominated the market until competitor Blur entered the scene, has launched its OpenSea Pro platform to court professional NFT traders and reclaim its throne. OpenSea has long appealed to collectors and artists for its simplicity and ubiquity, though Blur has managed to edge ahead when it comes to fast-paced traders due to its fee-free structure and trading incentive mechanisms. The two entities have been locked in a tense head-to-head battle in recent months, copying each other‚Äôs moves and shifting policies to stay competitive.  OpenSea Pro package: OpenSea Pro is a rebrand of Gem, the NFT market aggregator it acquired in April. The new platform is said to pull information from 170 marketplaces and offers traders real-time data tracking, inventory management, optimized gas fees and more. The site also offered early Gem adopters the opportunity to collect an NFT called Gemesis as a reward for their participation.  Blurred lines: It‚Äôs unclear if OpenSea Pro will overtake Blur, though users on Twitter have responded favorably to the move. Notably, OpenSea Pro allows OpenSea to cater to seasoned NFT traders while still catering to casual traders on its main platform.  Crypto, but make it fashion: American fashion brand Ralph Lauren has opened a new store in Miami that accepts cryptocurrency as payment, becoming its first store to do so. The store is working with service provider BitPay to allow customers to purchase merchandise using bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH) and Polygon's token, MATIC. While Ralph Lauren has been testing the waters of Web3 for months, integrating crypto payments is a big step forward for the retailer and a potential on-ramp for average customers looking to ease into blockchain payments.  Adding NFTs into the mix: In addition, the brand is working with Web3 community Poolsuite to release co-branded NFTs that will be gifted to existing holders of the Poolsuite NFT membership collection. Members will gain exclusive access to a ""special event"" and be able to update their ""Leisurist"" avatars with digital Ralph Lauren wearables.  Viva VitaDao: Pfizer-backed VitaDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) interested in longevity sciences, has voted in favor of creating a for-profit company to fund its research. The company, to be called VitaTech, plans to license longevity technologies from U.S. universities and research institutions to continue their development and ‚Äúbridge the gap between research and commercialization.‚Äù The execution phase of the project is scheduled for 10 weeks.  The longevity-crypto connection: The DAO previously told CoinDesk that crypto enthusiasts, including Vitalik Buterin, have long been interested in funding research to extend human life. The project closed a $4.1 million funding round in January.  Democratizing healthcare research: According to the proposal, which passed on Thursday, ‚ÄúThere are numerous exciting longevity-related research projects being undertaken in U.S. universities and national labs, but most of these projects never reach the commercialization or investable stage.‚Äù The initiative hopes to democratize and speed up the funding process, potentially transforming the way medical funding is carried out in the U.S.  Projects on the Rise  Nakamigos  Who: Created by anonymous collective HiFo Labs  What: Nakamigos, a 20,000-edition NFT project featuring pixelated avatars, seemed to have appeared overnight and quickly garnered attention across the NFT community on Twitter. Launched last month, the project taps into the name of Bitcoin‚Äôs pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and added the Spanish word for friend ‚Äúamigo‚Äù to create Nakamigos. Within days of its mint, it reportedly outpaced Bored Ape Yacht Club in the number of lifetime trades and has since amassed over 24,000 followers on Twitter despite it presenting no roadmap or long-term plan for holders.  How: The project‚Äôs success has bewildered analysts and traders, though some have chalked it up to clever marketing and a partnership with NFT influencer Sartoshi, creator of the popular mfers NFT collection. The collection allowed holders of the end of Sartoshi (eos) NFT collection to claim free Nakamigos at mint, and heavily promoted a publicity stunt where it gifted 24 NFTs to major crypto influencers including Art Blocks creator Erick Calderon, NFT trader DJ Seedphrase and artist XCOPY that were created in their likeness.  It‚Äôs important to note that the origins and intentions of the project remain shady and much of its trading volume has come from eager holders capitalizing on a trend. But will it last? We took a deep dive into Nakamigos, meme culture and their impact on the NFT market, which you can read here.

Non-Fungible Toolkit  What Is Decentralized File Storage?  Last week we dipped into defining decentralized identity, so we thought we‚Äôd follow it up with Web3‚Äôs answer to cloud-storage giants such as Amazon, Google and Dropbox. Decentralized file storage networks such as Filecoin, Storj and Arweave offer an alternative to trusting all your files to a centralized company.  Instead of storing data with a single cloud company, decentralized file storage protocols cut up your data into tiny pieces, then store packets on pseudonymous computers (nodes) linked up to a decentralized network. Decentralization means that files are protected by a network formed of lots of different stakeholders rather than a single company.

Bitcoin Korea Premium Index Has Declined Into Negative Values Recently As pointed out by an analyst in a CryptoQuant post, past instances of this trend have resulted in pullbacks for the price of the cryptocurrency. The ‚ÄúKorea Premium Index‚Äù is an indicator that measures the difference between the Bitcoin price listed on South Korean exchanges and that listed on foreign platforms. This metric helps us know whether Korean investors are currently buying more or less of the cryptocurrency compared to the investors residing in other parts of the world. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the price listed on the South Korean exchanges is higher than that on the global exchanges right now. Such a trend implies that Korean holders are applying a higher buying pressure (or perhaps just a lower selling pressure) than foreign investors. On the other hand, negative values of the indicator suggest that users of the South Korean exchanges are selling more of the cryptocurrency than the global holders currently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Loss Taking Spikes, Why This Could Be Bullish Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Korea Premium Index over the past year: The value of the metric seems to have declined in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant As shown in the above graph, the Bitcoin Korea Premium Index has had a positive value for much of the current rally that started back in January of this year. This would suggest that the Korean investors have been participating in a heavier amount of buying than the foreign investors. Recently, however, the indicator has been gradually going down, implying that the buying pressure from this segment of the market has been dropping off. Coincidentally, the price of the cryptocurrency has overall moved sideways since this trend formed. In the last few days, the metric has now declined enough to enter into the negative territory, which is a sign that the buying pressure may now have flipped into selling pressure instead. In the chart, the quant has marked the past instances where the Bitcoin Korea Premium Index had assumed some strong negative values. It looks like whenever such values of the indicator appeared, the BTC price observed some decline shortly after. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised To Hit $50,000, This Crypto Expert Predicts Based on this pattern, the cryptocurrency may be at risk of another drawdown in the near future. However, the metric still only has a small negative value so far, while the past declines have generally come when the values have been much lower. This may mean that if the Bitcoin Korean Premium Index doesn‚Äôt decrease further from here, the trend that was seen in the past might not repeat itself.

The token maintains an over 7% price increase on the weekly chart, reflecting its resilience against the ongoing bearish trend. At press time, LDO is trading at $2.54, with a 24-hour price increase of 0.45%. The token is among the few cryptocurrencies holding parallel gains on the weekly and monthly charts. LDO‚Äôs price has increased by more than 73% over the past six months and retained 0.20% of its price gains in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, LDO‚Äôs two-week price gain stands at 9.8%. Probable Reasons For LDO‚Äôs Price Action The cryptocurrency market recovered briefly after several days of downturn caused by bearish macroeconomic conditions. This recovery took Bitcoin above its month-long resistance level to over $27,000 and rubbed off on most coins. Cryptocurrencies like LDO sped up their price action with impressive moves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised To Hit $50,000, This Crypto Expert Predicts Moreover, the Fear and Greed Index remains high at 64, indicating greed in the market as investors scram to accumulate their favorite crypto assets. Even though the global cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by 0.35%, LDO isn‚Äôt backing down. In addition, the liquidity efficiency (Total Value Locked) of LDO has been increasing since April 5. According to data from a crypto tracking website Stelareum, LDO‚Äôs TVL rose from $10.845 billion on April 4 to $11.211 billion on April 5. This means LDO‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) increased by $365.829 million, a 3.37% change within 24 hours. That‚Äôs not all. The TVL continued increasing, adding another 1.39% from $11.211 billion to $11.478 billion on April 6. However, today it is still flat without any notable change. An April 3 tweet by Lido Finance confirms the above data. According to the report, Lido‚Äôs TVL grew moderately over the last week. The tweet cited the growing staking deposits across Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana as a contributing factor. Notably, an increase in TVL could rub off on the crypto prices. As a liquid staking solution, an increase in liquidity efficiency is a positive sign for LDO. That could be among the factors contributing to its current price actions. LDO Price Outlook; Are More Gains Possible? LDO recorded a steady increase on the daily chart despite slight pullbacks. Also, LDO has found strong support at the 38.2 Fib level ($2.527) and is currently trading above it. LDO is trading above its 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a long-term bullish sentiment reflecting the current trend. However, it is falling below its 50-day SMA, indicating the market could lean toward a bearish sentiment in the short term. Related Reading: ADA Records Sharp Decline Despite Cardano‚Äôs First Oracle Integration The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 55.15, in the neutral zone.

Last week, I warned of a dangerous politicization trend in U.S. crypto policy following a barrage of regulatory enforcement actions taken against this industry. I remain concerned about that trend but my view is now slightly more nuanced thanks to the insights of two people with very good D.C. connections. They explained how emotions ‚Äì specifically anger and embarrassment ‚Äì played a huge role in driving those policy actions.  It reminded me of the importance of clear, inviolable rules of governance, whether they‚Äôre baked into democratic institutions such as the U.S. Constitution or forged into consensus mechanisms used by open-source software communities, like those attached to blockchain protocols.

Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  Regulation by retribution  Among a string of ‚ÄúThanks, Sam‚Äù moments these past five months, this one takes the cake. You can argue that the crackdown against Kraken, Coinbase (COIN), Paxos, Binance and others was driven significantly by a desire to punish Sam Bankman-Fried, the erstwhile founder of FTX, whose mind-blowingly rapid collapse in November sent shockwaves through the crypto industry.  This is how one of my sources described the mindset of Biden administration officials and of lawmakers from both political parties: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt come into their house, slosh that kind of money around, leave politicians with egg on their faces and not expect to pay a huge price.‚Äù He was referring to the fact that before the FTX meltdown politicians ‚Äì mostly Democrats but also some Republicans ‚Äì had been beneficiaries of more than $74 million in political donations from FTX and had forged connections with Bankman-Fried, who had wooed progressives with his ‚Äúeffective altruism‚Äù commitments. (A CoinDesk investigation found that one-third of Congress took money from SBF or his associates.)  Virtually no one in this industry would try to diminish Bankman-Fried‚Äôs extensive wrongdoings and most now want tighter regulation. (In fact, the biggest frustration is that SBF‚Äôs actions have set back the chance of a clear regulatory framework, leaving agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission to continue being a law unto themselves.) What‚Äôs so galling is the capricious and utterly disproportionate reaction generated by that malfeasance.  Forget regulation by enforcement; it seems we‚Äôve entered a newly nutty standard of regulation-by-retribution.  Set aside that millions of investors, employees and developers with a stake in the crypto industry are now paying for the sins of a few fraudsters whose behavior they never knew of, let alone condoned. The biggest issue is that because there are very few physical or geographical reasons why blockchain developers would favor one country over another, the U.S. is about to lose all capacity to shape this inherently borderless technology‚Äôs direction. No other developed economy is taking as hostile a stance toward this industry.  There‚Äôs the growing view that digital asset and blockchain innovation ‚Äì now, in the age of artificial intelligence, more important than ever ‚Äì will depart the U.S. for friendlier shores. And there‚Äôs the especially counterproductive concept that if the U.S. wanted to keep the tech away from bad guys in rogue states, it is making that more, not less, likely.  The good news is that this vengeful moment is destined to subside ‚Äì as most emotion-driven overreactions eventually do. Tempers will surely give way to a more grownup approach to policy. Still, the damage already done to the United States‚Äô prospects to attract crypto investment, entrepreneurship and innovation could be profound. U.S. industry leaders of all stripes have been warning of an exodus of crypto businesses.  You see, whether this a ‚Äúwar against crypto‚Äù or just a deliberate bruising, crypto business people are seeing the slew of criminal and civil charges as a message that, in the absence of clear legislative guidance defining what activity is or isn‚Äôt within bounds, it‚Äôs now too risky to keep operating in the U.S.  That message was brought home in two ways. The regulatory actions seemed way too well-sequenced to be coincidental. Then the White House released a scathing report on the industry at the very same moment, one that reversed the open-minded executive order it produced a year ago. It didn‚Äôt help, either, that Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a figurehead of the Democratic Party‚Äôs progressive wing, launched a political campaign that celebrated a Politico headline stating that she‚Äôs forming an ‚Äúanti-crypto army.‚Äù  Who‚Äôs governing the governors?  ‚ÄúD.C. is 'Veep.' It‚Äôs not 'House of Cards'.‚Äù  So said my ""Money Reimagined"" co-host, Sheila Warren, who is also CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation and my second source for this story (the other will remain anonymous), during this week‚Äôs podcast recording.  On the one hand, it‚Äôs comforting to know that we‚Äôre not really at the mercy of some cynical uber-conspiracy orchestrated by the likes of Frank Underwood, the political villain played by Kevin Spacey in ""House of Cards.""  But on the other hand, it‚Äôs sad to know that human fallibility leaves our governing institutions prone to absurd moments like these, as if we‚Äôre permanently subject to the self-absorbed decision-making of people like Vice President Selina Meyer, Julia Louis-Dreyfus‚Äô comically flawed lead character in ""Veep.""  These human failures, both evil and farcical, led French philosopher Montesquieu to conceive of the ‚Äúseparation of powers‚Äù doctrine, a principle of governance designed to protect society‚Äôs interests from the mistakes or corruption of its leaders. Those ideas were then enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and helped shape the Westminster System, with its three, independent branches of government.  They also inform the blockchain idea ‚Äì initially identified in the Bitcoin white paper ‚Äì that we need a system for managing money, assets and information that‚Äôs not beholden to ‚Äútrusted third party‚Äù middlemen. Having to trust intermediaries and representatives will always leave us vulnerable to the problem that they are run by humans, not math.  I‚Äôm no radical advocate of replacing the nation-state with some kind of digital ‚Äúnetwork state,‚Äù but it‚Äôs interesting to think how these new technologies offer people the option to exit into alternative, decentralized economic systems and how, indirectly, this could put pressure on our politicians to lift their game.  It‚Äôs worrying that the ‚Äúwar on crypto‚Äù puts the U.S. and its model of market democracy at greater risk than ever of losing economic and technological leadership. But we can at least take heart that the technology itself might impose a self-correcting force on the political system to avoid the worst outcomes.",NEGATIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | REGULATION | TECHNOLOGY,Michael J.

Here‚Äôs why this could turn out to be bullish for the asset‚Äôs price. Bitcoin Loss-Taking Volume Has Been More Than The Profit-Taking One Recently According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, traders are currently taking losses at twice the rate of profits. The relevant indicator here is the ‚Äúratio of daily transaction volume in profit to loss,‚Äù which, as its name already suggests, tells us about how the per day Bitcoin profit-taking volume compares with the loss-taking one. Something to note is that this metric only measures profits and losses that have been realized (‚Äútaken‚Äù). This only happens when an investor moves or sells their coins at a price different than what they bought them at. Coins that are carrying some profit or loss, but are yet to be sold, are said to be holding an ‚Äúunrealized profit/loss.‚Äù Related Reading: Woes For Bitcoin And Ethereum As Price Weakens, Which Direction Will Prevail? When the value of this metric is positive, it means the profit-taking volumes are currently overwhelming the loss-taking ones. Such a trend suggests that the investors as a whole are realizing some profit with their selling right now. On the other hand, a negative value implies that losses are dominating the market currently, and hence, a majority of the holders are participating in loss realization. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the ratio of daily transaction volume in profit to loss for Bitcoin, as well as for Ethereum, over the last few months: Looks like the value of the metric has plunged in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, the ratio of transaction volume in profit to loss had been highly positive for both Bitcoin and Ethereum just a while back when the prices had been surging. This spike in profit-taking made sense as investors generally like to harvest some gains when the price observes rapid growth. Following this profit selling, however, the rally came to a halt and the cryptocurrencies have been mostly consolidating since then. Recently, the indicator‚Äôs value has plunged for both Bitcoin and Ethereum and for the first time in five weeks, it has turned red. This implies that the holders are now participating in mass loss-taking. The plummet has been sharper for BTC, with the metric‚Äôs value falling to about -0.45. This value suggests that loss realization is currently happening at a rate almost double that of the profits. Related Reading: Bitcoin Older Than 5 Years Abruptly Moves, Bearish Sign? Santiment notes that this trend could actually be a good sign for the asset as it shows the FOMOers who bought at high prices have started to give up on the rally. The coins that these holders are selling may end up in the hands of investors with a stronger conviction, hence providing a more solid bullish foundation. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $27,900, up 1% in the last week.

11515000,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=525991,1680872703,"How Liquid Are Litecoin, Chainlink And XRP? Traders Need To See This Report","Operation Choke Point 2.0 has deprived the crypto industry in the United States of crucial fiat payment channels. As NewsBTC reported, the liquidity of the Bitcoin market is near historic lows, but what about altcoins such as Litecoin (LTC), Chainlink (LINK) and XRP? To that end, Kaiko, a digital asset data provider, has released a new study. For traders, the research is a must-read to assess how volatile each crypto asset is based on its liquidity. And the study has a few surprises in store. Besides BTC, Which Cryptocurrencies Are Most Liquid? At the beginning of the report, Conor Ryder, research analyst at Kaiko, notes that market depth is at a 10-month low because of OCP 2.0 and due to market makers having to pull their orders from exchanges. ‚Äú[S]o it is essential investors can accurately evaluate the liquidity of each individual asset to gain an understanding of how much short term volatility to expect,‚Äù Ryder explains. Overall, Kaiko examined data on the 29 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens. To define a liquidity rank, three criteria are used: volumes, market depth and spreads. For volume and market depth, data from all active USD, BUSD, USDT and USDC pairs on 11 of the most liquid centralized exchanges were combined. For spreads, Kaiko uses only data from Binance, the most liquid exchange with the widest range of markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Poised To Hit $50,000, This Crypto Expert Predicts In terms of volumes, Dogecoin and Litecoin were the most conspicuous cryptos in the first quarter of 2023. As the chart below shows, DOGE ranks an impressive third behind BTC and ETH, ahead of several tokens with larger market capitalizations. Litecoin ranks 4th, despite having only the 11th largest market cap (excluding stablecoins). ‚ÄúThe cautionary note with LTC volumes is that earlier this year I found some examples of LTC wash trading on Bitforex so the volume figure alone is not enough to conclude that LTC is particularly liquid,‚Äù the analyst states. Chainlink also outperforms its rank by market capitalization and lands in 13th place by trading volume after all. In terms of market depth, XRP and Solana stand out positively in the subsequent places behind BTC and ETH. Litecoin is again in a very good fifth place, while LINK ranks a respectable 12th. BNB, on the other hand, is a negative surprise. ‚ÄúBNB depth is surprisingly low again, considering it is the native token of the most liquid exchange, remaining in tenth despite being the third largest non-stablecoin token,‚Äù notes Ryder, who also discusses that the lower the market depth, the easier it is for larger market orders to influence the price. Related Reading: Why Litecoin Could Be Gearing Up For Its Greatest Rally Since 2017 In traditional finance, spreads are the most commonly used indicator for assessing the liquidity of a market. Generally, the smaller the spread, the more liquid the market. In this category, Polygon (MATIC) and ATOM impress, ranking ahead of Ethereum (ETH). Disappointing, on the other hand, are once again BNB, which gets a 21st place in terms of spreads on its own exchange, and Solana, which ranks 16th, despite being the 8th largest non-stable token by market cap. How Do Litecoin, LINK and XRP Fare Overall? There are definitely surprises in the ranking of the overall liquidity, which results from the three liquidity ratios mentioned above. In general, the rule is that the smaller the amount of a metric to its score, the better its liquidity. Behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, MATIC and Litecoin occupy the best places and are thus less susceptible to the influence of larger orders. XRP lands in 6th place, Chainlink in 8th, making them also generally prone to less volatility. Ryder also highlights Aptos: APT liquidity far exceeded its market cap, implying that it is one of the most liquid tokens relative to its size and should benefit from less volatility as a result. LEO and BNB, on the other hand, give Kaiko‚Äôs analyst cause for concern. The market capitalization of the two exchange tokens is far excessive in relation to their liquidity ‚Äì ‚Äù a similar situation to FTT who‚Äôs illiquidity played a role in the collapse of FTX.‚Äù At press time, the Litecoin price stood at $90.30. Thus, LTC is still writing higher lows in the 4-hour chart, maintaining its upward trend.

Van de Poppe is confident that Bitcoin will make significant gains, with his projections even suggesting that the top cryptocurrency could hit $50,000.

To overcome this hurdle, he suggests that a sweep in support is necessary, with the critical level being at $27,600. If the support holds, Bitcoin could potentially bounce back up and continue its ascent until either $27,600 or $28,600 is tested again.

Cardano Gets First-Ever Oracle Integration On April 6, Charli3, an open-source decentralized Oracle launched on the Cardano blockchain via integration with Liqwid, a leading decentralized interest rate protocol for lending and borrowing on Cardano. Viewed as the Cardano Version of Chainlink, Charlie3 would now be able to provide the ecosystem with necessary secure, safe, and accurate data. According to the Cardano ecosystem ambassador, Yevhen, this move is a ‚Äúmajor occasion‚Äù for the blockchain. Yevhen noted: This is a MAJOR occasion for the Cardano ecosystem as a whole, showing that projects are following the continuous push for complete decentralization in Cardano. So far, with the integration with Liqwid, Charlie3 can now supply Cardano with accurate on-chain feeds. Currently, the Oracle protocol only supports prices for SHEN/ADA. According to the announcement, ADA/USD will be the next price feed integrated with Oracle. Related Reading: Cardano Poised For 30% Uptrend, But Must Breach This Barrier First ‚ÄúUsing Charli3 Oracles, Liqwid is paving the way to expand decentralization and security within Cardano DeFi, setting the best example for new projects building on Cardano to focus on security, reliability, and safety,‚Äù Yevhen added. This latest achievement from Cardano is a monumental milestone for the blockchain as it now allows several projects looking to create an oracle needed project to build on the blockchain. For instance, Liqwid will now be able to use the Charli3 oracle protocol for its services such as executing liquidations for under-collateralized loans, calculations to create new loans, and updating collateral values. ADA Records Sharp Decline In the Last 24 Hours After moving in an uptrend a few days before today‚Äôs bearish trend, ADA is currently in red down by 2% in the last 24 hours. The asset‚Äôs price has moved from trading as high as above $0.4 on Monday to trading below that price range at the time of writing following its bearish trend from the beginning of the day.

The Bangkok Post reports that real estate mogul turned candidate Srettha Thavisin promises a basic-income style economic stimulus package via ‚Äúdigital currency‚Äù should his party, Pheu Thai, win the next election.  Thavisin says the measure will provide some economic relief to Thais that are trapped with some of the highest household debt in the region.  ‚ÄúOur country has been economically bruised over the last eight years, with less income and more expenses for the people,‚Äù Thavisin is quoted by Bloomberg as saying. ‚ÄúThe current government has been feeding IV drips with small money handouts. That‚Äôs not the right way and doesn‚Äôt stimulate the appropriate and right economic growth.‚Äù  A Phue Thai spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment via Twitter on what tokens will be used for the airdrop.  In 2021 the Bank of Thailand, the nation‚Äôs central bank, declared Thai baht stablecoins to be illegal.  The Bangkok Post quotes Thanakorn Wangboonkongchana, a minister in the prime minister's office, as saying that the airdrop proposal would have ‚Äúmajor implications‚Äù for the entire country‚Äôs financial system.  Others quoted by the Bangkok Post question if this would be the best use of funds instead of putting it towards alleviating poverty.  Recent polls show the election is going to be a close one, with Reuters reporting Pheu Thai has approximately 46% of the vote in recent polls.  This isn‚Äôt the first election in Asia where crypto has played a prominent role.  In South Korea‚Äôs March 2022 election, one of the closest in the country‚Äôs history, Conservative Party candidate Yoon Suk-Yeol, now the president, put crypto deregulation on his list of legislative proposals to edge ahead of his opponent and win office by a margin of less than 1%.

As reported by crypto tracking service WhaleStats, the unknown grand owner of Shiba Inu with the synonym ‚ÄúBlueWhale0073‚Äù has continued his buying spree over the last three days. Yesterday, ‚ÄúBlueWhale0073‚Äù acquired 148.78 billion SHIB worth around $1.65 million in a single transaction. Just a short time earlier, on April 4 the 254th largest Ethereum whale bought 229.96 billion SHIB worth around $2.58 million, as reported by WhaleStats. The total number of Shiba Inu bought by the whale in the last 72 hours has thus reached the eye-popping number of 378.74 billion SHIB worth $4.23 million. Nevertheless, the buying pressure from the unknown SHIB investor has not been enough to move SHIB upward against the market trends. Nevertheless, Ethereum whales continue to believe in a rising price of SHIB. In their last update at the end of March, WhaleStats reported that SHIB remains by far the most popular investment next to stablecoins among ETH whales. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Fundamentals Look Strong, When Will SHIB Price Follow? The top 2000 ETH whales hodl a total of $606.55 million in SHIB. Coming in second by a wide margin is MATIC, in which whales poured $167.71 million. It is followed by BEST ($155.92 million), LINK ($149.43 million), CHSB ($131.74 million) and UNI ($96.22 million) Can Shiba Inu Continue Its Upward Trend? After Shiba Inu experienced an extremely powerful early-year rally that saw price rise from $0.00000802 to as high as $0.00001588 on February 4, the price fell back down by mid-March. After reaching the high, the buying pressure was not enough to keep propelling the SHIB price higher. However, since the local low on March 10 at $0.00000965, the Shiba price has been able to form an uptrend again. SHIB has formed an ascending triangle in the 1-day chart, which is one of the consolidation formations. This means that the previous trend direction could be resumed after a consolidation phase. Currently, the price of $0.00001151 acts as a horizontal resistance line. SHIB has failed to break this crucially important resistance in seven attempts so far. Related Reading: Shiba Inu: Market Stability At Pivotal Point As Buyers Hold Strong At This Level However, the buyers are still stronger than the sellers as higher lows are currently being formed. Due to the market-wide retracement, SHIB has lost momentum again in the last two days, but continues to form higher lows. Thus, the uptrend remains intact. For a breakout from the triangle, it needs an increasing trading volume. If the breakout occurs under low volume, it may be a false signal, as some of the last attempts showed.

The California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation (DFPI) has joined the multi-state settlement, which followed a North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) investigation into Robinhood platform outages in March 2020.  ""In addition, prior to March 2021, there were deficiencies at Robinhood in its review and approval process for options and margin accounts, weaknesses in the firm‚Äôs monitoring and reporting tools, and insufficient customer service and escalation protocols that in some cases left Robinhood users unable to process trades even as the value of certain stocks was dropping,"" the DFPI said.  The investigation was spearheaded by securities regulators in California, Alabama, Colorado, Delaware, New Jersey, South Dakota and Texas.  This isn't Robinhood's first multi-million dollar penalty. In 2021, Robinhood's crypto arm said it was set to pay a $30 million settlement to the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) over violations of regulatory requirements. This came after a $65 million payment to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 to settle allegations the platform misled investors. The platform was also slapped with a $70 million fine by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) for failing to protect customers.

42412379,PU3faaK1X8MGOraUJl4nLy,1680836400,Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes Calls His Maelstrom Capital a ‚ÄòVery Patient‚Äô Fund,"Arthur Hayes and Akshat Vaidya are looking to beat bitcoin and ether‚Äôs returns, but they are going to take their time doing it.  Hayes, the former CEO of crypto exchange BitMEX, and Vaidya, BitMEX‚Äôs former head of corporate development, founded Maelstrom, where Vaidya serves as head of investments. In an interview with CoinDesk, Hayes and Vaidya said that Maelstrom is currently targeting infrastructure companies ‚Äúas that‚Äôs what makes sense in this part of the cycle‚Äù.  ""Nothing scales like consumer, but we're not quite at the phase where there's enough infrastructure to support that,‚Äù Vaidya said.  Maelstrom is set up as Hayes' family office, using a pool of his crypto and fiat money. Because there are no liquidity providers to answer to ‚Äì as it's Hayes‚Äô money ‚Äì there‚Äôs no rush to deploy capital to earn management fees so the firm can be ‚Äúpatient.‚Äù  ‚ÄúWe want to identify projects that are actually quality,‚Äù Hayes said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a game of spray-and-pray because we don‚Äôt have outside LPs.‚Äù  Infrastructure deals have ‚Äústrong technological moats that are addressing a large market, and it's simple to understand business: It's 'P' multiplied by market size,‚Äù explains Vaidya.  Good firms are founded in the bear market  Compound, Aave, and Uniswap were all founded in 2017, but they didn‚Äôt appear on anyone‚Äôs radar until 2019 and weren‚Äôt mainstream until the decentralized finance (DeFi) summer of 2020.  ‚ÄúAt the time, no one cared about them due to the negativity around [initial coin offerings] and the massive bear market,‚Äù Hayes said. ‚ÄúThis led to a surge of projects claiming to be the next Uniswap, Compound,or Aave, but many were based on something less substantial. Investors were willing to put money into these projects, knowing they could exit in a few months after getting their tokens,‚Äù Hayes added.  Hayes thinks the turning point for the projects in which he‚Äôs investing now will likely come sometime around 2024 when the market starts to question whether these projects have fulfilled their promises, built their products, acquired clients, and demonstrated that their technology works.  And with that comes clone projects and their ""me too"" investors, just like what happened during the COVID-19 bull market of 2020-2021, when clones of Uniswap, Compound and Aave became flush with capital.  ‚ÄúIn this part of the cycle, it's important to make money but also to have done the work during the bear market to identify which companies are genuinely valuable and which are just imitations,‚Äù Hayes said.  Some of these did well, and some of them were ""[excrement] coins"" ‚Äì which Hayes has no qualms investing in when the time comes because that‚Äôs how crypto-tier returns are made when the market shifts from bear to bull.  ‚ÄúWe're not saying that we're always going to invest in pure quality, we'll invest in a complete piece of [dog excrement] because we get our tokens today,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd in three months' time, we could dump them because the narrative is there.‚Äù  BUIDLing during a crypto war  In some ways, Hayes might have been the opening salvo ‚Äì or the first victim ‚Äì of the U.S. government‚Äôs war on crypto.  In 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice alleged that Hayes violated the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and allowed money laundering to occur on the BitMEX platform by not implementing know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) controls. In February 2022, Hayes and BitMEX co-founder Ben Delo pleaded guilty to the charges.  The guilty plea means the evidence and arguments the government had on Hayes, et. al. were never tested in the adversarial environment of a courtroom. BitMEX is not a U.S. company, nor did it use U.S. dollars. As legal experts highlighted at the time, the only other instance of when the BSA was used on a non-bank financial institution ended with a deferred prosecution agreement ‚Äì no prosecution in exchange for a mending of ways.  So, of course, the long reach of U.S. regulators is on the mind of Hayes and Vaidya.  ‚ÄúThe advantage of investing in infrastructure projects, especially at this cycle, is that a lot of those aren't really in the crosshairs of regulators to the extent that others might be,‚Äù Vaidya said.  One example of this, according to Vaidya, is their portfolio company EtherFi, a decentralized and non-custodial liquid staking platform, which closed a $5 million round in February.  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody to go after because it's noncustodial,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis company will never get a Wells Notice.‚Äù  All of Maelstrom‚Äôs portfolio companies, bar one, which doesn‚Äôt have a token model, have been outside of the U.S.  Even when a project does involve U.S. founders, it is domiciled in a friendly jurisdiction like Switzerland, Vaidya explains.  ‚ÄúSo no preference per se, but I think the market itself is just doing its thing,‚Äù he said.",POSITIVE,ÏóÜÏùå,BUSINESS | MARKET | TRADING | UNI | TOKEN SALE,Sam Reynolds,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/04/07/former-bitmex-ceo-arthur-hayes-calls-his-maelstrom-capital-a-very-patient-fund,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/38eb02459e42cc8a4e6ae36bbd71b21663a080b4-720x406.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The world‚Äôs largest digital asset is flat to $28,067, while ether is in the red down 1% to $1,878.  Brent Xu, CEO of DeFi lender Umee, thinks there‚Äôs a gap between the market reality, and what the market wants to think.  On a recent appearance on CoinDesk TV, Xu pointed out that the mini-bull market that‚Äôs been forming since January 2023 has been largely driven by positive sentiment.  ‚ÄúThis is driven by three factors: tamed inflation, the market's belief that there will be no future interest rate increases, and the avoidance of a banking crisis,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs what the market wants to think.‚Äù  But the wild card here is interest rates, especially if they continue to rise.  ‚ÄúThere's a big battle between the bulls and the bears right now,‚Äù he said on CoinDesk TV. ‚ÄúThere's not as much liquidity and depth around, so that's why you see these volatile moves right now.‚Äù  Next week the latest Consumer Price Index is scheduled to be released, which is key to determining inflation and thus directs the Fed‚Äôs hand on interest rates.  That‚Äôll be a good update in the battle of bulls and bears.

So this is how mass adoption happens? Elon Musk, at least at one point the world‚Äôs richest man, replaced Twitter‚Äôs classic blue bird logo with a sprite of DOGE, the Shiba Inu dog known as much for the meme as the meme coin. Dogecoin spiked something like 40%, and hasn‚Äôt yet crashed. I hear there‚Äôs excitement brewing that DOGE could pump above the 10 cents threshold, which is proportionately one-tenth as exciting as when the so-called proletariat investors of the GameStop era attempted to drive dogecoin, sometimes un-ironically called ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs cryptocurrency,‚Äù past $1 (it didn‚Äôt work).  Dogecoin is apparently spiking because people believe that Elon Musk could soon integrate a permanent dogecoin payment system on Twitter, the microblogging platform he overpaid for ($43 billion). Twitter has several million daily active users, many of them high-profile, and if even just a small percentage begin transacting in DOGE ‚Äì as a joke or not ‚Äì it‚Äôs not completely irrational to speculate on that translating into a higher price. Mind you, Twitter already has payment/tipping features using the U.S. dollar and the Bitcoin Lightning network. The latter is rarely used, which gives some indication of how frequently the even-less-widely adopted and even-less-trusted crypto, dogecoin, would (or wouldn‚Äôt) be used.  Of course, this is my attempt to ascribe meaning to crypto price moves. Prices are basically the only thing that matter in crypto, but rarely for any reason investors typically rely on when evaluating the expected return of an asset. Instead, crypto prices are almost a perfect reflection of market sentiment ‚Äì or, to put it in the people‚Äôs language, vibe. The coronavirus shutting down the global economy? Bad vibes. Locked-down workers with excess cash turning into slap-happy day traders? Fun vibes. A massive stablecoin experiment crashing and burning? Bad vibes. The collapse of the U.S. banking revealing Bitcoin‚Äôs virtues? Apparently good vibes.  Elon Musk has manipulated the price of dogecoin in the past. The first time it happened, in early 2020, DOGE jumped after the Tesla founder tweeted out a meme. He apparently got a taste of something he enjoys ‚Äì power through s**tposting ‚Äì because he pulled similar moves again and again, each time raising the stakes as the joke grew stale. He weighed in on a dispute between DOGE traders and crypto exchange Binance. Tesla, his car company, would allow DOGE payments. Musk planned to bring DOGE to space, with a SpaceX satellite launch. Over 30-some tweets up to the end of 2022, Musk pumped the price of DOGE by 4.5% on average, according to crypto-skeptical news site Protos.
