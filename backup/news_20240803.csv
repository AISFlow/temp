31918094,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632974,1722726030,Wondering When To Buy Bitcoin? Here Are The Levels To Watch,"Due to market volatility and Bitcoin (BTC) price fluctuations, identifying the best times to buy the pioneer cryptocurrency can be challenging. Taking this into consideration, a crypto analyst has pinpointed key price levels for investors to monitor for potential buying opportunities. Buy Levels To Watch For The Bitcoin Price A crypto analyst identified as ‘Stockmoney Lizards’ took to X (formerly Twitter) on August 1 to discuss Bitcoin’s recent price movements, highlighting key buy levels and the cryptocurrency’s propensity for a price increase. The analyst notes that Bitcoin’s current price actions indicate a classic 5-wave uptrend followed by an ABC correction with an overarching wave B. Related Reading: Fox’s Tucker Carlson Drops Bombshell: Did The CIA Create Bitcoin? An ABC correction is a continuous pattern that occurs during uptrends or downtrends. It is a pattern within the Elliott Wave Theory that reflects a three wave correction and helps identify a trend continuation. Sharing a Bitcoin price chart illustrating each wave (A, B, and C), the analyst disclosed that Wave B ended at the Value Area High (VAH) around the $69,885 mark. According to the analyst, this price level historically acted as a resistance. This means that Bitcoin’s price may face difficulty moving above this point. The analyst further revealed that the $66,745 price point also acted as a resistance level for Bitcoin. He highlighted this critical level on the BTC price chart, emphasizing that the red line represents a Point Of Control (POC) for the cryptocurrency. Moreover, the 1.618 Fibonacci extension level for Bitcoin is identified as a potential support area for a new uptrend. The analyst disclosed that this crucial level coincides with the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level and the Value Area Low (VAL), which are all important support levels. Concluding his analysis, the crypto analyst suggested that the support area between $61,800 and $62,300 was an important buying level to watch out for. He noted that on the higher timeframe, Bitcoin’s potential uptrend was still intact, adding that if the cryptocurrency’s price breaks below the $61,800 mark, then a further decline to test the 2.618 Fibonacci extension at $56,800 should be expected. Overall, the crypto analyst is leaning towards a bullish outlook for the short term and mid term timeframes in Bitcoin’s price. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $61,594, reflecting a 4.21% decline in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. BTC Poised To Breakout In September Other analysts have also remained relatively bullish on Bitcoin’s price, predicting rallies to new all-time highs for the pioneer cryptocurrency. According to a crypto analyst identified as ‘TOBTC’ on X, Bitcoin experienced a significant decline in its price, falling below the $63,000 price mark. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns That Bitcoin Could Crash To $42,000 If This Happens The analyst revealed that despite Bitcoin getting rejected at the $70,000 resistance, a potential breakout is expected by September. This bullish sentiment is shared by a different crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe, who predicts that if Bitcoin holds above $60,000 to $61,000, the cryptocurrency could witness an upward movement to new all time highs in September or October 2024.

31910287,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632949,1722715230,"Ethereum Price Crashes Below $3,000 As Revenues Drop To New Lows","Ethereum (ETH) recently dropped below the critical and psychological support level at $3,000, raising concerns for ETH bulls. This development comes amid the continued decline in revenue generated on the Ethereum network. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns That Bitcoin Could Crash To $42,000 If This Happens Ethereum Crashes Below $3,000 Ethereum is down below $3,000, with this downtrend believed to be due to several factors. One is the outflows, which the Spot Ethereum ETFs have been experiencing since they began trading on July 23. Data from Farside Investors shows that these funds again experienced a net outflow of $54.3 million on August 2. These funds haven’t had the desired impact on ETH’s price that they were expected to have, with Ethereum down over 10% since they began trading. Data from Soso Value shows that these funds have suffered cumulative net outflows of $510.7 million since they launched. Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) has been individually responsible for these outflows, with $2.12 billion flowing out of the fund since its launch. This has put significant selling pressure on ETH, leading to its recent downtrend. ETH’s price has also dropped below $3,000 thanks to the downtrend in the broader crypto market led by Bitcoin. Ethereum was bound to suffer a significant decline following Bitcoin’s drop as data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock shows that both assets currently have a strong price correlation. Ethereum’s drop below $3,000 is undoubtedly worrisome for investors, considering how much lower it could drop. However, ETH has quickly reclaimed the $3,000 level these past three months whenever it drops below this crucial support zone. As such, this time may not be any different, especially with data from IntoTheBlock indicating a strong demand for Ethereum at this price level. If Ethereum fails to hold this range, the second-largest crypto token risks dropping to as low as $2,700, a more crucial support zone for ETH considering that 11.11 million addresses bought the token at an average price of $2,647. Ethereum’s Revenue Drops To New Lows Data from Token Terminal shows that Ethereum’s revenue has dropped to new lows, down by 40.4% in the last 30 days and 44.8% annually. Fees earned on the network have not been impressive either. Over the last 30 days, Ethereum users have paid $92.97 million in fees, a 32.8% decline and 38.3% at an annual rate. This drop in Ethereum’s revenue and fees can be attributed to the decline in the network’s active daily users. Further data from Token Terminal shows a 9.8% drop in Ethereum’s monthly active users. The same goes for the weekly and daily active users, with 20.1% and 15.3% drops, respectively.

31905315,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632948,1722708015,AVAX On Thin Ice: $21.73 Support Under Siege – What’s Next?,"Recent market activities for Avalanche (AVAX) indicate that the bears have gained control over the market, pushing the cryptocurrency toward a critical price target of $21.73. With the bears dominating and market sentiment leaning heavily toward further declines, the $21.73 level has become a key point of interest for market participants. This analysis delves into AVAX’s current bearish trend by examining key technical indicators such as Moving Averages and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Additionally, it highlights the significance of the $21.73 support level and its potential impact on AVAX’s price movement As of the time of writing, AVAX’s price has decreased by 4.67%, trading at approximately $23.75 over the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of $9 billion and a trading volume of $331 million. AVAX’s market cap has declined by 6.37% in the past day, while its trading volume has increased by 15.60%. Analyzing Recent Price Trends And Performance Of AVAX Avalanche has shown significant bearish strength, with multiple bearish candlesticks forming below the 4-hour 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). This indicates bearish dominance and suggests continued downward pressure, potentially leading to further declines toward $21.75. Also, on the 4-hour chart, both the signal line and the MACD line of the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) are trending below the zero line and are currently attempting to move into the oversold zone. This supports the potential for continued downward movement in AVAX’s price. Technical analysis on the 1-day chart reveals that AVAX has been on a bearish trajectory toward a critical support level at $21.75, marked by the formation of multiple bearish candlesticks. Furthermore, the crypto asset’s price is trading below the 100-day SMA, suggesting a bearish market sentiment. Looking at the 1-day chart, it can be observed that the Signal line has crossed below the MACD line and both have recently dropped below the zero line, which implies a continued bearish trend and indicates the chance for further price declines. Significance Of The $21.73 Support Level Assessing the significance of the $21.73 support level suggests that: If AVAX reaches this level, it might break through or consolidate and retrace. A successful break below could lead to further price decline, potentially driving the asset toward the $18.83 support level and beyond. However, if the price consolidates and retraces upward upon reaching the $21.73 support level, it will begin to climb toward the $30.34 resistance point. Should the price break through this range, it could lead to further gains, testing a higher resistance level at $37.29 and potentially increasing bullish sentiment.

Despite the recent significant decline in the cryptocurrency’s price, the analyst remains confident in the future outlook of XRP. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Warns That Bitcoin Could Crash To $42,000 If This Happens XRP Gears Up For 1,000X Surge A crypto analyst identified as ‘Mickle’ on X (formerly Twitter) has shared bullish insights on XRP’s future value, emphasizing the cryptocurrency’s potential to break out of bearish trends and witness a massive rally to new highs. During his video post, Mickle revealed that XRP could witness a substantial bullish surge of 1,000X soon. This means that the crypto analyst expects XRP’s price to rise from its current value of $0.57 to $570 in this bullish cycle. The analyst has based his ambitious predictions on a positive regulatory change in the United States. According to Mickle, the US is set to witness a massive political shift that could favor the industry by providing clear regulations for cryptocurrencies to prosper. As a result, prominent cryptocurrencies including XRP are poised for a major breakout. Mickle disclosed that the cryptocurrency community has endured an extremely hostile environment in the US, marked by numerous leading regulatory agencies taking seemingly aggressive enforcement actions against the industry. Despite these challenges, the analyst indicated that the crypto space has shown remarkable resilience and tenacity, emerging stronger after winning multiple court cases and successfully pushing for pro crypto legislation. Despite the recent decline in the price of XRP, Mickle continues to remain bullish, doubling down on his predictions in his most recent posts. According to the analyst, XRP’s price movement is currently in the process of finishing a massive formation similar to a symmetrical triangle pattern seen between 2013 to 2017. Mickle highlighted that during XRP’s triangle formation from 2013 to 2017, the cryptocurrency faced multiple declines and bearish sentiments. However, despite the downtrend, XRP experienced an unexpected surge, reaching new price levels. Based on this analysis, the crypto analyst suggests that XRP is currently in a similar bearish trend but with a bullish outlook ahead. He believes that if XRP successfully completes this symmetrical triangle pattern, it could potentially witness an exponential breakout to the upside. XRP Price Plummets Below $0.6 Earlier this week, XRP’s price was trading above the $0.6 mark, displaying a strong tendency to break out of bearish trends and continue its upward momentum. However, in the last 24 hours, the cryptocurrency has dipped by a massive 10%, presently trading at a price of $0.57. According to CoinMarketCap, XRP has also recorded a sharp decline of 4.2% over the past seven days. This unexpected price dip comes as the legal battle between Ripple and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) nears conclusion.

31895338,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632929,1722693605,"Ethereum Price Under Pressure: Here’s Why $3,000 Is A Critical Level","The Ethereum price has been under intense bearish pressure over the past few weeks, continuing in a downward spiral over the last seven-day period. This horrid run of form has persisted despite the recent launch of spot ETH ETFs. According to recent on-chain data, the price of the altcoin seems to be approaching a significant level. This recent price action begs the question — is the Ethereum price in make-or-break season? 1.7 Million Addresses Purchased ETH At $3,000 – Here’s The Relevance In a recent post on the X platform, market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock revealed that the price of Ethereum is currently on its way down to $3,000, which has proven to be a crucial support level in the past. The rationale behind this evaluation revolves around the average cost basis of several ETH investors. Related Reading: ‘Not All Hope Is Lost’: Crypto Analyst Weighs In On The Market’s Performance The above chart highlights the distribution of tokens around the current Ethereum price, according to data from IntoTheBlock. The size of the dots corresponds with the amount of tokens bought within a price range while reflecting the significance and strength of each level. As shown in the chart, there seems to be increased buying activity whenever the ETH price approaches the $2,913 – $3,000 zone, indicating the importance of the price range. Based on recent data from IntoTheBlock, more than 1.7 million addresses acquired ETH tokens in the price region just below $3,000. Consequently, the level of buying activity has led to the formation of critical support within this price bracket. IntoTheBlock noted in their post on X: As $ETH dips below, will we witness a surge in demand? Most investors are likely to defend their cost basis by purchasing more tokens should the Ethereum price fall to the $3,000 range. Meanwhile, fresh investors might look to acquire tokens at this level as it has been a historical turnaround point for the price of ETH. On the flip side, if the $3,000 price range fails to hold, then investors might see the “king of altcoins” continue its downturn to as low as $2,800. Considering the relatively lesser strength of this next support, the Ethereum price could fall further down to $2,600. Ethereum Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of ETH stands at around $2,988, reflecting an almost 7% decline in the last 24 hours. This past-day performance underscores the cryptocurrency’s woes in the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, Ethereum is down by 9% in the last seven days.

This negative price action brings the asset’s net gain over the last month to a mere 0.20%, indicating a period equally influenced by both buyers and sellers. As Bitcoin now attempts to find a support level, blockchain analytics platform CryptoQuant has revealed certain elating developments in the token mining space. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Capitulation Comes To An End – Time To Buy BTC? Bitcoin Miners Hashrate 2% Away From Network ATH On Friday, CryptoQuant shared on X that the Bitcoin miner hashrate has been on the rise this last week, reaching as high as 604 exhashes/second (EH/S). According to the analytics team, this value represents a 6% gain from the lows on July 9 but remains 2% off the network’s current all-time high hashrate value. Cryptoquant report states that Bitcoin miners are currently enjoying a better pay condition compared to April as daily mining revenues have grown by over 50% since early July, thus reducing the need to offload their assets. This is proven evidently as daily Bitcoin miner outflows stayed between approximately 5000 – 10,000 BTC in July, showing a notable decrease from the range of 10,000 – 20,000 BTC seen in early March when Bitcoin reached the $70,000 price mark. Generally, the Bitcoin hashrate measures the total computational power used to mine and process transactions on the Bitcoin network. It is a crucial indicator of miners’ confidence in BTC, with an increase signaling belief in mining the token due to profitability from current or future prices. However, the ability of Bitcoin miners to sustain their recent performances despite the token’s recent dip could prove pivotal in initiating a market price rebound, especially as a sell-off by these miners could further drive down the token’s price. Nevertheless, a future decline in hashrate is a more likely scenario as miners’ profitability is largely depends on Bitcoin’s price in addition to network fees. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miners Slow Down Selling In July, What This Could Mean For Price BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $61,387 with a loss of 5.05% in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is barely up by 5.35% and is valued at $42.9 billion. Historical price data indicates BTC may currently be in the support zone, however, any further decline past this level could result in prices as low as $55,000 as seen in early July. Alternatively, if the crypto market eventually finds some stability in this zone, a return to the $70,000 price zone is on the cards.

Related Reading: ARB Market Plummets 14%, But New Developments Could Reverse The Trend For Solana, the sharp swings in the market have presented a difficult picture; nevertheless, experts still have optimism. They see this as a passing phase even with the downward pressures. The altcoin’s technical developments point to an interesting future. At the time of writing, SOL was trading at $150, down 6.2% and 17.1% in the daily and weekly frames, data from Coingecko shows. Even within the turmoil, the recent trading volume of $9.80 billion over the past 24 hours demonstrates a notable degree of activity and investor interest. Technical Indicators And Bullish Patterns Ali Martinez, a famous crypto analyst, recently talked about Solana’s possible return, which makes dealers and buyers very interested. Martinez’s study indicates on Solana’s 4-hour chart a bullish megaphone pattern developing. This trend, which shows growing volatility, usually comes before significant price increases. I know, the dip keeps dipping! However, #Solana might be forming a bullish megaphone on the 4-hour chart. The recent correction to the 61.8% Fibonacci level and oversold RSI suggest it could be a good time to buy $SOL. Consider placing your stop-loss around $156-$154 and… pic.twitter.com/ylnaPAf2EV — Ali (@ali_charts) August 1, 2024 One of the main signs that could validate Solana’s positive outlook is the digital asset’s adaptation to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracing level. Highly important in technical analysis, the Fibonacci retrace aids in the estimation of probable support and resistance levels. Especially the said level is viewed as a tipping point when normal market fluctuations are expected. To reduce risk, Martinez recommends establishing a stop-loss order between $156 and $154, therefore guaranteeing that, should the price fall to this predefined level, holdings are instantly liquidated. This approach seeks to minimize possible losses and set investors to profit from the anticipated increasing trend. Conversely, Martinez’s take-profit objective is from $200 to $259, therefore providing a significant profit margin for those ready to negotiate the present dynamics of the market with measured risks. Long-Term Prospects And Strategic Positioning Although the market for cryptocurrencies is inherently volatile, Solana’s long-term prospects are very bright. SOL is selling at a 14.59% discount to its expected estimate for the next month based on data from the crypto prediction tool CoinCheckup. This underperformance points to possible undervaluation, thereby offering investors ready for a comeback a window of opportunity. From what CoinCheckup can tell, prices will go up by 2.91 percent over the next three months. This is the start of a healing time. Even though this projected rise is small, it sets the stage for bigger ones. Related Reading: Render Continues To Flash Red In All Timeframes – What’s Going On? Things are looking up for Solana: prediction data show it is poised to rally 80% over the next six months. This projection is probably based on the notion that the network will improve, more people will use it, and the market will be growing.

Trump’s Strategy To Tackle $35 Trillion Debt With Bitcoin “Crypto is a very interesting thing, very high level in certain ways, intellectually very high level,” Trump said.

As part of the initial distribution, BTC creditors will receive 51.28% of their holdings in-kind, while ETH creditors will receive 65.87% of their ETH holdings. On the other hand, creditors of other altcoins, excluding Solana (SOL), will receive an average of 87.65% of their holdings, while Solana creditors will receive 29.58% of their holdings.

XRP & Bitcoin Among Coins Observing Positive Sentiment Right Now According to data from the analytics firm Santiment, the top cap cryptocurrencies are mainly observing the investors hold a bullish outlook. The indicator of interest here is the “Weighted Sentiment,” which basically tells us about the net sentiment around an asset that’s currently present on social media platforms. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes Third Retest Of Historical Support, Analyst Sounds Alarm The “weighted” in its name comes from the fact that it weighs the sentiment present in the market (the Sentiment Balance) against the amount of discussion that’s happening on social media (the Social Volume). Because of this feature, this indicator’s value only registers a spike when not only is the crowd tending heavily towards one side as determined by Santiment’s machine-learning model, but also a large amount of posts/threads/messages exist on social media expressing such sentiment. The advantage of this adjustment is that the indicator is better able to portray what the actual situation in the market is like, as it doesn’t go by the opinion of only a few users (as would be the case in periods where traffic is low). Naturally, positive spikes in the Weighted Sentiment imply investors are bullish right now, while negative ones imply a bearish market. Values around zero suggest either there aren’t enough discussions happening on social media or the users as a whole are simply neutral. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in this indicator for the five top assets in the sector, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), BNB (BNB), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL), over the past few months: As displayed in the above graph, Bitcoin, XRP, Solana, and Ethereum, all have seen the Weighted Sentiment spike into positive territory recently, and these levels have so far persisted into the latest market downturn. This would imply that social media users hold a bullish sentiment around these coins right now. Bitcoin and XRP particularly stand out in terms of this, as the indicator for them is at the highest levels in 17 months and 14 months, respectively. Related Reading: Ethereum Seeing High Exchange Outflows, But Watch Out For This Bearish Signal BNB is the only cryptocurrency out of these that has the Weighted Sentiment in the negative territory, although the investors currently only hold a slightly fearful sentiment. This negative sentiment may actually play into the favor of BNB, however, as markets have historically been more probable to move in the opposite direction to what the crowd is expecting. Naturally, this means that the highly positive sentiment around Bitcoin and XRP could be bearish for their prices instead. XRP Price XRP has extended its drawdown during the past 24 hours with a drop of 6%, which has taken its price to $0.57.

31878229,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632917,1722666612,Solana Price Crashes Below $160 Amid Revelations Of FTX’s Hidden SOL Stash,"The Solana price has been rocked by the latest bombshell revelations surrounding the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. According to a whistleblower claiming inside knowledge of FTX’s operations, the now-bankrupt company is secretly holding a massive stash of Solana tokens – up to 8% of the entire SOL supply. Triggering Fears Of Massive Sell-Off By the numbers, if these allegations are true, this would equate to approximately 46.5 million SOL tokens worth about $7 billion at the current market price, which is $155 at the time of this writing. Related Reading: Cardano Goes Toe-To-Toe With Ethereum As Whales Scoop Up 120 Million ADA “I’m not saying Solana will go to zero, but if this news is true and FTX starts to sell the tokens in the open market, then it could dump the price of Solana significantly,” warned a crypto user who spread the news on social media site X, known only as Wise Advice. In the wake of the news, Solana’s price plummeted below the critical $160 support level, dropping over 9% in the past two weeks and nearly 4% in the past 24 hours as rumors of FTX’s secret SOL holdings circulated. Solana Price Risks Freefall The revelations come on the heels of the FTX estate’s previous sell-off of discounted SOL tokens to repay creditors affected by the exchange’s collapse. Just two months ago, Bitcoinist reported that the estate offloaded a $2.6 billion trove of SOL at around $102 per token. Venture capital firms like Pantera Capital and Figure Markets scooped up large portions of this discounted SOL allocation. It is worth noting that these tokens remain subject to a multi-year vesting period, limiting their immediate impact on Solana’s market dynamics. On the other hand, the alleged hidden FTX stash, if true, could overshadow the impact of these sales and pose a formidable challenge to the Solana price in the near term. Related Reading: Bitcoin Down But Not Out: BTC To $700,000 Highly Probable Says Analyst With the potential for over $7 billion in Solana tokens to eventually hit the market, the cryptocurrency’s price may face intense selling pressure that could undermine its bullish prospects. Still, it is imperative to note that these are only rumors and have not been confirmed by the exchange’s bankruptcy state, and that no further information has been released on the matter, including whether the state overseeing the exchange’s repayment operations plans to sell these tokens to repay creditors, if true. Potential $140s Plunge In terms of immediate price action, crypto analyst Pratty Crypto has highlighted several technical factors that could signal further downside continuation for the cryptocurrency in the coming days. Pratty Crypto contends that Solana is facing a “lot of confluence” that points to a potential move towards the $140 zone.

31874658,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=632909,1722661257,Will August Again Be A Drag For Bitcoin? Here’s What Historical Data Says,"In the Bitcoin and the overall crypto market, August has long been observed as a quieter month, with historical data showing a consistent downturn in both activity and asset value during this time of the year. Coinbase’s analysis further highlights this pattern in its latest weekly report. According to Coinbase analysts David Duong and David Han, there is a noticeable reduction in trading volumes and a decrease in the market’s dynamism that characterizes the month. An Impending Major Dip For Bitcoin In August? The analysts point out that this seasonal trend can’t be seen as a mere coincidence as it is a recurrent phenomenon. In the “Coinbase Weekly” report, they cited that Bitcoin spot volumes in August 2023 fell by 19% compared to June of the same year. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Price Potential: Analyst Maps Path To $700,000 And Beyond Similarly, Bitcoin futures volumes dipped by 30% across global centralized exchanges during the same timeframe. This decreased activity is significant enough to influence market behavior, potentially leading to increased volatility due to thinner liquidity. The Coinbase’s report further details that on average, Bitcoin has shown a decline of 2.8% in August over the last five years. According to the analysts, this trend is not isolated to Bitcoin; it reflects a broader market behaviour that could be attributed to various factors, including seasonal investment shifts and lower participation rates during the summer months in many regions. They further predicted that this August may not stray from the established pattern, expecting a continuation of subdued market performance. Outlook From Analysts In The Community Echoing the sentiment from Coinbase, other prominent figures in the crypto space have shared their observations. Analyst Jelle pointed out on Elon Musk’s social platform X that despite a positive close in July, the historical struggle of the market in Q3 is quite noteworthy, with recovery often not beginning until October. Similarly, analyst Micheal Van De Poppe suggested that while August and September typically record poorer performance, there might be a shift in momentum starting mid-August, potentially setting the stage for new all-time highs in the following months. Related Reading: Is A Major Bitcoin Dip Coming? What the Coinbase Index Tells Us Van De Poppe also disclosed that to see Bitcoin’s continuation towards its all-time high (ATH), price would need to hold above $60,000 to 61,000 region. Meanwhile, at the time of writing, Bitcoin has seen a slight uptick increasing by 0.7% while still trading above $63,000. Commenting on BTC’s current price action, Jelle noted: Bitcoin is still trading inside the channel we’ve spent the past months inside of, but holding above key supports. Looks like a breakout is getting closer by the day. Patience, until then.

Interestingly, this is the first time a major Wall Street bank has given its wealth management division the green light to promote crypto-based investment products. Bitcoin ETF Exposure For High-Net-Worth Investors According to a CNBC report, sources familiar with the policy change said that Morgan Stanley will allow its advisors to urge clients to buy shares of two specific Bitcoin ETFs – BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). The new offering will reportedly go live on Wednesday, August 7. Related Reading: PEPE Bullish Trend Line Under Threat: $0.00000766 Level On Sight? Morgan Stanley’s decision reflects growing investor demand for exposure to the cryptocurrency market. The firm noted that the move is a response to its clients’ appetite, as well as an effort to stay ahead of the booming digital asset landscape. However, Morgan Stanley is taking a cautious approach with its Bitcoin ETF rollout. The bank is restricting eligibility to clients with a net worth of at least $1.5 million, an “aggressive” risk tolerance, and the desire to make speculative investments. Additionally, CNBC reported that Bitcoin exchange-traded funds will only be available in taxable brokerage accounts, not retirement accounts. The bank will also closely monitor clients’ overall crypto holdings to ensure they do not become overly exposed to the highly volatile asset class. Currently, the only crypto investments approved for purchase at Morgan Stanley are the two Bitcoin ETFs and private funds from Galaxy and FS NYDIG, which were made available starting in 2021. BTC Trading Volumes Spike 25% According to data from SoSo Value, the total net inflow for Bitcoin spot ETFs on Thursday reached $50.64 million. This was driven by a significant $191 million net inflow into the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust mini ETF, as well as a $25.9 million net inflow into BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s primary ETF (GBTC) saw a net outflow of $71.3 million on the same day.

Trading Guru Weighs In On The Historic Financial Duel,"In the digital asset world, the only valid rival for Bitcoin asides Ethereum is often regarded as Gold. So far, many analysts and experts have continued to make comparisons between these two assets especially to see what price Bitcoin could trade at if it had the same market cap as Gold. Speaking on a similar topic, Peter Brandt, a trading guru with decades of experience in the trading space has recently shared insights, focusing his analysis on the ongoing rivalry between Bitcoin and gold, positioning them as contenders for the coveted title of the “ultimate Store-of-Value.” Notably, the insights shared by Brandt wasn’t just about market cap or investor preference; it particularly delved into the core functionalities and inherent values of each asset. Bitcoin Vs. Gold Delving into the insight, it is worth understanding the nuances of BTC comparison to gold—a “classic safe-haven asset.” Brandt’s recent examination of the Bitcoin-to-gold ratio provides a critical metric for this comparison. He highlighted that the current ratio stands at 26, suggesting that Bitcoin, despite its volatility, maintains a strong position against gold. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Poised for a September Price Surge? What Traders Need to Know This ratio, Brandt points out, could fluctuate significantly, potentially decreasing to as low as 16 in response to market movements without undermining Bitcoin’s long-term potential to ascend much higher. Peter Brandt’s analysis goes beyond mere speculation. He emphasizes the importance of flexibility in investment strategies, particularly when dealing with assets as volatile as Bitcoin and as stable as gold. The “Store-of-Value” battle is historic The BTC/Gold chart is a textbook example of classical charting principles Flexibility of interpretation is more important than is dogmatism Currently at 26.x, $BTC could (could, not will) drop significantly vs Gold to as low as 16 without… pic.twitter.com/gduy0fTRtE — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) August 1, 2024 According to Brandt, the key takeaway from his analysis is the potential for the BTC/gold ratio to experience significant shifts. For instance, although the ratio might see a short-term decrease, Brandt’s long-term view suggests it could soar to 150 or more. This perspective is not just about championing Bitcoin but about advocating for a balanced investment approach. Brandt advises investors to hold both Bitcoin and gold, highlighting the benefits of diversification. By investing in both, traders can mitigate the risks associated with the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the often slower-moving gold market. Brandt noted: I believe in owning both Gold and Bitcoin To be dogmatic on either one is equal to FOOL’S Gold BTC And Gold Market Performance Meanwhile, in the past week, Bitcoin has been on a bearish ride, down by 7.1% in the past 24 hours and roughly 14.8% from its peak above $73,000 in March.

Bitcoin Risks Crash To $42,000 On August 1, the pseudonymous crypto analyst DonAlt shared an in-depth price analysis and future outlook of Bitcoin on the TechnicalRoundup YouTube channel. According to the analyst Bitcoin could experience a potential price crash to $42,000 if it fails to hold the critical support level at $63,000. Related Reading: XRP Price Breaks Out Of 6-Year Triangle, But Is A Rally To $1 Possible? Based on Bitcoin’s recent price actions and present market conditions, the cryptocurrency is seen to be facing a crucial support level at the $63,000 price mark. According to DonAlt, Bitcoin previously reclaimed the $60,000 level, after experiencing a period of volatility and consistent declines. The crypto analyst revealed that the $60,000 price mark was seen as a bullish sign, possibly hinting at further upsides. However, despite the price leap, Bitcoin is now facing a rejection and has been unable to continue its expected upward momentum. During his analysis, DonAlt indicated that if Bitcoin’s price successfully stays above the $63,000 critical support level, a future bullish scenario remains valid. On the other hand, if the cryptocurrency falls below this key level, its price outlook potentially becomes much more concerning and bearish. DonAlt foresees Bitcoin crashing around $52,000 and $42,000 if it cannot maintain its price near the $63,000 mark. He further indicated that the cryptocurrency might test these lower price levels as potential new support zones. Looking ahead, the crypto analyst has stressed the importance of watching Bitcoin’s behavior and market movements at the $63,000 price mark, underscoring the significance of this critical support level to avoid further downward pressure for the cryptocurrency. Based on CoinMarketCap’s reports, Bitcoin’s price is trading significantly above the $63,000 support level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is trading at $64,104. Despite declining by 4.44% over the past week, the cryptocurrency remains on an upward trajectory, steadily approaching the $70,000 threshold. BTC Bulls Take A Hit As Bearish Sentiment Rise Popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) post on August 1, that numerous investors who had bet big on Bitcoin’s price surge had experienced substantial losses during the recent downturn. According to data from Coinglass, over $2.5 billion in leveraged long positions were liquidated when Bitcoin fell below the $63,000 mark. Related Reading: Market Experts Update Ethereum Predictions: Is A 1,400% Rally To $50,000 Possible? Martinez revealed that investors who are presently betting on Bitcoin’s potential to decline are becoming overconfident.
