15156149,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543769,1689976807,Dogecoin Becomes 8th-Largest Cryptocurrency After Adding $1 Billion To Market Cap,"Dogecoin continues to cement itself as the largest meme coin by market cap, displaying signs of renewed enthusiasm every so often. This week, the meme-inspired cryptocurrency added over $1 billion to its market cap, making it the 8th-largest crypto. This was a result of Dogecoin’s surge of over 10%, boosting its market cap to more than $10 billion in a matter of hours. Dogecoin Pushes Solana To Number 9 Dogecoin has come a long way since its creation as a joke. Fueled by the hype on social media, the meme cryptocurrency has skyrocketed up the rankings to become the 8th-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The price of Dogecoin recently crossed over the $0.070 resistance level to reach $0.076. As a result, more than $1 billion was added to its market cap, surging from $9.67 billion to $10.66 billion. Related Reading: Coinbase Exchange Tells Borrowers That They Have Four Months To Pay Back Although its price has now dropped to $0.074 at the time of writing, Dogecoin still has a $10.35 billion market cap, pushing Solana down to the number 9 spot. On the other hand, Solana is down by 7% in a 7-day timeframe and has lost more than $1.4 billion in market cap. What’s Pushing The Price? A big part of Dogecoin’s past success has come mostly from social media hype and a few influential people and groups hyping it up. A major influence is billionaire Elon Musk. Ever since Musk began tweeting about the meme coin, Dogecoin has gained more attention from crypto investors and his tweets praising the crypto have led to major spikes in interest and price. DOGE price retraces to $0.73 following 10% surge | Source: DOGEUSD on Tradingview.com The latest spike in the price of Dogecoin seems to have come from rumors of Tesla retaining the cryptocurrency in its payment page source code. Dogecoin is the second cryptocurrency to be accepted by the automobile manufacturer after Tesla added Bitcoin as an option back in 2021. However, Tesla has since discontinued the option to pay with Bitcoin and has deleted the option in the source code of its payment page. At present, Tesla has deleted “bitcoin” in the source code of its payment page, but still retains “dogecoin”. pic.twitter.com/BQrRtuTN8Z — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) July 21, 2023 DOGE Price Prediction Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.07378, ranging between $0.065 and $0.075 for the past week. If the $0.075 resistance is broken through, we could see DOGE rise to as high as its February price of $0.096. Interestingly, the asset has bounced off the $0.060 support level multiple times since August 2022, making it a significant support for the meme coin. So a break below $0.060 could see DOGE fall to its lowest point in over a year. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue While Dogecoin lacks the scarcity of Bitcoin or the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum, it’s won over an enthusiastic community of supporters and has become relatively stable over the years. However, Dogecoin is still a very volatile investment, and its value is largely based on social media hype rather than real-world utility.

42392995,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEWDZ,1689976000,"Bitcoin Dawdles Below $30K as Investors Eye Coming Fed Rate Decision, BTC Options Expiry","In another day of crypto market drudgery, bitcoin (BTC) briefly feinted higher Friday before settling back into its increasingly familiar environs below $30,000. The largest digital asset by market capitalization was recently trading at $29,904, up 0.3%.  Ether (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency, remained largely unfazed during the day, lingering at around its weekly low below $1,900. Major alternative cryptocurrencies – so-called altcoins – including SOL and XRP recovered some of their losses endured earlier in the day.  MKR, governance token of decentralized finance lender MakerDAO, defied the broader market and enjoyed double-digit gains, buoyed by the activation of a token buyback program.  But micro-cap token CNC cratered as much as 75% during the day following a 1,700 ETH – some $3.2 million – exploit of Conic Finance, a Curve-adjacent decentralized finance protocol.  The CoinDesk Market Index, which tracks the performance of a basket of digital assets, inched up 0.3% in the last 24 hours, underscoring a somewhat tepid trading day. Investors will be eyeing a likely Federal Reserve interest rate increase and bitcoin options expiry next week.  Read more: Bitcoin, Ether Headed Toward Losing Months in Usually Upbeat July  In an email, Rachel Lin, CEO and co-founder of decentralized derivatives exchange SynFutures noted that the week started with enthusiasm over a favorable ruling in the Ripple-SEC case as investors expressed hopes for an altcoin season. But BTC and ETH failed to break resistance and returned to their weekly range lows, weighing on the market.  “[Bitcoin] options data reveal high open interest in $31,000 and $32,000 Call Options, denoting strong resistance at these levels,” Lin said. “The past day has been more favorable, with call options trading nearly 3x the volume of put options.”  “Fundamentally, the outlook remains bullish as money continues to flow into the crypto ecosystem,” she added. “This could represent a brief reversal, potentially leading to a move up to $34,000 if BTC achieves a sustained breakout above $31,500.”  Priced-In Spot BTC ETF  In an interview with CoinDesk TV's ""First Mover"" program, Will Peck, head of digital assets for asset manager WisdomTree, said that it was ""tough"" to pinpoint a near-term bitcoin price target. But he also suggested that the impact of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a spot bitcoin ETF from any of the financial services giants that filed applications last month, including WisdomTree, was uncertain.  ""An underlying question is how much institutional money there might be out there,"" Peck said.  Lawrence Lewitinn, head of content at The Tie and CoinDesk TV contributor, said that neither the U.S. central bank's likely 25 basis point rate (bps) on Wednesday nor the end-of-month options expiry would likely stir bitcoin from its current lull.  ""We'll see for the most part prices stay flat, at least for the upcoming,"" Lewitinn said. ""Unless there's some exogenous variable, some sort of crazy news story – who knows what [SEC Chair Gary] Gensler could do. But all things being equal, we're probably going to end up at about $30,000, a slow week.""",NEUTRAL,BTC | ETH,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | MARKET | TRADING,"Krisztian Sandor, James Rubin",0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/bitcoin-dawdles-below-30k-as-investors-eye-coming-fed-rate-decision-btc-options-expiry,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/3e1ad0fe3944245d2cf35866717c120fcaf75d8d-1684x1026.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

XRP Price Boom after Ripple’s Partial Win Against SEC Last week, XRP experienced an incredible price surge, growing by over 100% in value in just one day. The rise was a direct consequence of Ripple's partial win in a long battle against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC). SEC first sued Ripple for its supposed breach of the U.S. Securities laws back in 2020 which started the 3-year-long crusade. Finally, on July 13, 2023, judge Analisa Torres of District Court of the Southern District of New York pronounced in her ruling that XRP does not qualify as a security, at least regarding programmatic sales and “other distributions” (it is considered a security in regard to institutional sales).

Heather Morgan, who used the hip-hop alias “Razzlekhan” to push her music online, and her husband Ilya Lichtenstein were arrested earlier this year and are set to appear for a plea hearing on August 3 before Senior Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington. Laundered Bitcoin Exceeds $4.5 Billion Ilya Lichtenstein and Heather Morgan, both residents of New York, are facing charges for allegedly conspiring to launder the proceeds of 119,754 Bitcoin (BTC) that were stolen from Bitfinex in 2016. After the hacker breached the platform’s systems and initiated over 2,000 unauthorized transactions, the stolen Bitcoin was transferred to a digital wallet controlled by Lichtenstein. Over five years, approximately 25,000 of those stolen Bitcoin were moved out of Lichtenstein’s wallet via a complex money-laundering process, which ultimately resulted in some of the stolen funds being deposited into financial accounts controlled by the couple. Related Reading: Riding The Ripple Effect: What’s Next For Stellar Lumens (XLM)? More than 94,000 Bitcoin, the remainder of the stolen funds, were left in the wallet used to receive and store the illegal proceeds from the hack. However, after executing court-authorized search warrants for online accounts controlled by Lichtenstein and Morgan, special agents accessed files in an online account controlled by Lichtenstein. These files contained the private keys required to access the digital wallet that directly received the funds stolen from Bitfinex, enabling law enforcement to lawfully seize and recover over 94,000 Bitcoin, valued at over $3.6 billion at the time of seizure. According to the criminal complaint, Lichtenstein and Morgan used various sophisticated laundering techniques, including setting up online accounts using fictitious identities, automating transactions using computer programs, depositing the stolen funds into accounts at virtual currency exchanges and darknet markets, converting Bitcoin to other forms of virtual currency, and using U.S.-based business accounts to legitimize their banking activity. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue While Bitcoin was worth $71 million at the time of the hack, it had appreciated to over $4.5 billion at the time of their arrest earlier this year. Prosecutors are now seeking to have the pair forfeit assets worth around $3 billion, including cash from bank accounts and tokens from crypto wallets. Additionally, prosecutors are seeking to have the couple forfeit gold coins that were “excavated and recovered by law enforcement” from an undisclosed location in California. At present, Bitcoin remains the largest cryptocurrency in the market, based on trading volume and capitalization. It is currently trading at $29,860, which is relatively stable compared to the previous 24 hours, with a slight increase of 0.5%.

Burn Kenny, the new hilariously irreverent meme coin has raised over $400,000 in market cap on its presale, leaving fans excited for what’s to come. Inspired by the beloved South Park character, Burn Kenny is a super deflationary token that’s designed to do one thing – get burnt. How Burn Kenny’s Meme Coin Token Burning Could Benefit Investors Burn Kenny’s token burning process is designed to gradually decrease the total supply of the token, creating scarcity and potentially increasing the value of the remaining tokens. The process works by gradually burning a portion of the total token supply over a set period until a predetermined percentage of the tokens have been destroyed. In Burn Kenny’s case, 30% of the total token supply will be burnt over three days, starting 24 hours after the token’s initial listing. This will be done by sending a portion of the tokens straight to the “fiery depths of token hell,” effectively removing them from circulation. The burning process will continue at a rate of 10% every 24 hours until the 30% burn target is reached. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue The value of the remaining tokens could potentially increase as a result of the token-burning process, as there will be fewer tokens in circulation. This creates a situation of increased demand for the remaining tokens, which could drive up their price. With a total token supply of 6,666,666,666, an arbitrary number Burn Kenny’s tokenomics are as unique as the character himself. The presale accounts for 40% of the total token supply, while another 30% will be thrown into the Uniswap liquidity pool, locked for three months. The remaining 30% will be sent straight to the fiery depths of token hell, gradually burnt over three days, starting 24 hours after listing. By the end of Q3 2023, the team behind Burn Kenny aims to have fulfilled all their roadmap goals. In recent updates, they have announced that they have deployed the contract, paired and locked Liquidity Pool (LP), and updated DexTools with hot pairs ready for trading. These preparations are all essential steps in ensuring a smooth and successful launch for Burn Kenny. Deploying the contract and pairing and locking LP are key technical components of the launch process. The contract deployment involves setting up the smart contract that will govern the token and ensure its functionality. In addition to these technical preparations, the Burn Kenny team has also been working to build hype and generate excitement for the launch. They have noted that Ethereum is trending and that DexTools is ready for hot pairs, which could help to drive interest and increase demand for the token. Related Reading: New Crypto Bill Demands SEC And CFTC To Draft Rules For Trading Platforms Burn Kenny’s irreverent approach to cryptocurrency and its use of the South Park character Kenny McCormick as its mascot give it a distinct personality and make it stand out from other meme coins. Of course, like any meme coin, Burn Kenny’s success will ultimately depend on the strength of its community and the demand for its tokens. However, its unique concept and approach to the meme coin genre could potentially make it a standout project in the crowded world of cryptocurrency.

During his presentation at the Ethereum Community Conference (EthCC) in Paris, Buterin unveiled plans for introducing account abstraction to Ethereum. He described the proposed upgrade as ""super elegant"" due to its implementation not necessitating modifications to Ethereum's underlying protocol, unlike prior upgrades. Smart Contracts, Smarter Protocols Account abstraction envisages transitioning externally owned wallets to smart contract-based wallets, enhancing users' control over their private key seed phrase, akin to resetting an email password. This could also translate into lower transaction fees through ""signless transactions."" Buterin elaborated on the potential benefits: ""The idea here is if there are these techniques that allow you to take mold many signatures from any transactions, combine them into one object which is much smaller and which can be much more quickly verified than verifying all of the account abstraction transactions individually and by doing so you can save data [and] computation becomes 100 times cheaper."" The smart contract wallet upgrade would further enable Ethereum users to receive various cryptocurrencies and pay network fees without conversion to Ethereum. However, the announcement comes with an acknowledgment of the challenges that lie ahead. Account abstraction, expected to attract a billion users to Ethereum, is not without its hurdles. In his discussion, Buterin acknowledged that upgrading existing Ethereum externally-owned accounts into smart contracts and ensuring the protocol works similarly in layer-2 solutions would be significant challenges. Additional difficulties include integrating with existing technologies such as biometrics and wallets. Despite these hurdles, Buterin expressed enthusiasm for the project's progress. The introduction of account abstraction could revolutionize the Ethereum experience, allowing users and decentralized applications (DApps) to sponsor transactions more efficiently. It could also enable more economical data use and faster verification times. The news comes at a time when the crypto market, including Bitcoin and Ripple's XRP, is experiencing a resurgence, highlighting the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of this space. Account Abstraction And The Future of Ethereum While the implementation of account abstraction is heralded as a technical breakthrough, the intricate process of this upgrade warrants careful exploration. On a practical level, account abstraction means the transformation of externally owned wallets to those driven by smart contracts. This transition could simplify the recovery of private key seed phrases, lower transaction fees, and even enable Ethereum users to accept multiple types of cryptocurrencies without the necessity for conversions. This means that it could become 100 times cheaper in terms of data savings and computational costs. “This is actually especially a big deal on rollups because in a rollup a big or on because a big part of the size of a transaction is the signature on a rollup,"" Buterin said. Despite this, however, as Buterin notes quite sharply, navigating this transition won't go forth without its requisite challenges. Key upgrades to the Ethereum ecosystem, such as transitioning existing externally-owned accounts into smart contracts, and ensuring the protocol's compatibility with layer-2 solutions are hurdles that must be surmounted. The integration of this new system with existing technoliogies, like biometrics and present-day wallets, presents further complexities. Yet, the air of optimism surrounding account abstraction is tangible. Buterin's enthusiasm signals that despite the challenges, the potential rewards could be transformative, propelling Ethereum to new heights of user accessibility and network efficiency. As Ethereum prepares for this innovative leap, the industry watches in anticipation, ready for the potential advent of an even more dynamic era in the Ethereum saga.

On Feb 8. 2023, a UK Court dismissed Wright's plea that he should be able to block the operation of Bitcoin and the system that forked from it, Bitcoin Cash, because they breach his intellectual property rights. Wright's claim was made against a host of defendants (26 in total) associated with Bitcoin, including developers and several entities of crypto exchange Coinbase. Wright claims the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision blockchain he created from another Bitcoin fork is the authentic blockchain behind the bitcoin cryptocurrency.  ""This ruling means the judges only agreed that Dr. Wright should be allowed to argue that the Bitcoin file format is sufficiently well-defined to receive copyright protection under UK law,"" said a statement from the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund, a nonprofit set up by former Twitter chief Jack Dorsey to assist developers facing lawsuits, including 13 in this case. ""The decision does not address the question of whether the Bitcoin file format should receive copyright protection and whether that copyright belongs to Dr. Wright.""  Whether Wright is indeed Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto will be determined at a trial slated to begin in January 2024. In a case heard in Oslo last year, multiple witnesses offered forensic evidence that documents supplied by Wright purporting to back up his claim to be Nakomoto contain discrepancies, such as fonts that weren’t available at the time.  The issues about copyright protection ""will be decided at a full trial, but only if Dr. Wright first demonstrates that he is Satoshi Nakamoto in a trial of only that issue in early 2024,"" the Bitcoin Legal Defense Fund statement said. The Defense Fund also cautioned that ""the fact that the UK courts are allowing his arguments ... sets a dangerous precedent where developers can be sued for violating the file format of open source software that someone else claims to have created.""  Lawyers for Wright said he was ""pleased"" with the outcome, and acknowledged the high stakes of the case.  ""This significant ruling ... enables Dr. Wright to advance his claim for copyright in the Bitcoin File Format which potentially affects all future use, and marketing, of Bitcoin and will prove to be a crucial development in intellectual property law,” Damon Parker, a partner at U.K. law firm Harcus Parker, said in a statement.

15151197,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543760,1689965597,"We gave ChatGPT $20,000 to invest and this is how it spent it","2023 has seen the rise of AI, with programs such as Bard and ChatGPT offering answers to any and all queries, ranging from what the weather is to writing college essays. We all know AI is based on machine learning, but how much can we trust the advice it gives? We wanted to find out if we can trust these programs, so we gave ChatGPT a budget of $10k to invest in stocks and $10k to invest in cryptocurrencies, subsequently following the advice provided. Before following this advice, it is worth noting ChatGPT states the information given is not financial advice, and consulting with a financial advisor is always recommended. ChatGPT also suggests doing your own research to make more informed decisions regarding which stocks are worth investing in. The program provides further advice for cryptocurrencies, stressing the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the importance of considering your financial situation when making investment decisions. Regularly reviewing your portfolio based on market conditions and investment performance is also advised. The Breakdown It took a little bit of training, but we eventually got ChatGPT to suggest exactly how much of my budget to invest in each stock/ coin, the breakdown is as follows: Stock Percentage Total Invested Apple Inc 10% $1000 Amazon.com Inc 10% $1000 Microsoft Corporation 9% $900 Alphabet Inc 9% $900 NVIDIA Corporation 8% $800 Tesla Inc 7% $700 NextEra Energy, Inc 7% $700 Amgen Inc 4% $400 Johnson & Johnson 4% $400 Moderna, Inc 4% $400 Pfizer Inc 4% $400 Gilead Sciences, Inc 3% $300 PayPal Holdings Inc 3% $300 General Motors Company 3% $300 NIO Inc 3% $300 First Solar, Inc 2% $200 Enphase Energy, Inc 2% $200 Shopify Inc 2% $200 Vestas Wind Systems A/S 2% $200 MercadoLibre, Inc 1% $100 Johnson Controls International plc 1% $100 Square, Inc 1% $100 Rivian 1% $100 Coin Percentage Total Invested Bitcoin 20% $2000 Ethereum 20% $2000 Binance Coin 10% $1000 Litecoin 10% $1000 Solana 10% $1000 Polkadot 10% $1000 Ripple 10% $1000 Cardano 10% $1000 The suggested stocks are rather expected; higher investments in stable stocks and a lower investment into stocks with more fluctuations. The cryptocurrency investments are slightly more interesting, however, as, of the 1000+ coins currently on the market, it’s given me a short list of eight to invest in. The Experiment The first week The experiment started off on unsteady legs with stocks ending with a profit of $159 and cryptocurrencies making a loss of $64 after the first day. Five of the eight cryptocurrencies invested in made a loss, with Binance Coin performing the worst, with our $956 investment suffering a $44 decrease. Stocks increased throughout the week but decreased right at the end ($25 lower compared to the previous day), making the final weekly total $10,220. This is a $220 increase from the initial investment, a solid start for our experiment. Our crypto investment did not perform nearly as well in the first week, with only three days ending in a profit from the initial $10k investment. The fourth day was the worst of our whole experiment, with an ending total of $9,741. Only two of the coins invested turned a profit on that day, with Ethereum making a loss of $114 from the initial investment. Our week ended on a slightly more positive note with a final total of $10,021, a $21 increase from the initial investment. The second week During the second week, the total reached $10,643 by the end of the second day. This is $423 more than the total at the end of week one. However, this high was short-lived as the final value decreased for the remainder of the week, ending on $10,492. Whilst $272 more than the final value of the first week, it’s $151 less than the second day’s total. After a shaky beginning, our cryptocurrency investment far outperformed our stocks investment in the second week, peaking at $11,118 on the fourth day. This then decreased on the fifth and final day, making the final value of the week $10,987, a $967 increase from the first week. The third week The start of the third week saw more decreases for our stocks investments. Nine of our 23 investments decreased on the second and third day. The latter half of the week performed better, increasing to $10,559 in total by the final day. Our cryptocurrency investment performed similarly, with a decrease at the start of the week and an increase towards the end. The final value dropped to $10,609 on the fourth day, then increased dramatically to $10,974 by the end of the fifth. The final value of the week was $11,402, a $415 increase from week two. The final week The final week of our stock investments was a disappointment with the overall value decreasing slightly for a final figure of $10,587. This is an overall increase of $587 from our initial investment, which is an overall ROI of 6%. On the first day of the final week, our crypto investments increased by $314 to $11,719 in total, this is the highest end of day total we reached in our experiment. This was the high point, however, as we decreased throughout the rest of the week, ending with a final total of $11,359, a 14% ROI. Overall Performance Stocks Whilst we ended up turning a profit from our stock investments, there were ten investments which made a loss from the initial investment, almost 45% of investments made. The worst-performing stock was Pfizer inc. which decreased from the third week and ended up with an ROI of -10%. This was after the company announced they were discontinuing the development of the type 2 diabetes and obesity candidate lotiglipron over safety concerns. Rivian proved the best-performing stock, with an ROI of 88%, initially priced at $14.03 per stock it increased to $25.51 over the month. This is after the company announced that Q2 2023 was the best financial quarter in the company’s history. Cryptocurrency On the other hand, we had much more luck with our crypto investments, with only one of the investments returning a loss, making up 13% of the initial investment. This was Ripple (XRP), there are several reasons for this, one being that the transaction volume of XRP is down 90%. The coin with the highest ROI is Solana (SOL) with an ROI of 39%, which is a $389 increase. SOL is considered a relatively stable coin with strong community backing, making it a good coin to invest in. Hits or Misses? Whilst it’s possible Bitcoin was suggested as one of the largest investments because it’s the biggest cryptocurrency. It was actually a great crypto to invest in as the price went from $26k to $30k, this was due to news that a new, safer, crypto exchange launched, receiving investments from Invesco and WisdomTree. There is one stock we feel could have been missed from ChatGPT’s suggestions, this is Meta, the company who owns Facebook and Instagram. They’ve recently released a new app as part of Instagram called Threads, a Twitter competitor. It was released at the perfect time, after news that Twitter was limiting the number of Tweets its users could see. This isn’t one of the stocks ChatGPT suggested investing in, so we wanted to see what could have happened had ChatGPT suggested investing in META stocks. Using historical data for the last month, we calculated that if we had invested $1,000, we would have $1,100 by the end of the experiment. This is more than we earned from the $1,000 we invested in Amazon and Apple stocks. Methodology We started by asking ChatGPT for stock market opportunities. Initially, it gave a generic answer of the types of industries which should be invested in and why. From these industries, we asked it to recommend specific companies from each. We then sent the list of all the suggested stocks back to it and asked for a weighting of a $10k investment. We found that one of the stocks suggested, Waymo, is not a publicly traded business, we had to go back to ChatGPT and ask for it to remove this stock and add a new one. It was replaced by Johnson Controls International plc. It was a much easier process to get answers about which cryptocurrencies to invest in. As ChatGPT gave us an initial list of coins, and when asked how much to invest in each it gave a general strategy for investing in cryptocurrency. 40-50% should come from Bitcoin and Ethereum combined and 10-20% for each of the remaining coins. We decided to put 20% into Bitcoin, 20% into Ethereum and 10% for the remaining coins.",NEUTRAL,SOL,BTC | BUSINESS | ETH | EXCHANGE | SOL,,0,0,NewsBTC,https://www.newsbtc.com/research/we-gave-chatgpt-20000-to-invest-and-this-is-how-it-spent-it/,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/15151197.jpeg

There are also 32 active bounties sitting on the marketplace. Seven were posted by Tron DAO, while the remaining majority comes from Arkham Admin, as of 18:18 UTC.  CoinDesk found that the average value of a bounty is 5,931 ARKM (the native token) or $3,677, though more than 72% of the bounties are worth 1,000 ARKM, ranging from identifying the public address of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and attributing addresses that belong to Bitwise, a large crypto asset manager with over $1 billion in assets under management. The two largest bounties, worth about 100,000 ARKM and 50,000 ARKM, respectively, revolve around identifying addresses that exploited FTX during its collapse and hacked crypto trading firm Wintermute.  Meanwhile, another address has a submission for a bounty worth 1,500 ARKM asking for the identification of an address owned by MicroStrategy (MSTR) with over 10,000 BTC volume.  Even though there are a few buyers requesting on-chain intelligence, namely Tron DAO and Arkham Admin, all submissions come from unique addresses. Arkham did not respond to a request for a comment by press time.  The platform recently found itself in the midst of a public-relations firestorm with a vocal contingent of the crypto community expressing outrage on Twitter over its program that incentivizes people to reveal the identities behind otherwise anonymous or pseudonymous blockchain addresses. However, during a Twitter Space, Arkham CEO Miguel Morel batted back at critics, arguing that a lack of privacy is inherent to how most blockchains operate today.

Bitcoin continued a month-long stagnancy, logging a fourth consecutive week of less than 2% in price movement. Directionally, the largest asset by market capitalization closed the week down 1.3%, after rising 0.3% the week prior. With 10 days remaining in July, Bitcoin is poised to log its second losing month of 2023.  Ether followed a similar trajectory though its trading range has been wider with this week’s 1.63% decline following f a 3.24% increase last week. Ether has yet to log a losing month this year, but will need to surpass $1,934 over the next 10 days to maintain its winning streak. ETH was recently changing hands at $1,897, up 0.2%.

BTC and ETH’s seven-day performance ranked them 26th and 29th in a list of cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of $1 billion or more.

Overall Currency and DeFi sector performance within the CMI universe was muted this week, with DeFi finishing up 1.3% and the currency sector falling 0.5%.

42392992,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEVt3,1689963341,DeFi Project Parrot Holds Contentious Vote on Future of $70M Treasury,"Parrot Finance raised over $80 million in a public token sale during Solana's heyday. Two years later – its plans for shaking up crypto lending markets long since fizzled – the protocol is holding a vote to buy its investors out.  The new proposal calls for an end to Parrot's so-called governance token through a redemption program that divides $50 million of its treasury amongst PRT owners, would be worth $0.0045 apiece.  Such a price would obliterate the earliest investors in Parrot's vision of building a powerful stablecoin and lending markets for the Solana blockchain. IDO investors stand to recoup one tenth of their initial investment, despite Parrot's treasury retaining $73 million, only 12% less than what they put in.  But Parrot's team, which never followed through on its promise to give PRT owners power over the protocol, and which has faced accusations of being absent from the protocol's drivers' seat, could walk away with tens of millions of dollars, according to investors angered by the plan.  The situation highlights the downside of funding crypto protocols through unregulated token offerings at a time of heightened action by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Parrot's promoters promised its community a protocol they would govern; instead, they're being asked to leave with pennies on the dollar.  PRT redemption tokenomics  Two years after its roll out, however, Parrot’s plans haven’t panned out. Its total value locked (TVL) places it in the lower tier of Solana DeFi and its token is well below sale price. Even as other protocols rally with user incentive mechanisms and liquid staking token integrations, Parrot’s TVL has gone sideways.  Parrot.fi raised $84.7 million when it sold 10% of all PRT tokens to the public in September and October 2021, at the height of that year’s bull run for Solana DeFi. Those tokens have since lost at least 88% of their value, according to Cryptorank. Meanwhile, the project’s treasury remains in the tens of millions.  Parrot's redemption plan would return about $50 million of Parrot's nearly $73 million treasury to holders of PRT, according to investor estimates. The remaining $21 million would stay with insiders: $6.3 million for seven years of project ""runway,"" $8.3 million in illiquid LP tokens and up to $10 million in private investments the team made under dubious circumstances.  Those figures have irked the investors who rallied for a buyback. But Parrot's redemption plan also lacks restrictions on who can participate, meaning insiders might take from the redeemable treasury as well.  Investors say the deck stacked further in Parrot team's favor last November, when they unilaterally unlocked a major tranche of unvested team and VC tokens two years ahead of schedule. This move now gives the insiders strong influence over Parrot's redemption vote and, according to the investors, a better effective redemption price.  Parrot team members did not respond to a request for comment.  The DAO that never was  Like many DeFi protocols that fly under the banner of democratizing finance, Parrot launched with intentions to one day be ruled by its community, according to statements leader PartyParrot made in June 2021.  One popular way to accomplish this feat is by giving token holders a voting say in the protocol's operations through a DAO. Indeed, Parrot sold over $80 million of its PRT ""governance token"" to the public in late 2021. But Parrot never set up a DAO through which PRT owners could vote on anything. Instead, the team executed major decisions, from changing tokenomics to ""trust me bro"" investments, without holding a formal vote.  The current vote marks Parrot's first-ever foray into token-based governance. If it passes it will mark the end of the PRT token and nullify the promise of community control.  “The first proposal of DAO is to kill the Parrot 🤣 Hilarious,” the pseudonymous user Parachute, who has been in Parrot’s Discord server since October 2021, said in a public channel Friday.  At press time the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of conducting a buyback with 97% in favor. The vote is well below quorum; it is open for the next week. Some voters on ballot-casting website Realms blasted the early insider unlock for rendering the team “majority token holders, making this vote meaningless and a total farce.”  Parrot’s community in the Discord appeared split between open anger from long-term holders and begrudging acceptance from newcomers.  The pseudonymous Crypto_Boi, an investor who joined Parrot’s Discord months after its token sale and bought in when PRT was valued at $0.001, called the redemption “nothing short of a robbery” but was nonetheless in favor.  “It’s good that a redemption is happening, Because the team has done nothing of substance for the last year and a half and has been draining the treasury with their salaries,” Crypto_Boi said. “But they provide 0 results. So redemption is the only option.”",NEGATIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | BUSINESS | REGULATION | SOL | TOKEN SALE,Danny Nelson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/defi-project-parrot-puts-fate-of-over-70m-treasury-prt-token-to-vote,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/a016a6ba25261244fedf380f1848a07c8b3508b3-1500x1000.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

15149826,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543732,1689962457,Ethereum Daily Users Plunge Amid Declining Network Revenue,"The second quarter of 2023 brought significant challenges for the Ethereum network as its revenue experienced a sharp decline. Ethereum network revenue plummeted from $1.27 billion to $847 million during Q2, representing a staggering 33.3% drop. The network revenue for Ethereum encompasses all transaction fees paid by users to Ether validators, as well as the portion of charges that are removed from circulation through burning. Given this, the decline in revenue reflects the decrease in overall activity on the platform, especially in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, where developments have been far from welcoming. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro During Q2 2023, the DeFi market faced a lean period, characterized by a lack of significant growth and unfavorable events. Notably, hack incidents in the DeFi sector increased by a staggering 63% during the quarter, resulting in losses of $228 million across 79 hacks. This was confirmed by Arltduv, a Crypto Directory in a Twitter Post on July 20, 2023. These incidents have had a negative impact on user confidence and contributed to the decline in the overall value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols, with Ether-based protocols accounting for more than 90% of the total TVL. Ethereum’s Daily Active Addresses Decline In addition to the revenue decline, Ethereum’s daily active addresses experienced a notable drop of 6% during Q2 2023. The metric measures the number of unique wallet addresses that have conducted transactions on the Ether blockchain per day during the quarter. Despite the ongoing bear market, the decline in daily active addresses hasn’t worsened significantly, indicating a level of resilience in user activity. ETH price resting at $1,891 | Source: ETHUSD on Tradingview.com Ethereum’s performance during the second quarter suggests that while it faced challenges in network revenue and daily user engagement, the platform remains a key player in the DeFi space. The continuous efforts to improve the network’s usability and scalability are crucial in attracting a broader user base, as demonstrated by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s recent proposal. ETH Still King Of DeFi Despite the decline in daily users and network revenue, Ethereum has managed to maintain its spot as the leading blockchain when it comes to DeFi activity. The network currently accounts for more than 50% of Total Value Locked (TVL) across all blockchains, establishing it as the leader in this regard. Related Reading: Ethereum Monthly Burn Surpasses 146,000 ETH As Total Clears $6.5 Billion Layer 2 blockchains such as Arbitrum and Polyon built atop the Ethereum network are also doing incredibly well. Arbitrum is currently sitting at $2.649 billion in TVL, with Polygon trailing behind at $1.044 billion in TVL. In terms of price, ETH is still closely following the performance of Bitcoin. The altcoin is trading at $1,892 at the time of this writing, with meager gains of 0.07% in the last day.

42393009,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEkc1,1689962328,Federal Reserve’s ‘FedNow’ Launch Triggers Fresh Speculation Over Digital Dollar,"The U.S. Federal Reserve denies that its new instant payments service, FedNow, is in any way tied to the digital asset space.  But experts say the new system could lay the groundwork for the infrastructure needed for a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the U.S. And so this week’s announcement has led to a fresh airing of warnings about potential privacy and control risks around a digital dollar.  The Fed on Thursday officially launched the service, which makes the process of sending payments in the U.S. almost instant, as opposed to a few hours or days that sending money from account to account currently takes.  Some crypto enthusiasts saw the release as a form of validation, because the FedNow project adopts a key goal of the digital asset industry:moving money around easily and quickly, and at any time of day or the week, even if banks are closed. FedNow will operate 24 hours a day.  “This is a payment system, not a digital token or a CBDC, but it is something that can be used to facilitate the creation of a CBDC,” said Jim Bianco, president of Bianco Research.  But the FedNow might be prone to some of the same concerns shadowing CBDC development.  Some lawmakers and political leaders, especially among Republicans, have expressed concerns that a CBDC might be prone to surveillance by authorities, or that they might be able to censor transactions. Current Florida Governor and GOP presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis, for example, has repeatedly said that he would ban a CBDC if elected president as he sees it as a form of “government-sanctioned surveillance.”  “If FedNow does indeed become a programmable CBDC, then it could theoretically be used to block payments for items the government doesn’t favor or to cut out people from the financial system who are seen as threatening in some way to governing authorities, aka, political opponents,” said Dave Weisberger, CEO and co-founder of CoinRoutes said. “In that situation, things could get dystopian very quickly.”  Officials at the Fed have been studying the potential for a government-issued digital currency, and Fed chair Jerome Powell himself has repeatedly vouched for the exploration. As preparation for the G20 Summit in India earlier this week, The Bank of International Settlement published a report laying out central banks’ efforts to prepare for a CBDC and the benefits of such.  “The problem of course is that the government is going to have to bit ways over the digital token and they’re going to be able to permission them and censor them for certain types of people in certain types of ways, or certain types of transactions,” said Bianco.  Even banks themselves are skeptical about FedNow, criticizing the lack of leadership structure or a clear business plan, all while the system is financed through taxpayer money, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI), wrote in a blog post. Other experts have pointed out that some banks benefit from slow payments and make it part of their business model.  It may be a case of strange bedfellows – with banks and blockchain purists – incumbents and disruptors – united in their skepticism of FedNow.  Jim Iuorio, managing director of TJM Institutional Services and a veteran futures and options trader, noted that bitcoin (BTC) was invented partly as an alternative to the heavily regulated and monitored traditional financial system.  “Cynics see the launch of Fednow to be a move toward an eventual central bank digital currency and a cashless society,” Iuorio said. ”They argue that the government having access to every transaction opens the door to authoritarianism and abuse.”",NEUTRAL,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | FIAT | MARKET | REGULATION,Helene Braun,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/business/2023/07/21/federal-reserves-fednow-launch-triggers-fresh-speculation-over-digital-dollar,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b3f313115328ed1a8b80d8a1dffee142c6fb07bc-1920x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Most can agree that the current state of custody concerns, complicated seed phrases and overall user experience make wallets one of the biggest barriers to entry for Web3 newcomers.  While several companies in the space claim they’re working to ease the process of connecting a wallet and purchasing a non-fungible token (NFT), some developers in the space are updating the infrastructure to do so. Specifically, the Ethereum blockchain which many NFTs already live on.  ERC-6551, an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) created in February by a group of developers and individuals from Web3 venture studio Future Primitive and NFT creator platform Manifold, allows NFTs to operate as wallets themselves. From receiving token airdrops to purchasing derivative collectibles, ERC-6551 opens up an integrated mechanism for custodying digital assets within a digital asset itself.  For example, let’s say a profile picture (PFP) NFT collection implements an ERC-6551 token standard. If the collection has its own native cryptocurrency, the NFT could custody those tokens. It could also custody derivative NFTs such as digital wearables – earning ERC-6551 the nickname “backpack” wallet.  Although the proposal has yet to officially become a token standard, it's already being adopted by protocols and projects in the space.  See Also: What Are EIP and ERC and How Are They Connected?  On Monday, decentralized social media platform Lens announced its latest update, which allows ERC-6551 enabled tokens to custody their own profiles on the site. In May, fashion designer Jeff Staple’s Web3 studio Stapleverse implemented ERC-6551s into its SAPIENZ NFT collection, allowing holders to own external NFTs through their token-bound accounts.  According to Dune Analytics data from SeaLaunch, a group of pseudonymous blockchain researchers, at time of writing there are nearly 3,775 ERC-6551 based accounts created to date, with over 2,800 created since the beginning of July.  While the conversations around ERC-6551 tokens have been positive, some Web3 users still question the purpose of a token-bound account. Why do people need an NFT with its own “backpack” wallet?  ERC-6551s can foster a burgeoning ecosystem of new projects. The standard can help solve problems associated with trading NFTs and have the potential to redefine utility across Web3.  From EIP to ERC  At the core of ERC-6551 is a desire to improve upon the digital ownership infrastructure within Web3. For Future Primitive founding developers Benny Giang and Jayden Windle, it spurred them to author EIP-6551 to not only improve upon their own projects, but also to help others in the space.  Windle told CoinDesk that the idea came to the team when attempting to build the technology stack to support on-chain avatars owning their own digital clothing items. After many hours spent racking their brains for a solution, they thought – what if you could assign wallets to NFTs?  “Our characters could actually own their clothing because they had a wallet, and they could buy, sell and trade that clothing because the clothing was enough to use,” said Windle. “It solved a lot of really interesting problems on the indexing side and on the smart contract side, and was just a really nice, clean solution to this problem for a project.”  After successfully building the infrastructure to do so for their own project, Windle said he and Giang realized that the technology could bring value to many collections and ideas beyond Future Primitive.  “Our NFT project is cool, but every NFT should be able to own assets and take actions on chain,” said Windle. “That was when we realized that this would be best suited as an EIP because they’re designed to foster consensus around a common pattern and a common idea.”  From there, Windle and Giang penned the ERC-6551 proposal alongside Alanah Lam, founding product designer at Future Primitive, Manifold founder Wilkins Chung and software engineer Paul Sullivan, as well as co-authors Steve Jang and Raymond Huynh.  According to the proposal, ERC-6551 is Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible, meaning it’s operable on networks including sidechain Polygon and layer 2s like Arbitrum and Optimism. It’s also operable on top of an existing NFT created with the ERC-721 token standard, which many Ethereum NFTs use.  The growing utility of ERC-6551  Token-bound accounts have already opened up a plethora of use cases that developers in the space are beginning to implement. With a “backpack wallet,” users can assign digital ownership to an asset, which can look different across many verticals of Web3.  Giang told CoinDesk that the early use cases he’s envisioning for ERC-6551 NFTs include gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), infrastructure tooling and more.  In a Web3 game, the standard could allow avatars to hold in-game collectibles or cryptocurrencies, or a DAO could grant additional NFTs to members that signify their participation or contributions. Decentralized social networks could let users represent their identities through wallet-bound NFTs.  “A lot of the blue chips are already experimenting and playing around with the standard,” said Giang. “There's a high likelihood before the end of this year, maybe in the next few months, that a lot of the blue chips will have something using 6551 or token-bound accounts.”  Another example is the capability for co-creation on various NFT projects. SeaLaunch told CoinDesk that within digital fashion, this might look like multiple artists contributing NFTs to an on-chain garment, expanding the range of creativity within the industry.  “By combining these layers, a unique digital fashion item is born, showcasing transparent on-chain attribution to each creator involved,” said Sea Launch. “This opens up the possibilities for collaborative digital fashion creation, allowing for diverse artistic contributions and enabling the creation of truly one-of-a-kind digital garments.”  While digital fashion may be ready for ERC-6551, so are NFT loyalty programs. Fonz Olvera, CEO of Web3 ticketing platform Tokenproof told CoinDesk that the technology allows wallet ownership to extend one step further, helping brands better structure their Web3 engagement models.  “The membership into a loyalty program could be the parent token, and points, stamps or badges could be owned by that parent token,” said Olvera.  He also added that beyond Web3 loyalty, ERC-6551 tokens could facilitate NFT staking services, allowing holders to earn passive income on their tokens.  “ERC-6551 could be used in order for those fungible tokens or coins to accrue directly to the staked asset instead of accruing separately to the parent wallet,” said Olvera.  It's still a proposal…  While ERC-6551 is gaining tracking across the Web3 space, it’s not yet an official token standard. In its early days, users have noticed certain tendencies within the structure that could pose challenges as the token becomes more adopted.  Matt Stephenson, Head of Cryptoeconomics at crypto investment firm Pantera Capital, told CoinDesk that the “recursive nature” of tokens with token-bound accounts may introduce small friction when transferring assets.  “If you have a pair of NFT shoes that has a pair of laces, that have a friendship charm on the lace, we have a nested structure where the shoe owns the lace which owns a little charm,” said Stephenson. “It definitely was the case at one point that it's more expensive to transfer the charm only.”  Windle specified that ERC-6551 wallets are smart contract wallets, which generally cost more gas fees to use. However, he noted that gas prices for transfers are still fairly low, even when network fees are higher than normal.  There were also early speculations that an ERC-6551 token standard could allow soulbound NFTs, which are non-transferrable, to be sold, and therefore no longer soulbound.  In response to luxury brand Louis Vuitton’s sale of $39,000 soulbound digital trunks, Jeff Krantz, co-founder of crypto security platform Fire said in a tweet that if the NFT was purchased by an ERC-6551 wallet, the buyer could sell the whole wallet. He claimed this was the “best way to do it,” in order to allow buyers to sell the expensive trunk if they didn’t want to hold it forever.  Windle told CoinDesk that soulbound NFTs purchased by an ERC-6551 wallet are, in fact, transferable.  “The token is still soulbound in the sense that it is bound to a single account, but not in the pure sense of being bound to a single owner,” said Windle.  The future of ERC-6551  Before ERC-6551 graduates from its status as a proposal and becomes a legitimate token standard, new examples of utility will likely emerge as projects test out their own use cases of token-bound accounts.  “The true potential of token bound accounts is yet to be fully realized, and as the ecosystem evolves, we can expect their adoption to expand into more use cases and industries, unlocking new frontiers of value creation, ownership, and interaction,” SeaLaunch told CoinDesk.  But the fundamental purpose of a token-bound account is digital ownership.  Stephenson told CoinDesk that on the philosophical side of ERC-6551 ownership, it’s exciting that the narrative allows for a digital asset to possess its own on-chain assets. He said that at the end of the day, there’s still one user behind the token-bound account that owns the wallet and its assets.  “You can say, technically, couldn't the owner just own both of those [NFTs] and pretend it's part of the story?” said Stephenson. “If we're going to treat [the NFTs] as real, treating them as owning a thing, just feels more natural to me than saying the owner happens to own both.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | ETH | TECHNOLOGY | ARB | AIRDROP,Cam Thompson,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/learn/what-is-erc-6551-unpacking-the-backpack-wallet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/929731085bad9786a93eeaf2005b5e6b2c7b5c2e-1280x800.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

MKR briefly rose above $1,200 early Friday for the first time since last August, then pared some of its gains to change hands at around $1,148. The token is up 28% over the past week, significantly outperforming the 4.6% decline of the CoinDesk Market Index, which tracks the broader crypto market’s performance.  The price action occurred as the lending protocol activated a token buyback scheme on Wednesday, removing MKR supply from the market. The so-called Smart Burn Engine periodically allocates excess DAI stablecoins from Maker’s surplus buffer to purchase MKR from a UniSwap pool, a governance proposal explains.  The program was deployed earlier this month, and it went live Wednesday once the surplus buffer exceeded $50 million.  In the last 24 hours, the protocol bought back some $230,000 worth of MKR, according to blockchain data by Etherscan. At this pace, the protocol is on track to purchase about $7 million in tokens in the next month.  The token’s total market capitalization is about $1 billion, so the buyback would reduce 0.7% of the supply per month at current prices.  Maker is one of the largest and oldest DeFi lending protocols, and also issues the $4.6 billion DAI stablecoin. It is led by a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), in which MKR holders vote on governance proposals.  The protocol has been increasingly investing DAI’s reserve assets in traditional investment products such as bank loans and government bonds to earn revenue from yields. MakerDAO also is undergoing a major overhaul that includes upgrading the DAI and MKR tokens, and breaking up its structure into smaller, autonomous organizations called SubDAOs that could issue their own tokens.",POSITIVE,MKR | DAI,BLOCKCHAIN | MARKET | MKR | TRADING | DAI,Krisztian Sandor,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/makerdaos-mkr-soars-28-in-a-week-as-token-buyback-scheme-goes-live,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/402964217502c0b1d0b170c7972d1a5b60f600af-1686x1022.png?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

With the entire cryptocurrency market now in calmer waters, it seems the borrow program isn’t gaining as much traction as hoped. According to Coinbase, it is making the decision in order to focus on other products. “the offerings that our customers care about most.” “We regularly evaluate our products to ensure we’re prioritizing the offerings that our customers care about most. After much consideration, we have made the decision to wind down Coinbase Borrow,” the blog post read. Related Reading: Binance Burns $480 Million In BNB, Will Price Recover? Regulatory issues could also have played a role in the exchange’s decision. The California-based exchange has been under scrutiny from US regulators for years. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently sued Coinbase on June 6, for its staking program and for making billions of dollars in its role as a middleman for the alleged trading of unregistered securities. Cryptocurrency regulations on trading, borrowing, and staking remain unclear. However, Coinbase says the SEC can only pursue its claims if cryptocurrencies and staking services have been established as securities.

From Bitcoin to Stablecoins It has often been suggested, especially in the mainstream media, that Bitcoin was one of the main currencies in which to transact illicit activities. However, recent insights suggest a shift in this trend. Originally reported by CoinTelegraph, Tara Annison, the former head of technical crypto advisory at Elliptic, stated that the criminal underbelly of the crypto world is now leaning more towards stablecoins, particularly USD Coin (USDC), over Bitcoin. Annison, during her presentation at EthCC in Paris, delved into the changing dynamics of crypto-related crimes. She pointed out that Bitcoin's decreasing popularity among criminals can be attributed to the rise of decentralised finance protocols, mixing services, and most notably, stablecoins. These digital assets, especially those pegged to the dollar, offer new, more discreet avenues for illicit transactions. Why the shift to stablecoins? Annison explains that assets like USDC offer easy access and can be effortlessly laundered through decentralised exchanges (DEXs). She remarked that in her view the deep liquidity and substantial volume on these platforms make them ideal for such activities. However, it's not all gloomy. Annison highlighted a potential advantage for law enforcement agencies. Centralised issuers, such as Circle, have the capability to freeze specific USDC tokens. This means that before these criminals can convert their assets into fiat currencies through DEXs or centralised platforms, their funds can be halted. Annison commented that in her opinion we are witnessing a rise in blacklisted USDC and USDT accounts, effectively freezing assets that criminals can't access. $7.8 billion in scams Annison went on to say that stablecoins aren't the only concern. Ponzi and pyramid schemes continue to plague the crypto sector. A staggering $7.8 billion has been syphoned off from unsuspecting victims through these scams. Moreover, criminals are constantly innovating, employing techniques like chain swapping and asset swapping to obscure their tracks, using a myriad of tools, from DEXs to mixers, in order to muddy the trail for blockchain analytics firms. In the light of crypto scams decreasing by 46% compared to previous years, Annison believes the current bear market in crypto is a significant factor, suggesting that with reduced hype and lower prices, the sector becomes less lucrative for criminals.

The new service will allow collectors to store their valuable physical items in climate-controlled vaults and leverage a blockchain-powered asset management system. According to the site, the service works by authenticating high-end physical collectibles and organizes the transportation process of the goods to a high-security facility.  According to the platform, the vault will cater to vintage cars, limited-edition sneakers, fine art, fine china and ""everything in between.""  Those interested in vaulting their items with Americana will have to go through a consultation with the team ""to develop a custom intake plan."" Once the rigorous authentication and intake process is completed, each asset will be issued a unique digital certificate of authenticity.  Through the Americana website, users can show off their collections, list items for sale and accept offers.  Backed by Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian's Seven Seven Six VC firm and NFT marketplace OpenSea, the company raised $6.9 million in seed funding in May 2022. Americana also launched its Something membership token then, which granted holders early access to its beta site. All 9,500 tokens, each priced at 0.069 ETH, or about $130 at the time, sold out. As of writing, the floor price of the tokens has dropped to 0.015 ETH, or about $28.  Americana CEO Jake Frey, who previously founded a private design studio specializing in digital products and has worked with Apple, Snapchat, Shopify and Twitter, said in a press release that the platform was created to remove friction associated with buying, selling and storing high-end collectibles.  ""At Americana, we empower physical pieces with digital luxuries,"" he said. ""Bridging the gap, we bring the excitement and convenience of the digital world to tangible collectibles. It's about merging the best of both realms for an elevated experience.""  To start, the platform will allow select creators, including contemporary artists Dustin Yellin, Danny Cole and Tom Sachs, to build profiles and offer verified collectibles to Americana members. The platform will be viewable to all collectors whether or not they have a Something membership token.  Americana is also ensuring that secondary royalties are enforced, taking aim at competitors that have recently scaled back on the practice.  In recent years, the capabilities of digital fashion have significantly expanded, with brands and platforms working to bridge the gap between physical garments and digital collectibles.

42393013,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEl6n,1689954944,"To Survive the New Era of Robot Spam, Look to Crypto’s History","This is David Z. Morris, filling in for Michael Casey to talk about so-called artificial intelligence, the threats it poses to the future – and how crypto could help mitigate them.  As Michael would surely agree, there are no real days off in crypto. I was reminded myself when I recently spent a long weekend at the fantastic Readercon fiction convention. Inevitably, I missed some important crypto stories, but I also got some up-close insight into another looming novelty: the existential threat that automated large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 pose to the entire internet.  You’re reading Money Reimagined, a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. Subscribe to get the full newsletter here.  That might sound hyperbolic. But at Readercon, I met Neil Clarke, founder and editor of the top-tier science fiction magazine Clarkesworld, which along with other fiction publications has become a canary in the coal mine of A.I. run amok. The rise of ChatGPT has inundated these journals with a flood of fake GPT-generated story submissions, a plague so severe Clarkesworld was forced to temporarily pause submissions this February, threatening the work and livelihoods of real authors.  “I’ve been calling it spam,” says Clarke, “Because that’s what it is. I sometimes refuse to even call it ‘artificial intelligence.’ You can’t humanize these things. It’s not like the science fiction of movies where it’s aware. It’s a statistical [language] model.”  The mention of spam should raise the antenna of longtime cryptocurrency watchers: the same problem lay at the very origins of Bitcoin.  Between 1998 and 2002, computer scientist Adam Back developed the concept of “Hashcash,” primarily intended to combat e-mail spam by requiring a tiny payment to send one. Back and his ideas became foundational to the development of Bitcoin, and he’s now CEO of crypto developer Blockstream.  Two decades later, with robotic barbarian hordes poised to swamp human communication systems, it might be time to revisit the Hashcash concept.  Large Language Hustlers  “ChatGPT came out in late November,” Clarke says, “And we immediately started seeing submissions using it. The first people to adopt it were the ones already submitting plagiarized works. It was readily embraced by people who were trying to make a quick buck off other people’s work.”  As they faced down the spam problem, Clarke says he and his team quickly realized the attack was coordinated. YouTube and TikTok channels focused on get-rich-quick schemes were promising viewers they could make thousands of dollars by submitting GPT-generated stories to fiction magazines like Clarkesworld. Clarkesworld pays a few hundred dollars per story, depending on length – not much more than beer money in some parts of the world, but extremely meaningful in others.  Those fraudulent promises from online grifters seem to have spread fast. Clarke says he received 54 AI-generated submissions in December. In January, he got 117 fake stories. In February, the number hit 514 before Clarke closed submissions midday on February 20.  “And that morning alone,” he says, “we had 50.”  Clarkesworld has a small staff, who normally review about 1,100 submissions a month. So the accelerating flood of trash threatened to overwhelm them, and solutions weren’t obvious.  “We have an open submission process, specifically designed to welcome in new writers and new voices,” says Clarke. “So we could close submissions from certain locations [to fight spam], but we also have legitimate authors coming in from those countries. And we’ve been told things like, ‘The payment for this story will cover my bills for a month.’”  “Authors like that are getting buried. The A.I. submissions hurt new authors, and authors who might not be from communities that are well-connected.” This is one clear way auto-generated content threatens to make the internet worse for human beings – particularly those at the margins.  “If you go back 15 or 20 years when we took submissions on paper,” Clarke says, “just the cost of postage was enough to decrease submissions from outside the U.S., Canada, and U.K. substantially. And as soon as you have digital submissions, we had this flood of international submissions.” That has led to a huge diversification of the fiction world – a creative renaissance that’s now threatened by the rise of LLMs.  Clarke is also a coder, which gave him useful tools for addressing the spam challenge. He began associating more metadata with submissions, such as whether they came through a VPN and the length of the user’s session. These and other criteria are now used as part of a “points system” that places stories more likely to be fake further down a review queue. This helps real authors get read first, but also ensures that every submission is eventually reviewed.  Finally, if a story is determined to be LLM-generated, the submitter is permanently banned from the system.  Those measures have helped Clarkesworld reopen submissions, for now – but a continued rise in the volume of spam they’re dealing with would mean the solution is only temporary.  “Worse than the Worst Human Writer”  One important aspect of Clarke’s experience is that the actual quality of the robotic submissions has been abysmally low. They’re almost instantly recognizable to a human reader, and have no actual chance of being published.  “ChatGPT3 was writing at a level below the worst human writers,” says Clarke, who after two decades as an editor knows exactly what the worst looks like. “GPT4 is getting closer to the worst human writers, but even that’s still rare.”  “The common thing is that they have perfect grammar, they have perfect spelling,” Clarke continues. “But the stories themselves don’t make a lot of sense. They jump over important things. They’ll start out with a basic premise, like ecological collapse, and introduce some scientists who can solve the problem, and then suddenly they’ve solved the problem. It’s missing the middle of the story, and bookending it with stereotypical openings and closings, done very poorly.”  That sounds a lot like Ted Chiang’s recent characterization of ChatGPT’s output as “a blurry JPEG of the internet.” This manifest crappiness happily debunks much of the brain-dead hype around LLMs. But it also makes the image of talented (and wildly underpaid) editors being forced to sift through the dross all the more depressing.  The Promise of Small, Refundable Fees  Another option for reducing spam submissions is a submission fee. Clarke says he has no desire or plan to implement a fee, thanks to overriding ethical and creative concerns. In particular, a submission fee could limit access, which the community of science fiction writers strongly opposes.  But beyond that, the technical shortcomings of current global payments infrastructure also make charging an anti-spam fee impractical, even if Clarke wanted to.  For instance, Clarke says to charge a submission fee, he would need to be able to refund it, for instance to writers whose stories were accepted, or simply not AI-generated. An ideal spam-blocking fee would also be quite small – certainly far lower than the $25 or $30 worth of postage that was keeping away developing-world authors in the pre-internet era.  But there’s no way to do that with current tech.  “Tell me a credit card company where I can refund almost all of it. I’d lose the account,” says Clarke. As any good crypto bro knows, credit cards also don’t play well with small payments. But those aren’t even the biggest issue.  “There are also problems with trying to take payments in different parts of the world,” Clarke continues. “There are a number of African countries that credit card companies won’t work with. So that would eliminate authors. I’ve also had people suggest identity services, but those also have nation-sized holes in them. We need something that works for everybody.”  If you’re reading this, you already know where we’re headed: at least in principle, cryptocurrency and related systems could help mitigate Clarkesworld’s fake submission problem.  Requiring a small payment for all submissions would reduce low-quality submissions, lightening editors’ workloads, and compensating them for the spam that did come in. Because payments could be cheaply, quickly, and easily returned to real authors, the cost to actual human writers would be marginal. And because these systems are not confined by national borders, no real writers would be crowded out by the robo-regurgitators.  Though it would take considerable elaboration, some version of the same system may someday serve parallel purposes in less boutique settings. One can imagine a Steem-like system of staking incentives being used to punish automated posting on forums or social media, for instance. More elaborate decentralized identity systems, such as SpruceID, are more challenging and, for now, more nascent, but could have even more profound potential.  To be clear, none of this should be necessary. LLMs are quickly being revealed as little more than parlor tricks, whose real utility is probably limited, at least in the near term, to short-form customer service and clickbait entertainment. (Take for instance CNET’s disastrous experiment with using GPT to write news articles).  The technology’s biggest impacts are instead seen in the spread of fourth-rate gibberish that wastes the time and brainpower of all the actual humans involved. But if this is what the god-princes of Silicon Valley see as the next frontier of venture capital riches, then it is the world we’ll have to live in. At the very least, crypto offers one hope for fighting back.",NEUTRAL,없음,BTC | TECHNOLOGY | TRADING,David Z.

42393006,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEkh9,1689954330,"'Razzlekhan,' Husband Agree to Plea Deal in Bitfinex Hack Laundering Case Worth Billions","A couple accused of laundering funds drained from crypto exchange Bitfinex in the 2016 hack have agreed to enter a plea deal with U.S. authorities, according to a person familiar with the matter.  Heather “Razzlekhan” Morgan and Ilya Lichtenstein, married New York residents who were arrested in February 2022, had faced allegations of money laundering and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. The U.S. Attorney has ordered the couple to forfeit billions of dollars worth of bitcoin, ether, stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, in addition to cash from their bank accounts, at the time of conviction, according to a court filing.  In February 2022 a judge granted bail to Morgan but not to Lichtenstein, after the defense argued the case against her was weaker than the one against him, that the only evidence against Morgan was she “allegedly received funds that are tied to the act” and that her health problems necessitated a release.  A plea deal would bring to a close one of the most dramatic criminal cases in the history of cryptocurrency, a field that has seen more than its share of scandals. It remains a mystery who hacked Bitfinex, at the time one of the largest such heists recorded, and Morgan's idiosyncratic music videos added a touch of comic relief to the affair. (This year, she got a new tech job while the case was pending.)  It is unclear how much time either defendant could serve behind bars. Last year, the pair faced two conspiracy charges each that posed a maximum sentence of 25 years. They have been ordered to appear for an arraignment and plea hearing on Aug. 3 before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, according to court records.  “It was the object of the conspiracy for the defendants, MORGAN and Lichtenstein, to unlawfully enrich themselves by laundering the proceeds of the hack and scheme to defraud the victim virtual currency exchange, Bitfinex and to prevent detection of the laundering activity,"" the new filing said.  Lawyers for neither Morgan nor Lichtenstein were immediately available to respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  Morgan and her husband were accused of laundering roughly 25,000 BTC and had access to another 94,000 BTC stolen – worth roughly $3.5 billion at the time of publication – stolen during an exploit of Bitfinex in 2016.  Federal officials were able to seize the 94,000 BTC when the couple were arrested in early 2022. Back then, the DOJ alleged the two conspired to launder these proceeds and heavily implied, but did not claim, they were the original hacker(s). Much of the remaining 25,000 BTC were transferred out over the past five years, through various wallets and darknet marketplaces.  The couple and their lawyers previously intended to fight the charges, alleging there were “many deficiencies in the Government’s proof and unsupported, conclusory leaps,” previous filings show. The first signs of a plea deal appeared in March 2022, when prosecutors told a court they were in talks with Morgan’s attorneys about a possible “resolution” to her case that would not include a trial.  Liechtenstein, a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, renewed his Russian passport in 2019, said prosecutors in February 2022. The duo traveled to Ukraine in 2019, where they allegedly created and updated various files in online accounts that contained information about money laundering. The defense said it was just a vacation.  The Department of Justice didn’t immediately respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.  UPDATE (July 10. 2023, 16:45 UTC): Adds details throughout.

Republican members of the Agriculture and Financial Services Committees of the United States House have introduced this bill to create a regulatory framework for digital assets. Submitted on July 20, the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act represents an effort by US lawmakers to promote collaboration between two major federal regulators. These include the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 212-page bill aims to tackle regulatory gaps by establishing a comprehensive framework. The framework is expected to address the specific risks associated with various digital asset-related activities. Related Reading: Chainlink Holds Strong With 19% Rally – More Gains In The Pipeline? Crypto Regulation Framework: Protecting Consumers And Fostering Innovation The bill has been co-submitted by Glenn Thompson, Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, and French Hill, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Digital Assets. It primarily aims to safeguard consumers and promote innovation within the United States. In addition to its consumer protection and innovation promotion goals, the bill also establishes criteria for classifying a digital asset as a commodity. The primary focus lies on decentralization. If a digital asset meets these conditions, it becomes eligible to be traded as a digital asset commodity on SEC-registered digital asset trading systems. As part of this regulatory framework, market participants would be required to adhere to enhanced and comprehensive disclosure standards. Furthermore, these participants may need to register with both relevant regulatory agencies for compliance purposes. The bill specifically outlines a streamlined process for crypto companies to register with two key financial regulators, the CFTC and the SEC. The bill also seeks to modernize and update the outdated US securities laws when it comes to crypto. One significant amendment proposed in the bill is requiring the SEC to take into consideration the aspect of “innovation” as it is imperative to consider innovation when making regulatory decisions or taking any enforcement actions. The bill stated: Securities laws and regulations do not account for many of the unique characteristics of digital assets. Focus On Integrating NFTs In Traditional Marketplaces Under the provisions of the crypto regulation bill, both the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would be obligated to collaborate with foreign regulators. The objective is to establish uniform and consistent regulatory standards for digital assets and related activities across international jurisdictions. This collaboration aims to reduce regulatory discrepancies. It also focuses on enhancing global cooperation and creating a more harmonized approach to governing the digital asset space. Additionally, the bill mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a comprehensive study on nonfungible tokens (NFTs). It also urges GAO to integrate NFTs within traditional marketplaces. This study will delve into various aspects of NFTs. This includes a study on their functioning, impact on markets, potential risks, and possible implications for consumers and investors. Related Reading: Is The Chainlink Top In?

42393007,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEkmH,1689953072,Crypto Liquidity Network Paradigm Leans Into DeFi With StarkWare,"Paradigm, which provides liquidity to institutional crypto derivatives traders, is branching into decentralized finance (DeFi) with the addition of Paradex, a decentralized perpetuals platform.  Paradigm, a separate entity from the venture capital firm of the same name, said Paradex is a hybrid derivatives exchange that combines the liquidity and performance of centralized finance (CeFi) with DeFi’s transparency, trustlessness and self-custody. The platform uses the newly announced appchains from scaling-technology giant StarkWare, according to a Friday announcement at the StarknetCC event in Paris.  The system was built partly to address the lack of trust in centralized finance following the multibillion-dollar collapse of FTX due to a management-driven liquidity crisis. The exchange also aims to take on the fragmentation across legacy CeFi risk engines (software that analyzes market risks), which impacts capital efficiency and leads to lower liquidity.  StarkWare, the $8 billion-valued company behind the Ethereum layer 2 network Starknet, said earlier this week that it was working on ”Starknet Stacks,” software tools to make it easier for developers to create custom layer 2 blockchains. The custom chains can create “appchains:” blockchains that are optimized for a specific application. StarkWare and Paradigm collaborated on Paradex for six months to make it possible to introduce the system as a layer 2 appchain. They plan to work together to develop Paradex into a layer 3, which offers greater scalability and more control over the technology stack.  “As we began evaluating blockchain scaling technologies that would enable Paradex’s ambitious vision, it became clear that we needed a solution that would not only delivers scalability, but also control and customization. A private instance of Starknet, or Appchain, provides this in abundance,” Nafaa Hendaoui, head of product at Paradex, said in a press release.  Singapore-based Paradigm was founded in 2016 by traditional finance veterans Anand Gomes and Michal Koonin, who both spent years on trading floors at the likes of KeyBanc Capital Markets and Wolverine Trading. Paradigm has received backing from asset manager GCP Capital, liquidity provider GSR and investment firm CMT Digital, among others.

According to TRM, multiple pro-ISIS groups in Tajikistan raised around $2 million in Tron-based USDT during 2022. They have been recruiting fighters for ISIS’s affiliate in Afghanistan, The Islamic State-Khorasan Province (ISKP). The groups used an unnamed centralized exchange to cash out the funds, so TRM was able to trace the money and notify the exchange.  The exchange, in turn, identified the user and reported him to the local authorities. As a result, on June 22, senior ISIS fundraiser Shamil Hukumatov was arrested in Turkey, TRM wrote.  Another pro-ISIS group raised over $517,000 using an account on an Indonesia-based exchange, according to TRM. The campaign was aimed at freeing ISIS members who are being held in Syrian interment camps. Interestingly, the donations to that campaign often came in quite large amounts, around $10,000 each, the report reads.  ISIS affiliates in Pakistan have raised a more modest amount of $40,000 over the past 12 months, pretending to help the victims of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023, TRM said.  Al-Azaim Foundation for Media Production, a pro-ISIS media organization in Afghanistan, also used crypto for fundraising purposes. TRM said it had identified wallets controlled by the group that received $10,000.  Crypto has been utilized by terrorists and insurgent groups around the world over the past few years. In 2021, global crypto exchange Binance reportedly froze the accounts controlled by the militant wing of Hamas, which accumulated around $80,000 in a single month, CoinDesk reported.

15144463,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543715,1689949810,Riding The Ripple Effect: What’s Next For Stellar Lumens (XLM)?,"The comeback of the Stellar Lumens (XLM) price keeps going on. In the last 24 hours, XLM has risen by another 15%, bringing the Ripple competitor’s price in line with XRP. Indeed, both tokens have risen by close to 65% (at this stage) since the summary judgment in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Remarkably, the relationship between Stellar Lumens (XLM) and Ripple’s XRP has been an intriguing tale of correlation and decoupling. As the market reacted to the recent developments in the Ripple-SEC battle, XLM followed suit, experiencing a remarkable price surge. However, as the broader market conditions cast their shadows, the question arises: Can Stellar Lumens maintain its newfound independence and continue its upward trajectory? The Correlation Between XLM and XRP It is no secret that Stellar Lumens and Ripple’s XRP share many similarities in their blockchain technologies and use cases. Moreover, the founder’s Jed McCaleb’s connection to Ripple adds another layer of intrigue, as investors hope that XLM will not be deemed a security by regulators. Related Reading: Stellar (XLM) Surges Over 43% In One Week, What’s Pushing It? This connection has often resulted in XLM mirroring the price movements of XRP. The market’s anticipation of developments for Ripple being equally impactful for Stellar has often led to such correlated movements, just like last week after the Ripple ruling. However, in recent days, Stellar Lumens has managed to stand on its own feet, showcasing its ability to decouple from the fortunes of XRP. One factor for this may have been its partnership with MoneyGram, which yielded the innovative B2B service called MoneyGram Access. This service enables the conversion of the stablecoin USDC into cash worldwide through MoneyGram’s branch network, tapping into Stellar’s ledger for seamless execution. This strategic collaboration has not only bolstered Stellar’s use case but also may catalyzed its recent surge in price. Related Reading: Stellar Makes Surprise 70% Rally – Start Of Something Big For XLM? With the integration of Access into various applications and fiat ramps, XLM’s demand and utility is substantially boosted. For instance, the HoneyCoin app’s integration of Access for straightforward cash out in multiple African countries and the United Kingdom might have contributed to Stellar’s outperformance relative to XRP in recent days. We’re excited to share @honeycoinapp users can now cash out of their USDC balance at supported @MoneyGram locations in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Nigeria, Ghana, and the UK 🥳️ Another real-world use case for @Circle’s USDC on Stellar.https://t.co/0JKNhdJMx3 — Stellar (@StellarOrg) July 17, 2023 A second factor for XLM’s recently strong performance could be the extremely high interest on the futures market. The open interest for Stellar Lumens has skyrocketed to over $120 million yesterday, a level not seen since the peak of the bull market in November 2021. Notably, this phenomenon is similar to XRP which has also seen open interest soar to prior record levels. Stellar Lumens Price Outlook Despite experiencing a sharp rally, Stellar Lumens still remains in rather bearish territory when looking at the 1-week chart. For this week, it’s crucial that the XLM price regains the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level at $0,1583 as well as the 200-week EMA at $0,1597 (blue line). With the weekly RSI at 73, another leg up could be possible. On the 1-day time frame, XLM remains above all moving averages (EMAs). For a further bullish trajectory, it’s important that Stellar hold above the support at $0.1250. Should this happen, XLM could experience a further 35% rally towards the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level. However, a drop below the support level at $0.1250 would challenge the bullish view.

42393011,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEl1f,1689948294,"DeFi Protocol Conic Finance Hacked for 1,700 Ether","Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Conic Finance said Friday that it had suffered an exploit that allowed an attacker to grab over 1,700 ether (ETH), worth over $3.6 million at current prices, that affected one of its Omnipools.  Security firm BlockSec said that the root cause of the attack was price manipulation caused by ""read-only reentrancy."" Reentrancy is a common bug that allows attackers to trick a smart contract by making repeated calls to a protocol in order to steal assets. A call is an authorization for the smart contract address to interact with a user’s wallet address.  Conic Finance, which went live on March 1, allows users to deposit tokens into its Omnipools, a new product that diversifies exposure across the Curve ecosystem while increasing rewards. The protocol attracted millions of dollars in capital shortly after going live, suggesting huge demand for such a product.  Each Omnipool allocates liquidity of a single asset into different Curve pools. All Curve liquidity provider (LP) tokens get staked on Convex to boost Curve (CRV) rewards earnings. Convex (CNX), another Curve ecosystem token, is also rewarded, as is Conic (CNC), Conic’s native token.  Meanwhile, Conic Finance developers tweeted that they were continuing to investigate the root cause of the exploit and were consulting with relevant parties.  The developers added that they had closed the faulty pool that apparently allowed the hack to take place. ""We have disabled ETH Omnipool deposits on the Conic front end,"" they wrote.",NEGATIVE,CRV | ETH,BLOCKCHAIN | CRV | ETH | MARKET | MINING,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/21/defi-protocol-conic-finance-hacked-for-1700-ether,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/b6706b9b5e2d90eda477c46d9b58442435abbd8a-3348x1883.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

Proof Collective Drops New Collection Moonbirds, the once-celebrated NFT brand, is making a comeback with the launch of its 20,000-piece collection, Mythics, which is also the latest Ethereum profile picture (PFP) collection. Proof Collective, the company behind Moonbirds, aims to rekindle interest among NFT collectors after facing a significant decline in sales since its first release in April 2022. The Mythics collection is the result of nearly a year of development and will be introduced gradually. Proof revealed that it will unveil 100 new NFTs today, followed by an additional 100 NFTs daily for the next 200 days. Half of the 100 new NFTs revealed daily would be randomly selected claimed eggs, while the other half would be 50 Oddities chosen to be burned. The slow rollout is a strategic move to enrich the underlying intellectual property and keep the community engaged. More About The Mythics Collection The upcoming Mythics collection is considered a more genuine follow-up to Moonbirds than its predecessor, Oddities. The team at Proof Collective delved deep into the lore of the Moonbirds world to ensure that the new collection offers an engaging and entertaining experience for collectors. The new collection has been classified into three categories, depending on their functionality and power - the stone eggs, legendary eggs, and runic eggs. The first two types are rarer as they consist of only 20% of the collection each. All these eggs can spawn a specific number of Mythic forms; for legendary eggs, it is three; for runic eggs, it is two; and a stone egg can only spawn one. The person who is minting the NFT gets to choose which form of Mythic to spawn from each type of egg. Change In Licensing Model Once minted and in possession of a Mythic NFT, the holder will have complete commercial rights over the artwork and even be able to use the characters’ IP. This is a major change from the two earlier Moonbirds collections, which followed a Creative Commons CC0 licensing model. As a result, anyone could commercially reproduce and use the NFT artworks from those collections, even without owning the NFT. Will Moonbirds Regain Their Popularity? The cooling interest in the NFT market has impacted Moonbird sales, with average sale prices plummeting almost tenfold from their initial high. Led by co-founder and CEO Kevin Rose and supported by top crypto venture capitalist a16z, the Proof is expanding the Moonbirds brand lore to rekindle interest. Rose said, “With Mythics, we’re really trying to give our community a new experience that links together the Proof ecosystem and expands the storytelling that started with Moonbirds. I’m so proud of how hard our teams have been working on this launch, with the goal of expanding Moonbirds' storytelling both through art and technology.” Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

MKR Price Outlook Over the last day, the MRK token has witnessed several steep rise and fall. The digital asset reached a day-high of $1,203 at 2:30 am UTC on July 21, a 20% increase from its July 20 opening price. Related Reading: Best Bitcoin Roulette Sites And Crypto Roulette Games MKR had lost momentum shortly after the $1,203 peak spike, falling to $1,134. However, it continued the fluctuations before regaining momentum for a more bullish rise. At the time of writing, Maker’s price is changing hands at $1,162, with a 17.63% 24-hour price increase. Maker’s current price is 26% higher than its value seven days ago and it may surpass $1,200 if it sustains the current bullish rally. A close look at MKR’s sudden price resurgence suggests the token might be riding on some other bullish waves. Possible Reasons Behind Maker’s Sudden Price Surge Maker’s dramatic price surge may be due to recent developments in the MakerDAO ecosystem. On-chain sleuth, Lookonchain, reported some conspicuous activities by top VC firms Andreessen Horowitz’s a16z and CMS Holdings, which are suspected to be responsible for the price surge. According to the report, a16z recently deposited large chunks of Maker tokens to Coinbase. The venture capital company deposited 12,864 MKR tokens worth approximately $12.6 million at the time. The firm also reportedly transferred another 6,900 MKR, worth $8 million by today’s exchange rates, to a new address, presumably with plans to deposit the funds on an exchange. Currently, a16z holds around 12,396 MKR tokens worth ~$14.4 million. Also, Lookonchain reported that CMS, a blockchain-focused private investment company, reduced its recently acquired MKR holdings. CMS Holdings deposited 525 MKR tokens worth $614,000 to Binance two hours before the sharp price surge. CMS previously withdrew 1,325 Maker tokens worth $1.54 million from Binance and Bitget at an average price of $793. The investment firm now holds 800 MKR, worth approximately $936,000. Implications Of a16z And CMS Holding’s Activities The unprecedented change in the token holdings of these top market players must have significantly contributed to the token’s price spike. The market positively reacted to the massive MKR sales, leading to increased trading volume and price surge. The sharp spike in MKR’s price can be interpreted this way: the trading activity of institutional investors like a16z and CMS Holdings draws more attention to Maker. The renewed interest could bring new buyers, exerting more demand pressure on the token and causing the price to spike further.

This potentially bodes badly for MKR as it could depress investor sentiment, causing massive selloffs which might push the price down.

The excitement surrounding this upward momentum has been palpable, but astute observers have noticed some intriguing indications that suggest this hike might not necessarily signify the peak for LINK. Such a notion is not mere speculation; instead, it finds its foundation in the actions of LINK holders and the patterns observed in trading activity. These compelling insights offer a glimpse into the future trajectory of Chainlink and its possibilities. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075 LINK Price Surge Fueled By Increased Accumulation, Network Activity LINK’s recent price surge has been underpinned by a significant token accumulation and notable activity on the Chainlink network. According to a LINK price report referencing Santiment data, the number of addresses holding between 0 to 1 million LINK has seen an incredible increase, potentially playing a pivotal role in driving the token’s value. Source: Santiment Coingecko data shows LINK registering an impressive $8.33 price, and a remarkable 24-hour rally of 19.0%. In the last week, the crypto has risen 15.0% in value. Source: Coingecko However, the surge appears far from an isolated event, as the accumulation rate has shown no signs of slowing down. Such consistent accumulation often suggests a growing conviction among investors and traders that LINK’s value may be on the verge of another substantial increase. Insights From Network Activity A telling metric, the adjusted price to Daily Active Addresses (DAA) divergence, provided intriguing insights into the Chainlink network’s current state. As the token’s price rose, the number of active addresses decreased. When looking at historical trends, this pattern has indicated previous upswings for the Chainlink network. Consequently, this data hints at the possibility of another impending price upswing for the LINK token. Bitcoin (BTC) trading at $29,855 today. Chart: TradingView.com The number of developers actively contributing to the Chainlink network has also experienced a significant increase since the first week of July. Technical analysts closely scrutinize chart patterns and price movements to identify potential trends and reversals. The recent rally in LINK’s price may have triggered breakout signals and attracted momentum traders, causing the price to surge even further. These technical indicators and chart patterns can act as self-fulfilling prophecies as traders react to them, potentially leading to a cascading effect on the token’s price. As the market evolves, tracking these key metrics, understanding market sentiment, and assessing broader market dynamics will be crucial in making informed decisions about LINK’s prospects.

42393023,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgElw5,1689944184,First Mover Americas: ProShares Dismisses Concerns Over Cost of Tracking Futures,"This article originally appeared in First Mover, CoinDesk’s daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Subscribe to get it in your inbox every day.  Latest Prices  Top Stories  ProShares, the issuer of the first U.S. bitcoin futures-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF), said concerns that costs associated with trading of the derivatives would lead to tracking errors are unfounded. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Fund began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in October, 2021, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin (BTC) without having to actually own the cryptocurrency. The ETF, the world's largest crypto fund, invests in regulated and cash-settled bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). From the very beginning, observers speculated BITO and other futures-based ETFs would significantly underperform bitcoin due to costs associated with rolling over, or selling expiring futures contracts and buying the next set. ""Concerns about the roll costs are misguided; BITO has closely tracked bitcoin's price since inception,"" Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, told CoinDesk in an email interview.  Cryptocurrencies slid Thursday with bitcoin (BTC) dipping to as low as $29,593 during U.S. afternoon hours, near its lowest point in a month. Ether (ETH) buckled below $1,900 to change hands 1% lower than 24 hours before. LINK, the native token of the Chainlink ecosystem, defied the slump and was the only crypto asset with sizable gains among the 40 largest tokens by market capitalization. The token surged 15% through the day, rising above $8 for the first time in nearly three months after Chainlink released this week an interoperability protocol that facilitates communication between blockchains and banks, tested by interbank communication system Swift. Ripple’s XRP pared some of its impressive gains from previous days, dropping some 6% in 24 hours. The token’s price almost doubled to 93 cents a week ago, following a partial court victory against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Coinbase Borrow, a program that allowed customers to receive regular currency loans of up to $1 million against their bitcoin (BTC) holdings, is shutting down. The company will instead focus its resources on products that “customers care about most,” a spokesperson told CoinDesk. Customers who hold loans through the program have until Nov. 20 to pay back any outstanding loan balances. Coinbase said in May that it was not allowing Coinbase Borrow customers to take out new loans as part of a regular process of re-evaluating its products. The exchange has been under increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators, specifically the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for its operations in the U.S., and has been doubling down on its businesses elsewhere.  Chart of the Day  The chart shows daily net flow of ether into wallets tied to centralized exchanges.  On Tuesday, centralized exchanges received a net 78,861.9 ETH, the highest single-day inflow since May 1.  Increased flow of coins into exchanges is often breeds price volatility.

15141625,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543672,1689942997,Is The Chainlink Top In? This Metric May Suggest So,"On-chain data shows that Chainlink’s social dominance has observed a large spike after its sharp price surge, a possible sign that the top may be here. Chainlink Social Dominance Rises To 3rd Largest In Cryptocurrency Sector According to data from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment, LINK is the third most trending asset in the market right now. The indicator of interest here is the “social dominance,” to understand which another metric needs to be looked at first: the social volume. The social volume measures the total amount of social media text documents (that is, text-based posts, threads, messages, etc.) that are making mentions of a given asset (which, in the current case, is Chainlink). This metric basically provides us with information about the degree of discussion that a particular coin is receiving across major social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and 4chan. Now, the aforementioned social dominance is a metric that compares the social volume of a cryptocurrency, with combined that of the top 100 assets by market cap in the space. Naturally, in the case of LINK, this indicator tells us how much talk related to the top coins in the market is coming from discussions centered on Chainlink alone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Near Crucial Retest: Which Of These Historical Patterns Will Repeat? Here is a chart that shows the trend in the LINK social dominance over the past month: Looks like the value of the metric has been quite high in recent days | Source: Santiment on Twitter As displayed in the above graph, Chainlink’s social dominance has registered a large spike following the rapid growth in the price of the cryptocurrency during the last couple of days. At the peak of this latest sharp surge, the asset’s value had climbed above the $8.4 mark, but since then the cryptocurrency has gone down a bit. Nonetheless, the price is still floating above $8.1 and the coin’s gains stand at an impressive 19%. Historically, rallies like these have attracted a lot of eyes to LINK, so it’s not particularly surprising that the cryptocurrency’s share of discussions in the sector has shot up. The scale of this rise, though, may be a slightly worrying sign. Chainlink is the third most talked about asset in the market right now, despite being only the 20th largest in terms of market cap. Related Reading: Market Alert: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Capitulation Triggers Cautionary Outlook Generally, when an asset is being talked about too much, the price can become more probable to show a move opposite to what this large crowd is expecting. Given that the latest discussions have come just after the rally, it would appear likely that these talks are in fact a sign of hype in the market. Such amount of hype has often proved to be a bearish signal for Chainlink, as tops become more likely to form in this kind of market environment. If a similar pattern follows now as well, then it may mean that the current social dominance spike is a sign that a local top is already in for the cryptocurrency. LINK Price At the time of writing, Chainlink is trading around $8.1, up 15% in the last week.

42393025,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEm6L,1689941180,"McDonald’s Opens McNuggets Land in the Metaverse, but McWhy?","McDonald’s is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Chicken McNuggets by opening something called McNuggets Land in metaverse platform The Sandbox.  It’s not the first time the fast food giant has shown interest in virtual worlds. The company filed a patent application to operate “a virtual restaurant online featuring home delivery” in 2022, but given the downturn in consumer and VC interest in Web3, it begs the question: why now, why this and is Grimace there?  Joining the land of McNuggets (which took me two attempts and over 10 minutes), you are greeted with pixelated McNugget characters such as “Coach McNugget” and his assistant, creatively named “Assistant Coach McNugget.”  Coach McNugget invites players to start the fun by finding four McDonald’s signs, and what gamer doesn’t seek an adventure like this? But off I went to find them. By playing the game, players can earn rewards including a 100,000 SAND shared prize pool (roughly $44,000) and “mystery boxes,” according to a press release.  The experience is spearheaded by the Hong Kong arm of McDonald’s, and Hong Kong users have the chance to win coupons as well as the big prize: “365-day free Chicken McNuggets.”  The blocky world is adorned with the catchphrase “Please Share” on signs and in cartoonish speech bubbles which is meant to encourage sharing nuggets with friends but comes off as a desperate plea. (I’m reminded of Jeb Bush’s sad call to “please clap” on a 2016 campaign trail stop.)  Randy Lai, the CEO of McDonald’s Hong Kong, said that “McDonald’s has always strived to deliver innovative experiences and Happy Moments” but unlike the recently viral Grimace birthday shake celebration in the U.S., the experience feels acutely marketed, with pixelated McNuggets spewing salesy phrases as part of the gamified experience. After being told which sauce each anthropomorphized nugget wanted to dip itself in before meeting its glorious end, I was ready to exit the virtual golden arches.  The CEO of the Sandbox, Sebastien Borget, said in a press release that ""collaborating with a global brand like McDonald's, with its extensive customer base, takes The Sandbox to a new level and brings us closer to realizing the ultimate goal of mass adoption of the metaverse.”  But does it? The Sandbox has had a number of big brands launch experiences and virtual worlds within its metaverse, including Adidas, Atari, Gucci and many others. I have personally found The Sandbox much easier to navigate and generally more fun than its rival Decentraland, which has struggled with maintaining a robust number of daily active users. That said, would I visit The Sandbox if my job wasn’t to cover Web3? Probably not.  Brands have been trying activations in various metaverses for years that often toe the line between whimsical and cringe from Snapple opening a bodega to Taco Bell hosting a metaverse wedding. When food or drink is introduced into these experiences, people can’t help but wonder what the point of Miller Lite’s Meta Life Bar or spice maker McCormick’s “House of Flavor” was, when you can’t eat, drink or even smell in the metaverse.  Recently, we saw convenience store 7-Eleven offer free Slurpee non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as part of their annual 7/11 day. The same day, snack brand Slim Jim launched the “Meataverse” and invited people to mint free “GigaJim” NFTs.  While both activations saw some enthusiasm on Twitter upon launch, these gimmicky launches have melted into irrelevance already, with very few people talking about or trading NFTs from either one less than two weeks later.  With much of the venture capital money moving from the metaverse to AI and giants like Disney shuttering their metaverse arms, brands throwing their hats in the Web3 ring now seems ill-timed. Launches which may have seemed silly but fun when crypto was riding high seem embarrassing and strange in 2023’s atmosphere of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crackdowns and ongoing crypto winter.  If brands like McDonald’s want to have success in Web3, they have to give people a better “why” than what McNuggets Land offers. Starbucks’ Odyssey, the coffee company’s Web3 loyalty program has hit snags along the way, but makes more inherent sense by tying in its customers’ existing behaviors (buying coffee in their real stores) with virtual rewards and digital collectibles that give extra value to activities they are already doing. Along the way, Starbucks is creating a community and gathering valuable feedback it can incorporate when it rolls out Odyssey for all customers.

Bitcoin lingered under $30,000 on Friday, dipping below the significant price level on Thursday at around traditional market opening hours in the U.S as the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NDX) index sold off during the day.  ""Crypto markets moved in line with global macro as traders repriced the risk of Fed hikes and central bank tightening given labor market resilience,"" Jon Knipper, director of crypto treasury management at digital asset advisory Republic Crypto, said.  ""Bulls have been on a tear this year,"" he added, noting the NDX's 40% and BTC's 80% year-to-date gains, ""and have been knocked back by the growing realization that tighter monetary conditions, for longer, are increasingly probable.""  Ether (ETH) shed over 3%. Among other large caps, XRP fell as much as 6% in the past 24 hours, while Cardano’s ADA and Avalanche’s AVAX fell 4% in the same period.  Elsewhere, stellar's XLM dropped as much as 6.6% as traders likely took profits after a 10% rise over the past week. Chainlink’s LINK traded flat following a 15% rise on Thursday – buoyed by the introduction of its CCIP protocol earlier this week. MKR, the governance token of lending platform MakerDAO, defied the broader market's price action, surging 11% in a day as investors welcomed the activation of a token buyback program.  New crypto oversight bill  Some of the selling pressure may have also arisen as U.S. House Republicans introduced a new digital assets oversight bill on Thursday that aims to establish a regulatory framework to protect investors in the crypto sector.  Analysts said parts of the revised bill exclude from the definition of ""digital assets"" a range of traditional securities such as stocks, bonds, ""transferable share[s],"" ""certificate[s] of interest or participation in any profit-sharing agreement,"" and so on.  “All they have to do is argue that a token is a ""transferable share"" ""a profit interest"" etc,” Gabriel Shapiro, general counsel at crypto fund Delphi Digital, tweeted. “XRP and such will be fine but DeFi can still be persecuted at will... actually the regulators will have expanded authority to do so.”  Meanwhile, the drop in prices caused over $66 million in liquidations in the past 24 hours, data from the analytics tool Coinglass shows. Slightly over 70% of these liquidations were on longs positions, or from traders betting on higher prices.  Liquidations occur when traders borrow funds from exchanges to bet on crypto prices using a relatively smaller initial capital, one that is forfeited when prices reach a predetermined liquidation level.

Ellison’s Diaries Could Be Used In Court The diaries, both handwritten and private Google documents, contain the rantings and ramblings of the 27-year-old CEO and will provide an insight into the events leading up to the FTX calamity. Bankman-Fried is facing charges of misusing billions of dollars from customer accounts, with eight counts of fraud and election law violations against him. As the CEO of FTX's sister concern Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison was a significant member of the SBF business empire. The New York Times has recently uncovered and reviewed her private Google docs, which have shed light on her mental state during the final months at FTX. The documents, previously unreported, reveal that she was going through a breakup with Sam Bankman-Fried and was plagued with self-doubt about her ability to lead Alameda Research effectively. A Star Witness Against SBF After the collapse of the FTX exchange, Ellison pleaded guilty to fraud charges and agreed to cooperate with authorities in building a case against Bankman-Fried. She is being considered a “star witness” primarily because of her close insight into the FTX ecosystem. Legal experts believe that Ellison's testimony could be the ace up the prosecution's sleeve in Bankman-Fried's trial. The power differential between Ellison and Bankman-Fried makes her a compelling voice, and her candid admissions could hold significant weight in the case against him. Other FTX executives, like Nishad Singh and Gary Wang, have also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. Doubting Her Abilities As CEO The entries in Ellison's diaries revolve around her turbulent relationship with Bankman-Fried, the stress, anxiety, and how it affected her perception of Alameda and its work. She expressed feeling hurt and rejected during their toxic breakups, leading to a decreased excitement about Alameda, as it felt closely associated with him in a painful way. Moreover, she confessed to doubting her own abilities to justify her position at the company, feeling disadvantaged and unsure of her suitability for the role. SBF Lost Confidence In Alameda In April 2022, she wrote that a previous breakup with Bankman-Fried had significantly diminished her enthusiasm about Alameda. Court records show that during this time, Bankman-Fried invested over $400 million in Modulo Capital, a trading company led by someone he had previously dated, indicating his waning faith in Alameda Research. Ellison's writings revealed jealousy and resentment toward Modulo, as she felt sidelined. Sam Bankman-Fried's trial is scheduled to begin in October in Manhattan.

Developers in Nigeria and across Africa can build and test their decentralized applications on the Optimism forked Mara Chain. The network comes on the back of the recent launch of the Mara Wallet, which allows users to trade and withdraw both fiat currencies and tokens.  “Blockchain technology has become a necessary utility and infrastructure that is critical and essential to the development of every country, similar to electricity or the internet,” said Chi Nnadi, CEO of Mara, in an email to CoinDesk. “Opportunities abound in Africa that can be harnessed using blockchain as a technology to deliver widespread utility for African people.”  Testnets are networks that mimic real-world blockchains, allowing developers to test applications and the blockchain for any bugs or deficits ahead of a proper launch.  Among some benefits touted by Mara Chain developers are sub-second transactional speeds, low gas fees, and interoperability with other Optimism-based networks.  Meanwhile, developers said Mara is actively seeking feedback from the developer community and partners to ensure continuous improvement of the platform ahead of the mainnet launch.  “By actively engaging with users, Mara aims to strengthen collaboration and create a supportive ecosystem that nurtures the growth of blockchain applications,” said Mario Karagiorgas, VP of Mara Chain. “There are tangible rewards, bounty grants and development grants for those who work to advance and enhance the capabilities of the Mara Chain.”",POSITIVE,없음,BLOCKCHAIN | FIAT | TECHNOLOGY,Shaurya Malwa,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/tech/2023/07/21/africa-focused-defi-platform-mara-releases-ethereum-compatible-testnet,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/46d6861cd3bb9172c36f82217b1b40e9db67dde8-1440x1080.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

The process refers to staggered releases of specific amounts of cryptocurrencies that had been frozen to prevent early investors or project team members from selling in large numbers.  Unlocks free up liquidity and are widely considered bearish, though some observers say they only accentuate the existing market trend.  New research by analytics firm The Tie shows coins, on average, declined in the lead-up to the event. However, when the liquidity freed up represented more than 100% of the average daily volume, prices quickly recovered, only to fall deeper within two weeks following the unlock. The firm conducted a study of over 350,000 unique unlock events involving more than 100 tokens.  ""In cases where the unlock represented more than 100% of the average daily volume, prices tended to rebound faster, albeit for a brief period. This could be attributed to traders feeling relieved that the unlock did not flood the market with new tokens immediately,"" Lawrence Lewitinn, the director of content at The Tie, wrote in Wednesday's newsletter.  ""Nonetheless, within two weeks, prices of tokens facing such significant unlocks fell below their initial levels at the time of the unlock,"" he wrote. ""This may suggest that holders preferred to wait a few days before selling into the market.""

42393020,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgElgh,1689937918,"Wholesale CBDC Would Improve Cross-Border Payments, French Central Bank Tests Show","The French Central Bank has determined that its wholesale central bank digital currency (wCBDC) would improve cross-border payments, settlement finality and security for a vast range of financial assets after conducting numerous tests using technologies that power crypto, it announced on Friday.  ""Through these experiments, the Banque de France shows the operational feasibility and practical implementation of the three models it has conceptualized for issuing wCBDC directly on DLT [distributed ledger technology],"" the central bank said, adding that different types of DLT were used to test applications in asset tokenization and the improvement of cross-border transactions.  Banque de France began experiments on a wCBDC in March 2020. It conducted a second stage of experiments by mid-2022 and has so far completed twelve experiments, including one to settle a bond worth 100 million euros ($104 million) with Luxembourg. Other experiments include projects with the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Swiss National Bank and the Innovation Hub of the Bank For International Settlements (BIS).  The experiments have shown a wholesale CBDC would ""be key for native digital assets and tokenized assets that fall under the category of unlisted financial assets and which cannot currently be settled,"" according to the bank.  Central banks the world over are actively experimenting on CBDCs to improve wholesale settlements, with monetary authority grouping BIS leading multiple experiments. India has begun similar tests, while the European Central Bank is set to start in 2024. The French central bank said supporting Europe's exploratory work will be one of the next steps.  Among policy takeaways, the French central bank found that issuing a wholesale CBDC would complement a retail CBDCs such as a digital euro. Interoperability for seamless data exchange, international cooperation and public-private partnerships for a more inclusive global CBDC framework remain priorities, the banks said.  According to the bank, ""climate concerns highlight the need to develop energy-efficient solutions in the design of wholesale CBDCs.""

15139207,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543669,1689937203,Solana Boosts Performance With 100% Uptime Record In Q2 2023,"Solana, a key player in the Layer-1 blockchain network domain, has shown a substantial improvement in the network’s uptime and reliability this year, with just one recorded outage so far since the year 2023 began. According to a performance report released by the Solana Foundation on July 20, the network’s stability and performance saw a significant uptick in the first half of 2023. The report presents detailed metrics including the network’s uptime and the ratio of non-voting to voting transactions, which are key indicators of network efficiency and reliability. Addressing The Network Reliability Challenge Despite its promising features, Solana has historically faced issues relating to network uptime and reliability. These problems, referred to as a “curse” by Co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko, were largely attributed to the network’s low-cost transactions, which according to Yakovenko frequently led to Solana network outages. Related Reading: Solana Shining Moment: What To Expect After SOL Crossed $20 1/ The Solana Foundation has released the most recent @Solana Network Performance report. The Solana network’s performance has improved through H1 2023, as measured by uptime, the ratio of non-voting-to-voting transactions, & more. Read the full report: https://t.co/naOftyknLA pic.twitter.com/yI9Q8swWdT — Solana Foundation (@SolanaFndn) July 20, 2023 However, the latest report offers a refreshing contrast to this history, marking a 100% uptime since February 25. This performance ensures that Solana completed an entire quarter without any outages, with the only disruption of the year in February causing a nearly 19-hour network blackout. Indicators Of Network Efficiency In addition to its uptime record, Solana is also making strides in the ratio of voting to non-voting transactions. To clarify, voting transactions are carried out when a validator, a crucial component of the blockchain ecosystem, gets involved in validating and approving one or more proposed data blocks on the network. On the other hand, non-voting transactions are those instigated by user activities on the blockchain, which could include actions such as sending or receiving tokens, executing smart contracts, or interacting with decentralized applications (DApps). The Solana Foundation report also predicts a decreasing these voting-to-non-voting transaction ratios over time, as increased network efficiency should result in a lower overall percentage of voting transactions. Related Reading: SOL Price Prediction: Solana Smashes Key Resistance, $22 Could Be Next Furthermore, Solana’s throughput, measured in terms of transactions per second (TPS), is another vital indicator of network efficiency. The report reveals that Solana’s maximum daily TPS has been on an upward trajectory since January, a trend closely associated with new network upgrades. According to data from Dune Analytics, the transaction rate on the Solana network currently stands at 3,781 transactions per second. Meanwhile, the network’s native token SOL has been in a bearish trend in the past week. Particularly, SOL has plunged by more than 10% in the past 7 days. The asset has dropped from a high of trading above $30 last Friday following a quick spike to a low of $25.39 at the time of writing, down by roughly 6.6% in the past 24 hours.

The government had initially planned to start operations by the end of 2021, but subsequent delays, the most recent in February, saw the launch pushed back. The long-awaited market has been operational since July 17, according to the announcement.  The platform is more like a traditional securities market – the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Tokyo Stock Exchange, etc. – than newfangled crypto exchanges like Binance or Coinbase, given that it's government-approved.  ""The establishment of exchanges, clearing houses and managers of crypto asset storage is proof that the government is present in an effort to create a fair and fair crypto asset trading ecosystem to guarantee legal certainty and prioritize protection for the public as customers,"" Didid Noordiatmoko, head of the Indonesian Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency (Bappebti), said in a statement.  Bappebti will work with the country's Financial Services Authority (OJK), the central bank and the Ministry of Finance in running the platform, CoinDesk Indonesia reported. According to Noordiatmoko, the crypto exchange is designed to help the local industry run smoothly and mitigate crypto-related risks.

The Wormhole Foundation launched a new application-specific blockchain (appchain) into the Cosmos ecosystem Friday morning, making it the first appchain that connects liquidity and users from more than 20 different blockchains to any Cosmos appchain.  According to a Wormhole blog post, the new blockchain called Gateway is designed to make it easier for developers and users to on-ramp tokens to any Cosmos chain, with the purpose of driving “liquidity to grow the Cosmos ecosystem.”  Appchains, such as Gateway, are blockchains customized to operate a single application. Instead of building a decentralized application on top of an underlying blockchain like Ethereum, developers build their own blockchain from the ground up which is usually meant just for a singular application - but one that can be continually upgraded to met user needs.  While Wormhole expanded into the Cosmos ecosystem in 2022 by integrating with Injective, a Cosmos-based blockchain, this launch impacts the entire network of appchains.

15135929,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543658,1689929335,"Dogecoin Sees Positive Price Movement, Bulls Set Crosshair At $0.075","Dogecoin (DOGE) is fixated on a crucial juncture in its price trajectory. Having recently faltered at the previous range-high, the cryptocurrency community eagerly awaits to see whether history will repeat itself. DOGE bulls, ever resilient, have their sights firmly set on re-targeting $0.075 – a level that could signify a significant breakthrough if achieved. As the digital coin continues to command headlines and curiosity, the question on everyone’s mind is whether DOGE can overcome this critical hurdle and forge a path toward new heights. DOGE Bulls Eye Crucial Re-Entry As Price Finds Support As per Coingecko data, DOGE currently stands at $0.071, displaying a modest 24-hour rally of 0.5% alongside consistent seven-day gains of the same percentage. The recent price action indicates that DOGE has established higher highs and lows since mid-June, granting bulls a favorable advantage. Source: Coingecko However, the recovery momentarily stumbled upon reaching the previous range-high of $0.0751. Nevertheless, bullish investors saw an opportunity for re-entry at the price imbalance and FVG (fair value gap) located between $0.0694 to $0.0655. Related Reading: Stellar Makes Surprise 70% Rally – Start Of Something Big For XLM? A DOGE price report reveals a notable pattern where generally, the price tends to hit the FVG before resuming its prior trajectory. This trend has been evident as DOGE has already experienced two rebounds from the FVG zone. Furthermore, this FVG range aligns harmoniously with the ascending trendline support. Dogecoin (DOGE) has a market cap of $10 billion today. Chart: TradingView.com Considering this backdrop, a price rejection at the previous range-high of $0.075 might find support at the above confluence area. Therefore, this confluence area holds significant interest for bullish investors, as it could offer another compelling buying opportunity. Dogecoin Faces Mixed Sentiments While Dogecoin’s popularity as a meme coin remains strong, a separate report paints a sad picture for the cryptocurrency, suggesting that investors are increasingly exploring alternative options. The once-hyped meme coin is trading more than 90% below its all-time high, signaling a significant decline in value. Amidst conflicting views among analysts, some with a bullish outlook foresee a potential surge toward $0.07. However, contrasting opinions assert a more pessimistic perspective, predicting a likely dip below $0.05. DOGE price action in the last seven days.

42393022,CpI5Y2Su0uMQDo69bgEm1D,1689928565,"ProShares Says Bitcoin ETF Has Matched BTC Price Closely, 'Roll Cost' Concerns Are Unwarranted","ProShares, the issuer of the first U.S. bitcoin futures-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF), said concerns that costs associated with trading of the derivatives would lead to tracking errors are unfounded and the product has closely mimicked bitcoin's spot-price performance since day one.  The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy Fund began trading under the ticker BITO on the New York Stock Exchange in October, 2021, allowing investors to gain exposure to bitcoin (BTC) without having to own the cryptocurrency. The ETF, the world's largest crypto fund, invests in regulated and cash-settled bitcoin futures listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).  From the very beginning, observers speculated BITO and other futures-based ETFs would significantly underperform bitcoin due to costs associated with rolling over, or selling expiring futures contracts and buying the next set. Usually, longer-dated futures contracts trade at a premium to those closer to expiry, a condition known as contango. The contango tends to steepen during bull runs, and the steeper the contango, the higher the costs, and the so-called contango bleed.  ""Concerns about the roll costs are misguided; BITO has closely tracked bitcoin's price since inception,"" Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares, told CoinDesk in an email interview. ""Since its inception (through 7/18), BITO has returned -54.5% compared to -51.5% for bitcoin. And over half of that modest difference is BITO's fee of 95bps per annum.""  Bitcoin's recent rally and the resulting widening of contango at the end of June have revived concerns about the roll costs and strengthened calls for spot-based ETFs, which invest directly in bitcoin and eliminate the need to roll over positions. Since June 15, a number of traditional finance giants like BlackRock, Invesco and others have filed applications with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for spot-based bitcoin ETFs.  According to Hyman, BITO continues to closely track the spot price as the fund's interest income from cash holdings compensates for the roll costs, which are closely tied to the level of interest rates in the U.S. economy.  ""For a financial future with no storage costs, as is the case with the CME bitcoin futures, the futures contract premium should be in the ballpark of the term-equivalent interest rate. The Fed's raising of the benchmark interest rate by 500 basis points since March 2022 has been a key driver of those premiums, and consequently the roll costs of a bitcoin futures strategy,"" Hyman said.  ""Here's the key piece of the puzzle. BITO earns interest on its cash balances which are driven by those same term-equivalent interest rates, which offset the roll costs. The result is close tracking to the price movements of spot bitcoin,"" Hyman added.  As Hyman says, one component of futures prices is interest rates, and the U.S. Federal Reserve has lifted its target range to 5%-5.25% to control inflation. Other variables include the price of the underlying asset, storage costs and convenience yield. The CME bitcoin futures are cash-settled, so there also no storage costs.  BITO earns interest from its cash holdings. The interest income is paid out in monthly dividends and covers the roll decay in the fund. BITO has paid dividends six times this year.  When asked if potential spot ETFs would drive investors away from futures-based products, Hyman said it's tough to speculate on products that don't exist.  ""BITO’s track record of performance and flows are a testament to the effectiveness of a bitcoin futures strategy within an ETF and investor interest,"" Hyman noted.  As of July 18, the ProShares ETF had $1.1 billion in assets under management. It has seen year-to-date inflows of $336.2 million. Since its inception, the fund has amassed $2.2 billion in investor money.  The market expects a potential launch of spot-based ETFs to unlock floodgates for institutional money.",POSITIVE,BTC,BTC | BUSINESS | EXCHANGE | MARKET | TRADING,Omkar Godbole,0,0,CoinDesk,https://coindesk.com/markets/2023/07/21/proshares-says-bitcoin-etf-has-matched-btc-price-closely-roll-cost-concerns-are-unwarranted,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/875e9aaa68633178a43e12313aa71bb26749cd46-1440x810.jpg?w=300&h=300&fit=crop

As part of the partnership between the organizations, the World App and the World ID protocol would migrate from Polygon to the Optimism mainnet. Worldcoin Foundation and Tools for Humanity had stated at the time, “With more than 1.6 million sign-ups in beta and 500,000+ monthly active World App users, the deployments on OP Mainnet will expand access and help Worldcoin reach a values-aligned ecosystem of developers and users.” With the World App and World ID migration to Optimism complete, World App has now begun the process of user migration from Polygon to Optimism, intending to scale Web3 identity and governance on the Optimism Superchain. World App users and World ID holders will see a plethora of changes, such as the Worldcoin protocol migrating to Ethereum to support World ID. Additionally, a majority of Safe wallets have been deployed on the OP mainnet, with the remainder set to be deployed on user-initiated migration. Following the migration, World App also supports Uniswap on the OP mainnet. A Boost For Optimism Worldcoin believes that the migration of World ID to the OP mainnet could significantly boost the capabilities of Optimism’s Citizen House. Citizen House works in tandem with the Token House to govern the larger Optimism Collective. World ID could also help enhance Optimism Collective’s AttestationStation, a shared database designed to make the verification of information easier, and creates a strong network of trust on OP chains within the Superchain. World ID SDK Publicly Available Worldcoin has also made its World ID software development kit (SDK) publicly available to developers through a limited waitlist. Worldcoin’s World ID software development kit has been critical in building over 100 projects, including flagship integrations such as Okta’s Auth0 and Talent Protocol. The former is a global authentication and authorization platform, while the latter is a social and economic platform designed for Web3 builders based in Europe. The World ID software development kit includes a developer portal, web widget (JS), development simulator, and a comprehensive guide. Thanks to its permissionless architecture, it can support open identity standards and currently supports OAuth 2.0 and OIDC (OpenID Connect). There are plans to introduce support for Verifiable Credentials (VCs), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), and Sign in with Ethereum (SIWE) in the near future. Just last week, Worldcoin hit a significant milestone, registering 2 million World ID signups in its beta phase. The signups are an indication of World ID’s global reach and appeal, with users registering from several cities, such as Buenos Aires, New York, Berlin, Barcelona, Tokyo, and Seoul.

The new lawsuit, filed Thursday, alleges that the defendants used their close control over the FTX Group's businesses and systems to perpetrate what it calls a massive fraud between February 2020 and November 2022, squandering FTX’s assets on luxury homes, political and ""charitable"" contributions, and various investments.  Read more: Alameda Seeks Return of $700M Paid to ‘Super Networkers’ for Celebrity, Political Access  According to the filing, FTX issued more than $725 million worth of equity to Bankman-Fried, former CTO and Co-Founder Gary Wang, Director of Engineering Nishad Singh, and former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison. Of this $725 million, $447.8 million allegedly went to Singh, and the lawsuit documents how it was recorded as a loan between Singh, trading arm Alameda and FTX.  “In reality, no one paid for the shares, and no one intended to do so,” the lawsuit reads.  The lawsuit also alleges that FTX transferred $4.86 million to the group in order to purchase real estate, and Bankman-Fried’s father, Allen “Joe” Bankman, received $10 million from Alameda to be used for legal expenses.  It also says that Gabriel Bankman-Fried, Sam’s brother, planned to purchase the nation of Nauru – a small island northeast of Australia – with FTX Foundation funds, and more than $100 million in political donations to both parties and political action committees were made from funds mixed with FTX customer money.  Caroline Ellison, who has a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York, is accused of awarding herself a $22.5 million bonus at the height of FTX’s crisis last November.  Recently, the U.S. Department of Justice asked a court to silence Bankman-Fried from making out-of-court statements about the case after he leaked Ellison’s private diary to the New York Times.

42410157,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTynh,1689924725,Move Over Shiba Inu: Crypto Community Flirts With Hamster Race Betting,"Crypto traders have found a novel way to generate returns as bitcoin (BTC) remains flat and the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector fails to fully shake off the bear market lull.  Actual hamsters – the living, breathing, and oft-cute rodents – have been put to the races on the blockchain-based platform Hamsters.gg. “The hamsters are real and the bets are real. The hamsters are running on a track and the first hamster to cross the finish line wins,” the site explains.  Star hamster racers like “Rocky” and “Buster” are already drawing bets of up to $500 per race. Others like “CK” aren’t so lucky – losing 326 races; winning just 8. These races seem to occur every few hours, during which a chatbox lights up, drawing at least 1,000 viewers and complete with virtual beer and hotdog emojis.  “Sipping wine, betting on hamster racing...does it get any better than this?,” a recent message on the Hamsters chatbox reads. Some others are trying to mathematically win: “Who's got some stats on these hamsters? do we have weight classes?”  Crypto traders have a knack for jumping on gambling platforms and memecoins, mainly after the rise of tokens such as dogecoin (DOGE) and shiba inu (SHIB) – which jumped to tens of billions in market capitalization in the previous bull market.  Anyone can call a smart contract and issue tokens on Ethereum (or other blockchains) for a few cents, and the presence of decentralized exchanges means tokens can instantly be issued, supplied with liquidity and traded soon after.  Most of these do not last beyond a few weeks. Last year saw hopefuls bet on articles from the English language to McDonald’s branded Grimacecoins, both of which fell to nearly zero after a few weeks of trading. But some, like Pepecoin (PEPE), jump to billions in market capitalization and seem to become big-name projects.  Data shows HamstersGG went live earlier in July and live-streamed a series of races through Twitch on Thursday. Bets could be placed via U.S. dollar-pegged binance USD (BUSD) by depositing tokens from either Ethereum or BNB Chain.  And – to little surprise – there’s a HAMS token as well. A whitepaper on the Hamsters.gg site explains the platform takes a 5% cut of all bets, of which 4% is distributed to HAMS token holders.  The Ethereum-based HAMS has zooted to over $6 million capitalization nearly overnight. On-chain data shows each HAMS exchanged hands for 60 cents at the time of writing time, a nearly 1,000% increase compared to Thursday. A Uniswap pool holds $450,000 in liquidity and has garnered $9 million in trading volumes over the past 24 hours.  Meanwhile, Hamsters.gg developers say this is just the start of the novel hamster betting platform. ""Our vision is for long-term development and scalability.

15133749,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=543636,1689924007,Market Alert: Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Capitulation Triggers Cautionary Outlook,"Charles Edwards, the mastermind behind the Bitcoin Hash Ribbons signal and founder of Capriole Investments, has sounded the alarm. The renowned analyst warns that the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal just flashed, a phenomenon that has historically accompanied moments of distress for BTC miners. As outlined by Edwards, Bitcoin’s hash rate had experienced an astonishing and seemingly unsustainable 50% surge in 2023. However, this meteoric rise came to a sudden slowdown, which has led to the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal to appear. Via Twitter, Edwards emphasized that the signal is neither a clear sell signal nor a buy indicator. But it demands prudent risk management until a renewed price rally: We have a Hash Ribbon capitulation. AKA a slowing in Bitcoin’s Hash Rate growth after what has been an incredible (unsustainable) 50% increase in 2023. Hash Ribbons capitulation is not a sell signal, but it’s also not bullish. Risk management warranted until growth resumes. Market analyst Lukasz Wydra corroborates Edwards’ stance, pointing out that the death cross of Bitcoin hash ribbons is a signal of a time of uncertainty. Wydra revealed that historically, there have been 14 similar events, each leading to diverse outcomes. Among these events, three resulted in rallies, six led to sideways movements, and five triggered declines. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Blofin Forecasts $49,000 Price High With Potential Spot ETF Launch Wydra takes a statistical approach and reassures investors that, statistically speaking, the Hash Ribbons capitulation does not inflict significant harm on the market. In fact, he emphasizes that when the capitulation finally subsides, it will usher in a strong buying signal, one that has shown remarkable effectiveness in the past. The last time the Hash Ribbons capitulation signal appeared was at the end of November 2022. It was followed by a prolonged sideways trend for over a month until the buy signal flashed at the beginning of January. The result? Bitcoin embarked on a furious rally, etching a memorable start to the year. Why Bitcoin Hash Ribbons Are Such A Powerful Tool In simple terms, the Hash Ribbon indicator is designed to detect periods when BTC miners are facing distress and possible capitulation. These phases tend to coincide with major lows in the price of Bitcoin, making them attractive buying opportunities for astute investors. Related Reading: Bitcoin, XRP, & Ethereum: Three Top Coins On Brink Of Golden Cross Miners play a crucial role in securing the Bitcoin network and processing transactions. During periods of rapid price surges followed by sharp pullbacks, some miners may find it financially challenging to continue their operations, leading them to power down their mining rigs. Charles Edwards elucidates that when miners capitulate, it might be the most potent buy signal observable in the Bitcoin market. However, the indicator does not claim to time the exact bottom of the price. Instead, it identifies periods when miners are turning off their rigs due to adverse market conditions, leading to drops in hash rates. These moments often correspond to macro bottoms in Bitcoin’s price, making them opportune moments to accumulate Bitcoin. At press time, BTC traded near the range lows at $29,863.

42410143,GJVPKSa3D710Liw1gcTy06,1689921607,SBF Accused of Leaking Caroline Ellison's Private Diary by U.S. DOJ,"The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has accused former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried of leaking the private diary of ex-Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison to the New York Times.  The accusation comes after the NYT published an article which had Ellison's private musings, leading to the DOJ seeking a ban on all out-of-court statements made by witnesses and other parties in the case.  “The defendant’s actions—sharing personal writings of Caroline Ellison’s with a New York Times reporter—implicate the core concern of Rule 23.1 that disseminating material related to the “testimony or credibility of prospective witnesses” presumptively involves a substantial likelihood or prejudice to a fair trial and the due administration of justice,"" the U.S. Attorneys wrote.  Rule 23.1(a) forbids lawyers and their agents from releasing non-public information about a case if it is likely to interfere with a fair trial.  The attorneys argue that an order restricting extrajudicial statements is necessary due to the intense media attention this case has received and the defendant's attempt to manipulate media coverage to his advantage.  They also say that the defendant's actions may taint the jury pool and constitute harassment of Ellison. They are also concerned that this would deter other potential trial witnesses from testifying due to fear of public humiliation and personal discrediting.  This request comes as FTX’s interim leadership has filed a separate civil case against Bankman-Fried, Ellison, and other executives seeking to recover cash and reverse transactions that are collectively worth over $1 billion.  Among the allegations in the lawsuit are that Bankman-Fried diverted $10 million of FTX.US funds to his personal account, his brother Gabriel planned to buy the island nation of Nauru with foundation funds, and over $100 million was donated politically using mixed company-customer funds.

In a screen grab shared on Twitter, on-chain data reveals that more XRP was being traded in bulk, driving trading volumes higher across the board. Accompanying the expansion, prices remain higher as of writing on July 20. The coin is up 72% from July 2023 lows, even though trading volumes in leading exchanges, including Binance, have since tapered slightly. Nonetheless, the resurgence in trading volumes this week suggests that the demand for the coin remains relatively higher. XRP And Its Spectacular Rally The token’s value experienced a surge following a recent court ruling declaring that the SEC could not provide evidence that it was a security. Per the Howey test, the judge concluded that XRP does not meet the legal definition of a security. Related Reading: SEC Allegedly Delays Assistance For US Crypto Market Bill Three years ago, in December 2020, the regulator filed a lawsuit alleging that Ripple, the blockchain company, and some of its executives, including Brad Garlinghouse, had raised over $1 billion through alleged illegal sales of XRP, an asset they claimed was an unregistered security. Ripple denied the allegations and fought the lawsuit, expending millions of dollars in legal expenses and eventually winning on this item. Coinbase, Bitstamp, Crypto Exchanges Relisting The rally has also been boosted by the news that Coinbase Global, Kraken, and other top-tier cryptocurrency exchanges have relisted the token. Specifically, Coinbase delisted XRP in December 2020 following the SEC lawsuit, triggering a wave of delisting among cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States. Relisting XRP across major exchanges could be a sign of confidence. It will likely boost the coin’s liquidity, increasing trading volumes in the coming months. Supporters find the listing a refreshing development, especially for clients in the United States who had been cut off from trading. Related Reading: Terraform Labs Appoints New CEO Following Do Kwon’s Sentencing In Montenegro Some predictions maintain that the token rally will likely continue in H2 2023. Judge Analisa Torres’ ruling in favor of Ripple Labs removed uncertainty around the coin’s status. This decision can also open more doors for institutional adoption. Moreover, the rally and regulatory clarity cement the token’s position in the cryptocurrency market. This development may see it narrow its gap with Ethereum (ETH), perhaps even flipping it to become the second-largest coin after Bitcoin. In the last three years before the court ruling, the token shook off weakness and retained its slot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization amid the biting and extended crypto winter 2022.

The path to achieving this transformation remains ambiguous as we witness the emergence of Web3, a paradigm shift from platform-centric to user-centric networking. The crucial aspect of a user-centric network lies in users defining their identities and determining the information they wish to share with others. After years of unwavering dedication, the MetaBlox team has released a breakthrough protocol that uses DIDs to provide a decentralized groundwork for creating a user-centric network. The team is diligently working to build the foundation for a web3 user-centric network that can support web3 native apps. The MetaBlox Network mobile app represents a major step toward this lofty goal. With this software, users may take the first necessary step toward gaining access to a Free Privacy Protected WiFi Network by registering a DID and automatically uploading it to the blockchain and, in the process, earn mPoints that can be used on the further development of the network. The platform has a lot of benefits that make it stand out. First and foremost, the team believes that the most compelling aspect of MetaBlox is that it is a user-centric network supported by a rewarding system for its users and builders. MetaBlox hopes to model itself after the prosperous Web 2.0 period, during which prominent corporations gave away their services for free to demonstrate the efficacy of their monetization schemes. In Web 3.0, MetaBlox seeks to replicate this prosperity with a significant distinction. Instead of profits accruing solely to private entities, MetaBlox positions itself as a decentralized solution, enabling users and network maintainers to reap the rewards. Unlike the Helium Network, which employs LORA technology, MetaBlox operates as a WiFi Network, affording the bandwidth necessary to accommodate many users, thus substantially expanding monetization opportunities for all stakeholders involved. Powering the User-Oriented Web3: MetaBlox's OpenRoaming Initiative and Decentralized Connectivity MetaBlox's decentralized OpenRoaming WiFi Network made great strides toward creating a user-oriented Web3. Several major Web3 investment businesses and organizations contributed over $2 million to the initiative. The OpenRoaming Network expanded the worldwide WiFi network by deploying hundreds of MetaBlox Miners as blockchain nodes, allowing for secure, password-free, automated connections using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). To create an OpenRoaming network with over a million access points, MetaBlox collaborated with the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA). The WBA Wireless Global Congress also saw a successful demonstration of their technology. Users may now create their own WiFi OpenRoaming profiles and have access to Web3 capabilities with the newly released software. Notably, MetaBlox teamed up with other initiatives such as Harmony, Caldance, Memolabs, and Deeper Network to accomplish its goals. MetaBlox Network's Blockchain Integration for DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs MetaBlox Network uses blockchain technology to improve the quality of its products and services significantly. Because of Blockchain technology, users' hotspot routers may double as crypto miners, earning them tokens in exchange for giving WiFi access. With this decentralized deployment approach, MetaBlox Network can steadily increase its worldwide presence and reach as an incentive for network development. In addition, combining the MetaBlox Network with blockchain technology unleashes many novel possibilities. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, game finance (GameFi) ecosystems, and NFT markets may all be accessed confidentially and safely by users. Individuals may make money with digital assets by participating in farming and staking activities on DeFi networks. At the same time, the system provides unhindered entry to the increasing universe of GameFi and Play-to-Earn games, with strong security provided by blockchain-held credentials in place of the more archaic passwords. MetaBlox Network was developed in response to the rapidly growing NFT sector, and it provides users with simple access to NFT markets and wallets by use of their DIDs. The firm has established its collection of utility-based NFTs, seen on major platforms like OpenSea, as evidence of its dedication to the blockchain ecosystem. MetaBlox Network aims to offer a genuinely user-centric experience that adapts to the new digital environment by integrating Web3, the Metaverse, 5G rollout, DeFi, and DID-based technologies. MetaBlox's $MBLX Token and Its Role in Decentralized Network Development MetaBlox is hard at work creating a user-focused, open, and free system for anyone who wants to use it. To encourage the development of a native Web3 network, which is in accordance with this goal, the $MBLX token has been introduced. Businesses that want to sell goods or provide services inside the MetaBlox ecosystem are the primary target users of the $MBLX token. These companies actively contribute to developing decentralized ownership inside the next generation of wireless networks by earning and using $MBLX tokens. The $MBLX token's main benefit over competing tokens is that it was made with Web3 users' insatiable curiosity about the platform's features in mind. These customers can take advantage of all the Web3 ecosystem offers once they adopt $MBLX. MetaBlox's Founding Members and Their Remarkable Technological Achievements The first MetaBlox team mostly comprises employees from the leading organizations that make up the alliance's founding members, which are located in North America and Asia. These businesses focus on developing and implementing state-of-the-art technologies, including blockchain, IoT, Telco, AI, and financial services. The alliance members range from large, publicly traded corporations to small, innovative startups, but they all have one thing in common: a desire to build a Web3 network that puts users' wants and needs first. The founding coalition has made great progress and accomplished outstanding feats during the previous four years. They collaborated with the Canadian federal government on the first blockchain program, among other pioneering endeavors. Further distinguishing themselves, they were the first group to combine blockchain technology with eSIM and Bluetooth chips. It's worth noting that the alliance members are active contributors to the Decentralized ID Foundation. This shows their dedication to spreading the use of decentralized identification systems. WiGig is a broadband version of WiFi, and the alliance members are among the few businesses in the world that have access to this technology. Their proficiency with WiGig technology enables them to provide reliable and fast wireless network options. Their work in the development of AI is another significant achievement of the original alliance members. They are pioneers in AI edge computing, having designed and produced one of the earliest system-on-a-chip (SOC) devices. This technological advancement provides high-performance and smart computing capabilities at the network's periphery, allowing for instantaneous data processing and analysis. Members of the alliance have made significant investments in several high-profile initiatives throughout the decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming finance (GameFi), and non-fungible token (NFT) spaces, demonstrating their commitment to the development of these industries beyond just technological means. Investing in promising startups like 1inch and Axie Infinity demonstrates their dedication to fostering growth and development in the nascent blockchain industry. Final Thoughts The advent of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) has the potential to reshape the future of the internet by revolutionizing the way we verify our digital identities. As Web3 emerges, shifting from platform-centric to user-centric networking, the MetaBlox team has made remarkable progress in developing a protocol that leverages DIDs to establish a decentralized foundation for a user-centric network. Their commitment to building a web3 native network that supports user-centric applications is evident in the MetaBlox Network mobile app. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The path to achieving this transformation remains ambiguous as we witness the emergence of Web3, a paradigm shift from platform-centric to user-centric networking. The crucial aspect of a user-centric network lies in users defining their identities and determining the information they wish to share with others. After years of unwavering dedication, the MetaBlox team has released a breakthrough protocol that uses DIDs to provide a decentralized groundwork for creating a user-centric network. The team is diligently working to build the foundation for a web3 user-centric network that can support web3 native apps. The MetaBlox Network mobile app represents a major step toward this lofty goal. With this software, users may take the first necessary step toward gaining access to a Free Privacy Protected WiFi Network by registering a DID and automatically uploading it to the blockchain and, in the process, earn mPoints that can be used on the further development of the network. The platform has a lot of benefits that make it stand out. First and foremost, the team believes that the most compelling aspect of MetaBlox is that it is a user-centric network supported by a rewarding system for its users and builders. MetaBlox hopes to model itself after the prosperous Web 2.0 period, during which prominent corporations gave away their services for free to demonstrate the efficacy of their monetization schemes. In Web 3.0, MetaBlox seeks to replicate this prosperity with a significant distinction. Instead of profits accruing solely to private entities, MetaBlox positions itself as a decentralized solution, enabling users and network maintainers to reap the rewards. Unlike the Helium Network, which employs LORA technology, MetaBlox operates as a WiFi Network, affording the bandwidth necessary to accommodate many users, thus substantially expanding monetization opportunities for all stakeholders involved. Powering the User-Oriented Web3: MetaBlox's OpenRoaming Initiative and Decentralized Connectivity MetaBlox's decentralized OpenRoaming WiFi Network made great strides toward creating a user-oriented Web3. Several major Web3 investment businesses and organizations contributed over $2 million to the initiative. The OpenRoaming Network expanded the worldwide WiFi network by deploying hundreds of MetaBlox Miners as blockchain nodes, allowing for secure, password-free, automated connections using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). To create an OpenRoaming network with over a million access points, MetaBlox collaborated with the Wireless Broadband Alliance (WBA). The WBA Wireless Global Congress also saw a successful demonstration of their technology. Users may now create their own WiFi OpenRoaming profiles and have access to Web3 capabilities with the newly released software. Notably, MetaBlox teamed up with other initiatives such as Harmony, Caldance, Memolabs, and Deeper Network to accomplish its goals. MetaBlox Network's Blockchain Integration for DeFi, GameFi, and NFTs MetaBlox Network uses blockchain technology to improve the quality of its products and services significantly. Because of Blockchain technology, users' hotspot routers may double as crypto miners, earning them tokens in exchange for giving WiFi access. With this decentralized deployment approach, MetaBlox Network can steadily increase its worldwide presence and reach as an incentive for network development. In addition, combining the MetaBlox Network with blockchain technology unleashes many novel possibilities. Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, game finance (GameFi) ecosystems, and NFT markets may all be accessed confidentially and safely by users.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, was recently trading at $29,809, down slightly over the past 24 hours. At one point during the day, BTC dipped perilously near a one-month low set earlier this week near $29,500. More than five weeks after spiking following multiple spot bitcoin ETF filings, bitcoin has been unable to escape the $30,000 to $31,000 range – at least for long.  “There’s a lot of bearish sentiment on Crypto Twitter about this pullback, but I think the factors behind it are pretty simple,"" Anthony Georgiades, co-founder of NFT and Web3 blockchain Pastel Network, wrote in an email to CoinDesk.  Georgiades noted that the tech sell-off that was at least partly spurred by comments from Tesla founder Elon Musk that the electric car maker might have to reduce prices, and the strengthening dollar, had weighed on ""bitcoin and the broader crypto market.""  Ether, the second largest crypto in market value, was recently changing hands at $1,892, up a smidgen from Wednesday, same time. Most other major cryptos by market cap spent Thursday slogging into the red with XRP losing some of its big gains from the day before to trade below 80 cents – recently off more than 4%, and ADA and SOL, the tokens of smart contract platforms Cardano and Solana, down nearly as much.  The big exception was LINK, the native currency of the Chainlink software platform that connects blockchains with external data. It recently soared by more than 20% to trade above $8 after whales acquired more than $6 million of the token, an apparent reaction to Chainlink's release of an interoperability protocol.

Equity markets were mixed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average continuing a recent winning streak but the Nasdaq plummeting more than 2% on the Tesla news and soft earnings by streaming service Netflix. In a note to CoinDesk, Mark Connors, head of research at Canadian digital asset manager 3iQ, also highlighted missed results by Taiwan Semiconductor, which put ""an extra hit on AI stocks."" The dollar index tipped downward to continue a recent trend.  Still, Pastel Network's Georgiades was cautiously upbeat about crypto markets. ""The underlying sentiment hasn’t changed much since yesterday or the preceding days,"" he wrote. I know the permabears have been calling for a major selloff, but it seems less likely that this is in the cards.  He added: ""Monetary conditions are likely to loosen here soon, and that will help serve as a catalyst for risk-on assets.”     Biggest Gainers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Gala GALA +2.4% Entertainment Ethereum ETH +0.4% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +0.3% Smart Contract Platform  Biggest Losers  Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Stellar XLM −17.4% Smart Contract Platform XRP XRP −6.6% Currency Cardano ADA −6.2% Smart Contract Platform  Insights  Fear and Greed Turns Neutral  The Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index has fallen into neutral territory, indicating that investor sentiment for the asset has cooled recently.  The metric, derived by Alternative.me, gauges investor sentiment across five distinct factors, and distills them into one number ranging from 0-100. Readings close to 0 indicate extreme fear, while readings closer to 100 indicate extreme greed.  Often, extreme fear coincides with buying opportunities, as investors are likely behaving too cautiously. Extreme greed can coincide with a market that is overheated.  The most recent reading indicates a market that is in flux, with neither bulls or bears willing to take a strong stance in either direction.  All told, the reading adds evidence that BTC is poised to trade in a range for the foreseeable future.
